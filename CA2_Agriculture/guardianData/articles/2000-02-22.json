      "body": "<p>Perhaps it was the pain of defeat that caused them to go into hiding, or maybe it was just a rare chance to spend a few days at home with family and friends and relax in the sunshine. </p> <p>Whatever the reasons, some of Nigeria's footballers will have an awful lot of explaining to do over the next few days as mystery continues to surround their sluggish returns to their European club sides more than a week after losing on penalties to Cameroon in the African Nations Cup final. </p> <p>The way was led by Chelsea's Celestine Babayaro, who could teach David Beckham a thing or two about going Awol. The Nigerian defender was supposed to report back for training last Tuesday and was even named in the squad for the FA Cup tie against Gillingham on Sunday. </p> <p>The club claim they have not received any explanations as to why he has not returned to west London but depending on who you talk to Babayaro has either become stranded in his native northern Nigeria because of ethnic violence or cannot leave the country because of serious illness. </p> <p>Babayaro's guardian claimed yesterday that the player was unable to leave his hometown of Kaduna because of violence between Muslims and Christians which has resulted in two deaths. </p> <p>Alhaji Sabo Babayaro said: \"He has been delayed because of the rioting. He was supposed to leave today for Lagos on his way back to London. But as I speak to you now Celestine is trapped.\" </p> <p>However, the Nigerian high commission in London, which maintains close contacts with Nigerian footballers in Britain, has a different explanation. It says Babayaro is trapped on doctor's orders. </p> <p>\"He has malaria and is in quarantine,\" said a spokesman. \"I spoke to his sister and she told me that Celestine is not well and has been put into quarantine by the doctor. He will not be allowed out of the country until he has recovered. </p> <p>\"Celestine's sister said that he will be back very soon and he is resting. We have told Chelsea that he has malaria but we couldn't give a definite date as to when he will return.\" </p> <p>Chelsea are to report the matter to Fifa and have warned that he faces disciplinary action when he returns. </p> <p>The Luton Town centre-half Efetobore Sodje had been given a definite date of last Tuesday to return to the Bedfordshire club but instead, according to club officials, Sodje strolled into the club yesterday morning without explaining adequately where he had been or why he had returned so late. </p> <p>To rub further salt into Luton's wound, Sodje had in fact been released for international duty two weeks earlier than Nigerian players from the Premiership because he was not even sure he was going to make it into the final squad of 22. When he did make it, he failed to inform the club, who only found out via his wife. </p> <p>A bemused Lennie Lawrence, the Luton manager, yesterday fined and disciplined Sodje and placed him on the transfer list. </p> <p>At least two other Nigerian players at clubs on the continent, Jay-Jay Okocha of Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund's Victor Ikpeba, are reported to have failed to return, although neither club could confirm this yesterday, while two other clubs are anxiously awaiting the return of their players, fingers crossed. </p> <p>The Arsenal striker Nwankwo Kanu and Milan's Taribo West have both been given extra leave to visit relatives in Nigeria. \"We are expecting Kanu back sometime this week,\" said a spokesman for Arsenal, who did not have a fixture last weekend. \"It's not as if he's late. There's no reason to be worried, as yet.\" Milan are adopting a similar line, particularly as West is not currently in the first team. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Nigerians themselves have a more pragmatic view of their players' actions. \"I can't see what all the fuss is about,\" said the Nigerian high commission spokesman. \"The players were very upset at losing the final and many have not been home for a while.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Perhaps it was the pain of defeat that caused them to go into hiding, or maybe it was just a rare chance to spend a few days at home with family and friends and relax in the sunshine. Whatever the reasons, some of Nigeria's footballers will have an awful lot of explaining to do over the next few days as mystery continues to surround their sluggish returns to their European club sides more than a week after losing on penalties to Cameroon in the African Nations Cup final. The way was led by Chelsea's Celestine Babayaro, who could teach David Beckham a thing or two about going Awol. The Nigerian defender was supposed to report back for training last Tuesday and was even named in the squad for the FA Cup tie against Gillingham on Sunday. The club claim they have not received any explanations as to why he has not returned to west London but depending on who you talk to Babayaro has either become stranded in his native northern Nigeria because of ethnic violence or cannot leave the country because of serious illness. Babayaro's guardian claimed yesterday that the player was unable to leave his hometown of Kaduna because of violence between Muslims and Christians which has resulted in two deaths. Alhaji Sabo Babayaro said: \"He has been delayed because of the rioting. He was supposed to leave today for Lagos on his way back to London. But as I speak to you now Celestine is trapped.\" However, the Nigerian high commission in London, which maintains close contacts with Nigerian footballers in Britain, has a different explanation. It says Babayaro is trapped on doctor's orders. \"He has malaria and is in quarantine,\" said a spokesman. \"I spoke to his sister and she told me that Celestine is not well and has been put into quarantine by the doctor. He will not be allowed out of the country until he has recovered. \"Celestine's sister said that he will be back very soon and he is resting. We have told Chelsea that he has malaria but we couldn't give a definite date as to when he will return.\" Chelsea are to report the matter to Fifa and have warned that he faces disciplinary action when he returns. The Luton Town centre-half Efetobore Sodje had been given a definite date of last Tuesday to return to the Bedfordshire club but instead, according to club officials, Sodje strolled into the club yesterday morning without explaining adequately where he had been or why he had returned so late. To rub further salt into Luton's wound, Sodje had in fact been released for international duty two weeks earlier than Nigerian players from the Premiership because he was not even sure he was going to make it into the final squad of 22. When he did make it, he failed to inform the club, who only found out via his wife. A bemused Lennie Lawrence, the Luton manager, yesterday fined and disciplined Sodje and placed him on the transfer list. At least two other Nigerian players at clubs on the continent, Jay-Jay Okocha of Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund's Victor Ikpeba, are reported to have failed to return, although neither club could confirm this yesterday, while two other clubs are anxiously awaiting the return of their players, fingers crossed. The Arsenal striker Nwankwo Kanu and Milan's Taribo West have both been given extra leave to visit relatives in Nigeria. \"We are expecting Kanu back sometime this week,\" said a spokesman for Arsenal, who did not have a fixture last weekend. \"It's not as if he's late. There's no reason to be worried, as yet.\" Milan are adopting a similar line, particularly as West is not currently in the first team. Meanwhile, the Nigerians themselves have a more pragmatic view of their players' actions. \"I can't see what all the fuss is about,\" said the Nigerian high commission spokesman. \"The players were very upset at losing the final and many have not been home for a while.\"",

      "body": "<p>David Beckham's advisers claimed yesterday that he had \"been given no reason whatsoever\" for being banished from training and dropped from Manchester United's first-team after incurring the wrath of his manager Sir Alex Ferguson. </p> <p>As Beckham attempted to focus on England's game against Argentina tomorrow, the London-based public relations company employed to promote his image was anxious to portray the player as victim. </p> <p>Beckham's spokeswoman Caroline McAteer said her client had been culpable of nothing more than being a responsible parent after giving United notice of his plans to miss training on Friday because his baby boy Brooklyn had fallen ill during the night. </p> <p>\"At 3am David called out a doctor who diagnosed Brooklyn had a touch of gastro-enteritis. He let the club know and you would have thought it was a valid excuse,\" she said. \"Then, when he turned up for training on Saturday Ferguson told him to leave. Obviously he was not played [at Leeds] on Sunday but he has been given no reason whatsoever.\" It is believed, however, that he gave United only 20 minutes' notice of his decision to miss training. </p> <p>Beckham's faltering relationship with Ferguson was described as \"near unworkable\" by an informed source yesterday, while several senior United players are understood to have warned their colleague about the potentially damaging effect his millionaire lifestyle could have on his playing career. </p> <p>His omission at Elland Road shows that Ferguson is no longer willing to tolerate the 24-year-old leading his dual life between Old Trafford and the Hertfordshire home he shares with his pop-star wife Victoria Adams, although his advisers are adamant he is not seeking a move. Ferguson was refusing to discuss the situation yesterday, reiterating his view that it was an internal matter. </p> <p>Beckham's use of PR spinners from The Outside Organisation is more in keeping with the pop industry and is likely to serve only to inflame his manager. Ferguson is renowned for his efforts to keep matters in-house and will not be impressed to have his authority challenged by a company 200 miles away. </p> <p>Ferguson does not tolerate his employees bringing bad publicity to the club and anyone who does not abide by his stringent regulations is usually left in the wilderness; Beckham will have some further explaining to do when he returns to the club's training complex in Carrington later this week. </p> <p>\u0095 Manchester United's captain Roy Keane has said that he and his team-mates \"went too far\" when they chased the referee Andy d'Urso after he awarded Middlesbrough a penalty at Old Trafford 3 weeks ago. \"It won't be happening again,\" Keane said. \"I know I should have been setting a better example.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Beckham's advisers claimed yesterday that he had \"been given no reason whatsoever\" for being banished from training and dropped from Manchester United's first-team after incurring the wrath of his manager Sir Alex Ferguson. As Beckham attempted to focus on England's game against Argentina tomorrow, the London-based public relations company employed to promote his image was anxious to portray the player as victim. Beckham's spokeswoman Caroline McAteer said her client had been culpable of nothing more than being a responsible parent after giving United notice of his plans to miss training on Friday because his baby boy Brooklyn had fallen ill during the night. \"At 3am David called out a doctor who diagnosed Brooklyn had a touch of gastro-enteritis. He let the club know and you would have thought it was a valid excuse,\" she said. \"Then, when he turned up for training on Saturday Ferguson told him to leave. Obviously he was not played [at Leeds] on Sunday but he has been given no reason whatsoever.\" It is believed, however, that he gave United only 20 minutes' notice of his decision to miss training. Beckham's faltering relationship with Ferguson was described as \"near unworkable\" by an informed source yesterday, while several senior United players are understood to have warned their colleague about the potentially damaging effect his millionaire lifestyle could have on his playing career. His omission at Elland Road shows that Ferguson is no longer willing to tolerate the 24-year-old leading his dual life between Old Trafford and the Hertfordshire home he shares with his pop-star wife Victoria Adams, although his advisers are adamant he is not seeking a move. Ferguson was refusing to discuss the situation yesterday, reiterating his view that it was an internal matter. Beckham's use of PR spinners from The Outside Organisation is more in keeping with the pop industry and is likely to serve only to inflame his manager. Ferguson is renowned for his efforts to keep matters in-house and will not be impressed to have his authority challenged by a company 200 miles away. Ferguson does not tolerate his employees bringing bad publicity to the club and anyone who does not abide by his stringent regulations is usually left in the wilderness; Beckham will have some further explaining to do when he returns to the club's training complex in Carrington later this week. \u0095 Manchester United's captain Roy Keane has said that he and his team-mates \"went too far\" when they chased the referee Andy d'Urso after he awarded Middlesbrough a penalty at Old Trafford 3 weeks ago. \"It won't be happening again,\" Keane said. \"I know I should have been setting a better example.\"",

      "bodyText": "A car bomb exploded this afternoon near the seat of the Basque regional government in Vitoria, Spain, killing a leading political opponent of Basque separatism and his bodyguard. The explosion occurred shortly after 4:30 pm local time on a university campus about 200 meters from the headquarters of the president of the Basque government as officials were inside holding a press conference. Spanish television showed footage of a bloodied body lying on a grassy area of the campus. Police later confirmed that the fatalities were Fernando Buesa, leader of the Alava provincial chapter of the Basque socialist party, and a policeman serving as his bodyguard. Basque separatists ETA were immediately blamed for the killing by Spanish interior minister Jaime Mayor Oreja. People in Spain and the Basque region \"must understand the macabre lesson ETA is trying to teach us,\" Mayor Oreja told reporters. ETA announced in December it was ending a 14-month-old cease-fire and warned it would resume attacks. The organization, which has killed nearly 800 people since 1968, was blamed for a car bomb blast in Madrid on January 21 in which an army colonel was killed. Although most of its victims have been security force members, in recent years ETA has begun targeting members of Spain's governing Popular Party and the leading opposition Socialist party, to which Buesa belonged. Tuesday's attack came as Spain gears up for general elections on March 12. Buesa's party opposes Basque separatism and favors instead the current system of broad Basque autonomy granted by the Spanish constitution. The regional government is controlled by the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which says it supports Basque independence but opposes ETA's violent methods. Buesa was walking near his home with his bodyguard when the bomb detonated. He was among some 10,000 people who took part in an anti-ETA demonstration on Saturday in the nearby Basque city of San Sebastian.",

But it's of no help in any contest between citizen and government over the disclosure of official information. The freedom from official secrecy is not a human right, and nor is its protection.</p> <p>All the same, it seems entirely proper to be launching a discussion under this roof about freedom of information. I am delighted to have been invited to do so. For in the government's eyes, certainly, their interest in this freedom is part of a package for which they make grand claims as constitutional reformers. The bill now going through parliament is an accompaniment to the Human Rights Act that is already law. It springs, as they would claim, from the same reformist spirit that has slaughtered the forces of conservatism in Scotland, in Wales, in the legal profession and also, we're supposed to believe, in the House of Lords. It is part of the making good of an agenda which this Institute, in broad terms, exists to support.</p> <p>In my lecture, I have no intention of discussing the broad agenda. That's the last you'll hear of Scotland. I don't propose to deal in detail with the freedom of information legislation itself, though there are parts of it - and especially of its underlying philosophy - worth drawing attention to. My intention is to go beyond the Bill, and challenge some of the axioms that have tended to limit debate - even among those who most passionately want to see a freedom of information law enacted.</p> <p>I contend that even if this Bill is passed, it will bring us nowhere near an acceptable frontier between secrecy and disclosure. Our debates, worthy though they have been - and far though they have taken things in the past two decades - are constipated by too many fixed assumptions that need to be dislodged. So tentative has the reform movement become, and so grateful is it meant to be for the offerings the Government has generously agreed to make, that we - who are part of this movement - have conceded too much of the ground that matters most: the ground at the heart of government, where the big decisions are made in secret, and where the very essence of the democratic compact is to be found. I argue that secrecy, though presented as essential to the making of good decisions, is more likely to be the accomplice of bad ones.</p> <p>The right to secrecy is claimed by all governments at all times. It is, as has often been pointed out, a matter of power. In the British case, but not only the British, the hallowed tradition is that all official information should be secret unless admitted, exceptionally, to be suitable for disclosure. There never has been a right of access to government documents. In 1605 Francis Bacon wrote: \"We see all governments as obscure and invisible\". This, he thought, was how it should be, and he proved to be a durable prophet of his country's future practices. Although invisibility became impossible with the arrival of something like a free press, obscurity - studied, conscious, dissembling obscurity - survives, as a British governing philosophy, to this day.</p> <p>Sweden enacted a Freedom of the Press Act in 1766, which continues to give citizens the right to inspect and reproduce official documents. In the United States, Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act in 1966 - strengthened in 1974 - to promote the disclosure of official information. But these are unusual cases of a voluntary recognition - one in the 18th century, the other in the 20th - that absolute official secrecy conflicted with the public interest. In sixties America, which is our main model for these things, the public right to know was asserted partly because power in Washington is dispersed. The executive branch was up against Congresses, both in '66 and '74, that did not trust it. The appetite for absolute power is nothing like so easily sustainable there as in London. All the same, this was a signal surrender. Even though the American law has been hedged around by exemptions, it does still mean it is much easier to find out about aspects of contemporary British government in Washington than in London: as my Guardian colleague, David Hencke, regularly shows.</p> <p>London, however, has not entirely failed to take an interest in more openness. People not in government have seen that more freedom of information would be a handy weapon of oppositionism. Openness, though never previously a part of the British governing culture, has been the promise of several recent opposition parties. The earliest one I can trace is in the manifesto of the 1970 Conservatives, where Ted Heath promised to eliminate \"unnecessary secrecy\" concerning the working of government. This wasn't a promise of freedom of information, merely a hint in favour of the far more paternalistic, aspirational and undemanding mantra of open government. But it had seldom been said before. There were similar vague mutterings by other oppositions during the 1970s, but no serious work was done - and nothing whatever, of course, was done about such inconsequential aspirations when the party in question got into power. For power, as I say, was what it was all about.</p> <p>The first party to carry the issue to a new level was the predecessor of the present government, the last manifestation of what we now know as Old Labour. The longer Labour stayed in opposition, the more dedicated it became to the notion that the entire culture of government had to change. Power, the nectar of which it had been deprived for so long, would finally be diluted when this period in the wilderness was over. When it supped once more from the cup, it would transfer significant amounts of public information into the public realm and create a right to know. The proof of the extent of this shift of mind-set was striking: a fully drafted Freedom of Information law, worked-over clause by clause, ready to go if Labour won the 1992 election, and grandly pledged by Neil Kinnock as the first piece of legislation he would then enact.</p> <p>Well - chance would be a fine thing! Like much else, this pledge turned to ashes when John Major won the election. But it had, for me, a significant after-life - or rather, non-life. When, much later, I was interviewing Jack Straw about the present measure for which he is the responsible minister, he showed striking ignorance of this piece of history. His excuse for the long delay in producing his freedom of information Bill was that - unlike the Human Rights Bill, for example - no work had been done on it in opposition. But, I said to him, an entire statute lay fully worked out on somebody's shelf from six or seven years ago. Mr Straw had never heard of it. Was this the amnesia of a minister schooled to forget that anything good had ever come out of Old Labour? Or the negligence of one who actually did not want to hasten the work on his own bill, despite the fact that it was a major promise made by Tony Blair?</p> <p>Before going on to take a look at what the Blair Government has done, or not done - what it should do, and does not want to do - to redefine the right to official secrecy, I should observe that secrecy is not maintained, or otherwise, only by law. It never has been sealed tight, whatever the law may say. We have lived through several governments that had no commitment to freedom of information which have nevertheless been involuntary exponents of it on a formidable scale. No government - until Mr Blair's - sought to impose itself with more absolute authority on politics than Margaret Thatcher's But no government, either, was more exposed to view. The most potent catalyst of openness is political disagreement. Under Mrs Thatcher it was the regular experience of people like me to meet a minister for lunch on Thursday whose exasperation with what had just happened in Cabinet drove him to give a blow-by-blow account, which duly appeared in next day's paper - a model exercise in informing the British people what was really going on.</p> <p>Mr Blair, however, promised something better. In March 1996, he set out not just a few cautious proposals to keep the open government lobby quiet but what sounded like a complete philosophy of openness, designed, as he put it, to change \"the relationship in politics today\". It was an almost messianic performance. Openness was the key solution to just about everything wrong with a system that was, as he said, \"about fifty, sixty, seventy years behind the actual feelings and sentiments of the broad majority of people.\" It was the cure for disaffection and disillusion. It met the aspirations of a vastly better educated people. Freedom of information, Mr Blair concluded, was the way to deliver \"not just more open but more effective and efficient government.\" I want to come back to that last phrase later: it is, I believe, the heart of the matter.</p> <p>In the beginning - those first heady six months of power - it looked as though something like this promise would be delivered. There was, of course, a battle. Whitehall soon identified its most trusted force for conservatism - the chief minister at the Home Office. But at that time, Mr Straw was ranged against a somewhat improbable radical: none other than the Lord Chancellor, who supervised the publication of a white paper which did import into government some of the perceptions gained in opposition, and in particular the sense that ministers should not be judges in their own cause on every occasion when their right to secrecy was contested. The sense that politicians were not necessarily the least self-interested upholders of the public good - already given remarkable acceptance in the apparatus of regulators and invigilators overseeing the conduct of MPs - was extended to the question of secrecy. A quasi-judicial commissioner, and not a minister, would determine the limits of the public's right to know.</p> <p>The white paper was not a perfect fulfillment of the promises, but it went much further than any British government had gone before. To watch its subsequent dismembering was to witness, in clinical detail, the evolving of the New Labour personality, from opposition idealist into governmental cynic. The spectacle could be used as a graphic case-study not just of how governments change their minds - which they're quite entitled to do when they get to grips, say, with the realities of the health service or the tax system - but of how the mind-set of ministerialism itself soon infuses everything they do: the compelling need for power, the aversion to the possibility of embarrassment, and therefore the belief that the slightest risk of these imperatives being compromised, by losing control of information, must always be avoided.</p> <p>So - the bill that is now before Parliament is a pale version of the white paper, as is, I am sure, well known to this audience.</p> <p>It is not valueless. By creating a legal framework, it goes further than the mere code of practice on openness which the Major government introduced. It does, in general, require public authorities of many kinds to make information public, and obliges them to devise schemes whereby this publication can take place. Many public bodies - from nursery schools to parks authorities, from the British Transport Police to Passenger Transport Executives, from universities to parish councils - will be living under new obligations of openness, better enabling those who want to interrogate them to acquire the data needed to do so. For low-level bodies - and perhaps even for some more important ones, like the police - the regime of accountability may become more real.</p> <p>But the measure is riddled with loopholes to protect the political power elite. Although it purports to create a right of access, it contains no clear presumption in favour of disclosure. In the many exempt categories it creates, it does require public authorities, in considering whether, exceptionally, to release information, to have regard for the possibility that the case for disclosure outweighs the case for exemption - but it does not assert that the public interest is in favour of disclosure unless there is good reason not to disclose. Nor is the Commissioner any longer empowered to override a public authority's, or minister's, decision on that matter. It remains the case, moreover, that if the already substantial barricades against disclosures that ministers do not want should turn out to be insufficient - if some crevice has been overlooked, through which some sensitive morsel might escape - a reserve power will exist for the minister, at his or her discretion, to block it by retrospective order.</p> <p>The proposals have attracted much discussion in the relatively small circles that care about these things - which do not include to any serious extent, Her Majesty's Opposition. Perhaps they have not been there long enough! Under pressure, Mr Straw has made one or two concessions. The original Bill, for example, exempted as a category any information that might end up as relevant to an accident inquiry. The chance proximity of publication of the Bill with the Paddington rail disaster made this unreasonable exemption politically impossible to sustain in all its absolute rigour: there has been a very modest relaxation. Straw has also graciously withdrawn the extraordinary requirement, in the original Bill, that any authority from whom information was being demanded had the right to ask how this was going to be used and, if it didn't want the stuff to be actually published, to withhold it. There've been other small improvements.</p> <p>At the core, however, there has been no change. The process of policy-making will still be exempt as a class of information, double-banked by further protection to be gained from contents-based exemption. Section 33 (1) exempts as a class all information on \"the formulation or development of government policy\", communications between ministers, cabinet papers, and all information related to the operation of a minister's private office. All this irrespective of any harm, still less any substantial harm, disclosure might do. Section 34 (2), as if that were not enough, creates an additional harm test, specifying information - just in case subsection 1 isn't restrictive enough - that in the opinion of the authority or ministers \"would, or would be likely to, prejudice the maintenance of collective responsibility of ministers\", or \"inhibit the free and frank provision of advice\".</p> <p><b>Continued...</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/freedom/Story/0,2763,139554,00.html\">Part two</a></p>",

If one sees the Institute, a most admirable organisation, as operating in the territory defined by the European Convention on Human Rights, neither the secrecy nor the freedom of information comes within its scope.

It may be right to have a lot more open accountability for Camden Council or the University of London - in which their decision-making processes have to be revealed. But central government is another matter.</p> <p>The objection to disclosures in this field often begins with caricature. It is couched in terms that make freedom of information sound self-evidently absurd, or patently a private rather than a public matter. \"So you want to have the Cabinet minutes published tomorrow\" is one familiar line of ridicule - designed at a stroke to dispose of the slightest possibility of publishing them within 30 years, the minimum limit for public records. Another familiar allegation is that the media, by pressing for such a regime of openness, are interested solely in serving their own purposes - as if there could not be anything except scuttlebutt and tabloid headlines to be gained from the exposure of public policy decisions being privately arrived at: either before they are made, or very soon afterwards.</p> <p>There is something in the second of these objections - in that so few parts of the media have taken a serious interest in the freedom of information debate. It is quite striking how this measure, which bears directly on the service journalism can offer the citizen, has almost become the property of one newspaper - The Guardian - and is not seen as a matter of broad and genuine public concern. One might conclude from this that the only interest most newspapers and broadcasters have is indeed in what they can pruriently extract by way of instant scandal from whatever opportunities the final Act gives them. They excuse their indifference by deriding any chatterer who takes the issue seriously as being out of touch with what the great British public cares about.</p> <p>Actually, nobody is saying that Cabinet minutes should be revealed tomorrow: and nobody with any sense would imagine that these issues are of concern only to the media. They are of serious relevance to the way government is done to all of us. And there is a serious case for a more liberal approach than virtually anyone in the political establishment is prepared to contemplate. I don't argue for instant publication of minutes. But I do contest the premise that all the best policy decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy protected for 30 years.</p> <p>Let's consider this a little further. What we're asked to believe is that both ministers and officials - approaching, say, a long-term decision about health service rationing, or an instant response to the latest twist in the beef war with France - can only function at their best and wisest if arguments they privately make and advice they privately give can be relied on to stay secret until most of them are dead, or at any rate have long retired from the public service. In respect of officials especially, there's an unexamined assumption that free and frank advice would be impossible to submit unless its secrecy - barring unofficial leaks, of course - was guaranteed. This is a very old British rule, based on two traditional ideas: first, that officials are and must remain faceless people, who do not answer to the public; and second, that if they became associated with a particular piece of advice to one government, a successor government might put the mark of Cain on them. Their famous neutrality, in short, would be blown apart.</p> <p>The case this makes against disclosure billows out more widely. Not merely the policy discussion and advice-giving must be suppressed, but also much of the factual data on which it is based. Though there is a lot of factual data in the public realm, this is by grace and favour of the government. It's seldom up to Parliament, and never imposed by law. Secrecy is the baseline, irrespective of the nature of the decision in question: the siting of a new motorway, the reform of child benefit, how to make green suburban land available to Walmart, what new aircraft to sell to Indonesia, whether to renew the British nuclear deterrent. The key preparations for all these decisions are kept secret for 30 years, partly to protect the sanctity of the civil service.</p> <p>I think this is a poor reason. It's out of date. Civil servants are far more public people than they were. Many of them are hardened by the jousting they have to do with select committees on behalf of their ministers. Of course, their ministers remain supreme. The official will never break ranks with the party line. But nor would he be punished any more than he or she is already, if it became known in due course that they advised for rather than against the Newbury bypass. Civil servants are already far less of a faceless, all purpose mandarinate than they were 30 years ago. Mrs Thatcher moved them round at will and whim, constantly searching for people who were one of us. Mr Blair does the same thing.</p> <p>The broader point about this secrecy applies to ministers as well as officials. Decisions made in private are not, by definition, the best decisions. They're quite likely to be the worst. They exclude any two-way dialogue between insiders and outsiders who might have much to contribute, for example, to the thinking about motorways - but can only do so if they're let in on all the data and discussions the Department of Transport is currently relying on. It was a very senior civil servant, and one of the old school - Robert Armstrong, formerly the secretary of the Cabinet - who once told me that, in many cases, if he knew the advice he was called on to give might soon be subject to public scrutiny, it would probably be more rigorously worked out. Lord Armstrong was, of course, an especially high-grade official. Less self-confident people would be more worried at this prospect. But what we have here is the glimmerings of an argument that most people are familiar with, but that British government has long been sheltered from adopting: that the more open your work is to scrutiny, the harder you will try to get it right.</p> <p>I know the case against this. While policy is maturing, it's said, nobody should find themselves suddenly exposed as backing an opinion that may only be contingent. There must be space for people to disagree, before the compromises are struck which everyone then gets behind. Some decisions are so sensitive - when they involve genuine matters of national security, intelligence (for example in Northern Ireland), or relations with foreign powers - that the need for secrecy has to override the democratic case for public information.</p> <p>On the other hand, even the most sensitive subjects can acquire a new perspective. I propose an example to make my point. I think it's just about perfect. Ten years ago, the holiest of all holy public information was what was quaintly known as Bank Rate. Not only were the government's interest-rate plans never discussed by ministers in public, they were outside the reach of the Cabinet - an entirely privy matter between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. It was unimaginable that interest-rate policy would be set other than in secret, and defended other than by the grand assertions of the almighty minister.</p> <p>This was changed, first, when Kenneth Clarke became Chancellor. The Ken and Eddie show began, in which Mr Clarke and Eddie George, governor of the Bank, had regular meetings to discuss interest-rates, and the minutes of their meetings were published six weeks later. This was not a complete success. The Bank's opinion was set down much more clearly than the Treasury's, and the meeting concluded with a decision by the Chancellor - of which even his officials seldom had prior notice, and which Mr Clarke, rather characteristically, did not reason out so much as bluffly assert. Elements of political caprice, which typified the old regime, remained.</p> <p>Now, that system has become more like a true, public Socratic dialogue, concluding with a decision that is drained both of secrecy and of caprice. The monthly meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee are preceded by informed public debate, in which members of the committee feel free to join. They take detailed and public soundings with representatives of every region and industry affected by their power. In place of political power, exercised in secret, we have technocrats reasoning out their decisions in public.</p> <p>Why did this happen? And what has it produced? It happened because Mr Clarke and Mr George saw that the only way to build credibility for British economic decision-making after the calamity of being forced out of the ERM was by inventing more transparency for the deliberations of the Bank and Treasury. The world needed to see that at least some economic reasoning, subject to scrutiny and challenge, lay behind the political decision. Gordon Brown took it a large stride further, by renouncing any part in the decision - but insisting that the process should be more open still. And the result? On the old model, such daring would have been universally expected to produce chaos on the markets, horrendous speculation, and the national life-blood draining away. Instead, it has no critics. Not merely the transfer of the decision, but the immediate transparency that attends its making, are just about universally agreed to have transformed the monetary context of British economic policy.</p> <p>Now - I'm not so daft as to argue from this that Cabinet committee minutes should be released a fortnight after the meetings. Though the interest-rate decision is hyper-sensitive, it is, in a sense, quite simple. It is singular, black-and-white and done on a monthly basis. Though it touches many other economic matters, the people who make it have a narrow brief, which doesn't include the whole breadth of economic policy. On the other hand, it's noticeable that the members are allowed publicly to disagree, without the house falling down or their collective decision being compromised. The advance into this fully publicised world attests to a belief in the public's greater maturity. The notion of public choices being publicly made, after informed public discussion and in the knowledge that each participant's contribution will become public property, sets an instructive precedent. It expresses a philosophy which could usefully be spread wider. This would lead to greater public understanding of the choices ministers face and - I believe - better ways of making them.</p> <p>I'd like briefly to put up two suggestions.</p> <p>First, as regards current policy-making, there really is no excuse - beyond a combination of idleness and control-freakery - for retaining in the realm of non-disclosure the factual and data-based material on which ministers are going to rest their difficult decision.</p> <p>Statistics. Technical and scientific advice. The submissions of lobbyists. Descriptions of existing practices, and past advice, of departments. Assessments of previous failures. Even the official analysis of data relating to the policy decision that has to be taken. You can see how much this might stimulate inconvenient challenges from expert outsiders - whether on new motorways, or nuclear power, or rural subsidies, or the independence of general practitioners, or whatever is the issue of the moment But it also stands to reason that such an open process would diminish the opportunities for private deals and short-term political priorities to fly in the face of some longer-term public interest.</p> <p>Personally, I would go further. I see no reason - beyond preserving the myth of government as the making of a single obvious choice on which all reasonable persons must agree - not to be more open about the difficulty of those choices. I agree with Lord Burns - formerly Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury - who told the Commons committee which took evidence on freedom of information, that there was \"an enormous amount to be gained in exposing on a lot of difficult policy issues that there often is quite a fine line between the options that are concerned'. I think educating people very often about the complexity of these discussions and the fact that they are finely balanced does a service to the political process rather than damage.\"</p> <p>That may be asking too much. And, in any case, it is not always to easy to separate the factual basis of policy and the advice that derives from it. Jack Straw has used this as an argument against making a formal distinction in law between them. So - along with other blanket exclusions, of dubious relevance, like commercial confidentiality - it is easier to exclude the whole of policy-making than to make a serious effort to improve public knowledge, and the quality of the decision that might result, by imposing a duty to disclose the factual basis for decisions. This is surely one area - the setting of the borderline between what is a factual analysis and what is policy advice - better left to the Commissioner than the ministers. However much they neuter the Commissioner on other matters, in this respect at least - if they remember anything of Mr Blair's early promises - ministers should surrender their own judgement to hers. That is, of course, a big if. It might impose the beginnings of a presumption, where data were intermingled with advice, that disclosure was, all the same, more in the public interest than non-disclosure.</p> <p>Nearly 20 years ago, interestingly enough, a permanent secretary who had just retired from the Treasury, Sir Douglas Wass, proposed something very similar. It was his belief, he said, that the number of government documents that needed to be published in order ensure an open democracy was quite small. But they were significant. Why not, he said, have \"an expert and independent presence\" in each department, identifying the important policy material of a factual and analytical kind. What Sir Douglas proposed in 1984 has so far been unthinkable to a reforming government in 2000.</p> <p>But there's another way we could get away from the caricature, while taking seriously that original promise. This is my second suggestion: amend the Public Records Act, and reduce the 30-year rule to a more realistic level. I would say five years, for most classes of information, is quite enough.</p> <p>Here is a real opportunity to give meaning to the notion of accountability. Without infringing on the desire for secrecy while decisions are being made, such a rule would acknowledge that open accountability for advice and decision-making is better transacted in the forum than the museum.</p> <p>It would come as a terrible shock to the governing classes. It must be so wonderfully comforting to know that your follies, and duplicities, as well as your better moments, will be preserved from sight for pretty much the rest of your natural life. Yet I contend that this arrangement actually has little to do with the public interest, much more with the career-interest of the individuals concerned.</p> <p>I can see that a quarantine period is necessary. But the genuine sensitivity of decisions often has a short shelf-life. It no longer matters to good government that the full history of the BSE scandal should not be investigated and reported - which is why the Phillips Inquiry was launched. Quite the opposite. Only by such an investigation can we learn a few lessons. But I'd make the point more widely - as they do, for example, in Ireland, where a five-year rule on public records operates. Knowing that your advice and arguments will become public property in five years will tend to improve not diminish their quality. And in the Irish case, we have it on the Taoiseach's own authority that their more liberal regime of public information generally has had no bad impact on the way notes are taken, records kept etc.</p> <p>Again, I hear bureaucratic objections. It was once vaguely proposed by the present government that the 30-year rule should be reduced to 20 years. But the idea foundered on the classic Whitehall obstacle: shortage of manpower and resources. Suddenly catching up on the extra years - weeding the files, and arranging them for public access - was deemed too large a task. The 20-year reform seems to have faded away. My proposal is different. I don't suggest that a five-year rule should be retrospective. That wouldn't be fair on ministers and civil servants who were operating on different expectations. But a new rule which said that public records accumulated after January 1 2001 would be released five years later would have, I believe, a bracing and therapeutic effect on the way government is done and understood in this country.</p> <p>The leitmotif of this Government's performance in the field of information has not, alas, been openness. Still less has it been freedom. The key word - a word just about invented in the Blairite firmament, and now inextricably associated with it - has been \"spinning\". Instead of freedom of information, we've learned about the spinning of the truth. In the world of spinning, we get dizzy. There are not enough anchors of fact. When you come to think of it, spinning could not have become the hallmark of Blairism without the right to secrecy being put to service as its handmaiden.</p> <p>There is a kind of precedent for a five-year rule. An earlier Labour Government turned out to contain three Cabinet ministers who kept diaries. The first of these was Richard Crossman, and when the Crossman Diaries were about to be published, less than a decade after the events they covered, the next Labour government went to great lengths to try and stop them. The courts found against the government, and Barbara Castle and Tony Benn walked through the gap Crossman had created. All kinds of mayhem were predicted as a result. The very ark of the Cabinet covenant had been breached. Civil servants exposed to ridicule. Furious ministerial disagreements giving the lie to collective responsibility. There were great men, led by the Cabinet Secretary of the day, who thought that the quality of British government would never recover from this opening of the secret doors.</p> <p>Nothing of the kind occurred. All that happened was a minor exercise in public education, disabusing people of some of the absurd and pernicious fictions about how they were governed. Maybe it didn't make them think better of politicians, but it helped them understand the truth.</p> <p>It also put future politicians on their mettle. That's what an assumption of disclosure does. If we had a five-year rule, the public would understand that ministers did, after all, want to create a whole new regime of information. They might not be able to face the consequences, for their policies and reputations in the here and now, of surrendering power in the way they promised in Opposition. But they would show they were willing to increase transparency quite soon after the state interest, as distinct from their own, had ceased to be sensitive: that the right to secrecy, adjudicated entirely by themselves, has ceased to serve this country well.</p> <p>They would not be fulfilling pre-97 Tony Blair to the letter. But they would recognise what Lord Acton, who knew quite a lot about power, said 100 years ago. \"Everything secret degenerates, even the administration of justice.

      "bodyText": "In other words, here, at the heart of government, there is to be no reform. And this, in the conservative British way, is generally accepted as reasonable. It may be right to have a lot more open accountability for Camden Council or the University of London - in which their decision-making processes have to be revealed. But central government is another matter. The objection to disclosures in this field often begins with caricature. It is couched in terms that make freedom of information sound self-evidently absurd, or patently a private rather than a public matter. \"So you want to have the Cabinet minutes published tomorrow\" is one familiar line of ridicule - designed at a stroke to dispose of the slightest possibility of publishing them within 30 years, the minimum limit for public records. Another familiar allegation is that the media, by pressing for such a regime of openness, are interested solely in serving their own purposes - as if there could not be anything except scuttlebutt and tabloid headlines to be gained from the exposure of public policy decisions being privately arrived at: either before they are made, or very soon afterwards. There is something in the second of these objections - in that so few parts of the media have taken a serious interest in the freedom of information debate. It is quite striking how this measure, which bears directly on the service journalism can offer the citizen, has almost become the property of one newspaper - The Guardian - and is not seen as a matter of broad and genuine public concern. One might conclude from this that the only interest most newspapers and broadcasters have is indeed in what they can pruriently extract by way of instant scandal from whatever opportunities the final Act gives them. They excuse their indifference by deriding any chatterer who takes the issue seriously as being out of touch with what the great British public cares about. Actually, nobody is saying that Cabinet minutes should be revealed tomorrow: and nobody with any sense would imagine that these issues are of concern only to the media. They are of serious relevance to the way government is done to all of us. And there is a serious case for a more liberal approach than virtually anyone in the political establishment is prepared to contemplate. I don't argue for instant publication of minutes. But I do contest the premise that all the best policy decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy protected for 30 years. Let's consider this a little further. What we're asked to believe is that both ministers and officials - approaching, say, a long-term decision about health service rationing, or an instant response to the latest twist in the beef war with France - can only function at their best and wisest if arguments they privately make and advice they privately give can be relied on to stay secret until most of them are dead, or at any rate have long retired from the public service. In respect of officials especially, there's an unexamined assumption that free and frank advice would be impossible to submit unless its secrecy - barring unofficial leaks, of course - was guaranteed. This is a very old British rule, based on two traditional ideas: first, that officials are and must remain faceless people, who do not answer to the public; and second, that if they became associated with a particular piece of advice to one government, a successor government might put the mark of Cain on them. Their famous neutrality, in short, would be blown apart. The case this makes against disclosure billows out more widely. Not merely the policy discussion and advice-giving must be suppressed, but also much of the factual data on which it is based. Though there is a lot of factual data in the public realm, this is by grace and favour of the government. It's seldom up to Parliament, and never imposed by law. Secrecy is the baseline, irrespective of the nature of the decision in question: the siting of a new motorway, the reform of child benefit, how to make green suburban land available to Walmart, what new aircraft to sell to Indonesia, whether to renew the British nuclear deterrent. The key preparations for all these decisions are kept secret for 30 years, partly to protect the sanctity of the civil service. I think this is a poor reason. It's out of date. Civil servants are far more public people than they were. Many of them are hardened by the jousting they have to do with select committees on behalf of their ministers. Of course, their ministers remain supreme. The official will never break ranks with the party line. But nor would he be punished any more than he or she is already, if it became known in due course that they advised for rather than against the Newbury bypass. Civil servants are already far less of a faceless, all purpose mandarinate than they were 30 years ago. Mrs Thatcher moved them round at will and whim, constantly searching for people who were one of us. Mr Blair does the same thing. The broader point about this secrecy applies to ministers as well as officials. Decisions made in private are not, by definition, the best decisions. They're quite likely to be the worst. They exclude any two-way dialogue between insiders and outsiders who might have much to contribute, for example, to the thinking about motorways - but can only do so if they're let in on all the data and discussions the Department of Transport is currently relying on. It was a very senior civil servant, and one of the old school - Robert Armstrong, formerly the secretary of the Cabinet - who once told me that, in many cases, if he knew the advice he was called on to give might soon be subject to public scrutiny, it would probably be more rigorously worked out.

But what we have here is the glimmerings of an argument that most people are familiar with, but that British government has long been sheltered from adopting: that the more open your work is to scrutiny, the harder you will try to get it right. I know the case against this. While policy is maturing, it's said, nobody should find themselves suddenly exposed as backing an opinion that may only be contingent. There must be space for people to disagree, before the compromises are struck which everyone then gets behind. Some decisions are so sensitive - when they involve genuine matters of national security, intelligence (for example in Northern Ireland), or relations with foreign powers - that the need for secrecy has to override the democratic case for public information. On the other hand, even the most sensitive subjects can acquire a new perspective. I propose an example to make my point. I think it's just about perfect. Ten years ago, the holiest of all holy public information was what was quaintly known as Bank Rate. Not only were the government's interest-rate plans never discussed by ministers in public, they were outside the reach of the Cabinet - an entirely privy matter between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. It was unimaginable that interest-rate policy would be set other than in secret, and defended other than by the grand assertions of the almighty minister. This was changed, first, when Kenneth Clarke became Chancellor. The Ken and Eddie show began, in which Mr Clarke and Eddie George, governor of the Bank, had regular meetings to discuss interest-rates, and the minutes of their meetings were published six weeks later. This was not a complete success.

They have reached deep into their hearts and taken back their government. Friday 18 February 2000 represents another real turning point in Iran's political history, like May 23 1997, when people brought their popular president to office. Indeed, democracy has finally arrived. Dokhi Fassihian, The Iranian People want change The people indicated that they want certain changes resulting in a better life and prosperity by mostly opting for the reformist candidates. In short, the Friday election signalled the outset of a new era in Iran characterised by a better domestic situation as well as improved relations with the outside world. Teheran Times In Israel Election should pave way to rapprochement with US The United States wants to return to Iran just as much as Iran wants to return to America's banks. Iran's new parliament, if the election results so far indicate what it will look like, has admittedly removed several major obstacles on the road to a conciliation between the two countries; the pace of progress along that road, however, will be determined by Khatami, in accordance with the latitude that he and the nation's supreme religious leader will agree upon. Zvi Bar'el, Ha'aretz In the US Iran still a danger It is not yet time for a softening of sanctions. A more politically open Iran will not necessarily become less of an international menace; ending state-sponsored terrorism does not appear high on the priority list of reformers, who are preoccupied with domestic projects. Though signs of an Iranian opening are sure to quicken the rush of European businesses to Teheran, the \"soft\" diplomacy and cultural exchanges of current US policy are more appropriate as Iran's struggle proceeds.

      "body": "<p>Effortlessly and silently, Henry's bed slid down the empty, sterile corridors towards the operating centre. There wasn't another living soul in this sector of the building, but still the sensors in the walls and ceiling bleeped quietly as he passed, checking his bacterial levels, ready to trigger the elimination of any organisms he might cough up and leave in his wake. </p> <p>Henry himself, of course, was unaware of his solitary journey, no sympathetic nurse to hold his hand or flash him a reassuring smile. </p> <p>The robotic bed in room 119 had received the computerised instruction to take Henry to surgery around 3am, while the patient was in a deep sleep. It had administered a sedative intravenously through the tube in his arm and was monitoring his state of consciousness, as well as the habitual heartbeat, pulse and blood pressure checks. If Henry began to surface, the dosage would increase automatically. </p> <p>The bed neatly docked in the operating centre, locking itself into the floor in the middle of the room and adjusting its height and angle for the video monitors. Two hundred miles away, Frost, the anaesthetist, swivelled in his chair, took a swig of coffee and a last glance at the bowel operation he had been monitoring and turned his attention to Henry's heart-rate. </p> <p>Frost put on a pair of glasses which projected Henry's patient notes above the prostrate and unconscious form he could see on his screen. He frowned. </p> <p>This man was 60 - now regarded as middle age. He had spent a dissolute youth by the standards of the mid-21st century. Had he - and the medical authorities - known from birth that he had a gene predictive of heart disease, he would never have been allowed to gorge himself on a high-fat animal protein diet in his youth. His fridge would have been programmed not to order up the butter he used to lavishly spread on his toast. He would have aerobic machines installed in his home. These days a young man with such genes knew that no employer would look at him without a high-grade daily exercise certificate. And this man used to smoke! Of course, he was forced to give up when cigarettes were finally banned 10 years ago but, to judge from the state of his arteries, he had probably been buying them on the black market. </p> <p>Similar thoughts were running through the head of the surgeon on the other side of the world, but Jenner was in a happier frame of mind. It was not so often that he had an opportunity to exercise his judgment any more, with the hugely improved health of the western world's population. Surgical skills - the speed and agility that used to be crucial to the success of an operation - were a thing of the past. Surgery had ceased to be hands-on. </p> <p>At his control screen, he checked that Frost had finished anaesthetising Henry, and began to instruct the robotic arms in the operating centre far away in their task. There would be no opening of the chest - those days were long gone - just a tiny incision to allow in the microscopically small instruments and minute cameras that would do the work. Henry would be up and about again in a few days. </p> <p>Almost all of the scenario described is possible already. Dr Charles Wilson, from the Institute for the Future and the department of neurosurgery at the University of California in San Francisco - a man, in fact, licensed to work out ways of making the extraordinary happen - says the intelligent bed is already with us and the robotic, sensor-filled hospital is on the drawing board. And it's most likely to happen in California first. </p> <p>\"Entirely because of the seismic regulations in California, many of the hospitals will have to be either substantially changed or replaced, so there's an opportunity in California to look to the future in building hospitals,\" he says. </p> <p>So they are thinking in radical terms - where can you do it if not in California, which has good geological reasons for discarding the \"social, economic and religious trappings\", as he put it, that cause people to put up such a fight against hospital closures? \"The hospitals are becoming smaller for the same patient population and the patient population is becoming more acute,\" says Wilson. \"All the rooms can be instantly converted into ICUs [intensive care units]. It makes sense. </p> <p>\"Patients go to ICUs so they can be monitored and have someone constantly looking at their blood pressure and so on. If these things can be done by sensors, they could be put in any bed and there would not be a need for a centralised ICU where patients can get cross-infections.\" </p> <p>And so to that bed. The US army has been using it for some time. It was designed for field hospitals - a bed that can be used as a trolley and a stretcher and a life support system, incorporating all kinds of monitors. </p> <p>The rapid advances in robotics and sensors will allow ever more sophisticated versions to be developed for hospitals. Once the patient is fixed up with drips, masks, suction tubes and whatever else, computers can control and monitor breathing, pulse, blood pressure, drug doses and the rest. There will be no need for a nurse at the bedside. Henry and half a dozen others can be monitored in their private rooms from a central control panel, perhaps within the hospital but equally possibly hundreds of miles away. Telemedicine is already here. </p> <p>Better health all round will mean fewer people with more serious problems - and those who need treatment outside the home will probably visit a specialist heart, lung or brain hospital. It is now widely accepted that the busiest surgeons, who perform the same operations again and again, are the best at them. </p> <p>\"There's a hernia hospital in the United States that does nothing else, but does it better than anywhere else in the world,\" says Wilson. </p> <p>The future of medicine holds amazing developments, such as the growing of human organs. Wilson envisages hospitals with \"a whole menu of solid organs and tissues and cells\", some of which may come from specially bred animals, like the genetically modified pigs produced in Cambridge in Britain. </p> <p>One of the reasons we will not need the massive, all-purpose gen eral hospitals of today, where you can get a splint for a broken leg, antibiotics for meningitis or have a brain tumour extracted, is that people are not going to get into so many serious health crises in time to come. Diabetics will be fitted with a smart glucose sensor which can detect glucose levels through the skin without the need to draw blood - the prototypes already exist. People with HIV could be fitted with a viral-load sensor in the same way. Both sensors would be integrated with reservoirs implanted under the skin containing medication, so that any problems can be managed instantly. High blood pressure and irritable bowel syndrome could be treated in a similar way. </p> <p>But the biggest revolution will flow from the decoding of the human genome. Medical treatment in the next century will move from diagnosis and treatment to prediction and prevention. Each of us will be in possession of a gene chip - our own personal DNA code. Every doctor's surgery will have sophisticated software that can read it. From birth, we will know our inheritance - the likelihood of heart disease or certain cancers. We will know what to do to minimise the risk. The downside is that the information could become available to employers and insurance companies. On the upside, our doctors - or rather their computers - will know what doses of which drugs will be most effective in the event that we do get sick. How well any medicine works on an individual will depend on his or her genes. </p> <p>It is a brave new world that has such healthy people in it.

      "bodyText": "Effortlessly and silently, Henry's bed slid down the empty, sterile corridors towards the operating centre. There wasn't another living soul in this sector of the building, but still the sensors in the walls and ceiling bleeped quietly as he passed, checking his bacterial levels, ready to trigger the elimination of any organisms he might cough up and leave in his wake. Henry himself, of course, was unaware of his solitary journey, no sympathetic nurse to hold his hand or flash him a reassuring smile. The robotic bed in room 119 had received the computerised instruction to take Henry to surgery around 3am, while the patient was in a deep sleep. It had administered a sedative intravenously through the tube in his arm and was monitoring his state of consciousness, as well as the habitual heartbeat, pulse and blood pressure checks. If Henry began to surface, the dosage would increase automatically. The bed neatly docked in the operating centre, locking itself into the floor in the middle of the room and adjusting its height and angle for the video monitors. Two hundred miles away, Frost, the anaesthetist, swivelled in his chair, took a swig of coffee and a last glance at the bowel operation he had been monitoring and turned his attention to Henry's heart-rate. Frost put on a pair of glasses which projected Henry's patient notes above the prostrate and unconscious form he could see on his screen. He frowned. This man was 60 - now regarded as middle age. He had spent a dissolute youth by the standards of the mid-21st century. Had he - and the medical authorities - known from birth that he had a gene predictive of heart disease, he would never have been allowed to gorge himself on a high-fat animal protein diet in his youth. His fridge would have been programmed not to order up the butter he used to lavishly spread on his toast. He would have aerobic machines installed in his home. These days a young man with such genes knew that no employer would look at him without a high-grade daily exercise certificate. And this man used to smoke! Of course, he was forced to give up when cigarettes were finally banned 10 years ago but, to judge from the state of his arteries, he had probably been buying them on the black market. Similar thoughts were running through the head of the surgeon on the other side of the world, but Jenner was in a happier frame of mind. It was not so often that he had an opportunity to exercise his judgment any more, with the hugely improved health of the western world's population. Surgical skills - the speed and agility that used to be crucial to the success of an operation - were a thing of the past. Surgery had ceased to be hands-on. At his control screen, he checked that Frost had finished anaesthetising Henry, and began to instruct the robotic arms in the operating centre far away in their task. There would be no opening of the chest - those days were long gone - just a tiny incision to allow in the microscopically small instruments and minute cameras that would do the work. Henry would be up and about again in a few days. Almost all of the scenario described is possible already. Dr Charles Wilson, from the Institute for the Future and the department of neurosurgery at the University of California in San Francisco - a man, in fact, licensed to work out ways of making the extraordinary happen - says the intelligent bed is already with us and the robotic, sensor-filled hospital is on the drawing board. And it's most likely to happen in California first. \"Entirely because of the seismic regulations in California, many of the hospitals will have to be either substantially changed or replaced, so there's an opportunity in California to look to the future in building hospitals,\" he says. So they are thinking in radical terms - where can you do it if not in California, which has good geological reasons for discarding the \"social, economic and religious trappings\", as he put it, that cause people to put up such a fight against hospital closures? \"The hospitals are becoming smaller for the same patient population and the patient population is becoming more acute,\" says Wilson. \"All the rooms can be instantly converted into ICUs [intensive care units]. It makes sense. \"Patients go to ICUs so they can be monitored and have someone constantly looking at their blood pressure and so on. If these things can be done by sensors, they could be put in any bed and there would not be a need for a centralised ICU where patients can get cross-infections.\" And so to that bed. The US army has been using it for some time. It was designed for field hospitals - a bed that can be used as a trolley and a stretcher and a life support system, incorporating all kinds of monitors. The rapid advances in robotics and sensors will allow ever more sophisticated versions to be developed for hospitals. Once the patient is fixed up with drips, masks, suction tubes and whatever else, computers can control and monitor breathing, pulse, blood pressure, drug doses and the rest. There will be no need for a nurse at the bedside. Henry and half a dozen others can be monitored in their private rooms from a central control panel, perhaps within the hospital but equally possibly hundreds of miles away. Telemedicine is already here. Better health all round will mean fewer people with more serious problems - and those who need treatment outside the home will probably visit a specialist heart, lung or brain hospital. It is now widely accepted that the busiest surgeons, who perform the same operations again and again, are the best at them. \"There's a hernia hospital in the United States that does nothing else, but does it better than anywhere else in the world,\" says Wilson. The future of medicine holds amazing developments, such as the growing of human organs. Wilson envisages hospitals with \"a whole menu of solid organs and tissues and cells\", some of which may come from specially bred animals, like the genetically modified pigs produced in Cambridge in Britain. One of the reasons we will not need the massive, all-purpose gen eral hospitals of today, where you can get a splint for a broken leg, antibiotics for meningitis or have a brain tumour extracted, is that people are not going to get into so many serious health crises in time to come. Diabetics will be fitted with a smart glucose sensor which can detect glucose levels through the skin without the need to draw blood - the prototypes already exist. People with HIV could be fitted with a viral-load sensor in the same way. Both sensors would be integrated with reservoirs implanted under the skin containing medication, so that any problems can be managed instantly. High blood pressure and irritable bowel syndrome could be treated in a similar way. But the biggest revolution will flow from the decoding of the human genome. Medical treatment in the next century will move from diagnosis and treatment to prediction and prevention. Each of us will be in possession of a gene chip - our own personal DNA code. Every doctor's surgery will have sophisticated software that can read it. From birth, we will know our inheritance - the likelihood of heart disease or certain cancers. We will know what to do to minimise the risk. The downside is that the information could become available to employers and insurance companies. On the upside, our doctors - or rather their computers - will know what doses of which drugs will be most effective in the event that we do get sick. How well any medicine works on an individual will depend on his or her genes. It is a brave new world that has such healthy people in it. But how far into the next millennium will we be before the poorest of the world's people get even a taste of any of this? The enormous expense means it will be available for a considerable time only to the rich with private medical insurance in the right parts of the US. As Wilson says: \"The future is always among us. It is not well distributed or diffused.\" But the doctor predicts that, however slowly in some places, this kind of hi-tech medicine will become the norm. \"My guess is that it will come faster than you might think.\" The reason for that is public demand. If this futuristic technology will save and prolong lives, it is going to be difficult for the politicians to think of a money-saving argument.",

The comedian and film director admitted this week that he had developed a drug habit that left him exhausted, depressed and with two leaking stomach ulcers through which he lost dangerous levels of blood. His drug of choice was not cocaine (although he has \"dabbled\" with that) or even tranquilisers - but Nurofen Plus. </p> <p>The agonising gout that prompted Smith to take up to 50 tablets a day was far from funny, but there is something grotesquely comical about him sneaking around his house attempting to conceal packets of painkillers from his wife. \"Like the alcoholic hiding his bottles, I started hiding my Nurofen,\" he says. \"It was terribly grubby.\" </p> <p>David Grieve from Dumfries would not see the funny side either. He developed a 17-year addiction to the cough medicine Phensydyl, supporting a 90-bottle-a-week habit with a level of subterfuge that would impress the most cunning heroin user. Three days a week he set off on \"trawling trips\", travelling to pharmacies as far away as Manchester to avoid detection. The former policeman and psychiatric nurse would even impersonate a priest so that he could pass off his bulk buys as mercy missions for sick parishioners. In 24 months he spent \u00a318,000 on his habit. \"I loved my addiction more than I loved my wife or my family,\" says the 49-year-old. He kicked his habit in 1993 but is still unable to work having had his gall bladder, part of his liver and part of his pancreas removed as a result of the addiction. </p> <p>There are no official statistics for the number of people addicted to over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, but Grieve estimates that there are 35,000 addicts throughout the UK. He now runs a self-help group called Over-Count for recovering OTC addicts, and has 8,000 people on his books, two thirds of whom are women. A survey for the consumer magazine Health Which? last year found that one in 10 of us pops a pill every day, while one in five women and one in eight men take medicinal drugs twice a week or more. </p> <p>Mel Smith's dependence, like Grieve's, was probably due to codeine, an opiate derivative found in small quantities in the drug. \"It is a very effective painkiller,\" says Dr Hamid Ghodse, professor of psychiatry and addictive behaviour at St George's hospital medical school in London. \"But the side-effect of codeine, like heroin or morphine, is addiction and dependence.\" </p> <p>Ghodse believes the peculiar set of circumstances that lead to an individual becoming dependent on an OTC medicine are more complicated than straightforward physical addiction. \"Vulnerable people can become addicted because of their make-up, in particular if they have problems, mental or social,\" he says. \"For most painkillers the question of psychological and physical dependence is very much inter-related.\" </p> <p>Roger Odd, head of professional and scientific support at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, agrees, stressing that misuse of OTC drugs is much more common than simple addiction. Laxatives, he stresses, are commonly misused by anorexics, even though there is no \"addictive\" quality in the drug. Nasal sprays, similarly, are not addictive in the sense that they prompt withdrawal symptoms if the treatment is stopped. Misusers simply come to like the pleasant sensation given by the propellant. </p> <p>\"All of these products if they are used appropriately are perfectly all right,\" he stresses. \"There are no problems from a dependency point of view with aspirin, ibuprofen or paracetamol. You shouldn't, of course, take paracetamol in large doses as you can get irreversible and sometimes fatal liver damage, and aspirin is very acidic, which can cause stomach problems.\" </p> <p>Grieve is trying to persuade pharmaceuticals companies to fund research into OTC addiction, but says that, so far, approaches to 160 companies have been met with closed doors. Last month he was approached by the head of the Alabama poisons bureau, who had been unable to find information about the problem elsewhere. \"Five years ago I set up Over-Count with 25 clients. We are now growing at a rate of 1,500 clients a year. But the problem has never been officially established. You have to ask yourself why.\"</p>",

It was a lot like a butcher's cleaver hacking through a carcass, but somehow more succulent - like a ripe watermelon being split in half. </p> <p>For several days afterwards I was in shock, and flashbacks made me sob with nausea. Of course, it could have been worse, I thought - being devoured by hyenas, say, or having an arm ripped off by a threshing machine. But the sound of muscle and bone tearing apart is still pretty good at hammering home what we all know, but rarely fully appreciate - how life can change for ever, or even end, in a split second. </p> <p>It was the end of the last day of a skiing holiday in Andorra, and we were coming down an easy blue run I'd negotiated dozens of times before. I don't really know how or why I fell because everything happened so quickly. All I can remember is flip ping over and landing heavily on the back of my neck, my legs and skis crashing down on top of me with incredible force. </p> <p>The pain was so intense that I could hardly breathe, and I just kept gasping: \"Oh my God! I've broken my back!\" over and over again in a strange kind of strangled shriek which didn't sound like me. </p> <p>My first thought was of the only person I had ever met with a broken spine - a grey-faced, stick-like orphan called Moise who was slowly starving to death in a Romanian hospital. After years of lying in bed, paralysed and almost untreated, gaping bedsores had eaten away both his buttocks right to the bone. His body was using up all the energy it had in a hopeless attempt to heal them. </p> <p>Although I could still move my toes, I was terrified that I might be paralysed if anyone tried to move me. Through my trendy ski shades, which had remained smugly intact, I watched the ashen faces of the other people in my group as they erected a fence of crossed skis around me, covered me in jackets, and lamely tried to convince me I'd probably only slipped a disc. </p> <p>After what seemed like hours, the rescue team arrived to truss me up on their bright orange inflatable sledge and drag me away humiliatingly slowly below the chairlifts, full of skiers craning their necks to gawp at the casualty. </p> <p>No one has ever accused me of outlandish optimism, but my life truly did seem shattered. My boyfriend and I had been planning to move abroad within a few weeks, but now all I could see stretching ahead of me was, at best, months of orthopaedic beds, wheelchairs and physiotherapists. </p> <p>In hospital, X-rays showed a compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra, which is just below the ribs. Vertebrae are spongy bones and tend to squash rather than actually breaking. Mine had been crushed to around 70 per cent of its original height which meant that I might end up shorter. </p> <p>More seriously, the top of the bone had also sheared off extremely close to the spinal cord - so I was amazed when I was told I could make a full recovery within 12 weeks. The break was stable, meaning it would not suddenly move and sever the cord, but the doctors stressed how lucky I had been. As one of them put it: \"Broken bone is razor sharp, and the spinal cord is like a piece of spaghetti.\" </p> <p>The difference between stable and unstable fractures can be devastating, as illustrated by the cases of Bert Trautmann, the Manchester City goalie, and ex-Superman actor Christopher Reeve. Both broke their necks, but while Trautmann managed to play on to the end of an FA Cup final, Reeve was left a quadriplegic. </p> <p>Wobbling, unstable fractures are relatively uncommon, but any slight movement, such as turning in bed, can cause neural damage to parts of the body below the break. Before the days of surgically fixing these fractures, patients had to lie absolutely motionless for up to three months waiting for the bone to heal. </p> <p>Despite my good prognosis, I had to be kept under observation for a few days as spinal injuries can also cause serious paralysis of the digestive tract and urinary system. </p> <p>I found something perversely liberating in being forced to relinquish control over my life - which was now reduced to staring at the ceiling, watching atrocious Spanish TV game shows, being washed, fed plates of quivering hospital mush, and injected with painkillers and blood-thinning drugs to prevent the formation of clots. The insomnia I had suffered for months disappeared overnight, and every time my boyfriend appeared he was pleasingly laden with truffles, CDs and perfume. </p> <p>I was not allowed to move without a back brace to support my spine. The Spanish doctors called this a corset, so I imagined a kind of metallic insect exoskeleton styled by Agent Provocateur. The disappointing reality was a frame of deeply naff, and incredibly uncomfortable, white reinforced plastic. </p> <p>Once it was fitted, I gingerly tried to stand up. As I'd also torn a ligament in my knee, this was pretty agonising. Being unable to bend either my leg or back gave me the gait of a giraffe at a watering hole - but even so, it seemed nothing short of a miracle to be walking around only a few days after breaking my back. </p> <p>I was flown back to the UK and transported by ambulance to my parents' home (thank God for insurance), where sleeping on lumpy Victorian mattresses drove me almost insane with agony. An ill-advised sneeze made me sure I'd rebroken the bone, and the strongest prescription painkillers had no effect. My mother dosed me with Dr Bach's res cue remedy, cod liver oil, pineapple juice (supposedly containing an enzyme to help mend broken bone), hot milk, and even enlisted a faith healer to try to heal me from afar. </p> <p>At Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where I was sent to a fracture clinic, I was surprised to learn that out of the 2,300 or so fractures treated each year, only about 10 are broken backs. Most of these are due to falls from a height, car accidents, rugby or osteoporosis, which can often be caused by steroid treatment. </p> <p>Dr Maher Halawa, a senior orthopaedic consultant surgeon, says: \"It's actually surprisingly difficult to break the back, because it's so well supported by muscles. </p> <p>\"The number of cases has also fallen over the years due to the increased use of seat belts in cars, hormone replacement therapy, and improved psychiatric counselling. Less people are now trying to commit suicide by jumping off tall buildings.\" </p> <p>While a broken back can occasionally be devastating, Dr Halawa says a stable fracture is actually much less problematic than some breaks in other parts of the body, such as the neck or the femur. This has a poor blood supply, can take six months to mend, and carries a serious risk of blood clotting. </p> <p>With my bravery so roundly pooh-poohed, the pain slowly deteriorated within a week to nothing more than a mild ache, punctuated by the occasional worrying crunch. Now I must just lie down as much as possible for the next month or so - and am left suffering from nothing more than tedium. I would never have believed it, but there really is a limited appeal to lying around eating chocolate biscuits and reading magazines. </p> <p>A broken back is a strange thing. It sounds dangerous, and definitely has more kudos than piles or an ingrowing toenail. But after all the drama and dark fears, I now find myself suffering probably less discomfort than people with either of these less glamorous conditions. It makes me feel a bit of a fraud - but a very lucky fraud.</p>",

Wobbling, unstable fractures are relatively uncommon, but any slight movement, such as turning in bed, can cause neural damage to parts of the body below the break. Before the days of surgically fixing these fractures, patients had to lie absolutely motionless for up to three months waiting for the bone to heal. Despite my good prognosis, I had to be kept under observation for a few days as spinal injuries can also cause serious paralysis of the digestive tract and urinary system. I found something perversely liberating in being forced to relinquish control over my life - which was now reduced to staring at the ceiling, watching atrocious Spanish TV game shows, being washed, fed plates of quivering hospital mush, and injected with painkillers and blood-thinning drugs to prevent the formation of clots. The insomnia I had suffered for months disappeared overnight, and every time my boyfriend appeared he was pleasingly laden with truffles, CDs and perfume. I was not allowed to move without a back brace to support my spine. The Spanish doctors called this a corset, so I imagined a kind of metallic insect exoskeleton styled by Agent Provocateur. The disappointing reality was a frame of deeply naff, and incredibly uncomfortable, white reinforced plastic. Once it was fitted, I gingerly tried to stand up. As I'd also torn a ligament in my knee, this was pretty agonising. Being unable to bend either my leg or back gave me the gait of a giraffe at a watering hole - but even so, it seemed nothing short of a miracle to be walking around only a few days after breaking my back. I was flown back to the UK and transported by ambulance to my parents' home (thank God for insurance), where sleeping on lumpy Victorian mattresses drove me almost insane with agony. An ill-advised sneeze made me sure I'd rebroken the bone, and the strongest prescription painkillers had no effect. My mother dosed me with Dr Bach's res cue remedy, cod liver oil, pineapple juice (supposedly containing an enzyme to help mend broken bone), hot milk, and even enlisted a faith healer to try to heal me from afar. At Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where I was sent to a fracture clinic, I was surprised to learn that out of the 2,300 or so fractures treated each year, only about 10 are broken backs. Most of these are due to falls from a height, car accidents, rugby or osteoporosis, which can often be caused by steroid treatment. Dr Maher Halawa, a senior orthopaedic consultant surgeon, says: \"It's actually surprisingly difficult to break the back, because it's so well supported by muscles. \"The number of cases has also fallen over the years due to the increased use of seat belts in cars, hormone replacement therapy, and improved psychiatric counselling. Less people are now trying to commit suicide by jumping off tall buildings.\" While a broken back can occasionally be devastating, Dr Halawa says a stable fracture is actually much less problematic than some breaks in other parts of the body, such as the neck or the femur. This has a poor blood supply, can take six months to mend, and carries a serious risk of blood clotting. With my bravery so roundly pooh-poohed, the pain slowly deteriorated within a week to nothing more than a mild ache, punctuated by the occasional worrying crunch. Now I must just lie down as much as possible for the next month or so - and am left suffering from nothing more than tedium. I would never have believed it, but there really is a limited appeal to lying around eating chocolate biscuits and reading magazines. A broken back is a strange thing. It sounds dangerous, and definitely has more kudos than piles or an ingrowing toenail. But after all the drama and dark fears, I now find myself suffering probably less discomfort than people with either of these less glamorous conditions. It makes me feel a bit of a fraud - but a very lucky fraud.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Are antibiotics best?</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> My two-year-old has a tendency to ear infections. Every time I take her to the GP we come away with a prescription for antibiotics. I can't help but feel that it can't be good for her but, on the other hand, I don't want her to suffer unnecessarily from earache, and am worried that if I don't take her to the doctor, her ears may be damaged in the future. What do you suggest? </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> This is a tricky question. A recent Dutch study has shown that if you give antibiotics to children under two with ear infections, their temperature will tend to last for two days rather than three days. But there seems to be no difference in the amount of time the children are in pain or cry, possibly because it's painkillers that help pain rather than antibiotics. Certainly, within 11 days, almost all children have fully recovered with no hearing loss or complications whether they have received anti-biotics or not. There's still lots we don't know about whether antibiotics help ear infections. When I suspected my two-year-old had an ear infection recently, I gave her paracetamol and didn't take her to our GP because I, like you, didn't really want her to have antibiotics. I have taken her subsequently just to have her eardrums and hearing checked to ensure there's been no damage. </p> <p><strong> Under pressure</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I'm 62 and have been on medication to control high blood pressure for more years than I care to remember. My blood pressure is always fine when I have it checked. I don't really get any side effects from it but I hate taking tablets. Do you think I could just stop them? </p> <p> <strong> A:</strong> If you have had a heart attack or stroke in the past, you would be wise to stay on the medication because you would be at great risk of a recurrence if your blood pressure were to rise. Similarly, if you're diabetic, a heavy smoker or have high cholesterol and a strong family history of heart disease, you may not want to risk it. But if you're at low risk of heart disease and strokes, you may well be able to try coming off the medication. A recent study of 18 general practices in north-east England showed that 22% of people who came off their blood pressure medication were able to stay off it after three years. You can try to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level by losing excess weight and cutting down on salt and alcohol which all have a direct effect on blood pressure. </p> <p><strong> Morning-after upset</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I recently needed emergency contraception after an unexpectedly successful date. My GP said I could have the morning-after pill or have a coil fitted. I went for the morning-after pill and felt sick as a dog. If I need it again, should I go for the coil? </p> <p> <strong> A:</strong> Emergency contraception is a godsend if you get caught short but can be a hassle to get hold of, especially since the UK doesn't allow pharmacists to sell morning-after pills over the counter. I'd try the new emergency contraceptive pill, Levonelle-2. It contains a progestogen hormone only so is like a massive dose of the mini-pill. It's 95% effective if taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex, and 85% effective if taken within three days. Levonelle-2 seems to cause less nausea and vomiting so may be worth a try. You can also have a coil fitted within five days of unprotected sex and the advantage is that it can remain in your womb for five years, if you wish, and provide long-term contraception. The disadvantages are that if you get a sexually transmitted infection there's a risk it will spread to the tubes, which can impair fertility, and that periods tend to be heavier and more painful. Despite that, I believe that coils are greatly underrated. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

      "bodyText": "Chelsea bad boy Dennis Wise was the surprise inclusion in the England side named by Kevin Keegan today to face Argentina at Wembley. The midfielder, who has a history of disciplinary problems and is currently charged with misconduct following his alleged involvement in a tunnel bust-up after the Blues' recent game against Wimbledon, replaces Paul Ince in central midfield. \"The difference is that Paul Ince has played the last two games and I know what he can do at this level,\" explained Keegan. \"Dennis Wise hasn't played for a while and I have to have a look at him.

And there's no reason why he can't transform that to England.\" Leeds winger Jason Wilcox is given a chance to see if he is the to the side's long-standing left-sided problem. Up front, Leicester striker Emile Heskey makes his first start for his country following four substitute appearances as he partners Alan Shearer, although Kevin Phillips may still be involved in tomorrow night's game at some stage. Wise, 33, did appear as a substitute against Belgium in the friendly at Sunderland last October but his last start for his country was way back in December 1995 against Portugal. However, along with David Beckham and Paul Scholes, he makes up a midfield trio at the heart of a 5-3-2 formation picked by Keegan for tomorrow night's game. Wilcox has been included in an England line-up for the first time since he came on as a substitute against France under Howard Wilkinson just over 12 months ago. His form since his recent move to Elland Road and his left-footed ability have earned him a recall at wing-back. In defence, Gareth Southgate partners Sol Campbell and Martin Keown, while there is surprisingly no place for Rio Ferdinand, who - along with Gareth Barry - will be hoping to come off the bench at some stage. However, Keegan's decision not to give Ferdinand a starting place now leaves the West Ham defender with an uphill battle to put himself in the frame for the Euro 2000 line-up given the lack of opportunities which remain before the tournament begins. With Wilcox at left wing-back, adaptable Newcastle midfielder Kieron Dyer will start on the other flank, winning his fourth cap. With David Seaman keeping his place in goal ahead of Nigel Martyn, the team shows a total of five changes from the line-up which faced Scotland at Wembley last November. England team to face Argentina in tomorrow night's Wembley friendly: Seaman (Arsenal) Dyer (Newcastle) Keown (Arsenal) Southgate (Aston Villa) Campbell (Tottenham) Wilcox (Leeds) Wise (Chelsea) Beckham (Man Utd) Scholes (Man Utd) Shearer (Newcastle) Heskey (Leicester)",

The corporation is looking for money to help develop new and existing digital channels and internet services. <br> A committee of inquiry with a remit of investigating alternative ways of funding the BBC, led by City economist Gavyn Davies, recommended viewers taking digital TV should pay a supplement to the licence fee on a sliding scale, from \u00a31.99 a month from next April to 99p in 2006 and disappearing by 2010. This would have given the BBC about one-third of its request for \u00a3650m but it was rejected.</p> <p><b>Why was there such opposition to the proposed digital licence fee? </b><br> Dubbed a digital poll tax by opponents, it was condemned by commercial broadcasters, notably Sky, as a disincentive to take up digital television. It was also thought to be at the heart of rows between the treasury, No 10, the trade secretary Stephen Byers and Chris Smith. <br> Sky has brought in QCs, invoked European law, refused to hand over its database to enable the digital licence fee to be collected and fought a skirmish over News 24.</p> <p><b>What is the history of the television licence fee? </b><br> First imposed in November 1922, the 10-shilling licence fee funded BBC radio. In 1946 a combined TV and radio licence fee was introduced at a cost of \u00a32. In 1968 a colour TV licence was introduced at \u00a310, against \u00a35 for a black and white set, and \u00a31 and 5 shillings for a radio-only licence. The radio-only licences were abolished the following year, but the linkage the commercial TV industry is currently contesting had been established: namely, that technical innovation spells increase in the licence fee. Many have argued that a digital supplement was simply following the established pattern.</p> <p><b>The government has recommended some \"tough love\" measures for the BBC. What are they and how will they be implemented? </b><br> Culture secretary Chris Smith has said that the corporation must embark on a programme of self-help. It must generate \u00a31.1bn of income by slashing bureaucracy, cutting waste and forming new commercial ventures. The package of measures includes a review of the BBC's board of governors, independent investigations of its fair trading and finances, and public inquiries into the success of its digital services, starting with the controversial News 24. <br>The government rejected the committee of inquiry's suggestion that BBC studios could be privatised. However, there will be pressure on the corporation to make better use of its assets and property.</p> <p><b>Why do many in the industry believe the BBC mishandled the whole funding issue? </b><br> The BBC is said to have done itself no favours in its handling of the economics. One government source said the BBC \"has been fantastically unclear on how they justify their figures\". Others pointed out that the convoluted handover between former director general John Birt and new man Greg Dyke prolonged the process. Many criticised the `arrogance' of the BBC's senior executives who regarded the intrusion into their plans as unwarranted. Senior government figures are still angry that they were forced to send a set of external consultants into the corporation before Christmas to analyse the BBC's finances and cost assumptions for new services. </p> <p><b>Will the BBC become more commercial? </b><br> Yes. BBC Worldwide - the commercial arm of the BBC - is currently working with broadcasters and publishers to increase the corporation's commercial income. The BBC's websites could be potentially very lucrative.</p> <p><b>Useful link</b><br><a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/BBCREPORT.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Department for Culture, Media and Sport: The Future Funding of the BBC - download the report</a></p>",

The radio-only licences were abolished the following year, but the linkage the commercial TV industry is currently contesting had been established: namely, that technical innovation spells increase in the licence fee. Many have argued that a digital supplement was simply following the established pattern. The government has recommended some \"tough love\" measures for the BBC. What are they and how will they be implemented? Culture secretary Chris Smith has said that the corporation must embark on a programme of self-help. It must generate \u00a31.1bn of income by slashing bureaucracy, cutting waste and forming new commercial ventures. The package of measures includes a review of the BBC's board of governors, independent investigations of its fair trading and finances, and public inquiries into the success of its digital services, starting with the controversial News 24. The government rejected the committee of inquiry's suggestion that BBC studios could be privatised. However, there will be pressure on the corporation to make better use of its assets and property. Why do many in the industry believe the BBC mishandled the whole funding issue? The BBC is said to have done itself no favours in its handling of the economics. One government source said the BBC \"has been fantastically unclear on how they justify their figures\". Others pointed out that the convoluted handover between former director general John Birt and new man Greg Dyke prolonged the process. Many criticised the `arrogance' of the BBC's senior executives who regarded the intrusion into their plans as unwarranted. Senior government figures are still angry that they were forced to send a set of external consultants into the corporation before Christmas to analyse the BBC's finances and cost assumptions for new services. Will the BBC become more commercial? Yes. BBC Worldwide - the commercial arm of the BBC - is currently working with broadcasters and publishers to increase the corporation's commercial income. The BBC's websites could be potentially very lucrative. Useful link Department for Culture, Media and Sport: The Future Funding of the BBC - download the report",

Cruise recently completed filming on Mission Impossible 2 and has deliberately not signed on for any other work in an attempt to get the Fox film off the ground. With Spielberg now all but confirmed, it appears that the tactic has worked. \u0095 Two new releases finished in a statistical dead heat at the end of the Presidents Day holiday weekend in the US. With final figures in, it appears as though Hanging Up - adapted from the novel by Delia Ephron and starring Meg Ryan - and The Whole Nine Yards, starring Friends' Matthew Perry, share joint top spot at the American box office. Both films took $15m in their first three days of release. The unheralded children's film Snow Day is third with $11m. Meanwhile, The Beach, having debuted at number two last week, slumped to seventh position with income of just under the $7m. \u0095 Hollywood legend Gregory Peck has announced his retirement from acting. Speaking at the Elsinore theatre in Salem, Oregon, where he first trod the boards in 1942, Peck told the audience: \"I just want to stop now.\" The 83-year-old actor, who won an Oscar in 1962 for his role as lawyer Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mocking Bird, is starring in a one-man show about his life at the theatre. During his screen career, he was the hero in Spellbound, Cape Fear, Roman Holiday, Moby Dick and Guns of Navarone. Peck said: \"I think I've been a pretty good entertainer and made a few good pictures. But I don't feel any sense of accomplishment.\" Casting couch \u0095 Jodie Foster is to play a one-legged nun in an adaptation of Chris Furhman's novel The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, reports Screen Daily. The film, scripted by Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni, has been developed by Foster's production company, Egg Pictures, and will be funded by Initial Entertainment Group. Former commercials maker Peter Care is slated to direct. In addition to her eccentric acting role, Foster will also take a co-producer's credit. \u0095 Kevin Spacey is lined up to take the lead role of 60s crooner Bobby Darin in a Warner Bros biopic directed by Barry Levinson. Appearing on the American TV show 60 Minutes on Sunday, Spacey quipped that he would have signed for the role \"by the time this programme airs\". According to industry insiders, Spacey has been attempting to kickstart a film about Bobby Darin for more than two years.",

      "body": "<p>As footballing misdemeanours go, David Beckham's was nothing if not original. Endearing even. Not for him missing training because of a poisonous hangover, a spell in the cells at Her Majesty's pleasure or an overnight at the Priory. No, Beckham apparently missed a session at Manchester United's swanky new Carrington training complex because he was attending to his baby's nappy. Poor Brooklyn was suffering from gastroenteritis and Becks felt he needed to be discharging his parental duty at the boy's bedside in the Hertfordshire stockbroker belt rather than tearing around practising his crosses in Manchester. </p> <p>Indeed, for a moment yesterday, David Beckham - footballer, Spice-spouse, celebrity clotheshorse - looked in danger of acquiring a rather more sober reputation for himself, as a champion of fathers' rights. Who, besides Sir Alex Ferguson, could resist the account of how he skipped training to tend to his baby? Who didn't sympathise when, reappearing on Saturday, he was castigated for his absence in front of other team members and ultimately kept out of the line-up for Sunday's crunch match against Leeds? This wasn't a petulant star throwing a tantrum. This was a father, being responsible, loving his sick son. </p> <p>At least, that is the way that Beckham's public relations people have been selling it since Sunday night. The machinery that protects both Beckham and his wife, Victoria Adams, is so efficient that, within hours of the final whistle it had whirred into action, repulsing questions about Ferguson's snub with news of the baby's illness and Beckham's role as super-dad. Was it a piece of face-saving spin? Or a genuine clash between Beckham's new man sensibilities and Ferguson's old style dogma? </p> <p>What isn't in dispute is the broader irritation that Ferguson has for Beckham's lifestyle. Unfortunately for the footballer, his admirable attempts at behaving like a new dad brought him foursquare into conflict with his manager, a man who can be described by many adjectives, new not among them. Committed would be a more appropriate description for the knight of the realm. Obsessed might be another. Sir Alex is a football manager who believes that nothing - not wine, not women, and certainly not a child - should come between a footballer and his profession. </p> <p>But when Sir Alex chose to bawl his player out in full view of the press cameras in the middle of the training pitch on Saturday, rather than, say, behind the closed doors of his office, he was making a point which went far beyond this minor transgression. Ferguson is the most adept manipulator of the press in football management history. Nothing he does is by chance; he will have known how the row with Beckham will have played. He was sending out a very public signal which said there is only one way we do things round here: my way. </p> <p>Over the past few months, Ferguson, a man who finds the increasing Hollywoodisation of football as perplexing as it is distasteful, has become more and more worried about Beckham's commitment. He believes that the boy's lifestyle is incompatible with the needs of a Manchester United footballer. </p> <p>To be fair to Beckham, there is no sign whatsoever that he is going off the rails in the traditional footballing manner involving drink, women and industrial quantities of white powder. On the pitch he looks fit and alert, his abilities apparently at their peak. To the outside eye he appears dedicated. But Ferguson demands that his players, particularly at this crowded point of the season, concentrate all their focus on football. When not training and playing, they should be resting. </p> <p>\"Energy is so vital,\" is one of his favourite phrases. \"It needs to be nurtured and preserved.\" It should certainly not, he believes, be wasted on a daily 350-mile round trip between the Beckham household in Hertfordshire and the Manchester training ground; or, indeed, attending such fripperies as film premieres, fashion shows and photo opportunities. Ferguson is worried that he is losing his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to an orbit he cannot and does not want to understand: the world of stellar celebrity. </p> <p>To understand the nature of this distaste, one must look at the people who, with an acutely honed grasp of the dynamics of news agendas, handle the Beckhams' publicity. They could not be further from Old Trafford. Both Victoria and David are represented by Caroline McAteer, a company director at the Outside Organisation, a public relations firm specialising in rock acts that lists among its clients David Bowie, Elton John and Lenny Kravitz.</p> <p>Last summer, McAteer oversaw the delicate revelation that her client Stephen Gates, singer with the band Boyzone, was gay. This potentially ruinous splash - Boyzone's fan base is made up of teenage girls in love with the band members - was turned by McAteer from a turkey into a soppy piece of feelgood. Gates' fans/mum/ boyfriend stood by him and he came out of the episode all the more distinguished for his courage. </p> <p>And so, the cynical might speculate, it has been with Posh and Becks. Recall if you can that heady week last December when Beckham was in Minshull Street crown court, Manchester, defending himself on speeding charges. A week after receiving an eight-month driving ban for pushing his silver Ferrari 26mph above the limit, Judge Barry Woodward upheld Beckham's appeal and handed back his licence, citing \"special circumstances\". This meant Beckham's fame - and the footballer used his time in the witness box to reveal how he and Victoria had fended off a potential kidnapper who had tried to grab Brooklyn several days earlier. Headlines such as \"Anger as Beckham escapes speeding by blaming snappers\" melted into \"How Posh stopped baby-snatcher.\" Beckham and Victoria were transformed from spoilt celebrities into heroic parents. </p> <p>The Beckham's version of last Friday night's events carries off a similar about turn. News broke of the baby's illness on Sunday night, when McAteer made a statement to the Press Association news agency, explaining that, after ringing Old Trafford to excuse himself, Beckham had not shown up on Friday to look after Brooklyn. At this early stage, there was some doubt over the nature of his ailment. \"David missed training on Friday because Brooklyn had a cold and he had to stay home to look after him,\" is how McAteer is quoted in that first report. By Monday morning, this \"cold\" had escalated into full-blown gastroenteritis, characterised in the Sun as \"a raging temperature and breathing difficulties\", and in the Daily Mail as \"a bad cough\". </p> <p>\"I just said Brooklyn was ill,\" says McAteer. \"I didn't want to give out any details. I am having words with the writers who wrote otherwise.\" Not very stern words, one imagines, since McAteer can now spookily reveal to the Guardian that, in the middle of Thursday night, Brooklyn started coughing and throwing up, but that by mid-afternoon on Friday, he was fine again. Those sceptical of the gravity of his illness, however, noted that Victoria Adams was able to attend the finale of London Fashion Week on Friday evening. \"I saw Victoria on Friday night and she said Brooklyn was a lot better,\" says McAteer. \"She wouldn't have gone out otherwise.\" </p> <p>Whether Brooklyn was ill or not is of less concern, one suspects, than the question of whether Beckham stayed at home at the behest of his wife. The subtext to this row, which left Beckham sulking in the stands for the biggest game of his club's season so far, was not so much the baby Beckham, it was the wife, the artist formally known as Posh. </p> <p>In football, a strong wife has traditionally been regarded as the first indication of serial deviance. Football wives should quietly provide a stable home life and nothing more. Well, apart from Cup Final day when they should look decorative in the pre-match television feature filmed at the the hairdressers. As players such as Nick Barmby, David Unsworth and Trevor Francis have discovered, a wife who wishes to have some sort of say in where their husband might chose to work for a living - the kind of input partners in virtually any other profession would expect - will invite ridicule within the game. </p> <p>And it is not just in Britain that such prejudice exists within the game. Last season, Zinedine Zidane, the France and Juventus player, was ridiculed by the Italian media after it became clear his wife was keen that he secured a move to somewhere warm. Juventus's owner, Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat magnate, called a press conference to laugh at the player. \"Zizou must decide who wears the trousers in his household,\" he said. </p> <p>Tittering reporters told Italian television viewers that they were keen to secure a response from Zidane but they couldn't because, although willing to talk, he had to dash home to do the ironing. </p> <p>Victoria Beckham, however, is a new variant on the footballer's wife: a woman whose level of celebrity is even more elevated than that of her husband. Players have been married to pop stars before, but you could never imagine Billy Wright, married to one of the Beverley sisters, being quite so keen to be seen by her side at a fashion shoot. Moreover, Victoria appears to have an almost pathalogical need for publicity, she breathes the oxygen of headlines to reinforce her self-esteem, to reassure herself that she still matters. And there is no better way for her to accrue those headlines than with her husband by her side. Besides, they want to be together, they clearly dote on one another. </p> <p>Thus Beckham finds himself pulled between two forces which represent the old and the new faces of football. On the one hand is the autocratic, old style football manager who gave him the opportunity he most wanted in his life - to play for Manchester United, the club he loved from boyhood - but who continues to demand that all peripheries should be sacrificed to the cause. On the other is the wife he adores, who doesn't quite understand why everyone gets so worked up about a silly game and believes since he is good enough to play for whoever he wishes, now might be the time to pursue his profession somewhere drier, somewhere closer to the centre of the world, frankly somewhere more convenient than Manchester - like Milan, say. </p> <p>Oddly, in the end, the two forces might not be mutually exclusive: both might get their way. If, as is widely rumoured, Beckham moves on this summer, Posh will have her husband where she wants him and Ferguson will have re-established his authority. Plus he will have several tens of millions in his transfer account to pick up a player less distracted by incidentals. And Beckham? Well, at least he will get more time to spend with the family.</p>",

And there is no better way for her to accrue those headlines than with her husband by her side. Besides, they want to be together, they clearly dote on one another. Thus Beckham finds himself pulled between two forces which represent the old and the new faces of football. On the one hand is the autocratic, old style football manager who gave him the opportunity he most wanted in his life - to play for Manchester United, the club he loved from boyhood - but who continues to demand that all peripheries should be sacrificed to the cause. On the other is the wife he adores, who doesn't quite understand why everyone gets so worked up about a silly game and believes since he is good enough to play for whoever he wishes, now might be the time to pursue his profession somewhere drier, somewhere closer to the centre of the world, frankly somewhere more convenient than Manchester - like Milan, say. Oddly, in the end, the two forces might not be mutually exclusive: both might get their way. If, as is widely rumoured, Beckham moves on this summer, Posh will have her husband where she wants him and Ferguson will have re-established his authority. Plus he will have several tens of millions in his transfer account to pick up a player less distracted by incidentals. And Beckham? Well, at least he will get more time to spend with the family.",

Therefore we are losing influence as far as these committees are concerned\". Also on the platform with Mr Byers were Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrats' treasury spokesman, and Ian Taylor, dropped from the Conservative frontbench for his Europhile views. The backbench Tory warned that delay on the euro is unsettling business, and urged ministers to make their preparations clearer. Britain in Europe was embarrassed last week when an academic survey was twisted to suggest that job losses from leaving the EU could reach 8m - dismissed as \"absurd\". Yesterday a new study by South Bank university confirmed that 2.5m jobs are directly dependent on exports to the EU, 900,000 more indirectly so. The chancellor's message will be that the government is not afraid to continue with practical preparations for the euro, despite the Tories' new Keep the Pound campaign. In his speech, Mr Brown will attack those who \"seek to renegotiate the basis of our membership of the European Union\" for putting at risk \"the stability that is central to modern business and investment decisions. \"The real risk of endless talk of 'in' or 'out' of Europe is the risk that investors start to believe that Britain is semi-detached.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>Babette Cole reaches the parts other authors do not dare to reach...  Joanna Carey talks to her about feminist fairytales and books tackling 'difficult' areas</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\"People always expect me to be a dear old thing in a cottage with roses round the door and a pussy cat on my knee,\" says Babette Cole. It's not how I'd pictured her - with books like Mummy Laid an Egg! and the recent Hair in Funny Places (about puberty) she's revolutionised the way small children can learn about the facts of life, and I imagined she'd be like the heroine of her very funny, feminist fairytale, Princess Smartypants, who didn't want to get married, and planned \"to live in her castle with her pets and do exactly as she pleased\". And I wasn't disappointed. </p> <p>Babette lives not in a castle, but at her stud-farm in rural Lincolnshire. Small, blonde, rather glamorous in slinky caramel suede and a long fake fur coat, she meets me at the station in a colossal four-wheel drive vehicle, having just dropped off her \"other half\" on his way to London. Funny, friendly, she talks in exclamatory speech bubbles, with dizzy shrieks of laughter. She's only just back from a holiday which, among other things, involved crewing for the British Virgin Islands ladies yacht racing team, and a starry spell in New York discussing the forthcoming film of Princess Smartypants. </p> <p>Back at work now, with her horses and her latest picture book, she talks about life down on the farm \"among the acres of mangel Worzels\". Like Smartypants, she's unmarried - but talks a lot about her \"other half\" - a Barbados-born Londoner, \"quite unmarriable!\" she says merrily - \"and we've been together for 18 years\"... she talks about money - she earned a \"huge amount\" in the 80s, when there was an upsurge in children's books; and now, translated into 72 languages, her sales are astronomical - \"but then so are my vet's bills - around \u00a31,000 a month!\" </p> <p>She moved from Kent some years ago to have more room for the horses and as we drive through the beautiful flat, frosty Lincolnshire landscape, she talks with passion about the threat posed to the rural economy by the government's plan to outlaw foxhunting - \"it's a way of life round here,\" she says, as we stop at a tack shop to buy a huge pile of horse blankets. </p> <p>Like a scene from one of her extravagantly funny books, Babette's house is full of dogs. A huge deerhound the size of an ironing board is chewing the back of a church pew in the kitchen, another sleeps on a duvet by the Aga, and a third reclines on a leopard-print sofa, wearing a tiara. </p> <p>And horses are much in evidence - bridles, bits and halters dangle from the ceiling, the walls shimmer with satin rosettes, and equestrian trophies jostle for space with book awards. There's a stuffed fox and a glossy magazine offering \"A Window on the World of Side-saddle\", another of Babette's passions. Voted \"Side-saddle Personality of the Year\", there are countless photos of her - horsey, saucy and impossibly elegant soaring over Grand National-style fences.</p> <p>\"Riding side-saddle, I feel like a real lady,\" she says, describing with relish the costume - bowler hat, silk stock, tailored habit and a vital undergarment which, in true Smartypants style, is supplied by the Queen Mother's corsetiere in Knightsbridge. She's also a champion Team Chaser - and at the flick of a switch, sponsored by her publishers, the fearless Red Fox Letsgo Ladies team goes thundering by on video. </p> <p>It's clear that to combine such horsemanship with a career as a best-selling author-illustrator of over 90 books needs an iron discipline - and a good head for business. Babette's studio is at the top of the house, a light-filled space, where, uninterrupted by dogs, she talks about her work. Born in Jersey, she attended a convent school and was good at drawing - \"I made lots of feast day cards. Basically, the school offered a choice of three careers - you could be a nun, a wife and mother, or you could go off the rails...\"</p> <p>Babette chose to go to art school in England - with her pony.

      "bodyText": "\"People always expect me to be a dear old thing in a cottage with roses round the door and a pussy cat on my knee,\" says Babette Cole. It's not how I'd pictured her - with books like Mummy Laid an Egg! and the recent Hair in Funny Places (about puberty) she's revolutionised the way small children can learn about the facts of life, and I imagined she'd be like the heroine of her very funny, feminist fairytale, Princess Smartypants, who didn't want to get married, and planned \"to live in her castle with her pets and do exactly as she pleased\". And I wasn't disappointed. Babette lives not in a castle, but at her stud-farm in rural Lincolnshire. Small, blonde, rather glamorous in slinky caramel suede and a long fake fur coat, she meets me at the station in a colossal four-wheel drive vehicle, having just dropped off her \"other half\" on his way to London. Funny, friendly, she talks in exclamatory speech bubbles, with dizzy shrieks of laughter. She's only just back from a holiday which, among other things, involved crewing for the British Virgin Islands ladies yacht racing team, and a starry spell in New York discussing the forthcoming film of Princess Smartypants. Back at work now, with her horses and her latest picture book, she talks about life down on the farm \"among the acres of mangel Worzels\". Like Smartypants, she's unmarried - but talks a lot about her \"other half\" - a Barbados-born Londoner, \"quite unmarriable!\" she says merrily - \"and we've been together for 18 years\"... she talks about money - she earned a \"huge amount\" in the 80s, when there was an upsurge in children's books; and now, translated into 72 languages, her sales are astronomical - \"but then so are my vet's bills - around \u00a31,000 a month!\" She moved from Kent some years ago to have more room for the horses and as we drive through the beautiful flat, frosty Lincolnshire landscape, she talks with passion about the threat posed to the rural economy by the government's plan to outlaw foxhunting - \"it's a way of life round here,\" she says, as we stop at a tack shop to buy a huge pile of horse blankets. Like a scene from one of her extravagantly funny books, Babette's house is full of dogs. A huge deerhound the size of an ironing board is chewing the back of a church pew in the kitchen, another sleeps on a duvet by the Aga, and a third reclines on a leopard-print sofa, wearing a tiara. And horses are much in evidence - bridles, bits and halters dangle from the ceiling, the walls shimmer with satin rosettes, and equestrian trophies jostle for space with book awards. There's a stuffed fox and a glossy magazine offering \"A Window on the World of Side-saddle\", another of Babette's passions. Voted \"Side-saddle Personality of the Year\", there are countless photos of her - horsey, saucy and impossibly elegant soaring over Grand National-style fences. \"Riding side-saddle, I feel like a real lady,\" she says, describing with relish the costume - bowler hat, silk stock, tailored habit and a vital undergarment which, in true Smartypants style, is supplied by the Queen Mother's corsetiere in Knightsbridge. She's also a champion Team Chaser - and at the flick of a switch, sponsored by her publishers, the fearless Red Fox Letsgo Ladies team goes thundering by on video. It's clear that to combine such horsemanship with a career as a best-selling author-illustrator of over 90 books needs an iron discipline - and a good head for business. Babette's studio is at the top of the house, a light-filled space, where, uninterrupted by dogs, she talks about her work. Born in Jersey, she attended a convent school and was good at drawing - \"I made lots of feast day cards. Basically, the school offered a choice of three careers - you could be a nun, a wife and mother, or you could go off the rails...\" Babette chose to go to art school in England - with her pony. Accommodation with grazing facilities was unavailable in London, so they went to Canterbury art school, where she rented a field. By her third year she was taking ideas for books to publishers. After a spell at the BBC, she first made her name with her explosively funny feminist fairytales. But what started her off on these \"issue books\"? \"One day my publisher asked me to do a book for young children about sex. He wanted it to be an animal book but I said no! I'll do it with real people. He said you can't! But I DID!\" And in Mummy Laid an Egg! two children explain to their own parents the mechanics of human reproduction using their own schematic drawings. The book is hugely funny and graphically explicit though - at so many removes from reality - not alarmingly so. Babette has no children and she says: \"I probably couldn't have done this if I'd been approaching it from a 'motherly' point of view. Yes, I know these are difficult areas, but they should be addressed before they become difficult.\" Her uninhibited approach has raised a few eyebrows, but, spurred on by the scarcity of books of this sort (and a bold publisher), she has galloped headlong through sex, puberty, wet dreams, periods, health and hygiene, head-lice, worms, smoking, old age and even death. \"Complaints?

      "body": "<p>Julie Roberts calls herself a historian, a researcher who seeks to interpret the past. But she doesn't write books or spend time among dusty archives. She is an artist who paints unsettling, highly charged, surreal pictures. They are painstaking canvases of historic objects and scenes, such as Sigmund Freud's desk and chair; Charles Darwin's study; macabre old surgical instruments all rendered with intense and vivid realism floating in isolation against a background of strong, unbroken colour.</p> <p>Until now Roberts, 37, has been earning her living tutoring part-time at the Glasgow School of Art and selling her work internationally through exhibitions. But a new fellowship scheme means she will receive government funding for practice-based research that will give her time to pursue her interests further. </p> <p>Those working in the creative and performing arts have long argued that at least some of what they do is about pushing back the boundaries of knowledge and perception and should be funded as research. Until now artists and performers have had to choose between teaching or selling their work or skill. </p> <p>Although many universities have tried to plug the gap with artists-in-residencies, these have varied greatly from institution to institution, and have often been poorly paid with no clear role for the person in post. A major complaint is that they have suffered from lack of parity with the humanities, which have traditionally enjoyed post-doctoral fellowships funded by the British Academy. </p> <p>In response, the Arts and Humanities Research Board has announced its first appointments of Fellows in the Performing and Creative Arts, their field ranging from art and design and media studies to music, drama and dance. </p> <p>Thirty-two fellows have been selected, each one undertaking a substantial research project supported by their institution for which they will receive \u00a345,000 over three years. The scheme is to be advertised annually. </p> <p>According to the research board, the scheme has been designed for researchers with an established record \"who show outstanding potential\" but who do not hold a full-time post in a UK university. </p> <p>Glasgow School of Art is delighted that the innovation it fosters at the heart of its creative culture is at long last being recognised. It is one of only two institutions to have received funding for two fellowships, Southampton University being the other. </p> <p>Clare Barclay, 31, is a very different kind of artist to Roberts. She is a sculptor who investigates society's relationship to nature and \"wilderness\" - the way it uses and views materials. Her works of art often look like found, abandoned objects. </p> <p>Although respected in her field and a graduate of Glasgow, she has made a precarious living from her art. The fellowship, she says, frees her to pursue her investigations and develop her work further without always having to produce a saleable product. </p> <p>Clare is being given studio space in the art school where students will be able go and learn from her work. \"It will be very much hands-on,\" she said. \"I will be developing my knowledge and skills in using materials, such as metal machining and what students will see is the practical graft involved in making an art object from beginning to end.\" </p> <p>Roberts will undertake the Ruskin Project - a series of paintings and works on paper in a book about the Victorian artist and writer. \"I'm interested in the way artists in the past have tried to control the way we regard social and political events, for example, in the role of David (the French neo-classical painter) in the French revolution. </p> <p>\"Similarly I want to look at the way Ruskin wanted to control the way we see things, and the way he controlled those around him such as the women he corresponded with. But I shall do this through making sketches, paintings and even film.\" </p> <p>Roberts also wants to tie this in with \"new ways\" of teaching. She will take students with her on her visits to the places Ruskin stayed at and, through her work, teach about all aspects of painting, technique, application and criticism. </p> <p>Bob Wyatt, deputy chairman of Glasgow's fine art research committee said the fellowships were an important, formal acknowledgement that art practice could be viewed as research.

      "bodyText": "Julie Roberts calls herself a historian, a researcher who seeks to interpret the past. But she doesn't write books or spend time among dusty archives. She is an artist who paints unsettling, highly charged, surreal pictures. They are painstaking canvases of historic objects and scenes, such as Sigmund Freud's desk and chair; Charles Darwin's study; macabre old surgical instruments all rendered with intense and vivid realism floating in isolation against a background of strong, unbroken colour. Until now Roberts, 37, has been earning her living tutoring part-time at the Glasgow School of Art and selling her work internationally through exhibitions. But a new fellowship scheme means she will receive government funding for practice-based research that will give her time to pursue her interests further. Those working in the creative and performing arts have long argued that at least some of what they do is about pushing back the boundaries of knowledge and perception and should be funded as research. Until now artists and performers have had to choose between teaching or selling their work or skill. Although many universities have tried to plug the gap with artists-in-residencies, these have varied greatly from institution to institution, and have often been poorly paid with no clear role for the person in post. A major complaint is that they have suffered from lack of parity with the humanities, which have traditionally enjoyed post-doctoral fellowships funded by the British Academy. In response, the Arts and Humanities Research Board has announced its first appointments of Fellows in the Performing and Creative Arts, their field ranging from art and design and media studies to music, drama and dance. Thirty-two fellows have been selected, each one undertaking a substantial research project supported by their institution for which they will receive \u00a345,000 over three years. The scheme is to be advertised annually. According to the research board, the scheme has been designed for researchers with an established record \"who show outstanding potential\" but who do not hold a full-time post in a UK university. Glasgow School of Art is delighted that the innovation it fosters at the heart of its creative culture is at long last being recognised. It is one of only two institutions to have received funding for two fellowships, Southampton University being the other. Clare Barclay, 31, is a very different kind of artist to Roberts. She is a sculptor who investigates society's relationship to nature and \"wilderness\" - the way it uses and views materials. Her works of art often look like found, abandoned objects. Although respected in her field and a graduate of Glasgow, she has made a precarious living from her art. The fellowship, she says, frees her to pursue her investigations and develop her work further without always having to produce a saleable product. Clare is being given studio space in the art school where students will be able go and learn from her work. \"It will be very much hands-on,\" she said. \"I will be developing my knowledge and skills in using materials, such as metal machining and what students will see is the practical graft involved in making an art object from beginning to end.\" Roberts will undertake the Ruskin Project - a series of paintings and works on paper in a book about the Victorian artist and writer. \"I'm interested in the way artists in the past have tried to control the way we regard social and political events, for example, in the role of David (the French neo-classical painter) in the French revolution. \"Similarly I want to look at the way Ruskin wanted to control the way we see things, and the way he controlled those around him such as the women he corresponded with. But I shall do this through making sketches, paintings and even film.\" Roberts also wants to tie this in with \"new ways\" of teaching. She will take students with her on her visits to the places Ruskin stayed at and, through her work, teach about all aspects of painting, technique, application and criticism. Bob Wyatt, deputy chairman of Glasgow's fine art research committee said the fellowships were an important, formal acknowledgement that art practice could be viewed as research. He also felt artists would benefit from being accountable to an outside agency as well as their institution and having to work to definite outcomes. He said: \"We think this is the best thing that has ever happened to art schools.\" Paul Langford, chief executive of the research board, said that as the British Academy post-doctoral fellowship scheme had produced distinguished scholars for the humanities over the years, there should be the same opportunity for the arts. \"We have a very strong sense of mission to make a major contribution to the development of university-based arts research,\" he said, adding that it would give new universities a chance to excel. \"Some of the new universities have a strong commitment to the arts and they will benefit from this in being able to reinforce a research culture.\" The scheme, he said, would also avoid the pitfalls of an artist-in-residency by requiring institutions to specify what support they will give to fellows and fully including them in the university's research endeavour. \"We would regard the fellowship as having failed if artists feel isolated.\" This first wave of fellowships includes an enormously wide range of projects and some distinguished practitioners such as Howard Brenton, the political playwright, who will be based at Birmingham University. He has entitled his research programme The Playwright and the State, and will look at the cultural and performance contexts of political drama through the production of a monograph, three experimental \"labtexts\" for performance produced through student workshops, as well as papers and postgraduate seminars. David Norris is one of the fellows appointed to Southampton University. A successful international concert pianist as well as a broadcaster, he was a former professor at the Royal Academy of Music and is currently Southampton's head of keyboard, a part-time post. As part of his Fellowship he will become a tutor to the university's new Performance MA, but he will also pursue research into the relationship between the composer JC Bach and the square piano.

Only one other local education authority, Essex, could boast as many. Less surprising, considering the number of top-80 qualifiers employing some form of selection, is that three of the Birmingham contingent are grammar schools. Lordswood Girls' is the city's only listed \"comprehensive\", although headteacher Jane Hattatt prefers to put the term in inverted commas. </p> <p>Yes, her school takes all-comers (female ones, anyway) with widely differing abilities. But, no, there are not too many pupils from the middle-class homes on the edge of leafy Harborne where Lordswood is set. With a few notable exceptions, the brightest among them usually find their way into one of Birmingham's seven grammars. \"Seven!\" Hattatt exclaims, as though still not quite able to believe it after all these years. \"That's quite extraordinary. When you add on the independent fee-paying schools, you can see how heavily creamed we've been academically. It seems to me disgraceful that successive Labour councils have not removed the grammars many years ago.\" </p> <p>Perhaps they didn't want to be accused of destroying centres of excellence, I suggest. \"You'd be creating many more,\" she says with the confidence of one who has shown that a comprehensive can compete with more advantaged neighbours and, indeed, some of the best selective schools in the land. </p> <p>Lordswood's catchment area takes in the less salubrious suburbs adjoining Harborne as well as inner-city areas. One in four pupils is eligible for free school meals. More than half speak English as a second language; 5% can hardly read when they arrive at 11, usually because they are recent arrivals in the UK. </p> <p>Paradoxically, in the light of her views on grammars, Hattatt refuses to see these factors as excuses for low achievement. \"The underlying ethos of the school is to set higher and higher expectations,\" she says, \"and to believe that it's possible.\" Music to the ears of Messrs Blair and Blunkett - not to mention the chief inspector of schools. But if Chris Woodhead was expecting unqualified gratitude for bracketing Lordswood Girls' among the country's best schools, he must have been slightly taken aback by the head's response. </p> <p>In a letter to him, she expressed her \"delight\" at making the top 80 and her support for rigorous school inspections as a way of making schools accountable to their communities. So far, so good. Then came the sting. She went on to criticise the quality of inspection teams. \"In our own experience, as an example,\" she wrote, \"several inspectors lacked first-hand knowledge of teaching the national curriculum since they were already several years into retirement. Indeed, one pupil did enquire of me 'Who are all these elderly people, Miss?'.\" </p> <p>There were nine inspectors and, by studying their CVs, Hattatt discovered that all but two had had no direct experience of teaching over the past 10 years. \"The lead inspector was excellent,\" she says, \"but she has to take the team she's given. Hardly any had taught GCSE, let alone the curriculum. Even the one responsible for technology had retired in 1993. Not exactly at the cutting edge. The English inspector had started teaching in 1951. That's before I was born.\" </p> <p>Lordswood itself wasn't built until 1959. Outside the head's study is a photograph of the first year's intake in glorious black and white. More white than black, it must be said. White ankle socks glow. White smiles gleam in white faces. The stiff-backed formality makes a telling contrast with the more natural photos of today's girls on adjacent walls. Forty years on, some 60% of the school's 800 pupils are Asian and around 10% are Afro-Caribbean. </p> <p>Hattatt comes over as a warm and approachable personality. But there's also a hint of steel, a determination to see that her girls are given the best possible start in life. </p> <p>One of Hattatt's first decisions on taking over 11 years ago was to appoint a likeminded deputy, Gail Malone. Together they set about changing the culture of the school, increasing demands on staff and pupils. \"By cutting into the time spent with form teachers after registration, we've managed to get them started earlier in the morning, which is the best time for learning,\" says Malone. \"It's only 10 minutes a day, but that's 50 minutes a week.\" </p> <p>\"Nearly an hour,\" puts in Hattatt, who has used the extra time to make room for individual assessment by a review tutor. Each child's progress is monitored every month to check that she is hitting the targets expected of her. And those targets are set not by the subjective view of a teacher, but by hard data. </p> <p>The moment a girl arrives from junior school, her details are fed into a computer. Included are key stage 2 results and tests in verbal and non-verbal reasoning. \"Where there is a big difference between the two, those children are put into what we call 'red bands',\" the head goes on. \"Because the curriculum is language-driven, it's our job to close the gap by ensuring that literacy matches intelligence. We make room for special literacy classes in a 44-lesson week.\" </p> <p>In GCSE English, 70% are now reaching grade C or above and 23% are getting As or A*. From September, the head plans to incorporate the study of Latin roots into literacy classes. \"We're introducing it just as the grammar schools are giving it up,\" she says, beaming at the irony. </p> <p>Overall, the proportion of Lordswood girls passing five or more GCSEs at grades A-C has risen to 63% - more than double the figure it was when Hattatt arrived in 1989. At that time, the girls were 2% behind nearby Lordswood Boys' School. Now they're 20% ahead. Hattatt accepts that Lordswood is part of a national trend whereby girls flourish in single-sex education, and also that other schools use computers to monitor targets. Few, though, would seem to be using the data quite so effectively. </p> <p>The head is not averse to giving the figures a tweak. \"We know from past experience,\" she says, \"that actual grades have often been higher than predicted grades. So we're now looking at our initial predictions as a floor rather than a ceiling. After all, expectations are so important.\"</p>",

From September, the head plans to incorporate the study of Latin roots into literacy classes. \"We're introducing it just as the grammar schools are giving it up,\" she says, beaming at the irony. Overall, the proportion of Lordswood girls passing five or more GCSEs at grades A-C has risen to 63% - more than double the figure it was when Hattatt arrived in 1989. At that time, the girls were 2% behind nearby Lordswood Boys' School. Now they're 20% ahead. Hattatt accepts that Lordswood is part of a national trend whereby girls flourish in single-sex education, and also that other schools use computers to monitor targets. Few, though, would seem to be using the data quite so effectively. The head is not averse to giving the figures a tweak. \"We know from past experience,\" she says, \"that actual grades have often been higher than predicted grades. So we're now looking at our initial predictions as a floor rather than a ceiling. After all, expectations are so important.\"",

      "body": "<p>Noxious smells and puffs of coloured smoke emerged from the labs the day the nervous primary school children visited their new secondary school. </p> <p>\"It was a brilliant science lesson,\" says Professor Maurice Galton, who was at the unnamed school doing a research project into primary-secondary transfer. \"It was as if Ofsted had turned up. But when those children actually moved to the secondary school in September, their science lesson consisted of five minutes filtering some water and 25 minutes copying the experiment up from the board.\" </p> <p>The move to \"big school\" is an educational milestone. Children, parents, primary and secondary schools invest huge amounts of time and emotion in it. There are prospectuses, league tables and visits; staff meetings, passing on of records, taster days and induction weeks. Yet researchers and policy-makers increasingly suspect that all this preparation and anxiety may end in disappointment. There is talk of sowing the seeds of boredom and disaffection, of a \"lost year\" at the start of secondary school. So what is going wrong? </p> <p>If you take Professor Galton's research seriously - and the government certainly does - something certainly is. In 1998 he and his colleague Dr Linda Hargreaves tested a group of children in English and maths at the end of year 6, their final year of primary school. A year later they looked at the same children - now year 7s in secondary school - again. One-third of the children had made no progress during that year and some had gone backwards to a lower level than before. The decline in English was worse than in maths; boys were more affected than girls. </p> <p>Galton and Hargreaves also measured the children's attitudes to schoolwork. The two of them sat in on year 6 and year 7 lessons, observing each child every 25 seconds to see whether they were concentrating or messing about. In the primary classroom, about 60% of the pupils concentrated for three-quarters of the lesson, whatever the subject. But after a year of secondary education, only 50% of them concentrated for that amount of time in maths, and only 35% of them paid attention in science. \"Nearly two-thirds of all (year 7) pupils taking science were distracted for significant periods of the lesson,\" Professor Galton says. </p> <p>Education secretary David Blunkett, seeing his hard-won literacy and numeracy improvements in primary schools at risk of trickling away - 13-year-olds' test scores, unlike their junior counterparts, have remained resolutely static - will not ignore research like that. </p> <p>In a recent speech he said lack of progress by children in the early years of secondary school is \"unacceptable\". He quoted two dissatisfied 12-year-olds interviewed by another researcher, Professor Jean Rudduck of Homerton College. According to one, \"year 7 work is not too difficult because it's more or less the same as year 6.\" The other observed: \"My friend Harriet doesn't feel intellectually stimulated this year.\" </p> <p> Harriet's ennui will soon be put to the test. The government has promised optional national tests to measure progress in year 7 by this summer, more summer schools for 11-year-olds this year, primary-style literacy and numeracy hours in year 7 starting in September, extra classroom training for all secondary teachers and pressure on secondary schools to set performance targets for years 7-9 by the end of next year. </p> <p>So will it be enough? If secondary schools are forced to measure their pupils' progress from the very first term, with the threat of inspection and league tables over them, will that give them both the motivation and the means for change? </p> <p>It would certainly help to focus attention on academic performance, says Professor Rudduck. According to another piece of research she carried out with Galton and Professor John Gray, also of Homerton, this one commissioned by the Department for Education and Employment, school transfer has been perceived as a problem for at least 20 years - but the problem has mainly been seen as one of relieving stress. </p> <p>Ever since then, she argues, schools have been working at making children feel secure, often very successfully. But in doing so they may have taken their eye off the academic ball. \"It's very important to reduce young people's anxiety,\" says Rudduck. \"But by putting so much effort into the social dimension of transfer, schools may be neglecting to tell young people what learning is like and how important it is in the secondary school.\" </p> <p>In some ways, if that is the case, it is not surprising. For the stress of transfer is almost certainly what concerns children and parents most. George Gercke, 12, is in year 7 at Parkside Community College, an 11-16 comprehensive in the middle of Cambridge. Before he left his village primary school, he did not worry about whether secondary school work would be interesting enough. What he worried about was whether he would cope: \"I thought it would be hard, and I thought there would be bullying.\" </p> <p> In fact, neither worry was necessary: \"There's almost no bullying: they've got absolutely hundreds of anti-bullying things. And the work is harder, but I can do it.\" His brother Laurence, due to make the same move to the same school this September, nevertheless expresses a carbon copy of George's fears: \"I'm terrified. Terrified of bullies.\" </p> <p>In that frame of mind, many schools would say, the last thing he needs as soon as he arrives is academic pressure. He will have had plenty from his SATs this summer - and that in itself, some would argue, is a big factor in the apparent under-performance that many children show in year 7. For there is anecdotal evidence that SATs are the cause as well as the measure of peaks and troughs in 11-year-olds' performance. Year 6 builds up relentlessly to the tests in English, maths and science in May, after which children may take on a project or focus on art or drama. </p> <p>Instead of a six-week summer break, they may have 10 weeks with little formal English or maths. Those who just squeezed up a level may slip back. </p> <p>Of course, they could be driven upwards again by more national tests at the end of year 7, which they might take more seriously than mere researchers' tests - another possibly explanation for their apparent under-performance. But the government also needs to take into account that it is asking children to spread themselves across a much wider curriculum in year 7, says Ann Mullins, headteacher of Highbury Fields Girls school. </p> <p>If children are tested in English, maths and science, what will be the effect on their initiation into drama, French, more formal history, geography, design technology and IT? </p> <p>\"They are pretty focused in primary schools with the literacy hour and the numeracy hour. When they come into secondary school the curriculum is much wider.\" </p> <p>Galton, Gray and Rudduck argue that these kinds of statements simply underestimate the intellectual level of work in the primary school. Galton describes asking a group of primary and secondary teachers to design an experiment for their pupils to show that they can use a thermometer. \"In the primary school they set the children lots of problems to which they had to find the answers. In the secondary school the experiment consisted of dropping the thermometer into hot water and cold water, noting the temperature, and filling in a worksheet.\" </p> <p>The difference can partly be attributed to the way secondary schools are organised, he says: with 40 minute lessons, teachers cannot let children work in the investigative way primaries do over a whole afternoon. But that is not the whole story: \"Children are operating at a high cognitive level at the end of primary school; secondary schools have to learn to build on this.\" </p> <p>If they do not at present, it may be for several reasons. They may simply not possess the information they need: a study in Worcester local education authority showed that only half the middle schools passed on children's SATs results to high schools (though 80% passed on pastoral information) and only one school in five also passed on records or portfolios of work. </p> <p>Secondary liaison teachers struggle to visit all their primary intake in the era of parental choice: they may now accept children from 40 different primary schools. It is true that all of them follow the National Curriculum, but the ways of working may still be very different. </p> <p>And in any case, says Maurice Galton, passing on information makes little difference to the many secondary teachers wedded to the idea of a \"fresh start\". They are sceptical of SATs, they know the summer break will make more difference to some than others, they want to give children a chance to shake off old self-images and show what they can do. </p> <p>In practice, he argues, this rarely does anybody any good: \"I have come across a teacher who assumes everybody is at level five and then gives extra help to children who can't do it. But generally if people talk about a fresh start they mean going over the basics. If you do that in, say, maths, then children who are bright and can already do the work get bored, while the children who found it difficult the first time round find the pace too fast and can't keep up. Everyone loses out.\" </p> <p>Yet a fresh start is exactly what George and Laurence perceive as the attraction of secondary school. George, proudly displaying a merit certificate, believes: \"I can cope even though the work is harder, because I've gone up a level.\" Laurence can't wait: \"I want to meet new people. I want to do harder work. I want to be away from all these little children running around in the playground who bump into you and then say you pushed them over.\" </p> <p>The difficulty secondary schools must grapple with, says Jean Rudduck, is balancing the desire for a fresh start - among pupils and staff - with the understanding that successful academic work builds on what has gone before. Children need to feel that they have cast off their primary selves and get work to make them think. They also need to be told that secondary learning will require them to process more facts, to practise more skills, and that if they sit back their learning will suffer. </p> <p>Teachers need to have more knowledge of, and more faith in, their primary colleagues' achievements. \"It's almost as if they don't trust them when it comes to building on the knowledge and skills their new year 7s bring with them,\" says Maurice Galto. But, says Rudduck, they also need to be explicit to their new intake about the work that will be involved. </p> <p>\"Pupils come to secondary schools with these very high expectations, partly generated by exciting taster days. Then they find there is repetition in year 7, they feel let down and boredom sets in. </p> <p>\"They need to get the message that learning is important, that it is cumulative, that they are moving on to a more advanced stage.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>The race is on to become one of the founder members of Britain's \"e-university\" following last week's announcement by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary. Observers expect half a dozen of the most advanced research universities working with the Open University to form the initial consortium - Oxford and Cambridge may not be quick enough off the mark to participate, said one. </p> <p>The project - the most ambitious since the foundation of the Open University in the 1960s - is intended to draw together the cream of expertise in British universities to mount web-based courses around the globe, competing with the major corporate and virtual universities emerging in the US. As Blunkett said, no one institution has the range of expertise or the financial clout to undertake the job. </p> <p>Universities and private companies throughout the UK are being invited by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to bid to become part of a consortium to run the e-university. </p> <p>The funding council, which will put up the pump-priming money, decided against asking existing regional consortia in an effort to secure the \"best of British\" in higher education. They may well use existing links with overseas universities, especially in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. </p> <p>With proper funding the e-university could become the biggest in the world, teaching millions of students, according to Tim O'Shea, master of Birkbeck College, London, and a member of the funding council's steering group. </p> <p>Professor O'Shea, who is also provost of Gresham College, predicted start-up costs could be as high as \u00a3120m over two years, much of it coming from private sources. Fees income is potentially huge - UK universities expect to take \u00a3560m in overseas student fees this year. </p> <p>Birkbeck's online masters degree in cystallography has two virtual seminars a week - one timed for Europe and the east coast of the US and the other for the west coast and the Pacific Rim.

      "bodyText": "The race is on to become one of the founder members of Britain's \"e-university\" following last week's announcement by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary. Observers expect half a dozen of the most advanced research universities working with the Open University to form the initial consortium - Oxford and Cambridge may not be quick enough off the mark to participate, said one. The project - the most ambitious since the foundation of the Open University in the 1960s - is intended to draw together the cream of expertise in British universities to mount web-based courses around the globe, competing with the major corporate and virtual universities emerging in the US. As Blunkett said, no one institution has the range of expertise or the financial clout to undertake the job. Universities and private companies throughout the UK are being invited by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to bid to become part of a consortium to run the e-university. The funding council, which will put up the pump-priming money, decided against asking existing regional consortia in an effort to secure the \"best of British\" in higher education. They may well use existing links with overseas universities, especially in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. With proper funding the e-university could become the biggest in the world, teaching millions of students, according to Tim O'Shea, master of Birkbeck College, London, and a member of the funding council's steering group. Professor O'Shea, who is also provost of Gresham College, predicted start-up costs could be as high as \u00a3120m over two years, much of it coming from private sources. Fees income is potentially huge - UK universities expect to take \u00a3560m in overseas student fees this year. Birkbeck's online masters degree in cystallography has two virtual seminars a week - one timed for Europe and the east coast of the US and the other for the west coast and the Pacific Rim. Prof O'Shea said for academics there would be a huge change - designing an hour-long learning experience on the web would take 200 hours so the concept depended on attracting large numbers. Tutors would also need to learn how to support students online through the use of email and computer conferencing. \"It is exciting and innovative but also credible,\" he said. \"No other country has said it will try and take the best of its higher education and make it available for electronic delivery over the web.\" Alice Frost, who is heading the project, gives full details on the council's website.

It's the creation of landscapes.</p> <p><strong>Haven't they been, as it were, created already?</strong> Well, yes, all right, it's recreating landscapes.</p> <p>&lt;B&lt;I see. You improve on things? We like to think so. A landscape architect might design, for instance, a public park to be in harmony with the environment. </p> <p><strong>Is that it, then? You make parks? </strong>Hardly. Landscape architects, also known as landscape designers, are concerned with planning, designing and constructing the whole outdoor environment.</p> <p><strong> Go on, give me some examples. </strong>Landscape architects work on settings for all types of buildings, roads, play areas and any sort of construction projects. They are also involved in preservation, for instance, of a coastline. And they are called in to rescue derelict sites - disused pits, quarries and so forth.</p> <p><strong> Are there any rules? </strong>The aim is to fit any design into its environment and to do the least possible damage to the local scenery and ecology.</p> <p><strong> How do they manage that? </strong>Ideally, by becoming involved with a project in the early stages. Working alongside architects, planners and surveyors, landscape architects/designers can suggest alterations to plans that will help a new development blend into the existing landscape. They visit sites, draw up surveys and then draw up plans and designs. These have to include projected costs, including cover for maintenance after the project is finished.</p> <p><strong> Lumme! </strong>And once the work begins, the landscape architect naturally visits a site from time to time to make sure all's going smoothly.</p> <p><strong> So, they need to be dab hands with the old HB. </strong>A landscape architect is fundamentally a designer, so creative ability is important. But to produce a design, he or she must understand civil engineering, surveying, geology, horticulture, earth-moving... <strong> I get the picture. It's an outdoor job. </strong>Actually, landscape architects usually spend less than a quarter of their time outdoors. Mostly they are toiling at their desks, or in meetings. Good communication skills are an obvious advantage.</p> <p><strong> So, how do I dig into this world? </strong>It takes a degree, if not a further degree.</p> <p><strong> Ooh er! </strong>Yep. You can start by taking an undergraduate degree in landscape architecture. Two A levels or their equivalent are minimum requirements for entry. Art, biology, botany and geography are considered relevant subjects at A level. Or you can do a postgraduate course after taking a degree in a related subject, eg architecture or horticulture. Mature applicants may get exemption from some requirements if they have relevant experience, eg at technician level in horticulture, botany etc.</p> <p><strong> And then wham! Tote that island, shift that hill. </strong>The recognised qualification for landscape architects is Member of the Landscape Institute (MLI). To get this you must get Associate membership of the institute, having gained two years' practical experience, at least, and then you have got to pass the Institute's professional exam.</p> <p> \u0095 The Landscape Institute, 6/8 Barnard Mews, London,SW11 1QU Telephone 0207 738 9166 <br> \u0095 Association of Landscape Management, Wiltshire Direct Services, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, BA14 8JH, Telephone: 01225 771670, Fax: 01225 751325 <br>\u0095 Society for Landscape Studies, Wrexham County Museum, County Building, Regents street, Wrexham, LL11 1RB, Telephone: 01978 358916, Fax: 01978 353882 <br> learndirect 0800 100900 may be able to give further information and advice on courses.</p>",

Mr Haider compares his own nationalist party with New Labour, claiming that both he and the British prime minister defy the traditional labels of right and left. Writing in today's Daily Telegraph, he argues that he takes a more moderate line than Mr Blair on the question of immigration and asylum seekers. While Mr Haider's Freedom party has called for a halt to immigration to allow the \"integration\" of foreigners already in Austria, he claims his policy is \"less tough\" than the Blair government's. He writes: \"Are Blair and Labour extreme right because they do not accept the Schengen [EU open borders] agreement and advocate stricter rules on immigration? If Blair is not extreme then nor is Haider. \"The latter is arguably less tough on asylum seekers and immigrants than Labour and Blair.\" Mr Haider rose to international prominence earlier this month when his party joined a new coalition government with Austria's conservative People's party, after winning 27% of the vote in last year's general election. The coalition was greeted with widespread protests within Austria and condemnation from the EU and around the world over his extreme nationalistic views. But Mr Haider claims in the article - in which he extensively quotes the Labour leader - that his party, like Mr Blair's, is committed to social justice and finding \"a new sense of community\". A Downing Street spokesman last night dismissed Mr Haider's comments: \"The idea that there are genuine similarities between the two is so risible that I do not think it is worth wasting our breath.\" Mr Haider claims the similarities are extensive, with both parties looking for solutions in a \"globalised world\" and free of \"ideological ballast\". \"The once dogmatic left Labour party and the right-nationalist FPO of old have undergone an ideological metamorphosis,\" he writes. Both parties have abandoned their anti-European stances, and adopted a \"positive attitude to Europe\", he claims. The Freedom party no longer holds its \"German nationalist stance\" but has become an \"Austrian patriotic movement\". He adds: \"Both parties stand up for the weak and underprivileged.\" Mr Haider, who has also been criticised for praising the Nazi employment programme, draws parallels between his own party's employment policies and Mr Blair's. Both the Freedom and Labour parties, he writes, believe the jobless should not be \"encouraged to be inactive through state assistance but should be given jobs\". Echoing New Labour's pledge to create a stakeholder economy, Mr Haider discusses giving workers a stake in their companies and in the economy.",

The deal with AOL Europe, a joint venture between AOL and German media group Bertelsmann which has been the subject of speculation about a split, will provide online banking and brokerage services. Later this year Deutsche plans to launch net start-up investment funds in the US and Asia. An internet portal named Moneyshelf.com offering services from investment to insurance is also planned. Mr Breuer said yesterday that the bank would fund its investment programme from the capital gains realised by selling parts of its large portfolio of industrial investments. The German government has recently announced plans for the withdrawal of capital gains tax on the profits realised by companies from the sale of shares in other domestic firms, making it more attractive to businesses to liquidate their holdings - which are often of long standing. Competition in German retail banking is increasing rapidly. Recently both HypoVereinsbank and Commerzbank announced online initiatives - the former through a \u20ac100m investment programme and the latter through a portal deal with T-Online, the internet subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.",

But he also accused some sponsors of trying to turn their zones into \"closer to a trade show than what the editorial concept was designed to be\". The culture secretary, Chris Smith, admitted that there had been \"a few glitches\", but said that the overwhelming majority of the 700,000 people who had visited the dome had enjoyed their day. The dome had experienced its \"four best ever days of attendance\", he told MPs. On Friday, 27,000 people visited, on Saturday, 24,700 and Sunday 26,200. Yesterday tickets were sold out by 11.30am. Both Mr Smith and Mr Heseltine praised Jennie Page, who was ousted from her job as New Millennium Experience Company chief executive earlier this month. Opening the debate, the shadow culture secretary, Peter Ainsworth, claimed the dome had become a symbol of a \"trite, self-regarding and bossy government\", and ministers had failed to meet the nation's aspirations. The Tory motion was defeated by 275 votes to 141.",

      "body": "<p>The mother of a woman killed in the Paddington rail crash yesterday blamed inadequate safety measures for the death of her daughter, and demanded that the accident be the last of its kind on Britain's railways.</p> <p>Birgit Andersen told the jury on the opening day of the inquest into the deaths of the 31 accident victims that the crash could have been prevented.</p> <p>Her daughter Charlotte, 32, was among those killed when a three-coach Thames Turbo service from Paddington to Slough collided with a First Great Western train from Cheltenham travelling in the opposite direction. The Thames train is believed to have passed through a red signal shortly before the collision at Ladbroke Grove, two miles outside Paddington station.</p> <p>Mrs Andersen said: \"On the morning of October 5 1999 she [Charlotte] was killed in a crash which I believe could have been prevented. She lost her life due to lack of safety measures.</p> <p>\"Her sister, her father and I were robbed that morning at 8.11am. We feel angry as well as worried and feel it is a matter of time before more lives are lost in a similar accident if safety is not improved.</p> <p>\"I plead that the dead of Ladbroke Grove be honoured by ensuring that this does not happen again. We will never hear her voice again and we will never see her smile again,\" she said, before handing a picture of her daughter to the jury.</p> <p>Mrs Andersen, who flew from her home in Virginia in the US with her husband Per and youngest daughter Tina to give evidence to the inquest, added that she had thought her daughter would be safe in Britain.</p> <p>\"My daughter ... lived, studied, travelled and worked in many places around the world, including Europe and America, and many which I considered under-developed,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I used to worry about her safety but when she began to work in the United Kingdom three years ago I felt no need to worry. Then she commuted to work by Thames train from Paddington to Slough.\"</p> <p>Charlotte was living in Notting Hill, west London, and working as a product manager in Slough.</p> <p>She is thought to have been sitting in the front carriage of the Thames train. Her body was thrown from the carriage on impact.</p> <p>Speaking outside the court, Charlotte's father vowed to do everything in his power to ensure that \"the responsible authorities are brought to court\".</p> <p>Earlier the inquest heard from the first police and fire officers to arrive at the scene. Detective Superintendent Patrick Bracken, the senior investigating officer, said that the two trains collided when the Thames train attempted to join the down main line heading away from London, crossing the path of the Great Western train.</p> <p>The combined impact speed was around 100mph, he said.</p> <p>Fireman Richard Hodson, chief of North Kensington fire station, said that the first two fire engines at the scene were prevented from getting to the crash site by an electronic security fence protecting a Eurostar depot alongside the track.</p> <p>He scaled the fence and ran down to the wreckage, where he found a scene of devastation.</p> <p>In a statement read to the inquest by the coroner, Paul Knapman, Mr Hodson said: \"I was confronted with a situation the enormity of which took my breath away.\"</p> <p>In total, 228 people were sent to hospital and 296 received first aid at the scene. Some 319 police officers from the Metropolitan and British Transport police attended the scene, along with 152 firefighters and 31 ambulances and 20 other vehicles and crews from the ambulance service.</p> <p>Dr Knapman indicated the inquest was likely to be adjourned after evidence regarding the death of all 31 victims. Lord Cullen's inquiry into the crash is due to begin hearing evidence next month, and an investigation by British Transport police is continuing.</p> <p>The inquest continues today. <br><br><b>Hearing told how eight were killed</b><br><br>Yesterday the inquest heard details of the deaths of eight of the people killed in the crash:</p> <p><b> Khawar Tauheed, 44</b></p> <p>A microbiologist, Dr Tauheed was born in Pakistan and moved to Britain in 1986.

      "bodyText": "The mother of a woman killed in the Paddington rail crash yesterday blamed inadequate safety measures for the death of her daughter, and demanded that the accident be the last of its kind on Britain's railways. Birgit Andersen told the jury on the opening day of the inquest into the deaths of the 31 accident victims that the crash could have been prevented. Her daughter Charlotte, 32, was among those killed when a three-coach Thames Turbo service from Paddington to Slough collided with a First Great Western train from Cheltenham travelling in the opposite direction. The Thames train is believed to have passed through a red signal shortly before the collision at Ladbroke Grove, two miles outside Paddington station. Mrs Andersen said: \"On the morning of October 5 1999 she [Charlotte] was killed in a crash which I believe could have been prevented. She lost her life due to lack of safety measures. \"Her sister, her father and I were robbed that morning at 8.11am. We feel angry as well as worried and feel it is a matter of time before more lives are lost in a similar accident if safety is not improved. \"I plead that the dead of Ladbroke Grove be honoured by ensuring that this does not happen again. We will never hear her voice again and we will never see her smile again,\" she said, before handing a picture of her daughter to the jury. Mrs Andersen, who flew from her home in Virginia in the US with her husband Per and youngest daughter Tina to give evidence to the inquest, added that she had thought her daughter would be safe in Britain. \"My daughter ... lived, studied, travelled and worked in many places around the world, including Europe and America, and many which I considered under-developed,\" she said. \"I used to worry about her safety but when she began to work in the United Kingdom three years ago I felt no need to worry. Then she commuted to work by Thames train from Paddington to Slough.\" Charlotte was living in Notting Hill, west London, and working as a product manager in Slough. She is thought to have been sitting in the front carriage of the Thames train. Her body was thrown from the carriage on impact. Speaking outside the court, Charlotte's father vowed to do everything in his power to ensure that \"the responsible authorities are brought to court\". Earlier the inquest heard from the first police and fire officers to arrive at the scene. Detective Superintendent Patrick Bracken, the senior investigating officer, said that the two trains collided when the Thames train attempted to join the down main line heading away from London, crossing the path of the Great Western train. The combined impact speed was around 100mph, he said. Fireman Richard Hodson, chief of North Kensington fire station, said that the first two fire engines at the scene were prevented from getting to the crash site by an electronic security fence protecting a Eurostar depot alongside the track. He scaled the fence and ran down to the wreckage, where he found a scene of devastation. In a statement read to the inquest by the coroner, Paul Knapman, Mr Hodson said: \"I was confronted with a situation the enormity of which took my breath away.\" In total, 228 people were sent to hospital and 296 received first aid at the scene. Some 319 police officers from the Metropolitan and British Transport police attended the scene, along with 152 firefighters and 31 ambulances and 20 other vehicles and crews from the ambulance service. Dr Knapman indicated the inquest was likely to be adjourned after evidence regarding the death of all 31 victims. Lord Cullen's inquiry into the crash is due to begin hearing evidence next month, and an investigation by British Transport police is continuing. The inquest continues today. Hearing told how eight were killed Yesterday the inquest heard details of the deaths of eight of the people killed in the crash: Khawar Tauheed, 44 A microbiologist, Dr Tauheed was born in Pakistan and moved to Britain in 1986. He was married with two children and was travelling in the front carriage of the Thames train. Cause of death: Head injuries and smoke inhalation. Death was instantaneous. Anthony Beeton, 47 Married with two children, Mr Beeton was an adviser to Mo Mowlam at the Northern Ireland office. He boarded the Great Western train at Didcot, and took his normal seat in a rear carriage. On the approach to Paddington, as he did every morning, he walked to the front of the train. His body was thrown from the front coach into the power car. Cause of death: Head and pelvic injuries. Death instantaneous. John Northcott, 24 Mr Northcott, an IT consultant from Leyton, was in the front carriage of the Thames train heading to Slough. Cause of death: Multiple head injuries. \"He suffered a form of brain damage,\" said pathologist Iain West. Charlotte Andersen, 32 Ms Andersen was in the front carriage of the Thames train, and was thrown onto the tracks. Cause of death: Multiple injuries. Death instantaneous. Sean Donoghue, 45 A statistician from New Cross, Mr Donoghue was also on the Thames train. Cause of death: Multiple injuries. Derek Antonowitz, 25 A computer consultant born in Harare, Mr Antonowitz had been in Britain three months when he died on the Thames train. Cause of death: Injuries to head, chest and abdomen. Ola Bratlie, 26 A Norwegian telecommunications engineer living in north-west London, she was also on board the Thames train. Cause of death: Multiple injuries. Death instantaneous. Delroy Manning, 39 A plasterer from Lewisham, Mr Manning was married with two children. He had been travelling to a new job he was due to start that morning in Ealing, west London. He was knocked out and thrown from the train on impact. Cause of death: Head and chest injuries.",

Why should I continue giving up my spare time if party democracy is a sham? Why should I campaign for Millbank's poodle?<br><b> David Pope </b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 As a member of the Welsh Labour party, I am only too familiar with how Ken Livingstone and the London Labour membership have been cheated by the leadership. However, it would be a grave error for Livingstone to stand as an independent candidate. Apart from the fact that the party is bigger than any individual, it would be a gift for the Tories and an opportunity for the leadership to expel any active leftwingers involved in the campaign at a time when support for the left in the party and trade unions is growing significantly, as indicated by the vote for Ken among individual members of both the party and those trade unions that bothered to ballot their members in London. <b><br> Colin Penfold </b><br> Llanbrynmair, Powys</p> <p>\u0095 Does Tony Blair really imagine that the many thousands of non-militant Labour party members who voted for Livingstone will weakly accept their disenfranchisement? I'm not sure whether urging party members tactically to abstain in the general election is an expellable offence, but a quick telephone poll of my fellow moderates suggests that most see that as being Blair's Nemesis. <br><b> G Colin Jimack </b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 Mr Livingstone cannot, with integrity, stand as an independent candidate after his public undertakings not to do so. But a massive \"write-in\" of his name in the final ballot would invalidate this absurd and tawdry election quite beautifully, wouldn't it? <br><b> Peter Regent </b><br> Newport-on-Tay, Fife</p> <p>\u0095 On my Labour party membership card it reads \"...all of us a community in which power... in the hands of the many not the few\". Why then, when the many delegated that power to Ken Livingstone, did the few go against Labour's 100-year-old philosophy and tell them that they were wrong? <b><br>Matthew Bishop </b><br>Sheffield <br>HIA99MLB@Sheffield.ac.uk</p> <p>\u0095 This undemocratic stitch-up is not just an attack on Ken Livingstone, but on the overwhelming majority of the Labour party in London who have seen their candidate blocked. All Blair and Dobbo have achieved through this is the demoralisation of the party, which will probably see our lame-duck candidate beaten by the Tories, as no one will be willing to do any work in the election for him. I just hope Dobbo \"amazes us\" by doing the decent thing and resigning, to undo the damage done by the Millbank tendency. <b><br>Graham Copp </b><br>London <br>coppgd@sbu.ac.uk</p> <p>\u0095 I was phoned by the chair of our constituency Labour party last week and asked to canvass for the May elections. What should my answer be now, after the grotesque spectacle of a Labour government rigging an election? This is not just an issue for London, but for all party members, who have to work out if they can stand in doorways over the coming months wearing a Labour badge on their jackets. And will those Labour posters in our windows tell the whole world what frauds we all are?<br><b>Jeremy Harmer </b><br> Cambridge <br>Jeremy.Harmer@btinternet.com</p> <p>\u0095 Now that the process of selecting Labour's mayoral candidate has been completed, some of us are wondering about the government's preferred system of electing MPs. I have an idea that Tony Blair will favour last past the post. <br><b> Pater Banks </b><br> Sale<br> pebanks89@talk21.com</p> <p>\u0095 In Iran the reformist party can win 60% of the popular vote and gain a parliamentary majority. In Britain Ken Livingstone can win 60% of the popular vote and lose'. Perhaps Ken should stand as the next democratically elected mayor of Tehran? <br><b> Alex Windscheffel </b><br> Egham, Surrey <br> a.windscheffel@virgin.net</p> <p>\u0095 Not long before he died, John Smith was seen on television saying, \"the opportunity to serve, that is all we ask\". Compared with that, New Labour is a travesty, a disgrace, as Livingstone and all who voted for his candidacy are no doubt contemplating. We, like Scotland and Wales before us, are on the receiving end of a big, ripe raspberry from Blair and his machine.<b><br>John Robinson</b><br> London</p>",

David Pope London \u0095 As a member of the Welsh Labour party, I am only too familiar with how Ken Livingstone and the London Labour membership have been cheated by the leadership. However, it would be a grave error for Livingstone to stand as an independent candidate. Apart from the fact that the party is bigger than any individual, it would be a gift for the Tories and an opportunity for the leadership to expel any active leftwingers involved in the campaign at a time when support for the left in the party and trade unions is growing significantly, as indicated by the vote for Ken among individual members of both the party and those trade unions that bothered to ballot their members in London. Colin Penfold Llanbrynmair, Powys \u0095 Does Tony Blair really imagine that the many thousands of non-militant Labour party members who voted for Livingstone will weakly accept their disenfranchisement? I'm not sure whether urging party members tactically to abstain in the general election is an expellable offence, but a quick telephone poll of my fellow moderates suggests that most see that as being Blair's Nemesis. G Colin Jimack London \u0095 Mr Livingstone cannot, with integrity, stand as an independent candidate after his public undertakings not to do so. But a massive \"write-in\" of his name in the final ballot would invalidate this absurd and tawdry election quite beautifully, wouldn't it? Peter Regent Newport-on-Tay, Fife \u0095 On my Labour party membership card it reads \"...all of us a community in which power... in the hands of the many not the few\". Why then, when the many delegated that power to Ken Livingstone, did the few go against Labour's 100-year-old philosophy and tell them that they were wrong? Matthew Bishop Sheffield HIA99MLB@Sheffield.ac.uk \u0095 This undemocratic stitch-up is not just an attack on Ken Livingstone, but on the overwhelming majority of the Labour party in London who have seen their candidate blocked. All Blair and Dobbo have achieved through this is the demoralisation of the party, which will probably see our lame-duck candidate beaten by the Tories, as no one will be willing to do any work in the election for him. I just hope Dobbo \"amazes us\" by doing the decent thing and resigning, to undo the damage done by the Millbank tendency. Graham Copp London coppgd@sbu.ac.uk \u0095 I was phoned by the chair of our constituency Labour party last week and asked to canvass for the May elections. What should my answer be now, after the grotesque spectacle of a Labour government rigging an election? This is not just an issue for London, but for all party members, who have to work out if they can stand in doorways over the coming months wearing a Labour badge on their jackets. And will those Labour posters in our windows tell the whole world what frauds we all are? Jeremy Harmer Cambridge Jeremy.Harmer@btinternet.com \u0095 Now that the process of selecting Labour's mayoral candidate has been completed, some of us are wondering about the government's preferred system of electing MPs. I have an idea that Tony Blair will favour last past the post. Pater Banks Sale pebanks89@talk21.com \u0095 In Iran the reformist party can win 60% of the popular vote and gain a parliamentary majority. In Britain Ken Livingstone can win 60% of the popular vote and lose'. Perhaps Ken should stand as the next democratically elected mayor of Tehran? Alex Windscheffel Egham, Surrey a.windscheffel@virgin.net \u0095 Not long before he died, John Smith was seen on television saying, \"the opportunity to serve, that is all we ask\". Compared with that, New Labour is a travesty, a disgrace, as Livingstone and all who voted for his candidacy are no doubt contemplating. We, like Scotland and Wales before us, are on the receiving end of a big, ripe raspberry from Blair and his machine. John Robinson London",

Clare Abbott Oxford \u0095 I hope that if readers follow Simon Regan's example and make cannabis cake (By golly, it's good, February 9; Letters, February 17) they also take note that he told his friend to whom he gave it \"exactly what it was\". My daughter unknowingly consumed cannabis cake at a party and was made extremely ill. She had to drive home with her toddler daughter, where she was reduced to crawling round the floor to reach the telephone to summon help. Mary E Webster Exeter \u0095 Catherine Bennett (February 17) rejects a political solution to the conflict in Ireland and praises Lord Tennyson's suggestion that the island be towed into the middle of the Atlantic. Surely, if prior to the 11th century Britain had been towed beyond the Arctic Circle Ireland would not have suffered centuries of mayhem and misrule. However, given the fact that England was determined to subjugate its nearest neighbour we might well now be looking at the breakdown of the peace process in Greenland. John Morgan Luton \u0095 Roy Hattersley (A boost for the bard, February 21) does not think much of Burns or Sir Walter Scott. What, I wonder, would they think of the author of such classics as Buster's Diaries? Stephen Higgins Staines, Middx",

      "bodyText": "Nato-led troops fired volleys of tear gas and used batons to disperse angry Albanian protesters yesterday after thousands of marchers broke an agreement not to advance on the main bridge in Kosovo's divided city of Mitrovice. The huge build-up of demonstrators, who pushed through a flimsy cordon to reach the bridge, brought tension to its highest point since 10 people were murdered two and a half weeks ago. Loudspeakers across the river on the Serb side played nationalist songs to taunt the crowd. Mitrovice has become the worst flashpoint in the unfinished war in Kosovo. When troops from the Nato-led international peace force, K-For, arrived last June they promised to defuse the tension. The clashes between protesters and peacekeepers yes terday lasted for more than an hour but subsided towards evening, by which time most of the crowd had dispersed. The commander of the Kosovo contingent of Britain's Royal Greenjackets, Lieutenant-Colonel Nick Carter, appealed to the crowd for calm. \"Please, let the British stay where we are,\" he said from the top of an armoured car. \"Don't push us. Please stay where you are.\" He estimated the size of the crowd stretching back from the bridge at 60,000-70,000.

The equal opportunities commission, which also supports pay audits, called for legal reform to streamline the cumbersome employment tribunal process and make it easier for women to bring equal pay cases. Research revealed yesterday confirmed that the pay gap between women and men stands at around 20%, with women paying a heavy price simply for being female. A professional woman graduate, for example, will earn \u00a3143,000 less than an equivalent man over a lifetime, even before she has children.

The ministers for women Lady Jay and Tessa Jowell yesterday acknowledged that women were still hit by a \"female forfeit\" and said the report - Women's Incomes over the Lifetime - exploded longstanding \"myths\" that women's incomes were lower than men's because they took time off to have children.

      "body": "<p>The patient - a society that wastes female talent and prices caring at next to nothing - has, of course, been sickly for a long time. But now the government's women's unit has published a study that ought to speed the provision of a radical cure. So what should Doctor Blair do?</p> <p>According to research conducted for the unit by the London School of Economics, a woman who chooses not to have children and competes \"equally\" with men will still earn \u00a3100,000 less over a lifetime. If you're a mother, the forfeit is up to \u00a3250,000. A woman with GCSEs will \"lose\" \u00a350,000 more than one with no qualifications. A low-skilled woman with two children will earn half a million less than her husband.</p> <p>A sack full of recent statistics, apart from the LSE's research, paints a picture of inequality that is nothing short of scandalous. What's even more troubling is the frustration of the hope that better-educated females would expedite change. In the 1960s, women made up 25% of undergraduates; now that figure is 52%. In 1975, the 10% of top female earners received 59.7% of male colleagues' salaries; by last year, that had crawled up to 62.7%. High-flyers have done little to dent the attitude that they are worth infinitely less than men - not because they have children but because they might.</p> <p>According to research conducted by the Greater Manchester Low Pay Unit in 1999, women's earnings increased at a marginally faster rate than men's as a result of the national minimum wage. Still, 25 years after the abysmal Equal Pay Act was passed, women earn less than three- quarters of men's full-time weekly earnings. Part-time women earn 60%.</p> <p>\"Women often work flexible, unsocial hours for a basic rate,\" points out Mary-Anne Stephenson of campaigning women's group the Fawcett Society. \"Men work flexibly, too, but it's called shift work and overtime, and they are paid extra.\"</p> <p>A man in manual work earns, on average, \u00a3335 per week, a woman \u00a3221. In non-manual employment, a man earns \u00a3525, a woman \u00a3346. Whichever way you shake the wages kaleidoscope, women are the losers. More than a quarter of full-time female workers earn less than \u00a3220 per week - that applies to only one in 10 men. Even in the higher-earning, male-dominated sectors, male administrators are paid \u00a316.78 per hour, women \u00a312.19. Identical job, different gender.</p> <p>What's the result? Six out of 10 of those without access to a bank account are women; female incomes, in retirement, are half those of men. Only one in three part-timers has an occupational pension; five times as many women as men depend on income support in retirement.</p> <p>Elaine Kempson of Bristol University's Personal Finance Research Centre has asked women why they don't make better provision for their old age. \"They say: too young, too poor or too late.\"</p> <p>Once upon a time, women's attitude to making provision for the future was that Prince Charming would provide. Now they can get caught on a different hook. Jan Pahl, professor of social policy at Kent University and author of Marriage And Money, says: \"Younger women are reared on the idea that they need to look after themselves. Even if they live with someone, they have their own income. But what happens when the baby or divorce comes along? Is his income hers too?\"</p> <p>The government has launched a range of proposals including the working family tax credit and, in next month's budget, an integrated child credit. All are important to boosting incomes, especially those of the poorest, but at heart they continue to shore up a system in which employers pay too little and caring is cut-price. And they ignore a culture in which part-time work offers no appropriate use of qualifications and no training; 90% of mothers working part-time say they don't want a full-time job - but does that also mean they have to put their brains on ice?</p> <p>Anthony Giddens, interpreter of the mysterious Third Way, recently said: \"We should develop a more dynamic conception of equality, placing more stress on opportunity.\" \"Opportunity\" is not gender neutral. It means little until women are compensated rather than penalised for combining the roles of parent, carer and employee.</p> <p>So what might make a difference? A requirement on all employers to implement a part-time charter offering advancement not staganation, including the right to return to the same job after childbirth, but as a part-timer. A remodelling of National Insurance. A high-profile, Tony Blair-led equal pay offensive - a recognition that women's contribution to society may be different from men's but is no less valuable.</p> <p>So far, the government has rejected both an overhaul of the Equal Pay Act and the EOC's suggestion that government suppliers and the public sector should set equal pay standards, while all companies should be obliged in law to implement pay audits. On National Insurance paid on wages of \u00a366 or more, research indicates that many don't understand that if they fail to pay it, they will be ineligible for benefits.</p> <p>Ignorance is only part of the problem. If you are one of half a million women who have two part-time jobs, if, say, each pays \u00a330, for a total of 15 hours per week, you will be unable to make a contribution towards a state pension. In contrast, a high-paid woman working only five hours and earning \u00a370 will be able to contribute. Gabrielle Cox of the Low Pay Unit suggests contributions are paid on a minimum number of hours worked, not wages, thus opening up benefits to many more.</p> <p>Jay Ginn, a pensions expert at Surrey University, also points out that a single woman who has saved modestly and has a small second pension could find herself disqualified from a number of benefits and worse off than the person who hasn't saved a penny. Ginn suggests a much higher earnings-related basic pension (now \u00a366.75) and a gentler taper. In Denmark, the basic pension of \u00a3110 is paid regardless of a partner's income or home-time for child-rearing. Its criteria is 40 years' residence. Such individualised benefits (rare here) help women.</p> <p>The new stakeholder pension, for those earning between \u00a39,000 and \u00a320,000, contains problems but it will permit a woman to continue to pay into her pension, tax free, even when she has time out from work, for instance when she has a child. Why can't the government extend the principle and offer help with that pension contribution, as it does with some maternity payments?</p> <p>Of course, in addition, women have to acquire the balls to ask for more. American labour organisation the AFL-CIO has a website through which an employee supplies her qualifications, experience and job - and is told how much less she earns than her male colleagues. Bolshiness helps - but, as our women's ministers have pointed out, it's the system that sucks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The patient - a society that wastes female talent and prices caring at next to nothing - has, of course, been sickly for a long time. But now the government's women's unit has published a study that ought to speed the provision of a radical cure. So what should Doctor Blair do? According to research conducted for the unit by the London School of Economics, a woman who chooses not to have children and competes \"equally\" with men will still earn \u00a3100,000 less over a lifetime. If you're a mother, the forfeit is up to \u00a3250,000. A woman with GCSEs will \"lose\" \u00a350,000 more than one with no qualifications. A low-skilled woman with two children will earn half a million less than her husband. A sack full of recent statistics, apart from the LSE's research, paints a picture of inequality that is nothing short of scandalous. What's even more troubling is the frustration of the hope that better-educated females would expedite change. In the 1960s, women made up 25% of undergraduates; now that figure is 52%. In 1975, the 10% of top female earners received 59.7% of male colleagues' salaries; by last year, that had crawled up to 62.7%. High-flyers have done little to dent the attitude that they are worth infinitely less than men - not because they have children but because they might. According to research conducted by the Greater Manchester Low Pay Unit in 1999, women's earnings increased at a marginally faster rate than men's as a result of the national minimum wage. Still, 25 years after the abysmal Equal Pay Act was passed, women earn less than three- quarters of men's full-time weekly earnings. Part-time women earn 60%. \"Women often work flexible, unsocial hours for a basic rate,\" points out Mary-Anne Stephenson of campaigning women's group the Fawcett Society. \"Men work flexibly, too, but it's called shift work and overtime, and they are paid extra.\" A man in manual work earns, on average, \u00a3335 per week, a woman \u00a3221. In non-manual employment, a man earns \u00a3525, a woman \u00a3346. Whichever way you shake the wages kaleidoscope, women are the losers. More than a quarter of full-time female workers earn less than \u00a3220 per week - that applies to only one in 10 men. Even in the higher-earning, male-dominated sectors, male administrators are paid \u00a316.78 per hour, women \u00a312.19. Identical job, different gender. What's the result? Six out of 10 of those without access to a bank account are women; female incomes, in retirement, are half those of men. Only one in three part-timers has an occupational pension; five times as many women as men depend on income support in retirement. Elaine Kempson of Bristol University's Personal Finance Research Centre has asked women why they don't make better provision for their old age. \"They say: too young, too poor or too late.\" Once upon a time, women's attitude to making provision for the future was that Prince Charming would provide. Now they can get caught on a different hook. Jan Pahl, professor of social policy at Kent University and author of Marriage And Money, says: \"Younger women are reared on the idea that they need to look after themselves. Even if they live with someone, they have their own income. But what happens when the baby or divorce comes along? Is his income hers too?\" The government has launched a range of proposals including the working family tax credit and, in next month's budget, an integrated child credit. All are important to boosting incomes, especially those of the poorest, but at heart they continue to shore up a system in which employers pay too little and caring is cut-price. And they ignore a culture in which part-time work offers no appropriate use of qualifications and no training; 90% of mothers working part-time say they don't want a full-time job - but does that also mean they have to put their brains on ice? Anthony Giddens, interpreter of the mysterious Third Way, recently said: \"We should develop a more dynamic conception of equality, placing more stress on opportunity.\" \"Opportunity\" is not gender neutral. It means little until women are compensated rather than penalised for combining the roles of parent, carer and employee. So what might make a difference? A requirement on all employers to implement a part-time charter offering advancement not staganation, including the right to return to the same job after childbirth, but as a part-timer. A remodelling of National Insurance. A high-profile, Tony Blair-led equal pay offensive - a recognition that women's contribution to society may be different from men's but is no less valuable. So far, the government has rejected both an overhaul of the Equal Pay Act and the EOC's suggestion that government suppliers and the public sector should set equal pay standards, while all companies should be obliged in law to implement pay audits. On National Insurance paid on wages of \u00a366 or more, research indicates that many don't understand that if they fail to pay it, they will be ineligible for benefits. Ignorance is only part of the problem. If you are one of half a million women who have two part-time jobs, if, say, each pays \u00a330, for a total of 15 hours per week, you will be unable to make a contribution towards a state pension. In contrast, a high-paid woman working only five hours and earning \u00a370 will be able to contribute. Gabrielle Cox of the Low Pay Unit suggests contributions are paid on a minimum number of hours worked, not wages, thus opening up benefits to many more. Jay Ginn, a pensions expert at Surrey University, also points out that a single woman who has saved modestly and has a small second pension could find herself disqualified from a number of benefits and worse off than the person who hasn't saved a penny. Ginn suggests a much higher earnings-related basic pension (now \u00a366.75) and a gentler taper. In Denmark, the basic pension of \u00a3110 is paid regardless of a partner's income or home-time for child-rearing. Its criteria is 40 years' residence. Such individualised benefits (rare here) help women. The new stakeholder pension, for those earning between \u00a39,000 and \u00a320,000, contains problems but it will permit a woman to continue to pay into her pension, tax free, even when she has time out from work, for instance when she has a child. Why can't the government extend the principle and offer help with that pension contribution, as it does with some maternity payments? Of course, in addition, women have to acquire the balls to ask for more. American labour organisation the AFL-CIO has a website through which an employee supplies her qualifications, experience and job - and is told how much less she earns than her male colleagues. Bolshiness helps - but, as our women's ministers have pointed out, it's the system that sucks.",

We believe that a civilised society accepts that women are creatures with a moral conscience, capable of making responsible decisions for themselves. This is as true for women who seek late abortions as it is for women in early pregnancy. Women do not request abortion because they are ignorant about foetal development but because, for some reason, they find their pregnancy intolerable.</p> <p>Science may be making new discoveries about foetal development, but it has little to tell us about the real lives of women. The issue is not so much whether or when the embryo/foetus is deserving of respect per se, but how much respect and value we accord to a life (that does not even know it is alive) relative to the respect and value we have for the life of the woman who carries it.</p> <p>Some argue that civilised society can be judged by its attitude to the \"unborn child\".

He claims the case for liberal provision of early abortion is strengthened by evidence that the natural termination of potential life is far more common than previously assumed - but scientific discoveries about the brain activity of the more developed foetus stand as an argument against late abortion. Easterbrook believes this is a message the pro-choice movement does not want to hear lest they be compelled to trade off liberal earlier abortion for restrictions on those in later pregnancy. Those of us who provide abortion services cannot afford to insulate ourselves from contemporary debates. For example, it is not uncommon for women seeking to end a pregnancy to be concerned about whether a procedure causes pain to the foetus. Our clinicians would be failing their profession if they were not aware of developments in neo-natal medicine. Because of the need for open debate, British Pregnancy Advisory Service hosted a meeting in London yesterday of almost 100 clinicians, academics, policy makers and campaigners, including those hostile to abortion, to consider the \"new ethics\" of abortion. Each year we provide nearly 55,000 abortions - most are in early pregnancy, but some are late. We see no need for apology or moral defensiveness. Rather we believe there is a strong case for trying to wrest the moral imperative away from those who assume they have the monopoly on ethical concerns. Within the confines of the law we strive to allow women to exercise \"procreative autonomy\", that is to assert their own control over if and when they have children. We believe that a civilised society accepts that women are creatures with a moral conscience, capable of making responsible decisions for themselves. This is as true for women who seek late abortions as it is for women in early pregnancy. Women do not request abortion because they are ignorant about foetal development but because, for some reason, they find their pregnancy intolerable. Science may be making new discoveries about foetal development, but it has little to tell us about the real lives of women. The issue is not so much whether or when the embryo/foetus is deserving of respect per se, but how much respect and value we accord to a life (that does not even know it is alive) relative to the respect and value we have for the life of the woman who carries it. Some argue that civilised society can be judged by its attitude to the \"unborn child\". We believe it can also be judged by its attitude to women. \u0095 Ann Furedi is director of communications, British Pregnancy Advisory Service",

Like hotels and catering businesses across the country it is suffering a recruitment shortage.</p> <p>There are in excess of 100,000 vacancies within the industry and many of them look like they will remain empty for a very long time.</p> <p>This week the Langham Hilton hotel has 308 staff, down from 320 last week and well below the desirable figure of 356. And that is in a hotel with a much lower turnover than a number of its rivals.</p> <p>The hotel needs a sales person, two engineers, a telephonist, four concierge staff, two waiters for its Palm Court restaurant, one bartender, three people to work in conference banqueting, five kitchen staff, eight stewarding staff and six valet parkers.</p> <p>Prospective employees can afford to be fussy. Unemployment in Britain is at its lowest for 20 years and many forecasters say it will drop below 1m for the first time since 1975, while the number of people in work is at an all-time high of 27.5m.</p> <p>Instead of working in a business which is perceived as low-paid and stressful, job hunters are opting for reasonably well-paid jobs in call centres and on supermarket tills.</p> <p>This inevitably means there are fewer people around to provide the levels of service required by an ever more discerning customer. Hotels admit that it will not be long before guests start complaining.</p> <p>A report by the Hospitality Training Foundation says that the industry advertised 104,200 positions in job centres across the country in the three months to July 1999, with 44% remaining unfilled.</p> <p>\"This is likely to represent only one third of the vacancies, given that hospitality employers also use recruitment agencies, trade and local press and word of mouth to attract new employees,\" says the report.</p> <p>The office of national statistics estimates there are now 1,377,000 jobs in the sector, compared with 989,000 in 1987.</p> <p>Andy Westwood, director of development at the employment policy institute, believes that the estimates of 100,000 vacant jobs could be \"slightly conservative\", which he says proves that scaremongering over the introduction of the national minimum wage was groundless. The industry is finding it has to pay more.</p> <p>Westwood points to what he calls the industry's star performers, such as the coffee bars that have opened over the past year and taken staff away from the larger hotels.</p> <p>\"The cappuccino economy has really taken off. Rather than go and be a silver service waiter in a big hotel, you can go and be a barista in Starbucks and become someone who knows which kind of coffee bean to grind for which coffee,\" he said. \"That's a recruitment tactic; they are paying a decent wage and they are trying to make it a skill to be in the service sector.\"</p> <p>Kevin Brett, executive assistant manager of the Langham, said: \"The hours are perceived as unsocial, the salaries and packages we are paying don't compare to the more glamorous and high paying vacancies elsewhere in London.\"</p> <p>Traditionally hotels have recruited around 70% of their staff from foreign nationals. But those with a good grip of the English language are turning to other jobs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The sign outside says Investors in People - which certifies that this place excels in the training and development of its staff - but it seems that the five-star Langham hotel, in central London, is lacking in the people to invest in. Like hotels and catering businesses across the country it is suffering a recruitment shortage. There are in excess of 100,000 vacancies within the industry and many of them look like they will remain empty for a very long time. This week the Langham Hilton hotel has 308 staff, down from 320 last week and well below the desirable figure of 356. And that is in a hotel with a much lower turnover than a number of its rivals. The hotel needs a sales person, two engineers, a telephonist, four concierge staff, two waiters for its Palm Court restaurant, one bartender, three people to work in conference banqueting, five kitchen staff, eight stewarding staff and six valet parkers. Prospective employees can afford to be fussy. Unemployment in Britain is at its lowest for 20 years and many forecasters say it will drop below 1m for the first time since 1975, while the number of people in work is at an all-time high of 27.5m. Instead of working in a business which is perceived as low-paid and stressful, job hunters are opting for reasonably well-paid jobs in call centres and on supermarket tills. This inevitably means there are fewer people around to provide the levels of service required by an ever more discerning customer. Hotels admit that it will not be long before guests start complaining. A report by the Hospitality Training Foundation says that the industry advertised 104,200 positions in job centres across the country in the three months to July 1999, with 44% remaining unfilled. \"This is likely to represent only one third of the vacancies, given that hospitality employers also use recruitment agencies, trade and local press and word of mouth to attract new employees,\" says the report. The office of national statistics estimates there are now 1,377,000 jobs in the sector, compared with 989,000 in 1987. Andy Westwood, director of development at the employment policy institute, believes that the estimates of 100,000 vacant jobs could be \"slightly conservative\", which he says proves that scaremongering over the introduction of the national minimum wage was groundless. The industry is finding it has to pay more. Westwood points to what he calls the industry's star performers, such as the coffee bars that have opened over the past year and taken staff away from the larger hotels. \"The cappuccino economy has really taken off. Rather than go and be a silver service waiter in a big hotel, you can go and be a barista in Starbucks and become someone who knows which kind of coffee bean to grind for which coffee,\" he said. \"That's a recruitment tactic; they are paying a decent wage and they are trying to make it a skill to be in the service sector.\" Kevin Brett, executive assistant manager of the Langham, said: \"The hours are perceived as unsocial, the salaries and packages we are paying don't compare to the more glamorous and high paying vacancies elsewhere in London.\" Traditionally hotels have recruited around 70% of their staff from foreign nationals. But those with a good grip of the English language are turning to other jobs.",

The real culprit is Britain's own increasingly \"low public tolerance towards playground accidents\", according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents' playground safety adviser, Peter Heseltine, yesterday. As long ago as 1979, a voluntary British safety standard set out to discourage bouncing see-saws. It recommended that seats should be stopped 203 mm (less than an inch) above the ground. Three years ago, with strong British backing, the EU standardisation committee urged a stricter limit of 230mm. Since then, inspectors have visited playgrounds suggesting that \"risk assessments\" be carried out if see-saws fail either or both standards. Compliance remains voluntary. But failure to observe the standards can be cited in a prosecution or civil action for damages brought by a parent after an accident. For Bledington parish council, that was enough. Yesterday its chairman, Graham Richardson, said: \"The see-saw is impossible to bring up to new standards. \"I just don't know where all these rules and regulations are going to end. It seems ridiculous to me.\" Mr Bolter, aged 75, said: \"I'm disgusted\".",

Aubrey Powell, 77, attacked Mark Lester, 71, with a file wrapped in a tea towel during the weekly dance held in Brent town hall, north London, last September. The attack put Mr Lester in hospital with a fractured nose, head injuries, and a fractured wrist. Yesterday Powell, of Stamford Hill, north London, was given an 18 months prison sentence, suspended for two years, at Harrow crown court in north-west London after pleading guilty to wounding with intent. He was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 compensation to his victim, which Powell agreed to pay at \u00a315 a week out of his pension. The row began last March at the afternoon tea dance, where the elderly ladies lined up on the left of the dance floor and the men on the right. The two men had known each other, by sight only, for about 30 years, attending the same dances on a regular basis, said Polly-Ann Comfort, prosecuting. Mr Lester accused Powell of sexually harrassing ladies at the dance. Powell told the court that, on that occasion, Mr Lester had given him a \"rabbit punch\" on the back of the head. Powell reported the attack to police; though no action was taken, officers attended one dance at Powell's insistence but there was no trouble. From then on Powell took the file to the dance to protect himself, said Kathryn Hirst, defending. She said he had once been attacked in his home by burglars, and this led him to fear for his safety and to arm himself \"to protect himself from this much bigger man [Mr Lester].\" The attack last September occurred when Powell saw Mr Lester enter the dance, Miss Comfort told the court. \"He anticipated Mr Lester's approach, thought he was going to attack him, and raised what looked like a rolled up newspaper before raining blows upon him.\" Judge Barrington Black told Powell: \"I don't think I have ever had to deal with a case of two 70-year-olds brawling over some remark made to a lady with whom the other person was dancing.\" Outside court afterward Powell said: \"[Mr Lester] said I was interfering with the ladies.

As the former Greater London council leader yesterday promised to \"listen to Londoners\" and the first polls showed him to be runaway favourite for mayor, it emerged that Mr Blair's most popular cabinet minister has agreed in principle to step in if Mr Dobson stands aside. The likelihood of Mr Livingstone going it alone after his defeat in Labour's widely criticised electoral college has increased after a secret meeting with the prime minister at Chequers on Saturday produced no government job offer or prospect of political accommodation. Ms Mowlam is regarded in Downing Street as Labour's most appealing vote-winner and a potential saviour if Mr Dobson finds himself trailing in the polls and the party leadership decides he has been irreparably damaged by allegations that he won the nomination through a stitch-up. The crisis strategy would not require a re-run of the Labour selection campaign. Downing Street advisers envisage that Mr Dobson would step down shortly before the start of the campaign in April, allowing the party's national executive to use emergency powers to install a replacement. The cabinet office minister is understood to have been willing to put her name forward for the mayoralty late last year, as her job in the Northern Ireland office came under threat.

He is said to have pressed Mr Blair to advise the former health secretary to stand down. \"I can't tell him what to do,\" Mr Blair retorted. A Downing Street spokesman insisted yesterday that Mr Livingstone was bound to abandon any idea about standing as an independent once it had become clear that no significant Labour figure or union would back him. But the first opinion poll of Londoners for the Evening Standard suggested yesterday that Mr Livingstone would get 50% of the vote if he stood as an independent, with Mr Dobson a poor second on 22%. Another telephone poll for Carlton TV's London Tonight showed that 93% of those who called thought the former GLC leader should stand as an independent after winning the majority of votes from party members and trade unionists but losing the nomination. John Prescott called on Mr Livingstone to \"stop whining\" about the electoral college system that defeated him and accept the outcome of the process.

Labour officials also downplayed the significance of the polls, insisting that Mr Livingstone's lead would melt away under the heat of a public contest with all three main parties' electoral machines. But if Mr Livingstone gets corroborating evidence from other polls, he is expected to declare his candidacy later this week or next, earning automatic expulsion from the party he joined 32 years ago in the process. Mr Dobson yesterday kicked off his first day as Labour's official mayoral candidate by making a symbolic break with the party's Millbank headquarters and declaring that he would \"not be having anybody else poking their nose\" in his campaign. As speculation continues about whether or not Labour will face an independent chal lenge from Mr Livingstone, the government meanwhile faces defeat tonight in the House of Lords, when the opposition parties plan to vote down its regulations for the mayoral contest due to take place in less than three months.

After the leaking of the report, solicitors acting for Gen Pinochet asked the attorney general's office to investigate. The report - commissioned by Jack Straw, the home secretary, to establish whether the general was fit enough to be extradited to Spain to face charges of human rights abuses - was leaked to newspapers in Spain and Chile last Tuesday night. The previous day three high court judges had ruled that the four states with outstanding extradition warrants against the general - Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland - were entitled to see the report, which carries the conclusions of three doctors who examined the general last month at Northwick Park hospital, north London.

Yesterday Spanish authorities expressed \"regret\" over the leaking of the report to Spanish newspapers, but denied any knowledge of how it happened. The home office wrote to the Madrid government after details from the confidential medical report were published within hours of their being handed over to Spanish officials on the orders of the high court. A home office spokesman said last night: \"After making inquiries, they [Spain] did not consider it possible to conclude that the leak to Spanish newspapers occurred in Spain. \"They have expressed regret for any difficulties caused as a result of the breach of confidence and the partial disclosure of the report.\" Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland have until 5pm today to make representations to the home secretary and his decision that he is \"minded\" to allow Gen Pinochet to return to Chile.",

The hearing is expected to take four days. Mr Fitzgerald said his challenge was to the legality of whole-life tariffs in general, as well as to the particular sentence imposed on Hindley. Parliament had given no authority for life detention based solely on the gravity of the crime, though it had intended that prisoners who were dangerous could be detained for life, he said. At the most it provided for a recommendation of minimum tariffs and did not contemplate a category of prisoner for whom release from prison on licence could not be contemplated, except in \"exceptional circumstances\".

The disclosures about Lennon's possible links with the IRA came after a US court order last weekend ordering the FBI to release two letters and notes from a phone conversation, which has raised the possibility that other secret files on Lennon may now be released. It was prompted by a 17-year campaign by the author and historian John Wiener, who tabled a legal request three years after Lennon's murder in 1980 for all US government documents on him. MI5 sent a file on Lennon to the FBI after the Nixon administration ordered an investigation into the former Beatle, who became a vocal opponent of the Vietnam war after moving to the US in the early 1970s.

The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, said: \"The government is committed to creating confidence in the use of IT so as to make electronic conveyancing a reality. \"By cutting the time of individual transactions, the time taken for chains could reduce dramatically. The technology could enable bottlenecks to be identified and show what has to happen to clear them.\" Ministers hope electronic conveyancing will become the norm, but those who want to use the traditional method will be free to do so. The lengthy process of conveyancing in England and Wales encourages tactics such as gazumping - sellers backing out when they get a higher offer - because the contract only becomes binding several weeks into the process after lengthy inquiries. A single database for local searches and other inquiries could cut the process by weeks. A pilot scheme is underway in Bristol to test the feasibility of sellers providing a pack with completed searches, rather than leaving it to the buyer. If this goes ahead, the pack could be provided electronically. The land registry already has a database of registered titles for 15m properties, which can be searched online. Under the plans, a property's new ownership would be registered without the need for paper. The lord chancellor's de partment said draft rules to abolish the need for written contracts would be published later this year, with legislation planned for the end of the year. But time would be needed for creation of a national electronic database of land information with comprehensive online search facilities. There was \"a long way to go.\" The adoption of the new technology by professionals and financial institutions would also take time. But the government was \"determined to foster an environment in which electronic communication will flourish\".",

      "body": "<p>George Carey is back in the news for two reasons. On Friday, he preached a lecture at Essex university which appeared to demand that politicians refrain from sex outside marriage, on pain of punishment by the media; and yesterday he let it be known, semi-officially, that he plans to remain in office for another three years, at the personal request of the Queen. She is, after all, one of the few figures in public life who both subscribes to and lives up to the traditional Christian morality he preaches. But the problem for the archbishop is not really that society as a whole has abandoned traditional Christian sexual morality; it is that most Christians have abandoned it too.</p> <p>Fifty years ago it was clear that the church stood for lifelong marriage, patriarchy, and heterosexuality. It is still retreating from all these positions, but at different speeds in different places; and the strains of this disjointed retreat are breaking up all the structures on which Dr Carey's prestige depends.</p> <p>He has been in office for 10 years now, and will probably stay for another five. There is some evidence that the hard core of support in the Church of England has stayed steady in his time in office: the number of people taking out covenants to their local churches has remained level at about 400,000. But every other number tells a story of brisk decline. The number of Anglican Sunday churchgoers has fallen - on official figures - from 1.14m to 950,000; of those that are left, perhaps 10% refuse to recognise women priests, and most of this minority consider themselves out of communion with Dr Carey, and would not accept the sacramental bread and wine from his hands. They are organised into Forward in Faith, a sort of church within the church, which has its own bishops, priests, and parishes. All it really shares with the official body is a pension fund, (though that is a powerful force for unity.)</p> <p>The net effect of this is that the number of people obliged to take notice of the Archbishop of Canterbury's opinions has shrunk by about a fifth since he took office. The church will also lose a third of its bishops in the House of Lords; at the same time, Tony Blair, who actually appoints the bishops, has treated some of Dr Carey's nominations with unprecedented contempt. The hysteria when Princess Diana died was a great spontaneous uprush of religious feeling - but instead of showing that England was ready for a Christian revival, it showed that folk religion today has almost nothing to do with Christianity. The contempt with which the BBC treats religious broadcasting does not arouse protests from anyone except the General Synod.</p> <p>Not much of this decline in power and influence is Dr Carey's fault. Much of it could be blamed on wider changes in European society which no church leader knows how to handle. But what he could make worse by his public performances, he has. He was probably the only man in English public life who thought it was a really cool thing to be associated with the dome, and struggled hard to be associated as prominently as possible with the opening ceremonies, where his performance was squirm-inducing. But so it had been, too, at the funeral of Diana; while his earlier clumsy attempts to mediate in the royal marriage had earned the distrust and dislike of both parties.</p> <p>In small groups, and sticking to a script he has prepared, he can be forceful and convincing. But when ever he improvises in front of a microphone the results are disastrous. The Daily Mail, which ought to be a natural ally, gave up on him after one particularly pompous and uncertain performance on the Today programme. The only journalists who have written with informed admiration of him are those who have watched him behaving like a vicar, not an archbishop.</p> <p>There is a rather bitter irony to all this. One of Dr Carey's constant themes, as anyone who has reached the last few pages of any his speeches will know, is that a great evil of our age is what he calls \"the privatisation of religion\". Yet throughout his career Christianity has drifted further and further from the mainstream of English public life until we now have an exceptionally religious prime minister who takes great care to keep his Christian beliefs private. And the organisational reforms into which Carey has put huge efforts have all tended to separate the Church of England from the other institutions with which it was entwined, such as parliament; and to make it into a distinct organisation run like a modern company, with bishops chosen for their managerial skills.</p> <p>The old church had conspicuous palaces it could not afford to run. The new church has bishops who live in modern executive-style homes and whose average mobile phone bill is \u00a33,000 a year; it advertises for dioce san spin doctors at a salary of \u00a340,000 to work with a \"communications department\" which suppressed its membership figures when they looked bad.</p> <p>It used to be said that the church was the only institution which existed primarily for the benefit of non-members. But this was an attitude which relied on a clergy who felt themselves part of the society around them and who were paid by the historic assets of the church, irrespective of their measurable performance. Now that the funds of the church go almost entirely to its pensions, the priests are paid fairly directly by their congregations.</p> <p>To be a practising Christian means increas ingly to be one who pays for the church, and this tends to sharpen the sense of commitment and separation from the outside world that congregations feel. This means every move towards acceptance of secular morality on such issues as the equality of women (a real problem for conservative evangelicals) and the remarriage of divorcees in church has to be balanced by some move to show that Christians are different and better; and that usually means being clear about the awfulness of gays.</p> <p>The battles over homosexuality that have continued throughout Dr Carey's period in office have been almost unique to the Anglican Communion. No other church has contin ued to fight the same battle for so long. One side or the other has elsewhere won fairly quickly. But in the Church of England and the wider Anglican Communion made up of the worldwide federation of churches, nothing ever seems to change. The two sides are locked in endless, unedifying combat.</p> <p>One reason is the sheer number of gay clergy in the Church of England and their seniority. The evangelicals may wish to be rid of them; and can certainly enforce public standards of marriage, celibacy, or at least discretion. But they have an awful lot of people to police. When Dr Carey took over the church some of its most senior bureaucrats were gay; one of his first episcopal appointments was an early victim of Outrage! and the (married) bishop he chose to remodel the church's government has a conviction for cottaging. The Archbishop of York famously declared to the BBC that his own sexuality was \"a grey area\". No wonder Dr Carey felt obliged to oppose section 28 and the lowering of the age of consent. Within the diocese of London, about a quarter of the priests are reckoned to be gay. It is no doubt a coincidence that London is one of the few dioceses where churchgoing is actually on the increase.</p> <p>It is also the diocese where the resistance to women priests is most concentrated. The Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, will not himself ordain women. And the battle over gays cannot be understood without understanding what a trauma the ordination of women was for the Church of England. Though there were issues of high principle involved, both sides in that battle privately liked to blame their opponents' intransigence on a homosexual agenda. \"Women at the altar and boys in bed\" is how one leading Anglo-Catholic bishop sums up the liberal programme; but many of the women priests regarded their opponents, with equal justice, as a bunch of hysterical old queens.</p> <p>So to many evangelicals, resistance to gay clergy was an essential trade-off for their support of women priests. In this country women bishops are still prohibited by law, but in America, where there have been women bishops for 10 years, the battle over gay clergy has become the last ditch for conservatives to fight in. The American civil war, in which the Southern, conservative side has summoned help from African and Asian evangelicals, has now destroyed any pretence that there is such a thing as an \"Anglican Communion\", which allows Dr Carey to call himself a world spiritual leader.</p> <p>There are supposed to be 80m Anglicans around the world who follow him, or as he told the United Nations once in a moment of unforgettably comic self-importance, \"I want to put it to you that the worldwide Anglican Communion - which numbers over 70m people and is growing fast - has very great potential as a player on the international scene\" It turns out that 25m of Dr Carey's followers are supposed to be found in England, a statistic reached by counting everyone in this country who was baptised Anglican and is not yet dead.</p> <p>Still, even if there are only 50m Anglicans around the world, that would be a powerful number if they were united about anything much. But the deep and bitter divisions over homosexuality came to a head last month in a curiously furtive ceremony in Singapore Cathedral when the Archbishops of Rwanda and Singapore consecrated a couple of \"missionary bishops\" for American congregations who will preach the pure word of hostility to gays. This is simple and formal schism, a declaration that they belong to a different church from that of the bishops of the official Anglican body.</p> <p>The joke is that Dr Carey's instincts are entirely on the side of the schismatics. His son Andrew is deputy editor of the Church of England Newspaper, a tiny weekly which is the house organ of the anti-gay forces. When the archbishop last week released a formal letter explaining that he cannot recognise the new bishops, it contained a passage suggesting that even though he must officially reprimand them, he would do so with his fingers crossed: \"I do not question... their own perception that the situation in the United States is so serious that this action could be justified.\"</p> <p>But here, as elsewhere, he can't be the decisive leader he pretends to be. To repudiate the official, liberal church in America would have the immediate effect of breaking up and probably bankrupting the Anglican Communion, just as a hard line on divorce and second marriages would drive numerous faithful Christians out of the church.</p>",

The evangelicals may wish to be rid of them; and can certainly enforce public standards of marriage, celibacy, or at least discretion. But they have an awful lot of people to police. When Dr Carey took over the church some of its most senior bureaucrats were gay; one of his first episcopal appointments was an early victim of Outrage! and the (married) bishop he chose to remodel the church's government has a conviction for cottaging. The Archbishop of York famously declared to the BBC that his own sexuality was \"a grey area\". No wonder Dr Carey felt obliged to oppose section 28 and the lowering of the age of consent. Within the diocese of London, about a quarter of the priests are reckoned to be gay. It is no doubt a coincidence that London is one of the few dioceses where churchgoing is actually on the increase. It is also the diocese where the resistance to women priests is most concentrated. The Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, will not himself ordain women. And the battle over gays cannot be understood without understanding what a trauma the ordination of women was for the Church of England. Though there were issues of high principle involved, both sides in that battle privately liked to blame their opponents' intransigence on a homosexual agenda. \"Women at the altar and boys in bed\" is how one leading Anglo-Catholic bishop sums up the liberal programme; but many of the women priests regarded their opponents, with equal justice, as a bunch of hysterical old queens. So to many evangelicals, resistance to gay clergy was an essential trade-off for their support of women priests. In this country women bishops are still prohibited by law, but in America, where there have been women bishops for 10 years, the battle over gay clergy has become the last ditch for conservatives to fight in. The American civil war, in which the Southern, conservative side has summoned help from African and Asian evangelicals, has now destroyed any pretence that there is such a thing as an \"Anglican Communion\", which allows Dr Carey to call himself a world spiritual leader. There are supposed to be 80m Anglicans around the world who follow him, or as he told the United Nations once in a moment of unforgettably comic self-importance, \"I want to put it to you that the worldwide Anglican Communion - which numbers over 70m people and is growing fast - has very great potential as a player on the international scene\" It turns out that 25m of Dr Carey's followers are supposed to be found in England, a statistic reached by counting everyone in this country who was baptised Anglican and is not yet dead. Still, even if there are only 50m Anglicans around the world, that would be a powerful number if they were united about anything much. But the deep and bitter divisions over homosexuality came to a head last month in a curiously furtive ceremony in Singapore Cathedral when the Archbishops of Rwanda and Singapore consecrated a couple of \"missionary bishops\" for American congregations who will preach the pure word of hostility to gays. This is simple and formal schism, a declaration that they belong to a different church from that of the bishops of the official Anglican body. The joke is that Dr Carey's instincts are entirely on the side of the schismatics. His son Andrew is deputy editor of the Church of England Newspaper, a tiny weekly which is the house organ of the anti-gay forces. When the archbishop last week released a formal letter explaining that he cannot recognise the new bishops, it contained a passage suggesting that even though he must officially reprimand them, he would do so with his fingers crossed: \"I do not question... their own perception that the situation in the United States is so serious that this action could be justified.\" But here, as elsewhere, he can't be the decisive leader he pretends to be. To repudiate the official, liberal church in America would have the immediate effect of breaking up and probably bankrupting the Anglican Communion, just as a hard line on divorce and second marriages would drive numerous faithful Christians out of the church.",

      "body": "<p>A jury's verdict this week in the case of four white policemen accused of murdering a young black street trader last February in the Bronx will be treated as a referendum on law enforcement in America's biggest city.</p> <p>The name of Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from West Africa, would never have been known outside his immediate circle had he not been hit by 19 of the 41 police bullets fired at him in the entrance to his block of flats in New York.</p> <p>But in the year since the shooting of Diallo, who was armed only with a wallet and a pager, the case has come to represent for New Yorkers the trade-off between crime-fighting and discrimination.</p> <p>\"It's tough being black in the United States,\" said Stephen Worth, a lawyer who is defending one of the four police officers. He is not referring to the fate of Diallo, 22. Rather, he is considering the chances of the county court jury in the state capital of Albany delivering a verdict of not guilty.</p> <p>\"The black jurors got to go back to their neighbourhoods and maybe answer for clearing white cops,\" said Mr Worth, after another day in court. \"It's about what the jury believes,\" he added. \"They killed the wrong guy. We don't deny that. But these are good lads.\"</p> <p>Most mornings this month the four have trudged past ranks of cameras to enter the courthouse. Police guarding the building - some of them black - acknowledge their arrival with handshakes. Albany is 160 miles north of New York, but this is still the thin blue line in action, a camaraderie that is part of the mythology which, depending on the beholder, earns New York City policemen praise or derision as racists in and out of uniform.</p> <p>The reason is plain enough. Crime in the city has plummeted in the past 10 years, with murders down from 2,245 in 1990 to 667 last year. But it took the death of Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, to crystalise discontent at police methods.</p> <p>Critics claim that, at its simplest, the policy of \"zero tolerance\"- cracking down on petty offences in the hope of discouraging more serious crimes - means searching blacks and Hispanics in the hope of finding firearms. Much of this work is done by the plainclothes special crimes unit, to which the four men on trial belonged.</p> <p>The fall in crime figures allows New York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, to boast: \"New York is the safest city in America with a population of more than a million.\" But in a city where ethnic minorities account for more than 60% of residents, such targeting was bound to create resentment.</p> <p>A judge ruled that the policemen could not get a fair hearing in the Bronx so the trial was moved north to Albany, seat of government and home to a population of about 100,000 which is more than 80% white.</p> <p>The conduct of the trial has been muted, save for the day when Sean Carroll, at 36 the oldest of the policemen, broke down in tears as he explained how he was first to open fire.</p> <p>The defence says that the policemen, who were looking for a rapist, made a tragic mistake by shooting Diallo, believing that he was reaching for a gun when in fact he was pulling out his wallet. The prosecution says that the men had no good reason to open fire, shouted no warning and carried on shooting after Diallo went down.</p> <p>Now the jury must select from a range of charges: from second-degree murder, which carries a maximum of 25 years to life, to criminally negligent homicide with a minimum sentence of probation.</p> <p>There have been daily prayer meetings and demonstrations in Albany against the shooting, but nothing like the star power that the black activist, the Rev Al Sharpton, was able to mobilise over this case a year ago.

      "bodyText": "A jury's verdict this week in the case of four white policemen accused of murdering a young black street trader last February in the Bronx will be treated as a referendum on law enforcement in America's biggest city. The name of Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from West Africa, would never have been known outside his immediate circle had he not been hit by 19 of the 41 police bullets fired at him in the entrance to his block of flats in New York. But in the year since the shooting of Diallo, who was armed only with a wallet and a pager, the case has come to represent for New Yorkers the trade-off between crime-fighting and discrimination. \"It's tough being black in the United States,\" said Stephen Worth, a lawyer who is defending one of the four police officers. He is not referring to the fate of Diallo, 22. Rather, he is considering the chances of the county court jury in the state capital of Albany delivering a verdict of not guilty. \"The black jurors got to go back to their neighbourhoods and maybe answer for clearing white cops,\" said Mr Worth, after another day in court. \"It's about what the jury believes,\" he added. \"They killed the wrong guy. We don't deny that. But these are good lads.\" Most mornings this month the four have trudged past ranks of cameras to enter the courthouse. Police guarding the building - some of them black - acknowledge their arrival with handshakes. Albany is 160 miles north of New York, but this is still the thin blue line in action, a camaraderie that is part of the mythology which, depending on the beholder, earns New York City policemen praise or derision as racists in and out of uniform. The reason is plain enough. Crime in the city has plummeted in the past 10 years, with murders down from 2,245 in 1990 to 667 last year. But it took the death of Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, to crystalise discontent at police methods. Critics claim that, at its simplest, the policy of \"zero tolerance\"- cracking down on petty offences in the hope of discouraging more serious crimes - means searching blacks and Hispanics in the hope of finding firearms. Much of this work is done by the plainclothes special crimes unit, to which the four men on trial belonged. The fall in crime figures allows New York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, to boast: \"New York is the safest city in America with a population of more than a million.\" But in a city where ethnic minorities account for more than 60% of residents, such targeting was bound to create resentment. A judge ruled that the policemen could not get a fair hearing in the Bronx so the trial was moved north to Albany, seat of government and home to a population of about 100,000 which is more than 80% white. The conduct of the trial has been muted, save for the day when Sean Carroll, at 36 the oldest of the policemen, broke down in tears as he explained how he was first to open fire. The defence says that the policemen, who were looking for a rapist, made a tragic mistake by shooting Diallo, believing that he was reaching for a gun when in fact he was pulling out his wallet. The prosecution says that the men had no good reason to open fire, shouted no warning and carried on shooting after Diallo went down. Now the jury must select from a range of charges: from second-degree murder, which carries a maximum of 25 years to life, to criminally negligent homicide with a minimum sentence of probation. There have been daily prayer meetings and demonstrations in Albany against the shooting, but nothing like the star power that the black activist, the Rev Al Sharpton, was able to mobilise over this case a year ago. The Rev Jesse Jackson and the film star Susan Sarandon were among the more than 1,000 people who were arrested for trespass during those protests. These days, though Mr Sharpton is ever-present, it is generally lesser known but equally passionate protesters who are turning out. They include students, clerics, those who say they have suffered at the hands of the police and members of lobby groups. Inside the court, a couple of dozen policemen in the public gallery, activists up from New York City, sport badges saying: \"Free the Bronx Four.\" Other policemen prefer to keep their heads down, but that does not mean the Diallo case has not influenced them. \"Now when I hear there's a situation, I don't rush there,\" said one in his 40s. \"Why put yourself on the line? Now I'd rather get me a doughnut and coffee.\" Sympathy could hardly be expected from Diallo's mother, Kadiatou. \"The fact is they have seen a dark-skinned man and they just decided to take his life.\" She also acts as a reminder that her son was a person, not just a cause. \"He is not an immigrant,\" she says. \"He's somebody. He's human. He has a home and a family.\" The accused \u0095Sean Carroll Age: 36 Years on force: six Shots fired: all 16 in pistol \u0095Edward McMellon Age: 27 Years on force: six Shots fired: all 16 \u0095Kenneth Boss Age: 28 Years on force: eight Shots fired: five \u0095Richard Murphy Age: 27 Years on force: six Shots fired: four",

      "bodyText": "Australian forest authorities have been contracted to plant 40,500 hectares of trees (about 100,000 acres) on behalf of one of Japan's largest power companies in a controversial scheme to fight global warming. The trees are meant to offset some of the greenhouse gas emissions generated in Tokyo. The Tokyo Electric Power Company signed the deal, which could cost up to \u00a350m, with the New South Wales's forestry division to grow hard and softwood plantations to capture carbon dioxide (CO2). But environmentalists question whether the project, scheduled to run for 10 years, will work. They claim the area is too small and that the forests must be maintained forever or the CO2 will go back into the atmosphere when the trees are processed. The New South Wales government courted Japanese industry investment in its forests to earn lucrative credits for offsetting gas emissions, under an international scheme proposed in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. In the protocol industrialised countries agreed to reduce their 1990 level of emissions by an average of 6% by 2010. Those unable or unwilling to meet their legal obligation to reach the target would - under the credit scheme currently being finalised, though yet to be ratified by protocol signatories - have the option of paying other countries to help reduce their emissions.

But environmental experts claim such finely targeted efforts will be nowhere near enough. \"It's really good that people are starting to pay attention to the issue of global warming, but they should be conscious of the fact that there is no straightforward fix,\" said Chris Mitchell of CSIRO, which runs the Australian government's greenhouse research programme. Concentration was needed on \"using energy efficiently, developing new energy technologies and switching to less greenhouse-intrusive fuels\". A Greenpeace spokesman, Robbie Kelman, said massive areas of tree planting would be required to compensate for Australia's 400m tonnes of annual carbon emissions. A company might be able to offset 5% of its emissions, he said. \"But to offset just one year of Australia's emissions, we have calculated it would take an area about the size of the state of Victoria [about 23m hectares] every year.\" Tokyo Power estimates that the plantations could earn it about 30,000 tonnes of carbon credits annually.

In Italy, three people died and one was suffering from severe hypothermia after a group of seven German skiers accompanied by a local guide triggered an avalanche in the Val Venosta near the Austrian border, some 50 miles from the northern city of Bolzano. Rescue official Luigi Weger said the group, which had been on an unauthorised route, became trapped by the avalanche. Rescuers recovered the bodies of two women and one man and accounted for the remaining five skiers, he added. The avalanche was the second to strike the province of Alto Adige in as many days: two skiers died at nearby Punta Alta Croce on Saturday. In eastern Switzerland, three people were killed and a fourth was injured when an avalanche swept into a ski run near Davos at the height of the winter holiday season. Police blamed the avalanche on a German man and his son who skied into an area of deep snow despite avalanche warnings. The two set off a snowslide that covered the father, along with two Swiss men skiing farther down the mountain on a prepared course. Only the son survived. Around 100 rescuers with sniffer dogs spent seven hours searching for survivors The three skiers' bodies were recovered and police said there were no more victims. \"There was an avalanche risk today, we triggered snowslides early in the morning and we did everything we could to avoid this\", Markus Good, a local official said. Avalanches rarely hit resort areas and prosecutors have opened an investigation. Experts warned of a serious danger of more avalanches in days to come in what for most alpine resorts is the height of the winter sports season, with schools across Europe on half-term holiday. More than 1.5m (5ft) of snow has fallen across Europe's Alpine regions in the past three days, and yesterday's bright sunshine dramatically increased the chances of large slabs of recent powder falling away from the compacted layer underneath.",

The violence came after thousands of Christians took to the streets chanting \"no to sharia\" amid a wave of populist sentiment in favour of imposing Islamic law across northern Nigeria, following its introduction in the state of Zamfara. The sharia code bans alcohol, adultery and women's football teams, and segregates schools and public transport. In recent days, Zamfara carried out its first sentences imposed under sharia, with one man receiving 100 lashes for sex with an unmarried woman and another flogged for drinking alcohol in public. Many of the other 18 northern states, including Kaduna, are drafting similar laws despite protests from Christians and southerners who see sharia as a form of ethnic persecution. About half of Nigeria's 100m population is Muslim, with the vast majority living in the north, where sharia has long been applied to civil and family cases.

The Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, told Israel Radio yesterday that Israel was deliberately stalling the talks so that Mr Ehud could strike a deal with Syria first. </p> <p>Mr Barak yesterday blamed the Palestinians for the deadlock. \"For some reason, they feel unripe at the moment to expose their positions,\" he said. He also blamed Damascus for the breakdown of talks with Syria last month. </p> <p>But Mr Barak reaffirmed that Israel would go ahead with the withdrawal of its forces from south Lebanon by July even if no agreement was reached with its neighbours, although \"it might cost some lives on both sides of the border\". <br> Suzanne Goldenberg, Jerusalem </p> <p><b> Cape Town dean sorry for devil ad</b><br> </p> <p> An Anglican dean in Cape Town, South Africa, who appeared in an advertisement for a gay and lesbian film festival with a devil's tail poking from under his vestments escaped dismissal yesterday, despite protests from parishioners and church wardens. </p> <p>Rowan Smith, the openly gay dean of St George's cathedral, appeared in the advert preaching against hate. \"They say homosexuals are the devil's spawn but I don't believe that,\" he says, before revealing the red tail and a caption reading: \"Get thee behind me\". </p> <p>At Sunday services, the Rev Smith apologised for any \"sense of disgust or confusion\" caused by his role in the advert and for allowing it to be filmed in his church. But he claimed the demands for his dismissal were partly racially motivated - he is black, while most of his worshippers are white. </p> <p>Many in the dean's congregation were not satisfied by his apology. Terry Crawford-Browne, whose wife resigned as church warden in protest at the advert, fashioned a monkey's tail from a dressing gown and wore it to Sunday's service. \"The clergy think they can treat the laity like monkeys,\" he said. </p> <p>The archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane, yesterday said the church wardens had been persuaded to withdraw their demand for Rev Smith's dismissal despite his \"serious error of judgment\". The archbishop said the dean would be taking a few days' leave while the \"process of healing\" got under way. </p> <p>\"He is very stressed and needs the guidance and support of the church,\" he added. <br>Chris McGreal, Johannesburg </p> <p><b> Maverick artist dies at 71</b><br> </p> <p> The Austrian painter and architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser has died, aged 71, his manager said yesterday. </p> <p>The artist suffered heart failure on Saturday, while travelling from his adopted home in New Zealand to Europe, aboard the Queen Elizabeth II, Joram Harel said. </p> <p>Hundertwasser, never without his trademark odd socks, was renowned for his vibrant paintings which often featured a spiral spattered by droplets of contrasting colour. </p> <p>In line with his philosophy that \"the straight line is godless\", Hundertwasser also designed rounded buildings with bulging, organic forms, in defiance of the classic rules of architecture. </p> <p>Works such as a patchwork-tiled Vienna council house, a Vienna incinerator boasting a golden onion-shaped dome and a thermal spa complex in Blumau in Styria which has a roof topped with grass have become sightseeing favourites in Austria. </p> <p>Born Friedrich Stowasser in Vienna in 1928, Hundertwasser spent the second world war in hiding with his Jewish mother. But he never renounced his homeland, the birthplace of Adolf Hitler, despite choosing to live and work in New Zealand. </p> <p>\"I want to make people feel that life is worth living,\" Hundertwasser once said in an interview. \"I hate hopeless art.\" </p> <p>As an architect, Hundertwasser's designs reflected his increasingly ecologically-focused beliefs. He aimed to bring nature back into the home by incorporating trees into his higgledy-piggledy houses. \"I change sick houses into humane houses in harmony with nature,\" he said. <br>Reuters, Vienna </p> <p><b> Turkish PM warns mayors</b><br> </p> <p> The Turkish prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, yesterday warned pro-Kurdish mayors in the south-east of the country to stick to local issues and stop playing politics. The warning came after three prominent mayors were arrested at the weekend, and accused of helping the Kurdish rebel group, the PKK. </p> <p>The Kurdish issue is one of the most sensitive areas of disagreement between Turkey and the European Union, and some European diplomats in Ankara believe there are forces within the Turkish establishment that want to sabotage good relations between the two sides. </p> <p>After Turkey was accepted as a candidate for EU membership in December, the EU had hoped it could begin preparing for formal membership negotiations by tackling some of the more non-controversial issues. But the arrest of the three mayors has put the Kurdish problem back at the top of the agenda. </p> <p>\"It takes two to tango,\" one senior European diplomat said. \"One has to ask who is in charge of the public relations department here.\" </p> <p>The arrests have also served to raise tensions in the mainly Kurdish south-east. Several thousand people demonstrated yesterday outside the office of the mayor of Diyarbakir, Feridun Celik, who was one of the three taken into custody. Officials from the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy party, or Hadep, said the protests would continue every day until the mayor is released. <br>hris Morris, Ankara </p> <p><b> Dad chains up belly dancer son </b><br> </p> <p> Police in Istanbul have rescued a 19-year-old male belly dancer whose father chained him to a bed for three days to prevent him from performing at nightclubs, a newspaper reported yesterday. </p> <p>Neighbours alerted Turkish police Sunday after they heard Mahmut Dagyolu's cries for help, the Hurriyet newspaper said.

      "bodyText": "Barak says peace is achievable Israel's soldier-prime minister, Ehud Barak, rolled out the military metaphors yesterday to reassure Jewish American leaders that despite the deadlock in talks with both Syria and the Palestinians, he would pilot Israel to peace and greater security. \"We are in a phase of difficulty; we should not lose eye contact with the objective, and we should not lose our nerve,\" he said, speaking to US Jewish leaders in Jerusalem hours before the arrival of the US Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross. \"This difficulty on all tracks - with the Syrians and Palestinians as well as Lebanon - was quite predictable.\" Mr Barak said his negotiators would unveil new measures to kick-start talks with the Palestinians that have been hanging for more than two weeks. Following last week's expiry of the deadline by which Israel should have handed over 6.1% of the West Bank, Mr Barak said: \"I don't think any date in this regard is sacred.\" But there is rising anger among Palestinians at the delays in the peace process. The Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, told Israel Radio yesterday that Israel was deliberately stalling the talks so that Mr Ehud could strike a deal with Syria first. Mr Barak yesterday blamed the Palestinians for the deadlock. \"For some reason, they feel unripe at the moment to expose their positions,\" he said. He also blamed Damascus for the breakdown of talks with Syria last month. But Mr Barak reaffirmed that Israel would go ahead with the withdrawal of its forces from south Lebanon by July even if no agreement was reached with its neighbours, although \"it might cost some lives on both sides of the border\". Suzanne Goldenberg, Jerusalem Cape Town dean sorry for devil ad An Anglican dean in Cape Town, South Africa, who appeared in an advertisement for a gay and lesbian film festival with a devil's tail poking from under his vestments escaped dismissal yesterday, despite protests from parishioners and church wardens. Rowan Smith, the openly gay dean of St George's cathedral, appeared in the advert preaching against hate. \"They say homosexuals are the devil's spawn but I don't believe that,\" he says, before revealing the red tail and a caption reading: \"Get thee behind me\". At Sunday services, the Rev Smith apologised for any \"sense of disgust or confusion\" caused by his role in the advert and for allowing it to be filmed in his church. But he claimed the demands for his dismissal were partly racially motivated - he is black, while most of his worshippers are white. Many in the dean's congregation were not satisfied by his apology. Terry Crawford-Browne, whose wife resigned as church warden in protest at the advert, fashioned a monkey's tail from a dressing gown and wore it to Sunday's service. \"The clergy think they can treat the laity like monkeys,\" he said. The archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane, yesterday said the church wardens had been persuaded to withdraw their demand for Rev Smith's dismissal despite his \"serious error of judgment\". The archbishop said the dean would be taking a few days' leave while the \"process of healing\" got under way. \"He is very stressed and needs the guidance and support of the church,\" he added. Chris McGreal, Johannesburg Maverick artist dies at 71 The Austrian painter and architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser has died, aged 71, his manager said yesterday. The artist suffered heart failure on Saturday, while travelling from his adopted home in New Zealand to Europe, aboard the Queen Elizabeth II, Joram Harel said. Hundertwasser, never without his trademark odd socks, was renowned for his vibrant paintings which often featured a spiral spattered by droplets of contrasting colour. In line with his philosophy that \"the straight line is godless\", Hundertwasser also designed rounded buildings with bulging, organic forms, in defiance of the classic rules of architecture. Works such as a patchwork-tiled Vienna council house, a Vienna incinerator boasting a golden onion-shaped dome and a thermal spa complex in Blumau in Styria which has a roof topped with grass have become sightseeing favourites in Austria. Born Friedrich Stowasser in Vienna in 1928, Hundertwasser spent the second world war in hiding with his Jewish mother. But he never renounced his homeland, the birthplace of Adolf Hitler, despite choosing to live and work in New Zealand. \"I want to make people feel that life is worth living,\" Hundertwasser once said in an interview. \"I hate hopeless art.\" As an architect, Hundertwasser's designs reflected his increasingly ecologically-focused beliefs. He aimed to bring nature back into the home by incorporating trees into his higgledy-piggledy houses. \"I change sick houses into humane houses in harmony with nature,\" he said. Reuters, Vienna Turkish PM warns mayors The Turkish prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, yesterday warned pro-Kurdish mayors in the south-east of the country to stick to local issues and stop playing politics. The warning came after three prominent mayors were arrested at the weekend, and accused of helping the Kurdish rebel group, the PKK. The Kurdish issue is one of the most sensitive areas of disagreement between Turkey and the European Union, and some European diplomats in Ankara believe there are forces within the Turkish establishment that want to sabotage good relations between the two sides. After Turkey was accepted as a candidate for EU membership in December, the EU had hoped it could begin preparing for formal membership negotiations by tackling some of the more non-controversial issues. But the arrest of the three mayors has put the Kurdish problem back at the top of the agenda. \"It takes two to tango,\" one senior European diplomat said. \"One has to ask who is in charge of the public relations department here.\" The arrests have also served to raise tensions in the mainly Kurdish south-east. Several thousand people demonstrated yesterday outside the office of the mayor of Diyarbakir, Feridun Celik, who was one of the three taken into custody. Officials from the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy party, or Hadep, said the protests would continue every day until the mayor is released. hris Morris, Ankara Dad chains up belly dancer son Police in Istanbul have rescued a 19-year-old male belly dancer whose father chained him to a bed for three days to prevent him from performing at nightclubs, a newspaper reported yesterday. Neighbours alerted Turkish police Sunday after they heard Mahmut Dagyolu's cries for help, the Hurriyet newspaper said. His left arm and leg were chained to the bed. Mr Dagyolu said his father had chained him up because he objected to his belly dancing, the newspaper reported. Although female belly dancing is common, several Istanbul nightclubs have recently begun to hire male belly dancers. AP, Istanbul Love's rich dream on the rocks?

      "body": "<p>Bill Clinton's hopes that his eight-year presidency of the United States will get a more glowing verdict from historians than it has received from contemporary commentators were dashed yesterday, when a survey of American historians declared him just plain average.</p> <p>Given some of the things that his enemies say about him, Mr Clinton arguably did quite well to finish exactly in mid-table -ranked 21st out of the 41 - in a presidential survey of 58 American history professors conducted for the public affairs television channel C-Span. On one of the 10 qualities assessed by the historians - moral authority - Mr Clinton finished at the bottom of the pile, below even Richard Nixon. On relations with the US Congress, he came 36th.</p> <p>While some will say that he was lucky his ranking was not worse, Mr Clinton did much better than the only other president to be impeached, Andrew Johnson, who finished next to bottom overall.</p> <p>Mr Clinton is sure to feel personally slighted that the man he ousted so skilfully from the White House in 1992, George Bush, finished just ahead of him in the rankings, in 20th place, and that Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, two of the least venerated American presidents of recent times, come in just on his heels.</p> <p>The best scores Mr Clinton achieved were for the pursuit of equal justice, where he finished fifth, and in economic management, where he also ranked fifth. Mr Clinton was assessed 11th on his public persuasion skills.</p> <p>America's greatest president, the historians agreed, was Abraham Lincoln, who led the US through its greatest crisis, the 1861-65 civil war with the secessionist southern confederacy. Lincoln came first in five of 10 qualities the historians considered which included crisis leadership, administrative skills, vision, pursuit of equal justice, and performance in the context of the times. Lincoln ranked second on moral authority, after the nation's founder George Washington.</p> <p>Overall, Franklin Roosevelt came second, a choice which to some extent reflects the generation and influence of the historians surveyed. Roosevelt's achievements in saving the US from the great depression of the 1930s and then leading the nation through the second world war put him comfortably into second place, as well as giving him top marks in the public persuasion, economic management and international relations sections.</p> <p><b> Revered at Rushmore </b><br></p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, George Washington only managed third place overall, but ranked first on moral authority, and second on administrative skills and performance for his times. Washington's imperishable status as the father of the independent US - he became president in 1789 - has been dimmed in parts of the country in recent years because he was a slave-owner on his Virginia estate.</p> <p>Theodore Roosevelt's fourth place confirms his rising status not just among historians but also among today's generation of politicians of both parties. Both Mr Clinton, a Democrat, and the Republican presidential contender, John McCain, are fond of identifying themselves with TR's early 20th century version of Third Way government. In many ways the most remarkable rating is Harry Truman's fifth place. The reputation of the president who seemed eclipsed when he took over after FDR's death in 1945 and who led the US into the Korean war, has risen steadily since his death; he is now venerated for his decision-making, personal modesty and probity. One of the historians who directed the survey, Douglas Brinkley, a professor at the university of New Orleans, said yesterday that Truman had reached the pantheon of the truly great American leaders. \"His face should be chiselled on Mount Rushmore right next to Theodore Roosevelt,\" he said.</p> <p>And then there is the position of Ronald Reagan.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton's hopes that his eight-year presidency of the United States will get a more glowing verdict from historians than it has received from contemporary commentators were dashed yesterday, when a survey of American historians declared him just plain average. Given some of the things that his enemies say about him, Mr Clinton arguably did quite well to finish exactly in mid-table -ranked 21st out of the 41 - in a presidential survey of 58 American history professors conducted for the public affairs television channel C-Span. On one of the 10 qualities assessed by the historians - moral authority - Mr Clinton finished at the bottom of the pile, below even Richard Nixon. On relations with the US Congress, he came 36th. While some will say that he was lucky his ranking was not worse, Mr Clinton did much better than the only other president to be impeached, Andrew Johnson, who finished next to bottom overall. Mr Clinton is sure to feel personally slighted that the man he ousted so skilfully from the White House in 1992, George Bush, finished just ahead of him in the rankings, in 20th place, and that Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, two of the least venerated American presidents of recent times, come in just on his heels. The best scores Mr Clinton achieved were for the pursuit of equal justice, where he finished fifth, and in economic management, where he also ranked fifth. Mr Clinton was assessed 11th on his public persuasion skills. America's greatest president, the historians agreed, was Abraham Lincoln, who led the US through its greatest crisis, the 1861-65 civil war with the secessionist southern confederacy. Lincoln came first in five of 10 qualities the historians considered which included crisis leadership, administrative skills, vision, pursuit of equal justice, and performance in the context of the times. Lincoln ranked second on moral authority, after the nation's founder George Washington. Overall, Franklin Roosevelt came second, a choice which to some extent reflects the generation and influence of the historians surveyed. Roosevelt's achievements in saving the US from the great depression of the 1930s and then leading the nation through the second world war put him comfortably into second place, as well as giving him top marks in the public persuasion, economic management and international relations sections. Revered at Rushmore Perhaps surprisingly, George Washington only managed third place overall, but ranked first on moral authority, and second on administrative skills and performance for his times. Washington's imperishable status as the father of the independent US - he became president in 1789 - has been dimmed in parts of the country in recent years because he was a slave-owner on his Virginia estate. Theodore Roosevelt's fourth place confirms his rising status not just among historians but also among today's generation of politicians of both parties. Both Mr Clinton, a Democrat, and the Republican presidential contender, John McCain, are fond of identifying themselves with TR's early 20th century version of Third Way government. In many ways the most remarkable rating is Harry Truman's fifth place. The reputation of the president who seemed eclipsed when he took over after FDR's death in 1945 and who led the US into the Korean war, has risen steadily since his death; he is now venerated for his decision-making, personal modesty and probity. One of the historians who directed the survey, Douglas Brinkley, a professor at the university of New Orleans, said yesterday that Truman had reached the pantheon of the truly great American leaders. \"His face should be chiselled on Mount Rushmore right next to Theodore Roosevelt,\" he said. And then there is the position of Ronald Reagan. His 1981-89 presidency is sanctified by many on the Republican right, yet he could only finish in 11th place in the survey. Mr Reagan, who is 89 and suffering from Alzheimer's disease, normally finishes much higher in modern-day surveys of the general public asking about American presidents. At the Mount Rushmore monument in South Dakota, where visitors can vote for their most revered president, Mr Reagan at the moment ranks fourth, behind Lincoln, Washington and FDR, in public esteem. Hardly less striking than President Reagan's eclipse is the continuing rehabilitation of the man who finished one place above him in the survey, Lyndon Johnson. Forced to leave the presidency in 1968 because of the Vietnam war, President Johnson's posthumous reputation has continued to rise steadily and inexorably, largely on account of his civil rights legislation, which covered opportunity in education, and for his 1964 \"war on poverty\". Johnson, a Democrat, was the 36th president of the US and the only one in the survey other than Lincoln, Washington and FDR to finish first in a category - that of presidential relations with Congress. The historians rated James Buchanan the worst president in American history. Buchanan, who presided over the descent into secession and civil war during his presidency from 1857 to 1861, finished last in four categories - those of crisis leadership, vision, pursuit of equal justice and performance. Buchanan was also the only bachelor president in US history, though there is no suggestion that this distinction was held against him. White House winners and losers 1 Abraham Lincoln (1861-65) From log cabin to White House, then won the civil war and set the slaves free. And was assassinated. 2 Franklin D Roosevelt (1933-45) With New Deal, FDR brought recovery at the nadir of the Great Depression and saw US through most of the war. 3 George Washington (1789-97) Well, the first president has got to rank highly. 4 Teddy Roosevelt (1901-09) Remembered for the Panama Canal, starting America's national parks, and giving his name to the Teddy Bear. 5 Harry Truman (1945-53) Dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 6 Woodrow Wilson (1913-21) The most academic president, he brought US troops into the first world war in 1917. 7 Thomas Jefferson (1801-09) Drafted the Declaration of Independence, then went on to become the third president. 8 John F Kennedy (1961-63) Womaniser remembered more for his youthfulness, civil rights and his assassination. 9 Dwight D Eisenhower (1953-61) D-Day hero who presided over post-war prosperity and the early years of the cold war. 10 Lyndon Johnson (1963-69) Took the reins on JFK's death, passed civil rights laws, and pumped troops into Vietnam. 11 Ronald Reagan (1981-89) B-movie actor turned feelgood president, scourge of communists and friend of Maggie. 12 James Polk (1845-49) Paid $15m for California and New Mexico. 13 Andrew Jackson (1829-37) \"Old Hickory\" saw the split of US politics into Democrats and National Republicans 14 James Monroe (1817-25) Doctrine told Europe: keep your hands off the Americas 15 William McKinley (1897-1901) He annexed the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico. 16 John Adams (1797-1801) He had a hard act to follow as the second president. 17 Grover Cleveland (1885-89) A big man, the only president to marry in the White House 18 James Madison (1809-17) Declared war against Britain. 19 John Quincy Adams (1825-29) The only president who was the son of a president 20 George Bush (1989-93) Read my lips: but not on taxes 21 Bill Clinton (1993-) Forget the boom. Remember Monica 22 Jimmy Carter (1977-81) Peanut farmer humiliated over Tehran hostages. 23 Gerald Ford (1974-77) Caricatured as the president who couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time. 24 William Taft (1909-13) More interested in law than politics. 25 Richard Nixon (1969-74) \"Tricky Dicky\" authorised the Watergate break-in. 26 Rutherford Hayes (1877-81) Republican civil war veteran who promoted civil rights. 27 Calvin Coolidge (1923-29) Presided over 1920s boom. 28 Zachary Taylor (1849-50) Soldier who died in first year. 29 James Garfield (1881) Term cut short by assassin. 30 Martin Van Buren (1837-41) Blocked annexation of Texas for fear of provoking Mexico. 31 Benjamin Harrison (1889-93) Signed first anti-trust act. 32 Chester Arthur (1881-85) Immigration law excluded paupers, criminals and lunatics. 33 Ulysses Grant (1869-77) Victorious civil war general criticised for heavy drinking. 34 Herbert Hoover (1929-33) Seen as doing little to mitigate misery of the Depression. 35 Millard Fillmore (1850-53) Gave slaveowners state aid for hunting down runaway slaves. 36 John Tyler (1841-45) Faced first impeachment. 37 William Harrison (1841) Caught a cold and became first president to die in office. 38 Warren Harding (1921-23) Speeches were \"an army of pompous phrases moving in search of an idea.\" 39 Franklin Pierce (1853-57) Democrat who failed to resolve the slave controversy. 40 Andrew Johnson (1865-69) Pro-Union southern Democrat who was impeached. 41 James Buchanan (1857-61) Like so many, retrospectively blamed for civil war.",

But to read the weather? Is that not one of the little corners of modern life, like a dog track, or a park bench, where it's OK to be over 35, and (shhh) male? Perhaps even to wear glasses, a checked jacket and an ill-advised tie? We're not talking game-show hosts, or garden make-overs, after all - this is just a quick slot after the news, a couple of minutes of cold fronts and showers, and no one really listens anyway, do they? It's fine - comforting, even - to be read to by a middle-aged bloke. </p> <p>In the US, the Weather Channel, all 24 hours a day of it, is fronted by impressive and powerfully dressed people. They stand in front of huge maps with important features to point out - Rockies, deserts, great plains, great lakes, grand canyons. And they have the weather to match: 100 degrees here, -100 degrees there, a tornado here, an ice storm there. This is weather that requires youth, pronounced jaws, strong white teeth and a powerful outfit. But a bit of drizzle over the Midlands, seven hours of sunshine in Lowestoft, the odd fog patch? This is weather that demands to be presented by Michael Fish and John Kettley. Of course, the one time in 1987 we did have a bit of excitement, weatherwise, Michael Fish got it wrong. For which we love him all the more. </p> <p> T he BBC still recruits its weather people from the Met Office, so Isobel, Helen, Sarah, et al do at least know their isobars from their isotherms. And, as a Birmingham university survey revealed a couple of years back, all TV presenters are terrible at predicting the weather anyway. In fact, one wonders whether these changes are all for naught; another survey revealed that a couple of minutes after a weather forecast, most people couldn't remember a thing about it. </p> <p>There was talk a couple of years ago of jacking in the Beeb-Met Office association, and there's no doubt the barometer is falling (sorry, last meteorological metaphor, promise) in the direction of Ulrika, Nicole in To Die For, or even worse, ITV weather. Sponsored by Powergen, no doubt.

It's fine - comforting, even - to be read to by a middle-aged bloke. In the US, the Weather Channel, all 24 hours a day of it, is fronted by impressive and powerfully dressed people. They stand in front of huge maps with important features to point out - Rockies, deserts, great plains, great lakes, grand canyons. And they have the weather to match: 100 degrees here, -100 degrees there, a tornado here, an ice storm there. This is weather that requires youth, pronounced jaws, strong white teeth and a powerful outfit. But a bit of drizzle over the Midlands, seven hours of sunshine in Lowestoft, the odd fog patch? This is weather that demands to be presented by Michael Fish and John Kettley. Of course, the one time in 1987 we did have a bit of excitement, weatherwise, Michael Fish got it wrong. For which we love him all the more. T he BBC still recruits its weather people from the Met Office, so Isobel, Helen, Sarah, et al do at least know their isobars from their isotherms. And, as a Birmingham university survey revealed a couple of years back, all TV presenters are terrible at predicting the weather anyway. In fact, one wonders whether these changes are all for naught; another survey revealed that a couple of minutes after a weather forecast, most people couldn't remember a thing about it. There was talk a couple of years ago of jacking in the Beeb-Met Office association, and there's no doubt the barometer is falling (sorry, last meteorological metaphor, promise) in the direction of Ulrika, Nicole in To Die For, or even worse, ITV weather. Sponsored by Powergen, no doubt. Meanwhile, watch out for A Tribe of Toffs' comeback single: 'John Kettley is on benefits Benefits Benefits John Kettley is on benefits And so is Michael Fish...'",

The facility will extract AAT, a protein used in treating cystic fibrosis, from the milk of transgenic sheep. </p> <p>It will mean at least 150 new jobs in the Lothians. The company's shares rose 18.5p to 135p on the announcement. </p> <p>PPL threatened last year to move the project to the US or New Zealand, complaining that few incentives were on offer in Scotland. However, it has secured \u00a32.5m in regional assistance and a \u00a313.5m loan from Royal Bank of Scotland underwritten by Scottish Enterprise. </p> <p><strong> Biomedica's pet project</strong><br> Gene therapy company Oxford Biomedica is to develop cancer vaccines for cats and dogs in a tie-up with French veterinary drugs group Virbac.

The facility will extract AAT, a protein used in treating cystic fibrosis, from the milk of transgenic sheep. It will mean at least 150 new jobs in the Lothians. The company's shares rose 18.5p to 135p on the announcement. PPL threatened last year to move the project to the US or New Zealand, complaining that few incentives were on offer in Scotland. However, it has secured \u00a32.5m in regional assistance and a \u00a313.5m loan from Royal Bank of Scotland underwritten by Scottish Enterprise. Biomedica's pet project Gene therapy company Oxford Biomedica is to develop cancer vaccines for cats and dogs in a tie-up with French veterinary drugs group Virbac. Chief executive Alan Kingsman said the market in cancer products for pets was worth $200m (\u00a3125m) in America and Europe. The company has several vaccines already in development for humans and believes these could be replicated for animal use. AstraZeneca spin-off inquiry The US federal trade commission has asked AstraZeneca for more information about the \u00a39.5bn spin-off of its agrochemicals division.

For more than two months Mannesmann fought off its British rival before eventually succumbing nearly three weeks ago. During the fight Vodafone's chief executive, Chris Gent, was even given the disparaging sobriquet of \"Mr Cricket\" by Germans upset by the hostile takeover of one of its industrial powerhouses. Mr Esser will join other senior corporate figures advising Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der on drafting new rules regarding hostile takeovers in Germany, said government spokesman Bela Anda. Hostile takeover bids have previously been a rarity in Germany and have even more rarely succeeded. Tyre company Pirelli laid siege to Germany's Continental in the early 1990s but eventually had to walk away empty-handed. The German tradition of firms being controlled by a small number of shareholders made hostile takeovers generally less likely to succeed. But the recent trend towards increasing use of the financial markets and therefore widened shareholder bases has made German companies more vulnerable. Planned tax changes which will lift big capital gains tax li abilities from German companies selling shares they hold in other domestic firms are likely to stimulate merger and acquistions activity, too. The success of the Vodafone AirTouch campaign to merge with Mannesmann has made corporate Germany reassess its position. The \u00a3104bn Mannesmann takeover is the biggest corporate merger in Europe and close to AOL's record-breaking purchase of Time Warner at the beginning of the millennium.

This could involve sweeping management changes.</p> <p>But, angered by what they see as a systematic under-valuation of the former state monopoly in the face of the relentless advance of alternative operators and mobile phone companies, he and his co-directors plan to use this platform to float the units.</p> <p>The hint that such plans are in the offing - though seen as highly defensive - was enough yesterday to send BT stock, which peaked at \u00a315.13 on December 30, up almost 9% from 964p (\"a steal\" in the words of one industry source) to \u00a310.51. It is understood that the plans are quite far advanced.</p> <p>Analysts say that a \"sum-of-the-parts\" valuation of BT would put its share price closer to \u00a315 or a market capitalisation approaching \u00a3100bn - rather than the \u00a367bn it reached at the end of last week.</p> <p>But the group estimates that, if and when the various floats go ahead, BT could be worth nearer \u00a319 a share or closer to the values put on fellow \"PTT\" groups such as Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.</p> <p>\"And they're still largely in state hands, with a heavy bureaucratic legacy,\" one exasperated insider said of the German and French giants which are flexing their muscles and earning plaudits by moving successfully into internet-related operations.</p> <p>Yellow Pages, which also owns Yellow Book in the US and could be listed separately in New York and London, is said by industry sources to be worth \u00a36bn.</p> <p>But analysts at JP Morgan said the fixed-line operation could be worth \u00a338.3bn, the internet operations \u00a38.5bn, the Concert global venture with AT&amp;T, \u00a313bn, the disparate European interests \u00a313.6bn and Asian investments \u00a35.6bn. They have put a value of \u00a321.2bn on Cellnet, the now wholly-owned mobile phones business, but other experts have suggested that rival group Orange - to be demerged or floated off later this year as part of Vodafone's merger with Mannesmann -could fetch more than \u00a330bn.</p> <p>Cellnet is the UK's second largest operator after Vodafone, although it lost ground to Orange in the surge of sales in the run-up to last Christmas. BT would hope to top Orange's value in any float.</p> <p>The group, which refused to comment publicly yesterday, insists that its independence is not in question despite rumours that several rival groups, in the US and Europe, are considering approaches.</p> <p>These include Deutsche Telekom, owner of the fourth UK mobile phone operator, One2One, SBC of America and Bell Atlantic. But analysts at Commerzbank believe a full-scale merger with AT&amp;T, BT's Concert partner, is \"the most obvious pairing\".</p> <p>Sir Peter, who fell out last week with the chancellor Gordon Brown over the timing of BT's plans to open up the \"local loop\" is said to be determined to beat off his critics with his plans.</p>",

But, angered by what they see as a systematic under-valuation of the former state monopoly in the face of the relentless advance of alternative operators and mobile phone companies, he and his co-directors plan to use this platform to float the units. The hint that such plans are in the offing - though seen as highly defensive - was enough yesterday to send BT stock, which peaked at \u00a315.13 on December 30, up almost 9% from 964p (\"a steal\" in the words of one industry source) to \u00a310.51. It is understood that the plans are quite far advanced. Analysts say that a \"sum-of-the-parts\" valuation of BT would put its share price closer to \u00a315 or a market capitalisation approaching \u00a3100bn - rather than the \u00a367bn it reached at the end of last week. But the group estimates that, if and when the various floats go ahead, BT could be worth nearer \u00a319 a share or closer to the values put on fellow \"PTT\" groups such as Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. \"And they're still largely in state hands, with a heavy bureaucratic legacy,\" one exasperated insider said of the German and French giants which are flexing their muscles and earning plaudits by moving successfully into internet-related operations. Yellow Pages, which also owns Yellow Book in the US and could be listed separately in New York and London, is said by industry sources to be worth \u00a36bn. But analysts at JP Morgan said the fixed-line operation could be worth \u00a338.3bn, the internet operations \u00a38.5bn, the Concert global venture with AT&amp;T, \u00a313bn, the disparate European interests \u00a313.6bn and Asian investments \u00a35.6bn. They have put a value of \u00a321.2bn on Cellnet, the now wholly-owned mobile phones business, but other experts have suggested that rival group Orange - to be demerged or floated off later this year as part of Vodafone's merger with Mannesmann -could fetch more than \u00a330bn. Cellnet is the UK's second largest operator after Vodafone, although it lost ground to Orange in the surge of sales in the run-up to last Christmas. BT would hope to top Orange's value in any float. The group, which refused to comment publicly yesterday, insists that its independence is not in question despite rumours that several rival groups, in the US and Europe, are considering approaches. These include Deutsche Telekom, owner of the fourth UK mobile phone operator, One2One, SBC of America and Bell Atlantic. But analysts at Commerzbank believe a full-scale merger with AT&amp;T, BT's Concert partner, is \"the most obvious pairing\". Sir Peter, who fell out last week with the chancellor Gordon Brown over the timing of BT's plans to open up the \"local loop\" is said to be determined to beat off his critics with his plans.",

      "bodyText": "Europe's largest energy market voted yesterday to end mutual ownership and become a for-profit public company. The vote ended a year of bitter wrangling about the future of the International Petroleum Exchange based in London. Chief executive Richard Ward confirmed that share certificates were likely to be issued on April 3. From that date members will be free to trade their stakes in an exchange estimated to be worth \u00a336m. But any bid for the IPE would face a big hurdle, in that the clearing members of the exchange - as opposed to members interested only in trading - will each be required to hold stock equivalent to 1% of the equity. Given there are 37 clearing members, that puts a near 40% roadblock in the path of a bid, and anyone making an offer would need first to call for and win a 75% majority at an extraordinary general meeting for a change in the articles of association. Dr Ward said the 37% block was \"a natural in-built defence mechanism\", but a source close to the New York Mercantile Exchange, or Nymex - which last year bid for control of the IPE - said the American exchange had not ruled out another attempt. The source said there remained a \"neat logic\" in the creation of a global trading platform based upon Nymex and the IPE. Meanwhile the five \"outside investors\" lined up by the IPE to buy a total of 70% of the market as part of last year's failed demutualisation plan are now free to buy shares from any willing sellers. The package approved yesterday involved only the principle of demutualisation. A new company, IPE Holdings, will be created to own IPE Limited, the excha nge. Shares in IPE Holdings will be issued to members and will become tradeable, as will trading rights on the exchange. The board retains the power to block share transfers, but will do so only if a potential shareholder is thought unfit by the financial services authority.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Garrison Keillor is sitting in his dressing room reading sonnets. Three thousand at the latest count, he says, and rising every time the postman calls. All because he suggested on the radio that listeners might try their hand at a Valentine's day poem. </p> <p>\"There are depths of love out there that we barely knew about,\" Keillor says. \"It's not the simplest thing to sit down and write 14 lines. All these people, overcome by the need to write a sonnet. Just imagine that.\" </p> <p>Imagining it is easy. A Prairie Home Companion - the programme that Keillor hosts each week - inspires levels of devotion that few radio shows can rival. </p> <p>There are people who plan their holidays around A Prairie Home Companion so as never to miss a show, and people who plan their holidays so they can attend live recordings at the Fitzgerald Theatre in St Paul, the show's Minnesota home. So if Keillor asks these people for sonnets, he should expect sonnets. </p> <p>A Prairie Home Companion goes out every Saturday across the US's National Public Radio network, just as it has done since it first started in 1974. This is therefore the silver jubilee season, and, to celebrate, Keillor and his team are bringing the show to Scotland and Ireland over the next couple of weeks, beaming it back live to the US and recording two episodes to be broadcast on Radio 4 and Ireland's RTE. </p> <p>The show is a mix of all kinds of music and comedy sketches, culminating in a set piece \"News From Lake Wobegon\" monologue delivered by Keillor to about 3m rapt listeners. The show begins with and returns to Keillor. At 5pm Central Time he starts it, singing \"Oh, hear that old piano/ From down the avenue...\" Two hours later, as he announces, \"And that's the news from Lake Wobegon, where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking and all the children are above average,\" the audience know it's home time. </p> <p>A Prairie Home Companion is an expression of Keillor's personality, his imagination and his values. Though the show is very funny, and the music is great, in some ineradicable way it is Keillor's loving and funny evocation of a kinder, simpler, better US that is at the heart of its appeal. \"It's based on a kind of show that existed in my youth,\" says Keillor, who grew up in 50s rural Minnesota. \"It's a live variety-show broadcast, but with some important differences.\" Like the range of its music, which can run from a cappella chorus through jazz, bluegrass, Cajun and Celtic, and occupies at least half of each show. And like the fact that Keillor devised and writes much of the show himself, sometimes finishing his script only just before the show airs. </p> <p>Watching Keillor in rehearsal and then as he hosts his show, it's hard not to wonder why he subjects himself to it. What would make this bespectacled middle-class Minnesotan gentleman of 57 stand on a stage and perform Great Balls of Fire for the millions? What would make a man with a new marriage and young daughter rise every morning at 5am to write? Whatever else Keillor keeps hidden about himself, and there's a sense of a dark side to him, you know that this is a driven man. </p> <p>He says that doing the show is \"good work\". He says it's \"a little harder than you'd like to be doing ideally in your late 50s\", but that it would be \"a terrible waste to just drop it\". He says he finds it easier to do these days. \"One of the great secrets that they don't tell you is that your declining years are really a lot more fun than when you were riding high and you were nervous about losing your touch.\" </p> <p>\"In my view,\" says producer Christine Tschida, who has worked with Keillor for the past 10 years, \"Garrison just has a need to stand up in front of an audience every Saturday.\" </p> <p>People in Britain know Keillor mostly as a writer - which is also how he likes to see himself. Lake Wobegon Days, published in 1985, was the first - and in many people's eyes the best - of a succession of novels and comic writings that have appeared at regular intervals ever since. His latest - Me by Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente as Told to Garrison Keillor - is a satire on the other iconic Minnesotan of the present era, the state's improbable governor Jesse Ventura, the man they call the Body Politic. </p> <p>Lake Wobegon is Keillor's Minnesotan never-never land. It permeates his books, and it has the honoured place in A Prairie Home Companion. \"It's both real and imaginary,\" he explains. \"But it does exist, it very much exists. Even here in Minneapolis and St Paul.\" </p> <p>\"All these rural people have come to live in the city, but they like to live on the outskirts, and they like to have an acre of land, two acres, three acres. These are Lake Wobegon people and they are a part of midwestern culture that's describable, and I think that I describe it. </p> <p>\"I write about it with love,\" he continues, \"but I also write about it satirically, because the people themselves have a satiric mind. They're very ironic people. But I think their reticence is funny - their dishonesty, their inability to tell the truth to each other, the great length they go to. And they are stoics. Stoics I think are comical. They never give up. They keep at hopeless tasks. And these people don't believe that they are entitled to happiness.\" </p> <p>Like the man himself, the writings may leave Minnesota from time to time, but it is to Minnesota that they always return. And the same is true of A Prairie Home Companion. Every year it goes on the road, occasionally, as now, overseas. But most of the shows are broadcast live from the Fitzgerald, the century-old theatre in downtown St Paul that Keillor helped to save a few years back, renaming it after the greatest of St Paul's literary sons. Keillor is an enthusiast of the author of The Great Gatsby - his cat is named F Cat Fitzgerald. </p> <p>The on-stage understanding between Keillor and his house band (led by keyboard player Rich Dworsky), actors Sue Scott and Tim Russell, and sound-effects man Tom Keith, speaks of years of respect. But there's no disputing that the only real place to see the show is at the Fitz, in winter, on Keillor's home ground, with snow in the streets and a theatre full of cheering devotees, which is where I saw it earlier this month. </p> <p>The weather looms large in Minnesota, and thus in the Lake Wobegon fantasy, and thus in A Prairie Home Companion too. \"It's a neutral place for a conversation to start,\" Keillor says. \"The show is about ordinary things. You don't need to have seen movies, or watched TV, or read books to understand the show.\" </p> <p>Winter is a big deal in Minnesota - bigger than anyone in the Britain can really know. \"Growing up in a place that has winter,\" Keillor has written, \"you learn to avoid self-pity. Winter is not a personal experience - everybody else is as cold as you - so you shouldn't complain about it too much.\" </p> <p>That passage is reprinted on a coffee mug that I bought in what must surely be the only store in the world devoted wholly to a radio show. Lake Wobegon USA is in the largest shopping mall on the planet - the Mall of America, outside Minneapolis airport. Dave Edin, who runs the shop, will talk Garrison Keillor with customers for as long as they are willing to listen. Which, in most cases, is a long time. </p> <p>\"I think about America every day,\" Keillor once wrote, \"and imagine a town, an avenue of old frame houses, a boulevard of tall trees, a June night, lawn sprinklers swishing across the grass and popping the flower bushes by the porch. A dog on the porch. Lights behind the curtains. Rock'n'roll in an upstairs bedroom. Charcoal smoke in the air, a whiff of burgers. A gang of kids skidding around on gravel, giggling. A screen door slaps and a dad marches out to the garage. Yard after yard, block after block, every sight and sound and smell utterly familiar. This is the American neighbourhood of childhood comfort and fantasy, of teenage ambition, and of the tenderness and misery and splendour and comedy of marriage. Movies and novels of brutality and greed may sell a zillion copies, but they're irrelevant to the life of this avenue, which is based on faith, hope, love and humour.\" </p> <p>In a sense, that's the key to the appeal of A Prairie Home Companion. \"I hope you enjoy the show,\" Keillor tells the Minnesota audience just as they go on air. \"And I hope I do too.\" It is great entertainment with a high purpose - and if you can come up with a better working definition of art, then you're welcome to it. </p> <p>\u0095 A Prairie Home Companion will be performed in the Queen's Hall, Edinburgh (0131-668 2019), on Friday and Saturday and broadcast on Radio 4 on April 1 and 8.</p>",

An amalgam of a real industrial stone drill and a futuristic - not to say Futurist - figure, the piece is an unwitting ancester to generations of pulp comic covers and TV and movie aliens. It also presaged a lot of sculpture which came much later in the century.</p> <p> I came face to face with the 70s reconstruction of the original - which is now lost - standing guard over a new display of the modern collection in Birmingham City Art Gallery in the morning, and caught up with it again that evening, at the grand opening of the New Art Gallery in Walsall, a few miles up the road. Here, Epstein's masterpiece was perched uncomfortably on a chair, looking shagged-out and sweaty, taking a break from being a seminal work of 20th century art. The sculpture was, in fact, a stilt-walker in fancy dress. </p> <p>Designed by architects Caruso St John, the New Art Gallery is a beautiful collection of spaces. The detailing of the building is exquisite, and the articulation of smaller and larger rooms, the internal staircases and interior balconies, make for an entirely pleasurable architectural experience. </p> <p>The gallery is the new permanent home for the Garman Ryan collection. Occupying two floors of the building, this includes parts of Epstein's own collection (those pieces which weren't sold off, on his own insistence, after his death in 1959), and works which his widowed second wife, Kathleen Garman, continued to collect and to deal in with her subsequent partner, Sally Ryan, an American artist who had been Epstein's pupil. </p> <p>Garman came from the Black Country and donated the collection to Walsall; since 1974, it has been housed in Walsall Library. Now it has been installed in a series of interconnecting spaces, unexpectedly clad in Douglas fir. It's like a flashback to the 60s pine kitchen; the effect is actually rather beautiful, intimate and beguiling. </p> <p>The works form an uneven agglomeration. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, and the overall effect reminds one that this was, originally, a domestic and happenstance collection, based around Epstein's own works and his ethnographic collection (much of which was sold), and brought together by luck, life and accident. </p> <p>The works are arranged thematically, which is probably the only way to deal with such an eclectic hotch-potch. Going from room to room, you make your own discoveries. There are some terrific things here: great etchings by Durer, Goya, Manet and Millet, a William Blake watercolour of Christ in the carpenter's shop, and a very iffy remnant of a Titian putti. There's a sombre, lowering Constable landscape in such a horrific gilded frame it looks like a tea-tray. These vie with glutinous and unambitious paintings by Ryan herself, as well as by Garman and Epstein's son, Theo. Just keep going, you tell yourself, it'll get better again in a moment. </p> <p>The collection has many surprises: a tense little G\u00e9ricault male nude, Van Gogh's Sorrow, an angular, self-consciously wracked drawing from 1882, a Matisse, a Renoir. Three Lucien Freud portraits - Freud married Epstein and Garman's daughter Kitty - have a concentration and intensity that stop me in my tracks. </p> <p>It's a bumpy ride, however: here is a little Maori figure, there a Roman head of a mourning woman who has lost her nose (although that's not why she's mourning), in between some Inuit ivories. Epstein's sculpture of Frisky the dog and his portrait bust of TS Eliot are included, but the Epsteins here are mostly footnotes to a career. The collection was donated in a generous spirit, and that's the way we should look at it. Even so, there's enough that's worthwhile here to make one want to return. </p> <p>Classic white walls take over in the temporary exhibition spaces upstairs. Currently hanging is an exhibition dedicated to the colour blue. This isn't terribly useful as an exhibition rubric, but it is a fairly gentle and uncontroversial way to introduce the Walsall public to the pleasures and terrors of modern art. Blue period Picasso meets Damien Hirst dots, an Yves Klein watery veil meets Derek Jarman's intimations of Aids-induced blindness, Bridget Riley does her optical fizz and a great little Miro sings from the wall. Blue isn't a great show by any means, but I'm lulled by all the blueness. </p> <p>Looking out over Walsall's hideous shopping precinct, with the part tithe-barn, part Legoland castle of Woolworths hard by the New Gallery, I'm glad I'm up here rather than down there. Downtown Walsall is as dispiriting as a townscape gets, although artist Richard Wentworth has done something magical with the pedestrianised paving. He has resurfaced the streets and canal towpath in regular stripes of dark tarmac grey and gravel-yellow. Wentworth's intervention - which owes something to Daniel Buren, and something to the spirit of de Chirico - gives the townscape an air of mystery, makes us aware of perspective and distance, dramatises the people unconcernedly walking about on the stripes, which recede along the canal's edge, into a distance you can pace with the eye. The effect is haunting, and makes even Woolworths look peculiarly interesting. </p> <p> A sense of mental place, of the geography of the mind as much as of buildings and landscape, is the key to the exhibition currently at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham. Curated by the artist Tania Kovats, the show is called Lost. Unlike Blue - which is a self-evident catch-all - I'm not sure I entirely get the thesis for this exhibition. Here there is at least a conscious attempt to put together works by different artists which speak to one another in meaningful ways, rather than colour-coding them or arranging them into vaguely universal, totalising themes. And the Ikon has rarely looked better. </p> <p>There's a real point to hanging an Agnes Martin hand-drawn grid (owned by the Tate) near Roni Horn's large metre-and-a-half rectangle of 99% pure gold foil, spread expensively across the floor.

De Cordier has, as far as I know, never been shown in Britain, despite many hopeful curatorial treks through Belgian mud to the artist's remote fastness. His sculpture looks as though it has risen from the earth: it's a tarry, bituminous lump, like a misshapen bowler hat with a fat rubber brim made - so it appears - from the bumper of a dodgem car. This odd, curiously sexual sculpture - part lair, part coat, part female body - is so rich in association and metaphor it deserves an article all to itself.

      "bodyText": "England versus Argentina clashes over the years have always been memorable, either through controversy or because of a moment of magic. Tomorrow's game at Wembley, though only a friendly, should be no exception. June 30, 1998, World Cup second round (St Etienne): England 2 - 2 Argentina (Argentina win on penalties) The match was set alight when Michael Owen first bemused, then bedazzled the Argentinian defence before beating keeper Carlos Roa with a sublime finish. But the clash was overshadowed by David Beckham's act of petulance as he kicked out at Diego Simeone while prone on the ground after being fouled. The incident led to his sending off and widespread condemnation as England, despite a heroic rearguard performance through extra-time, crashed out to penalties. June 22, 1986, World Cup quarter-finals (Mexico City): England 1 - 2 Argentina Famous for Diego Maradona's controversial \"hand of God\" goal and his ravishing run at the England defence and finish. The 114,000 crowd inside the Azteca and the millions more around the world witnessed him punch the ball into the net ahead of Peter Shilton's lunge. The Tunisian referee Ali Ben Nasser missed the blatant cheating. Four minutes later there was no need for subterfuge as Maradona's talent exploded. After picking the ball up near the halfway line, with power, grace and almost condescending ease, he evaded three tackles before dummying Shilton and sliding the ball home. England responded through Gary Lineker nine minutes from time. But it was too little too late. July 23, 1966, World Cup quarter-final (Wembley): England 1 - 0 Argentina The game which led to then England manager Sir Alf Ramsey describing the Argentinians as \"animals\" as they spat, tugged hair, poked fingers in eyes and kicked throughout a brutal encounter. All hell broke loose inside half an hour when Antonio Rattin, who had spat in front of referee Rudolf Kreitlein, questioned every decision of the German referee and fouled all those who crossed his path, was eventually sent off. It took eight minutes to quell the mayhem which followed as Rattin first refused to go, while the Argentinians threatened to walk off in protest. Order was finally restored to a match in which Geoff Hurst finally made England's numerical advantage count 13 minutes from time. May 9, 1951, friendly (Wembley): England 2 - 1 Argentina England met South American opposition at Wembley for the first time - they were only the second country (after Scotland) to play at the world-famous venue. Despite England dominating the early stages, they were constantly denied by eccentric goalkeeper Rugilo. Argentina scored with their only serious attack of the first half and they held the lead until the 79th minute, but Stan Mortensen and Jackie Milburn netted late on to preserve England's unbeaten home record against foreign teams.

But executives also promise cost cuts of \u00a3250m a year within 18 months. The often divisive issue of executive positions in the boardroom and corporate succession has already been agreed. Mr Scott will head the company until he retires next year when Mr Harvey will take over. A new bonus scheme will be installed to offer incentives to managers to work towards the successful integration of the two companies. Although neither CGU, which unveiled profits of \u00a3771m for last year and whose investors will own 58.8% of the enlarged corporation, nor Norwich Union has yet talked to any major shareholders about the deal, some institutional investors are known to be unhappy that the deal does not provide any premium to the Norwich Union share price which is barely above the levels at which it was floated three years ago. Big shareholders are also keen for cash bids which will allow them to take money out of the unpopular financial sector and plough it into the fashionable telecoms, media and technology sectors. But Roman Cizdyn at Merrill Lynch said: \"The companies have recognised that they must be bigger. They are both quite lean machines so should achieve good cost savings.\"",

Whatever one thinks of the sheer fluency of the orchestral writing in the Eighth, inspired by Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, there's sometimes too much of it; especially in the galumphing scherzo there are passages that overstay their welcome. Yet the BBC Symphony made light of those congested moments, and the exuberance and honesty of the writing, as in so much Henze, triumphs in the end. </p> <p> ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",
