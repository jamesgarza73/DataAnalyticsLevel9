It's a world where the contributions of employees at all levels, including support staff, are truly valued and proven in the form of regular meaty cheques. A utopian dream that's about as likely as John Prescott trading in his Jaguars for a couple of Minis? Not for almost 200 employees at Chase de Vere, a firm of independent financial advisers, who will share a \u00a341m payout as a result of its acquisition by the Bank of Ireland. </p> <p>Although the exact reward depends on length of service and performance, administration staff who have been with the company 10 or 15 years could expect a staggering \u00a330,000 each. \"One of the things we've recognised over recent years is that admin staff can be undervalued. Since they are increasingly key in our organisation, we have been looking at ways to change that,\" explains Nigel Mitchell, managing director of Chase de Vere. </p> <p>Similar displays of appreciation for support staff are gaining popularity across the country, claims Nick Page, adviser on pay and employment conditions at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). \"Admittedly, rewards still go overwhelmingly to key directors and managers, and loyalty pay-outs tend to be much smaller at secretarial level,\" he says. \"But the rise in mergers and acquisitions, and the fear of talented staff heading off to a company that offers greater benefits, means employers have had to think carefully about incentives for staff at all levels.\" </p> <p>Take Goldman Sachs' recent handout. Although it was the investment bank's partners who went home a few million pounds richer following the firm's flotation on the stock market last year, all employees - including the 200 secretaries working in the London offices - were rewarded with shares equivalent to at least half their salaries. Extra loyalty bonuses went to long-serving staff. A secretary earning \u00a325,000 received shares worth \u00a312,500 in June 1999 - since when the share price has almost doubled. </p> <p>In fact, rewards in the form of shares have become particularly prevalent since the shake-up of employee share ownership rules in the budget last March. \"One of the aims of this government is to spread share ownership across organisations rather than keeping it at the top,\" explains Page. Under the All Employee Share Ownership Plan (Aesop), workers can receive up to \u00a33,000 of free shares a year from employers, which are given tax incentives to introduce such a scheme. </p> <p>Organisations such as John Lewis go a step further. \"Everyone who works here, whatever their role, is a partner; a beneficiary of the trust,\" explains a spokesperson. \"What that means for our 40,000 staff is that they all do their utmost to get profits continually on the up because they will gain directly.\" Profit payouts are annual and this year partners received a bonus of 15% of their salary, the equivalent of eight weeks' wages. </p> <p>And it's not only the big players which are rewarding secretaries for their talents. Michaelides and Bednash, a London-based media strategy company with 18 staff, is one of a number of smaller firms setting themselves up as partnerships. \"People feel motivated, dedicated, appreciated and ultimately they contribute more,\" says George Michaelides, managing partner. </p> <p>The Industrial Society believes new-style suggestion schemes are one of the key ways in which secretaries can be shown that they are valued. Barely recognisable from their predecessors, which were aimed chiefly at managers and directors, the latest schemes offer substantial incentives to all staff. According to Julian Richer, who has been instrumental in setting up suggestion schemes in companies such as the Halifax and Asda, \"Employers gain by getting good ideas and employees gain by being rewarded for having them. It shows employees that their input is important and that they are considered as essential members of the organisation.\" </p> <p>In both the companies Richer has worked with, the basic award - which is given to anyone who sends in a suggestion, no matter how small or unworkable - is \u00a35. \"The idea is to create a culture where people are encouraged to put ideas forward. If it's not viable, but a good try, they get a tenner. The next step up is \u00a315 for an idea that's worth serious consideration, and so on.\" Awards of up to \u00a35,000 for big ideas are tax-free. </p> <p>Nevertheless, points out the Industrial Society, there is a danger that the top payouts are concentrated in areas such as IT where ideas may get more direct, fast and measurable results. \"Ideas that cut costs in administration can be equally, if not more valuable, and should be recognised as such,\" says a spokesperson. </p> <p>Likewise, support staff should beware of bonuses that come in the form of \"retention payments\", warns the society. For instance, staff who have worked at the Millennium Dome for two years or more have been offered the equivalent of a month's extra salary which they will receive at the end of the year when contracts run out. \"A lot of my colleagues think it's a bonus,\" says one employee. \"But in truth, it's a way of keeping us here until our contracts finish - at a very low cost to our employers.\" </p> <p>Little wonder, says Dr Jane Sturges, a research fellow at London University's Birkbeck College, that increasing numbers of employees - particularly women - are beginning to demand alternative incentives such as career breaks, parental support, flexible working and training in transferable skills. \"They've realised that employers are prepared to reward them. But they want rewards that are exactly what they seem and that correspond with their lifestyle,\" explains Sturges, who has studied this trend. \"With fewer management levels and less money available in many companies, employers are only too pleased to comply,\" she adds. \"They want to keep staff but they can't afford the sums paid out by the likes of Chase de Vere.\" </p> <p>Consider advertising agency Grey London which offers employees Friday afternoons off in the summer. Likewise, PR consultancy Text 100 offers \"Duvet Days\": employees can take extra days off when they can't bring themselves to crawl from under the sheets. \"Our research has shown that secretaries and PAs are decreasingly motivated by external benefits and instead prefer the chance to take longer holidays or work shorter hours,\" confirms Angela Baron, policy adviser for the CIPD. </p> <p>Oracle, a Reading-based software company, is offering flexible benefit schemes that can be tailored to different requirements. The employee enters the computerised \"menu\" and selects a cash bonus or equivalent in annual leave, child-care vouchers or whatever else takes their fancy. \"There is a huge interest in this type of product,\" claims Vance Kearney, vice-president of HR at Oracle. \"We've witnessed a significant fall in staff turnover since it was introduced.\" </p> <p>Ben Williams, a chartered psychologist, is not surprised. \"Money does not have a lasting effect as a definition of success,\" he insists. \"Once people get used to their new salary or payouts, they start to expect more again, and become resentful if it doesn't happen. So, rather than being a benefit, monetary rewards can even work as a punishment.\" But those support staff currently savouring their first taste of the world of bonuses and loyalty payouts should enjoy it. The fat cat secretary is a long way off.</p>",

But I did work on the new appeal for information on her murder a year later,\" says Woods. </p> <p>Woods has been working towards a career at the BBC for some time. At the age of 15, she already knew that she wanted a job in the media. \"My mum worked as a fundraiser at a hospital and I became involved with hospital radio. I was presenting my own show at the age of 16 - playing records, doing competitions for the kids and 70s request shows for the adults in the evenings,\" she says. </p> <p>She went on to do a degree in journalism at Cardiff University. \"Landing a job at Crimewatch was really bizarre because I had studied it at university as part of a module on crime, violence and the mass media, and it was one of my final exam papers,\" she explains. But she soon discovered that reality and academia are two very different worlds. \"You learn more on the inside than you ever do at university,\" she says. </p> <p>It was as a temp two years ago that Woods got her foot in the door of the BBC, working in various departments, including Radio 4, Live and Kicking and The Millennium Programme. While doing a stint on the Watchdog team, she took the initiative and handed in her CV for any future positions that might arise. She was promptly interviewed by her current boss and given the position in the crime and reconstruction unit at Crimewatch. </p> <p>Woods admits that working for such a dynamic boss feeds her own ambition. \"Sita's very intelligent, very fast-paced and is often three steps ahead of herself. Initially, it was quite hard to adjust to her because previously I had been working in a very laid-back environment. Sita is constantly, constantly busy. She keeps me on my toes and I've learnt more in the past six months than I have in the past two years.\" </p> <p>Keeping track of an active boss is a large part of Woods's job and schedules have to be constantly updated and reorganised. Meetings with police officers and programme controllers have to be timetabled around searches for actors to take part in crime reconstruction scenes. Crimewatch is compulsive viewing - Woods describes it as \"fascinating and disturbing\" - and around 7m viewers watch each month in the hope of solving some of the country's most high-profile crimes. On the air for 16 years, the programme is effective enough to result in one arrest for every three cases covered. </p> <p>Woods explains that it is usually the police who decide which unsolved crimes need the help and attention of the public. The programme goes out live and she rarely knows in advance what she will be doing on the night. \"It depends largely on how many extra pairs of hands we get. Sometimes I'll have to help with the phone lines. Often I'll be collecting the call sheets and feeding them back to the production desk, making sure that the right people are getting the right calls so that no information is missed. You don't want vital information left sitting there. Urgent calls need to be fed back out onto the studio floor and to the police who are dealing with the case,\" she says. </p> <p>Only a few months into her job, Woods is already on her way up the career ladder. She was recently chosen to train as a production secretary and her duties will now include location-scouting for shoots. She will be required to work closely with researchers on cases that have to be investigated, which means keeping a vigilant eye on news and current affairs for reported crimes and the development of unsolved cases. </p> <p>Asked what fuels her ambition Woods explains, \"I absolutely love my job and I love the environment that I'm in, so that drives me on to succeed further.

In the long run, how ever, it might be unwise to be too tight-fisted when it comes to employees' comfort. The working environment has a direct effect on productivity and 78% of bosses who responded to the survey agreed that a pleasant office is a major influence in attracting and retaining good-quality workers.

Many of us have witnessed a situation where two extra staff are recruited at short notice and forced to share a desk that was formerly the repository for dirty mugs and is now blocking the fire escape.

According to a report by Timotei, the hair-care brand, 41% of people spend their day in an air-conditioned or centrally heated building and this figure rises dramatically to 81% in London, where 44% of people can't even see out of a window. </p> <p>As our working environment has such an enormous effect on our health and mental wellbeing, what can we do to help ourselves when our surroundings are less than perfect?

The company said it had the resources to operate into September, giving it more time to attract for a rescue bid. </p> <p>\"We're feeling cautiously optimistic that an extra month of operation might give us enough time to conclude negotiations with one of the many blue-chip white knights who have made approaches this week,\" co-founder Robert Norton said in a written statement. </p> <p>The company said traffic on the site, which was begun in April 2000, had quadrupled over the past week and sales had increased by 20%. </p> <p>With investors taking a more hard-nosed view of internet stocks following the share price mania at the end of last year, Clickmango became the latest victim of the new mood when it said it was winding down its business in order to pay staff and creditors in full. </p> <p>Atlas Venture, which last September provided the bulk of the \u00a33m Clickmango needed to set up and operate for a year, decided to pull the plug at a time when prospects for e-retailers are looking exceedingly grim. </p> <p>Mr Norton said the company had been unable to raise some \u00a3300,000 in bridging finance. </p> <p>Clickmango's woes are the latest in a series of blows to confidence in Britain's internet sector, with business-to-consumer firms facing particular uncertainty after the collapse earlier this year of high-spending fashion retailer Boo.com. </p> <p>The company hired actress Joanna Lumley, who plays Patsy Stone in television comedy Absolutely Fabulous, to endorse its site.

After announcing last week that it was ceasing trading, Clickmango said the attitude of its main creditors and the loyalty of its 20 staff allowed it a stay of execution. The company said it had the resources to operate into September, giving it more time to attract for a rescue bid. \"We're feeling cautiously optimistic that an extra month of operation might give us enough time to conclude negotiations with one of the many blue-chip white knights who have made approaches this week,\" co-founder Robert Norton said in a written statement. The company said traffic on the site, which was begun in April 2000, had quadrupled over the past week and sales had increased by 20%. With investors taking a more hard-nosed view of internet stocks following the share price mania at the end of last year, Clickmango became the latest victim of the new mood when it said it was winding down its business in order to pay staff and creditors in full. Atlas Venture, which last September provided the bulk of the \u00a33m Clickmango needed to set up and operate for a year, decided to pull the plug at a time when prospects for e-retailers are looking exceedingly grim. Mr Norton said the company had been unable to raise some \u00a3300,000 in bridging finance. Clickmango's woes are the latest in a series of blows to confidence in Britain's internet sector, with business-to-consumer firms facing particular uncertainty after the collapse earlier this year of high-spending fashion retailer Boo.com. The company hired actress Joanna Lumley, who plays Patsy Stone in television comedy Absolutely Fabulous, to endorse its site. Mr Norton founded the company with Toby Rowland, son of the late tycoon \"Tiny\" Rowland.",

But she also experiences Dionysian ecstasy with the sexy snapper by whom she is eventually abandoned. And in a similar way the ghostly Agnes is impregnated and then discarded by the house's master, reducing her, in Victorian terms, to the status of an abandoned woman.

A tribesman, wearing only a codpiece and feathers in his hair, stamps his spear and utters a deep moan. An old man in soiled shorts steps forward, pointing to bullet wounds in his thigh and foot.</p> <p>Rain suddenly sweeps in across the valley, hammering on the tin-roof missionary's house at the foot of the ridge. Everyone scrambles for the shelter below. Erson's words now compete with rain on the tin roof: 'They hacked the bodies before they threw them into the holes.'</p> <p>For the first time, the full horror of Indonesian rule in Irian Jaya (or West Papua, as Papuans prefer to call it) is emerging.</p> <p>For more than 30 years Jakarta fought a dirty war against the rebel group OPM and anyone thought to sympathise with them. Thousands are thought to have died.</p> <p>Only now are villagers like Erson coming forward to have their reports documented by human rights workers in the highland capital of Wamena. 'We're not scared any more. Before, if you as much as mentioned the rebels you'd be killed. People would be terrorised for as much as writing down their name. People were scared to even use the word Papua,' says Yafet Yelemaken, who is gathering the evidence.</p> <p>Years of repression now fuel an urgent desire for independence. The Baliem Valley is technically still an area of military operations, but suddenly the hated Indonesian military has disappeared. All along the bumpy road that threads through the valley, villagers have set up their own security posts. Groups of men in bare feet and tattered clothes spring to attention as strangers approach.</p> <p>They brandish the ancient weapons of the Dani tribe that dominates this valley: bows and arrows, spears and crude knives.</p> <p>Veteran members of the OPM, whooping and waving, emerge from the hills, like men from another age. They wear elaborate feathered head-dresses and enormous gourds over their loins. Their necklaces of giant boar's teeth glint as the valley is again bathed in sunshine.</p> <p>'We're not afraid. Not now,' they insist. Some of those we spoke to thought West Papua was already independent. Later, at Wamena's ramshackle airport, I sat between a naked tribesman wanting to sell me a necklace and a villager taking her child for medical treatment in the capital, Jayapura. It was funny, said the woman, so many strangers - single Javanese men - had arrived in Wamena recently, yet there seemed to be no work for them.</p> <p>It was a throwaway comment, and I thought nothing of it at the time. After all, the Baliem Valley seemed to have already thrown off the Indonesian shackles.</p> <p>In Jayapura the independence movement organised its most forthright challenge yet. Hundreds flooded the city centre last week for the raising of the outlawed Morning Star flag. The only sign of Indonesian authority was a solitary and bemused traffic policeman.</p> <p>Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid has said he will never let Irian Jaya go. Yet in the valley and here in Jayapura it looked too late, as black-clad militiamen, forbidden flags on their breasts, paraded openly.</p> <p>These men policed the port with sticks and knives when a refugee ship arrived from Ambon. The atmosphere was tense, and at first nobody was allowed ashore. The few eventually permitted to land for medical treatment were escorted, menacingly, by those same militiamen.</p> <p>One pro-Indonesian businessmen was reportedly kidnapped and beaten by militia men. Chinese shop owners have been threatened.</p> <p>At the local human rights office, long-standing critics of Indonesia's heavy-handed rule were deeply uneasy, drawing parallels with strife-torn Ambon and East Timor.</p> <p>'This is a time-bomb waiting to explode. I'm afraid it's all going to end in tragedy,' said Albert Rumbekwan, one activist. And then cryptically: 'Why are we accepting favours from our enemies?' Among those 'favours' is cash for the black-clad militia, from an unlikely, but disturbing source. The self-proclaimed 'Big Leader' of the West Papua independence movement,who runs the militia, is 62-year-old Theys Eluay, a tall, imposing man with a shock of white hair and a taste for loud jackets and ties. He was once a member of the ruling Golkar party and voted for integration with Indonesia in a dubious 1969 plebiscite of local leaders. For 30 years, he kept quiet about Indonesia's human rights abuses.</p> <p>More sinister is his main source of money: Yorris Raweyai, deputy head of an Indonesian youth organisation with close ties to the Indonesian army and ex-President Suharto.</p> <p>Yorris's youth organisation is involved in gambling, prostitution and protection rackets. In the past it was used by the military for the dirty work that they preferred to avoid: Yorris is awaiting trial over an attack in 1996 on the headquarters of Megawati Sukharnoputri, then an opposition leader.</p> <p>Now it is his money funding Eluay, his West Papuan separatist movement and their black-clad militia, called Satgas (Taskforce), and now claimed to be 7,000 strong.</p> <p>Why is it being accepted? 'The people are hungry for freedom, and that seems to matter more to them than the personalities fighting for it,' says human rights activist Albert Rumbekwan.</p> <p>More worrying, Rumbekwan's office has received reports of rival 'red and white' militias, loyal to Jakarta, being trained by the military in other cities. At least one clash has been reported. Jakarta is boosting the number of troops in the province, they claim. I thought again about the woman at Wamena airport and her story of those single Javanese men arriving.</p> <p>Unlike East Timor, or Ambon, Irian Jaya has rich reserves of minerals and metals. The Grasberg mine, in the mountains of this wild province, has the world's biggest gold deposit. Freeport McMoran, the American firm that runs it, is Indonesia's single biggest taxpayer.</p> <p>Economically, the province is vital to Indonesia. The fear among human rights groups in Jayapura is that some powers in Jakarta want to create conditions to justify a military crackdown here or to unleash chaos to undermine President Wahid's dwindling credibility.The parallels with East Timor and Ambon are frightening indeed.</p> <p>\u0095 Ian Williams is Channel 4 News Asia Correspondent.

Before, if you as much as mentioned the rebels you'd be killed. People would be terrorised for as much as writing down their name. People were scared to even use the word Papua,' says Yafet Yelemaken, who is gathering the evidence. Years of repression now fuel an urgent desire for independence. The Baliem Valley is technically still an area of military operations, but suddenly the hated Indonesian military has disappeared. All along the bumpy road that threads through the valley, villagers have set up their own security posts. Groups of men in bare feet and tattered clothes spring to attention as strangers approach. They brandish the ancient weapons of the Dani tribe that dominates this valley: bows and arrows, spears and crude knives. Veteran members of the OPM, whooping and waving, emerge from the hills, like men from another age. They wear elaborate feathered head-dresses and enormous gourds over their loins. Their necklaces of giant boar's teeth glint as the valley is again bathed in sunshine. 'We're not afraid. Not now,' they insist. Some of those we spoke to thought West Papua was already independent. Later, at Wamena's ramshackle airport, I sat between a naked tribesman wanting to sell me a necklace and a villager taking her child for medical treatment in the capital, Jayapura. It was funny, said the woman, so many strangers - single Javanese men - had arrived in Wamena recently, yet there seemed to be no work for them. It was a throwaway comment, and I thought nothing of it at the time. After all, the Baliem Valley seemed to have already thrown off the Indonesian shackles. In Jayapura the independence movement organised its most forthright challenge yet. Hundreds flooded the city centre last week for the raising of the outlawed Morning Star flag. The only sign of Indonesian authority was a solitary and bemused traffic policeman. Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid has said he will never let Irian Jaya go. Yet in the valley and here in Jayapura it looked too late, as black-clad militiamen, forbidden flags on their breasts, paraded openly. These men policed the port with sticks and knives when a refugee ship arrived from Ambon. The atmosphere was tense, and at first nobody was allowed ashore. The few eventually permitted to land for medical treatment were escorted, menacingly, by those same militiamen. One pro-Indonesian businessmen was reportedly kidnapped and beaten by militia men. Chinese shop owners have been threatened. At the local human rights office, long-standing critics of Indonesia's heavy-handed rule were deeply uneasy, drawing parallels with strife-torn Ambon and East Timor. 'This is a time-bomb waiting to explode. I'm afraid it's all going to end in tragedy,' said Albert Rumbekwan, one activist. And then cryptically: 'Why are we accepting favours from our enemies?' Among those 'favours' is cash for the black-clad militia, from an unlikely, but disturbing source. The self-proclaimed 'Big Leader' of the West Papua independence movement,who runs the militia, is 62-year-old Theys Eluay, a tall, imposing man with a shock of white hair and a taste for loud jackets and ties. He was once a member of the ruling Golkar party and voted for integration with Indonesia in a dubious 1969 plebiscite of local leaders. For 30 years, he kept quiet about Indonesia's human rights abuses. More sinister is his main source of money: Yorris Raweyai, deputy head of an Indonesian youth organisation with close ties to the Indonesian army and ex-President Suharto. Yorris's youth organisation is involved in gambling, prostitution and protection rackets. In the past it was used by the military for the dirty work that they preferred to avoid: Yorris is awaiting trial over an attack in 1996 on the headquarters of Megawati Sukharnoputri, then an opposition leader. Now it is his money funding Eluay, his West Papuan separatist movement and their black-clad militia, called Satgas (Taskforce), and now claimed to be 7,000 strong. Why is it being accepted? 'The people are hungry for freedom, and that seems to matter more to them than the personalities fighting for it,' says human rights activist Albert Rumbekwan. More worrying, Rumbekwan's office has received reports of rival 'red and white' militias, loyal to Jakarta, being trained by the military in other cities. At least one clash has been reported. Jakarta is boosting the number of troops in the province, they claim. I thought again about the woman at Wamena airport and her story of those single Javanese men arriving. Unlike East Timor, or Ambon, Irian Jaya has rich reserves of minerals and metals. The Grasberg mine, in the mountains of this wild province, has the world's biggest gold deposit. Freeport McMoran, the American firm that runs it, is Indonesia's single biggest taxpayer. Economically, the province is vital to Indonesia. The fear among human rights groups in Jayapura is that some powers in Jakarta want to create conditions to justify a military crackdown here or to unleash chaos to undermine President Wahid's dwindling credibility.The parallels with East Timor and Ambon are frightening indeed. \u0095 Ian Williams is Channel 4 News Asia Correspondent. His film on West Papua will be shown on Sunday at 6.30pm.",

The words are those of Kathleen, daughter of a republican activist, addressed to her father a quarter of a century after his death. Hers is one of 70 stories, told in the first person, contained in Bear in Mind, a timely and harrowing reminder of the legacy of suffering with which thousands of people in Northern Ireland still have to cope. The testimony comes from all sides. A young mother remembers giving birth in prison and the pain when her baby was taken away. A small boy is beaten up because he is wearing a Glasgow Rangers shirt. A British soldier returns to the Creggan estate in Derry and tries to find the 15-year-old sniper who nearly killed him. A Chinese family is driven out of its home because the English wife of one of its members is a Catholic. A schoolboy is warned never, ever, to reveal that his father is in the RUC. These stories have been compiled and published by An Crann/The Tree, an organisation set up in 1994 by the poet Damian Gorman. It is dedicated 'to helping people to tell and hear the splintered, complex and often contradictory stories of The Troubles'. The Belfast Agreement specifically recognised the need to deal, in human terms, with 'the deep and profoundly regrettable' legacy of suffering left by 30 years of violence. More than 3,000 victims died during those years, but tens of thousands of people have been affected directly, either through injury or the loss of a loved one. Those who work with these victims say that they suffer enormous anxiety when the peace process is seen to falter, fearing a return to the violence of the past. Last weekend, when 78 paramilitary prisoners - some of whom had been responsible for appalling atrocities - walked free from the Maze was a particularily difficult time for the victims and their relatives. Some of them, like Rita Restorick whose son was the last British soldier to be killed in Northern Ireland, have shown enormous courage in accepting that the early release of prisoners is a necessary part of the peace process. But many people find this impossible. William Frazier of South Armagh, who lost five members of his family in the conflict, said 'These terrorists, who are seen as heroes, will be out partying while we try to comfort people who are in tears.' The British and Irish Governments know that this bitterness and grief has to be dealt with if the past is ever to be laid to rest. Both Governments have established commissions to examine ways of doing this. Some of the recommendations are simply practical, for example that a great deal more money needs to be spent on compensation and on providing support such as bereavement counselling, retraining and so on. There is also a deeper psychological problem in offering official recognition of the suffering of the past 30 years. The editors of Bear in Mind quote Lionel Chircop: 'Because what is forgotten cannot be healed, and that which cannot be healed easily becomes the source of greater evil.' It has been suggested that there should be some permanent memorial to record the names of all those who have died. This in itself has provoked division. The families of those who have died as the result of terrorist violence are appalled at the idea that the perpetrators of violence should be remembered alongside their victims. Those who have suffered at the hands of the security forces are equally adamant that members of the British Army and the security forces should not be included.

      "bodyText": "One of Russia's leading environmentalists intends to sue President Vladimir Putin in an attempt to prove that his decree abolishing an environmental protection agency was a violation of the constitution and has proved disastrous for the country. In the two months since Putin disbanded the State Committee for the Environment, shrewd industrialists have begun to take advantage of the disappearance of the official ecological watchdog to launch projects and sell off natural resources in deals which would never previously have been approved, activists said yesterday. The lawsuit represents a desperate attempt by the head of the environmental legal firm Ecojuris, Vera Mishchenko, to force the president to reinstate the committee. 'The destruction has already begun. This country no longer has an organisation empowered to stop the exploitation of the environment by companies who are simply out to make money quickly; some organisations have already started making the most of the new situation. If this goes on, the long-term environmental harm will be huge,' Mishchenko said. News of the protection body's abolition in May prompted international condemnation. Environmental pressure groups were particularly alarmed by the Russian government's decision to hand the committee's functions over to the Ministry of Natural Resources, the body responsible for licensing the commercial exploitation of natural resources. This merger created an instant clash between those officials working to make a profit from Russia's abundant timber, oil and mineral stocks, and those labouring to protect and preserve the country's forests and plains. Arguing that the government had created a serious conflict of interest, the head of the now defunct environment committee, Viktor Dan-ilov-Danilyan, said: 'Authorising the Natural Resources Ministry to deal with ecological problems is like asking an alcoholic what the price of vodka should be. It's a signal for thieves, because the law is effectively saying: \"Hey, everyone! There's no one watching over the environment - so come on and take what you want\".' The abolition of the only agency designed to deal with environmental issues comes at a time when Russia has an overwhelmingly wide variety of ecological disaster situations to contend with. The collapse of the military-defence industry has left a decaying nuclear arsenal; decades of lax legislation have caused chemical poisoning of developed regions; the largely unregulated timber industry is causing the rapid destruction of forests. 'The scale of the ecological problems with which we are already burdened is such that, if strict controls are not maintained, they could swiftly develop to prompt a global ecological crisis. Russia will suffer, but other countries will also be unable to protect themselves from the consequences,' warned Yev-geny Usov from Greenpeace's Moscow office. Government officials have yet to explain why they chose to disband the environment committee. Some commentators speculated that it was a cost-cutting venture; others suggested that officials close to Putin had responded to heavy pressure from the powerful domestic mining, oil and timber lobbies. The abolition proved so unpopular that the new Prime Minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, quickly launched a review into whether the presidential decree had been wise. He was due to announce the review's findings last month, but no details were announced and no public discussion has occurred. Mishchenko said if her lawsuit against the President failed, she would attempt to sue the government, failing which she would open a case against the Natural Resources Ministry. If this also proved unsuccessful she would approach the European Court of Human Rights. 'I'm trying to remain optimistic that we will be able to reverse the decree,' she said. Usov added: 'If our government has a brain, if they are at all capable of rational thought, then this decision will be withdrawn.'",

      "bodyText": "A mid-air collision between passenger planes is 'waiting to happen' in the skies over Britain, air traffic controllers warned yesterday. The antiquated computer system that will be forced to handle two million flights in UK airspace this year is close to breaking point. And controllers at the West Drayton centre near Heathrow are under so much pressure to fit more aircraft into the same chunk of sky that many believe safety margins are being dangerously squeezed. According to information passed to The Observer , some senior controllers fear it is only a matter of time before there is a serious accident. One has even said he is 'certain' there will be a mid-air smash 'this year' - if pressure on the system is not eased. One West Drayton controller said yesterday that the system was packed with aircraft taking off, landing and passing overhead from before 6am until after 9pm every day and he and his colleagues 'take a hammering all the time' on the busiest sky sectors. He said: 'Controllers live on their wits. Of course there is not a general sense of everyone walking around here waiting for something to happen, but people do feel when they come out [from a shift] that they have been through the mangle and went to the absolute limit.' Staff feel that in such situations the margins for error are being squeezed and, he added, 'we sometimes feel we are not in control'. The controller said he had had three incidents in 'just the past few weeks' of pilots arriving from the US misunderstanding altitude information given by West Drayton and, as a result, descending below the limit separating aircraft approaching Heathrow with those taking off from nearby London City Airport. The air traffic control (ATC) computer at West Drayton failed with virtually no warning last month after it reached a pre-programmed traffic limit that had been set during efforts to upgrade it. The system, parts of which date back to the Fifties, was meant to be replaced by a \u00a3425 million state-of-the-art centre at Swanwick, Hampshire, in 1996. But computer glitches mean costs have soared to \u00a3623m and the centre will now not open until 2001. Airports in the South-east are also overstretched. Last month a controller complained to the official Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (Chirp), which is taken very seriously by the airline industry and the Government, that lip service was being paid to the concept that safety was paramount by politicians and air traffic control managers. 'We no longer have the runway capacity we need to provide the safety margins that are necessary,' he said in the Chirp report. Too many aircraft are forced to 'stack' - fly in holding patterns while waiting to land. And an aviation source told The Observer that landing clearance, especially at Heathrow, is sometimes not given to pilots until a jet is virtually on the ground and the runway has barely been cleared of the plane in front. This allows no time to abort. Chirp reported that 'it is not uncommon' for the standard separation of four miles between Boeing 757 aircraft, which are quite slow on their final approach, to go as low as 2.5 miles at touchdown. Another controller told Chirp that design flaws with a new radio system had, on several occasions left him without communications. He said: 'I feel a serious failure of the system is imminent without rapid improvement and I am in no way alone in this view that a serious safety issue is at stake now.' A spokesman for National Air Traffic Services, the branch of the Civil Aviation Authority which runs UK ATC and is in line for privatisation, said the radio telecommunications problems raised in Chirp had now been fixed. He said 1999-2000 was a record low year for flight delays and risk-related air proximity incidents caused by ATC. And the rate at which controllers reported the system was 'overloaded' was not increasing, he said. Ian Findlay, aviation officer for the IPMS white collar union, said the ATC system was under more pressure than ever but had proved effective in preventing accidents. But he said: 'There are controllers who tell me the system is at breaking point and something needs to give.' He said controllers' 'great fear' was that safety margins would be 'further eroded' if air traffic control was managed in the private sector.

Even if the Conservatives were leading the Government in the polls at this point, I would forecast you to lose the election.</p> <p>But, as you know, Central Office's private polls, which are broadly in line with the newspaper ones, still give the Government a substantial, usually double-digit, lead, which is actually increasing as the political world retreats to the villas and vine groves. At this stage of the parliament, every other government since 1945 was behind the Opposition. The only exception was Margaret Thatcher, in the afterglow of victory in the Falklands against a split Opposition. This means that, speaking simply statistically, you lead the least successful, most hopeless Opposition in more than half a century. My job is not to cheer you up.</p> <p>You would not know what a failure you are if you read some of the right-wing newspapers. After being ridiculed for the first two years of your leadership, the same editors and columnists who derided you as a dead parrot are now boosting you as a man of steel. As the poet said, disaster and triumph, treat these impostors the same. Don't let a few gee-up editorials turn your head. This has happened not because the reptiles have suddenly discovered William Jefferson Hague's hitherto concealed superhuman qualities. It's because you have been running with their daily agenda, and fit into their deeper programme. The hacks need a drama, some sense that there is at least the possibility of a change of government, to flog their rags to the punters. The proprietors, for their own, dark purposes, want to keep Ministers dangling and begging. I know how desperate you are to win back the Sun . They will flirt with us, I am sure. But at the crunch? My best guess is that, so long as New Labour looks a winner, Rupert Murdoch will swallow his hatred of Europe and vote Blair again at the next election.</p> <p>Incidentally, I wouldn't bet the ranch on the euro. It matters to the voters, but nothing like as much as health, education and the economy. Then again, looking at our other policies, maybe there is nothing else to bet on but the euro. New Labour is going to pound us - see their health-service poster campaign this week - on the \u00a316 billion of spending cuts we've stupidly suggested. Tory cuts, Tory cuts, Tory cuts. That will be New Labour's mantra from here to polling day. Worse, Conservatives can't even then say which taxes they would reduce. Tories look like hypocrites when they attack petrol prices but then equivocate about whether they would actually reduce fuel duty.</p> <p>The Conservative brand is still, to borrow a phrase from Philip Gould, badly contaminated. Frankly, it is highly toxic. I'd swap New Labour's problems for our problems any day of the week. People have not forgotten how incompetent, sleazy, greedy and quarrelsome we were when last let loose on the country. And be sure that New Labour will remind them.</p> <p>Something I will grant you. You have managed to make us sound harder, at the cost of making us look more unpleasant. Ivan Massow's defection to Labour is a blow. Ivan who? you will protest. Yes, most of the voters won't have much of a clue or a care about the gay millionaire. But he is emblematic of the way your decision to swing to the authoritarian Right has alienated a vital constituency for us - people who combine a belief in the free markets with social toleration.</p> <p>Calling us 'less compassionate, more intolerant and just plain nasty' isn't Massow's most damaging charge. There's worse than his suggestion that you are stirring up racism and homophobia. The lethal accusation, which we both know to be a bit too horribly close to the truth, is that you really don't believe in any of this crude, prejudicial stuff. You are not really a racist or a homophobe. Some of your best friends etc... this is just a pose to pander for votes. So much for W Hague, man of principle.</p> <p>Yes, I'm afraid I have to get personal. You are a dreadful liability. We had to stop asking our focus groups what they thought about you because the responses were so rude that no one in the office dared report it back. You are less highly rated as a potential Prime Minister than Neil Kinnock at his worst. Brutally, you fail the close-your-eyes-test. When people close their eyes, they simply cannot visualise you standing outside Number 10. Not without bursting into hysterical laughter.</p> <p>We are going to hear a lot of the phrase 'Prime Minister Hague' in the run-up to the election. Not from Tories, but from New Labour. Usually, it is regarded as bad practice to give your opponent the benefit of suggesting that he might win. They are going to make an exception in your case in order to scare the country to the polls to vote Labour.</p> <p>The consolation, at least for your prospects of remaining as Tory leader, is that the rest of the Shadow Cabinet is even more wildly unpopular. The public have no idea who most of this collection of nonentities are, and are allergic to those of them that they can put a handle on. Ann Widdecombe has her followers, but I know you work on the assumption that even the Conservative Party isn't barking enough to make her leader. The excellent news from your point of view is that Michael Portillo seems to have lost the plot, disappeared with virtually no trace, leaving behind just a faint whiff of hair oil.</p> <p>I always understood it to be your strategy not to think of trying to win the next election and concentrate on just doing well to survive as Leader of the Opposition to fight the election after. That is why you put in place all those complicated changes to leadership contests to make a post-election challenge much harder. In that sense, in the sense that your strategy is predicated on being a loser, everything is still going to plan.</p>",

You are not really a racist or a homophobe. Some of your best friends etc... this is just a pose to pander for votes. So much for W Hague, man of principle. Yes, I'm afraid I have to get personal. You are a dreadful liability. We had to stop asking our focus groups what they thought about you because the responses were so rude that no one in the office dared report it back. You are less highly rated as a potential Prime Minister than Neil Kinnock at his worst. Brutally, you fail the close-your-eyes-test. When people close their eyes, they simply cannot visualise you standing outside Number 10. Not without bursting into hysterical laughter. We are going to hear a lot of the phrase 'Prime Minister Hague' in the run-up to the election. Not from Tories, but from New Labour. Usually, it is regarded as bad practice to give your opponent the benefit of suggesting that he might win. They are going to make an exception in your case in order to scare the country to the polls to vote Labour. The consolation, at least for your prospects of remaining as Tory leader, is that the rest of the Shadow Cabinet is even more wildly unpopular. The public have no idea who most of this collection of nonentities are, and are allergic to those of them that they can put a handle on. Ann Widdecombe has her followers, but I know you work on the assumption that even the Conservative Party isn't barking enough to make her leader. The excellent news from your point of view is that Michael Portillo seems to have lost the plot, disappeared with virtually no trace, leaving behind just a faint whiff of hair oil. I always understood it to be your strategy not to think of trying to win the next election and concentrate on just doing well to survive as Leader of the Opposition to fight the election after. That is why you put in place all those complicated changes to leadership contests to make a post-election challenge much harder. In that sense, in the sense that your strategy is predicated on being a loser, everything is still going to plan.",

      "bodyText": "A week at the Philadelphia revels yields only two terse conclusions. That the Republicans, out of office and out of sorts, truly believe their presidential time has come again. And that the new messiah, George Walker Bush, is free to fudge and mudge to his heart's content - as long as he delivers. The rest is hoop-la. After New Labour, then, there is the New GOP. After Tony Blair, there is George Dubya. The difficulty - especially for those Tory spies, William Hague and Michael Portillo, left behind on their flying visit - is that the Blair camp picked up most of its 'new' ideas from Bill Clinton in the first place. Governor Bush is not a commanding orator, either live or (more important) on television. He reads too mechanically from the autocue; his eyes, close up, are slits behind lowering brows which seem to bear down on the rest of his face, squeezing the jaw below so that his lips distort into a hapless smirk. But he has talent, and talented writers. His big night was a night when surviving was all that was necessary - and he was better than that. His interminable citing of poor black kids and trusting teachers broke through by sheer repetition. (Teaching in America is the current substitute for military service in this time of peace: Saving Mr Chips, not Private Ryan). He held his line on abortion and guns up front without apology, then drowned them in 'human' tales of people he'd met who inspire him. He talked integrity until his smirk ached.

      "body": "<p>In the middle of the panic last week that resulted from the News of the World 's 'name and shame' campaign, two court cases involving allegations of extreme violence and sexual abuse were pushed to the inside pages of the local newspapers.</p> <p>At York Crown Court on Thursday, Cynthia Chandler, 70, was found guilty of an appalling series of violent crimes against boys in the Harrogate children's home she ran with her husband, Reginald, in the 1960s. She was given a nine-month prison sentence. A shocked courtroom heard how she had slammed a stiletto-heeled shoe into a 10-year-old's head, beaten a 16-year-old with a broom until his body was covered in bruises and hit a 14-year-old over the back of his head with a metal shovel because he was too slow doing the washing up. The catalogue of sadism culminated in the story of how she had punished an 11-year-old boy by locking him naked in a small room where she beat him and dragged him around by his hair.</p> <p>Reginald Chandler is now in prison too, serving eight years for creating what was described to the same court last year as a 'culture of homosexual acts' at Fairfield National Children's Home, where he had sexually abused boys aged between nine and 17 for more than a decade. After Cynthia Chandler's conviction for assault and unlawful wounding last week North Yorkshire police closed Operation Pudsey, an inquiry into 33 years of sexual physical abuse in children's homes in Ripon and Harrogate. It had lasted nearly three years and put six people behind bars.</p> <p>The second case could have even more serious implications. As Chandler was being sent to prison, Thomas 'Harry' Williams was being acquitted at Liverpool Crown Court of 20 charges of offences against boys at a home in Formby on Merseyside. Williams's supporters said the police in Operation Care were now 'out of control'. An organisation called Fact (Falsely Accused Carers and Teachers) has sprung up to represent the accused, some of whom have been 'named and shamed' in local leafleting campaigns.</p> <p>Investigations into children's homes have proliferated over the past decade, during which time Britain has become obsessed with the paedophile threat. At the last count there were more than 80 separate children's home investigations in 32 different police forces.</p> <p>If half the allegations are true, then lawyers representing the victims are right to talk in terms of a national disaster. If not, we are facing the most serious miscarriages of justice since the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.</p> <p>'As a nation we have to wake up to the fact that child abuse is far more prevalent than any of us realised,' said Lee Moore, of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, which co-ordinates the work of solicitors on the various inquiries. 'These investigations are destroying all assumptions we had about our society.'</p> <p>But Chris Saltrese, a lawyer who has represented many of the alleged abusers on Merseyside, argues that there are deep flaws in the police methodology, which involves contacting every person who has ever been at the homes involved. He believes that many of the people who come forward are simply hoping to make money from compensation claims. Saltrese said: 'What's going on is that entirely innocent people are being locked up on a daily basis. We are witnessing a crisis in the British legal system, which will make it increasingly difficult to identify abuse in the future. Abuse did go on, but the scale has been hugely exaggerated.'</p> <p>As one inquiry closes, another opens up. Last month, Lancashire police announced Operation Nevada, which will investigate 30 years of alleged abuse in seven children's homes. They already have 11 people they wish to question.</p> <p>The seven detectives working full time on Nevada will liaise with Merseyside (Operation Care - 80 homes), Greater Manchester (Operation Cleopatra - 66 homes) and Cheshire, where a permanent paedophile investigation unit has been set up.</p> <p>Meanwhile, police have just made their first arrest in Operation React, an investigation into homes in Bristol and Somerset. And in Devon and Cornwall, Operation Lentish is investigating about 2,000 alleged instances of abuse in 107 homes.</p> <p>Before any newspaper campaign, it was investigations into abuse in children's homes that first raised the issue of the disclosure of the names of paedophiles. Last February, in his report into abuse in children's homes in North Wales, Sir Ronald Waterhouse took the controversial step of naming the individuals convicted of paedophile offences, some of whom had served their sentence and were back in the community.</p> <p>The crimes were deemed so serious that the public had a right to know who these men were, although newspapers were urged not to track them down or print their photographs. 'The Waterhouse report changed the way everyone thought about disclosure of the names to the community,' said George Barrow of the Association of Chief Probation Officers. 'Any movement towards some sort of \"Sarah's Law\" will continue a debate over notification that began with North Wales.'</p> <p>The week began with warnings from children's organisations, probation officers and the police that the News of the World was driving paedophiles underground. By Friday, it was clear that the newspaper would be forced to end its campaign as vigilante attacks on innocent individuals mistaken for paedophiles, as well as people named and pictured by the newspaper, were becoming a serious threat to public order.</p> <p>Billhar Uppal, a solicitor who represented many of the victims in North Wales, said the events of the past two weeks had been disastrous for those working with people abused by paedophiles: 'People have been whipped up into a frenzy and completely lost perspective. This hysteria does the victims no good whatsoever.'</p> <p>On Merseyside, attention will now turn to Operation Care and the trial in November of David Jones, the former manager of Southampton football club, who is accused of abusing children at a home where he worked in the late 1980s. The home cannot be named because of a contempt order imposed by the court, but the scale of the allegations is staggering. Between 1960 and 1992, an estimated 125 victims have made allegations against around 50 abusers.</p> <p>Peter Garsden, a solicitor working for the victims on Merseyside, said it was impossible to underestimate the scale of the problem: 'Everyone who gets involved is deeply affected by it, not just the victims. This has nearly taken me to the grave and back.'</p> <p>Detective Sergeant Graham Thomas of Operation Care agreed: 'The very scale of this came as a surprise to most people working in the area of child protection.'</p> <p><b>The falsely accused: Phil Fowler, 45</b></p> <p><b>In January 1995, Fowler (not his real name) was charged with statutory rape of a girl, 14. He was later charged with offences against two boys. After working with children and young offenders in the North West for 15 years, he was suspended and has not worked in the field since. Three years ago, he was cleared of all charges. He is involved in an organisation for people falsely accused of child abuse. </b></p> <p>'When the police first arrived in late 1994, they were evasive. It was only later that they told me the allegations came from 1979. I knew the girl involved didn't come into the system until 1980, so their evidence was flawed. The same thing happened with one of the other allegations. I was accused of buggery and indecent assault from 1982 and 1983 by a boy who hadn't come into care until 1984. At the time an officer told me the investigation was going nowhere, but they carried on just the same. I was completely isolated. There were none of the organisations that exist now to fight these accusations. I was cut off from work colleagues. It seemed as if there was no way through for me. If I could have proved that black was white, I wouldn't have won. The men who made the allegations had long criminal records, but they have been involved in the convictions of other people. There is no doubt kids have been abused - people have pleaded guilty - but not on this scale.'</p> <p><b>The victim: Brian Gavin, 33</b></p> <p><b>St Vincent's, a children's home and residential school for boys in Formby, Merseyside, was one of the first homes to be investigated by the police in the North-West. In 1995, Edward Stanton, who worked at the home in the 1970s, was given 13 years for serious sexual offences against boys. Brian Gavin was nine when he first went to St Vincent's.</b></p> <p>'Dad was a heavy drinker, who beat my mum up. She just got fed up with it and left my dad with five boys. One day he left a note saying that we were being sent on holiday for two weeks. It was a holiday that lasted 10 years. St Vincent's was a big spooky building with a long drive that used to be a nunnery. It started a couple of weeks after I arrived. Stanton was short and fat, with little round glasses. I'll never forget him. I was in his dormitory and he would get drunk and come around at night and abuse me. Although he never penetrated me, it was everything else. I reported him to the headmaster once and it stopped for a month or so, but he would always find a way to get me on my own.</p> <p>'It was physical stuff too. I once got in a fight with another boy playing pool, so he got me in the school boxing ring, made me put on the gloves and beat the hell out of me. That was his way of teaching me a lesson.</p> <p>'By 1994, when the police came to see me, I was beginning to get over it, but it just brought it all back. I wish I could just get on with my life, but I've been diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and over the years I've smoked pot, sniffed glue and been inside.</p> <p>'To me, 13 years is not enough. My life is upside down.'</p>",

He believes that many of the people who come forward are simply hoping to make money from compensation claims. Saltrese said: 'What's going on is that entirely innocent people are being locked up on a daily basis. We are witnessing a crisis in the British legal system, which will make it increasingly difficult to identify abuse in the future. Abuse did go on, but the scale has been hugely exaggerated.' As one inquiry closes, another opens up. Last month, Lancashire police announced Operation Nevada, which will investigate 30 years of alleged abuse in seven children's homes. They already have 11 people they wish to question. The seven detectives working full time on Nevada will liaise with Merseyside (Operation Care - 80 homes), Greater Manchester (Operation Cleopatra - 66 homes) and Cheshire, where a permanent paedophile investigation unit has been set up. Meanwhile, police have just made their first arrest in Operation React, an investigation into homes in Bristol and Somerset. And in Devon and Cornwall, Operation Lentish is investigating about 2,000 alleged instances of abuse in 107 homes. Before any newspaper campaign, it was investigations into abuse in children's homes that first raised the issue of the disclosure of the names of paedophiles. Last February, in his report into abuse in children's homes in North Wales, Sir Ronald Waterhouse took the controversial step of naming the individuals convicted of paedophile offences, some of whom had served their sentence and were back in the community. The crimes were deemed so serious that the public had a right to know who these men were, although newspapers were urged not to track them down or print their photographs. 'The Waterhouse report changed the way everyone thought about disclosure of the names to the community,' said George Barrow of the Association of Chief Probation Officers. 'Any movement towards some sort of \"Sarah's Law\" will continue a debate over notification that began with North Wales.' The week began with warnings from children's organisations, probation officers and the police that the News of the World was driving paedophiles underground. By Friday, it was clear that the newspaper would be forced to end its campaign as vigilante attacks on innocent individuals mistaken for paedophiles, as well as people named and pictured by the newspaper, were becoming a serious threat to public order. Billhar Uppal, a solicitor who represented many of the victims in North Wales, said the events of the past two weeks had been disastrous for those working with people abused by paedophiles: 'People have been whipped up into a frenzy and completely lost perspective. This hysteria does the victims no good whatsoever.' On Merseyside, attention will now turn to Operation Care and the trial in November of David Jones, the former manager of Southampton football club, who is accused of abusing children at a home where he worked in the late 1980s. The home cannot be named because of a contempt order imposed by the court, but the scale of the allegations is staggering. Between 1960 and 1992, an estimated 125 victims have made allegations against around 50 abusers. Peter Garsden, a solicitor working for the victims on Merseyside, said it was impossible to underestimate the scale of the problem: 'Everyone who gets involved is deeply affected by it, not just the victims. This has nearly taken me to the grave and back.' Detective Sergeant Graham Thomas of Operation Care agreed: 'The very scale of this came as a surprise to most people working in the area of child protection.' The falsely accused: Phil Fowler, 45 In January 1995, Fowler (not his real name) was charged with statutory rape of a girl, 14. He was later charged with offences against two boys. After working with children and young offenders in the North West for 15 years, he was suspended and has not worked in the field since. Three years ago, he was cleared of all charges. He is involved in an organisation for people falsely accused of child abuse. 'When the police first arrived in late 1994, they were evasive. It was only later that they told me the allegations came from 1979. I knew the girl involved didn't come into the system until 1980, so their evidence was flawed. The same thing happened with one of the other allegations. I was accused of buggery and indecent assault from 1982 and 1983 by a boy who hadn't come into care until 1984. At the time an officer told me the investigation was going nowhere, but they carried on just the same. I was completely isolated. There were none of the organisations that exist now to fight these accusations. I was cut off from work colleagues. It seemed as if there was no way through for me. If I could have proved that black was white, I wouldn't have won. The men who made the allegations had long criminal records, but they have been involved in the convictions of other people. There is no doubt kids have been abused - people have pleaded guilty - but not on this scale.' The victim: Brian Gavin, 33 St Vincent's, a children's home and residential school for boys in Formby, Merseyside, was one of the first homes to be investigated by the police in the North-West. In 1995, Edward Stanton, who worked at the home in the 1970s, was given 13 years for serious sexual offences against boys. Brian Gavin was nine when he first went to St Vincent's. 'Dad was a heavy drinker, who beat my mum up. She just got fed up with it and left my dad with five boys. One day he left a note saying that we were being sent on holiday for two weeks. It was a holiday that lasted 10 years. St Vincent's was a big spooky building with a long drive that used to be a nunnery. It started a couple of weeks after I arrived. Stanton was short and fat, with little round glasses. I'll never forget him. I was in his dormitory and he would get drunk and come around at night and abuse me. Although he never penetrated me, it was everything else. I reported him to the headmaster once and it stopped for a month or so, but he would always find a way to get me on my own. 'It was physical stuff too. I once got in a fight with another boy playing pool, so he got me in the school boxing ring, made me put on the gloves and beat the hell out of me. That was his way of teaching me a lesson. 'By 1994, when the police came to see me, I was beginning to get over it, but it just brought it all back. I wish I could just get on with my life, but I've been diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and over the years I've smoked pot, sniffed glue and been inside. 'To me, 13 years is not enough. My life is upside down.'",

The media coverage has been sycophantic, inane and repetitive. Once again some are claiming that these outdated ceremonies strengthen the case for scrapping the royal family and installing a president as head of state. It seems like a strong case.</p> <p>However, this argument has focused more on a distaste for the present incumbents than the institution itself. They confuse the personal with the political, citing the numerous occasions when members of the House of Windsor have undermined the monarchy: Edward VIII's flirtation with Hitler; the Queen Mother's subsequent black-balling of Wallis Simpson; Prince Philip's frequent ill-judged remarks; the Queen's reluctance to lead the mourning following the death of Princess Diana.</p> <p>These errors of judgment have provided more than enough ammunition for republicans who focus on theoretical constitutional considerations. Yet they ignore more practical issues, such as how the transition to a republic would take place. History shows that few modern social democracies have ever taken such a risk.</p> <p>Even if a British referendum supported change there is no guarantee that the electorate would buck recent trends and show more interest in a presidential election. Would we be happy with a president elected by 10 or 15 per cent of the population? Even a vote by the legislature to select a head of state brings many risks. Just ask Shimon Peres. Last week he failed to become president of Israel, not because he wasn't popular but because opposition parties wanted to rock the government's boat without destabilising the Middle East peace process.</p> <p>And do we really want another quasi-politician dominating the landscape? Surely it makes sense to preserve a part of our public life for individuals who reside above politics. This is the principle behind an impartial Civil Service, a servant of the Crown, and is still valid when considering the case for a constitutional monarchy.</p> <p>Just as Whitehall brings governments of different hues a vast range of experience so does a monarch. Tony Blair benefited during the Kosovo crisis from having a counsel who has the inside story on Suez and the Falklands. No one other than the monarch has the capacity to gain this knowledge and maintain the discretion necessary to give completely private advice to a serving Prime Minister.</p> <p>When the Prime Minister is not receiving advice from the Queen he often turns to focus groups and polls. The most recent surveys show overwhelming support for preserving the current system. Though there are republicans in Mr Blair's Cabinet they have few allies outside the metropolitan \u00e9lite. During my time working for the Government I only ever heard praise for Her Majesty from those around the Premier. This Government does not have a reputation for flying in the face of public opinion and it should not start now.</p> <p>Despite these justifications, The Observer 's campaign shows that the case for a republic is growing. Which is why some reforms should take place. The House of Windsor can easily restore its reputation by taking on its opponents. The Royal Prerogative needs to be drastically reduced and the powers distributed to more appropriate bodies. Prime Ministers should be appointed by the Speaker of the Commons not the monarch. Primogeniture should be scrapped. The number of official members of the family should be reduced. Over-the-top celebrations should be scaled down, with the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002 being the first opportunity. The royal palaces and their works of art should be more accessible to the public. Sensible steps which would remove so much of the stigma and hostility associated with the royal family and increase the legitimacy of the system which they represent.</p> <p>There is a case, based on strict democratic principals for scrapping the monarchy. Similarly, there are sensible, pragmatic and admittedly somewhat emotional reasons for keeping it. For those of us who see the advantages in the present system it is time we started to say so.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have not enjoyed the Queen Mother's numerous birthday celebrations. They have been extravagant, unnecessary and clich\u00e9d. The media coverage has been sycophantic, inane and repetitive. Once again some are claiming that these outdated ceremonies strengthen the case for scrapping the royal family and installing a president as head of state. It seems like a strong case. However, this argument has focused more on a distaste for the present incumbents than the institution itself. They confuse the personal with the political, citing the numerous occasions when members of the House of Windsor have undermined the monarchy: Edward VIII's flirtation with Hitler; the Queen Mother's subsequent black-balling of Wallis Simpson; Prince Philip's frequent ill-judged remarks; the Queen's reluctance to lead the mourning following the death of Princess Diana. These errors of judgment have provided more than enough ammunition for republicans who focus on theoretical constitutional considerations. Yet they ignore more practical issues, such as how the transition to a republic would take place. History shows that few modern social democracies have ever taken such a risk. Even if a British referendum supported change there is no guarantee that the electorate would buck recent trends and show more interest in a presidential election. Would we be happy with a president elected by 10 or 15 per cent of the population? Even a vote by the legislature to select a head of state brings many risks. Just ask Shimon Peres. Last week he failed to become president of Israel, not because he wasn't popular but because opposition parties wanted to rock the government's boat without destabilising the Middle East peace process. And do we really want another quasi-politician dominating the landscape? Surely it makes sense to preserve a part of our public life for individuals who reside above politics. This is the principle behind an impartial Civil Service, a servant of the Crown, and is still valid when considering the case for a constitutional monarchy. Just as Whitehall brings governments of different hues a vast range of experience so does a monarch. Tony Blair benefited during the Kosovo crisis from having a counsel who has the inside story on Suez and the Falklands. No one other than the monarch has the capacity to gain this knowledge and maintain the discretion necessary to give completely private advice to a serving Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister is not receiving advice from the Queen he often turns to focus groups and polls. The most recent surveys show overwhelming support for preserving the current system. Though there are republicans in Mr Blair's Cabinet they have few allies outside the metropolitan \u00e9lite. During my time working for the Government I only ever heard praise for Her Majesty from those around the Premier. This Government does not have a reputation for flying in the face of public opinion and it should not start now. Despite these justifications, The Observer 's campaign shows that the case for a republic is growing. Which is why some reforms should take place. The House of Windsor can easily restore its reputation by taking on its opponents. The Royal Prerogative needs to be drastically reduced and the powers distributed to more appropriate bodies. Prime Ministers should be appointed by the Speaker of the Commons not the monarch. Primogeniture should be scrapped. The number of official members of the family should be reduced. Over-the-top celebrations should be scaled down, with the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002 being the first opportunity. The royal palaces and their works of art should be more accessible to the public. Sensible steps which would remove so much of the stigma and hostility associated with the royal family and increase the legitimacy of the system which they represent. There is a case, based on strict democratic principals for scrapping the monarchy. Similarly, there are sensible, pragmatic and admittedly somewhat emotional reasons for keeping it. For those of us who see the advantages in the present system it is time we started to say so.",

      "body": "<p>It was 2.30pm when, with the curtains drawn against the prying lenses of the media pack outside, Gordon Brown called for quiet. He and his bride, Sarah Jane Macaulay, would now cut the cake and then there would be a few words from the groom and the best man, John, his brother.</p> <p>The 25 guests at Brown's house outside North Queensferry, Fife, knew they were coming to the end of one of the most remarkable days of the political year. Brown began his speech with the classic groom's opening. 'On behalf of my wife and I, I'd like to thank you all for coming.' He got a warm murmur of appreciative laughter.</p> <p>Some time ago, Brown continued, the couple agreed in principle that they would get married - but they had to meet the convergence criteria and pass the five tests before they were able to do so. Laughter again filled the room.</p> <p>He was now happy to report that the five tests had been met. It was certainly in their best interests to get married. It was a sustainable relationship with no risk, and they were now definitely able to get the public's support. All the forecasts were good and the Iron Chancellor gave his whole-hearted backing to the union.</p> <p>It was Brown at his best. Surrounded by family and friends, the people he trusts, he was warm and witty. Gone was the desiccated economist, the man for whom only Prudence held any allure.</p> <p>'It will certainly be a very memorable day for all of us,' John Brown said. 'Despite the invasion of the media, it was a relaxing day. That's what Gordon and Sarah wanted it to be.'</p> <p>This is more than a story about two people getting married. It is a story about secrecy, about the delight of a Chancellor who managed to organise his big day unnoticed by the world until 24 hours before kick-off. That reveals much about the type of man Brown is - he didn't even tell the Prime Minister the news.</p> <p>In its broadest sense, this is also a story about politics. It is about the journey of Sarah Macaulay into one of the most exclusive clubs in the country, the handful of powerful women who are a heartbeat from the centre of power: Cherie Blair, the Prime Minister's wife and leading barrister; Sue Nye, personal assistant to Brown and partner of Gavyn Davies, multi-millionaire director of Goldman-Sachs and Brown adviser; Yvette Cooper, Health Minister and partner of Ed Balls, Brown's closest aide; Anji Hunter, Tony Blair's private assistant.</p> <p>And now Sarah Macaulay joins the club as wife of the Chancellor and joint head of one of Britain's most influential PR companies, Hobsbawm Macaulay.</p> <p>This marriage - the kisses on the lawn, the \u00a311.99 champagne from Sainsbury's - says much about the status of Brown and his path to the job that so many believe he should have. Prime Minister Brown has more of a realistic ring to it this weekend than it did four days ago.</p> <p>The first inklings of last Thursday's event came at Easter. That's when Brown usually starts arranging his annual summer holiday to Cape Cod. But this year was a bit different. Brown did not appear quite so keen for his brother to accompany him. John wondered if something was afoot, but he didn't ask - the Browns are not that kind of family. 'Scots are reserved, even if they are brothers.' John said. Although Gordon and Sarah had got engaged in January, the Chancellor had not even told his closest relatives of his plans.</p> <p>Things went quiet. Sarah and Brown travelled to America for the wedding of Sarah's brother, Sean, in April. There was another little message there, but no one picked it up.</p> <p>Two weeks ago John was on his way to dinner in Strathblane, a small town to the north of Glasgow. His mobile phone rang. It was his brother. 'I've got good news,' Brown said.</p> <p>'I was taken by surprise,' John said. 'He asked me to be his best man. I was delighted.' In previous summers the media had speculated about an August wedding. But a couple of diary stories suggested that the relationship had floundered. Macaulay had been seen 'red-eyed' at a party hosted by Nick Brown, the Agriculture Secretary and friend of the Chancellor. The media had put two and two together and come up with 11.</p> <p>Brown started telling his family about the wedding just after he announced the Comprehensive Spending Review. Love may have been in his heart, but the Chancellor wanted to get the politics out of the way first.</p> <p>'We were all expecting the news to break, if not within hours then within three or four days,' John said. 'Gordon was prepared for it. And so was Sarah. Every day [it didn't come out] was a bonus. As it worked out it was perfect, there was no spinning, no fixing.'</p> <p>For Brown's friends, the contrast with Blair's media operation could not be more stark.</p> <p>The wedding might have remained a secret if David Thompson, while on holiday in France, had not taken a call from an old political contact. The Daily Record Westminster reporter was told it might be worth checking the banns pinned up in the registry office in Inverkeithing near the North Queensferry home of one Gordon Brown.</p> <p>There were rumours around that the Chancellor was getting married. It was midday last Wednesday - less than 24 hours before the ceremony began.</p> <p>Thompson rang his news desk in Glasgow. They told the editor, Martin Clarke. The chase was on. Gethin Chamberlain, a reporter based in Edinburgh, was told to get to Inverkeithing and see what was going on. Chamberlain drove the 10 miles north, across the Forth Road bridge, to the small town that was suddenly going to become very important. He checked the yellowing list of official announcements pinned up in the window of the registrar's office. It had been sitting there for two weeks, unnoticed. There were the names - James Gordon Brown and Sarah Jane Macaulay. Chamberlain called into the office.</p> <p>Clarke had a dilemma. Did he run the story, all five pages the Record had laid out for the next day's edition, without checking with the Chancellor's office? Although sure of the story, he decided he couldn't risk it. What if it was some kind of elaborate hoax?</p> <p>As the evening deadline approached, he rang Brown's home number but found the fax machine was turned on, blocking the call. He rang John on his mobile, but the answer machine was all he got. He called Douglas Alexander, the Paisley MP and friend of Brown, who refused to say anything. He sent Brown a fax. Still no response.</p> <p>In the end Clarke paged Ian Austin, Brown's special adviser. Austin was having dinner in Edinburgh with Brown and Sarah and members of the Brown and Macaulay family. It was the pre-wedding dinner hosted by Sarah's mother and step-father, Pauline Macaulay and Patrick Vaughan.</p> <p>Now they knew the Record had found out. Austin calmly left the table, phoned a short statement to the Press Association and rang Clarke. The rabbit had finally escaped from the hat and the press pack started making their way to the Chancellor's house in North Queensferry.</p> <p>On the day John Smith died in 1994, many people thought Brown would be the next leader of the party and, if he played his political cards right, the next Prime Minister. But Brown had a problem: no family and no prospect of one - not problems that afflicted Tony Blair. 'He could never be Prime Minister if he wasn't married,' said a close friend of the Chancellor over the weekend. 'I know it is an awfully cynical thing to say but it is the truth. In his first speech after John Smith died, Tony Blair talked about family values. That is the reality.'</p> <p>Now the dynamic has changed for Brown. Modern politics is about being able to link your own private concerns (your children, your family home) with those of the nation. In major political speeches Blair often refers to how much he worries about his children. Many in the Brown camp wince at such tactics but realise they play well.</p> <p>The way the wedding was handled has helped Brown's image. Many voters believe that spin and media manipulation are the damaging threads that run through this Government. Brown has revealed the clear blue water between his approach to the media - in this case at least - and many other arms of the Government. If he had completely had his own way, the Chancellor would have invited a Press Association photographer to the wedding, allowed one photograph and then made a short announcement.</p> <p>Macaulay has also made it clear she will never become a public media figure. She has never given an interview and is unlikely ever to do so. Friends insist she will not be seen smiling demurely through a myriad of public engagements with the Chancellor.</p> <p>But her presence nails the vicious rumours that have circled around Brown - rumours that reveal something rotten in parts of the Labour movement. Take one example. Before the 1997 election Brown's aides took informal soundings among trade union leaders about their support for the future Chancellor. A quarter said they wouldn't back him as leader because they thought he was gay. One trade union leader commented: 'The thing is, everyone thinks he's a fucking woofter.' Such homophobic sentiment runs deep in parts of the Labour Party.</p> <p>Macaulay's presence also publicly softens the long-held view that Brown is too politically obsessed to have any interests outside Westminster, a perception that plays badly with the public.</p> <p>The drive and ambition won't go, of course. Brown was a man brought up with it. When they were young, he and his brothers grew up among the Govan shipyards, where life for working men and women was tough. They had it instilled in them by their father that a more equal society was worth striving for. Brown has never truly lost his socialist roots and, in an age of ideological fuzz, backbenchers appreciate that.</p> <p>At his rented holiday home on Cape Cod this weekend, Brown can finally relax, settled at least with the idea that no one will be asking him about the marriage any more. Now the questions will be about when they are going to have children.</p> <p>But the political Brown will never be far from the surface. He may be seeking out the American bars where he can watch British football, as he does every year, but his Treasury heart is always beating. Before he left for the honeymoon he took time out to ensure that Friday's announcement on credit cards and financial services rip-offs was handled correctly.</p> <p>Mr and Mrs Brown discussed visiting the Democrat conference in Los Angeles while they were in America, but distance seems to have knocked that idea on the head. There aren't many honeymooning couples whose idea of a good time would include a date listening to Al Gore.</p> <p>And then there's the tennis. Both play while in Cape Cod, and both play to win. 'I try and have a bash, but Gordon is very, very competitive,' John said. 'I'm less bothered, I suppose, but my son is competitive and sometimes he's quite good. Gordon hates getting beaten.'</p> <p>He laughs, the brother who admits that the groom's speech at the wedding was far funnier than the best man's.</p> <p>Additional reporting, Stuart Millar</p> <p><b>Labour's women of influence</b></p> <p><b> Cherie Blair</b></p> <p><b> Position:</b><br> Leading barrister, wife of the Prime Minister <b> Age:</b><br> 46 <b> Known for:</b><br> Taking on the Government in employment cases; forgetting to get out of her night shirt when she accepted flowers at the doors of Number 10. <b> Power rating:</b><br> 9</p> <p><b> Anji Hunter</b></p> <p><b> Position:</b><br> Blair's 'special assistant for presentation and planning'.

      "bodyText": "It was 2.30pm when, with the curtains drawn against the prying lenses of the media pack outside, Gordon Brown called for quiet. He and his bride, Sarah Jane Macaulay, would now cut the cake and then there would be a few words from the groom and the best man, John, his brother. The 25 guests at Brown's house outside North Queensferry, Fife, knew they were coming to the end of one of the most remarkable days of the political year. Brown began his speech with the classic groom's opening. 'On behalf of my wife and I, I'd like to thank you all for coming.' He got a warm murmur of appreciative laughter. Some time ago, Brown continued, the couple agreed in principle that they would get married - but they had to meet the convergence criteria and pass the five tests before they were able to do so. Laughter again filled the room. He was now happy to report that the five tests had been met. It was certainly in their best interests to get married. It was a sustainable relationship with no risk, and they were now definitely able to get the public's support. All the forecasts were good and the Iron Chancellor gave his whole-hearted backing to the union. It was Brown at his best. Surrounded by family and friends, the people he trusts, he was warm and witty. Gone was the desiccated economist, the man for whom only Prudence held any allure. 'It will certainly be a very memorable day for all of us,' John Brown said. 'Despite the invasion of the media, it was a relaxing day. That's what Gordon and Sarah wanted it to be.' This is more than a story about two people getting married. It is a story about secrecy, about the delight of a Chancellor who managed to organise his big day unnoticed by the world until 24 hours before kick-off. That reveals much about the type of man Brown is - he didn't even tell the Prime Minister the news. In its broadest sense, this is also a story about politics. It is about the journey of Sarah Macaulay into one of the most exclusive clubs in the country, the handful of powerful women who are a heartbeat from the centre of power: Cherie Blair, the Prime Minister's wife and leading barrister; Sue Nye, personal assistant to Brown and partner of Gavyn Davies, multi-millionaire director of Goldman-Sachs and Brown adviser; Yvette Cooper, Health Minister and partner of Ed Balls, Brown's closest aide; Anji Hunter, Tony Blair's private assistant. And now Sarah Macaulay joins the club as wife of the Chancellor and joint head of one of Britain's most influential PR companies, Hobsbawm Macaulay. This marriage - the kisses on the lawn, the \u00a311.99 champagne from Sainsbury's - says much about the status of Brown and his path to the job that so many believe he should have. Prime Minister Brown has more of a realistic ring to it this weekend than it did four days ago. The first inklings of last Thursday's event came at Easter. That's when Brown usually starts arranging his annual summer holiday to Cape Cod. But this year was a bit different. Brown did not appear quite so keen for his brother to accompany him. John wondered if something was afoot, but he didn't ask - the Browns are not that kind of family. 'Scots are reserved, even if they are brothers.' John said. Although Gordon and Sarah had got engaged in January, the Chancellor had not even told his closest relatives of his plans. Things went quiet. Sarah and Brown travelled to America for the wedding of Sarah's brother, Sean, in April. There was another little message there, but no one picked it up. Two weeks ago John was on his way to dinner in Strathblane, a small town to the north of Glasgow. His mobile phone rang. It was his brother. 'I've got good news,' Brown said. 'I was taken by surprise,' John said. 'He asked me to be his best man. I was delighted.' In previous summers the media had speculated about an August wedding. But a couple of diary stories suggested that the relationship had floundered. Macaulay had been seen 'red-eyed' at a party hosted by Nick Brown, the Agriculture Secretary and friend of the Chancellor. The media had put two and two together and come up with 11. Brown started telling his family about the wedding just after he announced the Comprehensive Spending Review. Love may have been in his heart, but the Chancellor wanted to get the politics out of the way first. 'We were all expecting the news to break, if not within hours then within three or four days,' John said. 'Gordon was prepared for it. And so was Sarah. Every day [it didn't come out] was a bonus. As it worked out it was perfect, there was no spinning, no fixing.' For Brown's friends, the contrast with Blair's media operation could not be more stark. The wedding might have remained a secret if David Thompson, while on holiday in France, had not taken a call from an old political contact. The Daily Record Westminster reporter was told it might be worth checking the banns pinned up in the registry office in Inverkeithing near the North Queensferry home of one Gordon Brown. There were rumours around that the Chancellor was getting married. It was midday last Wednesday - less than 24 hours before the ceremony began. Thompson rang his news desk in Glasgow. They told the editor, Martin Clarke. The chase was on. Gethin Chamberlain, a reporter based in Edinburgh, was told to get to Inverkeithing and see what was going on. Chamberlain drove the 10 miles north, across the Forth Road bridge, to the small town that was suddenly going to become very important. He checked the yellowing list of official announcements pinned up in the window of the registrar's office. It had been sitting there for two weeks, unnoticed. There were the names - James Gordon Brown and Sarah Jane Macaulay. Chamberlain called into the office. Clarke had a dilemma. Did he run the story, all five pages the Record had laid out for the next day's edition, without checking with the Chancellor's office? Although sure of the story, he decided he couldn't risk it. What if it was some kind of elaborate hoax? As the evening deadline approached, he rang Brown's home number but found the fax machine was turned on, blocking the call. He rang John on his mobile, but the answer machine was all he got. He called Douglas Alexander, the Paisley MP and friend of Brown, who refused to say anything. He sent Brown a fax. Still no response. In the end Clarke paged Ian Austin, Brown's special adviser. Austin was having dinner in Edinburgh with Brown and Sarah and members of the Brown and Macaulay family. It was the pre-wedding dinner hosted by Sarah's mother and step-father, Pauline Macaulay and Patrick Vaughan. Now they knew the Record had found out. Austin calmly left the table, phoned a short statement to the Press Association and rang Clarke. The rabbit had finally escaped from the hat and the press pack started making their way to the Chancellor's house in North Queensferry. On the day John Smith died in 1994, many people thought Brown would be the next leader of the party and, if he played his political cards right, the next Prime Minister. But Brown had a problem: no family and no prospect of one - not problems that afflicted Tony Blair. 'He could never be Prime Minister if he wasn't married,' said a close friend of the Chancellor over the weekend. 'I know it is an awfully cynical thing to say but it is the truth. In his first speech after John Smith died, Tony Blair talked about family values. That is the reality.' Now the dynamic has changed for Brown. Modern politics is about being able to link your own private concerns (your children, your family home) with those of the nation. In major political speeches Blair often refers to how much he worries about his children. Many in the Brown camp wince at such tactics but realise they play well. The way the wedding was handled has helped Brown's image. Many voters believe that spin and media manipulation are the damaging threads that run through this Government. Brown has revealed the clear blue water between his approach to the media - in this case at least - and many other arms of the Government. If he had completely had his own way, the Chancellor would have invited a Press Association photographer to the wedding, allowed one photograph and then made a short announcement. Macaulay has also made it clear she will never become a public media figure. She has never given an interview and is unlikely ever to do so. Friends insist she will not be seen smiling demurely through a myriad of public engagements with the Chancellor. But her presence nails the vicious rumours that have circled around Brown - rumours that reveal something rotten in parts of the Labour movement. Take one example. Before the 1997 election Brown's aides took informal soundings among trade union leaders about their support for the future Chancellor. A quarter said they wouldn't back him as leader because they thought he was gay. One trade union leader commented: 'The thing is, everyone thinks he's a fucking woofter.' Such homophobic sentiment runs deep in parts of the Labour Party. Macaulay's presence also publicly softens the long-held view that Brown is too politically obsessed to have any interests outside Westminster, a perception that plays badly with the public. The drive and ambition won't go, of course. Brown was a man brought up with it. When they were young, he and his brothers grew up among the Govan shipyards, where life for working men and women was tough. They had it instilled in them by their father that a more equal society was worth striving for. Brown has never truly lost his socialist roots and, in an age of ideological fuzz, backbenchers appreciate that. At his rented holiday home on Cape Cod this weekend, Brown can finally relax, settled at least with the idea that no one will be asking him about the marriage any more. Now the questions will be about when they are going to have children. But the political Brown will never be far from the surface. He may be seeking out the American bars where he can watch British football, as he does every year, but his Treasury heart is always beating. Before he left for the honeymoon he took time out to ensure that Friday's announcement on credit cards and financial services rip-offs was handled correctly. Mr and Mrs Brown discussed visiting the Democrat conference in Los Angeles while they were in America, but distance seems to have knocked that idea on the head. There aren't many honeymooning couples whose idea of a good time would include a date listening to Al Gore. And then there's the tennis. Both play while in Cape Cod, and both play to win. 'I try and have a bash, but Gordon is very, very competitive,' John said. 'I'm less bothered, I suppose, but my son is competitive and sometimes he's quite good. Gordon hates getting beaten.' He laughs, the brother who admits that the groom's speech at the wedding was far funnier than the best man's.

The BBC even rang to check if it was Massow as in 'cow' or Massow as in 'low' (it's the second, not that I really care). But what it really is is Massow as in happy. I'm relieved I did the right thing.",

      "bodyText": "Cherie Blair, the Prime Minister's wife, is to make an appearance at the Labour Party conference, chairing a debate on accusations that the Government has failed women. In the highly political move, she has agreed to appear at the event organised by the Institute for Public Policy Research. Her decision reveals the importance she attaches to the issue and will ensure that the debate - 'A Marriage of Convenience, Has New Labour delivered for Women?' - leads the political agenda. But critics have pointed out that, as the Prime Minister's wife, she has to be careful not to take on an overtly political role, something she has been careful to avoid in the past. The move could bring comparisons with Hillary Clinton, the wife of the President of the United States, who has become a key political player in America, much to the irritation of her opponents. The event, which will take place two days into the conference at the end of next month, will follow the publication of another report which is expected to reveal that Labour has failed to tackle disillusion among many women voters. The report by the IPPR will tackle criticisms that the Prime Minister has not modernised the Government quickly enough or led the pro-family reform of Parliament with sufficient vigour. It will form the basis of the debate that Mrs Blair will chair, a debate in which many Labour members are expected to attack the Government and the party's record on promoting a women-friendly image. Critics will also say that Labour has not done enough to get women MPs into winnable seats. Last night female MPs expressed delight at Mrs Blair's new role.

'Kosovo should have laid to rest any doubts about our strength in defence,' he wrote, but the war had not persuaded doubters that he was a patriot standing up for his country.</p> <p>Blair was quite right. It is bizarre to accuse him of not loving his country. The sole difficulty for his fellow citizens is the country he appears to adore like a cow-eyed teenager is the United States of America.</p> <p>Whoever wins the presidential election, America will break its obligations under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and install a National Missile Defence system to shoot down enemy warheads in mid-flight. Aggressive and defensive strategies complement rather than oppose each other. If you clear landmines in the approved Princess Di fashion, your troops can advance. If the US assumes the 'son of Star Wars' programme will allow it to blast missiles from the heavens it could order a nuclear assault with the belief or delusion that it will not risk the extinction of a slice of its population. Deterrence theory no longer holds.</p> <p>Every now and again the mask slips and staff officers speak plainly. The US Space Command - which coordinates the technological ambitions of the American army, navy and airforce - recently set out its 'Vision for 2020'. A Star Wars system would project military power 'across the full spectrum of conflict'. In other words, the US could attack without fear of reprisal as well as defend itself. The Cold War doctrine of mutually assured destruction is falsified. America can destroy without being destroyed.</p> <p>The British, meanwhile, could just be destroyed without having the vicarious satisfaction of knowing that our generals had exterminated hundreds of thousands in the minutes before the mushroom clouds bloomed. America needs the Fylingdales and Menwith Hill bases in North Yorkshire to pinpoint warheads. Any enemy of America would want to take them out. A defence system which protects America, but not Britain, will make Britain, in the words of Stephen I Schwartz, publisher of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, a 'prime target in the event of nuclear war'. If you want to overwhelm your enemy, you must overwhelm his defences. Only in this case America's defences will be on the Yorkshire Moors.</p> <p>Last week the Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs produced a report on the danger of weapons of mass destruction. The committee, dominated by usually loyal New Labour members, warned that American ambitions could start a global arms race. The 'threat' to the USA by 'rogue states' - Iraq, North Korea and the like - was probably fictitious, it concluded, and US trials suggested that Star Wars may no more work now than when Ronald Reagan first championed sci-fi defence in the Eighties. Yet even if the $50 billion programme is a fraud on the American taxpayer, perceptions more important than those of focus groups will bring danger. Russia, which is desperate to secure new nuclear control agreements because it cannot afford to replace its weapons, and China, whose warheads would be obsolete if Al Gore or George W. Bush pressed on with their armament programme, did not 'believe a word' of US assurances that Star Wars was purely defensive. If China increased its arsenal in response, then India would follow. If India armed, then so would Pakistan and the frightening instability of the sub-continent would become more terrifying still. Jacques Chirac said last month that American missile defence would encourage nuclear proliferation, as did Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. But from Britain, which might sabotage the project by refusing to turn its territory into a target, there has been silence.</p> <p>Admittedly, Peter Hain, the leftish Foreign Office Minister, did say in March: 'I don't like the idea of a Star Wars programme, limited or unlimited.' He was ordered to shut up. Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, has told friendly journalists that as America's most obedient ally we could not refuse a request to help. Tony Blair gave the impression in the Commons a few weeks ago that he hoped the ghastly business would go away.</p> <p>It won't. His Government believes in limiting the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons with international treaties. The United States wants to tear up the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the foundation of nuclear arms control. British foreign policy and our customary forelock tugging to the United States are incompatible.</p> <p>In their attempts to reconcile the irreconcilable, the Rolls-Royce minds of Whitehall have been tested to the limit. A joint memo from the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence tried to explain official thinking to bemused MPs. Allowing the Americans to use Fylingdales would breach the treaty, the mandarins conceded. But if the United States withdrew from the treaty, there would be no treaty. 'Its terms would no longer be operative' and therefore - and eureka! - the 'question of any possible breach of a treaty... would not appear to arise'. This is a like telling your bank that although you signed an agreement to pay off a loan, you have now decided to withdraw your custom and the manager has no right to ask for the bank's money back. Our finest and most ancient universities have sweated for years to produce civil servants who can parrot such sophistry without a blush.</p> <p>As ever, what concerns the Government is the PR. Ministers are worried that bowing to US demands will see a revival of anti-nuclear protest and the Yorkshire bases will become the Greenham Common of the new century. Blair wants to be perceived as tough on defence because in his mind Labour support for CND helped keep the party out of power in the Eighties by exposing it to the taunt that it would weaken Britain's defences. This time around, however, the roles will be reversed. The peaceniks will be defending Britain while their opponents will be leaving it open to attack.</p> <p>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori and all of that.

I just thought I'd stand up for unbridled British sexuality in the face of some unprovoked criticism from the land of leather-bound Uncle Sam. US porn star turned performance artist Annie Sprinkle is currently overpaid, oversexed and over here in an effort to persuade British women that porn is a 'good thing', which could enrich our lives if we could just unbutton our corsets and let it all hang out. She feels that Britain could 'learn a lot' from America, where censors are free and enlightened. Well, free and enlightened enough not to ban her porn videos, anyway. Sprinkle's latest movie, Herstory of Porn, is being shown at a London cinema as part of the Porno Chic season, which aims to demonstrate how pornography has entered the mainstream via advertising, the net and the arts. </p> <p>Sprinkle would like Herstory , which mainly comprises hardcore clips from her movies, to be embraced by the world of academia, but doesn't state whether that's with or without tongues. In one of her promotional pictures, Sprinkle is shown emerging, grinning zanily, like Ruth Madoc from Hi-De-Hi, from a giant vagina. As if this wasn't classy and academic enough, she describes herself as a 'pro-porn feminist'. Considering the porn industry's wretched track record in terms of the abuse of vulnerable females, some might view this as something of an oxymoron. Sprinkle argues that the only reason women don't like porn is because they are sexually inhibited and 'filled with shame' about their bodies. 'It's all about making people think,' she declares. And there we were thinking porn was all about making people do something entirely different ending with a 'k', but that's prudish, backward Britain for you. </p> <p>The Porno Chic season is right about one thing - pornography, albeit of the softest, coyest kind, has become a cornerstone of popular culture. Only this week, a new ad campaign for Persil washing-up liquid was unveiled, featuring the luscious Naomi Campbell wearing washing-up gloves and very little else. </p> <p>'What would it take to get me into rubber?' purrs the punchline. The ad is harmless enough, but still it says something that we've gone from: 'Mummy, why are your hands so soft?' to: 'Naomi, why are your thighs so toned?' Then there is Channel 5, where one can watch suburbanites in vinyl bustiers and leopard-print posing pouches talk frankly and openly about the fact that, once in a while, somebody gets desperate enough to fancy them. Watching these programmes, the thought occurs that some Brits aren't sexually inhibited enough. Tellingly, people on these shows rarely use words like 'penis' or 'vagina', never mind anything more Anglo-Saxon - it's all 'todger' this and 'love pocket' that, supporting my long-held suspicion that the more 'adult' the subject matter, the more infantile supposedly liberated people tend to get. </p> <p>In their efforts to feminise porn and yank it out of the traditional male enclave, Sprinkle, and other 'pro-porn feminists' peddle a variety of arguments, ranging from the comical and naive to the downright dangerous. Sprinkle and her ilk assert that porn helps stop rape and war. But, as anybody with half a brain knows, rape isn't about sex, it's about power and dominance. Whoever heard of a rapist forcing a woman to dominate him? Whoever heard of a submissive sexual assault? Who, for that matter, ever heard of a war starting because men weren't getting any? And while the stupidity of Sprinkle's arguments are grating, her arguments about women disliking pornography because they are 'scared', 'sexually repressed' and in need of enlightenment, are patronising, incorrect and more frayed than Jeff Stryker's favourite jockstrap. </p> <p>The fact is, if women were at all interested in porn, they would buy it, and indeed a growing minority do. We are the consumer sex, the gender renowned for our ruthless shopping instincts - nothing and nobody stops us from getting what we want. Have you seen us at the sales when we spot cut-price Agent Provocateur? Have you observed us screaming the house down for our rights in the workplace and the home? Why then do the likes of Sprinkle assume that women need their hands, or anything else, held when it comes to something as tacky and mundane as porn? </p> <p>It seems to me that, far from being scared or timid about porn, women have been voting with their purses all along. Decisions have been made that there are better things to get excited about than dodgy flicks or glossy skin rags, depicting total strangers getting laid. Like, for instance, getting laid yourself. Taking this into account, Sprinkle can grin zanily out of giant vaginas all she likes. All the evidence suggests that the average British woman will never be that interested in buying porn - she's too busy making her own. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>There was a point in his career when Tom Waits might have become one of the great American comedians. Nighthawks at the Diner , the live double album, released in 1975, is full of extravagantly tall stories, wild characters and witty one-liners; the music is wonderful and the words make you laugh. This successful fusion of comedy and music is extremely rare - you could add maybe Randy Newman and Leonard Cohen on certain records - but when it works, it makes for a sublime live experience. Otis Lee Crenshaw is exactly that. </p> <p>An ex-con country singer, created three years ago by classy US stand-up Rich Hall, Otis is a skinny, grizzled, sexy, world-weary, screwed-up but ineffably cool Tennessee dude. He wears a Confederate flag bandana and a sinister triangular goatee. As a boy, his family was so poor that 'blues singers used to come to our house when they had writer's block'. His guitarist introduces him as 'the man who makes Johnny Cash look like a goddam intellectual'. Otis has been married seven times - all to women named Brenda. 'It's just a coincidence,' he insists. 'The psychiatrists can make anything they like of that, but as my mom, Brenda, used to say...' </p> <p>Like Al Murray's Pub Landlord, whose throne as Edinburgh's favourite comic character Otis looks sure to take, he may be borderline psychotic, but he is, crucially, a lovable guy; Hall is made for this role, with his Mephistophelean handsomeness and that gravelly voice. </p> <p>The show is relaxed and slow-burning - part of me wishes he could go on all night, like a real country bar singer - but it's also stuffed to bursting with brilliant one-liners and great songs, all played with real fire and skill by his guitarist and bassist sidekicks, the Black Liars (Damian Coldwell and Christian Riley). </p> <p>Boldly, Otis doesn't play any of his old hits, such as 'He Almost Looks Like You' (a tender ballad about falling in love with his rapist cellmate), but concentrates exclusively on new material. The titles speak for themselves in most cases: 'Women Call It Stalking' (sample couplet: 'Tears fall down my face/ It might be love or it might be mace'); 'They Fought the Lawn (and the Lawn Won)', a song about all those great singers who died tragically in gardening accidents; 'Asses On Seats', about the grim realities of performing at the Edinburgh Festival; and 'Rodeo Man From the Shetland Islands' (sample couplet: 'Some folks say that they're too small/ I look like a monkey fucking a football'). </p> <p>But the most extraordinary song is 'Show Me on the Doll Where He Touched You' - a ballad about child abuse that is, however sick it sounds on paper, screamingly funny. In between songs, the patter is similar to Hall's 70 per cent improvised stand-up show - but filtered through Otis's deeper, darker psyche. He picks on a guy in the front row called Russ, who happens to run a bluegrass festival near Perth. 'OK, get your kneepads on, guys,' Otis instructs his cohorts, 'we've got some serious work to do.' </p> <p>This is the first-night preview, so the show is understandably threadbare in places, but when you have this much charm and talent, no one cares. A word of warning, though: astonishingly for a first night, Otis Lee Crenshaw was sold out. Asses on seats, baby, and maybe the Perrier Award to come. Better buy your tickets now, folks. </p> <p>Next to Otis, all other comics inevitably seem a little shrunken and one-dimensional. As <strong>Stewart Lee</strong> says at one point in his new show, Badly Mapped World , in the character of a returned astronaut, 'I've been to space. Going out to see the new Ben Elton film, Maybe Baby, can hold no thrills for me.' </p> <p>The show is his usual patchily inspired mix of pseudo-profundity and postmodern knob gags. The knob gags get the laughs. Lee challenges his audience's value systems. That gets a laugh too. And so on. If you've never seen him before, it will probably seem really fresh and original. If you have, you'll realise this talented man has been treading water for several years now. </p> <p>The more you see Lee's show, the more transparent the veil of mystery appears. Strip away his intensely stylised delivery - slow, sarcastic, agonisingly repetitious - and the actual jokes are mostly rather conventional: anti-American gags; pisstakes of people making obvious statements; observations on Australia; anti-German gags; pisstakes of Ben Elton and John Denver; observations on anal sex and his penis. </p> <p>There are a few great lines - he has always secretly known that he was Scottish because he 'craved shortbread, offal and heroin' - and a dazzling little section in which he does the sea diary of an owl, trapped in a rowing boat with a pussycat and a jar of honey, to the accompaniment of moody ambient music, like a TV documentary on Scott of the Antarctic. </p> <p>Twenty minutes of brilliance is, admittedly, more than you get in most stand-up shows, but you're still left with the slightly sour taste of someone whose abilities are only being half-used. If he's really so jaded by comedy - 'My job is going round the world, talking about scatalogical filth,' he says, 'which is a bit rubbish, in my opinion' - then maybe he should give it up and do something more fulfilling instead. </p> <p>Or maybe he should go and see <strong> Dave Gorman</strong>, who may lack Lee's gifts, but whose Edinburgh shows have the feel of a lifelong, personal mission rather than a rushed piece of homework. Where Lee's show is mushy and digressive, Gorman's has the hyperintense focus of true obsession. It is, basically, about how he sought out and met 25 other Dave Gormans around the world, recording their locations on a map and calculating a ratio of 'miles per dave gorman (mpdg)' on a graph. To his immense credit, he makes this process seem exciting and suspenseful, as well as funny. </p> <p>His quest, by the way, is ongoing. If your name is Dave Gorman, or if you know someone called Dave Gorman, or if you would - for a reward of \u00a3250 (or \u00a3300 if you're female) - like to change your name forever to Dave Gorman, then contact him at <a href=\"mailto:dave.gorman@virgin.net\">dave.gorman@virgin.net</a>.

      "bodyText": "There was a point in his career when Tom Waits might have become one of the great American comedians. Nighthawks at the Diner , the live double album, released in 1975, is full of extravagantly tall stories, wild characters and witty one-liners; the music is wonderful and the words make you laugh. This successful fusion of comedy and music is extremely rare - you could add maybe Randy Newman and Leonard Cohen on certain records - but when it works, it makes for a sublime live experience. Otis Lee Crenshaw is exactly that. An ex-con country singer, created three years ago by classy US stand-up Rich Hall, Otis is a skinny, grizzled, sexy, world-weary, screwed-up but ineffably cool Tennessee dude. He wears a Confederate flag bandana and a sinister triangular goatee. As a boy, his family was so poor that 'blues singers used to come to our house when they had writer's block'. His guitarist introduces him as 'the man who makes Johnny Cash look like a goddam intellectual'. Otis has been married seven times - all to women named Brenda. 'It's just a coincidence,' he insists. 'The psychiatrists can make anything they like of that, but as my mom, Brenda, used to say...' Like Al Murray's Pub Landlord, whose throne as Edinburgh's favourite comic character Otis looks sure to take, he may be borderline psychotic, but he is, crucially, a lovable guy; Hall is made for this role, with his Mephistophelean handsomeness and that gravelly voice. The show is relaxed and slow-burning - part of me wishes he could go on all night, like a real country bar singer - but it's also stuffed to bursting with brilliant one-liners and great songs, all played with real fire and skill by his guitarist and bassist sidekicks, the Black Liars (Damian Coldwell and Christian Riley). Boldly, Otis doesn't play any of his old hits, such as 'He Almost Looks Like You' (a tender ballad about falling in love with his rapist cellmate), but concentrates exclusively on new material. The titles speak for themselves in most cases: 'Women Call It Stalking' (sample couplet: 'Tears fall down my face/ It might be love or it might be mace'); 'They Fought the Lawn (and the Lawn Won)', a song about all those great singers who died tragically in gardening accidents; 'Asses On Seats', about the grim realities of performing at the Edinburgh Festival; and 'Rodeo Man From the Shetland Islands' (sample couplet: 'Some folks say that they're too small/ I look like a monkey fucking a football'). But the most extraordinary song is 'Show Me on the Doll Where He Touched You' - a ballad about child abuse that is, however sick it sounds on paper, screamingly funny. In between songs, the patter is similar to Hall's 70 per cent improvised stand-up show - but filtered through Otis's deeper, darker psyche. He picks on a guy in the front row called Russ, who happens to run a bluegrass festival near Perth. 'OK, get your kneepads on, guys,' Otis instructs his cohorts, 'we've got some serious work to do.' This is the first-night preview, so the show is understandably threadbare in places, but when you have this much charm and talent, no one cares. A word of warning, though: astonishingly for a first night, Otis Lee Crenshaw was sold out. Asses on seats, baby, and maybe the Perrier Award to come. Better buy your tickets now, folks. Next to Otis, all other comics inevitably seem a little shrunken and one-dimensional. As Stewart Lee says at one point in his new show, Badly Mapped World , in the character of a returned astronaut, 'I've been to space. Going out to see the new Ben Elton film, Maybe Baby, can hold no thrills for me.' The show is his usual patchily inspired mix of pseudo-profundity and postmodern knob gags. The knob gags get the laughs. Lee challenges his audience's value systems. That gets a laugh too. And so on. If you've never seen him before, it will probably seem really fresh and original. If you have, you'll realise this talented man has been treading water for several years now. The more you see Lee's show, the more transparent the veil of mystery appears. Strip away his intensely stylised delivery - slow, sarcastic, agonisingly repetitious - and the actual jokes are mostly rather conventional: anti-American gags; pisstakes of people making obvious statements; observations on Australia; anti-German gags; pisstakes of Ben Elton and John Denver; observations on anal sex and his penis. There are a few great lines - he has always secretly known that he was Scottish because he 'craved shortbread, offal and heroin' - and a dazzling little section in which he does the sea diary of an owl, trapped in a rowing boat with a pussycat and a jar of honey, to the accompaniment of moody ambient music, like a TV documentary on Scott of the Antarctic. Twenty minutes of brilliance is, admittedly, more than you get in most stand-up shows, but you're still left with the slightly sour taste of someone whose abilities are only being half-used. If he's really so jaded by comedy - 'My job is going round the world, talking about scatalogical filth,' he says, 'which is a bit rubbish, in my opinion' - then maybe he should give it up and do something more fulfilling instead. Or maybe he should go and see Dave Gorman, who may lack Lee's gifts, but whose Edinburgh shows have the feel of a lifelong, personal mission rather than a rushed piece of homework. Where Lee's show is mushy and digressive, Gorman's has the hyperintense focus of true obsession. It is, basically, about how he sought out and met 25 other Dave Gormans around the world, recording their locations on a map and calculating a ratio of 'miles per dave gorman (mpdg)' on a graph. To his immense credit, he makes this process seem exciting and suspenseful, as well as funny. His quest, by the way, is ongoing. If your name is Dave Gorman, or if you know someone called Dave Gorman, or if you would - for a reward of \u00a3250 (or \u00a3300 if you're female) - like to change your name forever to Dave Gorman, then contact him at dave.gorman@virgin.net. Or better still, go to the show and reveal yourself. Dave Gorman #1 will be thrilled. Away from the established names, there are of course plenty of up-and-coming comics at the Fringe - though none, as yet, who seem likely to have the explosive impact of The Mighty Boosh or Johnny Vegas in recent years. Addy Borgh is a charming, observational rambler. The Cambridge Footlights show, Sensible Haircut , is a sweet, intelligent, well-acted and mildly amusing play, showing its student roots with a satire of, um, Countdown. And The Comedy Zone, a showcase of new talent celebrating its tenth anniversary, is three-quarters not very good (the boyishly narcissistic Danny Bhoy; the remorselessly crude Karen Taylor; the grindingly mediocre Andy Zeltzman) and one-quarter great: the more off-beam, original Spencer Brown, who is like some weird amalgam of Frank Spencer, Sean Locke and Johnny Vaughan.

      "bodyText": "They are as French as foie gras, as rural as pain de campagne, as indispensable a part of a Gallic summer as an autoroute traffic jam. They are the British. New figures have revealed that more than half a million citizens of the United Kingdom now own property across the Channel. From the Cote d'Azur to the surf off Biarritz, from the rugged, dry hills of the Languedoc to the rolling fields of the Pas-de-Calais, the new wave of British second-home buyers is not so much arriviste as d\u00e9j\u00e0 arriv\u00e9 . The traditional hunting grounds of the British aristocracy looking for French estates have been abandoned. There are now no scions of ailing noble houses searching for sanctuaries from socialism and inheritance tax amid the hedgerows and cliff-top copses of Normandy and Brittany. Instead, the new buyers head straight for warmer climes, spending an average, according to figures compiled by Abbey National's European operations division, of \u00a3237,000 on a property in or around Nice and Cannes. Or, if a little more sportif , they head for the Alps. At least 10 per cent of properties bought in France last year by the British were in the mountains of Haute-Savoie, with an average of \u00a3242,000 each spent on homes in the extreme skiing Mecca of Chamonix. Mick Jagger may have his house in Cap Ferrat overlooking the Mediterranean and his chteau in the Loire valley, Tina Turner may have her home in Nice. But both are likely to find that their neighbours might be a little less exclusive than they had hoped. Nearly a million new homes have been built along the Cote d'Azur in recent years and, though estate agents say that the 'backlog' of saleable properties that made cottages in Provence such an attractive option 10 years ago has almost dried up, it is this construction boom that is fuelling current demand by keeping house prices down. 'The financial stakes are enormous on the coast,' said Daniel Canepa, prefect for the Var d\u00e9partement , which includes Saint-Tropez. And those Francophiles who bought their dream homes in the first heady rush of English property-buying more than a decade ago are feeling more than a little disillusioned. The ' nouveaux Beaujolais ' as house-hunters on the Cote d'Or are scornfully known, have turned whole hamlets into French-free zones. 'When we moved here it was wonderful... A genuine timeless, little French village tucked away from the hordes,' said one long-term English second-home owner speaking from their 'perfectly restored' farmer's cottage close to Dijon. 'Now all our neighbours are British. If I tried to buy some milk from the next door farm like I used to they'd think I was mad.' In the Dordogne, one of the first second-home buying locations and still popular, there are villages where up to 80 per cent of the resident population are foreigners, the majority of them British, and British car mechanics, electricians and painters and decorators have set up shop to serve them. The market is booming for very simple reasons. For the price of a nice one-bedroom flat in north London you will get a two-bedroom flat in Cannes or an older cottage-type villa in the hills behind the coast, according to David King, an estate agent specialising in mid-priced French property. 'For \u00a3300,000 you could get a very nice manor house in Gascony, old but in perfect condition with four or five acres of land,' he said. The strong pound is a major factor. Philip Hawkes, an agent who has dealt in chateaux for more than 20 years, said that demand is as strong as it has ever been.

In 1929, France had four million farms: it now has less than 750,000. The foreign influx has meant not just the restoration and renovation of local buildings that would otherwise have fallen derelict in their hundreds of thousands, but a welcome - and in some cases vital - source of additional income for builders, gardeners, odd-job men and shopkeepers. The generally taciturn rural French do not, however, expect their foreign residents to make too many demands on them. 'I get the feeling some Brits want to be seen as our friends,' said Laurent, a garage owner near Bergerac. 'Around here, unless your grandfather knew their grandfather, there's not much chance of being asked for dinner.' The highs...and the lows A three-course meal for two with bottle of wine costs about \u00a314 in France, \u00a330 for one in the UK. According to a survey by William M Mercer, Britons are 22 per cent worse off than the French. \u00a340,000 will barely buy a studio in London, but will get you a 20 sq metre flat in central Paris. \u00a3150,000 can buy a one-bed flat in London. A british couple bought a 11-bedroom chateau near Toulouse, with walled courtyard, barn and five acres of woods for the same sum. The french minimum wage: just up 3 per cent to \u00a3679 a month. Our minimum wage: \u00a33.60 an hour. The british work the longest hours in the European Union; the average week is 44 hours, compared with the French 40 hours, and less with new law. The french enjoy six weeks annual leave or more, Britons get four weeks or less. There are three bank holidays in England outside Easter and Christmas; in France there are nine. Exchange rate: five years ago we got around 7.75 francs to the \u00a3, now 10.45. Get drunk for less: an average can of lagers costs 92p here; 36p in France. The french have more sex than anyone in European Union - more than 130 times a year. Estate agents' fees in France can add up to 15 per cent to the property's sale price, compared with an average of 2.5 per cent in the UK. When you agree to buy a French property you immediately have to make a 10 per cent deposit of the value of the sale. If you die, your property is divided between your partner and your children; in the UK it goes to your partner. Prices are rising. Ten years ago it was possible to buy a derelict farmhouse in the French Pyrenees for \u00a310,000. The french are moving here. In 1971 there were 21,000 French-born citizens living in Britain. Now there are 250,000. Around 150,000 french entrepreneurs have crossed the Channel to Britain since 1995 ( Le Figaro ). More than 50 french millionaires moved to the UK in 1999 Unemployment in France is at 10.4 per cent, in Britain it is 5.6 per cent In 1990 britons bought up nearly 15 per cent of land in the Dordogne, buying some 14,000 homes You might bump into Peter Mayle",

      "bodyText": "It begins with a dream of winning \u00a370,000. It ends in rejection and character assassination in front of a live television audience of millions. Sada Walkington and Andrew Davidson, thrown out of Channel 4's Big Brother house, have been reviled as lazy, selfish, and conspiratorial. Their only claim to fame is being unpopular. But rejection pays. Stars of the top-rated TV show are cashing in on their 15 minutes of infamy by cutting the sort of deals that would make TV professionals weep. Sada, the self-styled hippy love goddess who said she was so good-hearted she could not even kill a mosquito, has negotiated with Max Clifford, the king of celebrity spin, to sell her story to tabloid newspapers for a rumoured \u00a325,000. Her agent is charging magazines more than \u00a310,000 for photographs and thousands of pounds for interviews. She is also expected to rake in thousands by appearing on TV chat shows. Channel 4 has hired her as a television reviewer on the Big Breakfast. Mitsubishi, the Japanese car firm, has offered her a free 4x4 car and one manufacturer has asked her to sponsor a line of 'Sada crystal balls'. The contestants who remain in the house are getting offers via email, but they will not be able to read them until viewers vote them out. Publishers want the two Big Brother lovers, Mel and Andrew, who had their first screen kiss before Andrew was kicked out on Friday, to pen a novel about falling in love in front of a live 24-hour audience of millions. There is a plan for them to host a revamped version of the Eighties gameshow Mr and Mrs. Loaded, the lads' magazine, is bidding for a photo-spread with Big Brother 'babe' Mel and wants to hire the duplicitous stockbroker Nick. 'He could write a column called \"Nick's Lies\", suggesting various unscrupulous ways for our readers to obtain stuff they can't get and deceive loved ones,' the magazine's features editor, Danny Plunkett said. Gay magazine Boyz is eyeing up scouser Craig to be its centrefold. 'He's the sort of straight man gay men fancy. He's a muscle-bound bit of rough,' editor David Hudson said. Underground film-makers are rumoured to be lining up former nun and lesbian Anna to appear in a soft porn movie. Hello!, the celebrity life-style weekly, is in talks to do an 'at home' spread with the winner of the competition. Record companies are lining up a single to turn one contestant into a one-hit wonder. And there is up to \u00a350,000 on offer for the first couple to have sex in the house. 'When two participants in the Dutch version of Big Brother slept together they became very valuable to advertisers,' a spokesman for the programme's sponsors, Southern Comfort, said. 'We're in the process of securing the rights to negotiate with any participants who sleep with each other, which could mean a contract worth around \u00a350,000.' Keith Woodhams, talent manager at Bazal Productions, the company that makes the programme, said yesterday interest in the Big Brother contestants was 'massive'. It mirrors the experience of inmates in overseas versions of the spy-on-the-wall show in which contestants are filmed 24 hours a day and highlights are screened every night. John, who won the German version of the show, is now a pop star - his imaginatively titled hit single, Gewinner (Winner). Zlatko, another contestant who was booted out in week six, has had a beer named after him. In the Netherlands, Bart and Sabine, who had sex, have posed for Playboy magazine and now work in television. Mark Frith, the editor of the showbusiness magazine Heat, says the contestants have clawed their way up from nobodies to achieve celebrity status and it is no surprise they are cashing in. 'They have gone from nowhere straight onto the B-list and some are becoming celebrities in their own right,' he says. 'If you put anyone on TV for long enough, they will become famous. 'There is a whole generation raised on soaps and fly-on-the-wall programmes who are fascinated with A-list stars but identify more with the ordinary Joe.' Peter Bazalgette, boss of Bazal productions, said: 'For the people in the house it is about fame. If they go on and make a career for themselves, good luck to them.' john.arlidge@observer.co.uk Golden futures How much will they earn? What the future could hold... Mel - \u00a380,000. Hello! magazine 'at home' spread with Andrew. She dumps him for a boy band singer, strips for Loaded and gets a job as a presenter on MTV. Andrew - \u00a340,000.

Increasing isolation caused by an inability to build the same social networks as women is being blamed for the rising number of self-inflicted deaths among what experts now call the post-Victor Meldrew generation. The phenomena will be highlighted in the end of the television series One Foot in the Grave , when Meldrew kills himself with an as yet undisclosed technique. Hanging and overdosing are the most common real-life ways. </p> <p>Dr Michael Dennis, a psychiatry specialist at the University of Leicester, said: 'A growing concern is the much greater emotional stress associated with widowhood for elderly men. They simply don't expect to outlive their spouses. It's almost expected for elderly women to live longer than their husbands, but that is changing. </p> <p>'Men are also still affected by the loss of a significant role in later life. They are suffering from the work ethos of thinking they were once carrying out valued activities for society. With that comes hopelessness and despair.' </p> <p>While there were nine suicides for every 100,000 men aged 15-24 last year, the rate among the over-85s has climbed to 25 deaths per 100,000. 'It's a very worrying trend,' said Tessa Harding of Help the Aged. 'There are almost certainly an additional number of hidden suicides. Self-harm is often not classified as suicide, even when it is. </p> <p>'We face increasing evidence that these problems are mobility-related too. When people can't visit friends, or friends don't visit them, they become more and more isolated. Life loses meaning.' </p> <p>Older men are also suffering a lifelong inability to create the networks that women build through family and home. 'Male friendships still tend to be about going to the pub, or the club or the match,' said Harding. 'It hits them harder when this becomes more difficult.' </p> <p>In a recent study of elderly suicide cases in London, 16 per cent of victims had had no contact with family or friends and 9 per cent admitted loneliness in a suicide note. </p> <p>Jeanne Coster, a 90-year old former boutique assistant from Essex, said: 'The older I get, the more sympathy I've had with men. It's rougher when they retire. So many of their pals are at work, whether that's digging roads or in an office. That's where their social networks are. I feel sorry for them. </p> <p>'For most women, life doesn't change so much at retirement,' said Mrs Coster. 'You still have the housework and the shopping to do, whether you worked before or not. I do my best to ensure I see friends regularly and I'm lucky to have a very attentive family. I still have a good social life, even though I'm less active physically than I was.' </p> <p>Harding said: 'Purposeful social activity can be every bit as beneficial as physical activity. Men don't always appreciate this as their physical capacities decline. </p> <p>'Over 85s become particularly vulnerable to suicide when they start seeing multiple losses of family and friends. They find it more difficult to maintain contact, even on the phone. A lot of older people are also careful about how much they use the phone because of the expense. </p> <p>'People do look at older individuals such as the Queen Mother and think that life is great. But she has friendships and networks which are not available to others.' </p> <p>Dennis cautioned: 'Elderly people who kill themselves often have some form of mental disorder. Ninety per cent appear to have been suffering from depression. A lot are in poor physical health which can contribute to depressive illness. We need to become better at recognising when people have chronic disabling illness or associated chronic pain so we can help them. Often, older men will say nothing about this.' </p> <p>During the past three decades, levels of suicide among young men have been regarded by the Department of Health and family experts as a priority for prevention. Widespread youth unemployment and increasing independence among young women has led to some younger men feeling inadequate. Among those who attempt suicide, it is men of all ages who tend to be more successful because they are more likely to use violent methods, most usually hanging or shooting.

At work, look out for the people with the messy desks and the reputation for being underhand and manipulative, the bullying boss who never listens to your advice, and the colleague who tells blatant lies. They are the ones destined to triumph. These are the findings of an in-depth exploration of greatness which reveals that a person's personality type is a clear indicator of success. The research, presented yesterday to the American Psychological Association conference in Washington, examined the traits of the most successful men in US history - all 41 Presidents - and compared them to more average individuals. The truth, according to Texas academic Dr Steven Rubenzer and colleagues from the University of Minnesota, is that being nice gets you nowhere - not to the White House or Number 10 or even on to a parish council. The researchers discovered that the great Presidents were low on straightforwardness, vulnerability and order. 'The very characteristics which mark people out as an unattractive choice as a spouse or a neighbour make them successful as leaders,' said Rubenzer. 'One real surprise was that people who are a little dis-organised do a bit better. Abraham Lincoln was notoriously untidy, and it certainly seems to be an asset.' The psychologists asked 100 biographers and historians to help them fill in questionnaires and then scored them on 592 different characteristics. Forcefulness, the willingness to flatter and manipulate, egotism and assertiveness all seemed to help push Presidents up the ladder of greatness. Rubenzer and his team believe the same applies to success in every walk of life. The completed personality profiles showed strong links between the characters of the great, and common traits among the bad. 'As far as the UK goes, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher fit right into our model. Stubborn, assertive and socially often obnoxious - just the right stuff to make them great figures in history. 'This research can equally be applied as a measure of who will succeed in the world of business and the workplace,' said Rubenzer. The team further categorised the Presidents into eight personality types - innocents, autocrats, good guys, introverts, actors, philosophers, extroverts and maintainers. 'As far as leaders go, the innocents definitely fare the worst,' said Rubenzer. 'John Major we would categorise as an \"innocent\" - in other words he isn't going to get a lot of space in the history book.'

      "bodyText": "No matter whether you are Pisces, Virgo or Cancer, the warning for this week is the same for every astrological sign - poring over your horoscope can damage your mental health. If you take star signs too seriously or if you worry unduly about walking under a ladder, you are actually stunting your intelligence and making yourself depressed. Psychologists have discovered a strong link between belief in superstition and poor exam performance in academics. They also found that those students who took account of black cats and Friday the 13th were far more likely to be neurotic and depressed and with a lower IQ than their more sceptical counterparts. But the one exception was even more out of this world. If you ignore all the other phenomenon but believe in UFOs, then go to the top of the class. A healthy dose of open-mindedness to the existence of extraterrestrials means you are more likely to be of a higher intelligence. The team of researchers led by Dr Michael Sonntag of the University of Lander in Greenwood, South Carolina, devised a scoring test to question people about their reactions to a range of superstitions including witchcraft, premonition, ghosts and astrology. Presenting the group's finding to the annual conference of the American Psychological Association in Washington this weekend, Sonntag said beliefs were more prevalent among students in the humanities, arts, teacher training and business studies while those who had chosen mathematics and sciences were far more likely to dismiss them. Sonntag also suggested that the growing tendency towards horoscopes and belief in the paranormal in Western society could mean that the higher education system was failing people in not managing to make children 'capable of critical analysis of information'. 'The results generally support the stereotype that belief in the paranormal is associated with poorer academic performance,' said Sonntag. 'In particular, belief in the most simple of superstitions such as black cats, broken mirrors and the number 13 were found to be related to the lowest intelligence scores.' From both his research and after assessing previous research done on similar topics, Sonntag concluded that 'superstitious behaviour appears to be associated with a host of socially less favourable attributes such as neuroticism, depression and lower intelligence'. Next time you feel the need to check your horoscope, resist: it may only bring you bad luck.",

      "body": "<p>The deep, flat blistered land stretches out across the Southern basin. Mississippi makes for brutally beautiful country - a state haunted by the spectre of racial intolerance and economic dilapidation.</p> <p>A three-year drought has ravaged the land, ruining the yield of corn by up to 50 per cent. Driving past the Jackson city limits, farmer Ben Burkett looks enviously at the corn stalks, their golden ears drooping earthwards. 'They is ready for the picking,' he says.</p> <p>Black farmers in the US are facing their worst crisis in almost 50 years. Decades of federal funding shortfalls, racism and harvests undercut by imports have seen their agrarian tradition decline to an imperilled profession.</p> <p>In January 1999, the US government agreed to pay $375 million to more than 20,000 farmers who alleged years of racial discrimination in loans and subsidies. A class action filed in 1997 by the National Black Farmers' Association was settled after the Department of Agriculture admitted, not racism, but bureaucratic delay. And a report, published last February by the Farm Service Agency, revealed farmers over the past 20 years had applied for loans well in advance of the planting season, to be told no funds were available.</p> <p>To date, only 61 per cent of the claims have been settled - with a maximum payment of $50,000. And, like other farmers in the region, Burkett has had to diversify his crops to keep his farm from foreclosure: he now plants soya beans as well as cotton. He is state director at the Federation of Southern Co-operatives Land Assistance Fund - a local outreach programme.</p> <p>His family has been farming in the region since 1886 - and Burkett hopes his daughter will strengthen the family's ties to the land.

      "bodyText": "The deep, flat blistered land stretches out across the Southern basin. Mississippi makes for brutally beautiful country - a state haunted by the spectre of racial intolerance and economic dilapidation. A three-year drought has ravaged the land, ruining the yield of corn by up to 50 per cent. Driving past the Jackson city limits, farmer Ben Burkett looks enviously at the corn stalks, their golden ears drooping earthwards. 'They is ready for the picking,' he says. Black farmers in the US are facing their worst crisis in almost 50 years. Decades of federal funding shortfalls, racism and harvests undercut by imports have seen their agrarian tradition decline to an imperilled profession. In January 1999, the US government agreed to pay $375 million to more than 20,000 farmers who alleged years of racial discrimination in loans and subsidies. A class action filed in 1997 by the National Black Farmers' Association was settled after the Department of Agriculture admitted, not racism, but bureaucratic delay. And a report, published last February by the Farm Service Agency, revealed farmers over the past 20 years had applied for loans well in advance of the planting season, to be told no funds were available. To date, only 61 per cent of the claims have been settled - with a maximum payment of $50,000. And, like other farmers in the region, Burkett has had to diversify his crops to keep his farm from foreclosure: he now plants soya beans as well as cotton. He is state director at the Federation of Southern Co-operatives Land Assistance Fund - a local outreach programme. His family has been farming in the region since 1886 - and Burkett hopes his daughter will strengthen the family's ties to the land. 'But the kids don't wanna work on the farms. The few that don't end up in jail or on drugs get jobs in the North.' Migration to cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York is not the only cause of Mississippi's black brain drain. The state penitentiary system houses 19,000 prisoners - 80 per cent of them black. The marginalisation of a generation has had a catastrophic effect on agriculture in the area: on average, the black farmer is now 70 years old.

Each month, he dispatches a truckload of freshly frozen vegetables to Chicago - to Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam. The vegetables are regenerated as pies and pastries sold in the Nation's bakeries. 'It's a good deal, and it helps me move my stock,' says Burkett.

If, like many people, you have more than 20 messages a day, then using a cellphone to collect email isn't going to be cost-effective for the customer - but will be good for the stock value of service provider. As for 'surfing the web' from your mobile phone, think again. Until we move away from the current infrastructure, as a technical solution this is only marginally superior to two tin cans and a piece of string. I have to sympathise with the man from Microsoft, who most recently described Wap as a short-term compromise until something better comes along. You see, Wap as it's being sold, or oversold, represents a promise for the future, an expensive way of introducing the public to third-generation mobile phone services before they actually arrive. Having just spent an obscene amount of money on the licences, the industry is between technologies but needs to keep the interest of the public, which demands remarkable efforts by the advertising men. Thinking back to Clive Sinclair's first personal computer, there's a fine line between innovative gimmickry and revolutionary technology. As a consequence, it may be true to say that Wap, or internet-enabled cellular telephony, has a good 18 months in front of it before it's ready to alter our lives. \u0095 Simon Moores is chairman of IT analyst The Research Group. \u0095 John Naughton is on holiday",

The Scottish bank promised \u00a31.57 billion of cost savings and revenue benefits during the bid, upgrading that to \u00a31.93bn 30 days after the deal was completed. It would be surprising if, only four months later, it was saying anything different. </p> <p>It would be equally surprising if the first set of results since the bid were anything other than sparkling, and Royal Bank duly obliged. It has already increased revenues at NatWest by \u00a346 million, boosting profits by \u00a35m. It expects \u00a3120m by the year end, and double that in 2001. </p> <p>Costs have been shaved by \u00a3360m, although 60 per cent of that was achieved by the old NatWest management, and it is on target to increase that to \u00a3550m by December and \u00a3900m next year. More than 40 per cent of the 18,000 job cuts involved have already been made. </p> <p>The City was impressed by more than just the progress on integration. Revenues of the combined group grew by 10 per cent - or 7 per cent, excluding the benefit of acquisitions. Cost rose by just 4 per cent, on the same basis, so efficiency continues to improve. </p> <p>But that, too, should have been no surprise: simply combining Royal Bank's historically healthy growth rate with NatWest's rather anaemic one would have produced decent income rises. </p> <p>That does not mean that the jump in the share price, which continued a rising trend, is not justified. Royal's shares had been marked down so far since the bid that they were looking ridiculously cheap: recovery was long overdue. </p> <p>Even after the 20 per cent increase, they are still rated below peers such as Barclays and LloydsTSB which will struggle to deliver the kind of growth Royal should achieve. </p> <p>But the rise should not be attributed to the success of the acquisition: it will take years, not months, to judge whether chief executive Fred Goodwin and his team can live up to their expectations. Buy the shares, but watch out for signs that the deal is going wrong. </p> <p><strong> Method in Pearson madness</strong><br> </p> <p>Over the past year, Pearson's shares have risen from a low of 1,160p to 2,000p at the start of last week. Why, then, is the media group issuing new shares at 1,000p to finance the $2.5 billion (\u00a31.7bn) cost of buying National Computer Systems, one of the leading US educational services companies? </p> <p>The answer is simple: cost. In a conventional rights issue, priced at a discount of perhaps 10 per cent to its share price, the investment bank, lead underwriter and sub-underwriters all have to have their cut. The result is fees of around 2 per cent of the issue - or more than \u00a334m in this case. By pricing the rights issue at such a deep discount, Pearson has managed to cut the fees to just 0.5 per cent of the issue, or \u00a37.5m. </p> <p>For shareholders, the price of the rights issue is irrelevant. They are being asked for a specific sum of money; whether it is divided up into shares of \u00a31 or \u00a31,000 is irrelevant. Provided they take up their rights, their stake in the company remains the same. </p> <p>But there are two caveats. First, those who do not take up their rights - and many private investors do not - have their shareholdings more severely diluted. Second, unless the company adjusts the amount of the dividend per share to take account of the extra ones issued, it can work out an expensive method of finance. </p> <p>Pearson says it will do this. It will pay the same total amount of dividend but, because it will be split between a larger number of shares, the nominal amount will fall. The fear that investors will not understand the logic of this, and will see the adjustment as a dividend cut, puts other companies off deeply divided rights issues. </p> <p>Pearson shares suffered initially from its pioneering move.That was unfair. The acquisition of NCS confirms it as one of the leading international information groups. The method of financing does not change that. </p> <p><strong> Way down south in Baltimore</strong><br> </p> <p>Baltimore Technologies is doing all the right things. One of the best and most innovative suppliers of internet security products, it is working hard at cornering the market. </p> <p>The market is expanding rapidly. The National Consumer Council warned last week that concern about security is deterring consumers from trading online, the travails of Barclays on-line banking service (not a Baltimore customer) shows their concern is justified. Baltimore is proving expert at exploiting these concerns. </p> <p>In less than two years, it has opened about 30 offices covering key areas in Europe, Asia and the US; it has signed no less than 248 partnerships, with, among others, IT blue chips such as Unisys, Cisco, Andersen Consulting and, last week, CommerceOne. Last year's UK listing has left it with \u00a3100m of cash, enough to finance its growth for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>Its efforts are paying off handsomely. In the six months to the end of June, its revenues more than doubled, from \u00a39.8m to \u00a325.7m. More than half that revenue now comes from licence agreements with its many partners. Costs rose too but, at 94 per cent, the increase is much lower than the rate of rise in revenue. Of course, losses were also higher, at \u00a320.7m compared with \u00a316m last time, but chief executive Fran Rooney is confident Baltimore will be in profit by 2002. </p> <p>If he is right - and two years is a long time on the internet - that profit is likely to be measured in tens of millions at best. It is likely to take at least five years to get to hundreds of millions. That is not unusual for what is effectively a start-up. What is unusual is that the start-up is valued at \u00a32.8bn - 28 times its forecast sales for 2001. A company valued at that multiple would look expensive. Analysts justify the rating by the explosive growth expected in the market. </p> <p>Those investing hard-earned cash may prefer to wait for a little more evidence that Baltimore can prosper from it before buying the shares.</p>",

The answer is simple: cost. In a conventional rights issue, priced at a discount of perhaps 10 per cent to its share price, the investment bank, lead underwriter and sub-underwriters all have to have their cut. The result is fees of around 2 per cent of the issue - or more than \u00a334m in this case. By pricing the rights issue at such a deep discount, Pearson has managed to cut the fees to just 0.5 per cent of the issue, or \u00a37.5m. For shareholders, the price of the rights issue is irrelevant. They are being asked for a specific sum of money; whether it is divided up into shares of \u00a31 or \u00a31,000 is irrelevant. Provided they take up their rights, their stake in the company remains the same. But there are two caveats. First, those who do not take up their rights - and many private investors do not - have their shareholdings more severely diluted. Second, unless the company adjusts the amount of the dividend per share to take account of the extra ones issued, it can work out an expensive method of finance. Pearson says it will do this. It will pay the same total amount of dividend but, because it will be split between a larger number of shares, the nominal amount will fall. The fear that investors will not understand the logic of this, and will see the adjustment as a dividend cut, puts other companies off deeply divided rights issues. Pearson shares suffered initially from its pioneering move.That was unfair. The acquisition of NCS confirms it as one of the leading international information groups. The method of financing does not change that. Way down south in Baltimore Baltimore Technologies is doing all the right things. One of the best and most innovative suppliers of internet security products, it is working hard at cornering the market. The market is expanding rapidly. The National Consumer Council warned last week that concern about security is deterring consumers from trading online, the travails of Barclays on-line banking service (not a Baltimore customer) shows their concern is justified. Baltimore is proving expert at exploiting these concerns. In less than two years, it has opened about 30 offices covering key areas in Europe, Asia and the US; it has signed no less than 248 partnerships, with, among others, IT blue chips such as Unisys, Cisco, Andersen Consulting and, last week, CommerceOne. Last year's UK listing has left it with \u00a3100m of cash, enough to finance its growth for the foreseeable future. Its efforts are paying off handsomely. In the six months to the end of June, its revenues more than doubled, from \u00a39.8m to \u00a325.7m. More than half that revenue now comes from licence agreements with its many partners. Costs rose too but, at 94 per cent, the increase is much lower than the rate of rise in revenue. Of course, losses were also higher, at \u00a320.7m compared with \u00a316m last time, but chief executive Fran Rooney is confident Baltimore will be in profit by 2002. If he is right - and two years is a long time on the internet - that profit is likely to be measured in tens of millions at best. It is likely to take at least five years to get to hundreds of millions. That is not unusual for what is effectively a start-up. What is unusual is that the start-up is valued at \u00a32.8bn - 28 times its forecast sales for 2001. A company valued at that multiple would look expensive. Analysts justify the rating by the explosive growth expected in the market. Those investing hard-earned cash may prefer to wait for a little more evidence that Baltimore can prosper from it before buying the shares.",

For retailers, managing the weather effectively can be the difference between a good and a bad trading statement. Run out of barbecue food - a market worth nearly \u00a3200 million a year in the UK, according to analysts at Mintel - and a retailer won't just be ruing the day he failed to order more chicken drumsticks. 'If you don't stock a product when the customer comes in, then you've lost them. Empty shelves create a very negative image,' said Jill Rawlins, spokeswoman for Somerfield. </p> <p>The supermarket chain, like all of its rivals, employs a 'just-in-time' system when working out what to ship to its 650 stores from its warehouse depots.

But it can pose real dilemmas for what to do with cheaper products. </p> <p>For example, the demand for salt rises dramatically during cold snaps, as consumers sprinkle it over their drives to thaw ice. But salt is a low-value product that takes up large amounts of space in warehouses. 'All the time we're employing stock management. What we're trying to do is reduce the amount of stock sitting in depots, because that's money tied up,' Rawlins said. </p> <p>Increasingly, this means the big retailers and food suppliers are looking to scientific methods to calculate how they should react to changes in weather patterns. </p> <p>Tesco, for example, uses 14-day weather forecasts, which are monitored every day. These are compared with weather patterns and sales figures for the same period the previous year, helping the retailer judge how consumers will react. A software system then 'balances' Tesco's order book so that if demand is increased for fresh fruit and vegetables the supply of winter food such as soups is reduced. Other staple products that are given reduced aisle space include sausage rolls, joints of beef and ready meals. </p> <p>Similarly, Sainsbury has a dedicated team of six weather analysts based at its Blackfriars HQ in London who spend their days scrutinising weather charts. The analysts can draw on archived data going back over the last two years. </p> <p>The team examines the data on a regional basis, as this helps them structure their supply chains more efficiently. </p> <p>'If you think of the effect of hot weather on the coast, it's disproportionately higher than, say, in central Scotland,' said Simon Skeet, perishable supply chain manager with Sainsbury. </p> <p>Skeet has detected a change in the way the big retailers react to weather conditions now compared with five years ago. 'Back then it was up to each individual store to decide how to react.

Today this process - known in the industry as the 'lead time' - takes just 72 hours. This is good news for the supermarkets, which can largely dictate when they receive goods from their suppliers, thanks to their strong market positions. </p> <p>But it also means the suppliers often have to perform a tricky equation - balancing the supermarkets' desire to have goods shipped to their depots at the last minute with the problem of building up too much inventory. </p> <p>'We regard the ice cream season as being from Good Friday to the end of August. We know it's going to be hot, but we don't know when, so we hoard stocks ready for the good weather,' said a sales manager with one UK ice cream firm. </p> <p>But, of course, a continued spell of bad weather means the stockpiles continue to build up - putting pressure on the supplier to take the plunge and start looking to shift inventory, known in the industry as 'call time'. </p> <p>'We're in call time at the moment. We've just had the coldest June in years, the summer holidays have begun, and there's just six weeks to go. How do you call it?' the sales manager said. </p> <p>'In a good week in the summer - for instance, July last year - we sold 50 million ice creams. But in a bad week in the summer we sell only 30 million ice creams,' said Simon Stevens of Walls Ice Cream, a division of consumer goods giant Unilever. </p> <p>Trying to establish the way the weather influences the relationship between supply and demand is becoming the domain of mathematicians. It is not simply the case that hot weather equals greater ice cream sales, for example. If temperatures exceed around 20C, consumer take-up of ice cream starts to rocket.

The British International Freight Association (BIFA) said that independent UK road hauliers, which deliver containers to and from ports, were being driven out of business by the price-undercutting tactics of giant truck fleets under contract to the shipping lines, including P&amp;O Nedlloyd, Hapag Lloyd, Evergreen, Maersk and Mitsui. Leading store chains such as Boots, Tesco and B&amp;Q have been warned that their supply of stocks from overseas is under threat. Colin Beaumont, BIFA director general, said that booming international trade combined with a growing shortage of road and rail transport - exacerbated by the freight industry row and soaring UK haulage costs - meant retailers could suffer. The shipping lines are allowed to fix prices for the port-to-port part of the journey under international agreements designed to prevent cutthroat competition in an inherently unstable business. But under the Treaty of Rome, the European Commission does not allow this price fixing to extend 'door to door'; there has to be open competition when the freight is being transported on land. 'The shipping lines have tried to extend price-fixing beyond the ports for the entire length of the transport chain,' said Beaumont. 'We believe there is an ele ment of collusion going on.

      "body": "<p>There were doubts whether Nicky Oppenheimer was really cut out to follow in his father's and grandfather's footsteps as head of the De Beers diamond empire. But in his two-and-a-half years in charge, the diffident old Harrovian has - on the face of it, at least - turned the precious gems giant upside down. </p> <p>First, De Beers' rag-bag collection of non-diamond interests, from platinum to paper-making, were parcelled off to Anglo-American, the other main prop of the Oppenheimer dynasty. Then, earlier this year, De Beers turned 'ethical', shunning conflict zone diamonds and calling for tough action against the arms-for-diamonds trade. </p> <p>Coming from a company that for 60 years had ruthlessly enforced its control of a world cartel, the swift move took even hard-bitten human rights campaigners by surprise. </p> <p>And a month ago, De Beers scrapped the cartel itself. No longer would it control prices by cajoling rivals and mopping up gems into its vast stockpile. Instead, it would compete for custom by pushing the De Beers brand, first and foremost. </p> <p>And now, it has launched not one, but two takeovers for rival diamond producers. The hostile bids are the first in De Beers' 120-year history. But each - for Canadian minnow Winspear last month and for Australia's established Ashton Mining last week - shows how change has been forced by commercial reality rather than corporate penitence. As one City mining analyst said: 'The leopard has not so much changed its spots, but altered its hunting habits.' </p> <p>In De Beers' new world, the US$175 million bid for Winspear, Canada's number three diamond firm, is straightforward. From nothing two years ago, Canada is shortly set to produce over $1 billion of diamonds a year. De Beers' long prospecting efforts, however, have yielded little. And mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP, meanwhile, have stolen a march with joint ventures with Canada's leading firms, Diamet and Aber Resources. Canadian diamonds, too, are a valuable 'conflict-free' source to sell under De Beers' own brand into the US, the world's biggest market by far. </p> <p>Last week's $305m assault on Ashton, however, is set to test how De Beers' new image matches reality. </p> <p>Ashton owns 40 per cent of Australia's Argyle, the world's biggest diamond mine. Argyle's output of smaller, lower value gems - and prized pink diamonds - would fill a hole in the range from De Beers' own 20 mines in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. But the battle promises to be bitter. For starters, the remaining 60 per cent of Argyle is owned by Britain's Rio Tinto, the world's largest mining company, which is considering a counter-bid. Rio and Ashton have already upset De Beers once, by pulling out of its cartel in 1996. And the Oppenheimers have not had it all their own way of late in pursuing their new aggressive tack. Last week, Anglo American pulled out of the bidding for Australian iron ore producer North when Rio trumped it with a $2bn offer. </p> <p>'If it wins, De Beers will know all about Argyle's trading. But Rio and Ashton won't know about De Beers,' said analyst Roger Chaplin of broker Canaccord. 'That's a little unfair. But that's the way De Beers likes it.' </p> <p>A smaller part of Ashton's portfolio, however, may yet cause De Beers most embarrassment. SDM is Ashton's most promising African venture, mining alluvial diamonds from the Cuango river in northern Angola. But the project would take De Beers firmly back into the world's top diamond trouble spot, a country still racked by civil war between the elected government and Unita rebels. </p> <p>Last October, De Beers placed an embargo on diamond purchases from Angola just as the UN was gearing up to toughen sanctions. In the industry, however, the move was seen as much as a response to commercial pressures as the prelude to a new ethical approach. 'The whole stance De Beers took was public relations-related, as they also had to deal with their stockpile,' one De Beers watcher said. </p> <p>The embargo was certainly not complete. Ashton, Brazilian mining group Odebrecht and Angolan state-owned Endiama share ownership of SDM. From 1998 all diamond sales, however, were handled by De Beers, a contract it exempted from the embargo. </p> <p>The Cuango Valley and SDM are now government-controlled, but the security situation remains tense. For its part, De Beers has always denied buying diamonds from Unita. But legitimate as the SDM venture may seem, in Angola it is quite possible that Unita diamonds may reach the market as part of SDM sales. </p> <p>'Until such time as De Beers and the industry put in place an independent system of verification, all \"non-conflict diamond\" guarantees have to be treated with caution,' said Charmian Gooch, director of campaigning group Global Witness. </p> <p>In fact, following De Beers' embargo earlier this year Angola pulled the rug on the SDM marketing deal. And De Beers' response shows how keen it is not to be sidelined. In March, it had the Belgian authorities impound a consignment of SDM diamonds bound for Antwerp and rival firm Ascorp, part-owned by colourful Israel-Russian diamond dealer, Lev Leviev. </p> <p>Since the embargo, Angola has put its diamond dealings in the hands of Leviev, who is also believed to have ambitions to usurp De Beers' contracts with Russia. His involvement with the Angolan government gives campaigners cause for concern about all the country's diamond dealings. One of Leviev's leading contacts in Angola is understood to be Arkadi Gaidamak, a well-connected French-based Russian arms dealer, who has been a major weapons supplier to the war-torn African state. </p> <p>De Beers has also never actually left Angola. Put simply, the world's fourth-biggest producer is too important for De Beers to ignore: 'As an African company we are determined to be there,' a De Beers spokesman said. </p> <p>It is still searching for new deposits, having discovered 41 new prospects in the past decade. And despite all its present difficulties with the Angolan government, De Beers is constructing a 17-storey diamond sorting base with Endiama in Luanda. </p> <p>'It's all about leverage and bargaining power with De Beers. It's a continual game of cat and mouse,' said Gooch. 'De Beers is in a process of reform - but only as long as the pressure is kept on.'</p>",

The return you get is linked to the FTSE 100. For every 1 per cent rise in the FTSE over that period, the investor gets a 1 per cent return on the amount invested. In a similar offering, Abbey National recently paid 0.07 per cent on its one-year stock market bond. On a \u00a310,000 deposit, the return was \u00a37.21.

      "bodyText": "It sounds tempting. You can get 'tax-free growth potential of up to 20 per cent' if you invest in Skipton Building Society's new 'unique two-year growth mini cash Isa'. But the reality is you could also get nil growth. The return you get is linked to the FTSE 100. For every 1 per cent rise in the FTSE over that period, the investor gets a 1 per cent return on the amount invested. In a similar offering, Abbey National recently paid 0.07 per cent on its one-year stock market bond. On a \u00a310,000 deposit, the return was \u00a37.21. Could the returns be as poor on this product? Of course. If an investor had put \u00a33,000 - the deposit Skipton requires for this product - into the bond on 1 August 1999, and been allowed to withdraw it after 12 months, he or she would now be \u00a3121 richer.

By the way, your property will need painting below the waterline every two years. </p> <p>Around 15,000 people live permanently on boats on waterways; they provide a choice of static or mobile accommodation for those who want an alternative to conventional housing for cost or lifestyle reasons. </p> <p>Although floating homes have never been more popular, they are not a new phenomenon. The British canal system was started 250 years ago and was made to accommodate boats measuring around seven feet wide - hence the name narrowboats. There are larger boats too, called houseboats or sometimes liveaboards; these are are usually found moored permanently on rivers, sometimes without engines. </p> <p>There are four key steps to joining the floating community. First, make sure it is the right option for you. A long narrowboat can be physically demanding - it often needs two people to tackle a lock, for example. </p> <p>On any houseboat there will be less room than in a conventional house, so you get to know people well - and remember that it is not easy to get away from them. </p> <p>Second, do you want to travel the country's 2,000 or so miles of waterways, or would you rather stay in one place? If you are determined to take your vessel through waterways around the country, you will need a boat suitable for negotiating the smallest canals. Living at a fixed mooring on, say, a river will normally allow you to have a larger vessel with better amenities. </p> <p>Third, make sure you know how to buy and maintain a boat. Most people start their life on the river with a second-hand boat from a brokerage firm based on a waterway - they can be found in Yellow Pages or via the internet. A second-hand boat could start from only \u00a315,000, although larger second-hand ones can cost as much as \u00a380,000. </p> <p>A recent internet advertisement asked \u00a350,000 for a 40ft x 20ft steel-hulled houseboat built in 1994, with wooden floors, a coal fire, gas-heated water, telephones, refrigerator, washing machine, TV and furniture. It's moored near Hampton Court Palace, where a one-bedroom flat would cost perhaps three or four times the price. </p> <p>You can sometimes get a boat through more orthodox estate agency routes. Winkworth is selling a newly decorated rare design one-bedroom boat moored on the canal near Eagle Wharf in north London for \u00a389,950. </p> <p>New boats start from \u00a330,000, ranging to \u00a3200,000 for a tailor-made high-specification vessel. You can get a mortgage for one, but interest rates are often double those for home loans because boats tend to depreciate and are more vulnerable to serious damage. </p> <p>Maintenance will of course depend on the boat's original condition - most require hull-painting at least once every two years, which involves removing them from the water. But this may cost little more than \u00a3500 in most cases. </p> <p>A newly introduced boat safety certificate is required for new vessels, and for different types of boats as they reach specified ages. Without a certificate you can't take the vessel on inland waterways, but you do not need one if you keep the vessel to tidal rivers or estuaries. </p> <p>Fourth, find yourself a mooring. If you are permanently living on a boat and want a fixed address, the mooring will be the largest annual running cost. A permanent mooring can cost up to \u00a34,000 a year in the most desirable locations, where there are likely to be good facilities such as running water or electricity; some long leases can set you back up to \u00a380,000, but they will in theory last up to 70 years. </p> <p>You can get a lot of facilities for your fee.

They extol the virtues of river-living, but stress that it may not suit the late riser. 'We do find we get woken at 6.30am by eights rowing on the river,' says Laws. </p> <p>His vessel costs about \u00a33,000 a year to run - the mooring and a navigation licence are the most expensive components. Unusually, it was built in 1985 as a fish and chip boat to work on waterways; it even has a serving hatch on the port side. </p> <p>The website answers frequently asked questions such as: 'Where does the used water go? and 'Isn't it cold in winter?' A more personal question is: 'Does the boat move when you make love?' (Answer 'Use your imagination.') </p> <p>He says one of the greatest challenges is controlling the boat. 'If there's no wind, it's very simple to steer forwards. But if it's windy, it can be very hard or even impossible to steer because the wind blows you off course.

      "body": "<p><strong> With Great Pleasure</strong> R4 </p> <p><strong> The Fix</strong> R5 </p> <p>Letter to Radio 4 from Disgusted, Glamis. 'We were not amused by the selection of music, poetry and prose in your <strong> With Great Pleasure </strong> series last Friday, purporting to reflect our enthusiasms and interest on the occasion of our 100th birthday. Peter Pan, Black Beauty, Edward Lear and No\u00ebl Coward bore the pants off us. A more realistic reflection of our tastes would have included readings from Tropic of Cancer and The Female Eunuch, poetry by Baudelaire and Pam Ayres and music by John Coltrane, Mahler and the Bay City Rollers. Furthermore, we have no recollection of Lady Longford being invited to Clarence House and asking for Bovril - what is Bovril?' </p> <p>Without the presence of the pleasuree, as presenter Ned Sherrin called her, there's not a lot of point in programmes such as With Great Pleasure. It's like Desert Island Discs without a castaway or an empty Psychiatrist's Chair. Besides, if Princess Margaret agreed to do Desert Island Discs, why shouldn't her game old bird of a mother do With Great Pleasure? Did anyone actually put it to her? I bet she'd have said yes. </p> <p>So why, you wonder, did this crusty old republican listen to the unbitter end? Because, in between the rhubarb, Sherrin talked to two royal biographers about the more personal aspects of the Queen Mother's life and that really was interesting. Lady Longford belongs to the old school of royalists, the kind prepared to argue that being bombed in a palace is the same as being bombed in a terrace in Mile End. Occasionally, her adulation went off the screen. </p> <p>Reflecting on the contribution the Queen Mother had made to twentieth-century life, Lady Longford made the following assertion: 'Her Scottish birth and upbringing, and even what might have seemed a disaster - the outbreak of the war - were all things that she used for the good of the country and the good of the world.' Work that one out. </p> <p>Grania Forbes, who got more scoops in her reign as PA's court correspondent than Mr Whippy, was mercifully less grandiloquent. Marrying into the royal family, she said, wasn't that much of a change for Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. She and her brother, David, referred to a bronze statue of a discus thrower in one of the family mansions as the running footman, a far more familiar species of manhood to their young eyes. </p> <p>As for 'Picture This', the poem commissioned for this tribute from the poet laureate himself, I have no quarrel with its patriotic sentiment, but surely, somewhere in his broad education, Andrew Motion must have cottoned on to the fact that Glamis rhymes with qualms and not with the first two syllables of palmistry. Poetic licence, I suppose, but maybe it was as well the Queen Mum wasn't there. </p> <p>I've always thought of Radio 5 as the healthy network, all those lean, tanned, toned presenters talking about sport, but <strong> The Fix</strong> focused frighteningly on the downside of exercise. Exercise addiction goes hand in hand, we learned, with anorexia nervosa and obsessive compulsive disorder. Presenter Kim Catcheside gave us some scary case histories. There was Charlotte, the casualty nurse who eats six Rice Krispies before she goes to work, comes home, eats six more Rice Krispies and then spends four hours exercising. No wonder she's in therapy. Is this, I wonder, a subtle move by Radio 5 to wean us slowly into the usual disappointment of watching British hopes die at the Olympics? </p> <p>The reasons our lads lose is not because they aren't fit, but they are so fit they've become addicts with psychological problems instead of athletes.</p>",

Peter Pan, Black Beauty, Edward Lear and No\u00ebl Coward bore the pants off us. A more realistic reflection of our tastes would have included readings from Tropic of Cancer and The Female Eunuch, poetry by Baudelaire and Pam Ayres and music by John Coltrane, Mahler and the Bay City Rollers. Furthermore, we have no recollection of Lady Longford being invited to Clarence House and asking for Bovril - what is Bovril?' Without the presence of the pleasuree, as presenter Ned Sherrin called her, there's not a lot of point in programmes such as With Great Pleasure. It's like Desert Island Discs without a castaway or an empty Psychiatrist's Chair. Besides, if Princess Margaret agreed to do Desert Island Discs, why shouldn't her game old bird of a mother do With Great Pleasure? Did anyone actually put it to her? I bet she'd have said yes. So why, you wonder, did this crusty old republican listen to the unbitter end? Because, in between the rhubarb, Sherrin talked to two royal biographers about the more personal aspects of the Queen Mother's life and that really was interesting. Lady Longford belongs to the old school of royalists, the kind prepared to argue that being bombed in a palace is the same as being bombed in a terrace in Mile End. Occasionally, her adulation went off the screen. Reflecting on the contribution the Queen Mother had made to twentieth-century life, Lady Longford made the following assertion: 'Her Scottish birth and upbringing, and even what might have seemed a disaster - the outbreak of the war - were all things that she used for the good of the country and the good of the world.' Work that one out. Grania Forbes, who got more scoops in her reign as PA's court correspondent than Mr Whippy, was mercifully less grandiloquent. Marrying into the royal family, she said, wasn't that much of a change for Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. She and her brother, David, referred to a bronze statue of a discus thrower in one of the family mansions as the running footman, a far more familiar species of manhood to their young eyes. As for 'Picture This', the poem commissioned for this tribute from the poet laureate himself, I have no quarrel with its patriotic sentiment, but surely, somewhere in his broad education, Andrew Motion must have cottoned on to the fact that Glamis rhymes with qualms and not with the first two syllables of palmistry. Poetic licence, I suppose, but maybe it was as well the Queen Mum wasn't there. I've always thought of Radio 5 as the healthy network, all those lean, tanned, toned presenters talking about sport, but The Fix focused frighteningly on the downside of exercise. Exercise addiction goes hand in hand, we learned, with anorexia nervosa and obsessive compulsive disorder. Presenter Kim Catcheside gave us some scary case histories. There was Charlotte, the casualty nurse who eats six Rice Krispies before she goes to work, comes home, eats six more Rice Krispies and then spends four hours exercising. No wonder she's in therapy. Is this, I wonder, a subtle move by Radio 5 to wean us slowly into the usual disappointment of watching British hopes die at the Olympics? The reasons our lads lose is not because they aren't fit, but they are so fit they've become addicts with psychological problems instead of athletes.",

Mallory had last been seen in 1924 on the summit ridge of the mountain, in what was his third and fatal attempt to reach the top. His clothes had been pulverised by seven decades of storms and high-altitude sunlight and lay in tatters around him, but the extreme cold had preserved his corpse. His back still undulated with muscle beneath skin that was bleached white. He looked 'like a marble statue'. </p> <p>In death as in life, for Mallory was a man of extraordinary physical beauty whose appearance provoked ecstatic comparisons with classical sculpture. 'Mon Dieu! George Mallory!' exclaimed Lytton Strachey after first seeing him in 1909. 'My hand trembles, my heart palpitates, my whole being swoons away at the words. He's six foot high, with the body of an athlete by Praxiteles and a face - oh incredible - the mystery of a Botticelli, the refinement and delicacy of a Chinese print, the youth and piquancy of an imaginable English boy.' </p> <p>The Gillmans begin their biography conventionally, with a rather tedious clamber around Mallory's family tree, and things only become interesting when Mallory goes up to Cambridge to read history in 1905. A.C. Benson, his tutor, was entranced. 'He is to be under me and I rejoice in the thought,' Benson confided ambiguously to his diary. The homoerotic atmosphere of Oxbridge had been thickening since the Wilde trial, and during Mallory's years there, Cambridge styled itself into a 'monde d'or of books, music and beautiful young men'. </p> <p>While an undergraduate, Mallory became romantically involved with various members of the Bloomsbury group, and the Gillmans have done a very good job in disentangling his liaisons. Lytton Strachey fell drastically in love with Mallory and Mallory fell in love with Lytton's brother, James. He also dallied with Duncan Grant, posing naked for him. 'I am profoundly interested in the nude me,' Mallory confessed in a letter to Grant. According to letters unearthed by the Gillmans, Mallory's sole homosexual experience was with James Strachey ('He insisted on copulating,' Strachey reported to Rupert Brooke) and in 1914 he met and married the luminously beautiful Ruth Turner. </p> <p>Mallory's only infidelity to Ruth was his fatal affair with Everest. The final expedition had about it a peculiarly British aura of aristocratic fastidiousness - the monogrammed handkerchiefs Mallory carried, the 60 tins of quail-in-foie-gras that were part of rations - and iron-willed resilience. The team climbed in the pre-monsoon weather window, but still faced the terrible depredations of altitude, jet winds, and temperatures down to -53 C. </p> <p>On 8 June 1924, Mallory and Andrew Irvine set off on the summit attempt. Another climber watched them 'moving expeditiously' along the ridge, until they were 'enveloped in cloud'. They did not return. Ruth Mallory was notified by telegram: 'Committee deeply regret receive bad news Everest expedition today. Your husband and Irvine killed last climb remainder returned safe.' For months afterwards, a friend recalled, she was like 'a stately lily with its head broken and hanging down'. </p> <p>The Gillmans have produced a respectful and thoroughly researched account of Mallory's life. However, they fail to answer the insistent question 'Why?' Why did Mallory leave his wife and family three times? Why did he become fatally obsessed with a lump of rock and ice? He was an idealist, they conclude, a romantic who believed 'there's no dream that mustn't be dared'. Well, yes, but that's not enough. Where did these ideals derive from; what is their deeper historical provenance? These are the questions that make Mallory so fascinating; sadly, they are skated over. </p> <p>Mallory's mythic status has been secured not only by his golden appearance, but also by his icy cenotaph. When Mallory climbed the mountain, it was the last bastion of unconquerable earth, the 'Third Pole'. It is now a tawdry tourist symbol, an elaborately frosted wedding-cake up which climbing companies annually yo-yo hundreds of under-experienced clients. Its slopes are studded with modern corpses.

American sociologist Mike Davis, author of the defining text on urban cultures, City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in LA , almost 10 years later turns his eye once again to his adopted hometown. His verdict is perhaps just as damning. </p> <p> Ecology of Fear examines the environmental and almost biblical damnation of Los Angeles - as borne out by plagues of insects, earthquakes and mass riots. The disasters are ready material for the Hollywood machine, and the author's assertion - that California seems hellbent on self-destruction - makes for alarming reading. </p> <p>Davis, currently teaching in upstate New York, has few competitors in this field. And Ecology of Fear is writ ten in an accessible style that distinguishes him from others - like Stanley Crouch, Henry Louis Gates, Jr and Stephen Gates - who similarly chronicle the American Age. In a chapter entitled 'The Literary Destruction of Los Angeles', he writes: 'Post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, overrun by terminators, androids and gangs, has become as much a clich\u00e9 as Marlowe's mean streets or Gidget's beach party. The decay of the city's old glamour has been inverted by the entertainment industry into a new glamour of decay.' </p> <p>In an age governed by the relatively free availability of information, Davis overturns mass propaganda to examine how LA, as a city, is racing towards some environmental otherworld. Dry sociology, wrung through the Davis information filter, is comparable to that other late, great commentator on Californian standards, John Steinbeck.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster Mike Davis pp484 , Verso \u00a37.99 Buy it at BOL 'California is the land of the fruits and the nuts' - an old East Coast saying. American sociologist Mike Davis, author of the defining text on urban cultures, City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in LA , almost 10 years later turns his eye once again to his adopted hometown. His verdict is perhaps just as damning. Ecology of Fear examines the environmental and almost biblical damnation of Los Angeles - as borne out by plagues of insects, earthquakes and mass riots. The disasters are ready material for the Hollywood machine, and the author's assertion - that California seems hellbent on self-destruction - makes for alarming reading. Davis, currently teaching in upstate New York, has few competitors in this field. And Ecology of Fear is writ ten in an accessible style that distinguishes him from others - like Stanley Crouch, Henry Louis Gates, Jr and Stephen Gates - who similarly chronicle the American Age. In a chapter entitled 'The Literary Destruction of Los Angeles', he writes: 'Post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, overrun by terminators, androids and gangs, has become as much a clich\u00e9 as Marlowe's mean streets or Gidget's beach party. The decay of the city's old glamour has been inverted by the entertainment industry into a new glamour of decay.' In an age governed by the relatively free availability of information, Davis overturns mass propaganda to examine how LA, as a city, is racing towards some environmental otherworld. Dry sociology, wrung through the Davis information filter, is comparable to that other late, great commentator on Californian standards, John Steinbeck.",

If Charles Lindbergh can be an ostrich and Hitler a dragon, if racism is a crow and the Reich a long dachshund, then what kind of allegory is the Cat, or the Sneetches or Horton or Yertle? </p> <p>Theodore Seuss Geisel, a Massachusetts boy from a German-American family, started drawing cartoons as a student at Dartmouth College in the 1920s. He had to publish them in the college magazine under his middle name because some smuggling of bootleg liquor had got him into trouble. The 'Dr' came from his later, brief flirtation with academia, when he did a postgraduate year at Oxford and took the opportunity to travel around Europe. He kept the title but never got the PhD. Back in New York, he published gag cartoons in humour magazines, and was hired by Esso oil company to draw its ads, including some for 'Flit' bug-spray which apparently made him quite famous. In 1937, he published his first children's story, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, but his interest in affairs in Europe meant he couldn't keep quiet about politics for long. </p> <p>Geisel was a Democrat, very much in favour of Roosevelt and furiously against fascism. He became associated with a now legendary left-wing newspaper called PM, a daily tabloid which pioneered the photographs of Weegee and published writing by James Thurber and Lillian Hellman. Their motto was: 'We are against people who push other people around.' Dr Seuss drew more than 400 cartoons for PM from 1941 to 1943, when he joined the US army and made propaganda films with moral messages as part of Frank Capra's Signal Corps unit. He won two Oscars for his documentaries. It wasn't until the 1950s that he made his name as a writer of children's books, but they won him a Pulitzer Prize and it remains the talent for which he is best known. The last sales count for The Cat in the Hat was 80 million, and that was in 1979. Geisel died in 1991. </p> <p>What's wonderful about the political cartoons is that although they are spiky in their satire, they work on the basic PM principle that people shouldn't be pushed around. So, instead of aggressive persuasion, we are presented with what looks like simple common sense. An early cartoon, for example, shows someone handing out 'ostrich bonnets', a sort of Dr Seuss version of a gas mask which is said to 'relieve Hitler headache'. People queue up eagerly, put on their ostrich head, and bend, all in a line, over little mounds of sand. The poster advertising the bonnets reads: 'Forget the terrible news you've read. Your mind's at ease with an ostrich head!' courtesy of 'Lindy Ostrich Service Inc'. </p> <p>The dig is at Charles Lindbergh, who promoted non-intervention in the war. Seuss devoted many of his best images to the 'isolationists' - pictures of Americans as complacent or dawdling. In a limerick more than worthy of the rhyming alphabetician he was to become, Seuss portrayed America (usually a Sneetch-like eagle or a bemused Uncle Sam, both wearing a Stars-and-Stripes version of the famous cat's hat) ignoring the war: 'Said a bird in the midst of a Blitz/ \"Up to now they've scored very few hits/ So I'll sit on my canny/ Old Star-Spangled Fanny\"/ And on it he sitz and he sitz.' </p> <p>Richard Minear, the author of Dr Seuss Goes to War, and Art Spiegelman, who wrote the introduction, think Dr Seuss's main problem is his portrayal of Hitler. Why? Because he is too funny. Hitler is very funny in these cartoons, it's true, but whether this is a strength or a weakness is arguable. In one image, he jumps back in his dining-chair, a horrified child, when he sees the British 'V for victory' sign in his alphabet soup. It makes him seem wonderfully pathetic. Perhaps the most virtuoso portrayal of Hitler is the one which provides the cover for the book. Entitled 'The Latest Self-Portrait', the cartoon depicts multiple f\u00fchrers. There is Hitler the sculptor at the base of his creation (and he was, as we know, a failed artist); there is 'Generalissimo Hitler', the hailing marble knight in armour; Hitler the moustachioed mermaid, a decoration on the pedestal, arm raised in salute; and there are twin Hitler cherubs, flying above and holding the conqueror's helmet in position. It's a perfect picture of megalomania, as if to say: 'When I rule the world, everyone will be just like me.' </p> <p>There are darker cartoons, such as one which shows Jews hanging from trees in a forest as Hitler and Vichy's Pierre Laval sing victoriously in the foreground. But I would argue that the images which make Hitler a buffoon are stronger, since those that come closer to the terrible reality can't actually come close enough. Fantasy has its own power and documents have theirs, but anything in between begins to look like a frivolous gesture. Geisel later said that he didn't 'deal in tragedies' and that 'without whimsy, none of us can live'. But he also felt that he had been 'intemperate, unhumorous in my attacks and I'd do it again'. His idiom was escapism, but his meaning was serious and clear. </p> <p>One of the cartoons in this book shows a mother (labelled 'America First', the non-interventionist organisation) reading a story called Adolf the Wolf to her children. The caption transcribes her jolly voice: 'and the Wolf chewed up the children and spit out their bonesbut those were Foreign Children and it really didn't matter.' The drawing raises questions about Dr Seuss's children's books and what, either by intention or in retrospect, they mean. Geisel did specify that Yertle the Turtle, the ill-fated despot, was meant to be Hitler, and that he'd originally given him a moustache but thought it a bit much. The Whos in Horton Hears a Who were inspired by the people of postwar Japan. </p> <p>But there are other characters whose message is obvious: the Sneetches with stars on their bellies and those without, who eventually come to terms with their differences; the demanding King Looie Katz who learns to hold his own tail up instead of making someone else do the job: they all end up more 'demo-catic'. It is as if, having fought for common sense during the war, Dr Seuss performed a canny shift and turned non-sense to his advantage, making it the plain universal language we needed to hear.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>That Was Satire That Was </strong> </p> <p>Humphrey Carpenter </p> <p>Victor Gollancz, \u00a320, pp384<br> Looking back on the satire boom, as if into ancient history, Brian Appleyard wrote two years ago that the very environment for satire had dried out. Both ideologies, of Left and Right, had failed to work; in the strange interim regency which is New Labour, nobody knew any more what would work. 'This is a loss that damps the satirical firepolitics has shrunk from matters of life and death to matters of presentation. Satire is in danger of shrinking with it.' </p> <p>But this thought, quoted by Humphrey Carpenter at the end of his book, is a bad misunderstanding. Satire never depended on faith in an alternative. Juvenal and Swift (the venerable satire twins, always trotted out by archdeacons of the BBC to legitimise their own failures of nerve), were not paid-up supporters of a Roman republican movement or of a Jacobite welfare state for Ireland. Instead, they saw the absurdity that attends all arrogance; they recognised that self-assured pomposity in a world of misery was hideously funny as well as evil. And they knew that uncontrollable laughter was as lethal as daggers. </p> <p>We have all that arrogance around us today, in abundance. An amazing BBC memo by Donald Baverstock in 1962, written as That Was The Week That Was approached its launch, observed that there was a need for prejudice, cynicism and indignation in times when the BBC was trying to make the viewers more and more earnest: 'Week in, week out, the public breathes, and we foster, a kind of philosophy of concern, goodwill and public-spiritedness on a massive scale' But isn't that fine-spun earnestness, that hypocritical cult of the correct, back with us again? Between the realism of Supermac and Tony Blair, an echo passes. </p> <p>What is missing is not a political climate for satire. It is a nursery or stud for satirists. Young men and women whose instinctive reaction to their world is sovereign, incredulous mockery occur in every generation - but they have yet to find their voice in this one. The most fascinating discovery in this compelling book is that it was the class system that spawned the whole satire boom. In the Sixties, people thought it odd that so many of the highly satirical stars - and not only at Private Eye - were public schoolboys, many of whom continued for years to vote Tory. But it was not odd at all. This was a long-overdue mutiny within the ruling middle class. </p> <p>If you live on the underside, squashed beneath a ludicrous propertied minority who congratulate you on your deference, satire is an endemic mood. Prudence keeps it mostly a private mood among consenting proles, but there are plenty of signs that the English common people have thought satirically for centuries. Their 'betters' churned out Victorian satires - mostly cartoons - lampooning Irish peasants, colonial blacks and 'the British working man', but seldom mocked themselves. </p> <p>It was not until the late Fifties (Suez, CND, Look Back In Anger ) that 'unthinking attitudes of respect' (Michael Frayn's phrase) collapsed into a sense of betrayal. Barriers began to fall; David Frost called them 'the traditional cordon sanitaire of sanctimony around public figures'. But as Carpenter points out, an equally important barrier was the screen between what could be said in private and in public. Alan Bennett told Carpenter: 'What was subsequently labelled \"satire\" was simply this kind of private humour going public.' </p> <p>Introducing TW3 in 1962, Ned Sherrin said that he was shy of the word satire: 'It's sort of adult chatit's simply the kind of thing one says to one's friends at a time like 11 o'clock on a Saturday night.' This was literally true. Beyond The Fringe and its progeny became possible when, at Oxford and Cambridge, the more risqu\u00e9 wit traditionally kept for the closed 'smokers' revues leaked out into open university stages such as the Footlights. </p> <p>Carpenter's book is really the tale of four institutions. Beyond The Fringe stunned the Edinburgh Festival in the summer of 1960. The Establishment opened its club doors in Greek Street and Private Eye launched its first issue almost simultaneously, a year later.

      "bodyText": "That Was Satire That Was Humphrey Carpenter Victor Gollancz, \u00a320, pp384 Looking back on the satire boom, as if into ancient history, Brian Appleyard wrote two years ago that the very environment for satire had dried out. Both ideologies, of Left and Right, had failed to work; in the strange interim regency which is New Labour, nobody knew any more what would work. 'This is a loss that damps the satirical firepolitics has shrunk from matters of life and death to matters of presentation. Satire is in danger of shrinking with it.' But this thought, quoted by Humphrey Carpenter at the end of his book, is a bad misunderstanding. Satire never depended on faith in an alternative. Juvenal and Swift (the venerable satire twins, always trotted out by archdeacons of the BBC to legitimise their own failures of nerve), were not paid-up supporters of a Roman republican movement or of a Jacobite welfare state for Ireland. Instead, they saw the absurdity that attends all arrogance; they recognised that self-assured pomposity in a world of misery was hideously funny as well as evil. And they knew that uncontrollable laughter was as lethal as daggers. We have all that arrogance around us today, in abundance. An amazing BBC memo by Donald Baverstock in 1962, written as That Was The Week That Was approached its launch, observed that there was a need for prejudice, cynicism and indignation in times when the BBC was trying to make the viewers more and more earnest: 'Week in, week out, the public breathes, and we foster, a kind of philosophy of concern, goodwill and public-spiritedness on a massive scale' But isn't that fine-spun earnestness, that hypocritical cult of the correct, back with us again? Between the realism of Supermac and Tony Blair, an echo passes. What is missing is not a political climate for satire. It is a nursery or stud for satirists. Young men and women whose instinctive reaction to their world is sovereign, incredulous mockery occur in every generation - but they have yet to find their voice in this one. The most fascinating discovery in this compelling book is that it was the class system that spawned the whole satire boom. In the Sixties, people thought it odd that so many of the highly satirical stars - and not only at Private Eye - were public schoolboys, many of whom continued for years to vote Tory. But it was not odd at all. This was a long-overdue mutiny within the ruling middle class. If you live on the underside, squashed beneath a ludicrous propertied minority who congratulate you on your deference, satire is an endemic mood. Prudence keeps it mostly a private mood among consenting proles, but there are plenty of signs that the English common people have thought satirically for centuries. Their 'betters' churned out Victorian satires - mostly cartoons - lampooning Irish peasants, colonial blacks and 'the British working man', but seldom mocked themselves. It was not until the late Fifties (Suez, CND, Look Back In Anger ) that 'unthinking attitudes of respect' (Michael Frayn's phrase) collapsed into a sense of betrayal. Barriers began to fall; David Frost called them 'the traditional cordon sanitaire of sanctimony around public figures'. But as Carpenter points out, an equally important barrier was the screen between what could be said in private and in public. Alan Bennett told Carpenter: 'What was subsequently labelled \"satire\" was simply this kind of private humour going public.' Introducing TW3 in 1962, Ned Sherrin said that he was shy of the word satire: 'It's sort of adult chatit's simply the kind of thing one says to one's friends at a time like 11 o'clock on a Saturday night.' This was literally true. Beyond The Fringe and its progeny became possible when, at Oxford and Cambridge, the more risqu\u00e9 wit traditionally kept for the closed 'smokers' revues leaked out into open university stages such as the Footlights. Carpenter's book is really the tale of four institutions. Beyond The Fringe stunned the Edinburgh Festival in the summer of 1960. The Establishment opened its club doors in Greek Street and Private Eye launched its first issue almost simultaneously, a year later. That Was The Week That Was dazzled its first Saturday night in November 1962, reached a peak of 12 million viewers and was finally strangled by the BBC at the end of 1963. Two years later, only Private Eye was still alive. As Carpenter realises, the birth of the satire boom is easier - and less important - to explain than its early death. When TW3 was near its end, Kenneth Adam (director of BBC Television) noted that 'audience and performers now form a kind of club, and there is no longer the same power to shock the initiates'. He was right: the key element distinguishing true satire from parodic wit is the power to bring the audience comic but appalling revelations about itself.

      "body": "<p><strong> Savage Garden</strong> Radio City Music Hall, New York </p> <p> We're talking about machismo and the modern male - haunted men, yelping with pain, towing bloody egos behind them. It's not a subject, I'm convinced, that a boy band member could elaborate on. Yet Darren Hayes, 28-year-old singer with Australian pop group Savage Garden, stirs opposite me. 'Y'know, men really are marginalised,' he says. 'And mostly it's their own fault.' </p> <p>I'm spellbound. The pre-pubescent market rarely sanctions social commentary by its poster boys. And, on the face of it, Savage Garden - with their sculpted cheekbones, teased hair and rouged lips - look perfectly gigglish. They make sparkly, lavishly decorated electronic records with nods to the mid-Eighties heyday of Eurythmics, Pet Shop Boys and Johnny Hates Jazz. Many of their songs sound like they could be played at an ice rink. </p> <p>In the UK, Savage Garden are still serving an apprenticeship at the hands of the teen press, regularly featuring only in magazines such as Smash Hits, Pop Hits and Sugar. Ranked alongside boy bands like N'Sync and The Backstreet Boys. The group have yet to transcend the poster-frieze, free cover bracelet audience group supported by pre-teens. </p> <p>Their US fanbase, however, includes both baby-boomers and the 'alt-rock' style conscious. The debut album Savage Garden sold more than 11 million copies worldwide, and their latest album, the love-as-concept piece Affirmation, was even reviewed in mainstream rock journals like Rolling Stone. </p> <p>Savage Garden's elevation to pop-anthem writers for the post-Woodstock generation is best viewed onstage. On the eve of our interview, at New York's ostentatious Radio City Music Hall, Hayes wears an orange sleeveless jacket and leather trousers and looks like an aspiring member of Man-O-War, the laughably homoerotic late-Eighties US metal group culled from a variety of New York gyms. 'New York, I love you. Sing with me,' he yells, squinting into the lights. </p> <p>The show has all the enjoyable aplomb of a big budget Las Vegas revue - dance routines change motif from boy band chic to S&amp;M, and finally a homage to Elvis Presley. As the group race through their hits - 'I Knew I Loved You', 'The Animal Song' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply' - two girl dancers compete for Hayes's attentions, periodically throwing themselves across the stage at him. </p> <p>Guitarist Daniel Jones throws out thrashy chords and effects-laden solos. He could almost be in Pearl Jam. His only contribution to the show's vaudeville revivalism is a worthy version of John Lennon's 'Imagine'. </p> <p>Behind me a chuckle of middle-aged women shuffle in high-heels, tanned forearms see-sawing through the air. One, dressed like a Mafia wife - white cardigan, black lipstick and an excess of blueberry rouge - stands on her seat. 'Whoo-op! Whoo-oop! Whoo-oop! Yeah, baby!' </p> <p>During one encore Hayes swaggers across stage, holding up his hands to the audience. 'Everyone do this,' he yells, his fingers making the shape of a heart. I once stage dived at a Glasgow Barrowlands concert by Seattle group Alice In Chains, and even crowd-surfed in the same venue during a set by the Ramones. Both ventures I now recollect as manly pursuits, the kind of off-duty activity that would make an Army sergeant proud. Now, compelled to hold up fingers cupped into a heart-shaped box, I feel strangely dislocated from my manhood. I mourn my loss of machismo, then raise the heart-shaped fingers again. </p> <p>At the interview Hayes laughs. 'What? You did that? And you blame me for it?' He sniggers politely from his side of the divan. He is dressed simply in a black T-shirt and pyjama bottoms. 'That's the whole point,' he says. 'Last night we had men in their fifties doing the exact same thing. It's amazing when you think about it - men are supposed to be out of touch with their emotions. Yet a few well-aimed songs can reduce them to that. I find that incredible.' </p> <p>Embarrassed at my admission, I fumble the theory that Savage Garden are the first postmodern, post-ironic boy band. And perhaps the only one distinguishable by their sizeable heterosexual male audience. Hayes stares back unblinkingly: 'I'm really being sincere when I do things like that,' he says. 'I mean the heart thing and \"Imagine\".' </p> <p>I laugh. Hayes leans over, whispering: 'What? You think I'm lying? I'm not being corny up there to poke fun at people. It's a big part of me - I want to spread good vibes. If I can touch people with my singing, then I've done my job.' He looks wounded, absent-mindedly running his fingers over his toes. </p> <p>That same night, further down Broadway, N'Sync are headlining at Madison Square Gardens. Their concert will be broadcast on pay-per-view TV. 'We're not trying for that urban market,' says Hayes. 'And I don't think anyone would take us seriously if we did. I think we're seen as a group that's too old for that - we're not kids any more. The groups that do that - well, it's a momentary thing, isn't it? Styles and fashions come and go - it's better to be true to what you are. That doesn't mean you can't change the show. I've never thought that Savage Garden should slavishly stick to one thing.' </p> <p>Hayes insists his group will evolve. 'We're deliberately trying to fuck with our audience and their perceptions. Ten years down the line we'll be making acoustic albums with a great back catalogue,' he promises. </p> <p>And by that time, buoyed by a fully mainstream audience, the group might have helped to end the awful, unaccountable fascination with the pre-teen buzz-bin. </p> <p> \u0095 Affirmation is out now on Columbia</p>",

      "bodyText": "Savage Garden Radio City Music Hall, New York We're talking about machismo and the modern male - haunted men, yelping with pain, towing bloody egos behind them. It's not a subject, I'm convinced, that a boy band member could elaborate on. Yet Darren Hayes, 28-year-old singer with Australian pop group Savage Garden, stirs opposite me. 'Y'know, men really are marginalised,' he says. 'And mostly it's their own fault.' I'm spellbound. The pre-pubescent market rarely sanctions social commentary by its poster boys. And, on the face of it, Savage Garden - with their sculpted cheekbones, teased hair and rouged lips - look perfectly gigglish. They make sparkly, lavishly decorated electronic records with nods to the mid-Eighties heyday of Eurythmics, Pet Shop Boys and Johnny Hates Jazz. Many of their songs sound like they could be played at an ice rink. In the UK, Savage Garden are still serving an apprenticeship at the hands of the teen press, regularly featuring only in magazines such as Smash Hits, Pop Hits and Sugar. Ranked alongside boy bands like N'Sync and The Backstreet Boys. The group have yet to transcend the poster-frieze, free cover bracelet audience group supported by pre-teens. Their US fanbase, however, includes both baby-boomers and the 'alt-rock' style conscious. The debut album Savage Garden sold more than 11 million copies worldwide, and their latest album, the love-as-concept piece Affirmation, was even reviewed in mainstream rock journals like Rolling Stone. Savage Garden's elevation to pop-anthem writers for the post-Woodstock generation is best viewed onstage. On the eve of our interview, at New York's ostentatious Radio City Music Hall, Hayes wears an orange sleeveless jacket and leather trousers and looks like an aspiring member of Man-O-War, the laughably homoerotic late-Eighties US metal group culled from a variety of New York gyms. 'New York, I love you. Sing with me,' he yells, squinting into the lights. The show has all the enjoyable aplomb of a big budget Las Vegas revue - dance routines change motif from boy band chic to S&amp;M, and finally a homage to Elvis Presley. As the group race through their hits - 'I Knew I Loved You', 'The Animal Song' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply' - two girl dancers compete for Hayes's attentions, periodically throwing themselves across the stage at him. Guitarist Daniel Jones throws out thrashy chords and effects-laden solos. He could almost be in Pearl Jam. His only contribution to the show's vaudeville revivalism is a worthy version of John Lennon's 'Imagine'. Behind me a chuckle of middle-aged women shuffle in high-heels, tanned forearms see-sawing through the air. One, dressed like a Mafia wife - white cardigan, black lipstick and an excess of blueberry rouge - stands on her seat. 'Whoo-op! Whoo-oop! Whoo-oop! Yeah, baby!' During one encore Hayes swaggers across stage, holding up his hands to the audience. 'Everyone do this,' he yells, his fingers making the shape of a heart. I once stage dived at a Glasgow Barrowlands concert by Seattle group Alice In Chains, and even crowd-surfed in the same venue during a set by the Ramones. Both ventures I now recollect as manly pursuits, the kind of off-duty activity that would make an Army sergeant proud. Now, compelled to hold up fingers cupped into a heart-shaped box, I feel strangely dislocated from my manhood. I mourn my loss of machismo, then raise the heart-shaped fingers again. At the interview Hayes laughs. 'What? You did that? And you blame me for it?' He sniggers politely from his side of the divan. He is dressed simply in a black T-shirt and pyjama bottoms. 'That's the whole point,' he says. 'Last night we had men in their fifties doing the exact same thing. It's amazing when you think about it - men are supposed to be out of touch with their emotions. Yet a few well-aimed songs can reduce them to that. I find that incredible.' Embarrassed at my admission, I fumble the theory that Savage Garden are the first postmodern, post-ironic boy band. And perhaps the only one distinguishable by their sizeable heterosexual male audience. Hayes stares back unblinkingly: 'I'm really being sincere when I do things like that,' he says. 'I mean the heart thing and \"Imagine\".' I laugh. Hayes leans over, whispering: 'What? You think I'm lying? I'm not being corny up there to poke fun at people. It's a big part of me - I want to spread good vibes. If I can touch people with my singing, then I've done my job.' He looks wounded, absent-mindedly running his fingers over his toes. That same night, further down Broadway, N'Sync are headlining at Madison Square Gardens. Their concert will be broadcast on pay-per-view TV. 'We're not trying for that urban market,' says Hayes. 'And I don't think anyone would take us seriously if we did. I think we're seen as a group that's too old for that - we're not kids any more. The groups that do that - well, it's a momentary thing, isn't it? Styles and fashions come and go - it's better to be true to what you are. That doesn't mean you can't change the show. I've never thought that Savage Garden should slavishly stick to one thing.' Hayes insists his group will evolve. 'We're deliberately trying to fuck with our audience and their perceptions. Ten years down the line we'll be making acoustic albums with a great back catalogue,' he promises. And by that time, buoyed by a fully mainstream audience, the group might have helped to end the awful, unaccountable fascination with the pre-teen buzz-bin. \u0095 Affirmation is out now on Columbia",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> BBC Proms </b> <br> Royal Albert Hall, London SW7/ Radio 3 <p>Whatever symphony is, Robin Holloway had assumed he would never write one. </p> <p>A big orchestral work in three or four movements is the simplest definition, though the form is capacious (and capricious) enough to allow as few as one or, in the case of Messiaen's Turangalila , as many as 10 if the mood takes you. All last century, the cry went up that the symphony was dead. Composers doggedly kept writing them, none the less - Vaughan Williams (nine), Shostakovich (15) and more recently a handful from Peter Maxwell Davies and Hans Werner Henze. The real protest was against fossilised procedures in form and strategy. Now music has no rules, except to reject precedents. </p> <p>Responding to a Proms commission, Holloway (b.1943) has allowed himself, in his own words, to be 'tugged through a hedge backwards' in order to do the unthinkable. The result is a work for huge orchestra of visionary grandeur and bold ambition called Symphony. Its three parts, growing out of the musical seeds of the first few bars, depict the course of the twentieth century, roughly summed up as pre-war opulence, wartime madness and cold-war alienation, this last pitting the orchestra against itself in bleak opposition. </p> <p>Holloway also imagined each section to represent colour: purple, yellow/ orange and ice blue/ green. Some have objected to this apparently literal scena, arguing that music shouldn't need the sort of verbal explanations and qualifications which the composer has amply provided in a programme note. </p> <p>On those grounds, you may as well dismiss Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique (lovesick poet takes poison), Strauss's Symphonia Domestica (making baby, bathing baby etc) or even Beethoven's 'Pastoral' symphony. For the listener, anyway, the narrative is only a suggestive starting point, not a bar-by-bar plot. So, too, with this new work, which received its premiere in an heroic performance - given the scale, density and intricacy of the score - by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Donald Runnicles. The music has its own eloquence, with or without the storyline. </p> <p>As so often in Holloway's oeuvre, musical quotations abound, perhaps too overtly at times in the first movement, with Elgar, especially, never far away. Yet the focus of the piece, the angry, bilious second movement scherzo, is surely his finest achievement to date. After a jazzy, scene-setting opening, it builds up from a desiccated flutter of strings to a great, frenzied climax of terror in which the orchestra is constantly divided and subdivided to achieve more layers of sound. The effect is of a few moths flickering around a light bulb metamorphosing into an all-eclipsing flock of crows. </p> <p>Holloway's mastery of the orchestra is astonishing in its detail and assurance. The work ends after an hour on a question mark, a composite chord which could lead on but simply and wisely stops. Several more hearings are needed to appraise the compelling piece fully. Runnicles also conducted a pacy account of Act 3 of Wagner's Die Walk\u00fcre , in which Christine Brewer excelled as a potent, richly expressive Brunnhilde, with James Morris an unusually elegant, light-toned Wotan. </p> <p>Another new work, Jonathan Harvey's Mothers Shall Not Cry (2000), dazzlingly exploited the acoustic possibilities of the Albert Hall, tossing sounds around electronically and humanly from all sides of the building, high and low, so that this 'millennium cantata' (again, imaginative Proms commissioning) had listeners cocking their heads to see the sound. Like Holloway, Harvey tackled humanitarian issues, in this case the disappeared and all those, especially women, who have suffered in war and civil strife, their litany of names announced (by the women of the BBC Singers and New London Chamber Choir) until they become 'a whirlpool formed of all humanity's woes'. </p> <p>Soprano Susannah Glanville took on the role of archetypal female Wisdom - Sophia, Mary, mother - with shining conviction. Only a composer of Harvey's integrity could handle this multicultural concoction, from Buddhism to Christianity, the Holocaust and Kosovo, without the whole event collapsing into a slo gan-shouting travesty. His gift is to make the listener, too, aspire to the higher matters which so preoccupy him by writing music of commitment and beauty. </p> <p>Joshua Bell and Steven Isserlis were expressive soloists in a sinewy account of Brahms's Double Concerto for Violin and Cello. This BBCSO programme, conducted by Jac van Steen, was framed by two Bach preludes and fugues, one played by Martin Neary on the wheezy (soon to be restored) Albert Hall organ, one (the 'St Anne') in Schoenberg's revelatory, marionette-like orchestration. </p> <p>Bach fared less well at the hands of Ton Koopman, a veteran scholar and interpreter, who has burnt his fingers in an attempt to reconstruct one of the master's lost works, the St Mark Passion, of which only the libretto survives. Call me old-fashioned, but why bother? Bach's enormous surviving output would take an average listener several lifetimes to assimilate.

      "bodyText": "BBC Proms Royal Albert Hall, London SW7/ Radio 3 Whatever symphony is, Robin Holloway had assumed he would never write one. A big orchestral work in three or four movements is the simplest definition, though the form is capacious (and capricious) enough to allow as few as one or, in the case of Messiaen's Turangalila , as many as 10 if the mood takes you. All last century, the cry went up that the symphony was dead. Composers doggedly kept writing them, none the less - Vaughan Williams (nine), Shostakovich (15) and more recently a handful from Peter Maxwell Davies and Hans Werner Henze. The real protest was against fossilised procedures in form and strategy. Now music has no rules, except to reject precedents. Responding to a Proms commission, Holloway (b.1943) has allowed himself, in his own words, to be 'tugged through a hedge backwards' in order to do the unthinkable. The result is a work for huge orchestra of visionary grandeur and bold ambition called Symphony. Its three parts, growing out of the musical seeds of the first few bars, depict the course of the twentieth century, roughly summed up as pre-war opulence, wartime madness and cold-war alienation, this last pitting the orchestra against itself in bleak opposition. Holloway also imagined each section to represent colour: purple, yellow/ orange and ice blue/ green. Some have objected to this apparently literal scena, arguing that music shouldn't need the sort of verbal explanations and qualifications which the composer has amply provided in a programme note. On those grounds, you may as well dismiss Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique (lovesick poet takes poison), Strauss's Symphonia Domestica (making baby, bathing baby etc) or even Beethoven's 'Pastoral' symphony. For the listener, anyway, the narrative is only a suggestive starting point, not a bar-by-bar plot. So, too, with this new work, which received its premiere in an heroic performance - given the scale, density and intricacy of the score - by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Donald Runnicles. The music has its own eloquence, with or without the storyline. As so often in Holloway's oeuvre, musical quotations abound, perhaps too overtly at times in the first movement, with Elgar, especially, never far away. Yet the focus of the piece, the angry, bilious second movement scherzo, is surely his finest achievement to date. After a jazzy, scene-setting opening, it builds up from a desiccated flutter of strings to a great, frenzied climax of terror in which the orchestra is constantly divided and subdivided to achieve more layers of sound. The effect is of a few moths flickering around a light bulb metamorphosing into an all-eclipsing flock of crows. Holloway's mastery of the orchestra is astonishing in its detail and assurance. The work ends after an hour on a question mark, a composite chord which could lead on but simply and wisely stops. Several more hearings are needed to appraise the compelling piece fully. Runnicles also conducted a pacy account of Act 3 of Wagner's Die Walk\u00fcre , in which Christine Brewer excelled as a potent, richly expressive Brunnhilde, with James Morris an unusually elegant, light-toned Wotan. Another new work, Jonathan Harvey's Mothers Shall Not Cry (2000), dazzlingly exploited the acoustic possibilities of the Albert Hall, tossing sounds around electronically and humanly from all sides of the building, high and low, so that this 'millennium cantata' (again, imaginative Proms commissioning) had listeners cocking their heads to see the sound. Like Holloway, Harvey tackled humanitarian issues, in this case the disappeared and all those, especially women, who have suffered in war and civil strife, their litany of names announced (by the women of the BBC Singers and New London Chamber Choir) until they become 'a whirlpool formed of all humanity's woes'. Soprano Susannah Glanville took on the role of archetypal female Wisdom - Sophia, Mary, mother - with shining conviction. Only a composer of Harvey's integrity could handle this multicultural concoction, from Buddhism to Christianity, the Holocaust and Kosovo, without the whole event collapsing into a slo gan-shouting travesty. His gift is to make the listener, too, aspire to the higher matters which so preoccupy him by writing music of commitment and beauty. Joshua Bell and Steven Isserlis were expressive soloists in a sinewy account of Brahms's Double Concerto for Violin and Cello. This BBCSO programme, conducted by Jac van Steen, was framed by two Bach preludes and fugues, one played by Martin Neary on the wheezy (soon to be restored) Albert Hall organ, one (the 'St Anne') in Schoenberg's revelatory, marionette-like orchestration. Bach fared less well at the hands of Ton Koopman, a veteran scholar and interpreter, who has burnt his fingers in an attempt to reconstruct one of the master's lost works, the St Mark Passion, of which only the libretto survives. Call me old-fashioned, but why bother? Bach's enormous surviving output would take an average listener several lifetimes to assimilate. Koopman has composed new recitatives and stitched together music from elsewhere in Bach's output for the remainder. The whole is about as close to Bach as a cobbled together frock is to a Dior original. Koopman has described how he found himself using several notes where he knew Bach would only have needed two, a lesson in itself. He defended the enterprise as providing a sequence of 'beautiful music'. That was the problem. Aria, chorus, recitative followed in pallid succession. Bach is an architect, not a compiler. Ingredients are not recipes. The Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra and soloists did their best to look cheerful, but the audience was glum. My neighbour was engrossed in Rosemary Conley's Complete Hip and Thigh Diet Book throughout. A cork popped, mid-chorale, somewhere among the promenaders. They were well advised. Flesh and fizz were singularly lacking on stage.",

Eventually, in an melodramatic finale worthy of D.W.

There is something beatific about the boy, but there's no trace of sentimentality or sanctimoniousness in the way he's presented. We enter his world, experiencing his joys and pains, his delight in nature, his love for his grandmother, his wish to be treated like a normal member of the community. </p> <p>There are scenes in this picture that etch themselves into the spectator's brain. In the bus going home, Mohammed holds his hand outside the window: 'I want to catch he wind.' he says.

He touches his little sister's face, telling her she's growing up. </p> <p>Visiting the village school he astonishes the pupils by reading with absolute fluency the Braille text of the same primer they've been stumbling over and they gather round him in wonder. He listens to the woodpeckers and tries to work out their tapping as a form of code, analogous to Braille. </p> <p>With this film coming so soon after the Cannes screening of the the 20-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards, there can be no doubting that another formidable generation of Iranian filmmakers is emerging, and that they have a peculiar sensitivity to the young and vulnerable.</p>",

He takes his grandma's hand, telling her that the skin she thinks calloused by hard work is beautiful - 'Your hands are white.' He touches his little sister's face, telling her she's growing up. Visiting the village school he astonishes the pupils by reading with absolute fluency the Braille text of the same primer they've been stumbling over and they gather round him in wonder. He listens to the woodpeckers and tries to work out their tapping as a form of code, analogous to Braille. With this film coming so soon after the Cannes screening of the the 20-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards, there can be no doubting that another formidable generation of Iranian filmmakers is emerging, and that they have a peculiar sensitivity to the young and vulnerable.",

People queued to get into them, then they fell into disrepair. There is one of Versailles in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and about 37 extant, in North Korea, Egypt, Australia (by Henk Guth, in Alice Springs) and a couple in museums in this country. They belong to that category of beguiling things which includes mirrors, shadows, masks, Arcimboldo's faces of fruit and veg, optical illusions: the maze also falls into this group. </p> <p>One of the oldest mazes is on a rock carving in Sardinia (c2000 BC) and the oldest surviving hedge maze is the Hampton Court maze of 1690. The maze has had several vogues and one is now. This is to do with the leisure and travel industry; it is something to do when you arrive. The leading maze designer, Adrian Fisher, has in the last 16 years designed 300, in traditional yew and many other materials, and this year he has made 18 mazes in cornfields. Fisher has been fascinated by mazes since he was a small boy and he built his first maze in his father's Dorset garden. </p> <p>In the first mazes, you traced the route with your eye and finger on a tablet from Greece (c1500 BC), on a Syrian ceramic vessel (c1300 BC), in south India 1000 BC), in Arizona (AD 1100-1200), or in Ireland (AD 550). The next development was when they were made of stones lying on the ground in Sweden in the eighth century and you could walk round them. These first images symbolically lead us to the centre of things, whatever that was. It could be nirvana, impregnation, or maturity, depending on your culture. </p> <p>The next development in mazes came in the Renaissance when as part of garden design they were made from hedges and you could walk round in them and get lost. Inspired probably by the myth of Theseus and the minotaur - the minotaur lived in a labyrinth at Knossos in Crete and Theseus went to kill him, helped to escape by Ariadne's gift of a golden thread to enable him to retrace his steps - these modern mazes enable us to experience choice and disorientation. It is only with the modern hedge maze - then the mirror maze, and the maze which changes after you get into it - that the participant is faced with real, not symbolic, choices. </p> <p>The maze is based on that terrible feeling we sometimes have of being lost. When you still get that sensation, in an airport, an unfamiliar district, or the changing room at a new gym, we regress to being a frightened child. I have been in the Hampton Court maze twice, and each time I was a bit spooked. I was relieved to get out. My other experience of a maze was to drive to the little one at Dalby in the Yorkshire Wolds (O.S. Ref SE 625719). It is delightful to come upon this piece of mysterious graphic culture at the side of the road in the green desert of this countryside. This one may come from the Norse invaders. </p> <p>Perhaps the graphic image of the maze is based on a series of labyrinthine caves that were naturally formed, a geometric formalisation of a natural confusion. The graphic maze is superficially symmetrical, but on close inspection it is not, because a unique line traverses it. It is related to the spiral, the swastika and knotwork. There is a moving contrast between a cheaply printed maze in a child's book, and the earnest wandering line of the little person's crayon as they try to find their way out. </p> <p>This 'going for a walk with a line' that Paul Klee devoted his career to is a marvellous part of maze-making. Most of Klee's work invites us to follow a line around obstacles, to see or be a line turning back on itself, obeying arbitrary rules like not crossing where we have been before, and generally leading us a merry, confusing dance. Klee's follower, the brilliant graphic artist Saul Steinberg, published The Labyrinth in 1960. Steinberg's wonderful ability to visualise the verbal, to represent fear, and loss, and pomposity, and sweetness, in the labyrinthine and hugely varied visual remarks that come out of his characters' mouths, bring the maze shape to hilarious life. </p> <p>It is often difficult to find one's way. As we search life's byways we are continually faced with decisions - should we go out, should we stay in, should we ring up, or are we too tired. In a hedge maze you can get a terrible sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the feeling that you have been in this corner before. </p> <p>The maze is like a spiral with choices, a rule about a line that should not cross itself but be as long as possible. In a spiral there is an inevitable drawing in, and the maze has that, but with many decisions to be made as well. In some flat mazes you walk on the walls, in some in the alleys. They are lovely cut green hedges in the sun and mysterious in the shade - very good for middlebrow TV series like The Avengers and The Prisoner. A maze looks like a brain; it is as if you have to negotiate the pathways of a brain using your own. It is degrading that in modern times one of the meanings of the maze has been of rats running them to prove that we learn from experience impelled by reward. </p> <p>Recently Adrian Fisher and other maze designers have begun to make their mazes pictures. I am usually a fan of the figurative, but I have my doubts. This summer Fisher has designed the world's largest maze - so far - in a field of maize at Tulleys Farm, near Crawley in Sussex. It is shaped like a castle if seen from above. Fisher has also made one in the shape of a mother and baby elephant at Woburn Safari Park. But we do not usually see mazes from above. The experience of being in a maze is to be confronted by lots of similar stuff and not knowing which way to turn. It is more Kafka than Beatrix Potter. It may amuse the designers to make mazes like feet or locomotives or dragons but it is not central to the experience. It is gilding the lily. </p> <p> Patrick Hughes is a painter - many of his early pictures featured odd perspectives and visual paradoxes and today most are three-dimensional in nature.

      "body": "<p>Harrison Ford is wearily fielding questions from the audience on Jay Leno's Tonight Show about how, er, um, as a, er, man , he, er, handles love scenes with - corrrr!!! - Michelle Pfeiffer. Patiently, he explains that such scenes are filmed in the presence of almost as many people as there are in the studio audience, so there is not really a problem of that kind. Then someone wants to know just how does he get his hair to stand up in that nice fluffy way? You can almost see at the back of his mind the question forming: who are these guys? But he battles on, a pro to the last, a man who has flown his own plane down from Wyoming in order to talk about What Lies Beneath, the new mystery thriller in which he stars with Ms Pfeiffer. </p> <p>He is doing what needs must be done and is often written heavily into an actor's contract: taking part in one of the many obligatory interviews at the time a film is launched in order to ensure that the public knows about the product. Later this month, Ford will be again answering - he must hope - slightly more intelligent questions at the Venice Film Festival, but tonight in Los Angeles he is doing his bit for DreamWorks SKG, for this is a DreamWorks production and every effort has to be made to drive the film high in the box-office returns hit parade that is studied in the city with the same obsession as football results in Manchester on a wet Saturday evening. </p> <p>Whether any of the triumvirate who launched DreamWorks six years ago will have noted Ford's performance is unlikely; there are other games to play in town tonight. But if they catch sight of him on a flickering television in a hotel lobby, it could only give them further confirmation that, finally, a large part of the DreamWorks dream is coming true. </p> <p>In its first 10 days, What Lies Beneath took $70 million at the US box office, and is tucked in at number two for the best weekend takings behind Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor II: The Klumps. DreamWorks features again at number nine with Chicken Run ($93m in box-office returns), number 14 with Gladiator ($180m), number 32 with Road Trip ($67m), and at number 44, with a bullet, you might say, is Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks ($17m). Pick the bones out of that and there is quite a meaty studio. </p> <p>All this comes in the wake of the five Oscars won by DreamWorks' American Beauty in March, so it is hardly surprising that the industry's bible, Variety, is claiming that 'DreamWorks truly has arrived' and that even greater dominance will follow. </p> <p>DreamWorks SKG was founded in 1994 by what was - still is - probably the most powerful threesome in the entertainment business (SKG is the initials of their respective surnames). There was Steven Spielberg, already garlanded with his successes as director of ET, Back to the Future, Jaws, Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park; Jeffrey Katzenberg, the former chairman and chief executive of Walt Disney studios, credited with rescuing the studio from the doldrums at the time when Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Pretty Woman and The Lion King were being made; and David Geffen, a legendary figure in the music business as the founder of Geffen Records in 1980, but someone with his own track record in the film business as a producer of Personal Best, After Hours and Beetlejuice. How could they fail? </p> <p>Hollywood, which had been shocked and puzzled by Katzenberg's departure from Disney, waited and watched, uncertain whether the three men would amount to less than the sum of their parts. All have had personal problems in the past year. Katzenberg was involved in a lengthy and unedifying court battle with Disney over what he was still owed by them. He eventually accepted a pay-off of $275m, though said that the settlement was 'mostly about putting closure on a chapter of my life'. Geffen found himself the subject of the kind of publicity he did not seek when a biography on which he had originally cooperated showed him in a less than flattering light. And in February, Spielberg, now 52, had a kidney removed after doctors spotted an irregularity during a check-up. While he was subsequently proclaimed fighting fit, the news inevitably caused flutters. </p> <p>Then last summer there was the fiasco over the new DreamWorks studios which should, at this very moment, be under construction on the wetlands just north of Los Angeles airport. The deal seemed done for what would have been California's first major studio to be built since the Depression when suddenly DreamWorks pulled out, sending tremors through the film industry. Did this mean that DreamWorks were unsure of the future? What had made them change their mind? Katzenberg's cryptic statement at the time - 'the move was simply not meant to be' - did not clarify anything. </p> <p>The construction of the studio had become the subject of fierce opposition from environmentalists who saw the wetlands as irreplaceable, and portrayed Spielberg and Co as 'DreamJerks' for even thinking about building in such a sensitive area. But fears that the collapse of the studio plan signified problems on the film front have turned out to be built on foundations as unsteady as the wetlands themselves. </p> <p>So there will be 11 DreamWorks films released this year (last year it was six). Upcoming launches for which there are high hopes include The Legend of Bagger Vance - Robert Redford's film about a mystical golf caddy, starring Will Smith, Matt Damon and Charlize Theron; and Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous, with Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup and Frances McDormand. </p> <p>But what is the magic ingredient and why did it take so long to find? One industry theory, expounded by Paul Duke of Variety, is that DreamWorks was spreading itself too thin at first, even entering the market for computer games. Now that it has shed some of the sideshows, it is able to concentrate on what it does best: making and nurturing films. But equally, DreamWorks has been the beneficiary of a new boom for films that are either from the independent sector or have an independent feel to them like American Beauty and Road Trip. They have been able to bring the big studio publicity values to small studio ideals. Thus Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks enjoyed the sort of high mainstream profile that his films rarely get because DreamWorks decided to promote it aggressively across the US. </p> <p>DreamWorks has also benefited from its image. Although it is run by some of the wealthiest men in the world, it has been able to retain its image of being the little guy against the big studio bullies. This is attractive to many of the more creative talents working in film at the moment who are weary of studio pressures to produce formulaic material. DreamWorks offers these filmmakers the best of both worlds: freedom to operate, and the sort of financial deal that the real independent world can only, well, dream of. </p> <p>Not that DreamWorks' dreams have come true on all fronts. When it first announced its arrival in 1994, DreamWorks made it clear that it hoped to enter all the major entertainment fields, but its record outside film is patchy. On the television side, DreamWorks has scored its most notable hit with Spin City which was launched in 1996 and starred Michael J. Fox. But Fox bowed out of the series - in an emotional farewell screened this summer - when Parkinson's Disease made the heavy production schedule impossible to meet. Spin City has been a highly profitable operation for DreamWorks, generating between $2.5m and $3m an episode and cushioning other less successful TV ventures. </p> <p>It was feared that the departure of Fox, who was popular not only with viewers but also with programme-makers, might scupper this success, although Charlie Sheen has been signed as a replacement. Fox's farewell show was a ratings topper which had hardened newscasters wiping away tears as they reported on it. Fox will return to a different, less demanding schedule with a comedy being assembled by former Seinfeld scriptwriters, Alec Berg and Jeff Schaffer. </p> <p> Spin City is something of a lone triumph. Ink , which starred Ted Danson and was also launched in 1996, was not a success. Freaks and Geeks was fun and original but did not find the elusive large audience that DreamWorks had sought, and The Others, which tried to attract the X Files generation, was similarly unsuccessful. </p> <p>DreamWorks Records, meanwhile, has had recent success with Papa Roach's hip-hop album Infest, but they have had only two million-sellers: George Michael's Older and Tonight the Stars Revolt! by Powerman 6000. Considering the track record of Geffen as a hit-maker, the successes might seem slimmer than expected. </p> <p>What has been less impressive is <a href=\"http://www.pop.com\"> Pop.com</a>, the internet site launched last year by Spielberg and Katzenberg as an online entertainment site. Based in Glendale, and employing 90 people, Pop.com has not exactly fulfilled its promise and the Los Angeles Times reported this week that that its founders were hunting for a merger partner, quoting one executive as saying 'they would love for the crowd to look left and to be able to exit stage right'. Pop.com was a three-way venture which also involved Imagine Entertainment and Vulcan ventures which was set up by Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen. Katzenberg virtually suggested that it could be the next MTV and Spielberg said that he would be contributing to its output. Its future looks uncertain. </p> <p>The DreamWorks logo shows a small boy fishing on a crescent moon. The dream team may have come up with a few crabs in their six years, but for the time being at least, they do not have to talk about the one that got away. </p> <p> What Lies Beneath opens here in October</p>",

It's as tight a form as a haiku or a Petrarchan sonnet. </p> <p>As with all Jerry Bruckheimer productions, Dominic Sena's heist movie, <strong> Gone in 60 Seconds</strong>, is packed with stars, rarely pauses to think, throbs to electronic music and is the dramatic equivalent of a destruction derby. </p> <p>Nicolas Cage is California's greatest car thief who's brought out of rural retirement to steal 50 special cars in 48 hours for a Latin American client. If he fails, his younger brother (Giovanni Ribisi) will be killed by the most vicious criminal in Los Angeles, an Englishman with a Liverpool accent (Christopher Ecclestone) known as 'the Carpenter' because of his hobby of restoring antique furniture. </p> <p>So Cage recruits a gang that includes Robert Duvall as the obligatory old-timer and Vinnie Jones as a mute morgue attendant known as 'the Sphinx'. He plans a meticulous robbery and crosses swords along the way with a car-theft policeman (Delroy Lindo) who's been trying to nail him for years. </p> <p>An expensive remake of a 1974 low-budget thriller that never crossed the Atlantic, Gone in 60 Seconds is, in fact, a pretty typical caper movie, though for all its testosterone and macho-posturing it ends up more like a capon movie. </p> <p>The characters are thin and less endearing than their creators think. They take second place to the expensive sports cars and customised classics they're stealing. When Angeline Jolie, the only girl in the mob, asks Cage: 'What do you think is more exciting - having sex or stealing cars?', the brilliantly witty answer is: 'Having sex while stealing cars.' </p> <p>Nothing is morally at stake and while much destruction and inconvenience is caused to the citizens of Long Beach, the only people to get hurt are a few villains. As it happens, no one could care either way about the fate of Ecclestone's 'Carpenter', who's about as frightening as the unmasked Wizard of Oz. The only thing I learnt from this picture is that the professional car thief's preferred euphemism for his craft is 'boosting'. </p> <p>Remotely inspired by an actual incident, Patrice Leconte's <strong> La Veuve de Saint-Pierre</strong> is a staid costume movie that lacks the wit, bite and panache of his earlier historical piece, Ridicule. The setting is the remote, austere French colony of St Pierre off the coast of Newfoundland, where, in 1849, two fishermen kill the skipper of their boat for no ascertainable reason while on a drunken binge. </p> <p>One is sentenced to be transported, but is accidentally killed minutes after the trial. The other, Neel (Yugoslav director Emir Kusturica), is sentenced to be executed. But because there's no guillotine on the island, he becomes the responsibility of the captain of the local garrison (Daniel Auteuil) until one arrives from Martinique. </p> <p>While remaining an enigmatic figure, the hulking, illiterate Neel undergoes a moral transformation as a result of the sympathetic attentions of the captain's beautiful, free-thinking wife (Juliette Binoche). He mends roofs, grows flowers in a greenhouse, saves a woman's life, marries a girl he makes pregnant. </p> <p>Neel is a different man, so should he still be executed? A dispute grows up between the rigid merchants, civil servants and their families on one hand, and the captain, his wife and the common folk on the other, a conflict that threatens the captain with the charge of sedition. </p> <p>The authentic look of the film is more convincing than the behaviour and period psychology. I can't believe that the genteel wife of a judge would say to her friends about the killer: 'He cuckolds our men without screwing us.' And would the working-class populace be so easily won over by a brutal killer? </p> <p>I found La Veuve de Saint-Pierre much less interesting than another true story of a nineteenth-century jailer's wife becoming involved with a condemned man, Gillian Armstrong's Mrs Stoffel. </p> <p>As the title suggests, the latest DreamWorks animated movie, <strong> The Road to El Dorado</strong>, is a cartoon version of a Bing Crosby and Bob Hope comedy set in the early sixteenth century and directed by ex-Disney hand Don Paul, who co-headed the visual-effects department on The Prince of Egypt. </p> <p>Two Spanish conmen, Tulio and Miguel, voiced by and visually resembling Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh, become accidental stowaways on Cort\u00e9s's galleon and end up in Latin America with a map of El Dorado won in a craps game. </p> <p>They're mistaken for gods by a high priest and tribal chief, and they team up with a Dorothy Lamour figure, the dusky maiden Chel (Rosie Perez), to escape with a boatload of gold. </p> <p>No one would dare make a 1940s-style Road to comedy today with jokes about superstitious natives being gulled by crooked Westerners. You can still get away with it in an animated movie and the opening scenes of The Road to El Dorado are fairly amusing. But laughter is in increasingly short supply as the film proceeds and Miguel sets aside the Hope-Crosby cynicism to take a principled stand against human sacrifice and colonial exploitation. </p> <p>What isn't in short supply, unfortunately, are songs by Elton John and Tim Rice. Did I really hear the couplet 'I don't think I'm qualified/ To come on all sanctified'? Can the song 'Friends Never Say Goodbye' have no words apart from its title, which Elton John endlessly repeats, sometimes dropping the word 'friends'? </p> <p>The lyrics, with their non-sequiturs and gnomic observations, sound as if they've resulted from a party game modelled on Consequences in which you write a line then pass the paper on to the new player with only the last word showing to get the rhyme.</p>",

While remaining an enigmatic figure, the hulking, illiterate Neel undergoes a moral transformation as a result of the sympathetic attentions of the captain's beautiful, free-thinking wife (Juliette Binoche). He mends roofs, grows flowers in a greenhouse, saves a woman's life, marries a girl he makes pregnant. Neel is a different man, so should he still be executed? A dispute grows up between the rigid merchants, civil servants and their families on one hand, and the captain, his wife and the common folk on the other, a conflict that threatens the captain with the charge of sedition. The authentic look of the film is more convincing than the behaviour and period psychology. I can't believe that the genteel wife of a judge would say to her friends about the killer: 'He cuckolds our men without screwing us.' And would the working-class populace be so easily won over by a brutal killer? I found La Veuve de Saint-Pierre much less interesting than another true story of a nineteenth-century jailer's wife becoming involved with a condemned man, Gillian Armstrong's Mrs Stoffel. As the title suggests, the latest DreamWorks animated movie, The Road to El Dorado, is a cartoon version of a Bing Crosby and Bob Hope comedy set in the early sixteenth century and directed by ex-Disney hand Don Paul, who co-headed the visual-effects department on The Prince of Egypt. Two Spanish conmen, Tulio and Miguel, voiced by and visually resembling Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh, become accidental stowaways on Cort\u00e9s's galleon and end up in Latin America with a map of El Dorado won in a craps game. They're mistaken for gods by a high priest and tribal chief, and they team up with a Dorothy Lamour figure, the dusky maiden Chel (Rosie Perez), to escape with a boatload of gold. No one would dare make a 1940s-style Road to comedy today with jokes about superstitious natives being gulled by crooked Westerners. You can still get away with it in an animated movie and the opening scenes of The Road to El Dorado are fairly amusing. But laughter is in increasingly short supply as the film proceeds and Miguel sets aside the Hope-Crosby cynicism to take a principled stand against human sacrifice and colonial exploitation. What isn't in short supply, unfortunately, are songs by Elton John and Tim Rice. Did I really hear the couplet 'I don't think I'm qualified/ To come on all sanctified'? Can the song 'Friends Never Say Goodbye' have no words apart from its title, which Elton John endlessly repeats, sometimes dropping the word 'friends'? The lyrics, with their non-sequiturs and gnomic observations, sound as if they've resulted from a party game modelled on Consequences in which you write a line then pass the paper on to the new player with only the last word showing to get the rhyme.",

These two acres of self-made, verdant glory alone would be enough for most of us to get out a deckchair, put our feet up and let out a long, deep sigh of satisfaction. But not Monty. For him, the pleasure of gardening is in the doing, and it is plainly not possible for him to sit still for more than two minutes before he has switched on the hose, pulled out a watering can or dead-headed a few flowers that have just caught his eye. It's like a nervous twitch. </p> <p>It is difficult to know where to start describing the garden that Monty and his wife, Sarah, have created together since moving into their rambling 15th- to 16th- century farmhouse and adjoining stables in 1992. For a start, the pathways that link the formal topiary garden at the front of the house with the interlocking herb, vegetable, flower and spring gardens at the back, run through the house. On the warm July day when I visited, all the doors were open, creating a clear thoroughfare through the house. And I get the impression that it's the same even in the depths of winter, so that wheelbarrows - and the children's bikes or rollerskates - can speed through without interruption. 'The house and the garden are integrated,' explains Monty. </p> <p>To get a sense of the overall layout, you have to go upstairs, and then you get an idea of Monty's vision: 'I'd laid it out in my head for a long time,' he recalls. And then he set to work building fences, laying paths, dividing up the space. 'Everything is laid out in a grid - very linear - as a series of boxes. It's a Tudor house, so the garden is influenced by that. The thing I like most is space.' It is impossible to imagine that less than 10 years ago it was a grassy paddock. </p> <p>Looking out from above, you see that it is designed almost as a series of rooms, each one with its own flavour. There's the long corridor lined with noble alliums on either side. There's the herb patch, the vegetable garden, the greenhouses, the Jewel Garden at the centre and the orchard trailing into the distance with its perfectly spaced trees - there are 36 varieties of apple. </p> <p>At ground level, however, with the family's big old dog, Red, thumping her tail against your legs as she follows you on the guided tour, you forget the formality and get lost in the splendour and diversity of the plants. We walk past Tom's Shed, a work in progress by the youngest of the couple's children (he's nine and, along with Freya, 12, and Adam, 14, not particularly interested in gardening) and into the Spring Garden, which, says Monty, is unashamedly devoted to that one season. After spring, it goes to sleep until it is time to bloom once more. 'It's my favourite garden. It's so fresh and exciting and positive. And the light at that time of year is crystal clear.' </p> <p>In the summer, however, the focus is the Jewel Garden which, along with the all-important compost heap, is the heart and soul of the entire garden. The name refers to Monty and Sarah's former lives as jewellery designers, when they made paste brooches and dangly earrings, and when Monty himself wore rings in his ears. It's all about colour - the brighter, more piercing and vibrant, the better. 'If you look at the palette, it's all carefully chosen,' says Sarah, stroking some of her favourite grasses which, she says, have the texture of Freya's hair. 'Everything is selected; there's an awful lot of rejection of things.' </p> <p>'I really can't remember if the Jewel Garden was Sarah's idea or mine,' says Monty. 'We work as a team. I'm good on the big idea and doing, and Sarah's good at the details.' What's lovely about this garden is the height; most of the flowers are at eye level: if anyone else planted them, you imagine they'd grow to knee level. It's all in the preparation. 'Monty is great at soil conditioning,' says Sarah. 'The soil is so rich, things that are meant to be 3ft end up 9ft.' </p> <p>They make it sound easy, but Sarah says the garden is time- and labour-intensive. Each year, she and their full-time assistant, Gareth, raise 1,000 plants from seed for the Jewel Garden alone. This year was the first they could afford to invest seriously in bulbs, too. Most of the plants are quite traditional. 'Although it's very plant-orientated, it's a garden for plants, not plants for a garden,' says Monty. </p> <p>As well as flowers, there are herbs - great clumps of basil, thyme, marjoram, lovage, parsley, tarragon, sage - and a well-stocked kitchen garden of fruit and vegetables, including broad beans, onions, sweetcorn, strawberries, potatoes, peas and big, juicy marrows. There are frames crammed with cabbages, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, all ready for planting out. In the greenhouse, there are leeks, radicchio and peppers. </p> <p>'We don't grow anything edible that we don't eat,' says Monty. And, just to prove it, Sarah, busy in the kitchen preparing lunch, sends the children out with a basket to pick beans. Freya, whose duties include gathering sweetpeas for the house, goes off in search of the right herbs. </p> <p>'Sarah and I are both 100 per cent committed to organic-food production,' says Monty, who has just had to cut back all the potatoes because of blight. 'We don't spray them,' he says. So there are lots of slugs and snails. 'We try to encourage in as many insects as possible.' </p> <p>Lunch is one of those sublime, country-farmhouse affairs, with a huge pan of minty, buttery broad beans, potatoes so fresh they almost taste of the earth, local cheeses, a plate of cold meat, and crusty bread. Then, straight from the oven, there's a sponge cake piled high with just-picked raspberries. </p> <p>There are places to eat in the garden, too. 'I'm trying to introduce more places to sit,' says Sarah. 'For Monty, it's a place to work. But I like to eat in it, too.' Monty's creation is quite uncompromising. It's a gardener's garden rather than a place to while away the hours. When the children complained that there wasn't anywhere to play, a cricket patch was created. And at the front of the house, Sarah and Gareth planted another area last year, known as the Trampoline Garden because of its great, bouncy centrepiece where the children - and Monty - can use up excess energy. </p> <p>'You should have a sense of delight and surprise while feeling a sense of harmony,' says Monty. What is inspiring is his way of making you feel as though you, too, could make a garden like this. And his enthusiasm is infectious. Despite his high-profile persona as a television gardener and presenter, this was never intended as a show garden. It is a rare treat to be shown around a very private and personal space. </p> <p>Without his day a week working on it, and the mental image of every stem and flower that he carries with him on his travels, life for Monty would be unthinkable. It is his passion, his life. And that's exactly what makes it so vibrant and joyful.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Let's face it: physical defects are character forming. Nobody ever had to tell me to pull my socks up at school, literally or metaphorically. On the one hand, I was only too keen to stretch my white nylon hosiery as far up my knee as it would go in an effort to ward off playground taunts such as 'gorilla legs'; on the other, I was determined to work hard and get a decent job, since the hair which had been sprouting on my upper lip since the age of 11 clearly precluded any hope of my ever getting married.</p> <p>It's true to say that I found it difficult to maintain a positive attitude towards my hairiness in those days. As an adolescent it made me secretly, shamefully miserable. I hardly dared mention this fact to my mother, who tutted that people had far worse problems and that, in any case, the hair would thin out with (old) age.</p> <p>On a private visit to the family doctor - ostensibly about a verruca - I blurted out my fear that I was turning into a man (for what else could such swathes of thick, dark, luxuriant body hair mean?). He barely looked up from his prescription pad, but said vaguely he could give me some pills to take which would make the hair fall out - all over my body, including the scalp. I said I would think about it, but looking like a victim of nuclear fall-out wasn't quite what I had in mind. I wanted to look like the models in Vogue.</p> <p>I turned to the small ads. There were preparations (from Switzerland!) that guaranteed to leave your skin silky smooth and feminine for at least six weeks, or your money back. I sent for one. It cost \u00a330 for a small tub, in the days when I earned \u00a36.50 for a Saturday job as a shop assistant. It smelled like depilatory cream and dissolved the hairs on my arms to leave them silky smooth - until the next day, when the first signs of stubble appeared.</p> <p>I bought a hot waxing kit and closeted myself in my bedroom yet again. Waxing was at least mildly therapeutic. Of course, it's painful, since the molten wax solidifies on the skin in order to trap the hairs like insect legs in tempura batter, and sometimes it burns slightly. But I quickly learned that you mustn't let the wax get too cold, otherwise it loses its elasticity, and picking it off in pieces is excruciating. When all goes well, a simple, teeth-gritting rip upwards (against the hair growth) makes for bald stripes on your legs and affords the same satisfaction as mowing the lawn. Waxing at least left my legs relatively hair-free for a week or two, even if the regrowth was characterised by spots concealing in-growing hairs and a general prickly feeling under the skin.</p> <p>But I knew these fairly crude methods of hair removal would never do for my face. I'd heard of electrolysis, which was always mentioned in the same sentence as 'medically approved' (which it is) and a 'permanent method of hair removal' (which it isn't). It works by cauterising (with an electric current) the capillary veins feeding the hair roots - the diagrams you see on beauty salon walls are marvellously logical. By the time I was 15, I was saving the wages from my Saturday job to pay for electrolysis on my face and abdomen, but after a year of twice-weekly treatments, even the beautician conceded that it wasn't having much effect. I liked her; I thought she was honest. I continued having electrolysis in various salons for 10 years; it was better than shaving, for although the practice is as expensive as a drug habit (the going rate is currently \u00a340 an hour), the thought of revealing to the world that I was a bearded lady did not appeal to me.</p> <p>This first electrolysist differed from others I have known, however. Just as hairdressers sniff at the outgrown results of any previous style cut by a rival, so many electrolysists seek to blame their predecessors for any scarring, not to mention the troubling notion that the hair of some women cannot be tamed with a needle. In fact, for women like me, who have strong natural hair growth, electrolysis is like trying to walk up an escalator that is going down. I once jokingly pointed this out to the receptionist at a smart West End salon where I get my legs waxed, only to be taken aside by the salon owner and ticked off for sowing seeds of doubt in the minds of other clients. I was a little shocked by this - especially as I had previously bought a \u00a3700 electrolysis machine from her, thinking it would be cheaper in the long-term and more convenient to treat myself at home.</p> <p>I quickly grew bored with this project - my expensive machine languishes at the back of the cupboard, gathering dust. Electrolysists like to maintain that clients who experience little benefit from treatment have a 'hormone problem' and 'should see a doctor' which puts the ball firmly back in the medical court. But my experience of medical solutions is derived through the futile quests of hairy friends.</p> <p>Almost invariably, hirsute women are diagnosed as having Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS, a condition in which enlarged ovaries produce high levels of testosterone, is sometimes associated with infertility and obesity as well as hairiness and acne, but very often has no adverse effects at all. The most common treatment doled out by GPs these days is a form of the contraceptive pill, Dianette. I looked on with interest as my friend Julia took Dianette for a year, constantly searching in the mirror for the minutest improvements, and had electrolysis once a week. The benefits were disappointingly marginal, while the side effects included weight gain, headaches and loss of libido.</p> <p>Then hair removal by laser came along. The thought was thrilling and intriguing, like something out of science fiction. Another friend, Joanna, said she would save up for the treatment because, by all accounts, it was going to be expensive. But I had my doubts - after all, the laser works merely as a less invasive version of the electrolysist's needle. I'm glad I waited to see if other women were wasting their money or not. Dr Julian Barth, a dermatologist whose research in the field of hirsutism is unparalleled in this country, has posted a handy memo on the website of the British Medical Journal (bmj.com): 'Does laser treatment offer a permanent cure for facial hirsutism in women?' To date, the answer must be 'no'. There is certainly an initial reduction in the number of hairs after treatment, but after six months even an enthusiastic report states that 'much of the hair has regrown'.</p> <p>Electrolysis and laser treatment can be rendered more effective by simultaneous treatment with anti-androgens, which tackle the hormonal balance, making the hair finer and easier to remove.

It is often said by medical specialists that women with PCOS have to work out their priorities. For example, it's impossible to suppress unwanted hair growth and stimulate ovulation for infertility at the same time. This conundrum makes some sufferers feel like spiders lying in wait: to catch a man, you have to be smooth and hairless; to keep a man by providing him with children, you have to revert to your secret, furry self. As a feminist (and, luckily, a woman with no fertility problems) I never went down that route, preferring to punish my boyfriends for their thinly veiled body fascism by forgoing waxing during the cold winter months (what's wrong with nice, thick, black tights, anyway?).

      "bodyText": "Let's face it: physical defects are character forming. Nobody ever had to tell me to pull my socks up at school, literally or metaphorically. On the one hand, I was only too keen to stretch my white nylon hosiery as far up my knee as it would go in an effort to ward off playground taunts such as 'gorilla legs'; on the other, I was determined to work hard and get a decent job, since the hair which had been sprouting on my upper lip since the age of 11 clearly precluded any hope of my ever getting married. It's true to say that I found it difficult to maintain a positive attitude towards my hairiness in those days. As an adolescent it made me secretly, shamefully miserable. I hardly dared mention this fact to my mother, who tutted that people had far worse problems and that, in any case, the hair would thin out with (old) age. On a private visit to the family doctor - ostensibly about a verruca - I blurted out my fear that I was turning into a man (for what else could such swathes of thick, dark, luxuriant body hair mean?). He barely looked up from his prescription pad, but said vaguely he could give me some pills to take which would make the hair fall out - all over my body, including the scalp. I said I would think about it, but looking like a victim of nuclear fall-out wasn't quite what I had in mind. I wanted to look like the models in Vogue. I turned to the small ads. There were preparations (from Switzerland!) that guaranteed to leave your skin silky smooth and feminine for at least six weeks, or your money back. I sent for one. It cost \u00a330 for a small tub, in the days when I earned \u00a36.50 for a Saturday job as a shop assistant. It smelled like depilatory cream and dissolved the hairs on my arms to leave them silky smooth - until the next day, when the first signs of stubble appeared. I bought a hot waxing kit and closeted myself in my bedroom yet again. Waxing was at least mildly therapeutic. Of course, it's painful, since the molten wax solidifies on the skin in order to trap the hairs like insect legs in tempura batter, and sometimes it burns slightly. But I quickly learned that you mustn't let the wax get too cold, otherwise it loses its elasticity, and picking it off in pieces is excruciating. When all goes well, a simple, teeth-gritting rip upwards (against the hair growth) makes for bald stripes on your legs and affords the same satisfaction as mowing the lawn. Waxing at least left my legs relatively hair-free for a week or two, even if the regrowth was characterised by spots concealing in-growing hairs and a general prickly feeling under the skin. But I knew these fairly crude methods of hair removal would never do for my face. I'd heard of electrolysis, which was always mentioned in the same sentence as 'medically approved' (which it is) and a 'permanent method of hair removal' (which it isn't). It works by cauterising (with an electric current) the capillary veins feeding the hair roots - the diagrams you see on beauty salon walls are marvellously logical. By the time I was 15, I was saving the wages from my Saturday job to pay for electrolysis on my face and abdomen, but after a year of twice-weekly treatments, even the beautician conceded that it wasn't having much effect. I liked her; I thought she was honest. I continued having electrolysis in various salons for 10 years; it was better than shaving, for although the practice is as expensive as a drug habit (the going rate is currently \u00a340 an hour), the thought of revealing to the world that I was a bearded lady did not appeal to me. This first electrolysist differed from others I have known, however. Just as hairdressers sniff at the outgrown results of any previous style cut by a rival, so many electrolysists seek to blame their predecessors for any scarring, not to mention the troubling notion that the hair of some women cannot be tamed with a needle. In fact, for women like me, who have strong natural hair growth, electrolysis is like trying to walk up an escalator that is going down. I once jokingly pointed this out to the receptionist at a smart West End salon where I get my legs waxed, only to be taken aside by the salon owner and ticked off for sowing seeds of doubt in the minds of other clients. I was a little shocked by this - especially as I had previously bought a \u00a3700 electrolysis machine from her, thinking it would be cheaper in the long-term and more convenient to treat myself at home. I quickly grew bored with this project - my expensive machine languishes at the back of the cupboard, gathering dust. Electrolysists like to maintain that clients who experience little benefit from treatment have a 'hormone problem' and 'should see a doctor' which puts the ball firmly back in the medical court. But my experience of medical solutions is derived through the futile quests of hairy friends. Almost invariably, hirsute women are diagnosed as having Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS, a condition in which enlarged ovaries produce high levels of testosterone, is sometimes associated with infertility and obesity as well as hairiness and acne, but very often has no adverse effects at all. The most common treatment doled out by GPs these days is a form of the contraceptive pill, Dianette. I looked on with interest as my friend Julia took Dianette for a year, constantly searching in the mirror for the minutest improvements, and had electrolysis once a week. The benefits were disappointingly marginal, while the side effects included weight gain, headaches and loss of libido. Then hair removal by laser came along. The thought was thrilling and intriguing, like something out of science fiction. Another friend, Joanna, said she would save up for the treatment because, by all accounts, it was going to be expensive. But I had my doubts - after all, the laser works merely as a less invasive version of the electrolysist's needle. I'm glad I waited to see if other women were wasting their money or not. Dr Julian Barth, a dermatologist whose research in the field of hirsutism is unparalleled in this country, has posted a handy memo on the website of the British Medical Journal (bmj.com): 'Does laser treatment offer a permanent cure for facial hirsutism in women?'

I'm particularly pleased for two of my patients, who'd been struggling to overcome the drop in fertility that occurs during the late thirties and early forties. Interestingly (but not uncommonly), both women have developed gestational diabetes.</p> <p>Pregnancy predisposes the body's chemistry towards diabetes, as the number of cells that the body has to supply with insulin increases dramatically. Women who have passed their 26th week of pregnancy, are carrying excess weight or have a family history of diabetes are particularly at risk of developing gestational diabetes. The chance of it occurring also increases slightly with the number of pregnancies a woman has had, as well as with age.</p> <p>If you're diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy, don't panic. All that has happened is that your pancreas has become unable to produce enough insulin (the hormone that controls your body's blood-sugar levels) to keep your blood-sugar levels within the normal limits. In the majority of cases, adopting a healthy lifestyle and adjusting your eating habits and exercise routine can prevent problems occurring during pregnancy.</p> <p>After you have eaten foods containing sugar, your blood-sugar level normally rises, whereupon the pancreas releases insulin to help you and your baby's cells to absorb and use the sugar (glucose), after which your blood-sugar level should return to normal. If you have diabetes, because your unborn baby has the first claim on your shared supply of insulin, your body may be left with little to use for itself. You may feel more tired than usual, may also experience unquenchable thirst and may need to pay frequent trips to the loo. Excess weight hinders your body's control of its blood sugar, so keep active during your pregnancy. (Consult your doctor before engaging in any serious exercise routine, however, as it's important that your heart rate remains within healthy limits.) Some pregnant women find that because exercise lowers their blood-sugar levels (the muscles use glucose as fuel), they may feel a bit light-headed afterwards. If so, try eating a piece of fruit, such as a banana or a few dried fruits, with some yogurt before exercising. Eating a little of something healthy every couple of hours also helps to keep sugar and energy levels constant.</p> <p>The nutritional guidelines for gestational diabetes focus on drinking plenty of water and eating three regular, small meals a day. The meals should contain a high-fibre carbohydrate, fresh vegetables and fruit, a portion of lean protein (for your main meal) and a little dairy produce. Eating small amounts of high-fibre carbohydrates, like wholemeal bread, pulses, wholegrain rice, jacket potatoes, vegetables and fruit, helps to keep blood-sugar levels constant, as it takes some time for the thick cell walls that are present in the food to be broken down. Although you can still eat white pasta, bread, mashed potatoes, risotto or white rice, make sure that your meal includes some vegetable or fruit fibre to enable a steady release of sugar. Drink at least two litres of water a day so the fibre can do its job properly.</p> <p>Most women feel best if they start the day with a high-fibre breakfast cereal topped with some sliced fresh fruit. Or, you could have a couple of slices of wholegrain toast with a scraping of butter and a jam that is high in fruit and low in added sugar. (You don't need to buy diabetic products and can safely eat ordinary honey or jams - just don't consume too much and always team them with a source of fibre.)</p> <p>Chocolate, sweets, sugar-coated cereals, biscuits and pastries are rapidly absorbed and can send your sugar levels shooting upwards, so try to wean yourself off such sweet foods in favour of all types of fresh fruit (and ignore the myth that the sweeter fruits, such as grapes, mangoes and bananas, contain too much sugar). Aiming to eat three to five pieces of fresh fruit a day, either with your meals or as an energy-giving snack, is no hardship at this time of the year, when fresh soft fruit is plentiful. Keep a supply of dried fruit in your handbag in anticipation of low-energy moments, but don't have more than a couple at a time, as they can send sugar levels too high when eaten in excess.</p> <p>It is vital that you watch your intake of saturated animal fats, sugary, low-fibre foods and alcohol. Consuming too much fat - especially animal fat, which may occlude diabetic arteries - gives your body more calories than it can deal with, so opt for lean meats, fish, chicken and cooked eggs. Because being above the ideal body weight places extra strain on your pancreas, keep food light and fresh: cook with tomato sauces and herbs and use a little oil to enhance flavours rather than fat-packed sauces. Stick to unsweetened fruit juices alternated with herbal tea or water mixed with a little unsweetened squash. If you're desperate for something sweet, eat it after a fibre-containing meal rather than on an empty stomach.</p> <p>There is one mineral to which you should pay attention: chromium, an essential nutrient that plays an important part in the metabolism of glucose and insulin, and enables insulin to work more efficiently within the body. Include some chromium-rich foods in your diet, like baked beans, wholemeal products and shellfish (but make sure that the shellfish has been safely sourced and cooked). Don't take chromium supplements unless they have been prescribed by your doctor.</p> <p>Eating a healthy diet and staying as trim and active as possible should enable you to control your blood-sugar levels sufficiently well to enjoy a healthy pregnancy.

      "body": "<p> The other day, I was 74. For a birthday present, my literary agent passed on a letter from a publisher rejecting my new novel, Man in the Net. Once an illustrious name in British publishing, the firm is now part of Random House, which is owned by the German company Bertelsmann. </p> <p>On getting the script, the publisher's young editor (I'll call her Sarah) wrote a report that would delight any novelist: 'I really liked this book enormously.' On the strength of the first 40 pages, the book had already won an award from the Arts Council, where one of the judges called it a tour de force: 'I defy this author to produce a dull sentence. His characters start to vivid life almost as soon as they hit the page... tragicomic and grotesque-poignant images are legion.' </p> <p> Man in the Net was inspired by an incident on a foggy night in 1904 when the Russian fleet ploughed through some English fishing boats in the North Sea. Mistaking them for enemy torpedo boats, the Russians opened fire with heavy guns, then sailed away. The incident is fact, the rest is my fiction. The story of Stepan, a Russian anarchist conscripted to serve in a battleship instead of exile in Siberia, alternates with that of Harry, skipper of an English trawler, who next morning drags up something nasty in his net. </p> <p>Sarah wrote: 'I fell in love with Stepan and relished all the descriptions of his past and his idealism and I thought that the evocation of life aboard Harry's trawler was incredible. I never thought I would read descriptions of fish with such avidity, but I now feel I have a different relationship to skate and cod... </p> <p>'I was very moved by the way in which the two narratives eventually collided, and impressed by the author's ability to hold my attention in the days leading up to the collision when nothing very much was happening on board either ship. There was a wonderful sense of slowness and of the way in which people fill time.' </p> <p>Who would complain about that? There aren't many editors who can sum up a novel so articulately, let alone so flatteringly to the author. The trouble was that the publishing director wasn't so enthusiastic, finding my novel more melodramatic and earnest. And there was another snag. </p> <p>Crucially, as Sarah wrote to my agent: 'It would be difficult for us to publish, given all the standard arguments about it being late in the author's career etc. Therefore, I am going to have to be a philistine and turn down something which I know is of unusual and exceptional quality. I really hope that you find a publisher prepared to be braver that us - and please apologise to Nicholas Wollaston on my behalf.' </p> <p>Do they mean old or old-fashioned? My agent, after many years in publishing, lamented: 'What is publishing becoming?' Falling deeper into the hands of the marketing people is the answer. </p> <p>But what, I wonder, are 'all the standard arguments'? The notion that fortune - in the shape of a huge advance and a lot of hype for an unwritten first novel - favours the young? That the winner, so long as he or she has no literary record, takes all? That what sells a book is a pretty face on the jacket? No publisher would dare reject a book because the author was the wrong colour or the wrong gender, but to be the wrong age is unforgivable. </p> <p>I've had seven novels published and six non-fiction books and have never thought of stopping. When I asked a fellow septuagenarian if he would start on another novel he said no, he had nothing to write about. He seemed content, gazing at his garden and the years that pass. Not for me. When does one live, if not now? Who wants to go gently into that good night? I'm frantic to quarry the notes and thoughts I've been hoarding against the day when one of those dismal doctors, Alzheimer or Parkinson, comes knocking. </p> <p>Until then, I'll go plugging on. The more I read what other writers write, the more I itch to do it myself. Nobody at the Arts Council asked how old I was - it didn't matter to them. And I believe that what I write now is better than anything from the days when I had no problem getting a publisher. </p> <p>Well, I would say that, wouldn't I? An old bloke whingeing with self-pity, who hopes to be judged on words, not wrinkles. On the shelf, it's called. But the shelf is just where I'd like to be - the one in Waterstone's and the public library. Do people go in there for a book or for the author's date of birth? At a pinch, I'd change my name and borrow a photo of the barmaid in my local pub - or of Sarah, whom I've never seen - if it would do the trick. </p> <p>I cherish the lovely things she said in her report and I wrote to tell her so. She replied that she still felt extremely regretful that she wasn't able to be my publisher: 'It seems a great injustice that so much of the media are obsessed with youthful promise over seasoned wisdom.' </p> <p>The seasoning I accept; the wisdom is more dubious. I may have picked up some useful tricks here and there along the way, even collected a vaguely sober perspicacity to balance all the angst and whisky - nothing more. And I'm not jealous of the whiz kids - they're welcome to their glory because they'll be lucky if it lasts. </p> <p>I hope it's never said of me, in a melancholy reminder of autumn, that I have mellowed. Mellow means tired, unbothered, acquiescent, when the fire has gone, with the love and hate the passions. It's true, I'm only half alive, a sort of zombie, if I'm not working on a book. </p> <p>I shall start another, naturally, because there's nothing else to do - retirement is for other people - and I can still touch that small but faithful streak of arrogance that has always kept me going. Like Yeats, who sang 'a lasting song' in his prayer for old age, I shall be utterly happy if I'm seen by others to be 'a foolish, passionate man'. </p> <p> Man in the Net indeed!

      "body": "<p> Honk if you had sex last night! What - no one? </p> <p>Good for you. Sex has become so second millennium, especially in America, where people are flocking to join the sexual counter-revolution and throwing off the shackles of outdated Sixties ideology - or at least the bit where you were expected to jump into a Moroccan sleeping bag with the first Afro-coiffed, mustachioed drip in a bandanna who came along with an inviting lump in his hipsters. </p> <p>Nowadays, youngsters in the erstwhile land of carnal opportunity and free lurve are steadfastly refusing to take their knickers off until they've got a ring on their finger, while disaffected thirtysomethings with barely any mileage on the clock are buttoning up for the rest of their lives, sick to death of having to do it in trailer parks with unshaven dirt-cowboy types who pretend to like them for their minds. </p> <p>And while teens are egged on by premarital chastity cults such as True Love Waits (500,000 members and they all get a free badge and bumper sticker), the grown-ups have been wading through a flood of books and manuals on the joy of not having sex - titles such as A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue and Sensual Celibacy that have brought a chill to the libido of the Midwest and southern states (I don't think New Yorkers and Los Angelinos have shown much interest yet). </p> <p>Still, the papers are full of statistics to make Americans gasp: only 40 per cent of first-year students think it's OK to have sex with someone you've just met; the latest figures for young people unwilling to take the plunge (or who can't get a shag) has shown an alarming rise to 54 per cent. The media buzz-phrase (because there has to be one if it's going to be a proper movement) for sexual drop-outs is 'born-again virgins'. </p> <p>Features editors up and down the country are congratulating themselves on thinking they're the first to come up with headlines like 'Abstinence makes the heart grow fonder' and 'I'm just a girl who can say no'. It's healthy, spiritually cleansing, politically sound and entirely meat-free. But is it a real? Is celibacy the new vegetarianism? </p> <p>They say that when America sneezes, the rest of the world gets showered and sure enough a delegation from something called the Pure Love Alliance (oh yes, yes ) was outside Number 10 only last week asking the Prime Minister to tell our own adolescents to keep their hormones under control until such time as formal knots have been tied. Certainly, young people are not short of role models - Britney has taken the pledge, Ronan was a virgin until he got married, Cliff is an oft-cited example of moral probity gone mad. Even the Pope has managed to stay on the straight and narrow, though he must surely have had a few offers down the years. Meanwhile, Elle magazine tells us that 32 per cent of women have abstained from sex for six months and 27 per cent for a year or more. </p> <p>As you might expect, it's girls who are causing most of the trouble. But if women give up sex, where does this leave men (apart from in the spare room with a copy of Big Ones or, in the case of a small mindless minority, out in the stable with the goat)? Do men ever willingly become celibate while there are still live women around? </p> <p>'Yes!' says Martin Poulter, who is a research student at the philosophy department of Bristol University and runs an entertaining website (<a href=\"http://mail.bris.ac.uk/~plmlp/celibate.html\">http://mail.bris.ac.uk/~plmlp/celibate.html</a>) for 'voluntary' non-religious celibates like himself. He is not so much a born-again virgin as one of the traditional kind, though, less conventionally, he is anxious to keep it that way. 'My sex drive just never really materialised,' he says. He likes women but prefers purely 'hugging' relationships, which understandably are easier to start than to sustain. </p> <p>'The trouble is people think you must be emotionally cold if you don't want sex. Though some women deal with it positively, it makes others feel insecure - they take it personally when you don't want to sleep with them.' </p> <p>It's this tyranny of expectation that he is trying to break away from - to declare independence from the role of predatory male. </p> <p>'Basically,' he says, 'it's a question of following a lifestyle that matches my feelings, even if it means having to reject other people's ideas of what's inevitable.' </p> <p>Judging by his mailbag, Martin is not on his own. Karl, a financial services executive in his forties, says he also grew up lacking any kind of sexual orientation and spent years warding off women who took a romantic interest in him, until, finally, he 'felt the pressure of being an outsider too much to bear' and embarked on a series of unrewarding sexual relationships. </p> <p>'My body was slow to respond to the usual stimuli, though eventually it did - much to my disgust. I learned from these encounters that to live a lie in the name of conformity wasn't fair on anyone. Sex just isn't my cup of tea. I don't appreciate its physical sensations or understand the psychology of it.' </p> <p>William, a male nurse aged 31, has been celibate for seven years. 'Prior to that I had a number of short-lived sexual encounters. They had given me pleasure of sorts but also caused tension. I found myself either not being able to befriend the women I'd slept with or not sleeping with the women I'd been able to befriend. Giving up sex was the answer. It was a relief not to have to worry about whether someone fancied me or not - the sense of missed opportunity if the chance of a relationship passed me by or the sense of entrapment if one came to fruition.' </p> <p>It seems that most of Martin's celibate men are either virgins who have no sexual urge, virgins who don't want to rush into anything because they imagine sex is too important to throw away on just any Pam, Dot and Harriet, or men who have tried it and find the experience just too icky for words. </p> <p>'Make no mistake, I am very much attracted to women,' says Graham, now in his fifties. 'Nothing excites me more than seeing a woman in just her lingerie. But nothing makes me want to run away more than when she starts to remove it. I was with a girlfriend the night I made my decision to go celibate. She agreed, but the relationship dissolved soon afterwards. If I'm lucky, I'll never see a nude woman again for the rest of my life. If there was such a thing as \"militant celibacy\", I'd probably be regarded as an activist.' </p> <p>Say what you like but at least when men refrain from sex it's because they don't actually like sex. They're not trying to 'get in touch with themselves' like Geri or Caprice. They don't feel betrayed by a culture of sexual liberation gone haywire. They're not trying to punish their old girlfriends. They don't hate women. On the contrary, most seem to be looking for a stable, loving relationship with the kind of Miss Right who doesn't want sex either. </p> <p>And given the way things are heading, it could be their lucky year. </p> <p> <strong>Celebrated celibates</strong> </p> <p><strong> Stephen Fry</strong>, actor, comedian, writer, critic, novelist and taxi driver, was the UK's most prominent and vocal celibate for several years, although he has since rediscovered the alleged joys of wanton carnality. </p> <p><strong> Isaac Newton</strong>, the mathematician and scientist, was a life-long virgin. </p> <p><strong> Cliff Richard</strong> is one of the most vocal celibates of modern times. </p> <p><strong> Simone Weil</strong> was one of the best known European political thinkers of the twentiethth century and a lifelong celibate. </p> <p><strong> Stevie Smith</strong>, poet and novelist, was celibate all her life, after sampling and rejecting sex in her youth. She was fiercely critical of those who thought that her life must be emotionally impoverished by not having sexual relationships anymore, emphasising the depth of her friendships, especially the bond with her aunt, with whom she lived. </p> <p><strong> Pitt the Younger </strong> is agreed by historians to have died a virgin. </p> <p><strong> Carol Channing</strong>, the Broadway musical star of Hello Dolly, was celibate in her marriage to Charles Lowe for 41 years. </p> <p><strong> Morrissey</strong>, formerly of the Smiths, was openly celibate for several years. </p> <p><strong> Irma Kurtz, </strong> Cosmo 's agony aunt has been a celibate for years with no regrets. </p> <p><strong> Beryl Bainbridge</strong> revealed that she gave up sex because, when she was 56, she felt having a physical relationship with a man was 'no longer dignified'.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Honk if you had sex last night! What - no one? Good for you. Sex has become so second millennium, especially in America, where people are flocking to join the sexual counter-revolution and throwing off the shackles of outdated Sixties ideology - or at least the bit where you were expected to jump into a Moroccan sleeping bag with the first Afro-coiffed, mustachioed drip in a bandanna who came along with an inviting lump in his hipsters. Nowadays, youngsters in the erstwhile land of carnal opportunity and free lurve are steadfastly refusing to take their knickers off until they've got a ring on their finger, while disaffected thirtysomethings with barely any mileage on the clock are buttoning up for the rest of their lives, sick to death of having to do it in trailer parks with unshaven dirt-cowboy types who pretend to like them for their minds. And while teens are egged on by premarital chastity cults such as True Love Waits (500,000 members and they all get a free badge and bumper sticker), the grown-ups have been wading through a flood of books and manuals on the joy of not having sex - titles such as A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue and Sensual Celibacy that have brought a chill to the libido of the Midwest and southern states (I don't think New Yorkers and Los Angelinos have shown much interest yet). Still, the papers are full of statistics to make Americans gasp: only 40 per cent of first-year students think it's OK to have sex with someone you've just met; the latest figures for young people unwilling to take the plunge (or who can't get a shag) has shown an alarming rise to 54 per cent. The media buzz-phrase (because there has to be one if it's going to be a proper movement) for sexual drop-outs is 'born-again virgins'. Features editors up and down the country are congratulating themselves on thinking they're the first to come up with headlines like 'Abstinence makes the heart grow fonder' and 'I'm just a girl who can say no'. It's healthy, spiritually cleansing, politically sound and entirely meat-free. But is it a real? Is celibacy the new vegetarianism? They say that when America sneezes, the rest of the world gets showered and sure enough a delegation from something called the Pure Love Alliance (oh yes, yes ) was outside Number 10 only last week asking the Prime Minister to tell our own adolescents to keep their hormones under control until such time as formal knots have been tied. Certainly, young people are not short of role models - Britney has taken the pledge, Ronan was a virgin until he got married, Cliff is an oft-cited example of moral probity gone mad. Even the Pope has managed to stay on the straight and narrow, though he must surely have had a few offers down the years. Meanwhile, Elle magazine tells us that 32 per cent of women have abstained from sex for six months and 27 per cent for a year or more. As you might expect, it's girls who are causing most of the trouble. But if women give up sex, where does this leave men (apart from in the spare room with a copy of Big Ones or, in the case of a small mindless minority, out in the stable with the goat)? Do men ever willingly become celibate while there are still live women around? 'Yes!' says Martin Poulter, who is a research student at the philosophy department of Bristol University and runs an entertaining website (http://mail.bris.ac.uk/~plmlp/celibate.html) for 'voluntary' non-religious celibates like himself. He is not so much a born-again virgin as one of the traditional kind, though, less conventionally, he is anxious to keep it that way. 'My sex drive just never really materialised,' he says. He likes women but prefers purely 'hugging' relationships, which understandably are easier to start than to sustain. 'The trouble is people think you must be emotionally cold if you don't want sex. Though some women deal with it positively, it makes others feel insecure - they take it personally when you don't want to sleep with them.' It's this tyranny of expectation that he is trying to break away from - to declare independence from the role of predatory male. 'Basically,' he says, 'it's a question of following a lifestyle that matches my feelings, even if it means having to reject other people's ideas of what's inevitable.' Judging by his mailbag, Martin is not on his own. Karl, a financial services executive in his forties, says he also grew up lacking any kind of sexual orientation and spent years warding off women who took a romantic interest in him, until, finally, he 'felt the pressure of being an outsider too much to bear' and embarked on a series of unrewarding sexual relationships. 'My body was slow to respond to the usual stimuli, though eventually it did - much to my disgust. I learned from these encounters that to live a lie in the name of conformity wasn't fair on anyone. Sex just isn't my cup of tea. I don't appreciate its physical sensations or understand the psychology of it.' William, a male nurse aged 31, has been celibate for seven years. 'Prior to that I had a number of short-lived sexual encounters. They had given me pleasure of sorts but also caused tension. I found myself either not being able to befriend the women I'd slept with or not sleeping with the women I'd been able to befriend. Giving up sex was the answer. It was a relief not to have to worry about whether someone fancied me or not - the sense of missed opportunity if the chance of a relationship passed me by or the sense of entrapment if one came to fruition.' It seems that most of Martin's celibate men are either virgins who have no sexual urge, virgins who don't want to rush into anything because they imagine sex is too important to throw away on just any Pam, Dot and Harriet, or men who have tried it and find the experience just too icky for words. 'Make no mistake, I am very much attracted to women,' says Graham, now in his fifties. 'Nothing excites me more than seeing a woman in just her lingerie. But nothing makes me want to run away more than when she starts to remove it. I was with a girlfriend the night I made my decision to go celibate. She agreed, but the relationship dissolved soon afterwards. If I'm lucky, I'll never see a nude woman again for the rest of my life. If there was such a thing as \"militant celibacy\", I'd probably be regarded as an activist.' Say what you like but at least when men refrain from sex it's because they don't actually like sex. They're not trying to 'get in touch with themselves' like Geri or Caprice. They don't feel betrayed by a culture of sexual liberation gone haywire. They're not trying to punish their old girlfriends. They don't hate women. On the contrary, most seem to be looking for a stable, loving relationship with the kind of Miss Right who doesn't want sex either. And given the way things are heading, it could be their lucky year. Celebrated celibates Stephen Fry, actor, comedian, writer, critic, novelist and taxi driver, was the UK's most prominent and vocal celibate for several years, although he has since rediscovered the alleged joys of wanton carnality. Isaac Newton, the mathematician and scientist, was a life-long virgin. Cliff Richard is one of the most vocal celibates of modern times. Simone Weil was one of the best known European political thinkers of the twentiethth century and a lifelong celibate. Stevie Smith, poet and novelist, was celibate all her life, after sampling and rejecting sex in her youth. She was fiercely critical of those who thought that her life must be emotionally impoverished by not having sexual relationships anymore, emphasising the depth of her friendships, especially the bond with her aunt, with whom she lived. Pitt the Younger is agreed by historians to have died a virgin. Carol Channing, the Broadway musical star of Hello Dolly, was celibate in her marriage to Charles Lowe for 41 years. Morrissey, formerly of the Smiths, was openly celibate for several years. Irma Kurtz, Cosmo 's agony aunt has been a celibate for years with no regrets. Beryl Bainbridge revealed that she gave up sex because, when she was 56, she felt having a physical relationship with a man was 'no longer dignified'.",

There are white triangles moving out at sea, but inland, in the main square of a small village surrounded by vineyards and olive groves, the heat hangs thick as fudge under the caf\u00e9 parasols. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Thornton lives in a house on one of the narrow streets. When you step in, out of the midday dazzle, the light goes out and the temperature drops. This seems appropriate. Everything about H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's story is disorienting. </p> <p>Facts - dates, places, names - are like handrails. They help you to navigate the usual historical muddle. You know where you are with facts. However, they're not much help in this case. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's story is a little more fantastical, a little more Byzantine, a little more unknowable. It's a missive straight from the Grey Area, sprayed with Joy and stamped with sequins. </p> <p>There aren't many facts that we can be sure of, but here they are. On 30 June 1958, a 20-year-old Blackpool beauty queen called Elaine Smith married Jess Yates, 19 years her senior, who worked at the BBC. Less than 10 months later, Elaine gave birth to a daughter, Paula, who, as we all know, grew up to be a TV celebrity with a profile recently defined by her messily tragic personal life. In 1997, a DNA test revealed that Jess Yates - who found fame as the presenter of Stars on Sunday, and notoriety shortly afterwards when he was caught holidaying in the Canary Islands with a 16-year-old girl - was not in fact Paula's natural father. Instead, she was the child of Hughie 'Opportunity Knocks' Green, an old mucker of Jess's who had, in later years, become his implacable enemy. </p> <p>By this stage (I do hope you're still with me), both Jess and Hughie were dead and so unable to shed light on affairs. Elaine had changed her name to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Thornton, was living in the south of France with her second husband, and denied that she'd had any sort of fling with Green at the relevant moment. The rift between mother and daughter, which had first opened up after Paula left Bob Geldof for Michael Hutchence, grew wider. 'How could she be so cruel?' Paula asked the Sun. 'Why did she let me go through the humiliation of the DNA test when she must have known that there was a good chance of it being true?' Why indeed? </p> <p>We sit in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's kitchen. The house is barred and shuttered against the midday heat, and so the room is illuminated by an orange-fringed lamp that gives it a crepuscular, nightclub feel. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne wears a black spaghetti-strap vest, cigarette pants and high-heeled sandals. She has a silvery, gamine crop which she fluffs up with her fingers, and her eyeliner is La Scala by way of ancient Egypt. At 62, she still looks extraordinary: one imagines that people stare after her in the street for all the right reasons. </p> <p>Belle, part-Siamese, lolls sleepily on a blanket on the sideboard. She is one of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's 12 cats. 'And I have five refugees in the garage.' H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has agreed to meet me to publicise her new book which rejoices in the name of Cat Chat . Essentially, it's A Cat Year In Provence . It details how H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, furnished with scent and Rochas anti-wrinkle cream, came to the Midi in the late Eighties to write one of her historical romances, and fell in love with B\u00e9b\u00e9, a cat in the village, whose owner she subsequently married. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne agrees that B\u00e9b\u00e9 is the romantic lead in Cat Chat. 'My husband said once, \"I shall always wonder whether you married me or the cat.\" And it's very true.' </p> <p>In this characteristic passage, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne describes taking the housebound B\u00e9b\u00e9 out for a trip to the countryside: 'In an eruption of joy, B\u00e9b\u00e9 ran around a nearby field, returning to my side for a kiss and a \"Good boy\"... It was obvious that he had dreamed of such an outing, and the realisation of the dream had made this the very best day of B\u00e9b\u00e9's life.' H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's most audacious technique is to share with us not only her most private thoughts, but those of her cats, her suitor, the people who pass her in the street. Perhaps she has invented a new genre: a collective diary, beamed through a personal prism. The usual narrative rules simply do not apply. </p> <p>B\u00e9b\u00e9, sadly, died some time ago, but 'Monsieur' (as she refers to her husband Jacquelin Bosment, a retired flying instructor) is currently in bed downstairs. He's 80 and was briefly hospitalised in May, but is fit enough to open the bottle of champagne that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne - fingers nobbly with arthritis - is unable to tackle herself. Pouring generous slugs of Pommery into glasses, she describes Monsieur as 'very kind, likes his cats, likes his wife, likes doing crossword puzzles'. And now H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has caught the bug too. There's nothing she enjoys more than settling down with a pencil and Le Figaro. </p> <p>One cannot imagine the H\u00e9l\u00e8ne who stalks the pages of Paula Yates's 1995 autobiography - written long before the DNA business came to light - settling down with anything as ordinary as a crossword puzzle. This H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (the H\u00e9l\u00e8ne who was a teenage Bluebell Girl and who went on, under the name of Heller Toren, to bit parts in films and a subsequent career as a writer of 'sexy novels') is a fabulous, operatic creature in Pucci hotpants and lilac satin stilettoes, dancing to Astrud Gilberto in the empty corridors of the marital home, a ghastly-sounding Llandudno hotel which, Paula wrote, 'made Fawlty Towers look like the Crillon'. </p> <p>Where on earth did H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Thornton come from? Facts, facts. Let's start with those. Her father, George, was a Blackpool policeman, and her mother, Gertrude, took Mandrax 'and slept seven eighths of the day,' so she was mostly raised by her maternal grandparents. Oh, but hang on a bit, there's a fact in there that's not quite as concrete as you might have supposed. </p> <p>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne departs for the refrigerator and returns with salads and Vittel and baguette. 'I was 36 when my mother told me to go to the strongbox,' she begins, 'and to bring her some letters from the insurance company which were in blue envelopes.' But there was another blue envelope in the strongbox, too. And inside it was a mysterious letter from an unknown man: 'The implication was, \"She's my child, I would very much like to meet her.\"' Her mother refused to discuss this - indeed, wouldn't see her for four years after the incident - but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is now certain that her real father was 'a highly stylish gentleman' who took her to the park when she was four, and gallantly defended her, with his cane, from a violent gander. </p> <p>Many years later, at a local exhibition of her collages, a Frenchman whom she instantly recognised as the 'stylish gentleman' of yore ('he had the presence of an emperor, you know') approached her and suggested that they have lunch together. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has been telling me this tale with all her might, dropping her voice, raising it, pressing her palms against her cheeks to emphasise astonishment, and such is the seductive Brothers Grimm rhythm of it all that somehow I know exactly what's coming next. 'But he died two weeks later.' </p> <p>True, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is a thrilling storyteller. Equally, she is her own best listener. Just as there was never any point in discussing anything with Gertrude - 'I feel my mother had very little hold on reality' - it's certainly not worth pressing H\u00e9l\u00e8ne for banal details about the elderly Frenchman. (Had he ever been to England, let alone met her mother?) As far as she's concerned, the story is watertight. She believes it completely and, because it makes complete sense to her, she is oblivious to the illogicalities. </p> <p>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's childhood was, to say the least, Grand Guignol '. When her mother wanted a household gadget, she entered her daughter in beauty contests. 'If she wanted a television, and she'd read that a television was the prize, then she'd send me off to win it.' It was at such a contest, on her seventeenth birthday, that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne first met Jess Yates. He tried to take photographs of her undressing backstage. 'I gave him a bloody great push through the door. I said afterwards to my mother: I detest this man, he's odious.' </p> <p>Gertrude agreed. But not long afterwards, she became his mother-in-law. What on earth had changed H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's mind? 'The fact that my mother disliked him, for a start. The day of the wedding, let me tell you, was unforgettable. My mother screamed out in the middle, \"She's mine, she belongs to me!\" She wanted to control me, yes.' </p> <p>It was a case of frying pans and fires. 'Jess was very like my mother, curiously enough.' The marriage was in trouble almost immediately. 'In 1959, when Paula was about two or three months old, that was a period when Jess started going down the nick a bit mentally.' Prankishly, he'd always added a few senna leaves - 'opening medicine' - to the Earl Grey when they had guests ('He wanted to see the diarrhoea arrive in full view of everybody'), but after the marriage he started experimenting with tranquillisers. According to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. </p> <p>This brings us, with heavy sighs, to 'the Hughie Green thing'. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne did have an affair with Hughie Green, but 'when Paula was eight and a half'. Though Green visited the hotel for lunch shortly after her marriage, she insists she was already pregnant by then. 'I didn't meet him in the period of conception.' So what to make of the DNA tests? H\u00e9l\u00e8ne suspects the worst. 'I think somebody's done something. I don't know what. The blood wasn't taken in the laboratory. I have been assured of that.' She believes the DNA tests are at fault? 'As far as I can think anything, yes.' </p> <p>So it's a medical conspiracy. Or is it? Next, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne takes me back to marital chaos in the Welsh hotel, and tells me a story about passing out at 7.30pm after draining her postprandial coffee cup, prepared as usual by her husband. (In the real world, a person married to a compulsive doser would have taken to making their own Maxwell House; but in stories like these, people have to behave oddly in order to accommodate the more rococo plot twists.) </p> <p>The story goes as follows. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne wakes in the night, sensing that someone has touched her right shoulder, but Jess is snoring on her left. Her first thought is that someone is trying to abduct Paula, a few months old, who is asleep in her cot in the corner. She screams for Jess to switch on the light, but instead he flings the bedside lamp out of the window, into the courtyard. 'It was the beginning of the end of the marriage,' she says. 'The first thing that went through my head when I heard about [the DNA test] was: perhaps that was Hughie Green in the bedroom that night.' </p> <p> H\u00e9l\u00e8ne cannot explain why Jess would have wanted to help Green impregnate his bride (neither can she explain why he chucked the lamp out of the window), but the important thing is that she was the innocent party, the victim of their unfathomable schemes. And yet, 'I'm supposed to take the blame for absolutely everything.' </p> <p>Yes, it is a mystery - one of the greats. What is absolutely not in doubt is H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's ability to believe her own story. In her mind, either Hughie Green raped her after Jess had doped her to the eyeballs, or the DNA result was a fix. It's impossible to know whether she has always believed this. </p> <p>Paula hasn't been in touch for five years. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne sees the Geldof girls via Bob when she makes a rare visit to the UK but, of course, she has a fourth granddaughter whom she has never met. 'I see Miss Tiger Hutchence in magazines. Oh God, she's beautiful. I can hope. I love Paula. I shall always hope she comes. She will always be the special, special daughter that I love more than anything else in the world. But I can't make her want to see me again. I always hope that she'll stop this need to play Orphan Annie. </p> <p>'Famous people want to be, very often, somebody else. Paula, from a tiny child, always wanted to be famous. Jess always wanted to be famous. Jess Yates, BBC. Paula Yates, Famous Person. I wanted to be me... There are rocklike personalities who are sure of their own beliefs and their own selves, and there are those who need the accolade of celebrity. I see celebrity as something terrible.' </p> <p>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne takes me upstairs to her atelier (the floor is lined with litter trays and a Le Creuset pan full of prawns) to view her artwork. There is a series called L'animal imaginaire , and on the far wall is what H\u00e9l\u00e8ne calls her 'psychological portrait' of Paula. 'It's a form of collage, done on wood, and here it's written, \"This is a portrait of a little girl who lived in the big house on the hill, who was the most loved little girl in the world,' and here's a doll's face, and here are certain objects, symbols which I shan't explain to you.' The objects are some twigs, leaves, shells and sequins, and a gold key. If I could understand the symbols, would I understand Paula? Or, more to the point, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne? On reflection, it seems pretty unlikely. </p> <p> Cat Chat by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Thornton is published by Virgin at \u00a310.99</p>",

There are white triangles moving out at sea, but inland, in the main square of a small village surrounded by vineyards and olive groves, the heat hangs thick as fudge under the caf\u00e9 parasols. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Thornton lives in a house on one of the narrow streets. When you step in, out of the midday dazzle, the light goes out and the temperature drops. This seems appropriate. Everything about H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's story is disorienting. Facts - dates, places, names - are like handrails. They help you to navigate the usual historical muddle. You know where you are with facts. However, they're not much help in this case. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's story is a little more fantastical, a little more Byzantine, a little more unknowable. It's a missive straight from the Grey Area, sprayed with Joy and stamped with sequins. There aren't many facts that we can be sure of, but here they are. On 30 June 1958, a 20-year-old Blackpool beauty queen called Elaine Smith married Jess Yates, 19 years her senior, who worked at the BBC. Less than 10 months later, Elaine gave birth to a daughter, Paula, who, as we all know, grew up to be a TV celebrity with a profile recently defined by her messily tragic personal life. In 1997, a DNA test revealed that Jess Yates - who found fame as the presenter of Stars on Sunday, and notoriety shortly afterwards when he was caught holidaying in the Canary Islands with a 16-year-old girl - was not in fact Paula's natural father. Instead, she was the child of Hughie 'Opportunity Knocks' Green, an old mucker of Jess's who had, in later years, become his implacable enemy. By this stage (I do hope you're still with me), both Jess and Hughie were dead and so unable to shed light on affairs. Elaine had changed her name to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Thornton, was living in the south of France with her second husband, and denied that she'd had any sort of fling with Green at the relevant moment. The rift between mother and daughter, which had first opened up after Paula left Bob Geldof for Michael Hutchence, grew wider. 'How could she be so cruel?' Paula asked the Sun. 'Why did she let me go through the humiliation of the DNA test when she must have known that there was a good chance of it being true?' Why indeed? We sit in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's kitchen. The house is barred and shuttered against the midday heat, and so the room is illuminated by an orange-fringed lamp that gives it a crepuscular, nightclub feel. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne wears a black spaghetti-strap vest, cigarette pants and high-heeled sandals. She has a silvery, gamine crop which she fluffs up with her fingers, and her eyeliner is La Scala by way of ancient Egypt. At 62, she still looks extraordinary: one imagines that people stare after her in the street for all the right reasons. Belle, part-Siamese, lolls sleepily on a blanket on the sideboard. She is one of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's 12 cats. 'And I have five refugees in the garage.' H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has agreed to meet me to publicise her new book which rejoices in the name of Cat Chat . Essentially, it's A Cat Year In Provence . It details how H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, furnished with scent and Rochas anti-wrinkle cream, came to the Midi in the late Eighties to write one of her historical romances, and fell in love with B\u00e9b\u00e9, a cat in the village, whose owner she subsequently married. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne agrees that B\u00e9b\u00e9 is the romantic lead in Cat Chat. 'My husband said once, \"I shall always wonder whether you married me or the cat.\" And it's very true.' In this characteristic passage, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne describes taking the housebound B\u00e9b\u00e9 out for a trip to the countryside: 'In an eruption of joy, B\u00e9b\u00e9 ran around a nearby field, returning to my side for a kiss and a \"Good boy\"... It was obvious that he had dreamed of such an outing, and the realisation of the dream had made this the very best day of B\u00e9b\u00e9's life.' H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's most audacious technique is to share with us not only her most private thoughts, but those of her cats, her suitor, the people who pass her in the street. Perhaps she has invented a new genre: a collective diary, beamed through a personal prism. The usual narrative rules simply do not apply. B\u00e9b\u00e9, sadly, died some time ago, but 'Monsieur' (as she refers to her husband Jacquelin Bosment, a retired flying instructor) is currently in bed downstairs. He's 80 and was briefly hospitalised in May, but is fit enough to open the bottle of champagne that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne - fingers nobbly with arthritis - is unable to tackle herself. Pouring generous slugs of Pommery into glasses, she describes Monsieur as 'very kind, likes his cats, likes his wife, likes doing crossword puzzles'. And now H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has caught the bug too. There's nothing she enjoys more than settling down with a pencil and Le Figaro. One cannot imagine the H\u00e9l\u00e8ne who stalks the pages of Paula Yates's 1995 autobiography - written long before the DNA business came to light - settling down with anything as ordinary as a crossword puzzle. This H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (the H\u00e9l\u00e8ne who was a teenage Bluebell Girl and who went on, under the name of Heller Toren, to bit parts in films and a subsequent career as a writer of 'sexy novels') is a fabulous, operatic creature in Pucci hotpants and lilac satin stilettoes, dancing to Astrud Gilberto in the empty corridors of the marital home, a ghastly-sounding Llandudno hotel which, Paula wrote, 'made Fawlty Towers look like the Crillon'. Where on earth did H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Thornton come from? Facts, facts. Let's start with those. Her father, George, was a Blackpool policeman, and her mother, Gertrude, took Mandrax 'and slept seven eighths of the day,' so she was mostly raised by her maternal grandparents. Oh, but hang on a bit, there's a fact in there that's not quite as concrete as you might have supposed. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne departs for the refrigerator and returns with salads and Vittel and baguette. 'I was 36 when my mother told me to go to the strongbox,' she begins, 'and to bring her some letters from the insurance company which were in blue envelopes.' But there was another blue envelope in the strongbox, too. And inside it was a mysterious letter from an unknown man: 'The implication was, \"She's my child, I would very much like to meet her.\"' Her mother refused to discuss this - indeed, wouldn't see her for four years after the incident - but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is now certain that her real father was 'a highly stylish gentleman' who took her to the park when she was four, and gallantly defended her, with his cane, from a violent gander. Many years later, at a local exhibition of her collages, a Frenchman whom she instantly recognised as the 'stylish gentleman' of yore ('he had the presence of an emperor, you know') approached her and suggested that they have lunch together. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has been telling me this tale with all her might, dropping her voice, raising it, pressing her palms against her cheeks to emphasise astonishment, and such is the seductive Brothers Grimm rhythm of it all that somehow I know exactly what's coming next. 'But he died two weeks later.' True, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is a thrilling storyteller. Equally, she is her own best listener. Just as there was never any point in discussing anything with Gertrude - 'I feel my mother had very little hold on reality' - it's certainly not worth pressing H\u00e9l\u00e8ne for banal details about the elderly Frenchman. (Had he ever been to England, let alone met her mother?) As far as she's concerned, the story is watertight. She believes it completely and, because it makes complete sense to her, she is oblivious to the illogicalities. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's childhood was, to say the least, Grand Guignol '. When her mother wanted a household gadget, she entered her daughter in beauty contests. 'If she wanted a television, and she'd read that a television was the prize, then she'd send me off to win it.' It was at such a contest, on her seventeenth birthday, that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne first met Jess Yates. He tried to take photographs of her undressing backstage. 'I gave him a bloody great push through the door. I said afterwards to my mother: I detest this man, he's odious.' Gertrude agreed. But not long afterwards, she became his mother-in-law. What on earth had changed H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's mind? 'The fact that my mother disliked him, for a start. The day of the wedding, let me tell you, was unforgettable. My mother screamed out in the middle, \"She's mine, she belongs to me!\" She wanted to control me, yes.' It was a case of frying pans and fires. 'Jess was very like my mother, curiously enough.' The marriage was in trouble almost immediately. 'In 1959, when Paula was about two or three months old, that was a period when Jess started going down the nick a bit mentally.' Prankishly, he'd always added a few senna leaves - 'opening medicine' - to the Earl Grey when they had guests ('He wanted to see the diarrhoea arrive in full view of everybody'), but after the marriage he started experimenting with tranquillisers. According to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. This brings us, with heavy sighs, to 'the Hughie Green thing'. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne did have an affair with Hughie Green, but 'when Paula was eight and a half'. Though Green visited the hotel for lunch shortly after her marriage, she insists she was already pregnant by then. 'I didn't meet him in the period of conception.' So what to make of the DNA tests? H\u00e9l\u00e8ne suspects the worst. 'I think somebody's done something. I don't know what. The blood wasn't taken in the laboratory. I have been assured of that.' She believes the DNA tests are at fault? 'As far as I can think anything, yes.' So it's a medical conspiracy. Or is it? Next, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne takes me back to marital chaos in the Welsh hotel, and tells me a story about passing out at 7.30pm after draining her postprandial coffee cup, prepared as usual by her husband.

      "body": "<p>Cast your mind forward. It's 11am on Friday 1 September 2000, three weeks from now. A day of unprecedented clutter in the already crowded skies above London and the seven million people who live there. A day that air traffic controllers are predicting will be busier than any before.</p> <p>It's the end of the summer. The airways are busy with charter flights bringing British families home at the end of the school holidays. European business flights are also busy after the continental break which finished at the end of August. The queue for take off at runway 27R at Heathrow is getting longer and longer, with 12 commercial airliners waiting for final clearance. The air is shimmering with the stifling tang of Avgas exhaust fumes and full of the howl of tortured turbines. Aircraft are departing every one or two minutes, bloated with fuel and full of tightly strapped, apprehensive passengers heading into London or taking off to travel west, climbing to 6,000ft before turning right or left to fly over Dover, Midhurst, Southampton, Compton or Woburn, depending on the final destination. Aircraft are also taking off for European airports from London City, Farnborough and Northolt and for long-haul world flights from Gatwick, Stansted and Luton.</p> <p>If, at the same time, you were to stand behind the green glass of the Heathrow control tower and look up into the eastern sky you would see up to five aircraft, headlights blazing as they slip through the west London haze on their final approach. They have peeled off from the four Heathrow stacks at Bovingdon in Oxfordshire, Brookman's Park in Essex, Ockham in Middlesex and Biggin Hill in Kent.</p> <p>Each stack of circling aircraft starts at 7,000ft and rises to 18,000ft and the flights are spaced at 1,000ft intervals. There are two 1,000ft gaps in each stack through which outbound aircraft may pass. When the four Heathrow stacks are full, other stacks are created out towards the Essex coast and, if necessary over the North Sea by Air Traffic Control. The stacks are fed by a steady stream of incoming aircraft entering UK air space at Clacton or one of nine other sectors. In addition to the aircraft waiting to land at Heathrow, six further stacks are filling up with flights waiting to land at Gatwick, Stansted, London City and Luton. Aircraft which have left these stacks are also on their final approaches into London City, Biggin Hill and Farnborough.</p> <p>Below, helicopters are operating on routes through the centre of the metropolis to Battersea, the City, north and west London. Private aircraft are taking off from busy little airports at Elstree, Fairoaks, White Waltham, Denham and Blackbushe. Military aircraft are flying from Northolt, RAF Odiham and Brize Norton. The royal flight has aircraft coming in to Northolt and Buckingham Palace, and intercontinental flights are passing over the UK at high altitude, above the maelstrom. At any one moment, there could be well over 30,000 people strapped into their seats at various altitudes above London and the Home Counties.</p> <p>And if you were to introduce one or two unpredictable elements like, for instance, thunderstorms over the Thames at Richmond and a rogue private pilot who has managed to take off and fly north-east from Brooklands in Weybridge with no radio and without filing a flight plan, and a squadron of eastern European MIG29s flying in across the East Coast on their way to take part in an air show at RNAS Yeovilton, and if it had come to pass that the judgment of the Air Traffic Control Service had been compromised by subjecting it to the pressures of the marketplace, and if all these elements had conspired to occur at the same time, you might find that even the most self-confident and dedicated controller was secretly crossing his fingers as he looked at his radar.</p> <p>Perhaps we're worried about flying because more of us fly every year and we hear the noises aircraft make and we don't much like it. Paul Tizzard, who runs the over-stretched Virgin Fear of Flying course says that turbulence, the fear of being out of control and intimations of mortality (often post-childbirth) are the most common problems. But, perhaps it's also because somehow we know instinctively that the skies are becoming more and more crowded.</p> <p>Near misses are rare, but they do happen. At six minutes past three on the afternoon of Friday 28 April this year, a British Airways 747 and a British Midland Airbus came within seconds of colliding at Heathrow.</p> <p>Bad visibility throughout the south of England meant that aircraft were stacking for longer and flying further apart than usual that day, so most flight arrivals were delayed and some were running low on fuel. Air traffic controllors were under pressure and, to ease the congestion, aircraft were taking off and landing on the same runway. The BA747 with 450 passengers on board en route from Tokyo had been cleared to land on runway 27R. It was 26 minutes late but the crew had not reported any problems and the landing should have been routine. The final approach was to be handled by a supervised trainee who would bring the aircraft on to the runway and guide it to its stand.</p> <p>As the 747 made its final approach, descending through the murk over Richmond and Hounslow, a senior controller saw, to his horror, that the British Midland Airbus 321, carrying 89 passengers and seven crew, was on the same runway, 27R, and had been cleared for take-off. The two aircraft were an instant from collision. The controller instructed the BA captain to abort his landing and go round. Tension in the tower increased tangibly before the captain of the 747 confirmed that he had averted the disaster by no more than a few seconds.</p> <p>It was one of the closest near misses ever recorded at Heathrow and nearly resulted in the worst accident in British aviation history. I asked one of the controllers working on the day why it had happened. 'It was human error,' he said. But the real reason was not enough runway capacity.</p> <p>In their annual report, National Air Traffic Services (Nats) reported a total of 76 near-misses, or 'airprox' as they call them, over the UK in 1999. Of these, they say only five 'risk-bearing' incidents were their fault. Descriptions of the other 72 are not provided. Certainly, secrecy seems to be the watchword when it comes to discussing safety in the air. Attributable comments by operational staff which cast doubts on an airline's safety record are a sackable offence.</p> <p>Air traffic controllers work a rigid pattern of shifts designed to ensure that they are alert and focused during their one-and-a-half hour sessions before the radar. They work six days on followed by four days off and are meant to retire at 60, but no one I met from West Drayton can remember anyone still working as a controller past the age of 47.</p> <p>Which is all a bit worrying. When we are being flown from one crowded airspace to another, we want to be certain that the men and women on the ground who are going to guide us in are feeling happy and secure and are thus able to concentrate absolutely on the job in hand. A stressed and resentful air traffic controller is possibly a dangerous air traffic controller and low morale, for whatever reason, is in itself a flight safety hazard.</p> <p>As it stands, British controllers deeply distrust the government plans for a PPP (public-private partnership) because they are convinced it will compromise safety. When I talked to a group of men and women from the London and Manchester centres, they constantly referred to the safety ethic at the heart of their training. 'The PPP will tear Air Traffic [Control] apart,' said one. 'It is a public service and air safety is our operational priority. Privatisation will mean that the major objective becomes the return on the shareholder's investment. Where will the return come from?'</p> <p>Unfortunately, the controllers' expertise has become the problem: it has a commercial value and is the principal asset of the new company. 'As soon as we are privatised,' said Angus MacCormick, a senior controller operating at the Heathrow tower, 'the new company will be out in the international market and looking for business. The entire ethic of the organisation will change overnight.' The chief executive of National Air Traffic Services, Bill Semple, appeared to confirm this in a recent speech when he said that, 'together with our new private sector \"strategic partner\", we will be able to win lucrative business abroad and, like British Airways and BAA, will become a leading force in the air transport industry.' Such talk sounds like treason to the operators who do the job. When he was asked about the staff's concerns about safety in an interview last December, Semple dismissed them as 'rubbish'.</p> <p>'When BA was privatised,' said one controller, 'we were told that safety would never suffer and there is no doubt that BA is a safe airline, but over the years, what are seen as unnecessary costs become reduced until finally they are cut to the bone. National Air Traffic Services, like BA when it was a state-owned company, exceeds the statutory safety requirements and has its own standards. But it is in the nature of private companies that you cut your overheads to what you can get away with while working within the regulations. For instance, before they were privatised, British Airways crew would arrive on board the aircraft with plenty of time to check the safety equipment. Now they arrive 10 minutes or so before the passengers arrive and there is no time for checking the life-jackets, oxygen masks and so on, even though passengers have taken to stealing emergency equipment as souvenirs.'</p> <p>Every three months, confidential concerns submitted by airline workers and air traffic controllers are aired in an industry publication, the 'Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme'. Many are complaints about commercial pressures making it impossible for staff to comply with safety regulations. They paint a picture of a cumulative erosion of the safety ethic.</p> <p>A report last April described a general reluctance by flight crews to call for rescue and firefighting services to attend the aircraft after there had been an engine shutdown. Airlines hate emergency response because of the public relations implications. But air traffic controllers are, at the moment, unencumbered by such problems because safety is all they are concerned with.</p> <p>Because the market for passengers and freight is so aggressively commercial, the UK air traffic controllers say that it is vital to ensure that the safety services should remain separate from and uncompromised by pressures of the marketplace. One of the foundations upon which they operate is the principle of first come, first served. Recent suggestions by BA and Lufthansa that there should be a two-tier service in which privileged airlines who have paid for preferential treatment can precede other carriers would be hard to resist by a commercialised air traffic service. But controllers believe that the scheme would create dreadful problems on the ground. However, Ian Hall, a general manager at West Drayton talked to me of 'discounting' routes to encourage carriers to undertake longer, less convenient journeys when congestion is high, in return for reduced fees. 'It's something we can do with privatisation,' he said.</p> <p>Pressure on airways from congestion also means that passenger flights outbound from Heathrow are often cleared for take off only 60 seconds apart. There have been numerous reports of severe wake turbulence affecting small and medium sized aircraft following larger aircraft. One or two carriers insist on a two-minute delay, a demand which costs money and is not popular.</p> <p>The desire of airline management to cut operating costs by reducing the amount of excess fuel carried over the legal limit has, according to one of those unattributable reports, resulted in frequent 'to the wire' operations when bad weather has resulted in delays and contingency fuel reserves have been cut. A Malaysian Airways 757 landing at Heathrow in May last year proved to have a dangerously low fuel level in its tanks when it arrived on its stand. According to David Learmount of Flight International, it was the tenth time this had happened in only a few months. Heavy fuel loads cost money to fly and are increasingly discouraged by many airline managements. It is also now common for airlines to use twin-engined planes to fly across the Pacific - much to the concern of a Virgin captain who told me that he is not happy with the concept of 'a B777 being forced to fly halfway across the pond on a single engine after the other one has failed. Yet that is what could happen under the present system'.</p> <p>The National Air Traffice Services control centre for London at West Drayton moves to its brand new state-of-the-art centre in Swanwick, Hampshire, in January 2002 - six years late. The original prediction of a 1996 opening was hopelessly optimistic, the result of aggressive bidding for the software contract and politicking before the forthcoming general election.</p> <p>Swanwick comes not a moment too soon. The computer at West Drayton is beginning to show its age. Air traffic controllers operating the system claim that the computer breakdown in June, which resulted in massive disruption and the flight progress strips having to be written out by hand, was caused by a software 'bug' which took years to manifest itself and was the result of computer overload. It was a serious emergency.</p> <p>The Department of Transport and National Air Traffic Services senior management claim that privatisation is vital because of the need for investment to accommodate the massive demand predicted over the next 20 years. Semple says he is looking for \u00a31 billion to pay for new technology to help controllers cope with increased traffic and fund the introduction of greater capacity. He also wants to spend cash on testing new systems which will at last replace the manually produced paper flight progress strips.</p> <p>Unless something is done to accommodate the demand for airspace, civil aviation will undoubtedly grind to a halt in a morass of delays and safety problems. I have talked to pilots who are convinced that a major air traffic disaster is just waiting to happen. Investment in new technology is vital. The problem is who should pay for it.</p> <p>On 29 September last year, John Prescott dismissed staff fears about safety as 'ideological'. Let's hope that it does not take a disastrous collision to make him change his mind.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's Thursday morning on the Fox lot in Hollywood, and more than 100 people have squeezed into a long, plain conference room to witness the birth of a new episode of The Simpsons. These 'table-reads' involve all senior Simpsons staff flicking in unison through the latest script - giggling, guffawing, nudging, tittering and making notes - while the actors perform the parts. The attire is strictly Los Angeles heat wave, just T-shirts and grins, with the pencil-chewing writers at one end of the table and the actors, or 'voice artists', at the other. Every remaining square inch is crammed with producers, directors, animators and spectators, including a remarkably well-behaved sprawl of staffers' kids who have come to see Homer on their summer holidays.</p> <p>'Hi, everyone,' says Mike Scully, with a little wave. Scully is executive producer and skipper of the good ship Springfield (the Simpsons' home town) - a jocular sort with an irrepressible chuckle and a nerdy timbre to his voice, not unlike The Simpsons' own Professor Frink. 'Got some good news. We've been nominated for an Emmy, Best Animation.' Everyone claps. 'And let's congratulate Hank Azaria on his Emmy nomination for Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays with Morrie .' (Azaria is a straight actor as well as the voice of Moe, Apu, Wiggum and several others.) More clapping.</p> <p>But the applause is mild rather than jubilant, a far cry from speeches and champagne: The Simpsons is no stranger to awards, with 15 Emmys to date. Some mumble about whether Best Comedy might have been more apt, or Best Sitcom, but the murmuring is cut short by the cry of Ned Flanders, Homer's ultra-Christian neighbour. 'Son of a diddly!' We flick to page one. Dan Castellaneta unleashes his Emmy- winning Homer. Let the giggles commence. The new script, 'Trilogy of Error', is particularly ambitious, twice jumping back in time and using three different story viewpoints: Marge accidentally chops off Homer's thumb as he reaches for a brownie, so Homer needs to get to hospital while Lisa needs to get to school while Bart, naturally, sets up a local mobster in a fireworks sting. One scene finds Homer trying to thumb a lift without a thumb.</p> <p>'That worked pretty well,' beams Scully, as everyone files out. 'I wasn't sure whether people would get into that back-in-time thing, but I was pleasantly surprised. No need for any rewrites there!' And he cheerily ambles off to the rest of his day, chivvying the animators, reworking scripts and sitting around with his 16-strong writing team, throwing out ideas. 'Oh, we'll get all those dirty story ideas as usual,' he laughs, 'you know, Ned fucking Marge - we've had them all. Same with jokes. We seem to spend two hours a day getting through all the jokes we can't use. It's part of the process.'</p> <p>With all the casual geniality, it's easy to forget how huge this bug-eyed, three- fingered, yellow-skinned family has become. On 2 September, Homer and co celebrate 10 years on Sky One, a decade in which they gave Murdoch's satellite venture credibility and rescued his ailing Fox network in the US, now bolstered by The X Files and NYPD Blue. The Simpsons booted animation out of the Flintstones era, sitcoms out of the Cosby Show era; it revived satire, took a hammer to political correctness, entered The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations and, within its first 15 months, reputedly sold more than $2bn of merchandise: you can now buy Simpsons bandages, car mats, pinball machines, asthma inhaler cases and a PlayStation game, due out soon.</p> <p>And there's more. In France, The Simpson s advertises Pepsi and Heinz. It is the longest-running animated primetime show in history, and it airs in so many countries nobody seems to know for sure - the last count, in August 1998, was 66. Curiously, the Japanese requested that all characters were redrawn with four fingers rather than the cartoon tradition of three. The request was ignored, and The Simpsons swept Japan anyway. And no sooner had George Bush Senior famously declared, in 1992, that: 'The nation needs to be closer to the Waltons than the Simpsons,' than Homer had the President in a headlock, wrestled him in a sewer and the Democrats won the next election. Al Gore has since asked to be on the show but was politely declined - 'We tried to get Al Gore on several years ago but were turned down,' says Scully, 'and as far as I'm concerned he had his chance.' Oh, and Time magazine called it the best TV show of the century.</p> <p>Such is the programme's success that, in the spirit of celebration, the cast is taking the show on the road next week, to London's Playhouse Theatre and the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh. The concept is simple - just a bunch of actors on barstools on stage, reading through a few classic episodes for the fans. Yet already, the Simpsons Mania tour has broken records, selling out its Edinburgh shows in just 55 minutes.</p> <p>'I think I now know when The Simpsons was born,' says creator Matt Groening (pronounced 'Graining'), a friendly bear of a man - affable, bearded and heavy-set, with tiny eyes, a ferocious intelligence and an unruly fringe. Now more absorbed in his fol low-up, Futurama (the animated adventures of a cryogenically frozen pizza-delivery boy), Groening leaves the daily reins of his flagship show to Scully, busying himself with grander projects, such as a forthcoming Simpsons feature film.</p> <p>'It was about 1960, when I was six years old, and I used to watch this live-action show, Dennis the Menace . I was thrilled that this kid was supposed to be a menace, but he turned out to be a bit namby pamby, bit cute for me. I wanted a real menace.' And so Bart was born. In the early days, the rest of the family were foils for Bart's mischief and Homer was an angrier animal than the lovable oaf he has become. But Groening long knew his new project would outgrow any one character. 'I knew the show could be a long-running sitcom and I had the last episode all written out from our first show. Still have and I'm not telling anyone.'</p> <p>In 1987, Groening's 'Life in Hell' cartoon, now syndicated by more than 250 publications worldwide, attracted the attention of James L Brooks, a senior Hollywood honcho who gave the world Taxi, Lou Grant, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, the film Terms of Endearment and, more recently, As Good As It Gets. Brooks warmed to this surreal and often acidic one-hit strip featuring, for example, an alarmed one-eared bunny called Bongo, and so he summoned Groening, then a struggling animator, and asked for an animation short, known as a 'bumper', to pep up his low-rating Tracey Ullman Show. He wanted 'Life in Hell', but Groening offered him The Simpsons . When asked for their names, however, Groening paused - 'Names? Erm...' - and on the spur of the moment, he trotted out the names of his family, although, he insists, that's where the similarity ends. Groening's father is called Homer, his mother Marge, his sisters are Lisa and Maggie and, as for Bart, it's an anagram of Brat. Groening has called his son Homer, too, in honour of his father, so there are now three very prominent Homers in his life.</p> <p>Fox noted the Simpsons ' success, even as a bumper, and promptly commissioned a series of 13 episodes, which launched for the first time in January 1990. Nine months later, it made a splash in the UK.</p> <p>Groening's Springfield universe is a towering creation: a rich, primary-colour dystopia blessed with an ever-burning tyre mountain and a hazardous lethal nuclear power plant. The plant is run by the billionaire Mr Burns, a feeble 104-year-old who inspires secret gay fantasies in his repressed assistant, Smithers. The corrupt womanising Mayor Quimby sounds uncannily like John F Kennedy. The school is run by a mother-obsessed school principal, the police chief is a doughnut-munching loaf and Moe, the local barman, keeps pandas in the basement. In Springfield, people drink, smoke and break all those unwritten rules of live-action TV. And everyone is blissfully immersed in a life of screwing everyone else. 'I think that's one of the lessons of the show, that these figures of authority, they might not always have your best interests at heart,' grins Groening. 'Entertain and subvert, that's my motto.'</p> <p>At the centre of the community are the Simpsons themselves, a dysfunctional nuclear family in which Bart, the hell-bent scamp, is balanced by Lisa, his eight-year-old genius saxophonist sister, with Marge serving as the home's most reliable centre. For many fans, however, The Simpsons is dominated by Homer, an impulsive, cretinous, big-kid buffoon driven by an endless pursuit of beer, doughnuts and that elusive meal between brunch and lunch. The Simpsons' lives revolve around the television - every episode finds them glued to its spew of trash and propaganda. And Springfield's TV is populated by equally pointed caricatures such as Itchy and Scratchy, the wincingly violent Tom and Jerry take-off, and Troy McClure, the all-purpose struggling daytime actor whose videos include 'Get Confident, Stupid' and 'Smoke Yourself Thin'.</p> <p>Yet even as his show satirises television obsession, it inspires a similar devotion in its millions of fans. The official Simpsons internet site is a daunting archive of minutiae, observations from obsessives in Ontario, endless lists, quotes, essays and debates until every stone in Springfield has been uncovered. Perhaps drawn by the show's numerous highbrow cultural references, it attracts the attention of rhapsodising academics and literati worldwide. Edinburgh's Napier University, for example, now runs a course in its Cultural Studies module entitled 'Having the Donut and Eating It: Self-Reflexivity in The Simpsons'. The writer Gilbert Adair declared that 'The Simpsons is a chef-d'oeuvre to which the work of no currently practising English-language novelist is comparable in importance or greatness.'</p> <p>The impact of The Simpsons at the end of the 80s, when the smothering agendas of political correctness held sway, was considerable, stirring up a nanny-state fuss about setting examples for children. Now, the shock value of Bart's 'Underachiever and Proud Of It' T-shirts has long been surpassed by such coarse Simpsons descendants as Beavis and Butt-head and South Park . But the late-80s was a cosy, Cosby era. 'We were definitely at the right place at the right time,' says Groening, 'at the end of a decade of real complacence, a lot of upper-middle-class family comedy. So we gave them a dose of something really crude and unglamorous.'</p> <p>The Simpsons became a trailblazer in TV's blue-collar renaissance, with Roseanne and Married... with Children for peers. It became cool to be coarse and ordinary and upfront. But The Simpsons owes its endurance to the essential integrity of its characters. For all of Homer's animated freedoms - the dream sequences, the conversations with his brain, the car crashes and trips to hell, all the things a live-action character simply can't do - the kernel of his character has remained intact from the first show. As Groening stipulated from the off, the inhabitants of Springfield should always be treated as real people. They are not mere gag puppets, forever being flung off cliffs and blown up just because they're animated.</p> <p>Besides, all the talk of shocking dysfunction rings hollow 10 years on, for the Simpsons are still together, as are the original cast members. As Groening says: ' The Simpsons shows us that you can love the people who drive you crazy.' Homer ultimately heeds Marge's warnings and wouldn't dream of cheating on her. He even goes to church. In fact, Springfield is far from a godless place - God in The Simpsons has four fingers, and the writers relish the opportunity to drag Him into proceedings. 'We like to go into areas that most shows don't touch,' says Scully. 'Religion's a big one with us. In one show, Bart sells his soul for $5 because he didn't believe there was a soul, so he thought he'd made the deal of the century. Then, during the show, all these things start happening to him. And Lisa, she's the kind of character who argues religion versus science. These are great areas to write about.' Homer, of course, sold his soul to the devil for a doughnut.</p> <p>As head of the writing corps, Scully's task is both enviable and formidable. On the one hand, The Simpsons is one of those rare gigs in television that affords the writers genuine creative freedom, thanks to Groening's insistence at the outset. Which explains the risqu\u00e9 gags about drunken Irishmen, rickshaw-riding Chinamen, the stereotypical Apu and Marge's smoking sisters, all of which would have risked the knife were the network permitted to pitch in. But it is also such a jokey and sophisticated show, in which the upper reaches of hilarity are speckled with erudition and belching in equal measure, that it has become something of an industry standard for sitcom writing.</p> <p>The pressure is on. To live up to its own reputation, each 21-minute show should work at several different levels, be an incisive, multilayered tapestry of cultural reference. As Groening puts it: 'I like to entertain people who can't read.' Little wonder that the animators, the actors, even the pizza-delivery guy all marvel at the brilliance of the writing team, how sharp, quick-witted and scholarly they are, if occasionally a tad socially aloof as a result.</p> <p>'Well, there's 16 of us, all between 26 and 45 years old,' says Scully. 'There was a time when we were 90 per cent Harvard graduates, a good proportion of whom came straight from university, this was their first job. I know, it drove me crazy - I kept telling them, \"Do you realise how good it is here?\" We have a couple of stand-ups, some gag writers, sitcom writers, a former biochemist and an advertising copywriter called John Schwartzwelder who has written more than 51 of our episodes. But I get applications every day. People leave me voicemails saying, \"Hire me, I know more about it than anyone,\" which is one technique, I guess.' This morning, some 40 scripts from hopeful applicants have arrived.</p> <p>An acute perfectionism runs through the production process at The Simpsons, right down to the use of a 35-piece orchestra and in-house composer, one Alf Clausen, who has scored the show from the start. The writing process, certainly, obeys the mantra 'I must, I must, improve my script'. After the original submission and its brutal reworking by the team, there are several opportunities to hone, tweak or totally flip a script. First there is the table-read, then the voice parts will be recorded in a studio. Working from the script and voicetrack, the animators will prepare key shots, storyboards, new characters and scenes and at every juncture the team can either OK or red-ink the work.</p> <p>Which explains the scene this Friday at Film Roman, The Simpsons' huge animation studio, where an army of animators and storyboarders beaver away beneath a forest of anglepoise lamps. There is a heap of pizza boxes in the kitchen and the corridor walls are emblazoned with garish overbites and bulging eyes, an animation style we first found creepy. Unlike Garfield or the cuddly Sesame Street characters who go cross-eyed in times of trouble, Springfielders adopt the wall-eyed Marty Feldman look - from cute to hellish in a single stroke.</p> <p>At the end of the corridor, however, a caucus of post-production animators bite their lips and stare gloomily at the rewrites board. 'Look at what we got back from the writers the other day,' says Jim Reardon, the supervising director. 'These are rewrites that came back from the writers at Gracie [Gracie Films, the production company].' One is 15 pages long. Reardon casts a glance at his forbidding schedule, a cascade of weekly deadlines, and shrugs. This is why The Simpsons is a success. Should the writers decide that the character doesn't fit the voice, or the timing's off, or there's simply a snappier joke to tell, then the sheets go up and 80-odd animators in LA - and about 100 last-stage painters in Korea - mobilise accordingly.</p> <p>Far away from the quotidian labour of cartoons, as Clausen composes his scores, as the Koreans feverishly paint away, as the writers dissect another script, Groening, the master architect, ponders his invention in the table-read room at Fox Studios. ' The Simpsons was all about my underground sensibilities invading mainstream culture,' he says. 'I mean, my personal tastes are a little obscure - the last CD I bought was this Hawaiian steel-guitar album from the 20s. I find most popular culture very flat and repetitive, so often I'll see a script and I don't get some of the references, or I'm not familiar with the stars.' The show frequently features celebrity cameos - the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Martin Sheen, Jack Lemmon and 110 others over the years. 'People don't believe me, but I didn't know who U2 were before we invited them on the show. But they're exactly the guys we want to be featuring - U2, Aerosmith and Michael Jackson. That's our mission.'</p> <p>Groening finds no conflict in marrying mainstream culture with his own esoteric tastes. Just as he mocks the TV nation via a TV show about TV obsessives, and attacks greedy conglomerates by way of Rupert Murdoch's Fox network, he derides the current US political climate as one of bland consumption and conservatism. Yet he is happy to hire ornery republicans on to his writing team, 'because they happen to be very funny, albeit hopelessly deluded. Sure, there are contradictions - but isn't life like that?'</p> <p>Equally, The Simpsons reflects the common experience of muddling through shades of grey, sure that life is not a series of simple black and white choices, but still unsure of the way ahead. In many ways it is much more realistic than other TV fodder. 'At the time we came out, the overriding message of most TV comedy was that nothing matters and you're a fool for caring,' says Groening. 'We just offered a non-depressing alternative to that. And we want people to question, to read. There's a subtext going on with the show that it's OK to be smart, that if you read more books then you get more jokes. But you know what? TV is a barrage of urgent imagery and alarms interspersed with urgent imagery trying to sell you something. So, to operate in that arena, you have to be garish, bold and physical. You have to hit people over the head with physical gags. No matter how clever you are, you've got to have Homer slam into a brick wall at some point.'</p> <p>And he ups and leaves, all handshakes and bonhomie. What will Groening, whose love-hate relationship with television bore television's finest fruit, be watching on the small screen tonight? 'I hardly watch TV,' he grins. 'Too much else to do.'</p> <p>Famous fans who stays in to watch The Simpsons</p> <p><b> Glenda Jackson</b> 'I initially watched The Simpsons because of George Bush's comment [he pledged to build an America 'less like The Simpsons and more like The Waltons '] and I catch up with it whenever I can. It really makes me laugh but it isn't all funny - some of it can be quite moving. Lisa's the little girl I would love to have been - there wasn't such a thing as feminism when I was young. Although it would be hard to pinpoint a favourite show, I love the episode when Maggie was put in the cr\u00e8che for the day and organised the Great Escape.'</p> <p><b> Damien Hirst</b> 'My son loves it, I love it, and we can watch it together and both see something funny in it. The characters are fabulous. Plus Homer has superb underpants. I think Marge's sister, who's always smoking, is great. My favourite episode is when Homer is poisoned by eating blowfish in the Japanese restaurant.'</p> <p><b> Stephen Hawking </b> 'The Simpsons are often cited as an example of the dumbing down of the media, but in fact they are the cleverest show on American television (not that there's much competition). I have seen for myself how much care they take with scripts, and they all have a moral. I like Lisa the best.'</p> <p><b> Charlotte Church</b> 'My father's like Homer because of his big belly and his love of beer, and Mum's like Marge because she always moans. Even my grandfather's as mad as the Simpsons' grandfather. I find Homer the funniest, and my favourite episode is when Krusty the Clown starts his career and shares the show with Bette Midler - it was brilliant.'</p> <p><b> Melvyn Bragg</b> 'I watch The Simpsons for the dialogue. The cartoons are OK, but the writing is terrific.'</p> <p><b> Bob Hope</b> 'The Simpsons are my favourite family. I have loved Lisa ever since I worked with her on the show. Everybody needs a Marge in their life, and Homer will do all right. However, I'm of the opinion that Bart could use some counselling.'</p> <p><b> Tom Jones</b> 'I'm a Simpsons fan and I was flattered when they asked me to appear in it. You never know what you're going to look like in a cartoon, but I liked my drawing (below) - they did a good job. Everybody in my house laughed like hell.'</p> <p><b> Claire Rayner</b> 'I've always had a soft spot for Marge, partly due to Julie Kavner's voice, and also because she is amazingly tolerant and holds her whole family together. I like her ruefulness. She knows she's stuck, but she makes the best of it. The daughters come a close second. Both the guys are what you'd expect them to be, and Homer's so blissfully sure of himself.'</p> <p><b> Mel Giedroyc from comedy duo Mel and Sue </b> 'My favourite is Marge, and I've worked out a great technique for doing her voice. Go to a rave and smoke 20 fags on the trot. Then drink five Diamond Whites. When you get home, sit in front of your open fridge and then sleep next to an open window. Set your alarm extra early and when you are rudely awakened, say, \"Oh Homey, I'm concerned about Lisa.\" The results are pretty mind-blowing.'</p> <p>\u0095 The Simpsons is on Sky One daily, and BBC2 on Fridays</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's Thursday morning on the Fox lot in Hollywood, and more than 100 people have squeezed into a long, plain conference room to witness the birth of a new episode of The Simpsons. These 'table-reads' involve all senior Simpsons staff flicking in unison through the latest script - giggling, guffawing, nudging, tittering and making notes - while the actors perform the parts. The attire is strictly Los Angeles heat wave, just T-shirts and grins, with the pencil-chewing writers at one end of the table and the actors, or 'voice artists', at the other. Every remaining square inch is crammed with producers, directors, animators and spectators, including a remarkably well-behaved sprawl of staffers' kids who have come to see Homer on their summer holidays. 'Hi, everyone,' says Mike Scully, with a little wave. Scully is executive producer and skipper of the good ship Springfield (the Simpsons' home town) - a jocular sort with an irrepressible chuckle and a nerdy timbre to his voice, not unlike The Simpsons' own Professor Frink. 'Got some good news. We've been nominated for an Emmy, Best Animation.' Everyone claps. 'And let's congratulate Hank Azaria on his Emmy nomination for Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays with Morrie .' (Azaria is a straight actor as well as the voice of Moe, Apu, Wiggum and several others.) More clapping. But the applause is mild rather than jubilant, a far cry from speeches and champagne: The Simpsons is no stranger to awards, with 15 Emmys to date. Some mumble about whether Best Comedy might have been more apt, or Best Sitcom, but the murmuring is cut short by the cry of Ned Flanders, Homer's ultra-Christian neighbour. 'Son of a diddly!' We flick to page one. Dan Castellaneta unleashes his Emmy- winning Homer. Let the giggles commence. The new script, 'Trilogy of Error', is particularly ambitious, twice jumping back in time and using three different story viewpoints: Marge accidentally chops off Homer's thumb as he reaches for a brownie, so Homer needs to get to hospital while Lisa needs to get to school while Bart, naturally, sets up a local mobster in a fireworks sting. One scene finds Homer trying to thumb a lift without a thumb. 'That worked pretty well,' beams Scully, as everyone files out. 'I wasn't sure whether people would get into that back-in-time thing, but I was pleasantly surprised. No need for any rewrites there!'

Nine months later, it made a splash in the UK. Groening's Springfield universe is a towering creation: a rich, primary-colour dystopia blessed with an ever-burning tyre mountain and a hazardous lethal nuclear power plant. The plant is run by the billionaire Mr Burns, a feeble 104-year-old who inspires secret gay fantasies in his repressed assistant, Smithers. The corrupt womanising Mayor Quimby sounds uncannily like John F Kennedy. The school is run by a mother-obsessed school principal, the police chief is a doughnut-munching loaf and Moe, the local barman, keeps pandas in the basement.

Which explains the risqu\u00e9 gags about drunken Irishmen, rickshaw-riding Chinamen, the stereotypical Apu and Marge's smoking sisters, all of which would have risked the knife were the network permitted to pitch in. But it is also such a jokey and sophisticated show, in which the upper reaches of hilarity are speckled with erudition and belching in equal measure, that it has become something of an industry standard for sitcom writing. The pressure is on. To live up to its own reputation, each 21-minute show should work at several different levels, be an incisive, multilayered tapestry of cultural reference. As Groening puts it: 'I like to entertain people who can't read.' Little wonder that the animators, the actors, even the pizza-delivery guy all marvel at the brilliance of the writing team, how sharp, quick-witted and scholarly they are, if occasionally a tad socially aloof as a result. 'Well, there's 16 of us, all between 26 and 45 years old,' says Scully. 'There was a time when we were 90 per cent Harvard graduates, a good proportion of whom came straight from university, this was their first job. I know, it drove me crazy - I kept telling them, \"Do you realise how good it is here?\" We have a couple of stand-ups, some gag writers, sitcom writers, a former biochemist and an advertising copywriter called John Schwartzwelder who has written more than 51 of our episodes. But I get applications every day. People leave me voicemails saying, \"Hire me, I know more about it than anyone,\" which is one technique, I guess.' This morning, some 40 scripts from hopeful applicants have arrived. An acute perfectionism runs through the production process at The Simpsons, right down to the use of a 35-piece orchestra and in-house composer, one Alf Clausen, who has scored the show from the start. The writing process, certainly, obeys the mantra 'I must, I must, improve my script'. After the original submission and its brutal reworking by the team, there are several opportunities to hone, tweak or totally flip a script. First there is the table-read, then the voice parts will be recorded in a studio. Working from the script and voicetrack, the animators will prepare key shots, storyboards, new characters and scenes and at every juncture the team can either OK or red-ink the work. Which explains the scene this Friday at Film Roman, The Simpsons' huge animation studio, where an army of animators and storyboarders beaver away beneath a forest of anglepoise lamps. There is a heap of pizza boxes in the kitchen and the corridor walls are emblazoned with garish overbites and bulging eyes, an animation style we first found creepy. Unlike Garfield or the cuddly Sesame Street characters who go cross-eyed in times of trouble, Springfielders adopt the wall-eyed Marty Feldman look - from cute to hellish in a single stroke. At the end of the corridor, however, a caucus of post-production animators bite their lips and stare gloomily at the rewrites board. 'Look at what we got back from the writers the other day,' says Jim Reardon, the supervising director. 'These are rewrites that came back from the writers at Gracie [Gracie Films, the production company].' One is 15 pages long. Reardon casts a glance at his forbidding schedule, a cascade of weekly deadlines, and shrugs. This is why The Simpsons is a success. Should the writers decide that the character doesn't fit the voice, or the timing's off, or there's simply a snappier joke to tell, then the sheets go up and 80-odd animators in LA - and about 100 last-stage painters in Korea - mobilise accordingly. Far away from the quotidian labour of cartoons, as Clausen composes his scores, as the Koreans feverishly paint away, as the writers dissect another script, Groening, the master architect, ponders his invention in the table-read room at Fox Studios. ' The Simpsons was all about my underground sensibilities invading mainstream culture,' he says. 'I mean, my personal tastes are a little obscure - the last CD I bought was this Hawaiian steel-guitar album from the 20s. I find most popular culture very flat and repetitive, so often I'll see a script and I don't get some of the references, or I'm not familiar with the stars.' The show frequently features celebrity cameos - the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Martin Sheen, Jack Lemmon and 110 others over the years. 'People don't believe me, but I didn't know who U2 were before we invited them on the show. But they're exactly the guys we want to be featuring - U2, Aerosmith and Michael Jackson. That's our mission.' Groening finds no conflict in marrying mainstream culture with his own esoteric tastes. Just as he mocks the TV nation via a TV show about TV obsessives, and attacks greedy conglomerates by way of Rupert Murdoch's Fox network, he derides the current US political climate as one of bland consumption and conservatism. Yet he is happy to hire ornery republicans on to his writing team, 'because they happen to be very funny, albeit hopelessly deluded. Sure, there are contradictions - but isn't life like that?' Equally, The Simpsons reflects the common experience of muddling through shades of grey, sure that life is not a series of simple black and white choices, but still unsure of the way ahead. In many ways it is much more realistic than other TV fodder. 'At the time we came out, the overriding message of most TV comedy was that nothing matters and you're a fool for caring,' says Groening. 'We just offered a non-depressing alternative to that. And we want people to question, to read. There's a subtext going on with the show that it's OK to be smart, that if you read more books then you get more jokes. But you know what? TV is a barrage of urgent imagery and alarms interspersed with urgent imagery trying to sell you something. So, to operate in that arena, you have to be garish, bold and physical. You have to hit people over the head with physical gags. No matter how clever you are, you've got to have Homer slam into a brick wall at some point.' And he ups and leaves, all handshakes and bonhomie. What will Groening, whose love-hate relationship with television bore television's finest fruit, be watching on the small screen tonight? 'I hardly watch TV,' he grins. 'Too much else to do.' Famous fans who stays in to watch The Simpsons Glenda Jackson 'I initially watched The Simpsons because of George Bush's comment [he pledged to build an America 'less like The Simpsons and more like The Waltons '] and I catch up with it whenever I can. It really makes me laugh but it isn't all funny - some of it can be quite moving. Lisa's the little girl I would love to have been - there wasn't such a thing as feminism when I was young. Although it would be hard to pinpoint a favourite show, I love the episode when Maggie was put in the cr\u00e8che for the day and organised the Great Escape.' Damien Hirst 'My son loves it, I love it, and we can watch it together and both see something funny in it. The characters are fabulous. Plus Homer has superb underpants. I think Marge's sister, who's always smoking, is great. My favourite episode is when Homer is poisoned by eating blowfish in the Japanese restaurant.' Stephen Hawking 'The Simpsons are often cited as an example of the dumbing down of the media, but in fact they are the cleverest show on American television (not that there's much competition). I have seen for myself how much care they take with scripts, and they all have a moral. I like Lisa the best.' Charlotte Church 'My father's like Homer because of his big belly and his love of beer, and Mum's like Marge because she always moans. Even my grandfather's as mad as the Simpsons' grandfather. I find Homer the funniest, and my favourite episode is when Krusty the Clown starts his career and shares the show with Bette Midler - it was brilliant.' Melvyn Bragg 'I watch The Simpsons for the dialogue. The cartoons are OK, but the writing is terrific.' Bob Hope 'The Simpsons are my favourite family. I have loved Lisa ever since I worked with her on the show. Everybody needs a Marge in their life, and Homer will do all right. However, I'm of the opinion that Bart could use some counselling.' Tom Jones 'I'm a Simpsons fan and I was flattered when they asked me to appear in it. You never know what you're going to look like in a cartoon, but I liked my drawing (below) - they did a good job. Everybody in my house laughed like hell.' Claire Rayner 'I've always had a soft spot for Marge, partly due to Julie Kavner's voice, and also because she is amazingly tolerant and holds her whole family together. I like her ruefulness. She knows she's stuck, but she makes the best of it. The daughters come a close second. Both the guys are what you'd expect them to be, and Homer's so blissfully sure of himself.' Mel Giedroyc from comedy duo Mel and Sue 'My favourite is Marge, and I've worked out a great technique for doing her voice. Go to a rave and smoke 20 fags on the trot. Then drink five Diamond Whites. When you get home, sit in front of your open fridge and then sleep next to an open window. Set your alarm extra early and when you are rudely awakened, say, \"Oh Homey, I'm concerned about Lisa.\" The results are pretty mind-blowing.' \u0095 The Simpsons is on Sky One daily, and BBC2 on Fridays",

      "body": "<p>Two young women, both in their early twenties, and both with 10-month-old babies, recently made a joint appointment for a consultation with a cosmetic surgeon. After the birth of their babies, they had made a pact to get their bodies back in shape together. And they didn't mean swimming lessons. 'They came in for liposuction and wanted it done together, if possible,' says nurse Janice Larkin, who works at the Harley Medical Group's branch in London's Harley Street. </p> <p>It was not an unusual request. Women are saving up and making their dreams come true at any of the group's nine branches, which span the country from Leeds and Newcastle to Bath. Larkin is used to seeing friends - as well as husbands and wives - in her consulting room. It is also quite common for girlfriends to have their breasts 'done' together. </p> <p>Cosmetic surgery is becoming a way of life for an increasing number of women, who think nothing more of an appointment with their surgeon than they do of a session having their legs waxed. According to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), there are no official statistics, but it is estimated that, in 1998, 65,000 women in the UK had surgery. Mintel estimates that 72,000 procedures will take place in 2000, representing volume growth of 31 per cent on 1995. The UK market is worth at least \u00a3150m. What is for sure is that attitudes towards surgery are changing. It's not just the jet set with more time and money than brain cells who are having their faces and bodies restructured. According to this month's Company magazine, it is nurses and secretaries who are saving up the necessary \u00a34,000 for bigger breasts or a smaller bum to show off on their beach holidays. </p> <p>The Harley Medical Group alone reports a 32 per cent rise in procedures at its clinics since May 1999. The most popular treatments for women are breast surgery, facial procedures including collagen implants, Botox and eye-lifts and, of course, liposuction. Peter Coles, director of the Harley Medical Group, insists business is booming. </p> <p>'Cosmetic surgery is out of the closet,' he says. 'It is no longer a taboo subject. While women were once furtive and secretive about their visits to the cosmetic surgeon, they are now openly discussing their latest treatments over the dinner table.' </p> <p>Jo Asquith, 33, runs her own PR business in London and is typical of the way in which an increasing number of women think about their future prospects. 'I have absolutely no qualms whatsoever about having surgery,' she says. Her only treatment so far has been a Missouri skin treatment which is a bit like an acid peel. After two or three days, the top layer of your skin peels off. The skin underneath is like a baby's. 'It looks perfect, blemish-free, amazing!' she enthuses. But she is in no doubt. When she needs it doing, she'll find herself a good surgeon and have whatever it takes. 'If it gives women more confidence, then I think that's great. Look at Cher: she's incredible. She might look a bit artificial, but at least she's not old and wrinkled. How many 60-year-olds do you see looking like that?' </p> <p>And it's true. Asquith is of a generation that has grown up seeing images of high-profile, older women never appearing to get past middle age. Julie Christie, Farrah Fawcett, Iman, Liz Taylor and Goldie Hawn all have the glow of permanent middle age. Of course, the majority of photographs we see in magazines like Hello! have been retouched. But Asquith hopes to hit 40 and stay there. 'I think you have to leave it as long as possible. Once you start, it's addictive. But as long as it's safe, why not?' </p> <p>In America, women of all ages and from all walks of life are well and truly hooked on surgery. According to The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the increase in women having aesthetic surgery is phenomenal. The numbers of breast augmentations between 1992 and 1999 increased by 413 per cent, and liposuction was up 389 per cent. In last month's New York Harper's Bazaar , it was reported that the latest thing to do with your best friend is no longer shopping or a girly holiday, but sharing the experience of cosmetic surgery. 'Sharing ice- packs,' wrote Elizabeth Hayt, 'is the newest form of female bonding.' One woman took her private jet from her home in Connecticut to pick up a girlfriend in Colorado, and then on to the West Coast for a day of derma-peels, Botox, liposuction and recuperation at the luxury Carlton-Ritz Hotel, where they relaxed with Herm\u00e8s scarves tied around their heads until it was time to go home. </p> <p>Cosmetic surgery is fast becoming an extension of the high-maintenance lifestyle of busy American women who treat their appearance as a tool. 'On the East Coast, in Washington and New York, demands on business lives are greater than in the UK,' agrees Coles. 'There is a greater need to look immaculate.' Here, he says, the trend is more to do with young women fretting about the size of their bottoms, or wanting to sunbathe topless with their friends without feeling insecure about the size of their breasts. 'It's not the search for perfection,' he insists, 'but the search for normality.' </p> <p>It is not uncommon, however, for young women to turn up for their consultation with pictures torn from magazines. They'd like breasts like Gisele B\u00fcndchen's, the incredible Brazilian supermodel of the moment; they'd like an exaggerated pout like Esther Ca\u00f1adas or Hollywood star Angelina Jolie. These women all have features that, though they may be natural, look as though they have been surgically or computer-enhanced. </p> <p>No wonder collagen-enhanced lips are becoming so popular. Big lips are as fashionable as high heels, and at \u00a3165 per half syringe (the recommended dose for the newly plumped look), they are about the same price. At fashion shows, Ca\u00f1adas's lips reach the end of the catwalk a split second before she does. In the flesh, her face looks weirdly proportioned. But in 2-D, she's a hit. So is Angelina Jolie - with her B\u00e9atrice Dalle lips and super-curvy body, she's a human version of a computer-game heroine. But these three women are ideals of 21st-century perfection that cannot be underestimated. Gisele has defined the image of perfection for our times, just as skinny girls Kate Moss and Stella Tennant did five years ago, and the Amazonian Elle Macpherson and Cindy Crawford did a decade before. </p> <p>According to leading Dallas cosmetic surgeon Rod Rohrich, chair of plastic surgery at the University of Texas, it is possible to create a body like Gisele's. Techniques such as liposuction are constantly being improved. The latest progression is Ultrasound Liposuction, which makes taking out the fat easier and increases recovery time. 'You can do it to a certain extent,' he says. 'You can now truly sculpt somebody's body.' In the States, there is, he says, 'a high demand for body-sculpting surgery'. It's all to do with a booming economy, and the fact that cosmetic surgery has become so accessible. Americans, along with their Brazilian sisters, are lipo-crazy right now. Why go to the gym when you can have your fat sucked out? </p> <p>The internet has revolutionised the business, making it possible for women to find out all they need to know about a particular procedure - where to have it done and how much it costs at the click of a mouse. 'It's certainly become affordable for almost everybody,' says Rohrich. 'Cosmetic surgery is not just for the upper class or wealthy any more.' Rohrich sees patients from all over the world, including a woman from Rome who consulted him recently about having some previous work (by another surgeon) fixed. </p> <p>The numbers of women having to undergo corrective surgery after treatment are high. But that is something Rohrich predicts will change in the future. 'The Genome will totally revolutionise cosmetic surgery,' he says. 'It is very probable that within 10 years we'll be able to safely augment the female breast with the patient's own fat.' Fat is not recommended right now because it simply breaks down within the body. For bigger breasts, Rohrich and fellow doctors in the US have to make do with saline, while women outside America have access to silicone implants, too. </p> <p>Future developments mean that a small amount of fat could be removed from the body and grown to the right specifications to be inserted back into the breasts. The fat will be in such a pure form that it will grow without breaking down. Anything that's not your own tissue will eventually need to be removed and replaced because it breaks down. Traditional implants last a maximum of 15 years. As well as having more serious applications, cultured fat will be useful in face-lift surgery, too, to fill lines and wrinkles in place of the collagen and sugar-derived fillers used now. </p> <p>According to Rohrich, the Genome will eventually make scars a thing of the past, too, with scarless-wound healing. 'I would also envisage a lot of surgery with remote-control and computer,' he says. The idea is that women will be able to use virtual reality to see exactly how their new cheeks, breasts or lips will look. Once they've played with their very own 3-D Lara Croft character on screen, they will then be able to have more accurate implants made, following the precise contours of their bodies. </p> <p>Another of Rohrich's ideas is that women will be able to experience their new bodies by putting on body suits, goggles and special sensory gloves so that they will actually be able to feel their new shape. And the surgery itself could be carried out by robots, via remote control, allowing specialists to operate on women hundreds of miles away, or even in another country. It all seems like science fiction. But then so does the reality of plastic surgery today. Frankenstein's monster? He's no longer a figment of the imagination. </p> <p>Still, it all takes a bit of getting used to. When I make an appointment to have a chat with a consultant at the Harley Medical Group's London headquarters, I am asked if I would like any treatments. All very matter of fact. Like what, I ask. 'You could have a Botox. It's quite quick.' I politely but firmly refuse. No, I would not like to have a syringe of purified botulism injected into my forehead tomorrow afternoon. Thanks for the offer, but no. 'Do you have a friend who would like a treatment?' No, not on such short notice. </p> <p>Call me so 20th century, but the thought of having an injection into my forehead, even if it does iron out wrinkles like a steam press, makes me go a little wobbly at the knees. Give me virtual reality any day. But as I put down the phone, I realise that I am in a minority. Plastic surgery hasn't quite taken off to the same extremes here as it has in America. But I know several friends and relatives who would love a treatment. I would only have to say the word and they would be in the surgery's waiting room in a flash, eager to have their wrinkles and lines zapped away like magic. </p> <p>And why not? As the woman on the phone said, it doesn't take long and really isn't painful. You can have it done in your lunch hour, and be back at your desk in the afternoon looking as though you have just been for a quick dip in the fountain of youth. It's all part of a new culture that treats cosmetic surgery as an extension of more traditional beauty therapies. A cut and blow dry, a manicure, a session on the sunbed, an eyeliner tattoo and a strip of Gore-Tex threaded into your lips for a Paris pout. As Peter Coles says, it's all out of the closet. </p> <p>There are two twentysomething men in the Harley Street waiting room when I visit, along with a gorgeous-looking blonde. I try not to stare, but can't resist giving them a once-over to guess what they are all in for. Downstairs in her small consulting room, Janice Larkin is a pretty, youthful-looking Irish woman in her thirties, who used to work with sick babies in Hammersmith and moved into cosmetic surgery because she wanted to do something that required a little less of her emotionally. As one surgeon says, cosmetic surgery is happy medicine. </p> <p>Larkin says she hasn't been able to resist a bit of gentle restructuring herself. She's currently undergoing a course of Botox injections to relax her overactive forehead. 'It's a low-cost procedure and very accessible,' she says. All it takes is five to 10 minutes for a series of injections to the brow area and, within a week, your forehead is visibly smoother. 'It stings a little bit and is a little bit pink afterwards,' she adds, her trained eye honing in on my own worry lines, which are getting deeper by the minute. 'But it's a preventative.' </p> <p>I am left feeling that if I don't have my lines Botox'd, it would be the equivalent of not shaving my armpits and letting the hairs grow on my legs; I'll look ungroomed and unsightly. Still, there is hope. I don't need my naso-labial lines doing - they are the lines that run from your nose to either side of your mouth. Larkin had hers injected with collagen, just one of a range of dermal fillers on the market designed to plump up the skin and fill in the lines. </p> <p>Restylane is the latest wonder-filler: it is 100 per cent synthetic and has instant results. Despite the fact that cosmetic surgery is increasingly accessible, it is still very expensive. If I were to succumb to the Botox injection, it would set me back \u00a3350 for the initial treatment, and then I'd need a \u00a3250 top-up every three to six months for up to three years. That's around \u00a33,000 for the full course. But women are happy to save up, or even take out a bank loan, as they might for a car. 'There is a change in the type of client we have been seeing,' says Larkin. 'We're getting more women who feel they deserve a treat. The Englishwoman is becoming very high maintenance. Some want the perfect shape, but that's a minority. We encourage a healthy approach.' All liposuction can do, she says, is enhance an existing body structure. It can't miraculously transform you. </p> <p>Unrealistic expectations are not encouraged, although French, Italian and Brazilian women tend to be much more critical of themselves and their daughters, who are often launched into a life of nips, tucks and artificial beauty on their 21st birthdays. For a few women, it's an all-consuming passion. They assess their body much more critically. </p> <p>Soon there will come a time when cosmetic surgery and traditional beauty therapies will meet. At the Institut Beaut\u00e9 on New York's Park Avenue, this has already happened. Clients can pop in between meetings for a bit of laser-hair removal, a chemical peel or, if they have $400 to spare, a new laser treatment that promotes collagen growth on the ball of the foot. The idea is that collagen forms a soft pad so that wearing your Manolos is more comfortable. Rumour has it that American Vogue 's Anna Wintour is a customer. And over at the J Sisters hair-removal salon, Naomi Campbell is said to have invested in a new set of luscious lashes, which are actually grafted to the roots of her own. They last from 10 days to a month. </p> <p>One British woman in her thirties swears by her trips to a South African beauty spa, where she can go and actually enjoy her treatments. Why not have a face-peel or an Endermologie (a combination of massage and suction for the reduction of cellulite) just as you might pamper yourself with a massage and a facial? </p> <p>The gap between beauty salon and surgery is certainly closing in. Quick lunchtime fixes are already a reality at the Harley Medical Group's City branch, where increasing numbers of middle-aged businessmen are going to have the bags under their eyes removed to stop them looking old and stressed in the workplace. And there is an increase, too, in non-surgical face-lifts, at beauty salons such as Escape, in Clerkenwell. The salon will be the first in London to use a new Lift and Tone machine, which runs an electrical current through special pads on the therapist's fingers so she can accurately firm up muscles and skin tone on the body. </p> <p>Already, Saturdays are booked up with women having CACI (Computer Aided Cosmotology Instrument) treatment, which has the same effect. Some of their clients have had surgery as well, including a 31-year-old who has just had her brows lifted. 'If a woman wants to go and have surgery, I don't think there's anything wrong with it,' says Maria Kourpas, head therapist. She believes the same result can be achieved with clever use of make-up and non-surgical treatments. If you start young, by the time you get to 50, you're going to look so much better. </p> <p>Meanwhile, over in Miami, Thomas Baker, MD, who is a dab hand with the scalpel, has come up with a clever non-surgical idea. It's still in the preliminary stages of development and is unlikely to be on the market before 2001, but it's a bra that uses suction to increase the size of breasts without the need of implants. It is designed literally to pump up the breasts and would be worn, it seems, as you would a brace on the teeth. It'll give a whole new meaning to the term blow-up doll.</p>",

But Asquith hopes to hit 40 and stay there. 'I think you have to leave it as long as possible. Once you start, it's addictive. But as long as it's safe, why not?' In America, women of all ages and from all walks of life are well and truly hooked on surgery. According to The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the increase in women having aesthetic surgery is phenomenal. The numbers of breast augmentations between 1992 and 1999 increased by 413 per cent, and liposuction was up 389 per cent. In last month's New York Harper's Bazaar , it was reported that the latest thing to do with your best friend is no longer shopping or a girly holiday, but sharing the experience of cosmetic surgery. 'Sharing ice- packs,' wrote Elizabeth Hayt, 'is the newest form of female bonding.' One woman took her private jet from her home in Connecticut to pick up a girlfriend in Colorado, and then on to the West Coast for a day of derma-peels, Botox, liposuction and recuperation at the luxury Carlton-Ritz Hotel, where they relaxed with Herm\u00e8s scarves tied around their heads until it was time to go home. Cosmetic surgery is fast becoming an extension of the high-maintenance lifestyle of busy American women who treat their appearance as a tool. 'On the East Coast, in Washington and New York, demands on business lives are greater than in the UK,' agrees Coles. 'There is a greater need to look immaculate.' Here, he says, the trend is more to do with young women fretting about the size of their bottoms, or wanting to sunbathe topless with their friends without feeling insecure about the size of their breasts. 'It's not the search for perfection,' he insists, 'but the search for normality.' It is not uncommon, however, for young women to turn up for their consultation with pictures torn from magazines. They'd like breasts like Gisele B\u00fcndchen's, the incredible Brazilian supermodel of the moment; they'd like an exaggerated pout like Esther Ca\u00f1adas or Hollywood star Angelina Jolie. These women all have features that, though they may be natural, look as though they have been surgically or computer-enhanced. No wonder collagen-enhanced lips are becoming so popular. Big lips are as fashionable as high heels, and at \u00a3165 per half syringe (the recommended dose for the newly plumped look), they are about the same price. At fashion shows, Ca\u00f1adas's lips reach the end of the catwalk a split second before she does. In the flesh, her face looks weirdly proportioned. But in 2-D, she's a hit. So is Angelina Jolie - with her B\u00e9atrice Dalle lips and super-curvy body, she's a human version of a computer-game heroine. But these three women are ideals of 21st-century perfection that cannot be underestimated. Gisele has defined the image of perfection for our times, just as skinny girls Kate Moss and Stella Tennant did five years ago, and the Amazonian Elle Macpherson and Cindy Crawford did a decade before. According to leading Dallas cosmetic surgeon Rod Rohrich, chair of plastic surgery at the University of Texas, it is possible to create a body like Gisele's. Techniques such as liposuction are constantly being improved. The latest progression is Ultrasound Liposuction, which makes taking out the fat easier and increases recovery time. 'You can do it to a certain extent,' he says. 'You can now truly sculpt somebody's body.' In the States, there is, he says, 'a high demand for body-sculpting surgery'. It's all to do with a booming economy, and the fact that cosmetic surgery has become so accessible. Americans, along with their Brazilian sisters, are lipo-crazy right now. Why go to the gym when you can have your fat sucked out? The internet has revolutionised the business, making it possible for women to find out all they need to know about a particular procedure - where to have it done and how much it costs at the click of a mouse. 'It's certainly become affordable for almost everybody,' says Rohrich. 'Cosmetic surgery is not just for the upper class or wealthy any more.' Rohrich sees patients from all over the world, including a woman from Rome who consulted him recently about having some previous work (by another surgeon) fixed. The numbers of women having to undergo corrective surgery after treatment are high. But that is something Rohrich predicts will change in the future. 'The Genome will totally revolutionise cosmetic surgery,' he says. 'It is very probable that within 10 years we'll be able to safely augment the female breast with the patient's own fat.' Fat is not recommended right now because it simply breaks down within the body. For bigger breasts, Rohrich and fellow doctors in the US have to make do with saline, while women outside America have access to silicone implants, too. Future developments mean that a small amount of fat could be removed from the body and grown to the right specifications to be inserted back into the breasts. The fat will be in such a pure form that it will grow without breaking down. Anything that's not your own tissue will eventually need to be removed and replaced because it breaks down. Traditional implants last a maximum of 15 years. As well as having more serious applications, cultured fat will be useful in face-lift surgery, too, to fill lines and wrinkles in place of the collagen and sugar-derived fillers used now. According to Rohrich, the Genome will eventually make scars a thing of the past, too, with scarless-wound healing. 'I would also envisage a lot of surgery with remote-control and computer,' he says. The idea is that women will be able to use virtual reality to see exactly how their new cheeks, breasts or lips will look. Once they've played with their very own 3-D Lara Croft character on screen, they will then be able to have more accurate implants made, following the precise contours of their bodies. Another of Rohrich's ideas is that women will be able to experience their new bodies by putting on body suits, goggles and special sensory gloves so that they will actually be able to feel their new shape. And the surgery itself could be carried out by robots, via remote control, allowing specialists to operate on women hundreds of miles away, or even in another country. It all seems like science fiction. But then so does the reality of plastic surgery today. Frankenstein's monster? He's no longer a figment of the imagination. Still, it all takes a bit of getting used to. When I make an appointment to have a chat with a consultant at the Harley Medical Group's London headquarters, I am asked if I would like any treatments. All very matter of fact. Like what, I ask. 'You could have a Botox. It's quite quick.' I politely but firmly refuse. No, I would not like to have a syringe of purified botulism injected into my forehead tomorrow afternoon. Thanks for the offer, but no. 'Do you have a friend who would like a treatment?' No, not on such short notice. Call me so 20th century, but the thought of having an injection into my forehead, even if it does iron out wrinkles like a steam press, makes me go a little wobbly at the knees. Give me virtual reality any day. But as I put down the phone, I realise that I am in a minority. Plastic surgery hasn't quite taken off to the same extremes here as it has in America. But I know several friends and relatives who would love a treatment. I would only have to say the word and they would be in the surgery's waiting room in a flash, eager to have their wrinkles and lines zapped away like magic. And why not? As the woman on the phone said, it doesn't take long and really isn't painful. You can have it done in your lunch hour, and be back at your desk in the afternoon looking as though you have just been for a quick dip in the fountain of youth. It's all part of a new culture that treats cosmetic surgery as an extension of more traditional beauty therapies. A cut and blow dry, a manicure, a session on the sunbed, an eyeliner tattoo and a strip of Gore-Tex threaded into your lips for a Paris pout. As Peter Coles says, it's all out of the closet. There are two twentysomething men in the Harley Street waiting room when I visit, along with a gorgeous-looking blonde. I try not to stare, but can't resist giving them a once-over to guess what they are all in for. Downstairs in her small consulting room, Janice Larkin is a pretty, youthful-looking Irish woman in her thirties, who used to work with sick babies in Hammersmith and moved into cosmetic surgery because she wanted to do something that required a little less of her emotionally. As one surgeon says, cosmetic surgery is happy medicine. Larkin says she hasn't been able to resist a bit of gentle restructuring herself. She's currently undergoing a course of Botox injections to relax her overactive forehead. 'It's a low-cost procedure and very accessible,' she says. All it takes is five to 10 minutes for a series of injections to the brow area and, within a week, your forehead is visibly smoother. 'It stings a little bit and is a little bit pink afterwards,' she adds, her trained eye honing in on my own worry lines, which are getting deeper by the minute. 'But it's a preventative.' I am left feeling that if I don't have my lines Botox'd, it would be the equivalent of not shaving my armpits and letting the hairs grow on my legs; I'll look ungroomed and unsightly. Still, there is hope. I don't need my naso-labial lines doing - they are the lines that run from your nose to either side of your mouth. Larkin had hers injected with collagen, just one of a range of dermal fillers on the market designed to plump up the skin and fill in the lines. Restylane is the latest wonder-filler: it is 100 per cent synthetic and has instant results. Despite the fact that cosmetic surgery is increasingly accessible, it is still very expensive. If I were to succumb to the Botox injection, it would set me back \u00a3350 for the initial treatment, and then I'd need a \u00a3250 top-up every three to six months for up to three years. That's around \u00a33,000 for the full course. But women are happy to save up, or even take out a bank loan, as they might for a car. 'There is a change in the type of client we have been seeing,' says Larkin. 'We're getting more women who feel they deserve a treat. The Englishwoman is becoming very high maintenance. Some want the perfect shape, but that's a minority. We encourage a healthy approach.' All liposuction can do, she says, is enhance an existing body structure. It can't miraculously transform you. Unrealistic expectations are not encouraged, although French, Italian and Brazilian women tend to be much more critical of themselves and their daughters, who are often launched into a life of nips, tucks and artificial beauty on their 21st birthdays. For a few women, it's an all-consuming passion. They assess their body much more critically. Soon there will come a time when cosmetic surgery and traditional beauty therapies will meet. At the Institut Beaut\u00e9 on New York's Park Avenue, this has already happened. Clients can pop in between meetings for a bit of laser-hair removal, a chemical peel or, if they have $400 to spare, a new laser treatment that promotes collagen growth on the ball of the foot. The idea is that collagen forms a soft pad so that wearing your Manolos is more comfortable. Rumour has it that American Vogue 's Anna Wintour is a customer. And over at the J Sisters hair-removal salon, Naomi Campbell is said to have invested in a new set of luscious lashes, which are actually grafted to the roots of her own. They last from 10 days to a month. One British woman in her thirties swears by her trips to a South African beauty spa, where she can go and actually enjoy her treatments. Why not have a face-peel or an Endermologie (a combination of massage and suction for the reduction of cellulite) just as you might pamper yourself with a massage and a facial? The gap between beauty salon and surgery is certainly closing in. Quick lunchtime fixes are already a reality at the Harley Medical Group's City branch, where increasing numbers of middle-aged businessmen are going to have the bags under their eyes removed to stop them looking old and stressed in the workplace. And there is an increase, too, in non-surgical face-lifts, at beauty salons such as Escape, in Clerkenwell. The salon will be the first in London to use a new Lift and Tone machine, which runs an electrical current through special pads on the therapist's fingers so she can accurately firm up muscles and skin tone on the body. Already, Saturdays are booked up with women having CACI (Computer Aided Cosmotology Instrument) treatment, which has the same effect. Some of their clients have had surgery as well, including a 31-year-old who has just had her brows lifted. 'If a woman wants to go and have surgery, I don't think there's anything wrong with it,' says Maria Kourpas, head therapist. She believes the same result can be achieved with clever use of make-up and non-surgical treatments. If you start young, by the time you get to 50, you're going to look so much better. Meanwhile, over in Miami, Thomas Baker, MD, who is a dab hand with the scalpel, has come up with a clever non-surgical idea. It's still in the preliminary stages of development and is unlikely to be on the market before 2001, but it's a bra that uses suction to increase the size of breasts without the need of implants. It is designed literally to pump up the breasts and would be worn, it seems, as you would a brace on the teeth. It'll give a whole new meaning to the term blow-up doll.",

The only possible way to struggle to the end of such drivel was to carry a check list of five very obvious points somewhere near the back of one's mind and read on in the hope that the hack for the day would compile a nap hand. </p> <p>The royal straight flush of country-bollocks writing runs as follows: </p> <p>1) The Tube is nasty, vicious and late. </p> <p>Counter-play: Try getting a bus in Lincolnshire. </p> <p>2) London is violent and occupied by psychopaths. </p> <p>Counter-play: Tony Martin. </p> <p>3) The country delights to cuckoos chirruping at six in the morning. </p> <p>Counter-play: What's a cuckoo and when's 6am? </p> <p>4) The schools in the country provide a first-rate education. </p> <p>Counter-play: Name one Nobel prize winner educated on the Isle of Wight. </p> <p>5) Children are happier in the country, gambolling through the green and promised land, blah, blah, blah. </p> <p>Counter-play: Hyde Park, Richmond Park, Belsize Park, Upton Park... blah, blah, blah. </p> <p>Suffice to say, you wouldn't want to play poker against a country-bollocks writer as they always ended up with nap hands. I would chuckle inwardly as they filled their royal straight flushes until... until... I had to face up to the fact that by the end of this month I will be living in... Norfolk. </p> <p>Even now, two weeks from Norfolk, I'm not entirely sure how this came to pass. I do, however, have a hazy idea about the moment everything started to go awry. Last December, Fred, then Daisy, and then Grainne, contracted chicken pox. Next up was Little Mo, who got it so bad that, well, put it this way, you didn't have to queue in Putney if you had Mo in your arms. The net effect of all this pox was to transform our plush-ish Putney flat into a Crimean hospital waiting for Florence Nightingale to arrive. Despite the cold, it was fetid, cramped and close. </p> <p>Happily, we all survived - although if I'd got it, who knows? - but the scars stayed scabby. Gron, for one, became fixated by Space.

      "bodyText": "How I yawned as this or that hack banged on in this or that newspaper about why the time was ripe for them to forsake London and embrace the country. The only possible way to struggle to the end of such drivel was to carry a check list of five very obvious points somewhere near the back of one's mind and read on in the hope that the hack for the day would compile a nap hand. The royal straight flush of country-bollocks writing runs as follows: 1) The Tube is nasty, vicious and late. Counter-play: Try getting a bus in Lincolnshire. 2) London is violent and occupied by psychopaths. Counter-play: Tony Martin. 3) The country delights to cuckoos chirruping at six in the morning. Counter-play: What's a cuckoo and when's 6am? 4) The schools in the country provide a first-rate education. Counter-play: Name one Nobel prize winner educated on the Isle of Wight. 5) Children are happier in the country, gambolling through the green and promised land, blah, blah, blah. Counter-play: Hyde Park, Richmond Park, Belsize Park, Upton Park... blah, blah, blah. Suffice to say, you wouldn't want to play poker against a country-bollocks writer as they always ended up with nap hands. I would chuckle inwardly as they filled their royal straight flushes until... until... I had to face up to the fact that by the end of this month I will be living in... Norfolk. Even now, two weeks from Norfolk, I'm not entirely sure how this came to pass. I do, however, have a hazy idea about the moment everything started to go awry. Last December, Fred, then Daisy, and then Grainne, contracted chicken pox. Next up was Little Mo, who got it so bad that, well, put it this way, you didn't have to queue in Putney if you had Mo in your arms. The net effect of all this pox was to transform our plush-ish Putney flat into a Crimean hospital waiting for Florence Nightingale to arrive. Despite the cold, it was fetid, cramped and close. Happily, we all survived - although if I'd got it, who knows? - but the scars stayed scabby. Gron, for one, became fixated by Space.

For 20 years, this Cornish-based company has been packing in audiences. But it's not exactly a case of full houses; Kneehigh's gift is for making dramas out of seascapes and landscapes. </p> <p>It has staged shows in abandoned tin-mines, deserted arsenic works and at the Minack, an amphitheatre overlooking the Atlantic near Land's End, where actors learn to pause as the audience spot dolphins leaping behind them. Later this month, it's enlisting the help of local bikers to put on Hell's Mouth - a version of Antigone which involves Samurai stunt-bikes - in a partly flooded clay-pit near St Austell. </p> <p>Kneehigh does not supplant the traditional function of a local rep. It originates its own work; its style is strongly marked by music hall and cabaret, sometimes by a hurdy-gurdy boisterousness. Some shows are site-specific; some tour. Most of them are out-of-doors; all of them alter according to their surroundings. </p> <p>This year, Emma Rice's adaptation of <strong> The Red Shoes</strong>, which she also directs, drew 600 people into the luxuriant Heligan Gardens. They sat on the grass or on bales of straw as wind shook the rhododendrons. And they saw a play that echoed with the strangeness of gardens that contain jungles and grottoes and pineapple pits - which are both beguiling and untamed. </p> <p>Four men and a woman - one a feathered, cawing drag-queen, the others appearing in Y-fronts - perform the fairy story about a girl whose magic shoes give her the gift of dance, which turns out to be a curse. They strum on banjo, accordion, trombone and washboard. They mime to blasts of Tannh\u00e4user.

      "bodyText": "The Red Shoes Heligan Gardens, Pentewan, Cornwall Moby Dick Torquay Circus Oz Sadler's Wells, London EC1 Anyone who thinks that, away from London, theatre is doomed, should consider the case of Kneehigh. For 20 years, this Cornish-based company has been packing in audiences. But it's not exactly a case of full houses; Kneehigh's gift is for making dramas out of seascapes and landscapes. It has staged shows in abandoned tin-mines, deserted arsenic works and at the Minack, an amphitheatre overlooking the Atlantic near Land's End, where actors learn to pause as the audience spot dolphins leaping behind them. Later this month, it's enlisting the help of local bikers to put on Hell's Mouth - a version of Antigone which involves Samurai stunt-bikes - in a partly flooded clay-pit near St Austell. Kneehigh does not supplant the traditional function of a local rep. It originates its own work; its style is strongly marked by music hall and cabaret, sometimes by a hurdy-gurdy boisterousness. Some shows are site-specific; some tour. Most of them are out-of-doors; all of them alter according to their surroundings. This year, Emma Rice's adaptation of The Red Shoes, which she also directs, drew 600 people into the luxuriant Heligan Gardens. They sat on the grass or on bales of straw as wind shook the rhododendrons. And they saw a play that echoed with the strangeness of gardens that contain jungles and grottoes and pineapple pits - which are both beguiling and untamed. Four men and a woman - one a feathered, cawing drag-queen, the others appearing in Y-fronts - perform the fairy story about a girl whose magic shoes give her the gift of dance, which turns out to be a curse. They strum on banjo, accordion, trombone and washboard. They mime to blasts of Tannh\u00e4user. And they speak sharp verses by Anna-Maria Murphy. The fairy tale carries a mixed message about the exhilaration and the punishment of obsession. Rice's production doesn't make this clearer, but it makes it pungent. It's a giddy and grisly evening, sometimes a gorgeous one. Lights wheel over the stage as the girl is pursued by her demonic and bloody dancing shoes - in fact, her chopped-off feet - their shorn-off tops streaming with scarlet ribbons.

Led by a middle-aged, rather dumpy woman, they made their way up Broad Way for a short distance and then turned into Queen (now Pearl) Street. There, their unlikely leader went up to a woman sitting outside her house, sunning herself in the evening light and announced in her distinctive, blunt tones 'that an angel had told her to come to this very house, where she would be taken in'. Unquestioning in the face of such conviction, the woman and her husband welcomed Ann Lee and her followers, and the story of Shakerism in America began. </p> <p> Ann the Word is the first biography of Ann Lee, the remarkable woman who led a tiny band of followers to America and founded a religious movement that, at her death 10 years later, probably numbered a thousand, and at its peak the next century had perhaps four times that. Ann was born in 1736 in Manchester. Her father was a blacksmith. Their family was poor but not destitute; Ann was illiterate but probably not hungry. In 1762, she married a blacksmith; the couple had four children, all of whom died in childhood. But the most important event in Ann Lee's early life was when, aged 22, she joined a small religious sect that had broken away from the Society of Friends, or Quakers, nine years before. </p> <p>By the 1740s, the Quakers had stopped worshipping God with the violent trembling and quaking from which they derived their nickname. The Shakers retained this direct, intense form of communication with God. They sang, shouted, walked about 'like clouds agitated by a mighty wind', and even 'shoved each other about' as they prayed, writhing, groaning and swinging their arms like windmills. Other tenets of their faith included pacifism, celibacy and simplicity in all things, hence the furniture. Uniformly short hair and plain clothes created an almost tribal identity. On joining the group, the initiate was required to confess all past sins; then, newly pure, he or she was ready for life without sin in the Shaker community. </p> <p>Twelve years after Ann Lee joined the Shakers, she experienced what she described as a spiritual rebirth. She was now, she said, Ann the Word. Immediately, she took over the group's leadership, and was thenceforth addressed as Mother. Ann Lee's commonplace exterior belied her charisma and intuition. Despite the obstacles she faced, including beatings, incarceration and accusations of witchcraft, heresy and spying, she formed around herself a coherent, devoted group of converts. </p> <p>To her followers, Ann was 'an image of Christ displayed in human clay'. The nature of the religion she shaped was as extraordinary as Ann herself. Because she and her followers 'believed history was coming to an end', they made no provision for the future, either their own or that of the group; their beliefs are frozen in their time. God was an almost palpable presence: Ann described dust motes caught in light as 'specks of angels' wings' and she meant that literally. </p> <p>When they landed in New York, Ann and her followers entered a spiritually loaded atmosphere, an 'environment saturated with religious enthusiasm'. Since the first settlers had arrived in New England early the previous century, immigrants to the New World had been attracted by the idea of religious tolerance there. In 1741, the Reverend Jonathan Edwards preached his famous sermon, 'Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,' which set the tone for the Great Awakening. By the 1770s, this fervour had died down, but revolutionary America was still a land obsessed by the concepts of sin and salvation, a land, one might say, ripe for a woman like Ann the Word. </p> <p>Although the only surviving thing that can be traced to Ann herself is the 'x' with which she marked the register when she got married, Richard Francis has created through the words of her followers (and detractors) a credible and compelling image of this shadowy, shining woman and the God-fearing, God-obsessed world in which she lived.</p>",

But the most important event in Ann Lee's early life was when, aged 22, she joined a small religious sect that had broken away from the Society of Friends, or Quakers, nine years before. By the 1740s, the Quakers had stopped worshipping God with the violent trembling and quaking from which they derived their nickname. The Shakers retained this direct, intense form of communication with God. They sang, shouted, walked about 'like clouds agitated by a mighty wind', and even 'shoved each other about' as they prayed, writhing, groaning and swinging their arms like windmills. Other tenets of their faith included pacifism, celibacy and simplicity in all things, hence the furniture. Uniformly short hair and plain clothes created an almost tribal identity. On joining the group, the initiate was required to confess all past sins; then, newly pure, he or she was ready for life without sin in the Shaker community. Twelve years after Ann Lee joined the Shakers, she experienced what she described as a spiritual rebirth. She was now, she said, Ann the Word. Immediately, she took over the group's leadership, and was thenceforth addressed as Mother. Ann Lee's commonplace exterior belied her charisma and intuition. Despite the obstacles she faced, including beatings, incarceration and accusations of witchcraft, heresy and spying, she formed around herself a coherent, devoted group of converts. To her followers, Ann was 'an image of Christ displayed in human clay'. The nature of the religion she shaped was as extraordinary as Ann herself. Because she and her followers 'believed history was coming to an end', they made no provision for the future, either their own or that of the group; their beliefs are frozen in their time. God was an almost palpable presence: Ann described dust motes caught in light as 'specks of angels' wings' and she meant that literally. When they landed in New York, Ann and her followers entered a spiritually loaded atmosphere, an 'environment saturated with religious enthusiasm'. Since the first settlers had arrived in New England early the previous century, immigrants to the New World had been attracted by the idea of religious tolerance there. In 1741, the Reverend Jonathan Edwards preached his famous sermon, 'Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,' which set the tone for the Great Awakening. By the 1770s, this fervour had died down, but revolutionary America was still a land obsessed by the concepts of sin and salvation, a land, one might say, ripe for a woman like Ann the Word. Although the only surviving thing that can be traced to Ann herself is the 'x' with which she marked the register when she got married, Richard Francis has created through the words of her followers (and detractors) a credible and compelling image of this shadowy, shining woman and the God-fearing, God-obsessed world in which she lived.",

The wicket is a good one and lo and behold we will witness a five-day game. </p> <p>Cautious English players mouthed the truisms on Friday night: 'This is a five-day match, there's a lot of cricket left in this game.' Uncomfortably that reality was brought home in the final session with piercing clarity as three batsmen in distinctly contrasting styles combated the English attack with grit and gusto. Adrian Griffith, seemingly so frail in technique, concentrated furiously for 48 overs and 41 runs; Sherwin Campbell, impishly driving square of the wicket, completed a fine half-century until a vicious lifter from Craig White was parried to point. And in the closing overs Wavell Hinds hooked and pulled boundaries off White and Gough with such authority that he seemed to be issuing a Caribbean statement of intent: this match ain't over yet. </p> <p>Apart from a couple of hostile overs from White the English bowlers rarely threatened.

Indeed Michael Vaughan with a typically diligent 29 was England's highest scorer yesterday. Stewart, so mesmeric on Friday, went in mundane fashion, nibbling at the second ball of the day from Ambrose to give a straightforward catch behind the wicket. Quite properly Stewart's hundred in his hundredth Test match had dominated the morning's headlines. He had batted brilliantly. However, Trescothick's innings, which ended when he was bowled off his pads by Walsh after 25 minutes play, is probably more significant in the long run. </p> <p>The selectors did well to pick him. One of the Sunday press box sages declared that it would be 'pure foolishness' to select Trescothick for a Test match ( I won't tell you who since I dislike the current trend of naming and shaming, though it wasn't his current opening partner). This judgment had been reached after watching Trescothick score runs in his first outing in the one-day series. Presumably it was forgotten that quality cricketers are capable of adjusting their game depending on the type of match they are playing in. </p> <p>In the one day games Trescothick flirted outside the off-stump quite frequently (you can't really leave too many deliveries in a 50 over match). Here at Old Trafford the quality of his strokeplay was striking - especially for those wise men who have only seen him in bat in blue this year. But most impressive was his judgment of what to leave outside his off-stump, something that he had practised quietly at Taunton a week before his Test appearance. Trescothick has ability, a sound temperament and an alert cricket brain. He could be around for some time. It would not be so foolish for the selectors to pencil him in for the winter tours. </p> <p>England never really recovered from the loss of both of Saturday's heroes. The West Indies prospered partly because their support bowlers were more reliable. Reon King, in particular has had his confidence dented but he can bowl sharply and it was his pace that accounted for Craig White. The bat was still on the way down when his off-stump was dislodged. White the bowler looks far more convincing at this level than White the batsman. Dominic Cork bristled as usual; even so it took him 15 balls to get off the mark and this was when Rose presented him with a juicy long hop. This was crashed to point, England's first boundary in 85 minutes of play. </p> <p>Cork scored 16 and was starting to unsettle the West Indians when he sparred at Ambrose and edged to Jacobs. All the while Vaughan had been assured but fairly easily shackled at the other end, his bat straight, his defence sound. On 25 he should have been sent on his way when Walsh delivered another of his deadly slower balls. Vaughan lost it and was struck on the front leg. Unaccountably Umpire Willey rejected Walsh's appeal. But it was not an expensive aberration.

      "body": "<p>We are now reaching the business end of the first season of central contracts and a two-division championship, and things seem to be working out. </p> <p>The most important thing in English cricket is the England team and the whole structure must be designed around producing a national side that can take on the best in the world. If Duncan Fletcher wants to pull the England players out of the climax of the Championship then he should be supported as he is doing what is right for England. </p> <p>The counties may get upset if they lose players to England but that is just bad luck. It's always been the same. The counties are businesses and they are compensated when they suffer international call-ups. They want to show a profit at the end of the year so they shouldn't really grumble too much when centrally contracted players aren't available too them. </p> <p>I felt at the start of the year that too many contracts were awarded, five would have been fine. A central contract is something that should be strived for and only awarded to the cream of the crop. Nasser Hussain, Michael Atherton, Alec Stewart, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick should have been the chosen few but if the England management had wanted to pull any other player from any domestic game they should be perfectly entitled to do so. </p> <p>What the contracts do instil is strong team spirit. The more the national team are together the stronger they will become and that has to be a good thing. Australia and South Africa have proved that. </p> <p>An average eleven who play together as a unit will usually get the better of a more talented side who don't. The importance of this is not lost on Duncan Fletcher and he knows that if the game is to flourish in this country then the success of England in international cricket is vital. The two-division championship has certainly had the desired effect. In years gone by the amount of dead matches as the season wound down was staggering and produced some very uninspiring cricket. </p> <p>The advent of promotion and relegation has meant that 'nothing' games are few and far between and almost every match has an edge to it. This means that players are experiencing a lot more competitive cricket and that will help their development as their careers progress. </p> <p>In the past there has been far too much soft cricket played in this country and that clearly hindered progress. Top players are the ones who respond to a challenge and raise their game when required. It appears to me that two divisions may go a long way to preventing staleness and will eventually contribute to further strengthening the England team. </p> <p>This season has again proved the importance of having a proven matchwinner in your side. Last year we saw what Muttiah Muralitharan and Saqlain Mushtaq did for Lancashire and Surrey respectively and in the past Warwickshire benefited hugely from having Brian Lara in the side when he was at the very top of game. </p> <p>Saqlain is doing it again for Surrey this term and is helped out by a batting line-up that regularly put scores in excess of 300 on the board. This gives him plenty to bowl at and is the bedrock of Surrey's success. They look to be in a very strong position to retain their title. </p> <p>When Courtney Walsh was at Gloucestershire he never really received the support from his batsmen that his efforts deserved.

      "bodyText": "We are now reaching the business end of the first season of central contracts and a two-division championship, and things seem to be working out. The most important thing in English cricket is the England team and the whole structure must be designed around producing a national side that can take on the best in the world. If Duncan Fletcher wants to pull the England players out of the climax of the Championship then he should be supported as he is doing what is right for England. The counties may get upset if they lose players to England but that is just bad luck. It's always been the same. The counties are businesses and they are compensated when they suffer international call-ups. They want to show a profit at the end of the year so they shouldn't really grumble too much when centrally contracted players aren't available too them. I felt at the start of the year that too many contracts were awarded, five would have been fine. A central contract is something that should be strived for and only awarded to the cream of the crop. Nasser Hussain, Michael Atherton, Alec Stewart, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick should have been the chosen few but if the England management had wanted to pull any other player from any domestic game they should be perfectly entitled to do so. What the contracts do instil is strong team spirit. The more the national team are together the stronger they will become and that has to be a good thing. Australia and South Africa have proved that. An average eleven who play together as a unit will usually get the better of a more talented side who don't. The importance of this is not lost on Duncan Fletcher and he knows that if the game is to flourish in this country then the success of England in international cricket is vital. The two-division championship has certainly had the desired effect. In years gone by the amount of dead matches as the season wound down was staggering and produced some very uninspiring cricket. The advent of promotion and relegation has meant that 'nothing' games are few and far between and almost every match has an edge to it. This means that players are experiencing a lot more competitive cricket and that will help their development as their careers progress. In the past there has been far too much soft cricket played in this country and that clearly hindered progress. Top players are the ones who respond to a challenge and raise their game when required. It appears to me that two divisions may go a long way to preventing staleness and will eventually contribute to further strengthening the England team. This season has again proved the importance of having a proven matchwinner in your side. Last year we saw what Muttiah Muralitharan and Saqlain Mushtaq did for Lancashire and Surrey respectively and in the past Warwickshire benefited hugely from having Brian Lara in the side when he was at the very top of game. Saqlain is doing it again for Surrey this term and is helped out by a batting line-up that regularly put scores in excess of 300 on the board. This gives him plenty to bowl at and is the bedrock of Surrey's success. They look to be in a very strong position to retain their title. When Courtney Walsh was at Gloucestershire he never really received the support from his batsmen that his efforts deserved. A similar thing is now happening to him with the West Indies. This provides a great chance for an England team that is heading in the right direction.",

He took the West Indies second-string bowlers apart. So imperious were his back-foot shots through the covers, he might as well have been playing against a prep school eleven.

Some of those shots through the off side could be queried by the purist: his bat is not always quite straight and he cuffs the ball like a politically incorrect master might an impertinent pupil. </p> <p>Yet the purist would be a fool to carp. Stewart's fluency can, as it did here at Manchester, transform a Test match. Until he came to the crease, batting had been an unremitting struggle. Only the exciting wristiness of young Ramnaresh Sarwan had offered glimpses of batting as a pleasure. And England were on the brink of embarking upon a desperate grind at 17 for 3. </p> <p>Had Stewart nicked one of Walsh's leg-cutters early on, it is difficult to imagine that the score would have advanced much beyond 100 by close of play.

Along with Vaughan, he is the second new, young England batsman to look not only the part, but also freshly and pinkly curatical (both of them giving the lie to one of Len Hutton's more enigmatic oracular pronouncements, that 'pink-faced batsmen can't bat'). </p> <p>Phlegmatic and slightly ponderous between the wickets, he keeps his head impeccably still whether in attack or defence. His footwork is simple and decisive. His technique is uncomplicated, and his timing here, as in the one- day internationals, excellent. He had to get through a testing first hour, batting against the two great old-timers, not getting off the mark until the first ball bowled by Ambrose's replacement, Rose, in the eleventh over. </p> <p>This ordeal reminded me of Justin Langer's torrid first hour at the crease in Test cricket. It was at Adelaide in 1992, also against Ambrose and Walsh; at the end of it the Australian was 0 not out, had been struck on the helmet three times, and could see no likelihood of ever scoring a Test run. </p> <p>When at last Trescothick thick-edged Walsh through the slips for the first runs scored off this master of skim and cut after 65 minutes, he received an uncharitable, even unchristian look. But while there can never have been a meaner pair of opening bowlers, the rest of this West Indies attack, more than any I can remember, let the opposition off the hook. And this fish got away. </p> <p>Trescothick clearly is enjoying himself immensely. The same can be said of the English team as a whole. They radiate confidence and aggression in the field. I was delighted to see how close in the slips stood at the beginning of the match, rewarded by Thorpe's sharp catch to dismiss Campbell. The same zest has been evident in the running between the wickets, notably by Cork and Croft. </p> <p>Above all, England have a proper Test attack, with no let-up for the batsman. Cork has done what we hoped he would when he burst in on the Test scene five years ago. The next challenge for him will be to discipline himself, to keep things tight when the ball doesn't swing. At Lord's, and here, it has, just nicely, and Cork has been admirable. When he gets the ball to deviate even a little he is especially difficult for tailenders, giving them no room to swing the bat and threatening lbws every ball. And White has been immensely impressive as fourth seamer. He looks what he is - Australian fused with Yorkshire grit. He is genuinely quick, has orthodox and reverse swing, and is capable of getting out the best batsmen on flat pitches. </p> <p>Credit must go to captain and coach, as well as stand-in captain Stewart, for this improvement. Selection too has been on the basis of serious assessment rather than ephemeral form. Despite his bizarre and skilful dismissal, I applaud Thorpe's selection. Trescothick, Vaughan, Cork and White have all been inspired choices.

Nevertheless, the behaviour of magicicada septendecim is startling for one particular feature: each member of each grub community knows exactly when to pop out of the ground so they all appear in unison.

Yet they are linked, as is revealed at the London Natural History Museum's new exhibition, Rhythms of Life, for it turns out that human beings, like other forms of life, have their own behaviour-regulating internal clocks. These biological timepieces may not produce such abrupt and sensational leaps in character as that displayed by the cicada. Nevertheless, they are important, for when their activity is disrupted, we suffer. </p> <p>'Every animal or plant has some biochemical control system that acts as an internal biological clock,' said exhibition co-ordinator Paul Bowers. 'In the case of the cicada, it produces no discernible behavioural changes for 17 years, and then suddenly everything changes at once. However, in other creatures - including humans - their influence on behaviour is constant and pervasive.' </p> <p>In fact, humans have many different biological clocks, the four most important being those that regulate our immune system, digestion, appetite and sleep. 'If you fly to Hong Kong, which is eight hours in front of us, all four of these clocks are disrupted, and each tries to reset itself,' says Bowers. 'Some clocks try to go forward eight hours, others try to go back 16 hours. The end result is biological mayhem, which we experience as jet lag.' </p> <p>Not that we are unique in suffering such misery. Most mammals seem to experience some form of jet leg. You can induce it in the laboratory - in hamsters, for instance. All you have to do is fiddle around with the lighting of their cages. Switch to Hawaiian time and the creatures' clocks go haywire so that they run on their damnable, squeaky little wheels in daylight and not when you are trying to sleep. </p> <p>But if we understand the causes of jet lag, does that help us prevent it, or at least minimise its effects? In short, what can we do to fight its effects? The answer, says Bower, is quite a lot. </p> <p>First, you should try to adapt to the time zone you are travelling to as soon as possible. Don't wait until you get on your plane. Start to make adjustments - meals or naps - before you leave home for the airport. 'Then when you get on to the plane, lay off the alcohol,' says Bowers. 'It's a depressant and it will simply make you feel lousy.' </p> <p>However, you can take drugs, he says - in particular, coffee, which will keep you awake when your body tries to persuade you to nod off at inappropriate times. </p> <p>'Humans have two programmed sleep signals: the main one is switched on at night; the second, lighter one comes on in the early afternoon. We are actually programmed to take naps, in other words. And that can be dangerous when you first arrive in a new time zone. It can make you drowsy just when you have to stay awake.' So take lots of coffee, particularly during the first two days of your trip. Melatonin is also acceptable, adds Bowers, but again travellers should take care. It should be taken only on the evening before you leave. Take it at the wrong time and you will accentuate your jet lag. </p> <p>'There is also a great deal of variation among people when it comes to biological clocks. Some people naturally swing to a day that is slightly more than 24 hours long, some to one that is less than 24 hours. The former are owls; they tend to stay up late at night. The latter are larks; they get up early in the morning. </p> <p>'Similarly, there is great variation in individuals' ability to cope with long-distance travel. So if someone swears by an answer to jet lag, remember, it may not work for you. You have to work on developing your own personalised cure from these basic ingredients.' </p> <p>\u0095 The Rhythms of Life exhibition can be seen at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington, London, until 7 May.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the 11-year-old New Zealand actress Anna Paquin accepted her Oscar from Gene Hackman and turned to at the audience, dumbstruck and terrified, it was tempting to think she had a dreadful life in store. It was 1994. Surely, her life would now spiral out of control. Chaos beckoned. Paquin, the second-youngest Academy Award winner in history, would be mobbed, first by reporters, and then by agents, directors and drug dealers. There would be cigarettes and booze, ill-advised relationships, rehab. Perhaps she would be like Drew Barrymore and fight her way back. On the other hand, perhaps she'd be like Tatum O'Neal, the youngest-ever Oscar winner, and quietly fizzle out. Where is Tatum now? </p> <p>But Paquin has, apparently, not spiralled or fizzled. Here she is, in the Essex House Hotel on Central Park South, Manhattan, picking her way through a plateful of chicken and salad. The angry little girl from The Piano! And she's 18! She eats slowly, but not neurotically slowly. She is 5ft 5in tall now, and wears a tight, black formal dress. She is better looking than you thought she'd get. She has a good modern-actress look - her face snaps easily into a sort of darkly sulky expression. There is something of Juliette Lewis about her. She has grown up to be sexy, but not bland-sexy. Paquin's oddball-sexy. </p> <p>She's not bothered about being 18, she says, shrugging. She shrugs a lot. 'At 18,' she tells me, 'you can get married, you can smoke, and you can join the army. But I don't want to join the army.' Does she smoke? Does she drink? She shakes her head so that her hair swings in front of her face. This, along with the shrugging and a sort of lip-chewing, is another of her gestures. You see it in her adolescent-period films, A Walk on the Moon and She's All That. Actually, that's how she still looks, 15 or 16, a touch younger than her age. She gives the impression of being a bit intense and unusual. Having chopped most of her hair off a couple of years ago, she's grown it long again. </p> <p>Paquin is here to talk about her part in X-Men, her first role in a major blockbuster. Based on the comic books, X-Men has been directed by Bryan Singer, who did The Usual Suspects. Paquin plays Rogue, a dark, sultry girl who is not quite innocent - her usual role, in fact, and one she does well, because it's her. She has been known to say that she doesn't think much about acting - she just does it. X-Men , which cost $75m to make, has just opened in America, to mixed reviews and terrific box office, making $54.5m in its first weekend, and taking over from Men in Black as Hollywood's biggest-ever July opening. It's also the biggest-opening non-sequel ever. </p> <p>The world of the X-Men is divided between humans, who are normal, and Mutants, who have special powers, but also disabilities. The Mutants, including a wheel chair-bound Patrick Stewart, and Sir Ian McKellen, represent minorities in general - they are blacks or people with disabilities. It's a clever idea. When Paquin's character touches or kisses anybody, she practically kills them; you see the life force visibly draining out. She says she read 'hundreds' of comic books to prepare for the part of Rogue. 'She's the ultimate adolescent,' says Paquin, who is sharp with literary metaphors. 'Frightened of being really close to others. Not knowing who you can trust.' Adolescence? 'It's hard to be detached from something you're still slightly living in,' says Paquin. 'You're in the process of becoming an adult, and you're changing - like, every few weeks you feel like a different person, and your looks are changing, and the way you see the world, and the way you see your family. Just because I do what I do doesn't mean I escaped adolescence, all the bumps and bruises that go along with it.' </p> <p>So, as you can see by now, Paquin has not travelled the self-destructive route, nor has her career fizzled out. For seven years, she has attempted to do the impossible, to grow up normally and be a film star at the same time, and, if she hasn't quite succeeded, she's come pretty close. Eating her chicken and salad, poking it around a bit, but not neurotically, she talks about normal things: answering-machine messages, coffee, hanging out, and the importance of sleeping in. She likes sleeping in and sitting in coffee bars; she used to like novelty phone messages, and now dislikes them. She absolutely does not have any exercise or dietary regime. </p> <p>Every so often, she will talk about something which is not so normal, such as being recognised by members of the public. 'Maybe you're in a public restroom or something,' she says, 'and you have, like, just woken up, or you're, like, at the supermarket or something, and you're just feeling, Oh my God - is this going to be their impression of me?' </p> <p>Like Jodie Foster, Claire Danes and Natalie Portman, and unlike Drew Barrymore, Tatum O'Neal, Judy Garland and Shirley Temple, Paquin is going to college - this autumn, to Columbia in New York, where she will study arts and social-science subjects, possibly majoring in psychology. She is academic, despite having suffered a mixed, topsy-turvy education in an all-girls' school in Wellington, New Zealand; on the set of several movies, which she found a trial, and, for two years, in a Los Angeles high school. 'I have done pretty well in math,' she says, 'and I've always been pretty good at science, but English and languages and history have always been very easy for me.' She wants to go to college partly to gain experience of normal life - life outside acting. She pauses and says, 'For all the other thousands and thousands of kids that are going off to college this year, no one makes a big deal about it, and I'd rather be like everyone else.' </p> <p>Paquin stopped being like everyone else at the age of nine, when she turned up, along with thousands of other girls, to audition for the part of Flora, Holly Hunter's screen daughter in Jane Campion's film The Piano. She does not, she tells me, remember much about her life before The Piano, 'just random things'. Her mother, Mary, is an English teacher from Wellington; her father, Brian, is a physical-education instructor from Canada. Paquin was born in Winnipeg. She has a sister, Katya, and a brother, Andrew, two and five years older respectively, both academic achievers; Andrew has since studied at Harvard and Katya debated for New Zealand at the World School Debating championships. Little Anna was, she tells me, 'the one that no one particularly noticed. She wanted to tag along, but couldn't.' </p> <p>At nine, she hadn't acted before, unless you count her part as a skunk in a play at her primary school in Lower Hutt, a suburb of Wellington. 'I leaped on stage, and then skipped off,' she says. Her audition for Campion, a couple of years later, was startling. Campion describes her as 'this tiny little girl, probably the smallest of all I'd seen, and extremely shy'. In the audition, Paquin delivered the speech about how her mother had lost her voice, the emotional speech of a disturbed child. She was, says Campion, 'impassioned. You totally believed her.' What she had, said co-star Holly Hunter, was 'glorious instincts'. </p> <p>Paquin tells me that, during the filming of The Piano, she 'wasn't really conscious of what she was doing'. She had a voice coach, who taught her an Aberdeen accent, which she pulled off pretty well. She scowled and raged beautifully. There seemed to be a dark monster inside this little creature. Her subsequent characters, as critics have pointed out, all seem to be a version of this one. What Paquin discovered at the age of nine is that she liked pretending to be somebody else in this intense way. She threw herself into it. It was not quite a job. She had no difficulty whatsoever. 'I was,' she says, 'so young when I made The Piano that I really didn't know that I should be nervous.' </p> <p>The nerves came later, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, when Paquin stepped up to accept her Oscar from Gene Hackman. This was when she first had an inkling of the hugeness of what she'd done. It was, she tells me, 'really scary. I remember being very very worried I wasn't going to be able to say anything.' She stood, in the words of one observer, 'wide-eyed and gulping for breath at the microphone for a full 20-some odd seconds'. Then she made a little speech and rushed back to her seat, rather than taking the more usual winners' route backstage. Hackman tried to call her back. Later, she told reporters that winning the Oscar was 'pretty cool', and reportedly fell asleep several times at the party afterwards. </p> <p>And then she went back to New Zealand and attempted to get back to normality. After the Academy Awards ceremony, she went on a school camping trip. She didn't appear in a film for two years, although she flew to Hollywood a few times for auditions. At 14, she told a reporter she thought the Hollywood scene was 'kinda weird'. She did not display the Oscar. She kept it in a drawer. She was slightly haunted by it. In 1996, she played the lead in Zeffirelli's Jane Eyre , which was filmed in England; the director thought she was perfect for his dour, slightly cantankerous Jane. Paquin was sombre and reined-in; you could tell she was going to be good. </p> <p>It was while she was in Canada filming Fly Away Home, a film about a teenage girl and her relationship with a flock of geese, that her parents split up. This, she tells me, was the unhappiest moment of her life. During filming, she appeared on set with a fake nose-ring - she'd found it in a 'neat junky jewellery store' in Toronto, and thought she'd shock the cast. But the director, Carroll Ballard, liked the nose-ring. Anna's character, Amy, wears it in the film. </p> <p>When she was 15, Paquin moved to Hollywood with her mother, at first temporarily, to pursue her career. She told a magazine: 'It isn't likely that I'll have a boyfriend in the near future. Boys make quite good friends - it's difficult to imagine doing something serious with them, such as dating.' This was just before she played Alison in A Walk on the Moon, a girl having her first period in 1969 - during Woodstock, no less. Entering puberty, she played girls entering puberty; her most intimate teenage moments have been acted out in public. If you want to know how she felt about her parents splitting up, watch her as Alison, whose parents' marriage is also on the rocks. You can see a stormy mixture of rage and grief in Alison's face. When she talks to her father, played by Liev Schreiber, about the possibility that he might leave her mother (Diane Lane), it's moving; it feels genuine. In the film, the parents get back together; in real life, they did not. </p> <p>By the time she was 16, things had changed. A Los Angeles high-school student, she had a boyfriend, and said, 'Sixteen is such a good age. It's so much older than 15. It's, like, 50 years older than 15. Fifteen is a nothing age. There's nothing you can do when you're 15 that you can't do when you're 14.' The Oscar remained hidden. 'I keep it at the back of my closet, with my shoes,' she said. 'I don't want to look at it every day. I don't want people to come into my room and think they have to talk about it.' </p> <p>It hasn't always been easy at school. She left friends behind in New Zealand, and made new friends at high school in Los Angeles. But she misses the old ones. Her accent is now more than half American, with the Kiwi creeping through. She'll end up sounding almost American, like Mel Gibson. She says, 'You're definitely shaped by the culture you've been brought up in, and even though I couldn't tell you exactly what it means to be a New Zealander, I think I've been influenced a lot by that culture.' </p> <p>She lolls her head and thinks for a moment. She says, 'I don't know. I mean, I love the people I've gone to school with, but sometimes I'll just really want to talk to someone back at home. And I don't know exactly what triggers that off. I'll just suddenly be, like... there's something a little bit different. I don't know.' </p> <p>Paquin understands the importance of being 'good friends with people who I absolutely know are being my friends because they like Anna, and they get along with Anna, and they want to be my friend, and we connect as people. That has nothing to do with the fact that I have a career. I've met people that I know don't like me, they're just a little bit impressed with what I do, and I guess that's understandable. Usually they get bored because I'm really not that interesting. But, you see, I kind of like that. Maybe they think I'm something special now, but give it a week and I promise you they'll be toddling off back to where they came from. I'm very ordinary. I don't feel like I do anything. </p> <p>'I haven't entirely figured myself out,' she continues. 'I've got a long way to go before I figure out something as deep as that.' She likes the MTV cartoon Daria, about a teenage girl with a dark, cynical take on the world. Her favourite actress is Holly Hunter. Her favourite TV show is Sex and the City. I ask her if she thinks the female characters in Sex and the City are supposed to be victims. </p> <p>'I've no idea.' </p> <p>Doh! Of course she has no idea - she's a teenager. When you talk to her about her ambitions for the future, about what she might be doing later in life, she wonders what you mean by the future. For Paquin, the future is next week, or next term. I ask her what she'd like to be doing at 40 - the age when many really good actresses begin to think they might win an Oscar. Paquin says, 'Forty?' It's a concept at the edge of her understanding. It's light years away. 'I don't know,' she says. 'I probably hope that I have a family, and if I still want to be acting that I'm acting, and if I want to do something else that I'm doing that.' </p> <p>One thing she likes to talk about is photography. 'Something I like to do,' she tells me, 'is sit somewhere on a crowded street when no one can really see, out of the way, and then take photographs of people just candidly as they're walking past when they don't know you're there, and it sounds kinda like you're a stalker, but honestly I'm not. Sometimes it's more interesting to photograph somebody when they're just being themselves, because they're not projecting an image of how they want to be seen. You get to see who they really are.' </p> <p>Paquin likes photographing couples. 'It's interesting photographing them and then playing \"guess what was going on right then\". Deciding what the dynamic was, whether they are happy, what they are truly feeling. It's a little bit of a game, and it's all just sort of fictional, but it was fun to decide what was going through that person's head, you know, if you see someone before they've pasted on a smile. Sometimes you can see something in people which you wouldn't otherwise get to see. </p> <p>'I don't think there's any character I couldn't be,' says Paquin. It seemed highly unlikely, but it looks as if she's just about made the transition from child star to adult actress. Who knows - she might have quite some career ahead of her. In the meantime, she says, she wants to do 'not a whole lot. It's summer. I've just left high school.' She wants to mess around like a normal teenager. Like, she tells me, she recently took some self-portraits, using a bendable mirror. She loved the results. 'You get this crazy-looking distorted image,' she says. She laughs. 'Four eyes and two heads. Like, an alien-shaped body.'</p> <p>\u0095 X-Men is released on 18 August</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the 11-year-old New Zealand actress Anna Paquin accepted her Oscar from Gene Hackman and turned to at the audience, dumbstruck and terrified, it was tempting to think she had a dreadful life in store. It was 1994. Surely, her life would now spiral out of control. Chaos beckoned. Paquin, the second-youngest Academy Award winner in history, would be mobbed, first by reporters, and then by agents, directors and drug dealers. There would be cigarettes and booze, ill-advised relationships, rehab. Perhaps she would be like Drew Barrymore and fight her way back. On the other hand, perhaps she'd be like Tatum O'Neal, the youngest-ever Oscar winner, and quietly fizzle out. Where is Tatum now? But Paquin has, apparently, not spiralled or fizzled. Here she is, in the Essex House Hotel on Central Park South, Manhattan, picking her way through a plateful of chicken and salad. The angry little girl from The Piano! And she's 18! She eats slowly, but not neurotically slowly. She is 5ft 5in tall now, and wears a tight, black formal dress. She is better looking than you thought she'd get. She has a good modern-actress look - her face snaps easily into a sort of darkly sulky expression. There is something of Juliette Lewis about her. She has grown up to be sexy, but not bland-sexy. Paquin's oddball-sexy. She's not bothered about being 18, she says, shrugging. She shrugs a lot. 'At 18,' she tells me, 'you can get married, you can smoke, and you can join the army. But I don't want to join the army.' Does she smoke? Does she drink? She shakes her head so that her hair swings in front of her face. This, along with the shrugging and a sort of lip-chewing, is another of her gestures. You see it in her adolescent-period films, A Walk on the Moon and She's All That. Actually, that's how she still looks, 15 or 16, a touch younger than her age. She gives the impression of being a bit intense and unusual. Having chopped most of her hair off a couple of years ago, she's grown it long again. Paquin is here to talk about her part in X-Men, her first role in a major blockbuster. Based on the comic books, X-Men has been directed by Bryan Singer, who did The Usual Suspects. Paquin plays Rogue, a dark, sultry girl who is not quite innocent - her usual role, in fact, and one she does well, because it's her. She has been known to say that she doesn't think much about acting - she just does it. X-Men , which cost $75m to make, has just opened in America, to mixed reviews and terrific box office, making $54.5m in its first weekend, and taking over from Men in Black as Hollywood's biggest-ever July opening. It's also the biggest-opening non-sequel ever. The world of the X-Men is divided between humans, who are normal, and Mutants, who have special powers, but also disabilities. The Mutants, including a wheel chair-bound Patrick Stewart, and Sir Ian McKellen, represent minorities in general - they are blacks or people with disabilities. It's a clever idea. When Paquin's character touches or kisses anybody, she practically kills them; you see the life force visibly draining out. She says she read 'hundreds' of comic books to prepare for the part of Rogue. 'She's the ultimate adolescent,' says Paquin, who is sharp with literary metaphors. 'Frightened of being really close to others. Not knowing who you can trust.' Adolescence? 'It's hard to be detached from something you're still slightly living in,' says Paquin. 'You're in the process of becoming an adult, and you're changing - like, every few weeks you feel like a different person, and your looks are changing, and the way you see the world, and the way you see your family. Just because I do what I do doesn't mean I escaped adolescence, all the bumps and bruises that go along with it.' So, as you can see by now, Paquin has not travelled the self-destructive route, nor has her career fizzled out. For seven years, she has attempted to do the impossible, to grow up normally and be a film star at the same time, and, if she hasn't quite succeeded, she's come pretty close. Eating her chicken and salad, poking it around a bit, but not neurotically, she talks about normal things: answering-machine messages, coffee, hanging out, and the importance of sleeping in. She likes sleeping in and sitting in coffee bars; she used to like novelty phone messages, and now dislikes them. She absolutely does not have any exercise or dietary regime. Every so often, she will talk about something which is not so normal, such as being recognised by members of the public. 'Maybe you're in a public restroom or something,' she says, 'and you have, like, just woken up, or you're, like, at the supermarket or something, and you're just feeling, Oh my God - is this going to be their impression of me?' Like Jodie Foster, Claire Danes and Natalie Portman, and unlike Drew Barrymore, Tatum O'Neal, Judy Garland and Shirley Temple, Paquin is going to college - this autumn, to Columbia in New York, where she will study arts and social-science subjects, possibly majoring in psychology. She is academic, despite having suffered a mixed, topsy-turvy education in an all-girls' school in Wellington, New Zealand; on the set of several movies, which she found a trial, and, for two years, in a Los Angeles high school. 'I have done pretty well in math,' she says, 'and I've always been pretty good at science, but English and languages and history have always been very easy for me.' She wants to go to college partly to gain experience of normal life - life outside acting. She pauses and says, 'For all the other thousands and thousands of kids that are going off to college this year, no one makes a big deal about it, and I'd rather be like everyone else.' Paquin stopped being like everyone else at the age of nine, when she turned up, along with thousands of other girls, to audition for the part of Flora, Holly Hunter's screen daughter in Jane Campion's film The Piano. She does not, she tells me, remember much about her life before The Piano, 'just random things'. Her mother, Mary, is an English teacher from Wellington; her father, Brian, is a physical-education instructor from Canada. Paquin was born in Winnipeg. She has a sister, Katya, and a brother, Andrew, two and five years older respectively, both academic achievers; Andrew has since studied at Harvard and Katya debated for New Zealand at the World School Debating championships. Little Anna was, she tells me, 'the one that no one particularly noticed. She wanted to tag along, but couldn't.' At nine, she hadn't acted before, unless you count her part as a skunk in a play at her primary school in Lower Hutt, a suburb of Wellington. 'I leaped on stage, and then skipped off,' she says. Her audition for Campion, a couple of years later, was startling. Campion describes her as 'this tiny little girl, probably the smallest of all I'd seen, and extremely shy'. In the audition, Paquin delivered the speech about how her mother had lost her voice, the emotional speech of a disturbed child. She was, says Campion, 'impassioned. You totally believed her.' What she had, said co-star Holly Hunter, was 'glorious instincts'. Paquin tells me that, during the filming of The Piano, she 'wasn't really conscious of what she was doing'. She had a voice coach, who taught her an Aberdeen accent, which she pulled off pretty well. She scowled and raged beautifully. There seemed to be a dark monster inside this little creature. Her subsequent characters, as critics have pointed out, all seem to be a version of this one. What Paquin discovered at the age of nine is that she liked pretending to be somebody else in this intense way. She threw herself into it. It was not quite a job. She had no difficulty whatsoever. 'I was,' she says, 'so young when I made The Piano that I really didn't know that I should be nervous.' The nerves came later, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, when Paquin stepped up to accept her Oscar from Gene Hackman. This was when she first had an inkling of the hugeness of what she'd done. It was, she tells me, 'really scary. I remember being very very worried I wasn't going to be able to say anything.' She stood, in the words of one observer, 'wide-eyed and gulping for breath at the microphone for a full 20-some odd seconds'. Then she made a little speech and rushed back to her seat, rather than taking the more usual winners' route backstage. Hackman tried to call her back. Later, she told reporters that winning the Oscar was 'pretty cool', and reportedly fell asleep several times at the party afterwards. And then she went back to New Zealand and attempted to get back to normality. After the Academy Awards ceremony, she went on a school camping trip. She didn't appear in a film for two years, although she flew to Hollywood a few times for auditions. At 14, she told a reporter she thought the Hollywood scene was 'kinda weird'. She did not display the Oscar. She kept it in a drawer. She was slightly haunted by it. In 1996, she played the lead in Zeffirelli's Jane Eyre , which was filmed in England; the director thought she was perfect for his dour, slightly cantankerous Jane. Paquin was sombre and reined-in; you could tell she was going to be good. It was while she was in Canada filming Fly Away Home, a film about a teenage girl and her relationship with a flock of geese, that her parents split up. This, she tells me, was the unhappiest moment of her life. During filming, she appeared on set with a fake nose-ring - she'd found it in a 'neat junky jewellery store' in Toronto, and thought she'd shock the cast. But the director, Carroll Ballard, liked the nose-ring. Anna's character, Amy, wears it in the film. When she was 15, Paquin moved to Hollywood with her mother, at first temporarily, to pursue her career. She told a magazine: 'It isn't likely that I'll have a boyfriend in the near future. Boys make quite good friends - it's difficult to imagine doing something serious with them, such as dating.' This was just before she played Alison in A Walk on the Moon, a girl having her first period in 1969 - during Woodstock, no less. Entering puberty, she played girls entering puberty; her most intimate teenage moments have been acted out in public. If you want to know how she felt about her parents splitting up, watch her as Alison, whose parents' marriage is also on the rocks. You can see a stormy mixture of rage and grief in Alison's face. When she talks to her father, played by Liev Schreiber, about the possibility that he might leave her mother (Diane Lane), it's moving; it feels genuine.

There's nothing you can do when you're 15 that you can't do when you're 14.' The Oscar remained hidden. 'I keep it at the back of my closet, with my shoes,' she said. 'I don't want to look at it every day. I don't want people to come into my room and think they have to talk about it.' It hasn't always been easy at school. She left friends behind in New Zealand, and made new friends at high school in Los Angeles. But she misses the old ones. Her accent is now more than half American, with the Kiwi creeping through. She'll end up sounding almost American, like Mel Gibson.

Paquin understands the importance of being 'good friends with people who I absolutely know are being my friends because they like Anna, and they get along with Anna, and they want to be my friend, and we connect as people.

But the eight-year-old Mohammed's widowed father doesn't arrive and he sits alone in the school garden, a small, infinitely sad presence, his wary open face expressing both his loneliness and his heightened sensitivity to sound, smell and touch. </p> <p>A cat stirs among the bushes and we hope it will come to comfort Mohammed. Instead, the boy scares the cat away, throwing stones at it, an act we interpret as an expression of anger and frustration. But we are wrong. He's heard the faint sound of a fledgling among the fallen leaves and after finding the little bird he puts it in his shirt pocket and with immense difficulty he climbs a tree, locates the nest and puts the bird back where it belongs. </p> <p>This wordless sequence is beautiful and affecting. It is also, we later discover, a central metaphor, because Mohammed's father, Hashem (Hosein Mahjoob), wants to leave the boy at the school and only with the greatest reluctance takes him home to be with his beloved sisters and elderly grandmother. </p> <p>Hashem is a struggling smallholder with a job in a little charcoal factory in a beautiful, verdant part of rural Iran quite near the sea and unlike the dusty, desert setting of most Iranian pictures. He is planning to remarry a younger woman and regards Mohammed as a major encumbrance, yet another curse placed on him by a cruel deity. </p> <p>When Hashem leaves his son as a live-in apprentice with a blind carpenter, the grief-stricken Mohammed, a true believer, thinks that he has been rejected by the omnipresent, invisible God, a being as accessible to the blind as to the sighted. Eventually, in an melodramatic finale worthy of D.W. Griffith in his prime, the film is resolved on an ambiguous note of tragic hope. </p> <p>The film could not work without the surface simplicity of Majidi's unaffected direction and the magnificent performance by the blind Mohsen Ramezani, with whom the director has clearly established a strong rapport. There is something beatific about the boy, but there's no trace of sentimentality or sanctimoniousness in the way he's presented. We enter his world, experiencing his joys and pains, his delight in nature, his love for his grandmother, his wish to be treated like a normal member of the community. </p> <p>There are scenes in this picture that etch themselves into the spectator's brain. In the bus going home, Mohammed holds his hand outside the window: 'I want to catch he wind.' he says. He takes his grandma's hand, telling her that the skin she thinks calloused by hard work is beautiful - 'Your hands are white.' He touches his little sister's face, telling her she's growing up. </p> <p>Visiting the village school he astonishes the pupils by reading with absolute fluency the Braille text of the same primer they've been stumbling over and they gather round him in wonder. He listens to the woodpeckers and tries to work out their tapping as a form of code, analogous to Braille. </p> <p>With this film coming so soon after the Cannes screening of the the 20-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards, there can be no doubting that another formidable generation of Iranian filmmakers is emerging, and that they have a peculiar sensitivity to the young and vulnerable. </p>",

When Hashem leaves his son as a live-in apprentice with a blind carpenter, the grief-stricken Mohammed, a true believer, thinks that he has been rejected by the omnipresent, invisible God, a being as accessible to the blind as to the sighted. Eventually, in an melodramatic finale worthy of D.W. Griffith in his prime, the film is resolved on an ambiguous note of tragic hope. The film could not work without the surface simplicity of Majidi's unaffected direction and the magnificent performance by the blind Mohsen Ramezani, with whom the director has clearly established a strong rapport. There is something beatific about the boy, but there's no trace of sentimentality or sanctimoniousness in the way he's presented. We enter his world, experiencing his joys and pains, his delight in nature, his love for his grandmother, his wish to be treated like a normal member of the community. There are scenes in this picture that etch themselves into the spectator's brain. In the bus going home, Mohammed holds his hand outside the window: 'I want to catch he wind.' he says. He takes his grandma's hand, telling her that the skin she thinks calloused by hard work is beautiful - 'Your hands are white.' He touches his little sister's face, telling her she's growing up. Visiting the village school he astonishes the pupils by reading with absolute fluency the Braille text of the same primer they've been stumbling over and they gather round him in wonder. He listens to the woodpeckers and tries to work out their tapping as a form of code, analogous to Braille. With this film coming so soon after the Cannes screening of the the 20-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards, there can be no doubting that another formidable generation of Iranian filmmakers is emerging, and that they have a peculiar sensitivity to the young and vulnerable.",

This is our third call on a Milk Wood trail designed to back up claims in the controversial book.

'There are lots of references in the text that I have tied to New Quay,' Thomas explains. </p> <p>As we sit talking, a sudden squall whirls into the bay, interrupting our view as the scene is drained of all colour and the rows of cottages dissolve until they are no more than blurred geological strata in a monochrome landscape. In the course of this one March day we shall see three rainbows, shelter snugly in Dylan-approved pubs from two hailstone showers, and sun ourselves unseasonably on the sandy beach. </p> <p>Jean and Joe are surprised to learn of their home's involvement in the Thomas story. They did not know the poet stole daffodil bulbs from the garage, thinking them to be onions. </p> <p>Fynnon Feddyg (the name means Doctor's Well) was the home of William Killick, a wartime drinking companion of the poet, who played a central role in a dramatic News of the Worldly incident. Killick, a Commando captain who landed in Greece to fight with the partisans, was married to Vera, a friend of the poet since their childhood days in Swansea. In 1944 Dylan and Caitlin Thomas were the couple's nearest neighbours, 100 yards up the lane at Majoda, which was then an asbestos shack whose name was derived from those of its owner's children, Marjorie, John and David. </p> <p>The following year, Killick returned home on leave to be told by the bank manager that his wife had run up an overdraft, caused, the Commando seems to have concluded, by her generosity to a freeloading draft-dodger and his Bohemian wife. After a scuffle with the poet and some cronies in the Black Lion pub one March night, the serviceman returned to Ffynnon Feddyg in a drunken rage, collected his machine gun and a hand grenade and proceeded to shoot up Majoda with the Thomases inside. </p> <p>At Lampeter Assizes that June, the war hero was cleared of attempted murder and returned to operational duties. The tale made it into the Sunday scandal sheets and the poet soon ended his sojourn in New Quay. </p> <p>He had first become acquainted with the area while staying at Plas Llanina, and it was here our walk began. The seventeenth century mansion was rented by Lord Howard de Walden, a rich patron of the arts. </p> <p>James Maurice, Llanina's present owner, showed us the ruined Apple House, where Thomas wrote. Lanina legends of victims lost in the treacherous waters of Cardigan Bay inspired Captain Cat's confrontation with the long dead seamen at the opening of Under Milk Wood . De Walden had been introduced to the brilliant young poet by painter Augustus John, Caitlin's former lover. The peer stumped up \u00a350 and offered the use of this crumbling building. </p> <p>A couple of hundred yards down the lane at Majoda, Eunice Chetcuti assured us that the bullet holes had long since been repaired, and little remains of the original structure. 'You can see why it was so inspiring for Dylan,' she says, gesturing to the sweep of the bay as we leave. </p> <p>From Majoda we trace the poet's daily trek into the hospitable village and its wide array of watering holes.

One thing you might like to know is the origin of such phrases as 'sitting on the fence', 'toeing the line', and 'throwing down the gauntlet'; ask your guide. The 75-minute tour may be tedious for younger children but I enjoyed it, and recommend it to adults, older children and anyone with even a passing interest in history. \u0095 Tours run from 7 August until 16 September, Mondays to Saturdays, from 9.30am until 4.15pm. Tickets must be booked at least five days ahead from Ticketmaster (020 7344 9966).",

      "body": "<p> 'What do you mean, they're remaking The Breakfast Club?' The information came a couple of weeks back from a Hollywood contact. I was a little shocked. The thought of revisiting John Hughes' artless Eighties teen film might offer an intriguing prospect in this age of countless, all too knowing high school movies. But my generation of moviegoers is apt to be very protective of The Breakfast Club and its brother in angst St Elmo's Fire - they were the movies you had to see again and again.</p> <p> I was 15 years old when the two films were released in 1985, and they seemed to define the contemporary teen spirit. The stars of the two films spawned the Leonardo DiCaprios and Katie Holmes of their day, and came complete with the year's spin-off pop hits. (Simple Minds' 'Don't You Forget About Me' was The Breakfast Club theme tune.) However, on reflection, and certainly on reviewing, perhaps any affection is misplaced.</p> <p> It was hardly a golden age to be a teen viewer. If you were lucky enough to be 15 in the mid to late Sixties, you got to have Bonny And Clyde or Easy Rider as your formative movie experiences. A decade later and it was the likes of Taxi Driver, Jaws and The Godfather that turned a generation on to film. And us? Well, we were the fortunate ones who had Tom Cruise prancing about in his underpants in Risky Business, and, of course, the glorious Brat Pack. </p> <p>A few definitions first. The 'official' Brat Pack consists of the following nine actors, the combined casts of St Elmo's Fire and The Breakfast Club. They are: Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Mare Winnigham, Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson. Purists may argue that, in fact, it is the cast of St Elmo's alone that comprises the pack. Incidentally, the term was coined by a New York Magazine journalist after he spent an apparently unedifying evening in the company of Emilio Estevez during the shooting of Joel Schumacher's opus. </p> <p>Over the years other actors have attempted to run with the pack. The casts of Francis Ford Coppola's arty angst-fests The Outsiders and Rumblefish (including Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise and the Karate Kid himself, Ralph Macchio) were often wrongly given Brat credentials - but those films were quite good. Probably because they were directed by Francis Ford Coppola and not Joel Schumacher. </p> <p> The casts of Young Guns I and II (including Kiefer Sutherland, Patrick Swayze and Lou Diamond Phillips) may have considered themselves de facto members simply because of the presence of Emilio Estevez in both movies. But if simply being in a movie with Emilio some time during the Eighties was enough we'd have to talk about Moon Unit Zappa (Nightmares, 1983), and obviously life's too short.

      "bodyText": "'What do you mean, they're remaking The Breakfast Club?' The information came a couple of weeks back from a Hollywood contact. I was a little shocked. The thought of revisiting John Hughes' artless Eighties teen film might offer an intriguing prospect in this age of countless, all too knowing high school movies. But my generation of moviegoers is apt to be very protective of The Breakfast Club and its brother in angst St Elmo's Fire - they were the movies you had to see again and again. I was 15 years old when the two films were released in 1985, and they seemed to define the contemporary teen spirit. The stars of the two films spawned the Leonardo DiCaprios and Katie Holmes of their day, and came complete with the year's spin-off pop hits. (Simple Minds' 'Don't You Forget About Me' was The Breakfast Club theme tune.) However, on reflection, and certainly on reviewing, perhaps any affection is misplaced. It was hardly a golden age to be a teen viewer. If you were lucky enough to be 15 in the mid to late Sixties, you got to have Bonny And Clyde or Easy Rider as your formative movie experiences. A decade later and it was the likes of Taxi Driver, Jaws and The Godfather that turned a generation on to film. And us? Well, we were the fortunate ones who had Tom Cruise prancing about in his underpants in Risky Business, and, of course, the glorious Brat Pack. A few definitions first. The 'official' Brat Pack consists of the following nine actors, the combined casts of St Elmo's Fire and The Breakfast Club. They are: Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Mare Winnigham, Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson. Purists may argue that, in fact, it is the cast of St Elmo's alone that comprises the pack. Incidentally, the term was coined by a New York Magazine journalist after he spent an apparently unedifying evening in the company of Emilio Estevez during the shooting of Joel Schumacher's opus. Over the years other actors have attempted to run with the pack. The casts of Francis Ford Coppola's arty angst-fests The Outsiders and Rumblefish (including Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise and the Karate Kid himself, Ralph Macchio) were often wrongly given Brat credentials - but those films were quite good. Probably because they were directed by Francis Ford Coppola and not Joel Schumacher. The casts of Young Guns I and II (including Kiefer Sutherland, Patrick Swayze and Lou Diamond Phillips) may have considered themselves de facto members simply because of the presence of Emilio Estevez in both movies. But if simply being in a movie with Emilio some time during the Eighties was enough we'd have to talk about Moon Unit Zappa (Nightmares, 1983), and obviously life's too short. No, it is St Elmo's and The Breakfast Club that provide the requisite credentials, mainly because of the similarities that yoked them and their youthful stars together. Both films, from any kind of objective viewpoint, are pretty bad - and in almost identical ways. The Breakfast Club is a film about a bunch of self-obsessed teens in detention who spend their time together pondering their various lives, blaming their parents for everything, undergoing a cathartic moment of self-recognition before concluding that basically they're all right. St Elmo's Fire is about a bunch of self-obsessed twentysomethings in a bar who spend their time together pondering their various lives, blaming society for everything, undergoing a cathartic moment of self-recognition before concluding that basically they're all right. In The Breakfast Club Emilio Estevez plays a jock with 'issues'. In St Elmo's Fire Rob Lowe plays a jock with 'issues'. The Breakfast Club has a horrible score by Simple Minds. St Elmo's Fire has a horrible score by John 'Man In Motion' Parr. The other major link was how cataclysmically the pack's careers crashed and burned immediately after 1985.

Most visitors use the road bridge. From Skye you can take speedboat excursions with Seafari Adventures (01852 300 003 and <a href=\"http://www.seafari.co.uk\">www.seafari.co.uk</a> to <strong> Rhum</strong> and <strong> Canna</strong> and spot rare white-tailed eagles, seals, dolphins and even the odd whale. Don't miss out on Inverie, Britain's most remote pub. </p> <p>Approach <strong> Ardnamurchan</strong> peninsula via the Corran ferry from Nether Locharber. The lighthouse and visitor centre (01972 510 210) are at the most westerly point of the British mainland: on a clear day you can see 23 islands. The natural history centre (01972 500 209) is also highly recommended. Children will find the Tobermory Chocolate Factory (01688 302 526, open 9.30am-5pm Monday to Saturday) on the nearby <strong> Isle of Mull</strong> irresistible. Whisky has been a mainstay of <strong> Islay</strong> for centuries and many distilleries are open to the public. Laphroaig Distillery is open Monday to Friday with free tours by appointment (call 01496 302 418). <strong> Arran</strong> joined the kingdom of Scotland in 1293, after the Battle of Largs, and there are numerous ancient ruins on the island. Fishing (for salmon and trout) and golf are well-established pastimes. <strong> Bute</strong> has been inhabited for 6,000 years and the family residence of the Marquess of Bute, Mount Stuart, is well worth a visit, though not quite so old. </p> <p> <strong> Jersey and Guernsey </strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong> High-speed ferry trips from Poole, Portsmouth and Weymouth take about two and half hours (Condor Ferries, 01305 761 551). To fly, try British Airways (0345 222 111) or British European (0990 676 676). </p> <p><strong> Things to do</strong> Since 1959 endangered animals have been reared at Jersey Zoo,which was set up by author Gerald Durrell. The gorillas and orang-utans are perennial favourites: call 01534 860 000 for details. Although cycling is the best way to explore Jersey (Zebra Cycle Hire 01534 736 556), admirers of sports cars won't be disappointed since you have to have at least a million pounds in the bank to move to the island. <strong> Sark</strong> and <strong> Alderney</strong> are easily reached from Guernsey, but may be too much of an odyssey for a day trip.

See Dublin Castle (00 353 167 77129, open daily, adults \u00a33, children \u00a31) or take an Irish City Tour (00 353 145 80054, adults \u00a314, children \u00a37). Wexford offers coastal villages and Blue Flag beaches at Curracloe and Kilmore Quay.

Head 10 miles south to Hillsborough to find Carrickfergus Castle (01960 351 273), Henry II's Irish stronghold, which was built in 1180 and was Ireland's first castle.(Northern Ireland Tourist Board - 0870 155 5250 and www.ni-tourism.com Western Isles and the Inner Hebrides Getting there Caledonian Macbrayne Ferries operates services throughout the islands. There are usually day trip deals. Call 08705 650 000 for reservations and inquiries, or visit www.calmac.co.uk Things to do The emphasis is on outdoor activities. Skye is the largest of the Hebrides and plentiful castles and forts on the coastline remind visitors of the island's past. Most visitors use the road bridge. From Skye you can take speedboat excursions with Seafari Adventures (01852 300 003 and www.seafari.co.uk to Rhum and Canna and spot rare white-tailed eagles, seals, dolphins and even the odd whale. Don't miss out on Inverie, Britain's most remote pub. Approach Ardnamurchan peninsula via the Corran ferry from Nether Locharber. The lighthouse and visitor centre (01972 510 210) are at the most westerly point of the British mainland: on a clear day you can see 23 islands. The natural history centre (01972 500 209) is also highly recommended. Children will find the Tobermory Chocolate Factory (01688 302 526, open 9.30am-5pm Monday to Saturday) on the nearby Isle of Mull irresistible. Whisky has been a mainstay of Islay for centuries and many distilleries are open to the public. Laphroaig Distillery is open Monday to Friday with free tours by appointment (call 01496 302 418). Arran joined the kingdom of Scotland in 1293, after the Battle of Largs, and there are numerous ancient ruins on the island. Fishing (for salmon and trout) and golf are well-established pastimes. Bute has been inhabited for 6,000 years and the family residence of the Marquess of Bute, Mount Stuart, is well worth a visit, though not quite so old. Jersey and Guernsey Getting there High-speed ferry trips from Poole, Portsmouth and Weymouth take about two and half hours (Condor Ferries, 01305 761 551). To fly, try British Airways (0345 222 111) or British European (0990 676 676). Things to do Since 1959 endangered animals have been reared at Jersey Zoo,which was set up by author Gerald Durrell. The gorillas and orang-utans are perennial favourites: call 01534 860 000 for details. Although cycling is the best way to explore Jersey (Zebra Cycle Hire 01534 736 556), admirers of sports cars won't be disappointed since you have to have at least a million pounds in the bank to move to the island. Sark and Alderney are easily reached from Guernsey, but may be too much of an odyssey for a day trip. The German Occupation Museum on Guernsey highlights a traumatic period in the Channel Islands' history.",

The German army, showing no sporting instinct, made its attack through Belgium. </p> <p>Something similar is happening now in economic policy in the US. The enemy is inflation, which threatens to end the long US fiesta of high growth. The Federal Reserve is raising its defences. Unfortunately the enemy is already within. </p> <p>This type of inflation is not consumer price inflation, which it is the Fed's remit to control. It is the intoxicating lubricant of the US's never-ending party, the source of the nation's joy, the grapes of its vine: the rise in US stock prices in the past few years. </p> <p>When the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, first warned of 'irrational exuberance' on 5 December 1996, the Dow Jones Index had risen by 26 per cent in the course of that year; the Nasdaq by 24 per cent. Greenspan's remark dulled the revellers' joie de vivre, but not for long. At its peak in January this year, the Dow had risen by a further 82 per cent since Greenspan's warning. The Nasdaq's rise was even more spectacular: at at its peak in March it had climbed by 288 per cent in little more than three years. </p> <p>So what, the reader might ask. Has the technology index not fallen since then? Is the Dow not hungover? Yes. But the bubbly of the past few years has done damage that the United States and the world economy will live with for some time. </p> <p>Since 1995 stock market euphoria has pervaded the US. The market has for the first time outgrown the economy: stock market capitalisation exceeded GDP for only the second quarter in its history at the end of 1995; by the end of last year it was greater than GDP by 181 per cent. </p> <p>The stock market boom has poured not billions of dollars into US' pockets, but trillions. In 1995-99 the net worth of US households rose by $15.7 trillion because of the appreciation of assets: largely shares, but also real estate. The appreciation in the value of household assets in 1999 alone was $4.5 trillion: equivalent to 48 per cent of GDP in the US, the world's biggest economy. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Americans feel much better off. Confidently, they have proceeded to the cashier. Consumer spending rose by 5.3 per cent in 1999 and by an annual rate of 8.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year. </p> <p>The savings rate has turned negative. Why save, after all? Why not borrow? Debt has increased: consumer and corporate debt has risen by 20 per cent in the past two years. The trade and current account deficits have risen to record levels. Property prices have been soaring. The US may have a new economy, reinventing itself technologically. It also has a vast consumer boom fed by euphoria. </p> <p>The consumer boom is one reason real GDP growth has averaged 4.2 per cent in the past three years: well above the level previously seen as the sustainable non-inflationary growth rate. Yet consumer price inflation has remained low. </p> <p>Some argue that high non-inflationary growth and high stock market valuations reflect a supremely healthy economy. They point, as people did in Britain in the Eighties, to a new paradigm and rapid growth in productivity. Greenspan himself does. They argue that the Fed has now made six successive interest rate rises to protect the economy from higher inflation. </p> <p>With the stock market losing steam, the wealth effect of rising assets has been checked and a so-called soft landing can now be achieved. </p> <p>These points have merit. Technological strides are changing the US economy. But while the new economy has dazzled, the more insidious enemy has not been perceived. For few of the most recent economic crises in countries around the world have been triggered by consumer price inflation. </p> <p>In Mexico, in Asia, in Russia, in Brazil, the main cause of crisis was financial speculation, overvalued assets and exchange rates and spiralling current account deficits: the phenomena seen in the US today. </p> <p>Japan's stock market rise in the Eighties is now seen as a damaging bubble. It inflated as Japan enjoyed the lowest consumer price inflation in the developed world. As in Japan or Britain in the Eight ies, a period of rapid economic change has coincided with a consumer boom nourished by financial speculation. </p> <p>Euphoria has hidden the whole truth. The truth is that it is not South Korea, not Britain, nor even Japan which is now sitting astride a monstrously inflated, ripe-to-burst bubble but the biggest economy in the world. When bubbles burst, euphoria disappears, and reality becomes painfully clear. The effects take years to overcome. Witness Japan. </p> <p>The blow to the wealth of consumers and investors is in proportion to the size of the bubble. Consumers and companies find they are less wealthy and cut spending. Growth falls; unemployment rises. Property prices fall. Owners may find their homes are worth less than their mortgages. Debt becomes a burden many cannot bear. </p> <p>The US may face some or all of this in the next few years, and the rest of the world economy is going to suffer too. Greenspan warned of irrational exuberance. But to tackle it without evidence that consumer price inflation was set to rise would have been unorthodox and controversial. Perhaps, after so many crises which have been triggered by asset price inflation, the orthodoxy needs to change. </p> <p>The new economy itself may have proved deceptive where inflation is concerned. New technology and working practices have improved the supply of goods and services, reducing many prices. Perhaps, in this period of technological advance, inflation rates should have been very low or even negative. </p> <p>Instead of raising rates, the Fed cut them three times in late 1998 to help prevent a seizing-up of capital markets and a worsening of the crisis then taking place in emerging economies. History may judge that policy a mistake. The longer a bubble builds, the bigger it becomes, and the louder the bang when it bursts. </p> <p>The Fed is turning now to its big guns. Too late. A more cautious line ought to have been taken on growth. Asset prices should not have been allowed to soar. Now the Fed's guns may prove as effective as those along the Maginot Line. </p> <p>\u0095 Ian Campbell was formerly chief Latin American economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, ABN AMRO Bank and BankBoston <a href=\"mailto:isc@eudoramail.com\"> isc@eudoramail.com</a>.</p>",

A paper on the circulation slide: a journalistic coup that dominates rivals' headlines, boosts sales, wins days of TV and radio follow-ups - and makes you a star. Enter Rebekah Wade with the anti-paedophile News Of The World. </p> <p>Is it ethically right to 'name and shame' week after week four dozen or so child molesters? Is that a reasonable role for a newspaper? This question became rhetorical when, on Friday afternoon, the newspaper announced it had suspended the naming and shaming process and claimed for itself a great victory having secured backing from all the major agencies for 'Sarah's Law'. </p> <p>Overnight rioting in Hampshire and the matter of another poor unfortunate being wrongly identified as among the guilty men will have had a bearing, but not one the NoW was keen to dwell on. </p> <p>Until that point on Friday Miss Wade saw probation officers and assorted police chiefs and criminologists coming. She commissioned a Mori poll (which gave her 88 per cent backing). </p> <p>She marshalled her own, supportive, experts. She pressed the button marked US and reiterated Megan's Law - the right for parents to know whether a child sex offender was living on their street. </p> <p>She warned time and again against vigilante retaliation. And, as a matter of principle, her liberal critics had a difficult row to hoe. They think it's wrong for MI5 or Special Branch to intercept your emails or bug your phones in secret.

      "bodyText": "It was the start every (very) young editor dreams of. A paper on the circulation slide: a journalistic coup that dominates rivals' headlines, boosts sales, wins days of TV and radio follow-ups - and makes you a star. Enter Rebekah Wade with the anti-paedophile News Of The World. Is it ethically right to 'name and shame' week after week four dozen or so child molesters? Is that a reasonable role for a newspaper? This question became rhetorical when, on Friday afternoon, the newspaper announced it had suspended the naming and shaming process and claimed for itself a great victory having secured backing from all the major agencies for 'Sarah's Law'. Overnight rioting in Hampshire and the matter of another poor unfortunate being wrongly identified as among the guilty men will have had a bearing, but not one the NoW was keen to dwell on. Until that point on Friday Miss Wade saw probation officers and assorted police chiefs and criminologists coming. She commissioned a Mori poll (which gave her 88 per cent backing). She marshalled her own, supportive, experts. She pressed the button marked US and reiterated Megan's Law - the right for parents to know whether a child sex offender was living on their street. She warned time and again against vigilante retaliation. And, as a matter of principle, her liberal critics had a difficult row to hoe. They think it's wrong for MI5 or Special Branch to intercept your emails or bug your phones in secret. How, then, can it be right for the police and social workers to be left in sole, secret charge of convicted paedophiles? But let us, for the sake of an argument unprolonged, leave these matters to commentators such as Simon Jenkins in the Times , noting merely that Wapping has its splits and vituperations like anywhere else. Let's be practical and take Rebekah's crusade at its own valuation. The paper stated this was 'the biggest public record of sex offenders ever seen in this country', launched 'in memory of Sarah Payne, whose murder broke every heart in Britain'. There are '110,000 proven paedophiles in Britain' - and 'we make a pledge that we will not stop until all 110,000 are named and shamed'. The arithmetic of such pledges, though, was rather daunting.

      "body": "<p>I stood in the Bisto-brown river, batting away the flies that had mistaken me for lunch. I didn't notice that Peter had sneaked around behind me, full of intent. He swung his powerful legs into the back of my knees, knocking me off my feet. I slid down into the water, head thrown back. Then he leapt upon me, nuzzling my face and neck. There was nothing to do but surrender. </p> <p>This may sound like a start of a Penny Vincenzi bestseller, but Peter is an orphaned giant river otter and I was swimming with him in the Rupununi river, deep in Guyana's rainforest. </p> <p>Only a handful of visitors have been to Dianne McTurk's otter refuge in this remote part of the jungle - we had spent hours in a cramped 4 x 4, then three and a half more in a boat on a day so hot I was grateful when a fellow traveller accidentally flicked rusty water across my face. </p> <p>Dianne is in her sixties, weathered by the sun, and, in her Herm\u00e9s scarf, as graceful as the long-necked birds that swoop around her river. She was born here, and despite flirtations with London (as press officer at the Savoy in the Fifties, she knew No\u00ebl Coward), and adventure (as a vaquero on a huge ranch), it was among the otters that she found her home. They are her family and she has developed a strange courtship language for them: 'Come my heart, come my love, my little you, my love bug.' </p> <p>Her house at Karanambu Ranch has no walls to speak of and no windows, just a roof and posts, and hammocks slung between. But there was electricity and (oh, luxury) hot water, which we had not experienced for days. </p> <p>A few days earlier, our group of seven travellers had flown out of the Guyanese capital Georgetown, leaving behind its jumble of faded, wooden buildings built by Dutch settlers. We bumped our way in a tiny plane over the dense rainforest, searching for a metaphor for what we saw below. It was broccoli, sprouting heads of green with the odd splash of purple. </p> <p>We landed 128 nautical miles later on a tiny airstrip, close to the magnificent Kaieteur Falls, which plunges in slow motion, turning into smoke as it hits the Potaro river below. </p> <p>Our base was a group of wooden huts that made up Iwokrama Field Station, set up 10 years ago to conserve and manage the rainforest, while supporting the people who live in and around it. Our guides, local Amerindians, suggested that after dinner they take us down the Essequibo river in dugouts to look for caiman, the alligators that populate South American rivers. We gulped. </p> <p>It was pitch black out there. Someone would talk them out of it, surely. </p> <p>An hour later, silvery ghost bats, black river bats and nightjars were swooping past our heads. The air was viscous with croakings and chirrupings and the slow whoosh of the oars. We could hear the distant roar of howler monkeys. We could hear our hearts beat. </p> <p>Suddenly, our guide swung his torch into a group of lianas that skimmed the river surface. In its midst a single scarlet eye gleamed back and, as we peered, the menacing head of the caiman came into focus, with teeth so numerous they spilled out of its generous mouth. Never smile at a crocodile? Not likely, guv. This 'vicious' beast was actually terrified of a group of gawping humans and it tried to convince us it was a log, holding perfectly still, hoping that we'd bugger off. </p> <p>On the way back someone plucked up the courage to ask out loud what we were all wondering on such a boiling night. Where could we get a cold beer? </p> <p>Now, that may seem an optimistic (OK, stupid) question to ask on a black river in the middle of the jungle, but it would have been more stupid not to ask because miracles do happen. A few miles upstream, it turned out, was a gold mine, and a small, rocky outcrop called Captain's Island boasted a bar of sorts which catered to the miners. Our guides were not convinced we'd be welcome... </p> <p>We arrived in the darkness and scrabbled up a heap of craggy boulders in search of the 'bar'. At the top was a thatched canopy held up by wooden posts and beneath it an undu lating dirt dancefloor. A few bored locals sat around the edges, and a couple of a Rastafarians moved in lacklustre fashion to the music. </p> <p>Drinks were served from behind a metal grille by a couple of tiny people, nonplussed at the appearance from nowhere of a bunch of grubby white people in jungle gear. </p> <p>Cooler and refreshed after a bottle of Banks, the local brew, and conscious of a pre-dawn start the next day, we decided to call it a night and headed back to the boat. </p> <p>Except the boat was no longer there. Our guide, it seemed, had got bored and headed home for a bath. He had promised to return, but neglected to mention when. We slunk back to the bar. </p> <p>The locals misinterpreted our reappearance as enthusiasm. A table appeared, on which was placed a bottle of El Dorado rum, fresh lime juice mixed with sugar, and seven shot glasses. Everyone was smiling and soon we were struttin' our funky stuff to Bob Marley's 'One Love'. The locals sportingly offered a 'good price' for a couple of hours with the women, and volunteered their own ladies for a bit of fun and frolics. Our boatman eventually returned - but was that a mischievous smile playing around his lips? </p> <p>Next day, we did some serious trekking to the top of Turtle Mountain, three and a half hours in sweltering heat. Our shirts were saturated and rivers of sweat poured down our faces. The jungle echoed with the wolf-whistles of the pyah bird, and the mora trees loomed above us with curved and twisted trunks. Electric blue butterflies drifted by. </p> <p>Despite the beauty, we were feeling apprehensive. That night would be spent in hammocks in the middle of the forest, with just a mosquito net for protection, no loo, strange noises, spiders and snakes and bugs, and maybe, just maybe, jaguar...</p> <p>Then we arrived in a small clearing that looked more like the set for A Midsummer Night's Dream than a jungle nightmare. Hammocks were slung under a tarpaulin. The sun dappled through the trees , and the Burro Burro river sashayed languorously by. Perhaps we would survive. A group of Amerindians made us dinner of eddo (a bit like potatoes), beef stew, fish parcels, smoky spinach and bora beans. Our faces around the table in the firelight were illuminated like some strange jungle version of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. When we climbed into the hammocks, they were so close that we could rock each other to sleep. </p> <p>The head of the Amerindian community, Sydney Allicott, had invited us to his village, Surama, next morning. He took us to the school, a joint project with the United Nations Children's Fund, and led us to its hall. The children stared, and no wonder. We looked dirty, sweaty and half savage, while they were in immaculate cotton uniforms. </p> <p>The teacher asked them to sing, and they began shyly: 'Surama sitting in the valley, Surama you make me feel so happy.' Sleep deprivation and sensory overload combined, and we were all wiping away tears. A couple of days later, the air-conditioned comfort of our hotel in Georgetown felt a world away. </p> <p>Guyana is about the size of Britain, but poor: despite having gold and diamonds, most money is made from bauxite and sugar. The government used to be reluctant to encourage tourism, fearing bloated, white elitists whining about malaria. </p> <p>And we were afraid to go. Most guidebooks emphasise the risk of disease or crime in Georgetown. But attitudes are changing. </p> <p>Don't go to Guyana's rainforest if you really want electricity, hot showers, dental floss, gin and tonic or sleep. But if you want to swim with a giant otter, to see the red eye of the caiman at night and hear the singing of Amerindian children in the morning, be brave. You won't regret it. </p> <p>\u2022 A seven-night package to Guyana and Barbados is available from the Travel Shop, 2 Selkirk Road, London SW17 (020 8682 1115) and costs \u00a31,101.

      "bodyText": "I stood in the Bisto-brown river, batting away the flies that had mistaken me for lunch. I didn't notice that Peter had sneaked around behind me, full of intent. He swung his powerful legs into the back of my knees, knocking me off my feet. I slid down into the water, head thrown back. Then he leapt upon me, nuzzling my face and neck. There was nothing to do but surrender. This may sound like a start of a Penny Vincenzi bestseller, but Peter is an orphaned giant river otter and I was swimming with him in the Rupununi river, deep in Guyana's rainforest. Only a handful of visitors have been to Dianne McTurk's otter refuge in this remote part of the jungle - we had spent hours in a cramped 4 x 4, then three and a half more in a boat on a day so hot I was grateful when a fellow traveller accidentally flicked rusty water across my face. Dianne is in her sixties, weathered by the sun, and, in her Herm\u00e9s scarf, as graceful as the long-necked birds that swoop around her river. She was born here, and despite flirtations with London (as press officer at the Savoy in the Fifties, she knew No\u00ebl Coward), and adventure (as a vaquero on a huge ranch), it was among the otters that she found her home. They are her family and she has developed a strange courtship language for them: 'Come my heart, come my love, my little you, my love bug.' Her house at Karanambu Ranch has no walls to speak of and no windows, just a roof and posts, and hammocks slung between. But there was electricity and (oh, luxury) hot water, which we had not experienced for days. A few days earlier, our group of seven travellers had flown out of the Guyanese capital Georgetown, leaving behind its jumble of faded, wooden buildings built by Dutch settlers. We bumped our way in a tiny plane over the dense rainforest, searching for a metaphor for what we saw below. It was broccoli, sprouting heads of green with the odd splash of purple. We landed 128 nautical miles later on a tiny airstrip, close to the magnificent Kaieteur Falls, which plunges in slow motion, turning into smoke as it hits the Potaro river below. Our base was a group of wooden huts that made up Iwokrama Field Station, set up 10 years ago to conserve and manage the rainforest, while supporting the people who live in and around it. Our guides, local Amerindians, suggested that after dinner they take us down the Essequibo river in dugouts to look for caiman, the alligators that populate South American rivers. We gulped. It was pitch black out there. Someone would talk them out of it, surely. An hour later, silvery ghost bats, black river bats and nightjars were swooping past our heads. The air was viscous with croakings and chirrupings and the slow whoosh of the oars. We could hear the distant roar of howler monkeys. We could hear our hearts beat. Suddenly, our guide swung his torch into a group of lianas that skimmed the river surface. In its midst a single scarlet eye gleamed back and, as we peered, the menacing head of the caiman came into focus, with teeth so numerous they spilled out of its generous mouth. Never smile at a crocodile? Not likely, guv. This 'vicious' beast was actually terrified of a group of gawping humans and it tried to convince us it was a log, holding perfectly still, hoping that we'd bugger off. On the way back someone plucked up the courage to ask out loud what we were all wondering on such a boiling night. Where could we get a cold beer? Now, that may seem an optimistic (OK, stupid) question to ask on a black river in the middle of the jungle, but it would have been more stupid not to ask because miracles do happen. A few miles upstream, it turned out, was a gold mine, and a small, rocky outcrop called Captain's Island boasted a bar of sorts which catered to the miners. Our guides were not convinced we'd be welcome... We arrived in the darkness and scrabbled up a heap of craggy boulders in search of the 'bar'. At the top was a thatched canopy held up by wooden posts and beneath it an undu lating dirt dancefloor. A few bored locals sat around the edges, and a couple of a Rastafarians moved in lacklustre fashion to the music. Drinks were served from behind a metal grille by a couple of tiny people, nonplussed at the appearance from nowhere of a bunch of grubby white people in jungle gear. Cooler and refreshed after a bottle of Banks, the local brew, and conscious of a pre-dawn start the next day, we decided to call it a night and headed back to the boat. Except the boat was no longer there. Our guide, it seemed, had got bored and headed home for a bath. He had promised to return, but neglected to mention when. We slunk back to the bar. The locals misinterpreted our reappearance as enthusiasm. A table appeared, on which was placed a bottle of El Dorado rum, fresh lime juice mixed with sugar, and seven shot glasses. Everyone was smiling and soon we were struttin' our funky stuff to Bob Marley's 'One Love'. The locals sportingly offered a 'good price' for a couple of hours with the women, and volunteered their own ladies for a bit of fun and frolics. Our boatman eventually returned - but was that a mischievous smile playing around his lips? Next day, we did some serious trekking to the top of Turtle Mountain, three and a half hours in sweltering heat. Our shirts were saturated and rivers of sweat poured down our faces. The jungle echoed with the wolf-whistles of the pyah bird, and the mora trees loomed above us with curved and twisted trunks. Electric blue butterflies drifted by. Despite the beauty, we were feeling apprehensive. That night would be spent in hammocks in the middle of the forest, with just a mosquito net for protection, no loo, strange noises, spiders and snakes and bugs, and maybe, just maybe, jaguar... Then we arrived in a small clearing that looked more like the set for A Midsummer Night's Dream than a jungle nightmare. Hammocks were slung under a tarpaulin. The sun dappled through the trees , and the Burro Burro river sashayed languorously by. Perhaps we would survive. A group of Amerindians made us dinner of eddo (a bit like potatoes), beef stew, fish parcels, smoky spinach and bora beans. Our faces around the table in the firelight were illuminated like some strange jungle version of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. When we climbed into the hammocks, they were so close that we could rock each other to sleep. The head of the Amerindian community, Sydney Allicott, had invited us to his village, Surama, next morning. He took us to the school, a joint project with the United Nations Children's Fund, and led us to its hall. The children stared, and no wonder. We looked dirty, sweaty and half savage, while they were in immaculate cotton uniforms. The teacher asked them to sing, and they began shyly: 'Surama sitting in the valley, Surama you make me feel so happy.' Sleep deprivation and sensory overload combined, and we were all wiping away tears. A couple of days later, the air-conditioned comfort of our hotel in Georgetown felt a world away. Guyana is about the size of Britain, but poor: despite having gold and diamonds, most money is made from bauxite and sugar. The government used to be reluctant to encourage tourism, fearing bloated, white elitists whining about malaria. And we were afraid to go. Most guidebooks emphasise the risk of disease or crime in Georgetown. But attitudes are changing. Don't go to Guyana's rainforest if you really want electricity, hot showers, dental floss, gin and tonic or sleep. But if you want to swim with a giant otter, to see the red eye of the caiman at night and hear the singing of Amerindian children in the morning, be brave. You won't regret it. \u2022 A seven-night package to Guyana and Barbados is available from the Travel Shop, 2 Selkirk Road, London SW17 (020 8682 1115) and costs \u00a31,101.

      "body": "<p> <strong>1 Tomas Brolin</strong> <br> In Euro 92, England fell to a superb goal from a hugely promising young Swedish striker. Eight years on, the scorer, now a vacuum-cleaner salesman based in Stockholm, could only reflect on a career which went grindingly wrong. Tomas Brolin at his peak was graceful, skillful and captivating. Past it, he was one of the most limited players in world football. The decline set in soon after Euro 92, but apparently went unnoticed by then Leeds boss George Graham, who paid Parma \u00a34.5m for him in 1995. When Brolin arrived looking like Keith Chegwin's tubby twin, Graham was panic-stricken. Brolin made just 19 appearances in two years before his career collapsed amidst a series of training ground walk-outs and dietary rumours. Leeds paid out the remainder of his contract. He returned to England for a final Premiership fling at Crystal Palace in 1998, but, after 13 appearances, was deemed too fat to play, and made assistant manager to Attilio Lombardo when Steve Coppell was moved aside. Palace were instantly relegated - Brolin hasn't been seen in this country since. <strong>2 Ali Dia</strong> <br> The Jeffrey Archer of Premiership imports arrived at Southampton in 1996 after convincing then-manager Graeme Souness that he was a top quality 30-year-old Senegalese striker with 13 international caps, carrying a recommendation from former Paris St Germain teammate George Weah. Plainly, he wasn't - but Souness's curiosity got the better of him. Dia was signed and brought on as a substitute against Leeds. After a superbly inept 53 minutes he was brought off again, and, 14 days after agreeing it, his contract was cancelled. 'I don't feel I have been duped in the slightest,' explained Souness afterwards. 'That's just the way the world is these days.' From Southampton, the japester joined non-league Gateshead, where he was transfer-listed in February 1997. He hasn't been heard of since. <strong>3 Andrea Silenzi</strong> <br> Signed for \u00a31.8m by Frank Clark for Nottingham Forest in 1995, 6'3\" Silenzi took just seven full appearances to prove his worth. One of the first 'big name' Italian imports, Silenzi, known as 'the Big Brush', was a picture of disinterest. Earning a then-enormous \u00a330,000 a month, his laid-back control, finishing and approach play soon had management and supporters worried. His only excess was in the length of his first touch. It took just weeks for the deal to look suspect, a month for it to look plain wrong and another to collapse. Half way through his first season, he had lost his place to Jason Lee, was loaned to Venezia, and when told to return by Dave Bassett, refused. Forest tore up his contract - meaning the whole deal, including wages and bonuses, had cost the club \u00a32.75m. He scored twice - one against Oxford in the FA Cup and the other against Bradford in the Coca Cola cup. 'The whole business turned into a complete fiasco,' said Bassett. <strong>4 Michele Padovano</strong> <br> Former Crystal Palace chairman Mark Goldberg, author of the club's recent near-death experience, signed Padovano from Juventus reserves in November 1997 for \u00a31.7m in a typically ill-considered move. Handing the Italian an enormous contract in the hope that gratitude alone would spur him to score the goals to beat relegation, Goldberg touted his newest expensive arrival as the answer to Palace's prayers. In the event, the long-haired, out-of-condition forward scored once, appeared twelve times, and came to embody the club's failings. Utterly disinterested, Padovano never played more than two games in a row, and, after his twelfth appearance, settled contentedly into reserve team football, before leaving on a free to join Metz. He made a brief return visit earlier this year once the club had fallen into the hands of administrators to claim a reported \u00a31m in unpaid wages. <strong> 5 Marco Boogers </strong> <br> Harry Redknapp wasn't always the streetwise London gaffer he is today. The arrival of 'Mad' Marco Boogers for \u00a31m from Sparta Rotterdam in July 1995 was just one of a number of misjudged West Ham imports. Coming on as a substitute against Manchester United in only his second appearance for the club, Boogers was almost immediately red carded for 'a sickening horror tackle' (The Sun) on Gary Neville. He promptly disappeared, discovered several weeks later hiding in a mobile home in a Dutch caravan park. The Boogers debacle, which ended in a loan deal and subsequent free transfer to Groningen despite his protestations - 'I'm not mental' - was the worst of a dreadful Redknapp collection: Florin Raducioiu arrived for \u00a32.4m in July 96 and was sold at a \u00a3600,000 loss six months later after missing training for a Harvey Nichols shopping trip; Portuguese supermodel Dani lasted five months before being thrown out for excessive nightclubbing; and \u00a32m star Javier Margas went missing in February last year, turning up later at home in Chile. He, unlike Boogers, did come back. <strong>6 Brian Pinas</strong> <br> A member of a select group of players capable of inspiring an entry in The Sun Says by the power of their name alone - Stefan Kuntz, Celta Vigo's Turdo and Sparta Prague's Milan Fukal wait their turn - Dutch winger Pinas survived 12 months in Newcastle's reserves before returning, broken, to Feyenoord. Greeted on his arrival in August 1998 by the Sun's editorial ('Pity soccer star Brian Pinas. The first time a referee takes his name he'll get sent off for using foul language'), the winger made one substitute appearance in a pre-season friendly against Birmingham before disappearing for good into reserve team football. He was sold back to Feyenoord in 1999, Newcastle making \u00a3200,000 from the deal. However, confidence shattered by a year's worth of jokes, he failed to settle, and was quickly sold on to feeder club Excelsior in the Dutch second division. <strong>7 Marco Negri</strong> <br> Every week, Marco Negri, Rangers long-serving reserve team striker, earns an estimated \u00a318,000. As, at the start of this season, he hadn't kicked a ball for Rangers in 26 months, with the exception of a brief substitute appearance against Morton in the Scottish Cup, that's almost \u00a32m banked for no return. He arrived from Perugia for \u00a33.5m in June 1997 under Walter Smith, scoring a phenomenal 23 goals in ten games - the best strike rate in Europe. But the warning signs were already there: Negri refused to celebrate his goals with more than a handshake, and managed to look aloof even while hitting the back of the net. He socialised only with full-back Sergio Porrini, with whom he played squash. During one of their matches, Negri was hit in the eye, and was out injured for weeks; once he recovered, his first team appearances were few and far between. Last month, now under Dick Advocaat, he played in the Rangers youth team that lost a pre-season friendly to East Fife. But with another \u00a318,000 in the bank, he's not complaining. </p> <p><strong>8 Alberto Tarantini</strong></p> <p> Known chiefly for his haircut and temper, Alberto Tarantini was by far the least successful of England's 1970's Argentinian imports. Skilful on the ball but with no positional sense or discipline, his year at Birmingham City was fiercely unhappy - particularly given his pedigree as a World Cup winner. Whereas Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa made a positive mark at Spurs, Tarantini came and went in 23 games, with little or no footballing consequence. His career in England anded in 1987 after he waded into a home crowd for a punch up - a little publicised precursor to Eric Cantona's efforts at Selhurst Park 17 years later. At \u00a3295,000 from Boca Juniors, he was one of the first great foreign flops.<br> <strong>9 Stephane Guivarc'h</strong> <br> Stephane Guivarc'h features strongly among a convincing list of Newcastle contenders. Signed by Kenny Dalglish for \u00a33.5m in 1998 and instantly belittled by successor Ruud Gullit, the French World Cup winner moved on to Rangers for another brief, miserable spell. He returned to Auxerre for \u00a33.5m last summer, having collected substantial signing-on fees due to him from both clubs. 'I knew I could leave Rangers via an escape clause,' he said. 'I made sure of that after my experience at Newcastle.' Today, Guivarc'h is notable only for the interesting apostrophe between the c and h in his surname - the relic of Breton, a language once spoken by half-a-million Celts, and meaning 'swift stallion'. <strong>10 Savo Milosevic</strong> <br> Yugoslavia's hero in Euro 2000 was a disaster at Aston Villa. Cleverly nicknamed 'Miss-a-lot-evic' by the tabloids, his finishing and approach play at Villa Park eventually left Brian Little, who signed him from Partizan Belgrade for \u00a33.5m, unemployed. Villa fans failed to take to him despite 28 goals in 90 games, including the winner in the club's League Cup final victory over Leeds. The pressure became too much. After spitting flamboyantly at his own fans in Villa's 5-0 defeat to Blackburn he was put on the transfer list and sold to Real Zaragoza for \u00a33.5m at the end of the season, where he recovered his form. Now he's off to Parma for \u00a316m. <strong>This month's 10 were selected by Observer football writer David Hills. Here he explains his choice:</strong></p> <p>Is this the definitive list? Probably not - it's a wholly subjective set, with tens of candidates for every club currently or recently in the Premiership. On balance, foreign imports have had a largely positive impact on the standard of top flight British football, particularly in attitudes to training, quality of performance and professionalism. But, inescapably, looking through recent arrivals, for every Nwankwo, there's a Pinas. Or more likely, two. We've gone for a broad range to capture the whole genre - covering overrated, over-paid and overweight players, plus those who earn a place for bizarre press coverage or behaviour alone. No-one, we're confident, can dispute the choice of Tomas Brolin as number one. Although essentially a nice man - articulate, friendly, largely decent - he's also a darkly comic figure (an image he's since turned to his commercial advantage with his burgeoning online shoe and hoover-nozzle outlet). At Crystal Palace - at a time when few Palace players possessed great credibility - Brolin slipped effortlessly between sublime, ridiculous and tragic, and made stretching for lost-causes an artform.<br> Bizarre teammates at the time, including the bearded Sasa Curcic (who famously held an on-pitch protest against the Nato bombing of Kosovo), couldn't keep up. Others earn their place in the list on less endearing grounds. Nottingham Forest's Andrea Silenzi was the first indication of the destructive force free-loading foreign imports could be: making a mockery of his manager, fans and colleagues, and flouncing home with enormous sums of money. Massimo Taibi was clearly a contender, left out only on the grounds that being a bad goalkeeper is too easy. Those who have earned a place on our list developed and realised awfulness on an altogether more concerted scale.</p>",

Now he's off to Parma for \u00a316m. This month's 10 were selected by Observer football writer David Hills. Here he explains his choice: Is this the definitive list? Probably not - it's a wholly subjective set, with tens of candidates for every club currently or recently in the Premiership. On balance, foreign imports have had a largely positive impact on the standard of top flight British football, particularly in attitudes to training, quality of performance and professionalism. But, inescapably, looking through recent arrivals, for every Nwankwo, there's a Pinas. Or more likely, two. We've gone for a broad range to capture the whole genre - covering overrated, over-paid and overweight players, plus those who earn a place for bizarre press coverage or behaviour alone. No-one, we're confident, can dispute the choice of Tomas Brolin as number one. Although essentially a nice man - articulate, friendly, largely decent - he's also a darkly comic figure (an image he's since turned to his commercial advantage with his burgeoning online shoe and hoover-nozzle outlet). At Crystal Palace - at a time when few Palace players possessed great credibility - Brolin slipped effortlessly between sublime, ridiculous and tragic, and made stretching for lost-causes an artform. Bizarre teammates at the time, including the bearded Sasa Curcic (who famously held an on-pitch protest against the Nato bombing of Kosovo), couldn't keep up. Others earn their place in the list on less endearing grounds. Nottingham Forest's Andrea Silenzi was the first indication of the destructive force free-loading foreign imports could be: making a mockery of his manager, fans and colleagues, and flouncing home with enormous sums of money. Massimo Taibi was clearly a contender, left out only on the grounds that being a bad goalkeeper is too easy. Those who have earned a place on our list developed and realised awfulness on an altogether more concerted scale.",

      "body": "<p>Anyone remotely interested in good eating needs to be pro-Europe. I mean, when did you last buy a bottle of British extra-virgin olive oil or squeeze a sun-ripened Welsh lemon over your potted shrimps? How drab our cooking would be without the bold flavours and simple cooking of the sunnier bits of Europe. </p> <p>And how easy it is for the mathematically challenged like myself to shop and cook with a sleek European metric system based on 10's rather than the awkward 16's of that mess known as the imperial system. Of course there are those who choose not to notice that our cooking is going places - while the suits at Waitrose commit themselves wholeheartedly to organic produce and Sainsbury signs up the groovy Jamie Oliver, dear old Tesco has reverted to showing pounds and ounces in their stores. But even the most deep-rooted Anglophile could surely fail to be moved by just one mouthful of the garlic-scented toasted bread known as bruschetta. Or, for the benefit of the decision-makers at Tesco, 'something-foreign-on-toast'. </p> <p>Bruschetta is Euro-toast. This doesn't mean the untanned, bendy stuff you get with your breakfast Nescaf\u00e9 in Greece (how do they get it like that?), but thick slices of golden, open-textured bread rubbed with garlic and drizzled with olive oil. You find it in different guises everywhere from Bologna to Birmingham, but it hails from Italy. Unlike a round of Hovis, bruschetta positively reeks of sunshine and will cheer up this dismal, mean little summer. </p> <p>You can have it plain, if you can call crusty Tuscan bread dripping with unctuous oil plain, or you can chuck any sun-ripened ingredient from tomatoes to aubergines on it. The only rule is that it should taste of the sun. By which I suppose I mean it should have seen some fruity olive oil and young garlic. Whereas there is much safety in Britain's dowdy poached-egg-on-toast, there is an unmistakable joie de vivre in even the simplest bruschetta. </p> <p>Strictly speaking, bruschetta is nowt but toasted bread, garlic and olive oil and is what the Italians in the north call fettunta or panunto. At its most splendid, when eaten with pungent new oil, it is the star of the show at the festa that follows the first autumn pressing of the new season's olives. As the oil flows from the press, thick wedges of the grilled bread ( bruscare means 'to grill') are rubbed with juicy garlic cloves and doused with the warmly vibrant oil. </p> <p>The bread you use will depend on what you can get, but an open-textured white loaf such as the saltless pane toscano or even ciabatta is perfect - its open texture soaks up the emerald liquid like a sponge. I often use a sourdough loaf for the little snap of yeasty astringency that comes with it. </p> <p>Anyone who has wondered exactly when to use that absurdly expensive bottle of estate bottled olive oil they purchased in a rash moment might like to use it now. There is no better way of getting the full fruity onslaught of the oil than here. The idea is to slice the bread thicker than you would for something-on-toast and to grill it so that the edges char here and there. You want the crust to be crisp, the inside moist and steamy. The garlic must be new. This doesn't necessarily mean green, just plump with plenty of sweet, mild juice. </p> <p>The trick is to pick a plump clove from a tight head and cut in half widthwise. Push the cut side down on the surface of the toast and scrape it across the rough bread. You won't get a fat lot of juice from it. In fact, you may wonder why you bothered - until you taste it. We are after more than a whiff but less than a stink here. Now douse it with oil. Some of it will dribble through the holes, so mind your clothes, but you should use enough that you can almost suck the oil from the bread. This is why it is essential that the oil you choose is one you love rather simply like. </p> <p>We shouldn't stop here. The tomatoes that have finally seen a bit of sun will do, well squashed with salt and black pepper and piled on to this hot toast. This is one occasion when I don't mind the skins. My favourite at the moment is a bruschetta of roasted aubergine, garlic and feta cheese (see recipe). It's highly inauthentic, of course, but authenticity isn't always all it's cracked up to be. No one can tell me that velvet aubergine, sweet garlic, crisp hot toast and salty white cheese isn't a good eat. </p> <p>We are talking about big flavours - the anchovies, tomatoes, garlic, peppery olive oils and olives so redolent of the hotter parts of Europe. There is nothing refined about this sort of toast - this is not breakfast at the vicarage. Generosity is as much an ingredient here as the bread itself. I have taken to having a slice of bruschetta for lunch - it is the best use for a ciabatta I know. If the simplicity of the bread and oil doesn't appeal, then you can get carried away: try adding a little crushed dried chilli to the oil or a few spikes of young rosemary and thyme leaves, very finely chopped. </p> <p>Tomatoes, either skinned and chopped or roasted till soft and sweet, are an obvious contender to sit astride your hot toast, though even that isn't strictly necessary. I would also vote for crushed anchovies tossed with greens such as rocket, or even some mushrooms cooked in a little butter and oil with thyme and lemon, piled lavishly on top. I have used a sweet bread such as a buttermilk loaf or panettone as a base for summer fruits - lusciously ripe peaches or apricots, say - and have even been known to smother my toast in a richly purple compote of warm summer berries. Big-flavoured, full of sunshine and simple to do. Not very British, I'm afraid. </p> <p><strong> Bruschetta with roasted aubergine, basil and feta</strong><br> </p> <p> Serves 2 </p> <p>2 medium-sized aubergines </p> <p>extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>8 cloves of garlic </p> <p>half a lemon </p> <p>a good handful of basil leaves </p> <p>100g feta </p> <p>4 thick slices of bread from an interesting loaf </p> <p>handful of olives </p> <p>Wipe the aubergines - a pleasing task - and cut off their prickly stems. Slice the fruit in half lengthways, then cut each half lengthways into four. Chop each piece widthways into five or six short, fat pieces and throw them into a baking dish with a good half-cupful of olive oil. Tuck the garlic, unpeeled, in among the aubergines, then squeeze over the lemon and toss it all together with a grinding of salt and pepper (I leave the squeezed shell in with the aubergines). Bake for 50 minutes or so at 200 C/gas mark 6, turning it once or twice, until the aubergine is golden. </p> <p>Tear up the basil leaves and toss them with the aubergine and the feta, roughly crumbled. Squeeze the garlic from its skin - you won't get much, but what you get will be sweet and mellow. Toast or grill the bread - you want some crusty, blackened edges, I think - squash the garlic over, then drizzle the olive oil from the baking dish over the toast, and divide the aubergine and feta between them.

      "bodyText": "Anyone remotely interested in good eating needs to be pro-Europe. I mean, when did you last buy a bottle of British extra-virgin olive oil or squeeze a sun-ripened Welsh lemon over your potted shrimps? How drab our cooking would be without the bold flavours and simple cooking of the sunnier bits of Europe. And how easy it is for the mathematically challenged like myself to shop and cook with a sleek European metric system based on 10's rather than the awkward 16's of that mess known as the imperial system. Of course there are those who choose not to notice that our cooking is going places - while the suits at Waitrose commit themselves wholeheartedly to organic produce and Sainsbury signs up the groovy Jamie Oliver, dear old Tesco has reverted to showing pounds and ounces in their stores. But even the most deep-rooted Anglophile could surely fail to be moved by just one mouthful of the garlic-scented toasted bread known as bruschetta. Or, for the benefit of the decision-makers at Tesco, 'something-foreign-on-toast'. Bruschetta is Euro-toast. This doesn't mean the untanned, bendy stuff you get with your breakfast Nescaf\u00e9 in Greece (how do they get it like that?), but thick slices of golden, open-textured bread rubbed with garlic and drizzled with olive oil. You find it in different guises everywhere from Bologna to Birmingham, but it hails from Italy. Unlike a round of Hovis, bruschetta positively reeks of sunshine and will cheer up this dismal, mean little summer. You can have it plain, if you can call crusty Tuscan bread dripping with unctuous oil plain, or you can chuck any sun-ripened ingredient from tomatoes to aubergines on it. The only rule is that it should taste of the sun. By which I suppose I mean it should have seen some fruity olive oil and young garlic. Whereas there is much safety in Britain's dowdy poached-egg-on-toast, there is an unmistakable joie de vivre in even the simplest bruschetta. Strictly speaking, bruschetta is nowt but toasted bread, garlic and olive oil and is what the Italians in the north call fettunta or panunto. At its most splendid, when eaten with pungent new oil, it is the star of the show at the festa that follows the first autumn pressing of the new season's olives. As the oil flows from the press, thick wedges of the grilled bread ( bruscare means 'to grill') are rubbed with juicy garlic cloves and doused with the warmly vibrant oil. The bread you use will depend on what you can get, but an open-textured white loaf such as the saltless pane toscano or even ciabatta is perfect - its open texture soaks up the emerald liquid like a sponge. I often use a sourdough loaf for the little snap of yeasty astringency that comes with it. Anyone who has wondered exactly when to use that absurdly expensive bottle of estate bottled olive oil they purchased in a rash moment might like to use it now. There is no better way of getting the full fruity onslaught of the oil than here. The idea is to slice the bread thicker than you would for something-on-toast and to grill it so that the edges char here and there. You want the crust to be crisp, the inside moist and steamy.

      "body": "<p>They say a week is a long time in politics, but it can seem like an eternity in football. This time last week I was happily director of youth at Fulham, with magnificent facilities and a thriving set-up. By Sunday evening I had been asked to return to Crystal Palace as manager, by Monday I had accepted and on Tuesday I was appointed formally. </p> <p>Wednesday was my first day at the training ground, and the first thing that struck me was how shabby things were compared with Fulham and the Palace I had left five years ago after my previous stint as manager. </p> <p>The players have been using the same training kit every day for the past two years, they did not have proper training shoes for track work and even the food they are given is not as good as it could be. The reason, of course, is that Palace are just emerging from almost two years of darkness following Mark Goldberg's takeover. The club has spent most of the past 16 months in administration, a situation that was resolved only last month when Simon Jordan bought the club. </p> <p>Jordan is clearly no mug and determined not to make the same mistakes as Goldberg. At 32, he is worth about \u00a390 million, having sold his mobile phone business that ran to 500 or so shops and thousands of staff. So he knows a thing or two about keeping the customer happy, and the first thing we have to do is to give Palace's customers - the fans - something to shout about. </p> <p>I will not pretend it is going to be easy. There is still a slightly downbeat atmosphere about the place, and my first task is to get across to the players the fact that we are no longer in administration - in fact I have banned the use of that word. </p> <p>After the fall of communism it took the East Germans, for example, a long time to start thinking in the same way as their western counterparts, even once they were unified. There was a still a mental and cultural time lag, and it is a bit like that at Palace. </p> <p>Yet we have to start thinking positively, and change things quickly, with the season just a week away. I have set out a three-stage plan, covering the short, medium and long term. </p> <p>In the short term I have to get the players up to the standard of fitness I require quickly. We think their fitness levels are equivalent to the second week of pre-season training, not the fifth, so that has to be remedied. But you can only do so much. For example, without good nutritious food you cannot expect players to do two full training sessions a day, which is what I want. </p> <p>Up to now, the canteen food has been bought with cheapness rather than qual ity in mind, and that will change straightaway. We are also buying new training kit, track shoes, and getting a new executive-style coach for away travel so that the players can have more self-esteem - after all, they have been made to feel like second-class citizens for the past season or two. </p> <p>In the medium term, I predict it will take me three months to get the players as fit as I want. I won't change the training programme too much because that could be disruptive, and I will not rush out and buy new players without assessing fully the ones we have here. </p> <p>Adding to the squad is part of my longer-term plan, as well as moving to a new training ground with improved facilities, especially for the youth academy. Palace has been a good breeding ground for young players for the past 25 years, and we must not let that slip. </p> <p>There are good young players coming through and some are already in the first team. That is something I want to develop as I did at Fulham, where Jean Tigana is already exerting his continental influence. </p> <p>Some people might say that I have jumped from a Le Creuset frying pan into a south London cauldron, but I don't see it that way. </p> <p>The situation at Palace now is very similar to how it was at Fulham when I went there three years ago. Mohammed al-Fayed had just taken over and had big ideas about getting into the Premiership, but first we had to move up the divisions. I've learnt from working with people like Kevin Keegan, Karlheinz Riedle and Jean Tigana, and I've studied leading European clubs at close quarters. </p> <p>But I do not expect to win the First Division title in my first season, as we did when I was first manager six years ago. I would say, though, that I think we can make a play-off place and then who knows what can happen? We certainly have a bigger fan base than Fulham, for example, and have the potential to get crowds of more than 20,000 into Selhurst Park for each game. </p> <p>The chairman has got things moving rapidly in the commercial sense, and now it is my turn to change our fortunes on the field. I feel very positive and excited about the season ahead and hopefully we will get everyone at the club thinking on the same wavelength. Once the players, staff and supporters start to see positive things happening, hopefully they will start to believe we can go forward.</p>",

By Sunday evening I had been asked to return to Crystal Palace as manager, by Monday I had accepted and on Tuesday I was appointed formally. Wednesday was my first day at the training ground, and the first thing that struck me was how shabby things were compared with Fulham and the Palace I had left five years ago after my previous stint as manager. The players have been using the same training kit every day for the past two years, they did not have proper training shoes for track work and even the food they are given is not as good as it could be. The reason, of course, is that Palace are just emerging from almost two years of darkness following Mark Goldberg's takeover. The club has spent most of the past 16 months in administration, a situation that was resolved only last month when Simon Jordan bought the club. Jordan is clearly no mug and determined not to make the same mistakes as Goldberg. At 32, he is worth about \u00a390 million, having sold his mobile phone business that ran to 500 or so shops and thousands of staff. So he knows a thing or two about keeping the customer happy, and the first thing we have to do is to give Palace's customers - the fans - something to shout about. I will not pretend it is going to be easy. There is still a slightly downbeat atmosphere about the place, and my first task is to get across to the players the fact that we are no longer in administration - in fact I have banned the use of that word. After the fall of communism it took the East Germans, for example, a long time to start thinking in the same way as their western counterparts, even once they were unified. There was a still a mental and cultural time lag, and it is a bit like that at Palace. Yet we have to start thinking positively, and change things quickly, with the season just a week away. I have set out a three-stage plan, covering the short, medium and long term. In the short term I have to get the players up to the standard of fitness I require quickly. We think their fitness levels are equivalent to the second week of pre-season training, not the fifth, so that has to be remedied. But you can only do so much. For example, without good nutritious food you cannot expect players to do two full training sessions a day, which is what I want. Up to now, the canteen food has been bought with cheapness rather than qual ity in mind, and that will change straightaway. We are also buying new training kit, track shoes, and getting a new executive-style coach for away travel so that the players can have more self-esteem - after all, they have been made to feel like second-class citizens for the past season or two. In the medium term, I predict it will take me three months to get the players as fit as I want. I won't change the training programme too much because that could be disruptive, and I will not rush out and buy new players without assessing fully the ones we have here. Adding to the squad is part of my longer-term plan, as well as moving to a new training ground with improved facilities, especially for the youth academy. Palace has been a good breeding ground for young players for the past 25 years, and we must not let that slip. There are good young players coming through and some are already in the first team. That is something I want to develop as I did at Fulham, where Jean Tigana is already exerting his continental influence. Some people might say that I have jumped from a Le Creuset frying pan into a south London cauldron, but I don't see it that way. The situation at Palace now is very similar to how it was at Fulham when I went there three years ago. Mohammed al-Fayed had just taken over and had big ideas about getting into the Premiership, but first we had to move up the divisions. I've learnt from working with people like Kevin Keegan, Karlheinz Riedle and Jean Tigana, and I've studied leading European clubs at close quarters. But I do not expect to win the First Division title in my first season, as we did when I was first manager six years ago. I would say, though, that I think we can make a play-off place and then who knows what can happen? We certainly have a bigger fan base than Fulham, for example, and have the potential to get crowds of more than 20,000 into Selhurst Park for each game. The chairman has got things moving rapidly in the commercial sense, and now it is my turn to change our fortunes on the field. I feel very positive and excited about the season ahead and hopefully we will get everyone at the club thinking on the same wavelength. Once the players, staff and supporters start to see positive things happening, hopefully they will start to believe we can go forward.",
