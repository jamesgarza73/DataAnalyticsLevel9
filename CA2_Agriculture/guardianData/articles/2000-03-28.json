      "bodyText": "The Famous Adventures of Jack by Berlie Doherty Published by Hodder Children's Books \u00a310.99 hb, \u00a33.99 pb A girl walks into a cottage and asks for Jack. \"Which Jack did you want?\" asks the old woman inside. \"They're 10 a penny, Jacks are.\" Ten a penny - but all extraordinary. Clever Jacks, daft Jacks, Jacks who kill giants. . . Familiar and not so familiar Jacks all turn up in this clever weaving together of a series of short stories. Then there are the talking cats, disappearing castles - and don't forget the magic beans. Ingeniously splicing the old and the new, this is a book that plays on children's familiarity with fairy tales and which celebrates our need to hear old stories in a new ways.",

His pace - and he was genuinely rapid at times - has slowed but he will still be in England this summer to torture with his deadly ability to move the ball away from the right-hander from wide of the crease and a change of pace which is so well disguised that some have questioned the purity of his action. England should pick a left-hander or two, for \"Cuddy\" does not like bowling round the wicket. But in truth nothing will stop him. It never has, just as nothing has stopped him dancing to his vast collection of salsa CDs. He played, of course, for Gloucestershire too, appearing for them first in 1984 and last in 1998, when he took 106 championship wickets at 17 apiece. His last four matches produced 34 wickets. He was one of the most successful of all overseas signings. But then he was told, by fax, that he would not be required last season. Gloucestershire, unhappy that he would not be available during the World Cup, and that he had been talking to other counties, even though out of contract, signed Australia's Ian Harvey instead. \"I was astonished that my association with Gloucestershire should be terminated as abruptly and brutally as that,\" said Walsh. The men at Bristol, one senses, will never be ambassadors.",

      "body": "<p>Karen Meador, John Howitt and Graham Cooper wouldn't claim to be revolutionaries. Karen runs a one-woman professional coaching agency from her Brighton home. John is an internet programmer who works in London during the week and returns to his family home in Nottingham at weekends. Graham was made redundant from a major IT company last September, and now makes a living working as a marketing specialist from his attic. </p> <p>But there are those who believe that they are in the vanguard of a revolution. They are, in the adrenaline-wired terminology of the heralds of change, \"free agents\". They know no fixed company loyalties; they work where and when they choose. They aren't employed in organised departments - instead, they come together for months, weeks or even mere days at a time to collaborate on specific projects, pooling their complementary skills before dispersing and moving on to the next challenge. And, unlike the standard-issue freelances, they may prefigure a transformation in the nature of companies and the way all of us relate to them. </p> <p>\"It's liberating, and humanising, in two ways,\" says Meador. \"My previous, employed work involved considerable travel with someone else determining the pace and scheduling. And this is more value-based: I can choose to do only work that fits with my interests and values. I can better target my skills and gifts, and I can say 'no' if I don't think the results of my work will be carried forward.\" </p> <p>There are millions like her: 25m in the US alone, according to Dan Pink, the hyperactive self-styled guru of the free-agent lifestyle and editor of the website FreeAgentNation.com, one of a proliferating number of sites springing up to oil the wheels of the new economy. (In the UK, their numbers remain mysterious: the office for national statistics doesn't recognise freelancing as a category, lumping all forms of casual work together.) For Pink, their historical soulmates are the condottieri of medieval Europe - \"soldiers fighting on behalf of any sovereign who could pay them and lead them into a worthy battle\": the original free lances. </p> <p>Despite the medieval parallels, though, free agency is only now gathering pace again, Pink argues. \"There has long been a social contract of work, in which the individual would give the organisation loyalty, and the organisation would give the individual security. That bargain started breaking down in the 1970s and disappeared in the 1990s. So now individuals are saying: 'I can be more secure with five clients than one boss'.\" </p> <p>Free agents are perhaps best defined by what they are not. His antithesis is the \"organisation man\", as characterised by the sociologist William Whyte in his 1956 book of the same name - loyally conformist corporate employees who gave their life to the company: \"A man,\" Whyte wrote, \"who is so completely involved in his work that he cannot distinguish between work and the rest of his life - and is happy that he cannot.\" But decades of downsizing and outsourcing have changed all that. And technology, champions of the free-agent concept argue, has rendered the efficiencies of the centralised megabusiness all but obsolete. </p> <p>Nobody's quite sure where the idea of the free agent came from. But the academics who are championing the cause trace it to a 1998 Harvard Business Review article, by Thomas Malone and Robert Laubacher, which coined the phrase \"the E-Lance economy\" and looked forward to \"a world in which business is not controlled through a stable chain of management in a large, permanent company [but] carried out by independent contractors connected through personal computers and electronic networks\". Pink, when he's not likening free agents to 15th century hired swordsmen, sees its origins in the US baseball players of the 1970s who refused to be traded between teams and pioneered the idea of the sportsman as independent star. </p> <p>In better-off pockets of the United States, free agency is fast becoming a religion: its bible is the glossy magazine Fast Company; its shrine is the 24-hour photocopy store, an on-tap business infrastructure where free agents can send faxes, and, in some stores, participate in videoconferences. But it is the internet which is the movement's lifeblood. On the web - at sites such as FreeAgent.com, Guru.com and Workexchange. com - they can pitch for work through \"reverse auctions\" where clients offer projects and contractors bid for them.

      "bodyText": "Karen Meador, John Howitt and Graham Cooper wouldn't claim to be revolutionaries. Karen runs a one-woman professional coaching agency from her Brighton home. John is an internet programmer who works in London during the week and returns to his family home in Nottingham at weekends. Graham was made redundant from a major IT company last September, and now makes a living working as a marketing specialist from his attic. But there are those who believe that they are in the vanguard of a revolution. They are, in the adrenaline-wired terminology of the heralds of change, \"free agents\". They know no fixed company loyalties; they work where and when they choose. They aren't employed in organised departments - instead, they come together for months, weeks or even mere days at a time to collaborate on specific projects, pooling their complementary skills before dispersing and moving on to the next challenge. And, unlike the standard-issue freelances, they may prefigure a transformation in the nature of companies and the way all of us relate to them. \"It's liberating, and humanising, in two ways,\" says Meador. \"My previous, employed work involved considerable travel with someone else determining the pace and scheduling. And this is more value-based: I can choose to do only work that fits with my interests and values. I can better target my skills and gifts, and I can say 'no' if I don't think the results of my work will be carried forward.\" There are millions like her: 25m in the US alone, according to Dan Pink, the hyperactive self-styled guru of the free-agent lifestyle and editor of the website FreeAgentNation.com, one of a proliferating number of sites springing up to oil the wheels of the new economy. (In the UK, their numbers remain mysterious: the office for national statistics doesn't recognise freelancing as a category, lumping all forms of casual work together.) For Pink, their historical soulmates are the condottieri of medieval Europe - \"soldiers fighting on behalf of any sovereign who could pay them and lead them into a worthy battle\": the original free lances. Despite the medieval parallels, though, free agency is only now gathering pace again, Pink argues. \"There has long been a social contract of work, in which the individual would give the organisation loyalty, and the organisation would give the individual security. That bargain started breaking down in the 1970s and disappeared in the 1990s. So now individuals are saying: 'I can be more secure with five clients than one boss'.\" Free agents are perhaps best defined by what they are not. His antithesis is the \"organisation man\", as characterised by the sociologist William Whyte in his 1956 book of the same name - loyally conformist corporate employees who gave their life to the company: \"A man,\" Whyte wrote, \"who is so completely involved in his work that he cannot distinguish between work and the rest of his life - and is happy that he cannot.\" But decades of downsizing and outsourcing have changed all that. And technology, champions of the free-agent concept argue, has rendered the efficiencies of the centralised megabusiness all but obsolete. Nobody's quite sure where the idea of the free agent came from. But the academics who are championing the cause trace it to a 1998 Harvard Business Review article, by Thomas Malone and Robert Laubacher, which coined the phrase \"the E-Lance economy\" and looked forward to \"a world in which business is not controlled through a stable chain of management in a large, permanent company [but] carried out by independent contractors connected through personal computers and electronic networks\". Pink, when he's not likening free agents to 15th century hired swordsmen, sees its origins in the US baseball players of the 1970s who refused to be traded between teams and pioneered the idea of the sportsman as independent star. In better-off pockets of the United States, free agency is fast becoming a religion: its bible is the glossy magazine Fast Company; its shrine is the 24-hour photocopy store, an on-tap business infrastructure where free agents can send faxes, and, in some stores, participate in videoconferences. But it is the internet which is the movement's lifeblood. On the web - at sites such as FreeAgent.com, Guru.com and Workexchange. com - they can pitch for work through \"reverse auctions\" where clients offer projects and contractors bid for them. On any given day at FreeAgent.com, find almost any kind of work with a hot internet start-up, or get hired as a session musician for a rock band. That's also the plan for Freelancers.net, a UK equivalent run out of a home office in Berkshire by Dan Winchester and Andy Stowell. \"People are beginning to use us as a way to source partners for jobs,\" says Winchester. \"Say I'm a designer and my clients want their website e-commerce enabled.

Freeserve has grown to be the largest internet service provider with about one third of the 7.8m estimated internet users in Britain. Mr Backhouse said it was \"perfectly realistic\" that Freeserve could come to dominate 50% of the British internet users market, but refused to give a time frame for this target. The company is transforming itself from an ISP to a web portal similar to Yahoo! It is driving this strategy by seeking content deals and acquisitions. This week it announced it had collaborated with Bar clays, Britain's second biggest bank, to offer financial services online to small business. Freeserve last week reported a loss of \u00a32.3m in the quarter ending February 5, while advertising revenue increased and subscriptions grew 50%. It is not expected to turn a profit until 2002. Total revenue in the quarter was \u00a35.1m, with 55% of that coming from e-commerce and advertising. It signed 126 advertisers in that period. The company has also counted on increased revenue from telephone tariffs but fierce competition has caused Freeserve to give up its share of those revenues from telephone calls by offering a flat monthly internet access fee which starts next month. This means it is faced with the battle of finding other ways of substituting that revenue which may come from the boom in online retailing in the next few years. Fletchers Research predicts that British online retailing business will grow from \u20ac350m in 1999 to \u20ac5.9bn in 2004.",

Equally surprising is that actor Simon Robson's contribution, The Ghost Train Tattoo, turns out to be a poetic study of middle-class family life of the kind Robert Bolt might have written in the 50s. Even if technically Robson has a lot to learn, his play has its own deeply felt truth. </p> <p>He starts from the Tolstoyan assumption that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own unique way. In this case, we are in the comfortable Wiltshire home of an ex-naval officer, George, who over the years manages to destroy two marriages and the lives of his three children. Intending to do good, George causes irreparable harm by treating his offspring as if they were mutinous ratings who needed a touch of the lash; as a result, they are driven variously into flight, suicide and a loveless despair. </p> <p>You could easily pinpoint Robson's faults. His structure is clumsy. He shifts the spotlight uneasily from one child to another. He is also woefully hazy on social detail: I longed to know how George was able to support two wives and a large family on a naval pension. But Robson's virtue is that he writes with burning indignation about the unthinking destructiveness of fathers: in one of the best scenes, George openly accuses his teenage son, Freddy, of having an affair with his piano-teacher, thereby killing both the boy's musical instinct and the teacher's career. George's first wife, ironically, works for the Swindon Samaritans; but Robson's point is that it is often the do-gooding middle classes who are the most dysfunctional and that we live still with the remnants of a ruined patriarchy where fathers are credited with a quasi-Biblical authority. </p> <p>Flawed though the play is, it makes you flinch with recognition. Robson also has the gift of leaving scenes poetically suspended just before they reach the point of crisis: a reflection, I suspect, of his actor's instinct. Some parts are better written than others but, in Braham Murray and Sarah Frankcom's suitably mood-indigo production, Terence Wilton lends George exactly the right air of apologetic tyranny. There is incisive support from Joseph Murray as the introspective Freddy, Gabrielle Drake as his interventionist stepmother and Margo Gunn as the seductive piano teacher, whose resonant cry of \"Fuck family!\" I suspect Robson would endorse. \u0095 In rep with Fiona Padfield's Snapshots until April 15.

      "bodyText": "Audiences like new plays. So it's heartening to find the Royal Exchange presenting a pair of premieres in rep on its main stage rather than shunting them into the studio. Equally surprising is that actor Simon Robson's contribution, The Ghost Train Tattoo, turns out to be a poetic study of middle-class family life of the kind Robert Bolt might have written in the 50s. Even if technically Robson has a lot to learn, his play has its own deeply felt truth. He starts from the Tolstoyan assumption that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own unique way. In this case, we are in the comfortable Wiltshire home of an ex-naval officer, George, who over the years manages to destroy two marriages and the lives of his three children. Intending to do good, George causes irreparable harm by treating his offspring as if they were mutinous ratings who needed a touch of the lash; as a result, they are driven variously into flight, suicide and a loveless despair. You could easily pinpoint Robson's faults. His structure is clumsy. He shifts the spotlight uneasily from one child to another. He is also woefully hazy on social detail: I longed to know how George was able to support two wives and a large family on a naval pension. But Robson's virtue is that he writes with burning indignation about the unthinking destructiveness of fathers: in one of the best scenes, George openly accuses his teenage son, Freddy, of having an affair with his piano-teacher, thereby killing both the boy's musical instinct and the teacher's career. George's first wife, ironically, works for the Swindon Samaritans; but Robson's point is that it is often the do-gooding middle classes who are the most dysfunctional and that we live still with the remnants of a ruined patriarchy where fathers are credited with a quasi-Biblical authority. Flawed though the play is, it makes you flinch with recognition. Robson also has the gift of leaving scenes poetically suspended just before they reach the point of crisis: a reflection, I suspect, of his actor's instinct. Some parts are better written than others but, in Braham Murray and Sarah Frankcom's suitably mood-indigo production, Terence Wilton lends George exactly the right air of apologetic tyranny. There is incisive support from Joseph Murray as the introspective Freddy, Gabrielle Drake as his interventionist stepmother and Margo Gunn as the seductive piano teacher, whose resonant cry of \"Fuck family!\" I suspect Robson would endorse. \u0095 In rep with Fiona Padfield's Snapshots until April 15.

      "bodyText": "Australia beat New Zealand by six wickets in Wellington yesterday to secure the series 2-0 with one to play and take their winning Test sequence to nine, an Australian record and only two short of West Indies' run between 1983 and 1985. Set 174 to win, Australia reached their target in fading light after tea. Their victory took them past the eight in consecutive Tests against England that Warwick Armstrong's 1920-21 team recorded. If they win the third Test in Hamilton starting on Friday their chance to equal the world record will come against West Indies in Brisbane later this year. Australia were in cool control yesterday. New Zealand, starting with a lead of 68, were looking to the first-innings centurion Chris Cairns and Stephen Fleming to extend their sixth-wicket partnership of 105. But Cairns added only eight and Fleming seven. Shane Warne, with three second-innings wickets, moved his total on to 363, eighth highest in the world, as Courtney Walsh was straining in the Caribbean to go from second to first past Kapil Dev. The New Zealand spinner Daniel Vettori will undergo a bone scan today to determine whether he is fit for Friday. Scoreboard New Zealand: First innings 298 (Cairns 109, Astle 61; Warne 4-68). Australia: First innings 419 (S Waugh 151, Slater 143, Martyn 78).

Fortunately for Arsenal fans everywhere, Petit quickly returns the talk to how much he enjoys getting smashed with the lads, going out on the pull... and his lack of a dress designer. \"There are not many dress designers who manage to make me dream,\" he dolefully admits. \"I rather take a pull-over here, a shirt there and some trousers elsewhere. I don't have a regular dress designer.\" The man clearly needs help. So if you're a dress designer, pay a visit to the London branch of his boutique, Jitrois in Sloane Square. That's the one whose walls are covered with fur \"creating a muffled and original atmosphere.\" Arsenal's Big Cup place could depend on it. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL According to Spursweb.com, Spurs have agreed an \u00a38m deal with Dynamo Kyiv for their prolific striker Sergiy Rebrov. Leeds are prepared to match Everton's \u00a33m valuation of Don Hutchison and are preparing a summer bid to take the Scotland international to Elland Road. Liverpool look set to pay \u00a31.5m to secure the services of teenage Millwall striker Cherno Samba. The 15-year-old was a guest of the club at Anfield on Saturday. Derby manager Jim Smith is hoping to add Motherwell's Finnish international Simo Valakari to his midfield this summer. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Seven current and former Leicester players and staff have been found guilty of misconduct by the FA. Players Andy Impey, Tony Cottee, Arnar Gunnlaugsson, Scott Taylor and Graham Fenton, plus Academy director David Nish and chief scout Jim Melrose, were found to have handled tickets for last year's Worthington Cup final \"irresponsibly\". The guilty parties were fined and banned from receiving tickets for home internationals, cup finals or cup semi-finals. NTL, through its subsidiary company Premium TV Limited, has taken a 5.585% stake in Middlesbrough for an undisclosed fee. The investment will make Premium the exclusive worldwide agent for certain media and commercial rights, excluding those negotiated by the FA Premier League, for five years. Boro becomes the third Premiership club to strike a deal with the cable giants. Alex Ferguson has been named the greatest manager of all time after a poll conducted among the country's coaches by magazine FourFourTwo.

Norwegian international striker John Carew will join Valencia in the summer, putting paid to potential bids from Arsenal, Spurs and Leeds. \"Several clubs have been in the picture, but Valencia have always been my first choice,\" said Rosenborg's leading scorer. \"I've seen them on television and I was impressed. They're among the best in Spain, and I have a good chance of a fixed team place.\" Co Adriaanse has been named as the new coach of Ajax Amsterdam. The former Willem II coach will replace Jan Wouters. Both Harry Kewell and Lucas Radebe will miss upcoming friendly matches with their respective national sides. The Leeds players have not been selected in the Australian and South African squads named today, to allow them to concentrate on Leeds' Uefa Cup tie with Galatasaray. Greek international midfielder Theo Zagorakis will return home to AEK Athens this summer after a two-year spell at Leicester City. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Channel 4: Football Italia (2am) A load of European no-hopers (and Lazio) hoof the ball around.

The incident is the second such loss in the last month. Just days ago - on March 4 - it was revealed that an MI5 laptop computer containing classified information on Northern Ireland had been stolen from Paddington underground station. The Foreign Office confirmed that the MI6 laptop was lost on March 3, the loss reported to the Metropolitan police, and, following a police investigation, was recovered on March 16. \"We were assured by the police that the laptop was not compromised,\" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said last night. The department, which has responsibility for MI6, is preparing a report. A mini-cab firm boss today revealed another string to the agencies intelligence-gathering activities when he said he was contacted by MI6 agents about the laptop. MI6 used an anonymous newspaper advert to try and track down the laptop claiming an academic had lost \"vital research notes\" stored on the machine. \"It was all a bit odd,\" said Frank Henry who runs a mini-cab firm near the tapas bar. \"I got a visit from two smartly dressed men, I think they were wearing suits, at the beginning of March. They said they had lost a briefcase with something important in it which they thought they might have left in a taxi, and asked if we had found anything. \"They had been the worse for wear that night. One of the men said they couldn't remember what cab firm they had called because they were in such a state.\" Tom King, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee which will review the Foreign Office report, said they would be asking some \"tough questions\" about security at both agencies. \"The fact that people working in the agencies are taking laptops around in public which may have intelligence information on it, even if it is encrypted, is a very serious matter. \"I don't think sufficient thought has been given to what the impact of this new technology is,\" he added.",

Infectious diseases - HIV, say, or tuberculosis - will rule you out, because you may endanger staff and students. If you die of a cancer that has spread throughout your body, you will not display normal anatomical structures, and consequently won't be much use for general teaching.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>David Thrower has photos, as any parent does, of his son Oliver as a toddler, a bright little fellow. Then he produces a photo of Oliver at 15 months and something is wrong: the child's eyes are blank. That was when David and his partner first noticed their boy's decline, one that coincided with a measles vaccination. Then at the age of four Oliver had the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab, after which all his skills, says Thrower, \"dissolved\". He screamed, became destructive, and attacked his parents and other children. </p> <p>Now aged 12, he has no speech at all, can't feed or dress himself, and is hyperactive. Oliver had become autistic, one of a growing number of children diagnosed with this condition. But Thrower did not invite me to his house in Warrington to talk about immunisation. Although he thinks vaccinations may be one cause of autism, he suspects there are other environmental and genetic factors that could play a part - and he wants to know what they are. It may be too late for Oliver, but he hopes he can make a difference for other children. </p> <p>\"The point is to find out the truth, to get to the heart of it. There's a terrible reluctance to look into the prevalence and causes of autism, but science isn't advanced by closed minds,\" he says. </p> <p>Three years ago, Thrower gave up his job as a transport planner to look after Oliver and be a \"house husband\" while his partner continued to work full time. Aged 49, he is remarkably fit and energetic for someone whose son's hyperactivity ensures that he rarely gets an uninterrupted night's sleep. He spends all his spare time researching the causes of autism and its prevalence after discovering, to his amazement, that there was almost no official data. </p> <p>\"Don't make it a sob story,\" he says genially: he doesn't want this to be a sentimental tale of a broken-hearted man. Looking at the yards of files in his office, you marvel that he managed to research and write the meticulous 90-page document on the possible causes, treatment and rates of autism that he presented to the health select committee of the House of Commons last summer. </p> <p>Since the outset of his research, Thrower has been writing to ministers and officials at the Department of Health. At first they responded at length. \"All propaganda and sales talk,\" says Thrower. But as his questions became more probing, the replies became more evasive, and now he doesn't get replies at all. </p> <p>Undeterred, he ploughed on, and earlier this month produced his latest findings, which expose dramatic rises in autism and the shambolic state of data collection in the UK. As psychiatrist Dr Lorna Wing, an expert on autism, made clear in a recent report for the National Autistic Society: \"There is no central recording by the UK government and very few epidemiological studies on which to make informed predictions. The available studies into this population are infrequent, expensive and problematic.\" </p> <p>Thrower, alone in his study, in his own time and at his own expense, has made a start.

      "bodyText": "David Thrower has photos, as any parent does, of his son Oliver as a toddler, a bright little fellow. Then he produces a photo of Oliver at 15 months and something is wrong: the child's eyes are blank. That was when David and his partner first noticed their boy's decline, one that coincided with a measles vaccination. Then at the age of four Oliver had the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab, after which all his skills, says Thrower, \"dissolved\". He screamed, became destructive, and attacked his parents and other children. Now aged 12, he has no speech at all, can't feed or dress himself, and is hyperactive. Oliver had become autistic, one of a growing number of children diagnosed with this condition. But Thrower did not invite me to his house in Warrington to talk about immunisation. Although he thinks vaccinations may be one cause of autism, he suspects there are other environmental and genetic factors that could play a part - and he wants to know what they are. It may be too late for Oliver, but he hopes he can make a difference for other children. \"The point is to find out the truth, to get to the heart of it. There's a terrible reluctance to look into the prevalence and causes of autism, but science isn't advanced by closed minds,\" he says. Three years ago, Thrower gave up his job as a transport planner to look after Oliver and be a \"house husband\" while his partner continued to work full time. Aged 49, he is remarkably fit and energetic for someone whose son's hyperactivity ensures that he rarely gets an uninterrupted night's sleep. He spends all his spare time researching the causes of autism and its prevalence after discovering, to his amazement, that there was almost no official data. \"Don't make it a sob story,\" he says genially: he doesn't want this to be a sentimental tale of a broken-hearted man. Looking at the yards of files in his office, you marvel that he managed to research and write the meticulous 90-page document on the possible causes, treatment and rates of autism that he presented to the health select committee of the House of Commons last summer. Since the outset of his research, Thrower has been writing to ministers and officials at the Department of Health. At first they responded at length. \"All propaganda and sales talk,\" says Thrower. But as his questions became more probing, the replies became more evasive, and now he doesn't get replies at all. Undeterred, he ploughed on, and earlier this month produced his latest findings, which expose dramatic rises in autism and the shambolic state of data collection in the UK. As psychiatrist Dr Lorna Wing, an expert on autism, made clear in a recent report for the National Autistic Society: \"There is no central recording by the UK government and very few epidemiological studies on which to make informed predictions. The available studies into this population are infrequent, expensive and problematic.\" Thrower, alone in his study, in his own time and at his own expense, has made a start. Last year, he wrote to 161 organisations - every health authority in this country and a number of other bodies - asking them whether they collected data on rates for autism spectrum disorders (ASD - the technical term for wide-ranging autistic diagnosis) and what the data showed. Just over half replied. Thrower doesn't pretend that his monitoring was perfect. It was a trawl providing \"interesting\" snapshots. \"Interesting\" is his word: many people would say alarming.

In East Surrey, for example, where an audit was taken of all three-year-olds in a health trust district, autism amongst three year old boys was running at 1 in 69. Several authorities were uncertain as to whether the climb in reported cases of ASD was due to better diagnosis or greater prevalence, but a significant number believed it to be the latter. Thrower's analysis of statistics from Bromley Autistic Trust shows that in the 80s they had a 120% rise, with latest figures - for the early 90s - showing that rise continuing. In the Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS trust there was an average annual increase of 37% of children under five during 1991-6. In Shropshire, the health authority figures show that while numbers are small they are rising, from 1-2 new cases per year in 1991 to 4-5 in 1999. In North Staffordshire, the health trust does has not have exact data but \"has noted a bulge of younger cases in a local school\", and in South Staffordshire the \"special school for autistic children has had to expand provision and is still bursting at the seams\". Of the health authorities that have made the effort to collate information on autism rates, there is a huge variation in the effort made: West Surrey concluded that autism was very rare on the basis of a week-long survey in 1998; while Ealing Hammersmith and Hounslow uses data from hospital admissions.

Probably the most common sort of injection is the IV, which often involves inserting a cannula (a short length of plastic tubing) into the vein to give drugs or fluids. Dr Bruno Simini, who carried out the Italian trial, says that patients should be anaesthetised before a cannula is inserted. He's right, but it doesn't always happen. You can apply anaesthetic cream which numbs the skin, but it takes about 20 to 30 minutes to work, and in an emergency there may not be time. It's usually reserved for children, although it can be used just as well on adults. The effect is never complete, and even if you prevent actual pain, the patient still feels the \"pushing\" sensation, which many children will interpret as pain. </p> <p>The alternative is to inject a tiny blob of local anaesthetic just under the skin. Many doctors still argue that having a local injection is just as painful as the other injection, so why bother? But having had IV cannulae myself both with and without local, I can confirm that a tiny injection of local does not hurt anywhere near as much as having a 2mm diameter needle shoved into a vein. </p> <p>The problem is that even a tiny amount of fluid under the skin can make its successful puncture afterwards more difficult. If you have to make two attempts instead of one, it rather defeats the object of the exercise. I always use local for anything other than the very smallest cannula, but some doctors are not comfortable with it. </p> <p>Then there are IM injections.

      "body": "<p><strong> Is this folic folly?</strong><br> <strong> Q: </strong>A visiting friend had an early morning ritual of gobbling a handful of vitamins, minerals and supplements while I had toast and cornflakes. The one she set most store by was folic acid, to prevent heart disease. I took it in the early stages of pregnancy, then stopped. Should I take it too? </p> <p> <strong> A:</strong> Cornflakes with milk, toast and some fresh fruit or orange juice is a nutritionally sound way to start the day. Folic acid (folate) lowers blood levels of a chemical called homocysteine, which we get from our normal diet. Very high homocysteine levels - brought about by a rare genetic disorder - are linked to increased risk of heart disease, strokes and possibly dementia, so lowering homocysteine levels ought to reduce those risks. However, proof that high levels actually cause these ailments is still awaited - the presence of homocysteine may reflect other risk factors, such as poor diet and smoking. There's no harm in eating lots of green veg which are rich in the substance anyway. </p> <p><strong> Dealing with Parkinson's</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> My elderly father has been told he has early Parkinson's disease. He has slowed down considerably, his hands shake and he has lost a lot of his zest for life. The pills his GP has given him, carbidopa, don't seem to be making much impact. Is there anything else we can do? </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Parkinson's is common in older people. Brain nerve cells that control movement and contain the chemical messenger dopamine deteriorate. The pills your father is taking contain a dopamine-like drug called levodopa, which can be very helpful. His lack of improvement could be because the diagnosis is wrong (he could be depressed and have a harmless tremor), the dose might need adjusting or he may need a different drug. New drugs that boost dopamine levels in the brain, such as ropinirole (ReQuip), appear to work as well as levodopa but with fewer side effects. The Parkinson's Disease Society (tel: 020 7931 8080) could recommend a neurologist if your father wants to be referred to a specialist. </p> <p><strong> Sperm counting</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> My partner wants us to try for a baby now. I'd rather wait, as I'm only 21. He's 25 and reckons that sperm counts are falling all the time because of environmental poisoning, so we shouldn't hang around. Will four to five more years make any difference? </p> <p><strong> A: </strong> No. Tell him that men today produce just as many sperm as their grandfathers did, according to a US study completed in 1997 and comparing samples from a 1951 study. If he is worried about his own sperm count, he can get a semen sample analysed at the local hospital lab. At 25, if he hasn't had chemotherapy or serious illness or surgery that may affect his fertility, he shouldn't worry unduly. </p> <p><strong> Dosage disorders</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I contracted a severe urinary tract infection last July, requiring five days in hospital. Since then, I have had recurring infections. Last October a urologist prescribed long-term low-dose antibiotics (Trimethoprim), but now I have three weeks or so clear, then the pain returns, followed by nausea and dizziness. I am then prescribed another antibiotic then told to resume the low dose. Tests and scans have detected no under lying problem. I am 53 and had a hysterectomy at 37. </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Constant antibiotics are clearly not a satisfactory long-term solution. It may be that your vagina has become dry, sore and susceptible to infections since you went through the menopause. HRT in the form of oestrogen pessaries or vaginal creams often helps. You could try HRT as oral tablets or patches. If you can't take HRT, antiseptic pessaries such as Aci-Jel are worth a try. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor.

From Attlee to Thatcher, that was how things were seen to be. But the obvious clich\u00e9 contained a latent paradox, which has burst unanswerably to the surface in the time of William Hague.

On the other hand, apparently, their national identity is so fragile that it faces imminent destruction at the hands of foreigners and Scotsmen, abetted by Tony Blair.</p> <p>Today, Mr Blair knifes this charge, in a speech that has been prepared for weeks and leaked for days. Several colleagues are billed to follow, in an important pre-election campaign that's supposed to reclaim Britishness for Labour. It's another epic moment in Labour's long march through the centre ground of politics. What's most striking about it, however, is that the message has become irrefutable. The campaign is all but redundant. Mr Hague may have lost his last issue.</p> <p>The Hague view of Britishness is dominated by enemies and nostalgia. He gave a speech about it a year ago, which was incorrigibly narrow and defensive, glorying above all in the need to resist every European advance. The sacred exhibit, national identity, could never be moved. Labour's entire constitutional programme was cracking the Wedgwood. The third way was not the British way. Devolution and Lords reform were violating the very heart of Britain. The country itself, set in the silver sea, could not be relied on to survive.</p> <p>Mr Hague is not alone. Vapourings about the future of Britishness have produced speeches and books on a prodigious scale in the past few years. What has mostly characterised those from the right is not inquiry but anxiety. With the absorption of Indians and the separation of Scots, is Britain not already dead? Though Hague has moved on from the ideal of ethnic homogeneity, his version of Britishness is marked with the vulgar untruth espoused by Enoch Powell and Margaret Thatcher: that \"Britain\" lives only by the unchanging nature of its political arrangements.</p> <p>When Mr Blair came to power, he didn't have a worked-out idea about \"Britain\". It's been a persistent argument against his constitutional programme that there was, in fact, no programme, merely a set of ill-connected initiatives answering different political demands. But what he has done so far is the opposite of a threat to Britain.</p> <p>Take devolution. Yes, the early days of the Scottish and Welsh assemblies have been difficult. They challenge the pattern of politics we have come to know as British. Sometimes they've been quite a mess. The entire political formation of all concerned, the men in Downing Street as much as those outside, has received a nasty assault which few of them were ready for. The psychology as well as the politics of centralism takes a lot of shifting.</p> <p>But to talk about this as the end of Britain is the hyperbolic nonsense of desperate minds. It's merely a new, confederal kind of Britain, stumbling towards a model that arises by popular regional demand, and provides the possibility of Britain reconciling the power of global economic forces with the desire to preserve identity. Devolved institutions, when they've had time to bed down and be understood as normal, will say that Britain flourishes as a land of multiple identities. While Hagueism stands for an inward exclusiveness, Blairism feels its way to the world of porous truths.</p> <p>It has more to do, if Britain is not to wither. Britain can't survive if England remains the centralised and dominant sub-state. Whether English devolution is driven through via local government or regional government will be a serious debate. But the reactionaries who would destroy Britain had better prepare for a painful discussion. Likewise, that other Hagueite icon, the House of Lords. Whatever may or may not happen to the membership of the second chamber, the notion that \"Britain\" can exist only if the ranks and titles of lordship are sustained for another century would be the grossest trivialising of national identity.</p> <p>In a Downing Street lecture not long ago, the historian Linda Colley proposed an end to these debates about identity. They had got us nowhere, she said. Instead, she advised her audience of the great and good to address what they could do something about: citizenship. Let people stop worrying about such neuralgic questions as losing British identity or buying into European identity. All these identities could co-exist: would, indeed, be largely dependent on the image of themselves that individual citizens preferred to have. What politicians could affect was how their citizenship was made real.</p> <p>Professor Colley urged that we should know, whichever patch of the islands we came from, what defines us as a citizen and what our rights are. She wasn't in favour of a republic, but suggested a monarchy that swore a solemn oath of service to the people - rather than being either swathed in anachronistic pomp or reduced to riding bicycles. As well as diffusion of power from the centre, a citizen's Britain would do more to engage its ethnic minorities as well and truly British - as being, indeed, the salient proof that, unlike Englishness, Welshness or Scottishness, Britishness is a concept \"with no necessary ethnic or cultural overtones\".</p> <p>Finally, she suggested the British should know more history. If they did so, they would discover not only that Britain had much to be proud of that did not entail the brutalities of imperialism, but that it co-existed with social and political change. When India achieved independence there were many Tories who believed that Britain, having begun to surrender its empire, had undermined its own raison d' \u00eatre. It should now be clear that they misread history in the same way the terrified anti-reformers of modern Conservatism, invoking their static view of what nation means, have elicited from Mr Blair the speech he is making today.</p> <p>I hope he, in his turn, is not defensive. He has plenty to do to make the political mechanics of the new devolved and European Britain work better. But the reinventions he has begun have reversed the roles history once assigned to these two parties. Now it is Conservatism for dreams, Labour for reality.</p>",

Let people stop worrying about such neuralgic questions as losing British identity or buying into European identity. All these identities could co-exist: would, indeed, be largely dependent on the image of themselves that individual citizens preferred to have. What politicians could affect was how their citizenship was made real. Professor Colley urged that we should know, whichever patch of the islands we came from, what defines us as a citizen and what our rights are. She wasn't in favour of a republic, but suggested a monarchy that swore a solemn oath of service to the people - rather than being either swathed in anachronistic pomp or reduced to riding bicycles. As well as diffusion of power from the centre, a citizen's Britain would do more to engage its ethnic minorities as well and truly British - as being, indeed, the salient proof that, unlike Englishness, Welshness or Scottishness, Britishness is a concept \"with no necessary ethnic or cultural overtones\". Finally, she suggested the British should know more history. If they did so, they would discover not only that Britain had much to be proud of that did not entail the brutalities of imperialism, but that it co-existed with social and political change. When India achieved independence there were many Tories who believed that Britain, having begun to surrender its empire, had undermined its own raison d' \u00eatre. It should now be clear that they misread history in the same way the terrified anti-reformers of modern Conservatism, invoking their static view of what nation means, have elicited from Mr Blair the speech he is making today. I hope he, in his turn, is not defensive. He has plenty to do to make the political mechanics of the new devolved and European Britain work better. But the reinventions he has begun have reversed the roles history once assigned to these two parties. Now it is Conservatism for dreams, Labour for reality.",

      "trailText": "<p>American Beauty is a stylish and intelligent satire, but it was the power of love that won it five major Academy Awards, writes Guardian film critic  Peter Bradshaw</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sam Mendes's American Beauty had a resounding triumph at Sunday night's Academy Awards, winning Oscars for best picture, actor, director, original screenplay and cinematography. The awards demonstrate Hollywood's novel eagerness to be beguiled by a smart, literate script with classy performances from intelligent grown-ups. </p> <p>The success is encouraging, in that it siphons attention away from sentimental shlockers like The Green Mile, with its questionable take on race, and The Cider House Rules, with its bizarre pseudo-issues. But it is depressing that brilliant nominees vanished utterly from the radar: there was nothing for Michael Mann's stunning The Insider, Spike Jonze's direction of Being John Malkovich or Tom Cruise's acting in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, movies that are genuinely challenging and experimental in form and tone. </p> <p>The Oscars showered on Mendes's stylish and exhilarating film are none the less a heartening riposte to dumbing-down and juvenilisation in commercial American cinema. But they also show that in this film Hollywood feels it has an almost perfect combination. There are modish art-house qualities in moderation, a pinch of indie-ness flattering for the Academy's amour propre, and a daring and seductive style that can plausibly showcase both middle-aged sexuality in menopausal revolt and the creamy yearnings of young love. (At some unconscious level, the Academy will have had a shrewd appreciation that candid topless scenes for Thora Birch and Mena Suvari have done box office no harm.) </p> <p>American Beauty also maintains the astringency of satire. But although its felicitous title is shaded with irony, it conveys an essentially comforting endorsement of the mother country and its warm-hearted family values. American Beauty pulled off the clever trick of soothing and reassuring the Academy's conservative sensibilities - and perhaps members even heard a ghost of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life in Spacey's this-is-where-I-live voiceover. </p> <p>It is another blow on behalf of elder statesman Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks SKG behemoth. Who could have guessed we would hear the F-word and the C-word in a DreamWorks picture? His choice of Sam Mendes now looks inspired, and the meeting he engineered between the young British stage director and the veteran American cinematographer Conrad L Hall looks set to pass into Hollywood legend. Mendes's award for direction is the most thoroughly and conspicuously deserved of the list. </p> <p>Perhaps what put American Beauty ahead of The Insider, The Sixth Sense, The Cider House Rules and The Green Mile is that, for all the dark suburban weirdness, this was the film with the clearest, strongest account of conventional romantic love. This is what appeals most to the Academy's palate and the cinemagoing public: not botched abortions, ghosts, nicotine enhancement, or criminals bursting into flames in the electric chair. The Insider, for example, was notable in that there is no sex interest or sex dilemma of any sort. Al Pacino is a middle-aged guy happily married with grown-up children to an intelligent non-babe his own age, and Russell Crowe plays an intellectual and a scientist whose agonies are not of the heart. Perhaps the Academy just likes that most classical narrative template of all: the story of love. </p> <p>The male actor winners give pleasingly intelligent turns: nobody deserves promotion to the A-list more than Kevin Spacey, and his delivery of the line in American Beauty about missing the James Bond theme night on TV deserves some sort of award all on its own. (Again, for technical expertise and depth, my vote would go to Russell Crowe, but no one could quarrel with Spacey that much.) But Michael Caine's supporting actor award for The Cider House Rules is a bit baffling. This is an actor with weight and presence, an actor with great technique, often overlooked on account of typecasting.

      "bodyText": "Sam Mendes's American Beauty had a resounding triumph at Sunday night's Academy Awards, winning Oscars for best picture, actor, director, original screenplay and cinematography. The awards demonstrate Hollywood's novel eagerness to be beguiled by a smart, literate script with classy performances from intelligent grown-ups. The success is encouraging, in that it siphons attention away from sentimental shlockers like The Green Mile, with its questionable take on race, and The Cider House Rules, with its bizarre pseudo-issues. But it is depressing that brilliant nominees vanished utterly from the radar: there was nothing for Michael Mann's stunning The Insider, Spike Jonze's direction of Being John Malkovich or Tom Cruise's acting in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, movies that are genuinely challenging and experimental in form and tone. The Oscars showered on Mendes's stylish and exhilarating film are none the less a heartening riposte to dumbing-down and juvenilisation in commercial American cinema. But they also show that in this film Hollywood feels it has an almost perfect combination. There are modish art-house qualities in moderation, a pinch of indie-ness flattering for the Academy's amour propre, and a daring and seductive style that can plausibly showcase both middle-aged sexuality in menopausal revolt and the creamy yearnings of young love. (At some unconscious level, the Academy will have had a shrewd appreciation that candid topless scenes for Thora Birch and Mena Suvari have done box office no harm.) American Beauty also maintains the astringency of satire. But although its felicitous title is shaded with irony, it conveys an essentially comforting endorsement of the mother country and its warm-hearted family values. American Beauty pulled off the clever trick of soothing and reassuring the Academy's conservative sensibilities - and perhaps members even heard a ghost of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life in Spacey's this-is-where-I-live voiceover. It is another blow on behalf of elder statesman Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks SKG behemoth. Who could have guessed we would hear the F-word and the C-word in a DreamWorks picture? His choice of Sam Mendes now looks inspired, and the meeting he engineered between the young British stage director and the veteran American cinematographer Conrad L Hall looks set to pass into Hollywood legend. Mendes's award for direction is the most thoroughly and conspicuously deserved of the list. Perhaps what put American Beauty ahead of The Insider, The Sixth Sense, The Cider House Rules and The Green Mile is that, for all the dark suburban weirdness, this was the film with the clearest, strongest account of conventional romantic love. This is what appeals most to the Academy's palate and the cinemagoing public: not botched abortions, ghosts, nicotine enhancement, or criminals bursting into flames in the electric chair. The Insider, for example, was notable in that there is no sex interest or sex dilemma of any sort. Al Pacino is a middle-aged guy happily married with grown-up children to an intelligent non-babe his own age, and Russell Crowe plays an intellectual and a scientist whose agonies are not of the heart. Perhaps the Academy just likes that most classical narrative template of all: the story of love. The male actor winners give pleasingly intelligent turns: nobody deserves promotion to the A-list more than Kevin Spacey, and his delivery of the line in American Beauty about missing the James Bond theme night on TV deserves some sort of award all on its own. (Again, for technical expertise and depth, my vote would go to Russell Crowe, but no one could quarrel with Spacey that much.) But Michael Caine's supporting actor award for The Cider House Rules is a bit baffling. This is an actor with weight and presence, an actor with great technique, often overlooked on account of typecasting. His Dr Larch has twinkling charm, but this is not an outstanding performance from Caine, who was much better in Hannah and Her Sisters and in Educating Rita. Caine's award shows the striking new readiness of the industry and the American public to accept Brits in American roles with American accents, but his accent is outrageously bad, especially considering that Crowe showed how to do a much more convincing one, and transform himself physically into the bargain. One of the big disappointments of the evening was how lacklustre the female acting awards were.

      "body": "<p>Most fast bowlers are sports cars, Ferraris or Aston Martins, exciting but expensive. Courtney Walsh is a Volvo. A number of fast bowlers have been more brilliant, and a few of them are playing today - Donald, Wasim, McGrath, Ambrose. But no fast bowler, past or present, comes close to Walsh for durability.</p> <p>He started slowly, and finished slowly, but he got there in the end, with the help of a man called Olonga. He began, 16 years ago, as the West Indies' uphill, into-the-wind, only-two-slips bowler (somebody had to do it) and was half way through his career before he was even given the new ball. His autobiography, which appeared last year, should have been ghosted by Aesop. Walsh may be the tallest, thinnest tortoise in history.</p> <p>Only three men have ever reached 400 wickets in Tests. The first, Richard Hadlee of New Zealand, was a great fast-medium bowler and a useful lower-order hitter. The second, Kapil Dev of India, was a great allrounder, and a very good medium-fast bowler. The third, Walsh, is a comically incompetent batsman, as he reminded us yesterday, by lasting three balls when all he had to do was stay in for a few minutes and see his captain to a hundred. How he goes in ahead of Reon King is one of life's mysteries. But great bowlers don't have to be able to bat. </p> <p>Walsh, unlike Hadlee and Dev, has been classified for nearly all his career as RF: right-arm fast. Just because he bowls within himself five balls an over, doesn't mean he isn't quick. It is fair to assume that no one in history has been so fast for so long. At 37 and a half, on a torpid pitch, he can still make Test batsmen jump. The only Englishman to take even 350 wickets is Ian Botham, with 373. When he reached the age Courtney is now, he was history: a portly shadow of his former self, sending down a few wily slow-medium pacers. </p> <p>The man with the wide rolling eyes has seen it all. He began in 1983-84, when West Indies still had a decade to go as kings of the world. He played under Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards, Richie Richardson. He succeeded Richardson himself, the first fast bowler ever to captain the West Indies. He lost the captaincy to Brian Lara, but only one of them surrendered any dignity in the process, and it wasn't Walsh. </p> <p>He is a fast bowler, not a saint. At Sabina Park in 1993-94, he subjected another fast man with a Jamaican heritage, Devon Malcolm, to a vicious barrage. When he did the same to Mike Atherton, that was fair enough, and Atherton relished the duel, whereas Malcolm could hardly see the bowler, let alone the ball. But that was out of character, and one beat-up in 16 years is a pretty good record. As Atherton confirmed in a generous tribute on Sunday, Walsh is as popular with other players as a leading fast bowler can be. </p> <p>His record is unlikely to stand for long. Shane Warne, seven years his junior, is into the 350s, and Wasim Akram, 33, is on 383. Walsh should become the first man to make it to 450, some time this summer in England, but 500 is surely beyond him. In this series, at last, West Indies have become a team with four fast bowlers again, not two. He will hand over as gracefully as Kapil Dev has, with champagne and good wishes. He has given us many indelible memories and two more came yesterday. One was the sight of Courtney's mum, proudly manning, or womanning, her home-made scoreboard, changing 434 to 435 and No 2 in the world to No 1. The other was Courtney himself, celebrating his first two wickets: the oldest seamer in town, running around in circles, like a small boy being an aeroplane. After 4197 overs, that says a lot. </p> <p><em>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com and Wisden Cricket Monthly.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Most fast bowlers are sports cars, Ferraris or Aston Martins, exciting but expensive. Courtney Walsh is a Volvo. A number of fast bowlers have been more brilliant, and a few of them are playing today - Donald, Wasim, McGrath, Ambrose. But no fast bowler, past or present, comes close to Walsh for durability. He started slowly, and finished slowly, but he got there in the end, with the help of a man called Olonga. He began, 16 years ago, as the West Indies' uphill, into-the-wind, only-two-slips bowler (somebody had to do it) and was half way through his career before he was even given the new ball. His autobiography, which appeared last year, should have been ghosted by Aesop. Walsh may be the tallest, thinnest tortoise in history. Only three men have ever reached 400 wickets in Tests. The first, Richard Hadlee of New Zealand, was a great fast-medium bowler and a useful lower-order hitter. The second, Kapil Dev of India, was a great allrounder, and a very good medium-fast bowler. The third, Walsh, is a comically incompetent batsman, as he reminded us yesterday, by lasting three balls when all he had to do was stay in for a few minutes and see his captain to a hundred. How he goes in ahead of Reon King is one of life's mysteries. But great bowlers don't have to be able to bat. Walsh, unlike Hadlee and Dev, has been classified for nearly all his career as RF: right-arm fast. Just because he bowls within himself five balls an over, doesn't mean he isn't quick. It is fair to assume that no one in history has been so fast for so long. At 37 and a half, on a torpid pitch, he can still make Test batsmen jump. The only Englishman to take even 350 wickets is Ian Botham, with 373. When he reached the age Courtney is now, he was history: a portly shadow of his former self, sending down a few wily slow-medium pacers. The man with the wide rolling eyes has seen it all. He began in 1983-84, when West Indies still had a decade to go as kings of the world. He played under Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards, Richie Richardson. He succeeded Richardson himself, the first fast bowler ever to captain the West Indies. He lost the captaincy to Brian Lara, but only one of them surrendered any dignity in the process, and it wasn't Walsh. He is a fast bowler, not a saint. At Sabina Park in 1993-94, he subjected another fast man with a Jamaican heritage, Devon Malcolm, to a vicious barrage. When he did the same to Mike Atherton, that was fair enough, and Atherton relished the duel, whereas Malcolm could hardly see the bowler, let alone the ball. But that was out of character, and one beat-up in 16 years is a pretty good record. As Atherton confirmed in a generous tribute on Sunday, Walsh is as popular with other players as a leading fast bowler can be. His record is unlikely to stand for long. Shane Warne, seven years his junior, is into the 350s, and Wasim Akram, 33, is on 383. Walsh should become the first man to make it to 450, some time this summer in England, but 500 is surely beyond him. In this series, at last, West Indies have become a team with four fast bowlers again, not two. He will hand over as gracefully as Kapil Dev has, with champagne and good wishes. He has given us many indelible memories and two more came yesterday. One was the sight of Courtney's mum, proudly manning, or womanning, her home-made scoreboard, changing 434 to 435 and No 2 in the world to No 1. The other was Courtney himself, celebrating his first two wickets: the oldest seamer in town, running around in circles, like a small boy being an aeroplane. After 4197 overs, that says a lot.

      "body": "<p><strong> Troy</strong><br>Ad\u00e8le Geras <br>David Fickling Books, \u00a314.99</p> <p>Ad\u00e8le Geras has told one of the founding stories of Western culture, a tale that has been related a thousand times and still comes up fresh. The story of the destruction of Troy at the hands of the Greeks. To her great credit she tells it straight, without the slightest visible straining for effect. Her perspective is interesting, too. This is a Troy seen from below, from the kitchens and the stables and (a wonderful notion) the Blood Room, where the wounded are tended by the young Xanthe. </p> <p>Geras's other triumph is the way she deals with the gods. They appear suddenly and naturally, to speak or intervene, and then vanish again, leaving us with the sense of a world governed by powers and riddled with jealousies only half understood by the suffering mortals. Every generation needs its version of this great story. This one, powerful, clear, and compassionate, is the best I've read for a long time. </p> <p><strong> A Voyage of Discovery, Volume 1: From the Land of the Amazons to the Indigo Isles</strong><br>Fran\u00e7ois Place, translated by Aubrey Lawrence <br>Pavilion, \u00a312.99</p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Place is an extraordinary artist, not quite like anyone else I can think of. A Voyage of Discovery is a series of prodigiously inventive landscapes in words and exquisite pictures. The concept is rather like that of Umberto Eco's Invisible Cities: different places, in this case entire fantastical countries, are described and drawn in as if by curious observers from elsewhere.</p> <p>The invention is astonishing: in Ba\u00eflaba\u00efkal, for example, they build parks among the reed-beds where they rear giant snakes. In spring, the snakes are taken to volcanoes of hot mud, where male midwives help them shed their skins; and the skins are then stretched over a framework of sticks to make canoes.

      "bodyText": "Troy Ad\u00e8le Geras David Fickling Books, \u00a314.99 Ad\u00e8le Geras has told one of the founding stories of Western culture, a tale that has been related a thousand times and still comes up fresh. The story of the destruction of Troy at the hands of the Greeks. To her great credit she tells it straight, without the slightest visible straining for effect. Her perspective is interesting, too. This is a Troy seen from below, from the kitchens and the stables and (a wonderful notion) the Blood Room, where the wounded are tended by the young Xanthe. Geras's other triumph is the way she deals with the gods. They appear suddenly and naturally, to speak or intervene, and then vanish again, leaving us with the sense of a world governed by powers and riddled with jealousies only half understood by the suffering mortals. Every generation needs its version of this great story. This one, powerful, clear, and compassionate, is the best I've read for a long time. A Voyage of Discovery, Volume 1: From the Land of the Amazons to the Indigo Isles Fran\u00e7ois Place, translated by Aubrey Lawrence Pavilion, \u00a312.99 Fran\u00e7ois Place is an extraordinary artist, not quite like anyone else I can think of. A Voyage of Discovery is a series of prodigiously inventive landscapes in words and exquisite pictures. The concept is rather like that of Umberto Eco's Invisible Cities: different places, in this case entire fantastical countries, are described and drawn in as if by curious observers from elsewhere. The invention is astonishing: in Ba\u00eflaba\u00efkal, for example, they build parks among the reed-beds where they rear giant snakes. In spring, the snakes are taken to volcanoes of hot mud, where male midwives help them shed their skins; and the skins are then stretched over a framework of sticks to make canoes. The spirit of the snake lives on in the canoe, helping the boatmen to steer. This little vignette occupies a page, and no less than seven amazingly detailed pictures. In fine pen line and exquisite wash, Place brings both whole panoramas and tiny details to life. And this is only the first of a promised three volumes! It is a triumph of imagination and craftsmanship: one of the most amazing works I've ever seen.

Sono coloro che si sono impossessati delle strade, lasciate libere dalle auto. </p> <p>Secondo il Ministro dell'Ambiente \"le domeniche senz'auto stanno pian piano entrando nel DNA degli italiani\". Ma Grazia Francescato, presidente dei Verdi, puntualizza: \"Adesso bisogna pensare all'inquinamento del luned\u00ed, per cui servono al pi\u00f9 presto provvedimenti strutturali\". </p> <p> <strong> A che cosa attribuisci la responsabilit\u00e0 dell'inquinamento atmosferico nelle citt\u00e0 e come proponi di limitarlo? </strong></p> <p><strong>Mauro Baietto, 17 - </strong> La colpa \u00e8 soprattutto del traffico. Non si \u00e8 mai incoraggiato un uso razionale delle automobili. Ci sono persone che non escono mai senz'auto. Penso si debbano aumentare le limitazioni del traffico e i blocchi nelle citt\u00e0. E poi bisogna studiare e usare carburanti meno nocivi. </p> <p> <strong> Elena Bollero, 17 - </strong> I grandi responsabili sono il traffico, il riscaldamento delle case e l'industria. La responsabilit\u00e0 \u00e8 di chi amministra ma anche personale. Dovremmo imparare a regolare meglio il riscaldamento, usare una sola macchina in gruppo, fra compagni o colleghi di lavoro, riscoprire il treno, il bus, la bicicletta. Dobbiamo metterci in testa che le piccole iniziative possono fare pi\u00f9 dei divieti. </p> <p> <strong> Nicola Ambrosino, 19 - </strong> In Italia e a Torino in particolare c'\u00e8 un uso molto massiccio degli automezzi. L'ho notato viaggiando in Europa. L'automobile \u00e8 l'oggetto dei desideri di molti italiani. E non si sono sviluppate reti di servizi pubblici efficienti. Torino, ad esempio, avr\u00e0 una linea della metropolitana solo nel 2005, se tutto andr\u00e0 bene. </p> <p> <strong> Pietro La Camera, responsabile locale di Legambiente - </strong> L'inquinamento atmosferico ha molte concause: il traffico veicolare, gli impianti di riscaldamento, le emissioni delle industrie. </p> <p>La ricerca di soluzioni \u00e8 quindi articolata. Per quanto riguarda il traffico, bisogna eliminare quello pesante dalle citt\u00e0 e andare ad una legislazione, a livello europeo, che abbassi ulteriormente le emissioni delle auto. \u00c8 anche essenziale che siano potenziati i mezzi pubblici e si incoraggi un utilizzo diverso dell'automobile. </p> <p> <strong> Come giudichi le domeniche del pedone e che impressione ne hai avuto? </strong></p> <p><strong>Mauro - </strong> \u00c8 un inizio di soluzione. Significa che finalmente pensiamo al problema. Si risolve poco, comunque, dal punto di vista dell'inquinamento. Un solo blocco al mese non ha senso. </p> <p> <strong> Elena - </strong> Ritengo che sia una bella iniziativa culturalmente parlando. Insegna al cittadino a vivere la citt\u00e0 in maniera alternativa. Ma penso che per l'ambiente possa fare veramente poco. Anche i dati lo hanno detto: le polveri non sono diminuite. Comunque mi \u00e8 piaciuto vedere la gente in giro in bici o sui pattini. E poi che silenzio! </p> <p> <strong> Nicola - </strong> Una bella iniziativa per promuovere l'abbandono delle auto. Si incentiva la gente a spostarsi in altro modo, con i mezzi pubblici o a piedi. Sono stato in centro a Torino, il 5 marzo. Alcune vie erano piene di gente, sembrava di essere a un concerto. Una bella sensazione. In altre c'era gente in bicicletta, sui pattini o con mezzi \"sfiziosi\" come cavalli, risci\u00f2, carrozzelle. </p> <p> <strong> Pietro La Camera - </strong> Non crediamo, come ambientalisti, che le limitazioni o i blocchi del traffico possano risolvere il problema. Sicuramente non sono rimedi definitivi. Le consideriamo un primo passo, un'educazione del cittadino ad usare l'auto in modo pi\u00f9 intelligente. Le \"domeniche del pedone\" hanno anche insegnato alla gente a ritrovarsi, andare a piedi, fare un giro in bicicletta con gli amici: un'ecologia della vita in senso pi\u00f9 ampio. </p> <p>\u00c8 sorprendente come molti cittadini abbiano accettato volentieri questa \"imposizione\". </p> <p>Se si escludono gli irriducibili, quelli che non riescono a pensare in maniera altruistica, la maggioranza ha percepito e apprezzato l'aria pi\u00f9 respirabile, il silenzio. Ci si \u00e8 accorti che esiste anche un inquinamento acustico. Accorgersi di un problema pu\u00f2 sensibilizzare a non lasciarsi passare tutto sulla testa, a pretendere soluzioni durature dei problemi. </p> <p>Glossario/Glossary</p> <p> <strong> l'irriducibile</strong> diehard <br><strong> lasciarsi passare qualcosa sulla testa</strong> (idiom) to let oneself be trampled on <br><strong> Legambiente</strong> a leading environmental association <br><strong> il livello di guardia</strong> safety limit <br><strong> mettersi in testa</strong> (idiom) to understand <br><strong> l'oggetto dei desideri</strong> (coll.) dream <br><strong> l'ora di punta</strong> rush hour <br><strong> per cui</strong> therefore <br><strong> pian piano</strong> (coll.) gradually <br><strong> se andr\u00e0 bene</strong> (coll.) hopefully <br><strong> sfizioso</strong> extravagant <br><strong> i Verdi</strong> the Italian Green Party</p>",

L'ottanta per cento dei cittadini, invece, afferma di gradire il blocco. Sono coloro che si sono impossessati delle strade, lasciate libere dalle auto. Secondo il Ministro dell'Ambiente \"le domeniche senz'auto stanno pian piano entrando nel DNA degli italiani\". Ma Grazia Francescato, presidente dei Verdi, puntualizza: \"Adesso bisogna pensare all'inquinamento del luned\u00ed, per cui servono al pi\u00f9 presto provvedimenti strutturali\". A che cosa attribuisci la responsabilit\u00e0 dell'inquinamento atmosferico nelle citt\u00e0 e come proponi di limitarlo? Mauro Baietto, 17 - La colpa \u00e8 soprattutto del traffico. Non si \u00e8 mai incoraggiato un uso razionale delle automobili. Ci sono persone che non escono mai senz'auto. Penso si debbano aumentare le limitazioni del traffico e i blocchi nelle citt\u00e0. E poi bisogna studiare e usare carburanti meno nocivi. Elena Bollero, 17 - I grandi responsabili sono il traffico, il riscaldamento delle case e l'industria. La responsabilit\u00e0 \u00e8 di chi amministra ma anche personale. Dovremmo imparare a regolare meglio il riscaldamento, usare una sola macchina in gruppo, fra compagni o colleghi di lavoro, riscoprire il treno, il bus, la bicicletta. Dobbiamo metterci in testa che le piccole iniziative possono fare pi\u00f9 dei divieti. Nicola Ambrosino, 19 - In Italia e a Torino in particolare c'\u00e8 un uso molto massiccio degli automezzi. L'ho notato viaggiando in Europa. L'automobile \u00e8 l'oggetto dei desideri di molti italiani. E non si sono sviluppate reti di servizi pubblici efficienti. Torino, ad esempio, avr\u00e0 una linea della metropolitana solo nel 2005, se tutto andr\u00e0 bene. Pietro La Camera, responsabile locale di Legambiente - L'inquinamento atmosferico ha molte concause: il traffico veicolare, gli impianti di riscaldamento, le emissioni delle industrie. La ricerca di soluzioni \u00e8 quindi articolata. Per quanto riguarda il traffico, bisogna eliminare quello pesante dalle citt\u00e0 e andare ad una legislazione, a livello europeo, che abbassi ulteriormente le emissioni delle auto. \u00c8 anche essenziale che siano potenziati i mezzi pubblici e si incoraggi un utilizzo diverso dell'automobile. Come giudichi le domeniche del pedone e che impressione ne hai avuto? Mauro - \u00c8 un inizio di soluzione. Significa che finalmente pensiamo al problema. Si risolve poco, comunque, dal punto di vista dell'inquinamento. Un solo blocco al mese non ha senso. Elena - Ritengo che sia una bella iniziativa culturalmente parlando. Insegna al cittadino a vivere la citt\u00e0 in maniera alternativa. Ma penso che per l'ambiente possa fare veramente poco. Anche i dati lo hanno detto: le polveri non sono diminuite. Comunque mi \u00e8 piaciuto vedere la gente in giro in bici o sui pattini. E poi che silenzio! Nicola - Una bella iniziativa per promuovere l'abbandono delle auto. Si incentiva la gente a spostarsi in altro modo, con i mezzi pubblici o a piedi. Sono stato in centro a Torino, il 5 marzo. Alcune vie erano piene di gente, sembrava di essere a un concerto. Una bella sensazione. In altre c'era gente in bicicletta, sui pattini o con mezzi \"sfiziosi\" come cavalli, risci\u00f2, carrozzelle. Pietro La Camera - Non crediamo, come ambientalisti, che le limitazioni o i blocchi del traffico possano risolvere il problema. Sicuramente non sono rimedi definitivi. Le consideriamo un primo passo, un'educazione del cittadino ad usare l'auto in modo pi\u00f9 intelligente. Le \"domeniche del pedone\" hanno anche insegnato alla gente a ritrovarsi, andare a piedi, fare un giro in bicicletta con gli amici: un'ecologia della vita in senso pi\u00f9 ampio. \u00c8 sorprendente come molti cittadini abbiano accettato volentieri questa \"imposizione\". Se si escludono gli irriducibili, quelli che non riescono a pensare in maniera altruistica, la maggioranza ha percepito e apprezzato l'aria pi\u00f9 respirabile, il silenzio. Ci si \u00e8 accorti che esiste anche un inquinamento acustico. Accorgersi di un problema pu\u00f2 sensibilizzare a non lasciarsi passare tutto sulla testa, a pretendere soluzioni durature dei problemi.

Heaney began work on his Beowulf in the mid-80s, and one can see that rather than revising the text on screen, he printed out the work in progress and annotated it by hand.

Over nearly 15 years he composed seven alternative openings before settling for one. Similarly, in each draft one can see how some words, such as thole (meaning to endure or suffer), pop in and out of the text before Heaney decides it can stay. In the end there is nothing there that shouldn't be. </p> <p>The idea that the hand of an author is intimately connected to his or her manuscript is not new. The Romantics even took the idea literally: Shelley's ashes were wrapped in one of his manuscripts.</p> <p>Just how closely a poet should be identified with their work can also be inferred from manuscript. In 1812, Byron \"woke one morning\" to find himself famous after the publication of the first two cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. The poem describes the travels of a jaded young man looking for fresh experiences, and commentators have speculated whether Byron and Harold were one and the same. Byron claimed Harold was fictitious, but the proofs from the end of the second canto include Byron's comments on a more egotistical, \"affected\" alternative for the final two lines, suggesting the poem may be closer to autobiography than the poet was willing to admit. </p> <p>Elsewhere we find that Austen reworked the last chapters of Persuasion to give Ann Elliot a stronger role in getting Wentworth to declare his love, and that Wordsworth's Daffodils was a more collaborative effort than its mood would suggest; the manuscript was written out by his wife, Mary, who first began the poem: \"I wandered like a lonely...\" </p> <p>The 20th century is equally well represented. \"From the vigour and toughness of Sylvia Plath's Ariel you would expect to find a frantic and heavily worked manuscript,\" says Chris Fletcher, curator of manuscripts at the British Library. \"In fact, it is naively and girlishly written and is decorated with a small hand-drawn flower at the bottom.\" </p> <p>Wilfred Owen's Anthem for Doomed Youth is also revealing. \"For one thing, the title was not his,\" says Fletcher. \"His original title was Anthem for Dead Youth, which he changed at Siegfried Sassoon's suggestion. He worked to find the right words. 'Tenderness of mortal minds' is variously 'Tenderness of broken/simple/frail/innocent minds'.\" </p> <p>Yet sometimes a manuscript only confuses the issue. The 1816 published version of Coleridge's Kubla Khan conflicts with the poet's note on the manuscript that \"this fragment with a good deal more, not recoverable, composed, in a sort of Reverie brought on by two grains of opium, taken to check a dysentry, at a Farm House between Porlock &amp; Linton, a quarter of a mile from Culborne Church, in the fall of the year, 1797\". As Fletcher notes, the manuscript does not look opium-induced - it survives as a fair copy with one or two considered annotations. </p> <p>Manuscripts may offer a window into their author's soul, but sometimes the glass remains opaque.</p>",

The Romantics even took the idea literally: Shelley's ashes were wrapped in one of his manuscripts. Just how closely a poet should be identified with their work can also be inferred from manuscript. In 1812, Byron \"woke one morning\" to find himself famous after the publication of the first two cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. The poem describes the travels of a jaded young man looking for fresh experiences, and commentators have speculated whether Byron and Harold were one and the same. Byron claimed Harold was fictitious, but the proofs from the end of the second canto include Byron's comments on a more egotistical, \"affected\" alternative for the final two lines, suggesting the poem may be closer to autobiography than the poet was willing to admit. Elsewhere we find that Austen reworked the last chapters of Persuasion to give Ann Elliot a stronger role in getting Wentworth to declare his love, and that Wordsworth's Daffodils was a more collaborative effort than its mood would suggest; the manuscript was written out by his wife, Mary, who first began the poem: \"I wandered like a lonely...\" The 20th century is equally well represented. \"From the vigour and toughness of Sylvia Plath's Ariel you would expect to find a frantic and heavily worked manuscript,\" says Chris Fletcher, curator of manuscripts at the British Library. \"In fact, it is naively and girlishly written and is decorated with a small hand-drawn flower at the bottom.\" Wilfred Owen's Anthem for Doomed Youth is also revealing. \"For one thing, the title was not his,\" says Fletcher. \"His original title was Anthem for Dead Youth, which he changed at Siegfried Sassoon's suggestion. He worked to find the right words. 'Tenderness of mortal minds' is variously 'Tenderness of broken/simple/frail/innocent minds'.\" Yet sometimes a manuscript only confuses the issue. The 1816 published version of Coleridge's Kubla Khan conflicts with the poet's note on the manuscript that \"this fragment with a good deal more, not recoverable, composed, in a sort of Reverie brought on by two grains of opium, taken to check a dysentry, at a Farm House between Porlock &amp; Linton, a quarter of a mile from Culborne Church, in the fall of the year, 1797\". As Fletcher notes, the manuscript does not look opium-induced - it survives as a fair copy with one or two considered annotations. Manuscripts may offer a window into their author's soul, but sometimes the glass remains opaque.",

Perhaps only the worst blunderer will imagine that Austen's Fanny Price did actually find Henry Crawford and Maria Bertram in energetic flagrante in one of the spare rooms. Or that she ever purged her passions by rapturously riding a stallion out into the storm-tossed night. (Characters who go out in the rain in Austen novels usually suffer for it.)

In Swift's book the protagonist actually ends up living in a stable with herbs rammed up his nostrils to keep out the stench of his family.

How many viewers noticed? </p> <p>In remaking the classics, film-makers and literary critics are often in cahoots. The film of Mansfield Park is full of references to slavery. Fanny Price even discovers a sketchbook of the horrors perpetrated by Sir Thomas Bertram on the slaves who work his Antiguan plantations. These clearly echo the ways in which the novel has been \"reinterpreted\" by critical postcolonialist academics such as Edward Said. </p> <p>And Patricia Rozema has said that her reborn Fanny was influenced by feminist academics writing on Austen. It is a nice irony that academics, ingeniously finding their own political agendas in the novel, have inspired a film that is so different from the book their students are supposed to read. </p> <p>\u0095 John Mullan is a senior lecturer in English at University College London.

In Swift's book the protagonist actually ends up living in a stable with herbs rammed up his nostrils to keep out the stench of his family. Riskier are more attentive adaptations such as the recent BBC Great Expectations, wooing us at first with its closeness to the novel, yet willing completely to change the novel's ending. How many viewers noticed? In remaking the classics, film-makers and literary critics are often in cahoots. The film of Mansfield Park is full of references to slavery. Fanny Price even discovers a sketchbook of the horrors perpetrated by Sir Thomas Bertram on the slaves who work his Antiguan plantations. These clearly echo the ways in which the novel has been \"reinterpreted\" by critical postcolonialist academics such as Edward Said. And Patricia Rozema has said that her reborn Fanny was influenced by feminist academics writing on Austen. It is a nice irony that academics, ingeniously finding their own political agendas in the novel, have inspired a film that is so different from the book their students are supposed to read. \u0095 John Mullan is a senior lecturer in English at University College London. Mansfield Park is released on Friday.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>My argument today is this.</p> <p>\u0095 Britain is stronger together, than separated apart.</p> <p>\u0095 True Britishness lies in our values not unchanging institutions.</p> <p>\u0095 The Constitutional changes we have made and a new attitude of engagement with Europe are not a threat to British identity but on the contrary are the means of strengthening it for today's world.</p> <p>My manifesto for the leadership of the Labour Party in 1994 was called change and national renewal. A lot has changed since then. But those words remain central to my vision of what politics in this country must be about. <br><br> We have to recognise the huge changes we are living through and the challenges they present to this country. But also the opportunities for renewal that they offer. <br><br> Standing up for our country means standing up for what we believe in. It means standing up for our values and having the strength to realise them in the modern world. It means standing up for the core British values of fair play, creativity, tolerance and an outward-looking approach to the world. It does not mean an unthinking resistance to change. It does not mean railing against the outside world. <br><br> Modernisation is the key. It has driven everything this government has done - whether in our constitutional reforms or our reforms of the health service or the education system or the system of criminal justice or our relations with Europe. <br><br> To fail to modernise would be fundamentally to fail Britain. But we modernise according to our core values as a country. And we do so on the basis of one key belief. That the United Kingdom is stronger together than apart; all the constituent elements of the Union: its great cities, regions and nations are stronger united than separate, stronger together than the sum of their parts. <br><br> Our national identity is not some remote and abstract issue. <br><br> National success is not a matter of pushing buttons and pulling levers. Long-term growth and prosperity and stability depend on a clear sense of shared objectives and shared responsibilities. <br><br> Our failure in the post-war period to generate a clear sense of national purpose has hindered us. <br><br> It left space for a culture to develop in which sectional social and economic interests have fought to secure rights for themselves without a corresponding sense of their obligations to work for the wider public interest as well. <br><br> Indeed, I believe that the origins of one of the greatest failings of the economy in the post-war period - short-termism - can be located in our lack of a clear national purpose. <br><br> Throughout the post-war period, in the absence of a shared long-term vision of where we were going, successive governments often succumbed to the temptations of boom-and-bust, successive generations of managers often focused on their own pay awards instead of the long-term performance of their companies and successive generations of workers often sought pay increases unjustified by productivity increases. <br><br> We are living through a period of unprecedented change. The exponential growth of information and communication technologies is transforming the world's economies and making them increasingly interdependent. The breakup of the postwar international order and globalisation are calling into question systems constructed around the nation state. New ideologies of personal liberation and opportunities for self-fulfillment, made possible by social and economic change, are transforming traditional social structures and turning some inwards to themselves rather than looking outward to the nation and the state. <br><br> In this new world, it has become increasingly fashionable to predict the death of the nation-state. A world in which capital crosses national frontiers at the push of a key, where air travel has made the outside world personally familiar to millions, where television has brought it into the homes of millions more, a world where supra-national organisations like the EU and WTO play an increasingly important role is a world where questions are inevitably going to arise about the continuing significance of national identity. <br><br> What is the answer to such a challenge? Not to retreat into the past or cling to the status quo, even if it cannot sensibly be justified; but to rediscover from first principles what it is that makes us British and to develop that identity in a way in tune with the modern world. <br><br> What makes Britain and Britishness important, valid, as necessary today as ever is a powerful combination of shared values and mutual self-interest. We are stronger together, economically and politically with the nations of the UK able to maximise their collective will and authority. In defence, foreign policy, economic weight, we are better off and stronger together. <br><br> But, more important, our identity is not threatened by change. Our identity lies in our shared values not in unchanging institutions. <br><br> It is when our values fail to be reflected in the institutions that govern us that Britain and British identity is under threat. When we came to office, the Party of no change - the Conservatives - were left without any seats in Scotland or Wales. Forces for change were left with no alternative but status quo or separatism. Devolution at long last offered a sensible modernisation of the partnership in the UK. Let Scotland and Wales do what they do best locally. Let the UK do what it is right to do together. <br><br> The Conservative Party, in the Tory policy document on five guarantees for Britain, proposes \"English votes for English laws\". While rejecting a proposal to set up a wholly separate English parliament and now today re-affirming that they support devolution, they propose to exclude the Scots, Welsh and Irish from any discussion of laws defined as \"English\". The rest of Britain's MPs would, in effect, become second class citizens in the UK Parliament - voting on some issues but not on all of them - and the make-up of the executive would have to reflect the possibility of defeat on English issues even if a majority was available for British issues. <br><br> But what their proposal reflects is a complete misunderstanding of reality. <br><br> The measures needed to protect a minority are not always the same as the measures needed to protect a majority. England can if it chooses outvote Scotland, Ireland and Wales at any point. English MPs are in an overwhelming majority in voting through the money for Wales and Scotland. It is the recognition of this that makes devolution a fairer settlement for the future. <br><br> The growing pressure for regional change in England - decentralisation in London, the first steps to better local government in our cities - are a logical consequence of the policy of modernisation. <br><br> In Northern Ireland - if, as I do, we value the Union - we had to make progress on fairness and a recognition of nationalist aspirations. What we then are left with is an identity not shaped by institutional rigidity, but by values and common purpose. That purpose is a Britain that is stronger, fairer, modernised to be fit for the new world we live in. That is a constant recurrent theme in all the Government does: modernisation based on values. The NHS is not just a necessary part of a civilised society where need not wealth should determine health care. It is a unifying force. It is a true British service. It represents the best of British values in action. But it has to be updated and reformed to take account of the new opportunities and challenges of today. <br><br> On Europe, standing up for Britain does not mean being anti-Europe. It is not pro-British to be anti-Europe. The EU is part of the modern world. Britain is part of the EU. Standing up for Britain means fighting for British values, getting the best for Britain, whether it is economic reform, moving Europe closer to the USA or protecting the British rebate. <br><br> Likewise, at a time when individuals have been becoming increasingly empowered in their personal lives and increasingly aspire - and rightly so - to the prerogatives of citizenship, how could a healthy body politic defend the political privileges of hereditary peers and deny the right to freedom of information and to the protection in British courts of the European Convention on Human Rights ? <br><br> I believe few would disagree with the qualities that go towards that British identity: qualities of creativity built on tolerance, openness and adaptability, work and self-improvement, strong communities and families and fair play, rights and responsibilities and an outward looking approach to the world that all flow from our unique island geography and history. <br><br> If these values are what makes us British, rather than unchanging institutions, the devolution is a necessary part of keeping Britain together; more regional decentralisation in England makes sense, City mayors with real power have their place; hereditary peers in the House of Lords don't; and a constructive engaged attitude to Europe reflects the best of British values of openness and leadership in the world. <br><br> Of course, there will always be those who argue the consequences of change will always be worse than the consequences of sustaining the status quo. <br><br> But, I think this is as much a cast of mind as a political analysis. And this criticism usually falls into one of two broad categories - both of which play essentially on atavistic fears of the future. <br><br> The first category of criticism is a traditional Tory one - based on the claim that the pre-devolution, pre-reformed House of Lords, political institutions have been a uniquely important part of British national identity. Changing them, in this view, destroys something quintessentially 'British'. <br><br> Of course they have been historically significant, but they have never been anything more than a reflection of the needs of the British people at any one time. They are not eternal expressions of the British character. To change them does not mean that something quintessentially British has been destroyed, that a part of 'Britain has gone. <br><br> On the contrary, it is quintessentially British, it is one of our distinguishing characteristics as a people, that we have always been willing to adapt our institutions to changing circumstances. In the 19th century, in response to tumultuous economic and social change, we reformed the suffrage not once but three times. <br><br> This first critique amounts to little more than sentimental nostalgia. <br><br> The second critique is more argued: that somehow a process has been unshackled which will not run its course until the Union has disintegrated - that the institutional recognition of complex and enriching plural allegiances will somehow lead - inevitably - to their replacement with simpler and more excluding identities. <br><br> And, of course, there are those, like the SNP, who argue that this would be positively desirable and that the Union has had its day and the sooner it is unravelled, the better. <br><br> Of course, the great currents in our national life which have produced the climate in which such radical constitutional reform became necessary and was implemented will not suddenly cease. Of course they will continue to flow. <br><br> But this does not dictate a retreat from an inclusive British identity to more exclusive identities, rooted in 19th century conceptions of territory and blood? It is actually just not possible to construct any practical and meaningful national identity on such a basis. Why should we want to? <br><br> 20 per cent of the population of Wales was born in England 7 per cent of the population of Scotland was born in England <br><br> 745,000 people born in Scotland live in England: equivalent to 15% of the Scottish population. <br><br> Why should anyone want to say to all these people that they should suddenly become foreigners in the land they live in ? <br><br> This nation has been formed by a particularly rich complex of experiences: successive waves of invasion and immigration and trading partnerships, a potent mix of cultures and traditions which have flowed together to make us what we are today. <br><br> Blood alone does not define our national identity. How can we separate out the Celtic, the Roman, the Saxon, the Norman, the Huguenot, the Jewish,- the Asian and the Caribbean and all the other nations that have come and settled here ? Why should we want to ? It is precisely this rich mix that has made all of us what we are today. <br><br> Both current critiques of our constitutional reforms, I believe, are rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between a democratic people and the institutions they consent to have rule over them. New institutions do not necessarily create new feelings. They can just give longheld feelings new - and often better - expression. <br><br> 'This government's progressive programme of constitutional reform is now moving us from a centralised Britain, where power flowed top-down, to a devolved and plural state. A new Britain is emerging with a revitalised conception of citizenship, as the House of Lords finally is reformed to remove the democratic anomaly of the hereditary peers, as the European Convention of Human Rights is incorporated into British law and as we bring in, for the first time, rights to Freedom of Information. <br><br> This is a complex journey towards a revived sense of ourselves, applying to modern life historic British values and qualities. <br><br> I entered politics to fight for the changes I believe are necessary to modernise this country. I believe in the importance of preserving our British identity and I will fight to strengthen the Union. I will fight against all those who would weaken the Union, whether those forces of conservatism who oppose change on principle or those separatist nationalists who wish to see Britain die.' <br><br> Our vision is of a Britain that thrives on optimism, on shaping its own destiny not cowering before the might of the global economy. <br><br> For us Britain succeeds when we ally our courage to our imagination. The courage that won wars. The imagination that built the NHS. <br><br> Ours is a vision of Britain where pride comes from a strong economy that can compete in the world, and rising living standards that benefits all. <br><br> A Britain where pride comes from a modern constitution that strengthens the nations of the United Kingdom. <br><br> Where pride comes from strengthening British values - creativity helping us build a knowledge economy, fairness guiding our fight against child poverty, reward for hard work helping us return to full employment, rights matched by responsibilities guiding us in the fight against crime and the reform of welfare. <br><br> Ours is an outward looking vision that believes in Britain's place in Europe, but believes Britain will always be much more than that. A \"pivotal\" nation - a bridge between East and West between the United States and the EU. <br><br> In this new world, a new modern patriotism is needed. That is what we offer. <br><br> See Britain as it is seen from abroad today. An economy gaining in strength. A society seeking to combine enterprise with investment in public services that bind the nation together. A politics that from relations within the UK, to pursuing peace in Northern Ireland, to engaging with Europe, is prepared to change to overcome the problems of the past and rise to the challenges of a changing world. <br><br> We can have confidence in our future. Britain is no longer in decline. We are rediscovering our strength and values. We are uniting those values to a common purpose: modernising the nation for the 21st Century. If we succeed, Britain will be stronger and fairer, on the road to providing opportunity and security for all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My argument today is this. \u0095 Britain is stronger together, than separated apart. \u0095 True Britishness lies in our values not unchanging institutions. \u0095 The Constitutional changes we have made and a new attitude of engagement with Europe are not a threat to British identity but on the contrary are the means of strengthening it for today's world. My manifesto for the leadership of the Labour Party in 1994 was called change and national renewal. A lot has changed since then. But those words remain central to my vision of what politics in this country must be about. We have to recognise the huge changes we are living through and the challenges they present to this country. But also the opportunities for renewal that they offer. Standing up for our country means standing up for what we believe in. It means standing up for our values and having the strength to realise them in the modern world. It means standing up for the core British values of fair play, creativity, tolerance and an outward-looking approach to the world. It does not mean an unthinking resistance to change. It does not mean railing against the outside world. Modernisation is the key. It has driven everything this government has done - whether in our constitutional reforms or our reforms of the health service or the education system or the system of criminal justice or our relations with Europe. To fail to modernise would be fundamentally to fail Britain. But we modernise according to our core values as a country. And we do so on the basis of one key belief. That the United Kingdom is stronger together than apart; all the constituent elements of the Union: its great cities, regions and nations are stronger united than separate, stronger together than the sum of their parts. Our national identity is not some remote and abstract issue. National success is not a matter of pushing buttons and pulling levers. Long-term growth and prosperity and stability depend on a clear sense of shared objectives and shared responsibilities. Our failure in the post-war period to generate a clear sense of national purpose has hindered us. It left space for a culture to develop in which sectional social and economic interests have fought to secure rights for themselves without a corresponding sense of their obligations to work for the wider public interest as well. Indeed, I believe that the origins of one of the greatest failings of the economy in the post-war period - short-termism - can be located in our lack of a clear national purpose. Throughout the post-war period, in the absence of a shared long-term vision of where we were going, successive governments often succumbed to the temptations of boom-and-bust, successive generations of managers often focused on their own pay awards instead of the long-term performance of their companies and successive generations of workers often sought pay increases unjustified by productivity increases. We are living through a period of unprecedented change. The exponential growth of information and communication technologies is transforming the world's economies and making them increasingly interdependent. The breakup of the postwar international order and globalisation are calling into question systems constructed around the nation state. New ideologies of personal liberation and opportunities for self-fulfillment, made possible by social and economic change, are transforming traditional social structures and turning some inwards to themselves rather than looking outward to the nation and the state. In this new world, it has become increasingly fashionable to predict the death of the nation-state. A world in which capital crosses national frontiers at the push of a key, where air travel has made the outside world personally familiar to millions, where television has brought it into the homes of millions more, a world where supra-national organisations like the EU and WTO play an increasingly important role is a world where questions are inevitably going to arise about the continuing significance of national identity. What is the answer to such a challenge? Not to retreat into the past or cling to the status quo, even if it cannot sensibly be justified; but to rediscover from first principles what it is that makes us British and to develop that identity in a way in tune with the modern world. What makes Britain and Britishness important, valid, as necessary today as ever is a powerful combination of shared values and mutual self-interest. We are stronger together, economically and politically with the nations of the UK able to maximise their collective will and authority. In defence, foreign policy, economic weight, we are better off and stronger together. But, more important, our identity is not threatened by change. Our identity lies in our shared values not in unchanging institutions. It is when our values fail to be reflected in the institutions that govern us that Britain and British identity is under threat. When we came to office, the Party of no change - the Conservatives - were left without any seats in Scotland or Wales. Forces for change were left with no alternative but status quo or separatism. Devolution at long last offered a sensible modernisation of the partnership in the UK. Let Scotland and Wales do what they do best locally. Let the UK do what it is right to do together. The Conservative Party, in the Tory policy document on five guarantees for Britain, proposes \"English votes for English laws\". While rejecting a proposal to set up a wholly separate English parliament and now today re-affirming that they support devolution, they propose to exclude the Scots, Welsh and Irish from any discussion of laws defined as \"English\". The rest of Britain's MPs would, in effect, become second class citizens in the UK Parliament - voting on some issues but not on all of them - and the make-up of the executive would have to reflect the possibility of defeat on English issues even if a majority was available for British issues. But what their proposal reflects is a complete misunderstanding of reality. The measures needed to protect a minority are not always the same as the measures needed to protect a majority. England can if it chooses outvote Scotland, Ireland and Wales at any point. English MPs are in an overwhelming majority in voting through the money for Wales and Scotland. It is the recognition of this that makes devolution a fairer settlement for the future. The growing pressure for regional change in England - decentralisation in London, the first steps to better local government in our cities - are a logical consequence of the policy of modernisation. In Northern Ireland - if, as I do, we value the Union - we had to make progress on fairness and a recognition of nationalist aspirations. What we then are left with is an identity not shaped by institutional rigidity, but by values and common purpose. That purpose is a Britain that is stronger, fairer, modernised to be fit for the new world we live in. That is a constant recurrent theme in all the Government does: modernisation based on values. The NHS is not just a necessary part of a civilised society where need not wealth should determine health care. It is a unifying force. It is a true British service. It represents the best of British values in action. But it has to be updated and reformed to take account of the new opportunities and challenges of today. On Europe, standing up for Britain does not mean being anti-Europe. It is not pro-British to be anti-Europe. The EU is part of the modern world. Britain is part of the EU. Standing up for Britain means fighting for British values, getting the best for Britain, whether it is economic reform, moving Europe closer to the USA or protecting the British rebate. Likewise, at a time when individuals have been becoming increasingly empowered in their personal lives and increasingly aspire - and rightly so - to the prerogatives of citizenship, how could a healthy body politic defend the political privileges of hereditary peers and deny the right to freedom of information and to the protection in British courts of the European Convention on Human Rights ? I believe few would disagree with the qualities that go towards that British identity: qualities of creativity built on tolerance, openness and adaptability, work and self-improvement, strong communities and families and fair play, rights and responsibilities and an outward looking approach to the world that all flow from our unique island geography and history. If these values are what makes us British, rather than unchanging institutions, the devolution is a necessary part of keeping Britain together; more regional decentralisation in England makes sense, City mayors with real power have their place; hereditary peers in the House of Lords don't; and a constructive engaged attitude to Europe reflects the best of British values of openness and leadership in the world. Of course, there will always be those who argue the consequences of change will always be worse than the consequences of sustaining the status quo. But, I think this is as much a cast of mind as a political analysis. And this criticism usually falls into one of two broad categories - both of which play essentially on atavistic fears of the future. The first category of criticism is a traditional Tory one - based on the claim that the pre-devolution, pre-reformed House of Lords, political institutions have been a uniquely important part of British national identity. Changing them, in this view, destroys something quintessentially 'British'. Of course they have been historically significant, but they have never been anything more than a reflection of the needs of the British people at any one time. They are not eternal expressions of the British character. To change them does not mean that something quintessentially British has been destroyed, that a part of 'Britain has gone. On the contrary, it is quintessentially British, it is one of our distinguishing characteristics as a people, that we have always been willing to adapt our institutions to changing circumstances. In the 19th century, in response to tumultuous economic and social change, we reformed the suffrage not once but three times. This first critique amounts to little more than sentimental nostalgia. The second critique is more argued: that somehow a process has been unshackled which will not run its course until the Union has disintegrated - that the institutional recognition of complex and enriching plural allegiances will somehow lead - inevitably - to their replacement with simpler and more excluding identities. And, of course, there are those, like the SNP, who argue that this would be positively desirable and that the Union has had its day and the sooner it is unravelled, the better. Of course, the great currents in our national life which have produced the climate in which such radical constitutional reform became necessary and was implemented will not suddenly cease. Of course they will continue to flow. But this does not dictate a retreat from an inclusive British identity to more exclusive identities, rooted in 19th century conceptions of territory and blood? It is actually just not possible to construct any practical and meaningful national identity on such a basis. Why should we want to? 20 per cent of the population of Wales was born in England 7 per cent of the population of Scotland was born in England 745,000 people born in Scotland live in England: equivalent to 15% of the Scottish population. Why should anyone want to say to all these people that they should suddenly become foreigners in the land they live in ? This nation has been formed by a particularly rich complex of experiences: successive waves of invasion and immigration and trading partnerships, a potent mix of cultures and traditions which have flowed together to make us what we are today. Blood alone does not define our national identity. How can we separate out the Celtic, the Roman, the Saxon, the Norman, the Huguenot, the Jewish,- the Asian and the Caribbean and all the other nations that have come and settled here ? Why should we want to ? It is precisely this rich mix that has made all of us what we are today. Both current critiques of our constitutional reforms, I believe, are rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between a democratic people and the institutions they consent to have rule over them. New institutions do not necessarily create new feelings. They can just give longheld feelings new - and often better - expression. 'This government's progressive programme of constitutional reform is now moving us from a centralised Britain, where power flowed top-down, to a devolved and plural state. A new Britain is emerging with a revitalised conception of citizenship, as the House of Lords finally is reformed to remove the democratic anomaly of the hereditary peers, as the European Convention of Human Rights is incorporated into British law and as we bring in, for the first time, rights to Freedom of Information. This is a complex journey towards a revived sense of ourselves, applying to modern life historic British values and qualities. I entered politics to fight for the changes I believe are necessary to modernise this country. I believe in the importance of preserving our British identity and I will fight to strengthen the Union. I will fight against all those who would weaken the Union, whether those forces of conservatism who oppose change on principle or those separatist nationalists who wish to see Britain die.' Our vision is of a Britain that thrives on optimism, on shaping its own destiny not cowering before the might of the global economy. For us Britain succeeds when we ally our courage to our imagination. The courage that won wars. The imagination that built the NHS. Ours is a vision of Britain where pride comes from a strong economy that can compete in the world, and rising living standards that benefits all.

Where pride comes from strengthening British values - creativity helping us build a knowledge economy, fairness guiding our fight against child poverty, reward for hard work helping us return to full employment, rights matched by responsibilities guiding us in the fight against crime and the reform of welfare.

But the view that it is fairer to scrap it totally rather than let only some institutions keep it seems to have wide currency. </p> <p>Key details are still being worked out, Stephen Grix, newly appointed head of Ofsted's post-compulsory education division, stressed to a conference of college principals and senior managers. </p> <p>The proposed inspection framework is due to be published \"before Easter\", together with a consultation document, he told the Association of College Management annual conference in Cardiff. </p> <p>Some principals were clearly frustrated that it is still not fixed whether the new regime will carry out full inspections on first visits. Under the existing system only part of an institution's provision was scrutinised during the first four-year cycle of inspections, from 1993 to 1997. </p> <p>\"In the new model you're going to see much more about teaching and learning and about what is being called the effectiveness of teaching and management,\" said Grix, currently principal of Sir George Monoux sixth-form college, Walthamstow, who doesn't start his new job until May 2. </p> <p>The five separate strands of administration known as \"cross-college provision\" - support for students, general resources, quality assurance, governance, and management - will be boiled down to one: organisational effectiveness and efficiency. </p> <p>This is expected to free up many more inspector-hours for sitting in on lectures. Current inspections typically look at just four curriculum areas. That number could double. </p> <p>Self-assessment by institutions of their provision, a central plank of the present inspection regime, looks likely to survive. And colleges are likely to be able to continue to nominate a member of staff to join the inspection team. But as Ofsted head Chris Woodhead has already said, the nominee may not in future be admitted to all meetings of the inspectors as \"this might inhibit free and frank discussion\". </p> <p>Schools inspection teams do not include a staff nominee. </p> <p>\"We are trying to have a model to make it easier to compare between school sixth forms and post-16 providers,\" said Grix. </p> <p>Woodhead has also revealed that teachers will be told the grades inspectors award them. </p> <p>Principals from the 25 colleges which now look certain to have their second-cycle inspections carried out under the new regime were anxious to know whether they would remain eligible for cash under the Standards Fund. Under the funding council inspections colleges which excelled or scored low four and five grades in curriculum areas received extra money from the fund. This also has not been decided yet.</p>",

And it looks unlikely that colleges awarded \"accredited\" status by the funding council inspectorate will continue with their privileges of \"lighter touch\" inspections and greater independence from official scrutiny. No final decision has been taken on whether accredited status will be recognised under the new Common Inspection Framework, currently being thrashed out by Ofsted, the funding council and the Training and Skills Council. But the view that it is fairer to scrap it totally rather than let only some institutions keep it seems to have wide currency. Key details are still being worked out, Stephen Grix, newly appointed head of Ofsted's post-compulsory education division, stressed to a conference of college principals and senior managers. The proposed inspection framework is due to be published \"before Easter\", together with a consultation document, he told the Association of College Management annual conference in Cardiff. Some principals were clearly frustrated that it is still not fixed whether the new regime will carry out full inspections on first visits. Under the existing system only part of an institution's provision was scrutinised during the first four-year cycle of inspections, from 1993 to 1997. \"In the new model you're going to see much more about teaching and learning and about what is being called the effectiveness of teaching and management,\" said Grix, currently principal of Sir George Monoux sixth-form college, Walthamstow, who doesn't start his new job until May 2. The five separate strands of administration known as \"cross-college provision\" - support for students, general resources, quality assurance, governance, and management - will be boiled down to one: organisational effectiveness and efficiency. This is expected to free up many more inspector-hours for sitting in on lectures. Current inspections typically look at just four curriculum areas. That number could double. Self-assessment by institutions of their provision, a central plank of the present inspection regime, looks likely to survive. And colleges are likely to be able to continue to nominate a member of staff to join the inspection team. But as Ofsted head Chris Woodhead has already said, the nominee may not in future be admitted to all meetings of the inspectors as \"this might inhibit free and frank discussion\". Schools inspection teams do not include a staff nominee. \"We are trying to have a model to make it easier to compare between school sixth forms and post-16 providers,\" said Grix. Woodhead has also revealed that teachers will be told the grades inspectors award them. Principals from the 25 colleges which now look certain to have their second-cycle inspections carried out under the new regime were anxious to know whether they would remain eligible for cash under the Standards Fund. Under the funding council inspections colleges which excelled or scored low four and five grades in curriculum areas received extra money from the fund. This also has not been decided yet.",

If you find them worryingly \"in your face\", perhaps you should put it down to a sense of humour failure. But as every woman knows, female friendships are often no laughing matter. </p> <p>Lily Fraser was in year 1 at her mixed north London primary school when she started coming home in a bad mood, saying she had had a horrible time. There would often be tears at bedtime. Lily had been in what her mother, Liz, thought was the enviable position of having three best friends. However, they made new best friends. Lily was bereft. </p> <p>\"By year 2 things got really difficult,\" Liz explains. \"The pattern of one-to-one friendships Lily understood expanded to playing complicated role-play games. Lily would complain about the others not wanting to play her versions, and it was only after prompting that I realised how convoluted the protocol was,\" Liz says. \"Someone would have ownership of the game and decide who was going to be what. To be elected as the big brother or the mother was grossly insulting. If Lily couldn't be what she wanted she'd get upset, but that got her nowhere. \" </p> <p>Liz realises with hindsight that the unhappy times in the playground may have lasted only a few minutes, but that they were what Lily remembered. Now she and her classmates are reaching the grand old age of seven, they are more relaxed and compromise more, although she can still come home upset. </p> <p>\"I think she has a really good network of friends, but she doesn't always see it like that. If she has a big falling out with one of them occasionally, she'll still say 'nobody at school likes me' or 'I've been left out'. You have to have quite roundabout conversations to find out that this means they are not playing the game the way she wants to. She is the oldest of two, and a lot of it is about accepting that things can't always go her way.\" </p> <p>If the pressure of playground life in a mixed school seems intense, what happens when there are no boys to leaven the mix? Jenny Walwyn has three daughters, all at private, single-sex schools in London. Dora, her youngest, is in a class of only 18 girls who will stay together for seven years. </p> <p>\"Most of them seem to divide up into pairs, but during her first years there Dora didn't have a special friend and felt there was something wrong with her,\" Jenny recalls. \"It's taken years but I've tried to persuade her that it is not necessary to have just one best friend. If there is a particular focus on one child and things get stormy, it affects everything else.\" </p> <p>Jenny noticed that at her oldest girl's secondary school, staff went out of their way to encourage different groupings and avoid focusing on one friendship. \"That made me feel confident to use this strategy with Dora,\" says Jenny. \"She still forms close attachments and there are ups and downs, but the fact that she's able to focus on lots of different people has helped.\" Jenny also tries to ease the pressure by encouraging Dora to see different friends at weekends, particularly boys. </p> <p>Child's play? Not at all, says Dr David Campbell, consultant clinical psychologist in the child and family department of the Tavistock Clinic in north London, who explains that children as young as seven are busy establishing their identity outside the family. \"They are developing relationships that give them feedback about what kind of person they are - pretty, sporty, aggressive etc. It's a very important time from a psychological point of view. These experiences are so new to them that they need to establish patterns - what would it be like if I played dolls with this girl, or football with the other. As they get older, relationships become more routine and predictable. </p> <p>\"Psychological theories indicate that women are more likely to find their identity through relationships than boys, who define themselves more through activities,\" he adds. \"At first, rejections are extremely painful for girls, so they can seem much more important than they really are.\" He points out that the oldest child may feel more threatened by relationships that go wrong. \"If they lose a girlfriend at school, it reverberates with all their past experiences of losing out to siblings.\" </p> <p>Dr Campbell suggests that parents try to promote the understanding that there are good times and bad times in the best of relationships, and that the downs are not always permanent. \"So much of it has to do with family values,\" he says. </p> <p>At West Kidlington Primary School in Oxfordshire, the mantra is \"to find a friend you have to be one\", and when the headteacher, Linda Rafferty, arrived in January she immediately felt the strength and quality of friendships right across the school. There is no differentiation made between genders, but as well as a school council, buddy system and Circle Time, there is a strong emphasis on the promotion of values. </p> <p>Here Rafferty is carrying on the pioneering work of the former head, Neil Hawkes, now a special adviser for the county. \"Over a two-year cycle we concentrate on 22 values, one for each month excluding August. In January and February it was respect and love, this month it's courage. They are talked about in assembly and during class reflection time and discussions as well as in written work. It all makes children more aware of how their own actions affect others, and helps to raise self-esteem,\" Rafferty explains. </p> <p> Staff at the 470-pupil school, which is in a mixed catchment area, are carefully selected for their ability to work in a team with respect and humour, as a model for pupils. Dinner-hall and playground supervisors are included. This is, after all, where learning to be friends mainly goes on. \"Inconsistency there means you could lose the whole thing completely,\" Rafferty admits. Parents are kept informed through newsletters informing them of the value of the month and so on, in the hope that they will support the ethos at home. </p> <p>By year 6, girls will probably have settled into more consistent relationships, but the move to secondary school and increasing sexual awareness can change all that. Wendy Granditer, agony aunt for teenage magazine Sugar, gets hundreds of letters on the subject. </p> <p>\"Girls can be desperate to be in with the in-crowd,\" she says. \"They'll ditch an old primary school mate for friends who they think will serve their image better. If one friend gets a nice boyfriend, the other can feel very lonely and excluded, and it can turn into a spiteful battle.\" </p> <p>Granditer advises trying to get things in perspective. \"t may just be a flash in the pan - you are enemies now but you'll be best friends again next week. It's about learning that good friends really appreciate each other, and how to patch things up. This is an important skill because it's about learning to negotiate and function in a relationship. </p> <p>\"Mothers should try to boost confidence,\" Granditer says. \"Tell your daughter she's great, she's special, the girl she's fallen out with will probably feel sorry and it will all blow over the next day. Bitchy comments can't do you any real harm. It's about the other person, not yourself.\" </p> <p>But supportive mother-teenage daughter relationships can be easier in theory than in practice. \"Teenage girls are much more likely to speak to their friends than speak to you,\" says Isobel Bletcher, head of the behaviour support centre at Madras College, a 1,800-pupil mixed comprehensive in Fyfe. </p> <p>Her view is based on extensive research, and her practice includes a peer counselling system. Older pupils volunteer to help younger ones with relationships with teachers and schoolmates, as well as with academic work. She currently has 121 sixth-year students on her scheme, as well as students from St Andrew's University. The scheme was inspired by the work of Andrew Bell, who founded the school in 1833, and his peer system of education in which older pupils taught younger ones. </p> <p>\"School is the only time in your life when you will find yourself in a room with 30 other people and be expected to get on with them just because they are the same age as you,\" Bletcher says. \"Support from people of different ages can really help.\" Friendship skills groups are available to those with serious problems, based on the views of students. Older ones might also be encouraged to offer low-key support to a girl who has had a bust-up with her best friend, for example. </p> <p>Bletcher believes that parents have had an enormous influence on the way their children interact with friends by adolescence. Her advice is: \"Offer help and wait for the reaction. You can break down the door and say, tell me what's wrong, but that doesn't mean they are going to speak to you. Listen to what they are saying and not what you think they are saying because you think you know them so well. The chances are that by the time they are adolescent you don't know them as well as you thought you did.\" </p> <p>Melanie and Paula, two 17-year-olds who are counsellors at Madras, agree that it is easier to talk to other girls. Melanie feels that encouraging them to form bigger groups of friends is important because it helps if you fall out with one of them. Paula points out that boys are more likely to make friends through sport. \"Very intellectual girls often feel left out, too, because although they are more mature academically, their social skills haven't caught up,\" she says. </p> <p>At the all-girls grammar school that Isobel Williams, 16, attends in the north-west of England, there is no special help beyond the usual personal and social development lessons. She agrees that being able to talk to someone nearer your own age is much easier. \"You have to have a lot of confidence to talk to an adult you don't really know,\" she says. </p> <p>Isobel is part of a group of about five close friends. \"I never really fall out with any of them,\" she says. \"Sometimes there's a bit of tension over pathetic things but it all blows over. It does get more complicated when boys come on the scene, but you work out who you can talk to about them and who you can't.\" Isobel rates respect and trust as essential qualities in a good friend and puts loudmouths at the top of her list of people to avoid. </p> <p>Ooh stick you, Daphne and Celeste.</p> <p><strong>Cope with your mates</strong></p> <p>Sometimes your friend might seem to be ignoring you or have turned on you for no obvious reason. Feeling left out is horrible. What can you do in that situation? </p> <p>\u0095 Don't keep it to yourself - tell your mum or another friend. </p> <p>\u0095 If one particular person in the group is being unpleasant, why not talk to someone else in the group at another time, to try to find out what's going on? </p> <p>\u0095 Try joking and staying (on the surface at least) cool about nasty remarks. </p> <p>\u0095 Never put all your eggs in one basket. Make sure that you have other friends apart from that group. If they are acting like that, maybe they are not worth bothering with at the moment. </p> <p>\u0095 Concentrate on filling your time with things you like to do. </p> <p>\u0095 Suppose that it is someone else in your group getting the cold shoulder - what would you do to be a good friend to them?</p>",

      "bodyText": "You got the IQ of a digeridoo You look insane like you got no brain You got a big fat belly like a bowl full of jelly Your fat mum Milly looks like Free Willy Ooh stick you Your Mama too And your Daddy These lyrics are not the dernier cri in gangsta rap, but from the current chart hit, \"Ooh stick you\" by two 16-year-old girls from New Jersey, Daphne and Celeste, who take it in turns to chant insults at each other. If you find them worryingly \"in your face\", perhaps you should put it down to a sense of humour failure. But as every woman knows, female friendships are often no laughing matter. Lily Fraser was in year 1 at her mixed north London primary school when she started coming home in a bad mood, saying she had had a horrible time. There would often be tears at bedtime. Lily had been in what her mother, Liz, thought was the enviable position of having three best friends. However, they made new best friends. Lily was bereft. \"By year 2 things got really difficult,\" Liz explains. \"The pattern of one-to-one friendships Lily understood expanded to playing complicated role-play games. Lily would complain about the others not wanting to play her versions, and it was only after prompting that I realised how convoluted the protocol was,\" Liz says. \"Someone would have ownership of the game and decide who was going to be what. To be elected as the big brother or the mother was grossly insulting. If Lily couldn't be what she wanted she'd get upset, but that got her nowhere. \" Liz realises with hindsight that the unhappy times in the playground may have lasted only a few minutes, but that they were what Lily remembered. Now she and her classmates are reaching the grand old age of seven, they are more relaxed and compromise more, although she can still come home upset. \"I think she has a really good network of friends, but she doesn't always see it like that. If she has a big falling out with one of them occasionally, she'll still say 'nobody at school likes me' or 'I've been left out'. You have to have quite roundabout conversations to find out that this means they are not playing the game the way she wants to. She is the oldest of two, and a lot of it is about accepting that things can't always go her way.\" If the pressure of playground life in a mixed school seems intense, what happens when there are no boys to leaven the mix? Jenny Walwyn has three daughters, all at private, single-sex schools in London.

For hard-pressed schools now finalising their budgets and spending plans for the next financial year, that means being able to pluck some extra items from their wish lists.

Her school is a small, one-form entry primary school with a nursery class, which currently has 208 pupils on the roll.</p> <p>\"There are lots of things we would like to do, including extending our resource base - and particularly investing in new computers - and improving the school buildings,\" she said. \"But our main priority will be to get more part-time teaching help to benefit the 20% of our pupils who need targeted support and extra help with basic skills such as numeracy and literacy.\" </p> <p>Susan Springford, head of Parsloes primary school in Dagenham, Essex, explained her imaginative plans to make more constructive use of the lunchtime break, training the school's so-called dinner ladies to do more than simply supervise the younger children's eating. \"It's like a concrete jungle here,\" she said of the school, which has 438 pupils. \"The kids have very little to do at lunchtime, apart from play football and use skipping ropes. I would like our dinner ladies to have a broader educational role and become more involved in the school, helping the younger children with games and reading.\" </p> <p>Paul Barraclough, head of Glebelands primary school in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, said he expected to receive around \u00a39,000 for his 280-pupil school. \"Our immediate priorities will be to buy books and equipment, because like many schools we are increasingly reliant on our parent-teacher association to help us out with these things through fund-raising events. In particular, we need books to support literacy, numeracy and ICT teaching. More computer equipment would also be useful, as we have only one computer per classroom at the moment.\" </p> <p>City technology colleges and specialist schools may not be perceived as cash-strapped compared with many other state comprehensives. At the top-performing Thomas Telford school in Shropshire, headteacher Kevin Satchwell said he would like to use the money to expand its partnership projects with the local community. At the top of the list is a pioneering mathematics project run in conjunction with three local feeder primary schools, which send some of their year 6 pupils to the comprehensive for \"master classes\" in maths.</p> <p>All three schools use white-board technology, which taps into Thomas Telford's teaching resources, and their own maths teachers receive extra training from those at Thomas Telford. \"We would very much like to add another school or two to this programme,\" a school spokeswoman said. \"A recent Ofsted inspection found that the additional emphasis on maths prepared children very effectively for their transition to secondary school.\" </p> <p>David James, head of Uplands Community College in Wadhurst, on the Sussex and Kent borders, has 1,000 pupils at his mixed comprehensive, which would make him eligible for \u00a340,000. He has imaginative plans to use the money to free his \"middle management\" teachers for at least an hour a week in order to concentrate on the new system of performance management used to assess staff for performance-related pay. \"An extra hour a week is the equivalent of \u00a31,400 for every member of staff,\" James said. \"All these changes in education are putting a great deal of pressure on middle management in particular\". </p> <p>New language laboratory facilities are also on his wish list. The school was the beneficiary last year of a \u00a320,000 cash prize in the first round of the Teaching Awards, after its maths teacher, Romilda Scannelli, was named Secondary Teacher of the Year. As well as establishing an annual school prize, the money is also being used to improve student facilities. </p> <p>George Wiskin, head of Westwood School, Leek in Staffordshire, a mixed 13-plus comprehensive with 850 pupils (including a 280-strong sixth form) said he also expected to receive around \u00a340,000. \"This is a very welcome addition to our budget,\" he commented.</p> <p>\"We expect to spend it on extra books and other resource material for our pupils, as well as offsetting the rising costs of exam fees. We have already pencilled in \u00a375,000 for books and \u00a350,000 for exam fees for this year, and things are pretty tight. Set textbooks are always needed. And the school has around 40 students studying for A-level history, for which good-quality books between \u00a310 and \u00a325 are also essential. The money for books will be allocated to individual departments, at \u00a3200 to \u00a3500 each.

For years, our building was our biggest headache but we have now reached an agreement with the local authority to sort that out.

      "body": "<p>It's a hot March morning in Charlotte, North Carolina, but Ann Clark is keeping her cool despite the worry of an earlier highway pile-up involving two of her pupils.</p> <p>Even by US standards of sprawling state schools (known as \"public\" schools in the US), Clark's job is a daunting one. She is in overall charge of four newly built schools on a single campus, with more than 6,500 children aged five to 18 in her care. And as well as being principal of one of them - Vance High School - she also helped to set them up just four years ago. The \"governors' village\" schools - named after former North Carolina state governors - are also pioneering an innovative programme of local educational reform where technology plays a key role. </p> <p>The schools consist of Vance High along with a middle school and two elementary schools. Together they offer the so-called K-12 educational programme, which covers the entire school age range from those at kindergarten, aged five, through to 12th graders aged 17 and 18. The schools attract a broad ethnic and social mix, drawing their intake from poor local housing estates as well as more prosperous suburbs. </p> <p>Visitors from all over the world have come to find out what they can learn from this unique educational test-bed. Even before they were opened, the schools were the first in the world to receive funding from the technology giant IBM, under a new education programme. IBM, a big local employer, awarded the school a $2m (\u00a31.3m) grant in the first round of its \"reinventing education\" scheme to help put its classrooms at the cutting edge of new technology. </p> <p>Now, although the funding is almost spent, the partnership will continue in the form of ongoing support. Since the award to Charlotte in 1994, IBM has subsequently awarded grants of this kind to 21 other US states. Global investment has followed, with schemes in Dublin, Brazil, Italy and Vietnam; more will soon be announced in Singapore and Australia. </p> <p>Next month it will introduce the programme, which incorporates revolutionary new software called Wired for Learning, to Britain. IBM is putting $1m - to be matched by an equivalent sum from the education department - into 50 beacon schools, which are designed to spread good practice and innovation. In the first step, the heads of beacon schools attended a workshop yesterday. </p> <p>Free internet access in the US has put the web at the heart of the classroom, and at the governors' schools children are taught how to surf the net while still at elementary school. Now, Britain is hoping to learn from the experience of the Charlotte schools, and to benefit from reduced internet charges, which have previously restricted its use in the classroom. </p> <p>Clark says that although it is still too early to claim that Wired for Learning has helped to raise student achievement, it has undoubtedly improved teachers' approaches by helping with lesson planning and communication. And, crucially, it has fostered better communication between parents, teachers, pupils and members of the community. </p> <p>Wired for Learning was developed as a result of close collaboration between IBM and the Charlotte teachers, and tailor-made for the schools' own use. It combines the power of the internet with the security of Lotus Notes to allow the delivery of information through the web for teaching purposes, while also allowing confidential communication via email. </p> <p>Using the technology to get busy, working parents more involved in their children's schooling has been a priority. Parents are encouraged to communicate with the school via email, and to look at the teachers' websites where details of lesson plans and homework assignments are posted. </p> <p>For Clark, there are downsides. On a typical day, she will receive a staggering 300 email messages, around half of them from parents. She will try to answer all of them. </p> <p>Teachers are also able to develop lesson plans, tapping into a database to ensure that they meet performance standards, and subsequently mapping and monitoring pupil progress throughout their school careers. </p> <p>Pupils can use the programme to work on their school assignments both in and outside the classroom. </p> <p>The regular use of the internet for schoolwork means that parents must sign a consent form for their child to surf \"acceptable\" sites. Vance High's technology director, Jim Storch, says that a minority of parents decline to do so, mainly on religious grounds.

      "bodyText": "It's a hot March morning in Charlotte, North Carolina, but Ann Clark is keeping her cool despite the worry of an earlier highway pile-up involving two of her pupils. Even by US standards of sprawling state schools (known as \"public\" schools in the US), Clark's job is a daunting one. She is in overall charge of four newly built schools on a single campus, with more than 6,500 children aged five to 18 in her care. And as well as being principal of one of them - Vance High School - she also helped to set them up just four years ago. The \"governors' village\" schools - named after former North Carolina state governors - are also pioneering an innovative programme of local educational reform where technology plays a key role. The schools consist of Vance High along with a middle school and two elementary schools. Together they offer the so-called K-12 educational programme, which covers the entire school age range from those at kindergarten, aged five, through to 12th graders aged 17 and 18. The schools attract a broad ethnic and social mix, drawing their intake from poor local housing estates as well as more prosperous suburbs. Visitors from all over the world have come to find out what they can learn from this unique educational test-bed. Even before they were opened, the schools were the first in the world to receive funding from the technology giant IBM, under a new education programme. IBM, a big local employer, awarded the school a $2m (\u00a31.3m) grant in the first round of its \"reinventing education\" scheme to help put its classrooms at the cutting edge of new technology. Now, although the funding is almost spent, the partnership will continue in the form of ongoing support. Since the award to Charlotte in 1994, IBM has subsequently awarded grants of this kind to 21 other US states. Global investment has followed, with schemes in Dublin, Brazil, Italy and Vietnam; more will soon be announced in Singapore and Australia. Next month it will introduce the programme, which incorporates revolutionary new software called Wired for Learning, to Britain. IBM is putting $1m - to be matched by an equivalent sum from the education department - into 50 beacon schools, which are designed to spread good practice and innovation. In the first step, the heads of beacon schools attended a workshop yesterday. Free internet access in the US has put the web at the heart of the classroom, and at the governors' schools children are taught how to surf the net while still at elementary school. Now, Britain is hoping to learn from the experience of the Charlotte schools, and to benefit from reduced internet charges, which have previously restricted its use in the classroom. Clark says that although it is still too early to claim that Wired for Learning has helped to raise student achievement, it has undoubtedly improved teachers' approaches by helping with lesson planning and communication. And, crucially, it has fostered better communication between parents, teachers, pupils and members of the community. Wired for Learning was developed as a result of close collaboration between IBM and the Charlotte teachers, and tailor-made for the schools' own use. It combines the power of the internet with the security of Lotus Notes to allow the delivery of information through the web for teaching purposes, while also allowing confidential communication via email. Using the technology to get busy, working parents more involved in their children's schooling has been a priority. Parents are encouraged to communicate with the school via email, and to look at the teachers' websites where details of lesson plans and homework assignments are posted. For Clark, there are downsides. On a typical day, she will receive a staggering 300 email messages, around half of them from parents. She will try to answer all of them. Teachers are also able to develop lesson plans, tapping into a database to ensure that they meet performance standards, and subsequently mapping and monitoring pupil progress throughout their school careers. Pupils can use the programme to work on their school assignments both in and outside the classroom. The regular use of the internet for schoolwork means that parents must sign a consent form for their child to surf \"acceptable\" sites. Vance High's technology director, Jim Storch, says that a minority of parents decline to do so, mainly on religious grounds. The schools have on average one computer for every four pupils, as well as extensive facilities in their libraries. Raising standards is undoubtedly key to the longer-term agenda. North Carolina has a poor academic record, languishing in the bottom 10 of all American states in terms of school performance. Education chiefs accepted the need for innovative changes to raise standards, which coincided with the need to open more schools to cope with the fast-growing local population. Clark, who in 1994 was awarded the prestigious national accolade of principal of the year in her previous job, was hired to oversee the setting-up of the new schools. IBM's new technology has been key to achieving what she describes as a \"seamless, multi-disciplinary, instructional process\". In a nutshell, this has meant abandoning traditional age-grade schooling, instead allowing pupils to move in and out of groups as they master skills, concepts and knowledge. Over at the Nathaniel Alexander elementary school, principal Nancy Hicks explains how modern teaching must recognise the need for new skills such as sifting and evaluating information on the internet. Pupils are often computer-literate when they arrive at her school, where there are 1,100 youngsters. \"We have five-year-olds starting here who are used to using email,\" she explains.

      "body": "<p>Cambridge University's efforts to provide more grants for hard-up students are being thwarted by government regulations designed to claw back money from poor students on bursaries. </p> <p>The university is stepping up its campaign to generate bursary funds from endowments, alumni contributions, charities and companies, amid growing fears that the spectre of rising debts is deterring poor students from applying to university. However, rules forcing students to start paying tuition fees when they receive over \u00a31,800 in bursaries and grants are proving a major obstacle. </p> <p>This week, the Cambridge colleges are unveiling a comprehensive support scheme for needy students, with up to \u00a3900 awarded to every Cambridge student fully or partly exempt from government tuition fees. In the current academic year, the university will channel \u00a31m into access bursaries for over 1,200 students. </p> <p>The aim is to double the number of students getting support over the next three years, and increase the value of the awards. About a fifth of Cambridge freshers come from low-income backgrounds, according to the official admissions figures. The drive is part of a push to widen access and attract talented students, irrespective of background. </p> <p>But many dons believe the task is being made difficult by the government's decision to scrap maintenance grants and charge tuition fees, which they feel is alienating some students from university. Two weeks ago we revealed complaints from leading academics that the rules fly in the face of efforts to widen access to universities, and will create a new poverty trap for cash-strapped students. Department for Education officials have now said the regulations are under review but will not be changed until the 2001-02 academic year. </p> <p>Capping of bursaries is seen as a large hindrance to the access drive. The government's student support regulations state students can receive \u00a3820 of income of any description, and \u00a31,000 of any bursary, before they must start paying fees. </p> <p>\"If bursary income is to be capped at such a low level, it is a major disincentive to raising the necessary funds to help the people who really need help the most,\" said Dr Gordon Johnson, chair of the Cambridge colleges. He said there were many cases where the university would want to offer financial support above \u00a31,800 to help students through university. </p> <p>Baroness O'Neill, president of Cambridge's Newnham College, fears the regulations will deter companies from offering industrial sponsorships, particularly for students on engineering and science courses. </p> <p>Last week officials at the DfEE stressed that they had not intended bursaries to be used for tuition fees, and the regulations were under review. \"We know some colleges want to offer higher bursaries to disadvantaged students. The best way for institutions to contribute to the government's agenda to widen participation would be to offer bursaries at the existing level to as many students as possible,\" said one official. </p> <p>\"It is not our intention that any student from a low-income family be asked to use their bursary to contribute to tuition fees. For this reason we are reviewing the way bursaries affect the individual and family income assessment in preparation for the new regulations for 2001-02.\" </p> <p>The government is also monitoring students' financial situation through two major surveys - the student income and expenditure review, and the review of access funds and hardship loans in universities.</p> <p>\u0095 Dr Lee Elliot Major is deputy editor of Research Fortnight.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cambridge University's efforts to provide more grants for hard-up students are being thwarted by government regulations designed to claw back money from poor students on bursaries. The university is stepping up its campaign to generate bursary funds from endowments, alumni contributions, charities and companies, amid growing fears that the spectre of rising debts is deterring poor students from applying to university. However, rules forcing students to start paying tuition fees when they receive over \u00a31,800 in bursaries and grants are proving a major obstacle. This week, the Cambridge colleges are unveiling a comprehensive support scheme for needy students, with up to \u00a3900 awarded to every Cambridge student fully or partly exempt from government tuition fees. In the current academic year, the university will channel \u00a31m into access bursaries for over 1,200 students. The aim is to double the number of students getting support over the next three years, and increase the value of the awards. About a fifth of Cambridge freshers come from low-income backgrounds, according to the official admissions figures. The drive is part of a push to widen access and attract talented students, irrespective of background. But many dons believe the task is being made difficult by the government's decision to scrap maintenance grants and charge tuition fees, which they feel is alienating some students from university. Two weeks ago we revealed complaints from leading academics that the rules fly in the face of efforts to widen access to universities, and will create a new poverty trap for cash-strapped students. Department for Education officials have now said the regulations are under review but will not be changed until the 2001-02 academic year. Capping of bursaries is seen as a large hindrance to the access drive. The government's student support regulations state students can receive \u00a3820 of income of any description, and \u00a31,000 of any bursary, before they must start paying fees. \"If bursary income is to be capped at such a low level, it is a major disincentive to raising the necessary funds to help the people who really need help the most,\" said Dr Gordon Johnson, chair of the Cambridge colleges. He said there were many cases where the university would want to offer financial support above \u00a31,800 to help students through university. Baroness O'Neill, president of Cambridge's Newnham College, fears the regulations will deter companies from offering industrial sponsorships, particularly for students on engineering and science courses. Last week officials at the DfEE stressed that they had not intended bursaries to be used for tuition fees, and the regulations were under review. \"We know some colleges want to offer higher bursaries to disadvantaged students. The best way for institutions to contribute to the government's agenda to widen participation would be to offer bursaries at the existing level to as many students as possible,\" said one official. \"It is not our intention that any student from a low-income family be asked to use their bursary to contribute to tuition fees. For this reason we are reviewing the way bursaries affect the individual and family income assessment in preparation for the new regulations for 2001-02.\" The government is also monitoring students' financial situation through two major surveys - the student income and expenditure review, and the review of access funds and hardship loans in universities. \u0095 Dr Lee Elliot Major is deputy editor of Research Fortnight.",

The House of Commons science and technology committee has asked the government to explain its decision. In developing a new science and innovation policy, the government has heard many good arguments for creating a regional strategy. The government's contention that research will underpin the knowledge-based companies of the future, coupled with its vows to promote economic rejuvenation in the regions, points to a more equitable distribution of research funds. And devolution for Scotland and Wales has highlighted further the needs of the English regions. There are some difficult issues to reconcile. Each regional economic plan contained the same priorities - exploitation of research, university-business links, high-tech business clusters. Can all the regions do all these things? University researchers in the south-east attract more research funds, and are more highly rated than their academic colleagues in the midlands and the north, according to figures recently compiled by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Should there be a redistribution of resources? Some hints of the government's regional policy may emerge when Byers unveils the details of the regional innovation fund. More substantial proposals are expected in the summer, when the government publishes its new science strategy. But most believe that the funding package for the north-west announced this month has been waved through without considering these wider issues. Political expediency won the day.",

      "bodyText": "Counsel to the Bloody Sunday inquiry yesterday started with what is expected to prove the longest opening address in United Kingdom legal history, vowing to uncover the truth \"pure and simple\" about one of the most notorious episodes of the troubles. Christopher Clarke QC, beginning the oral hearings, promised his team was committed to finding out what led the army to open fire on an anti-internment march in Londonderry 28 years ago. His determination was absolute, he said, and witnesses would be tackled without fear or favour. Members of the First Battalion of the Parachute Regiment shot dead 13 unarmed Catholics on the illegal parade. One of the 14 people wounded died five months later. Mr Clarke, at the Guildhall in Londonderry, said: \"What happened on January 30 1972 was, whatever the truth of the matter, a tragedy, the pain of which has endured despite the passage of years. It was and it remains of serious concern.\" Mr Clarke admitted there had been problems in gathering evidence. The inquiry has been amassing documents for two years, and is expected to go on for at least two more years, making it the longest such tribunal ever. Mr Clarke said: \"There are those who have chosen to regard the task of the inquiry as impossible. It is not so. \"But what is true is the ability of the inquiry to get to the truth is dependent on two things: first, the extent and quality of the evidence available to it and secondly, the assistance that is provided to it. There are those who see through the distorted prism of guilt or anger, prejudice or predisposition.\" He said the understandable urgency in the aftermath of Bloody Sunday led to the failure of the lord chief justice, Lord Widgery, to find out what had happened. His report, accepted by Edward Heath's government as vindication of the army, had engendered resentment which had lasted until now, and not just among the families of those who died. Lord Widgery held hearings over 21 days. He delivered his 36-page report within three months, declaring the army had started shooting only after coming under gunfire, a finding furiously disputed by the bereaved and survivors. Mr Clarke said in contrast 1,400 witnesses had so far been interviewed for Lord Saville's inquiry. The search for evidence had taken the inquiry team from Nevada in the United States to Hong Kong and had included every continent except Antarctica. Although he recognised witnesses' memories may be failing, he hoped the passage of time would encourage frankness. He believed it would allow some now to face up to unpalatable truths. Mr Clarke said: \"Truth has a life of its own. Although the first casualty of hostilities, it has formidable powers of recovery, even after such a long interval.\" Several figures, including Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, who then led the IRA in Londonderry, have yet to provide statements. He said as he arrived at the Guildhall yesterday he would do so if he became convinced Lord Saville's inquiry was open and impartial. Mr Clarke warned he would use the powers of subpoena if witnesses refused to give evidence. All would be treated equally no matter what their power or influence. He pointed out witnesses had immunity from prosecution. None could face criminal action as a result of appearing before Lord Saville, except for committing perjury. Mr Clarke described the discrimination faced by Catholics in Londonderry in the run-up to Bloody Sunday, daily battles between security forces and local youths, and secret army documents highlighting military fears they were losing control in Londonderry. The inquiry continues today. Who, what, where - and how much? The judges The inquiry in the city's Guildhall is chaired by Lord Saville of Newdigate, an English law lord who usually sits in the court of appeal. Married with two sons, Lord Saville previously chaired a Department of Trade and Industry committee into arbitration, the findings of which were encompassed into the 1996 Arbitration Act. He is joined by the former New Zealand judge Sir Edward Somers, a judge in New Zealand's court of appeal from 1981 until 1990, and Canadian William Hoyt, who for 14 years was a court of appeal judge in New Brunswick. The court Technology is being used as never before. Each member of the Saville panel and every lawyer and official has a computer screen in front of him to study the thousands of documents which will be presented to the inquiry. Proceedings will be published on the internet daily. A virtual reality recreation of the Bogside will allow witnesses to mark positions on a large screen. They will, said one insider, be able to \"walk\" down the streets. It is expected to be at least a year before any soldiers are called to give evidence, with the inquiry chamber booked for two years. The cost The cost is \u00a314m so far, and could reach \u00a3100m. In the two years since the inquiry was set up 1,500 statements have been taken from witnesses.

      "body": "<p>J\u00f6rg Haider's retreat to Carinthia after his resignation as national leader of the far-right Freedom party may have pleased most Austrians but it it is worrying artists, musicians and writers in the region.</p> <p>Mr Haider, who remains governor of Carinthia, has appointed himself the province's cultural supremo. Artists fear that emboldened rightwingers will repress experimental art by withdrawing state funding for artists who criticise them.</p> <p>Mr Haider's plan, which he has said he wants to expand nationwide, involves a radical shift from state support for the arts to private sponsorship, which has little precedent in Austria. Art critics fear this would mean that critical voices were silenced.</p> <p>\"Community brass bands and art celebrating beauty and harmony, the land and the people, blood and soil will have the upper hand over fringe theatre groups whose critical art alienates the man on the street,\" one said.</p> <p>The Freedom party, whose inclusion in the coalition government has earned Austria its current status as international pariah, has already been accused of targeting the cultural avant garde and \"degenerate\" art for cuts in an attempt to silence some of its most powerful critics.</p> <p>\"Artists don't know where they stand,\" Uschi Loigge, the cultural editor of the Carinthian daily Kleine Zeitung, says. \"Haider has only ever criticised them for being spongers and lazy leftwing intellectuals. He uses every public appearance to promote traditional culture like yodelling and to denounce the modern. And he's sure of getting applause every time.\"</p> <p>But the real focus of the artists' wrath is Andreas M\u00f6lzer, Haider's cultural adviser, an extreme rightwinger who outlined his ideals in tracts published 20 years ago.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian he has admitted he will make a lot of unpopular decisions as cultural adviser with the aims of \"curbing pluralism\" and \"bringing Carinthians back to their roots\".</p> <p>\"I don't have political responsibility and that's the beauty of it,\" he says. \"Someone has to play the crocodile and for that I'm paid a princely sum.\"</p> <p>Mr M\u00f6lzer, 54, is editor-in-chief of Zur Zeit, a national weekly which he founded and which even he admits gives space to \"the loony right\". He is currently facing charges of \"attempting to resurrect the Third Reich\" - a criminal offence in Austria - for an anti-semitic article he printed.</p> <p>Mr M\u00f6lzer, whose allegiance to the far right is symbolised by a schmiss - a fencing scar running from jaw to nose which is recognised as a \"badge of manhood\" among male student fraternities - wrote a book about the students' wing of the Waffen SS in which he said: \"The first aim of our fight should be the reawakening of a strong German cultural and spiritual consciousness.\"</p> <p>Twenty years on, Mr M\u00f6lzer stands by all he wrote although he says it was written \"when the political correctness mechanism wasn't in place\". He believes that for years \"left- wing intellectuals have been helping themselves to the spoils and that won't happen any more\".</p> <p>Under a pseudonym, he writes a weekly column in Austria's most popular tabloid which he uses to outline his plans to \"repatriate Carinthia through art and culture\" and to denounce outspoken artists.</p> <p>One of the leftwingers he likes to target is Bella Ban, who owns Cafe OM in Pernhart Strasse in Klagenfurt, close to the Hotel Sandwirt, from where in 1938 Hitler addressed an adoring crowd.</p> <p>In the past 10 days she has been forced to make two changes to the way she runs her business: she vets each customer before unlocking her door and she's stopped cleaning the huge front window.</p> <p>The reason is a large transparent screen print stretching the full height of the glass, depicting the cabinet members of Austria's government distorted with Hitler haircuts and moustaches. Mr Haider's face is covered in swastikas.</p> <p>The window artwork by Carinthias's most famous dadaist, Viktor Rogy, has transformed Ms Ban's cafe into a focal point for supporters and opponents of Mr Haider.</p> <p>\"Old people rap on the window with their walking sticks and lots of others have spat in protest,\" says Ms Ban.</p> <p>Mr Rogy, 75, who sports a thin Hitler moustache with irreverent irony, has ordered her not to wash the saliva off. \"They've turned my art into a spitting altar, and they're adding more value to it because they're spitting on their own government,\" he says.</p> <p>So far the police have called twice and the city authorities have even threatened to close the cafe down and take the couple to court for attempting to resurrect the Third Reich.</p> <p>\"This attempt from certain quarters to show our country in such a morbid light must be stopped as fast as possible,\" a spokeman for the Freedom party said. \"Art has its limits.\"</p> <p>Another target is Cornelius Kolig, a Carinthian artist who was commissioned to add frescos to a room in the state parliament building 18 months ago. Mr Kolig's grandfather had painted frescos in the building but they were condemned as degenerate by the Nazis and destroyed.</p> <p>Mr M\u00f6lzer says commissioning Mr Kolig was a \"bad decision\" and derided his work as \"faecal\".</p> <p>The Freedom party also criticises Klagenfurt's civic theatre which they complain is disrepectful towards the German language by bringing in international artists and staging bilingual productions.</p> <p>The theatre's artistic director, Dietmar Pflegerl, recently won a long battle with Mr M\u00f6lzer, who was threatening to slash his budget until Mr Haider intervened at the last minute. Mr Pflegerl is convinced the two are \"playing a game, to see how far they can go\".</p> <p>Mr M\u00f6lzer's ire was roused last year by a play by one of the Freedom party's staunchest enemies, Elfriede Jelinek, about the attempts to isolate non-German speakers in Austria.</p> <p>Mr Pfegerl expects this year's programme, which includes two plays by Carinthian authors that deal candidly with Austria's recent history, will cause even more anger.</p> <p>\"This is a time when Austria has to deal with its ghosts like at no other time before,\" he says. \"But M\u00f6lzer's pushing for artists to plug the image of our cosy homeland and wants to ban anything foreign or critical.\"</p> <p>The theatre's press spokesman, Stefan Zoltan, is even wary when using his mobile telephone these days. \"The atmosphere has changed. You have the feeling that you are being watched all the time.</p> <p>\"I hear things I've said to people in private being repeated, even in M\u00f6lzer's newspaper columns. I'm sure there are many informers out there who report back to the chief what's going on.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "J\u00f6rg Haider's retreat to Carinthia after his resignation as national leader of the far-right Freedom party may have pleased most Austrians but it it is worrying artists, musicians and writers in the region. Mr Haider, who remains governor of Carinthia, has appointed himself the province's cultural supremo. Artists fear that emboldened rightwingers will repress experimental art by withdrawing state funding for artists who criticise them. Mr Haider's plan, which he has said he wants to expand nationwide, involves a radical shift from state support for the arts to private sponsorship, which has little precedent in Austria. Art critics fear this would mean that critical voices were silenced. \"Community brass bands and art celebrating beauty and harmony, the land and the people, blood and soil will have the upper hand over fringe theatre groups whose critical art alienates the man on the street,\" one said. The Freedom party, whose inclusion in the coalition government has earned Austria its current status as international pariah, has already been accused of targeting the cultural avant garde and \"degenerate\" art for cuts in an attempt to silence some of its most powerful critics. \"Artists don't know where they stand,\" Uschi Loigge, the cultural editor of the Carinthian daily Kleine Zeitung, says. \"Haider has only ever criticised them for being spongers and lazy leftwing intellectuals. He uses every public appearance to promote traditional culture like yodelling and to denounce the modern. And he's sure of getting applause every time.\" But the real focus of the artists' wrath is Andreas M\u00f6lzer, Haider's cultural adviser, an extreme rightwinger who outlined his ideals in tracts published 20 years ago. In an interview with the Guardian he has admitted he will make a lot of unpopular decisions as cultural adviser with the aims of \"curbing pluralism\" and \"bringing Carinthians back to their roots\". \"I don't have political responsibility and that's the beauty of it,\" he says. \"Someone has to play the crocodile and for that I'm paid a princely sum.\" Mr M\u00f6lzer, 54, is editor-in-chief of Zur Zeit, a national weekly which he founded and which even he admits gives space to \"the loony right\". He is currently facing charges of \"attempting to resurrect the Third Reich\" - a criminal offence in Austria - for an anti-semitic article he printed. Mr M\u00f6lzer, whose allegiance to the far right is symbolised by a schmiss - a fencing scar running from jaw to nose which is recognised as a \"badge of manhood\" among male student fraternities - wrote a book about the students' wing of the Waffen SS in which he said: \"The first aim of our fight should be the reawakening of a strong German cultural and spiritual consciousness.\" Twenty years on, Mr M\u00f6lzer stands by all he wrote although he says it was written \"when the political correctness mechanism wasn't in place\". He believes that for years \"left- wing intellectuals have been helping themselves to the spoils and that won't happen any more\". Under a pseudonym, he writes a weekly column in Austria's most popular tabloid which he uses to outline his plans to \"repatriate Carinthia through art and culture\" and to denounce outspoken artists. One of the leftwingers he likes to target is Bella Ban, who owns Cafe OM in Pernhart Strasse in Klagenfurt, close to the Hotel Sandwirt, from where in 1938 Hitler addressed an adoring crowd. In the past 10 days she has been forced to make two changes to the way she runs her business: she vets each customer before unlocking her door and she's stopped cleaning the huge front window. The reason is a large transparent screen print stretching the full height of the glass, depicting the cabinet members of Austria's government distorted with Hitler haircuts and moustaches. Mr Haider's face is covered in swastikas. The window artwork by Carinthias's most famous dadaist, Viktor Rogy, has transformed Ms Ban's cafe into a focal point for supporters and opponents of Mr Haider. \"Old people rap on the window with their walking sticks and lots of others have spat in protest,\" says Ms Ban. Mr Rogy, 75, who sports a thin Hitler moustache with irreverent irony, has ordered her not to wash the saliva off. \"They've turned my art into a spitting altar, and they're adding more value to it because they're spitting on their own government,\" he says. So far the police have called twice and the city authorities have even threatened to close the cafe down and take the couple to court for attempting to resurrect the Third Reich. \"This attempt from certain quarters to show our country in such a morbid light must be stopped as fast as possible,\" a spokeman for the Freedom party said. \"Art has its limits.\" Another target is Cornelius Kolig, a Carinthian artist who was commissioned to add frescos to a room in the state parliament building 18 months ago. Mr Kolig's grandfather had painted frescos in the building but they were condemned as degenerate by the Nazis and destroyed. Mr M\u00f6lzer says commissioning Mr Kolig was a \"bad decision\" and derided his work as \"faecal\". The Freedom party also criticises Klagenfurt's civic theatre which they complain is disrepectful towards the German language by bringing in international artists and staging bilingual productions. The theatre's artistic director, Dietmar Pflegerl, recently won a long battle with Mr M\u00f6lzer, who was threatening to slash his budget until Mr Haider intervened at the last minute. Mr Pflegerl is convinced the two are \"playing a game, to see how far they can go\". Mr M\u00f6lzer's ire was roused last year by a play by one of the Freedom party's staunchest enemies, Elfriede Jelinek, about the attempts to isolate non-German speakers in Austria. Mr Pfegerl expects this year's programme, which includes two plays by Carinthian authors that deal candidly with Austria's recent history, will cause even more anger. \"This is a time when Austria has to deal with its ghosts like at no other time before,\" he says. \"But M\u00f6lzer's pushing for artists to plug the image of our cosy homeland and wants to ban anything foreign or critical.\" The theatre's press spokesman, Stefan Zoltan, is even wary when using his mobile telephone these days. \"The atmosphere has changed. You have the feeling that you are being watched all the time. \"I hear things I've said to people in private being repeated, even in M\u00f6lzer's newspaper columns. I'm sure there are many informers out there who report back to the chief what's going on.\"",

Mr Mugabe demonstrated his contempt for constitutional limits last week by ordering police to ignore a Harare high court ruling ending the government-organised, illegal occupation of 700 white-owned farms.

The same jury awarded the couple $1.7m in compensation last week after finding that the companies deceived the public about the dangers of smoking.</p> <p>Last week's verdict was the first in favour of a smoker who took up the habit after warnings from the US surgeon general first appeared on cigarette packets in the 1960s.</p> <p>The Whiteleys had asked the jury for $115m in punitive damages, which they said would represent 1% of the companies' combined net worth. Their lawyer said cigarette makers remain unrepentant for the harm they cause.</p> <p>Lawyers for Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds suggested punitive damages of $3.4m to $5.1m. They argued that the companies had got the message from similar lawsuits, and had demonstrated goodwill on the issue through the $206bn settlement reached in 1998 by cigarette makers and 46 states suing over health costs.</p> <p>Philip Morris will appeal if the trial judge upholds the verdict, said a company lawyer, William Ohlemeyer.</p> <p>\"Mrs Whiteley never smoked a pack of cigarettes that didn't have a health warning on it that was written by the surgeon general,\" Mr Ohlemeyer said. He said punitive damages were improper because \"the companies have made profound changes in the way they do business\".</p> <p>The jury voted 9-3, the margin needed for a verdict.</p> <p>Of the nation's five other jury verdicts in favour of individual smokers, two in Florida and one in New Jersey were overturned on appeal; an $80m verdict in Portland, Oregon, was reduced to $31m by the trial judge; and a $51m verdict against Philip Morris in San Francisco a year ago was cut in half by superior court judge John Munter, who is also presiding over Ms Whiteley's case.</p> <p>Ms Whiteley, 40, of Ojai in southern California, said she started smoking in 1972, when she was 13. She smoked Philip Morris' Marlboros and Reynolds' Camels until 1998, when she gave up shortly before doctors diagnosed small-cell lung cancer. Doctors say she is likely to die this year.</p> <p>The tobacco firms said Ms Whiteley harmed herself by her admitted use of marijuana, by smoking during pregnancy and by disregarding warnings on cigarette packages.</p> <p>But after reviewing internal industry documents, jurors found that the companies designed cigarettes negligently, then made false or misleading statements to the public and concealed information about the dangers of smoking. <br>AP</p>",

Last week's verdict was the first in favour of a smoker who took up the habit after warnings from the US surgeon general first appeared on cigarette packets in the 1960s. The Whiteleys had asked the jury for $115m in punitive damages, which they said would represent 1% of the companies' combined net worth. Their lawyer said cigarette makers remain unrepentant for the harm they cause. Lawyers for Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds suggested punitive damages of $3.4m to $5.1m. They argued that the companies had got the message from similar lawsuits, and had demonstrated goodwill on the issue through the $206bn settlement reached in 1998 by cigarette makers and 46 states suing over health costs. Philip Morris will appeal if the trial judge upholds the verdict, said a company lawyer, William Ohlemeyer. \"Mrs Whiteley never smoked a pack of cigarettes that didn't have a health warning on it that was written by the surgeon general,\" Mr Ohlemeyer said. He said punitive damages were improper because \"the companies have made profound changes in the way they do business\". The jury voted 9-3, the margin needed for a verdict. Of the nation's five other jury verdicts in favour of individual smokers, two in Florida and one in New Jersey were overturned on appeal; an $80m verdict in Portland, Oregon, was reduced to $31m by the trial judge; and a $51m verdict against Philip Morris in San Francisco a year ago was cut in half by superior court judge John Munter, who is also presiding over Ms Whiteley's case. Ms Whiteley, 40, of Ojai in southern California, said she started smoking in 1972, when she was 13. She smoked Philip Morris' Marlboros and Reynolds' Camels until 1998, when she gave up shortly before doctors diagnosed small-cell lung cancer. Doctors say she is likely to die this year. The tobacco firms said Ms Whiteley harmed herself by her admitted use of marijuana, by smoking during pregnancy and by disregarding warnings on cigarette packages. But after reviewing internal industry documents, jurors found that the companies designed cigarettes negligently, then made false or misleading statements to the public and concealed information about the dangers of smoking.

She is joined by Chris Ryan, a former fisherman, who is appalled by the impact of the newcomers on Dover. \"We're trying to do something for the residents and we get called racist,\" says Mrs Farrell.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why. Mrs Farrell, together with a teacher, was behind a leaflet called Dover the Land of Plenty and subtitled \"refugees, 33 reasons why we should send them back and close the door\".</p> <p>Reason number nine claims that the local hospital has advised that should anyone have \"any blood contact with these people, then medical help is of the utmost importance\". Reason number 13 reads: \"Pregnant refugee mothers only want brand new equipment for their new offspring. Are these infants now entitled to hold a British passport to success now that they have been born in our local hospitals?\"</p> <p>Reason number 21 reads: \"No medical checks on refugees, with the knowledge of their promiscuity and selling sex for money, who is to answer for the epidemic of venereal disease that will undoubtedly become rife.\"</p> <p>It would be wrong to dismiss Mrs Farrell as heartless. In that contradiction of Englishness, Mrs Farrell is kind to animals, and keeps a bird pool in her neat garden while disliking some human beings.</p> <p>Chris Ryan claims that only one in 10 of asylum seekers has a case. \"At the start about 90% were genuine and 10% bogus, it's the other way round now. \"People are resisting because of what they've got. They're on benefits, they're walking around with mobile phones, the latest clothes and cars. They're having the life of luxury on it. Some are sending back \u00a3500 in cash a week to Romania.\" Mrs Farrell joins in: \"They're going into travel agents and booking flights for their families. In the post office there was uproar as one man was getting \u00a3700 in cash.\"</p> <p>Requests for names and proof are unheeded.</p> <p>Last summer the tension led to clashes between gangs of local youths and asylum seekers at a funfair. Local councils managed to get a dispersal system enacted and have halved the numbers of refugees in the Dover area. While the government's strategy struggles to get off the ground, Kent's reduction in refugee numbers is credited with taking some of the heat out of the situation locally.</p> <p>New asylum seekers are still arriving. One is Pavel, 32, a Roma from the Czech Republic. He came to Britain in January with his wife, Natasha, 31, and four children. He says that twice in his homeland a skinhead gang broke into his flat and the first time, using baseball bats, chains and sticks, attacked him, his wife and their children.</p> <p>After the first attack he was in hospital for three weeks. His children were so traumatised that they required psychiatric counselling. \"They were scared of loud shouting and had nightmares,\" says Pavel.</p> <p><b> Reprisal fear</b><br></p> <p>He and his wife were attacked and humiliated in the street by skinheads, in a town he does not want to name for fear of reprisals if he is sent back. \"The main feeling we experienced was a lack of basic dignity,\" says Natasha.</p> <p>Pavel's family of six are now living in one room of a house on \u00a3188.09 a week. They flew to Britain separately and applied for asylum at Heathrow, but came to Dover where there were already family members.</p> <p>The furore over asylum seekers in sections of the press, mirroring the mood among some in Dover, has produced more than just anti-refugee rhetoric.</p> <p>Some like Farid Kohistani, 26, from Afghanistan, have been physically attacked and he says that every day he is verbally abused. \"The white tribes don't like us, we don't like them. Especially the Dover people.\" Now when he is sworn at, he swears back.</p> <p>The spikiness of this young man melts away when Farid talks about why he fled Afghanistan. He and his family were opposed to the Taliban regime. Farid himself fought against them. Within three months of the Taliban taking control of Kabul, Farid's father was murdered. His brother was killed in front of his mother and then she herself was killed. He does not know how they were killed, and he never even got to bury them.</p> <p>Farid arrived in Dover in July 1999. An uncle paid $9,000 (\u00a35,600) to an agent who got him a false Pakistani passport. From Afghanistan he flew to Moscow, from where he came to Britain in the back of a lorry. The overland journey took 33 days.</p> <p>\"I never knew what country we were in. There were 12 people in the truck. You could never feel good, you're frightened of being caught.\"</p> <p>Farid, who fears being murdered if returned to Afghanistan, was caught at Dover docks after police checked the truck. Within weeks of arriving he was attacked. Farid said: \"I was on the Folkestone road. There were three of us, and four of them. They used bad language, at this time I didn't know what they said. They attacked us. They punched me in my body. It lasted three to four minutes. Nobody helped us.\"</p> <p>Now Farid makes sure that he goes out with four or five other people at night to minimise the chances of being attacked, or losing the fight.</p> <p><b> Voucher humiliation</b><br></p> <p>He has \u00a337 worth of vouchers a week to live on and \u00a310 cash. \"When I use the vouchers in shops, it is horrible, horrible. The other shoppers stare, they look very bad. I feel humiliated. When you go to the shopping centre you are made to feel you're an animal, you're a dog.\"</p> <p>If the voucher system and the media attacks were designed to put pressure on asylum seekers to leave, then they are working. Farid said: \"When the war in Afghanistan finishes, I go back the first day. Before I was very relaxed. Now if the English use bad language, I'm ready to fight back. All asylum seekers are.\"</p> <p>Farid stays in a hostel, owned by a woman who does not want to be named. Her windows have been broken, and she was assaulted after trying to help a refugee who was being attacked.</p> <p>The hostel she runs tries to provide a family atmosphere for the mainly young asylum seekers it houses. At dinner the victims of failed geo-politics - Afghans, Iraqis and Kosovans - gather in the dining room for a vegetable curry and rice. Afghani music is playing in the background, the different nationalities take it in turns to listen to their different sounds.</p> <p>Rahim, not his real name, is one of 800 unaccompanied minors in Kent. Aged 15, he came to Britain from north Afghanistan in June last year. He soon regrets telling his story, and as we leave he follows, pleading that his real name is not used. He fears that his classmates will turn hostile if they realise he is an asylum seeker. \"I'm at college, no one knows I'm a refugee there. If my name is in your paper, I can't go to college. It's hard, someone will swear.\"</p> <p>Rahim has a one year visa to stay. \"I've seen hundreds of killings. My house was near a mosque where they were killing people. They washed the blood off afterwards.\" He last saw his parents a year ago and does not know if they are alive or dead. He arrived in the back of a lorry, and does not realise that he arrived in Dover from France.</p> <p>There is little infrastructure in place to help the refugees. Every Wednesday in a drafty hall belonging to the United Reform Church asylum seekers gather for a drop in session.</p> <p>Teenagers play table tennis and pool, children paint, adults sit and chat while volunteers help others to fill out forms for benefits.</p> <p>On Tuesdays the church hall is used for English classes, run by the Reverend Norman Setchell. \"I don't want to look back in five years time and hang our heads in shame because we haven't done enough,\" he says. \"After two-and-a-half years this is still the only daytime place asylum seekers can come to in Dover.</p> <p>\"There seems to be a feeling that the vast majority, if not all, are here on an economic bandwagon. It doesn't seem to matter that you can show statistics about 50m nomads and refugees in the world.</p> <p>\"What bothers me is the fundamental lack of compassion coupled with the lack of knowledge and awareness of where these people come from.\"</p> <p>In the church hall is community officer PC Norman Liggins. \"Everytime the press attacks asylum seekers, it doesn't help the situation on the ground. As soon as it appears in the press, feelings begin to rise, you can sense it.\"</p> <p>PC Liggins says much of the violence asylum seekers face is not reported.</p> <p>A dossier prepared by Dover against racism lists over 20 attacks in the past year. Some victims are too scared to speak even with anonymity, while others, under the dispersal system, have left the area.</p> <p>Despite the reduction in the numbers of asylum seekers, the attacks go on. Marcel Malik, 25, a Czech Roma who fled after repeated attacks by skinhead gangs, has been assaulted twice.</p> <p>\"This situation is much better than the Czech Republic, but I'm not safe here. We can go out, but we are scared.\"</p> <p>His girlfriend's mother, a Roma, was also attacked in another incident where she was kicked by a male neighbour while on the ground.</p> <p>Other incidents have seen refugees driven out of their homes and reports of numerous attacks on refugee children in the school system.</p> <p>It is a sign of the strength of feeling the issue arouses in the town. Paul Watkins, leader of the Tory group on the Labour controlled Dover district council, says that tension is still \"simmering under the surface\".</p> <p>He blames the government for not meeting the full cost leaving the council with a \u00a3400,000 shortfall.</p> <p><b> Election issue</b><br></p> <p>Conservative canvass returns for a council byelection in Castle ward show immigration as the first or second most important issue. At the next general election Mr Watkins will be the Tory candidate for the Dover and Deal constituency, which Labour's Gwyn Prosser holds with an 11,739 majority.</p> <p>Mr Watkins says: \"This will be the main local issue in parts of the constituency. It shouldn't be down to local people to fund a national problem, that in itself is one of the reasons for local tension and the government has caused that tension by not meeting the cost.\"</p> <p>Back in Mrs Farrell's garden Chris Ryan predicts that the asylum seeker issue will cost Labour the seat. He voted for them in 1997: \"I can see them losing the election on this. Mr Prosser hasn't come out and made a statement about what they are going to do. He talked about dispersal, but it's not happening.\"</p> <p>On the Folkestone road, a white resident who did not want to be named, cannot believe the hatred the asylum seekers encounter. \"The problems are overblown. A lot of those creating trouble are like sheep and listen to people who have nothing to say.</p> <p>\"People will tell you the refugees are all thieves, it's unbelievable what you hear. It makes me ashamed to be British. I think Dover has something to be ashamed of. I don't know what kind of noose we're making for ourselves.\"</p> <p><b>Asylum: the figures</b></p> <p>\u0095 Since 1997 the average wait to get a decision on an asylum application has dropped from two years to 13 months</p> <p>\u0095 In 1998 two-thirds of applicants were between 21 and 34, with less than 5% aged 50 or over; the average age was 26</p> <p>\u0095 In 1998, a total of 2,833 unaccompanied children aged 17 or under applied for asylum</p> <p>\u0095 In the 11 years from 1988 to 1998 37,700 people were given leave to remain in the UK as refugees; refusals for the same period totalled 213,100</p> <p>\u0095 Between December 1999 and February 2000, an average 825 applications a month were received from Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), and 575 applications a month from Sri Lanka</p>",

      "body": "<p>A year after the start of Nato's air strikes against Yugoslavia it is becoming fashionable to question whether Nato was right to intervene in Kosovo. Opponents of the war have seized on continuing tensions in the province to argue that nothing was achieved by Nato's action. Yet to imagine that there was any cost-free alternative to military action a year ago is to enter the realm of make-believe. The result of Nato doing nothing would have been a newly divided Europe, with much of the Balkans consigned forever to an outer darkness in which human rights count for nothing. No one who understood that danger a year ago has any reason to alter their view today.</p> <p>The present risk does not come from any doubt about the rightness of Nato intervention. It comes from the failure so far of the allies to follow through with the civilian and military resources that are needed to make it work. By the end of the war most of the infrastructure needed for any kind of civilised life had ceased to exist in Kosovo. The devastation was not only physical. Most of the institutional infrastructure had broken down as well. Police and law courts, education and health care had all been massively disrupted. The task faced by the allies when Nato ended its air campaign was not just peace-keeping. It was building the institutions of a modern civil society and state.</p> <p>Both the magnitude and the difficulties of this task have been underestimated. A massive programme of civilian aid will be required to get the province back on its feet. Yet it remains an open question whether the resources will be forthcoming on the scale that is required. The countries that managed to screw up the resolution needed to take military action - despite their genuine and in some contexts continuing differences of outlook and purpose - are finding that shouldering its consequences imposes unexpectedly heavy burdens. It is finally beginning to sink in that the allies' commitment to Kosovo cannot be a matter of months or years. On any realistic scenario it must be counted in decades.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the war, Kosovo was in a condition of anarchy. Worse, the stage was set for another round of ethnic conflict. Serbs who feared revenge attacks from Kosovo's returning Albanians have fled in large numbers. Those who remain live in an atmosphere of dread and insecurity. It is wishful thinking to expect this situation to improve greatly over the next few years. Despite the achievements of international agencies over the past nine months, Kosovo's recent history has left a climate of vendetta and mutual hatred that could last for generations.</p> <p>In these circumstances, the international community's determination that it will not abandon the goal of multi-ethnic democracy in the province may prove to be misplaced. Democratic institutions are not workable when society is divided into ethnic groups that hate and mistrust one another with the intensity of feeling that exists in Kosovo. It is not inconceivable that the price of democracy in the province will turn out to be further population transfers.</p> <p>Yet even partition - admitted or de facto - is not a risk-free solution. Any shift in policy on the part of the international community that appears to put the present, horribly fragile status quo in Kosovo into question will have knock-on effects throughout the region. The break-up of what is left of Yugoslavia would leave it desperately unstable. There is no magic wand which the international community can wave that will make the region's problems suddenly tractable.</p> <p>It is at this point that we reach the heart of the difficulty. On any short- or medium-term time-scale the problems of the region are not fully soluble. They arise from the political vacuum created by the fragmentation of the multinational Yugoslav state and the anarchy that has followed the collapse of communism in Albania. In a more extended historical perspective, they are the long-delayed aftershock of the break-up of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires in the aftermath of the first world war.</p> <p>Ultimately, the problems faced in Kosovo today come from the fact that in the Balkans the principle of national self-determination is a recipe for unending conflict. The shifting, post-imperial mosaic of peoples in the region cannot be organised in nation-states without horrendous suffering. Peace and the infrastructure of civilised life cannot be achieved in Kosovo unless the province is placed under long-term international trusteeship. Without fully realising it, the international community committed itself to some such outcome when it sanctioned Nato intervention. Whether we like it or not we are in for a very long haul.</p> <p>Building consensus on a long-term presence in Kosovo will be far from easy. Nato's member-states are all of them in some degree post-military societies. Their citizens view costly military commitments of indeterminate duration with deep suspicion. As was shown by the reaction to Mr Blair's resolute stance throughout the Kosovo war, the public can be unstinting in its support for decisive action in support of human rights. But it is notably less enthusiastic when it comes to footing the bill. Using soldiers to protect human rights in far-away countries costs money. It pre-empts resources that could be used for schools and hospitals. The reaction to the dislocated casualties of such conflicts when they turn up on London's streets suggests that public altruism is severely limited.</p> <p>Public opinion has not yet understood that protecting human rights across all of Europe will use up much of the peace dividend that came with the end of the cold war. Understandably, politicians are reluctant to press the point. There are not many votes in dwelling on the cost of coping with intractable problems. Yet if voters are not educated in the cost of peace in Europe it will not be secure. The risk is that, as public support ebbs away, the international agencies in Kosovo will be starved of the resources they need. At worst, the whole international presence could be cut back, with the Balkans drifting slowly into an unmanageable chaos.</p> <p>Nato's action was a response to the danger of a redivided Europe. If it had not intervened, Europe's Orthodox and Muslim regions would have ended up beyond the pale of civilised life, prey to ruthless tyranny and subject to gross abuses of human rights. That prospect has been averted. But it has not been removed. If the international community fails to deliver on the commitment it has made, the aftermath of the war in Kosovo may come to be remembered as the time when the redivision of Europe began.</p> <p>\u0095 John Gray is professor of European thought at the London School of Economics.</p>",

Serbs who feared revenge attacks from Kosovo's returning Albanians have fled in large numbers. Those who remain live in an atmosphere of dread and insecurity. It is wishful thinking to expect this situation to improve greatly over the next few years. Despite the achievements of international agencies over the past nine months, Kosovo's recent history has left a climate of vendetta and mutual hatred that could last for generations. In these circumstances, the international community's determination that it will not abandon the goal of multi-ethnic democracy in the province may prove to be misplaced. Democratic institutions are not workable when society is divided into ethnic groups that hate and mistrust one another with the intensity of feeling that exists in Kosovo. It is not inconceivable that the price of democracy in the province will turn out to be further population transfers. Yet even partition - admitted or de facto - is not a risk-free solution. Any shift in policy on the part of the international community that appears to put the present, horribly fragile status quo in Kosovo into question will have knock-on effects throughout the region. The break-up of what is left of Yugoslavia would leave it desperately unstable. There is no magic wand which the international community can wave that will make the region's problems suddenly tractable. It is at this point that we reach the heart of the difficulty. On any short- or medium-term time-scale the problems of the region are not fully soluble. They arise from the political vacuum created by the fragmentation of the multinational Yugoslav state and the anarchy that has followed the collapse of communism in Albania. In a more extended historical perspective, they are the long-delayed aftershock of the break-up of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires in the aftermath of the first world war. Ultimately, the problems faced in Kosovo today come from the fact that in the Balkans the principle of national self-determination is a recipe for unending conflict. The shifting, post-imperial mosaic of peoples in the region cannot be organised in nation-states without horrendous suffering. Peace and the infrastructure of civilised life cannot be achieved in Kosovo unless the province is placed under long-term international trusteeship. Without fully realising it, the international community committed itself to some such outcome when it sanctioned Nato intervention. Whether we like it or not we are in for a very long haul. Building consensus on a long-term presence in Kosovo will be far from easy. Nato's member-states are all of them in some degree post-military societies. Their citizens view costly military commitments of indeterminate duration with deep suspicion. As was shown by the reaction to Mr Blair's resolute stance throughout the Kosovo war, the public can be unstinting in its support for decisive action in support of human rights. But it is notably less enthusiastic when it comes to footing the bill. Using soldiers to protect human rights in far-away countries costs money. It pre-empts resources that could be used for schools and hospitals. The reaction to the dislocated casualties of such conflicts when they turn up on London's streets suggests that public altruism is severely limited. Public opinion has not yet understood that protecting human rights across all of Europe will use up much of the peace dividend that came with the end of the cold war. Understandably, politicians are reluctant to press the point. There are not many votes in dwelling on the cost of coping with intractable problems. Yet if voters are not educated in the cost of peace in Europe it will not be secure. The risk is that, as public support ebbs away, the international agencies in Kosovo will be starved of the resources they need. At worst, the whole international presence could be cut back, with the Balkans drifting slowly into an unmanageable chaos. Nato's action was a response to the danger of a redivided Europe. If it had not intervened, Europe's Orthodox and Muslim regions would have ended up beyond the pale of civilised life, prey to ruthless tyranny and subject to gross abuses of human rights. That prospect has been averted. But it has not been removed. If the international community fails to deliver on the commitment it has made, the aftermath of the war in Kosovo may come to be remembered as the time when the redivision of Europe began. \u0095 John Gray is professor of European thought at the London School of Economics.",

Jean-Michel M\u00e9chain, a gendarmerie lawyer, was questioned by an examining magistrate, Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re, yesterday, after the leaking of army documents criticising the UN administrator for Kosovo, Frenchman Bernard Kouchner, for being anti-Serb. Six weeks ago Col M\u00e9chain, who supports Dr Kouchner, was recalled from Kosovo where he was the legal adviser to the commander of the French K-For contingent, General Louis Le Mi\u00e8re. In a classified report to the defence ministry and senior officers, published by French newspapers, the general said that French soldiers were fed up with what they saw as Dr Kouchner's partiality towards ethnic Albanians. The former humanitarian affairs minister was implicitly blamed for the tension in the divided Kosovan town of Mitrovice, where ethic Albanians and Serbs have frequently clashed. The area is controlled by French troops but after questions about the French army's neutrality, other K-For troops were brought in to help. The colonel was sent back to France from Pristina on February 14 and has since been pursued by the DST, the country's counter-intelligence service. A week ago, he was involved in an incident in a Paris street while being followed by eight secret servicemen. Police had to be called after an exchange of insults and blows. Col M\u00e9chain made an official complaint against DST harassment shortly before he was arrested.

Who'd have thought such a simple, romantic guesture could be so richly deconstructed? Still, these are lean times and we'll analyse anything if the price is right. Meanwhile, let's be thankful that hand-holding in public retains at least a modicum of innocence. There are, after all, far more embarrassing ways of asserting the power play of your relationship and far more nausea-inducing parts of the anatomy to grasp. Clamping a possessive hand over your partner's arse is surely the nadir of public body contact. Perhaps I am disproportionately repelled by this practice, having had the misfortune to grow up near a biker couple who, permanently dressed in matching leather jackets bearing the legends Mr Animal and Mrs Animal, frequently sauntered down my street with Mr clutching Mrs' rear end. The fact that this impaired her ability to walk straight appeared not to trouble her husband. But perhaps I should be grateful that, at such a young age, I was instilled with an acute sense of public affection consciousness. I doubt I'm the only one who finds this kind of thing repulsive. We've all seen pictures of Hugh Grant, photographed far more than is seemly with one grubby mitt clamped to his long-suffering girlfriend's posterior, in a gesture that allows only one reading: she is mine. At least with the Beckhams there is room for multiple interpretations.",

      "body": "<p>The first call got me out of bed. It was midnight, I was reading and my female housemate was out. There was silence at the other end and I hung up. The phone rang again, and again.

They told me it was probably a fax left on redial and to turn off the ringer.</p> <p>The next night it started again but this time I waited on the line. Hanging up meant they had won. After a couple of minutes, a man's voice whispered: \"I've got your number.\" I phoned BT again and was told there was nothing they could do until the morning. And until then? The male operator asked if \"females\" lived in the house, then suggested we get a man to leave a message on our answering machine. Next morning, I rang BT again, had a trace put on the line and installed on our machine the standard BT answering message.</p> <p>More than 97,000 requests were made for traces last year. Since 1992, when BT set up its Nuisance Calls Bureau, half of all calls reported have been silent, 15% are obscene and sexual, and most are made to women. Research shows two-thirds of nuisance calls are aimed at us.</p> <p>The image of the lonely wanker heavy-breathing down the line took a more serious turn last week when a Bristol man was convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering a woman on the same day that he made threatening calls to 80 other women. In the six months preceding Jenny King's murder, Paul Hunt made 4,000 calls to women, but local police say these came to light only after he was arrested and his phone bills examined. He was a random caller: each time he dialled, he altered the last digit. If a man answered, he hung up. The police say that, to their knowledge, none of the women reported the calls.</p> <p>Why? Was it that they weren't frightened by the threats? That they thought nothing could be done? Or, worse, that the threat didn't feel out of the ordinary? It is significant that only when Hunt was convicted was his prolific phoning revealed. Until then, the calls barely featured in the hierarchy of harassment. Sexual harassment by telephone is in fact so ordinary that, according to Home Office research, one in 10 women receives obscene calls every year. Single, separated and divorced young women are the most likely targets and four out of five calls come at home, usually in the afternoon or evening.</p> <p>Equally, there is little obviously out of the ordinary about the callers. Research by sex offences consultant Ray Wyre found that, in a sample of offenders, 40% were aged 26-30 and 41% single. Of the 43% who made random calls, many got numbers from local classified and dating ads. The majority of calls, however, are made to women known to the caller. And the telephone may be the first step in an escalation of stalking.</p> <p>Claire Finch's first few encounters with a man who stalked her for four months began on the phone. The man was from the same town and got her number from the phone book. Though she reported his calls to the police and was able to get the numbers of the phone boxes from which he called, BT did not change her number immediately and after yet another midnight call, she began to panic.</p> <p>\"Was he close to home? In my area? Known to me? His silence became violence,\" says Finch, 29. \"I was shaking then and convinced the person at the end knew I was on my own.\"</p> <p>When her number was changed, the harassment intensified. The police have now arrested the man but Finch says she refuses to give her number to anyone she doesn't know well and is ex-directory. \"In the wrong hands,\" she says, \"the phone is a weapon.\"</p> <p>BT advises not to enter into conversation with a caller. Put the receiver down for 10 minutes, then replace it. Don't leave your name or number on the answering machine. Under the Telecommunications Act 1984, a malicious caller may be fined up to \u00a35,000 and/or face a maximum of six months in prison. The fact that obscene calls receive low rating as a serious form of harassment is perhaps due to the fact that the violence is psychological rather than physical. Wyre cites research that shows women who have experienced phone harassment judge the effect on them as worse than women who have not experienced it. Significantly, in all other forms of harassment, the opposite is the case, suggesting women underestimate the effect of psychological harassment - until it happens to them.</p> <p>\"Most people have no idea how phone calls can create a feeling of threat,\" Wyre says. He believes advising women to change their number is unhelpful: \"Most men who sexually harass are into the thrill of the chase and will want to find out the new number.\" Instead, Wyre says BT \"should give women the choice of putting another line in free of charge\" thus wrong-footing the harasser.</p> <p>Betsy Stanco, professor of criminology at Royal Holloway, University of London, says obsence calls are part of the continuum of sexual harassment. \"Making some forms more relevant than others creates a hierarchy of what is considered dangerous,\" she says. \"What is important is the way the phone fits into a wider web of sexual intimidation. The receiver understands that call within a wider experience of harassment: that any woman on the end of a phone is accessible, available. She understands that, at random or in particular, a man can target a woman because he wants to and that it would work. The calls tap into social relations between men and women that have used power.\"</p> <p>In the case of my caller, I didn't want a male voice on my answering machine, or to wonder if it was him every time I picked up my phone, or to waste precious time alone wondering if I were being watched, or have to record every silent call on a time sheet. After a few weeks, BT told us that 80% of the calls we had recorded came from the same number. At the same time, the calls became less frequent and then stopped. Our house had a new resident who appeared to have put our caller off: a man.</p>",

Leaflets and slideshows will be taken to inner city areas of the north by staff from the North York Moors park, to try to revive the original concept of \"people's parks\" which drove the national park movement under Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government. Pubs and chip shops in deprived areas of Middlesbrough, Hull and other centres will be used as bases under the scheme, which follows research at park visitor centres and on the free Moorsbus services which cross the huge tracts of heather inland from Whitby and Scarborough. \"Taking one bit of data on newspaper readership alone,\" said Mike Pratt of the national park headquarters in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, \"we had no end of Guardian readers on the Moorsbus last summer, but no one who took the Sun or Mirror. \"The authority is worried that the moors may be building up a bit of an exclusive image, contrary to the whole idea of green lungs for people living in urban areas - assets which were meant to be enjoyed by everybody.\" The initiative will start with a programme of \"more equitable\" information-spreading, highlighting bus services in supermarkets on Teesside to emphasise that a car is not necessary to enjoy the moors. Employers are also likely to be targeted, to encourage a return to the charabancs which left factories in Stockton and Hartlepool for the moors and coast almost every summer weekend in the 1920s. Attempts will also be made to reach particular communities, notably Asian and Afro-Caribbean families, which have been relatively slow to try out the charms of the long-distance Lyke Wake Walk and the ghostly industrial archaeology of the old ironstone industry in Rosedale. Targeted infor mation in West Yorkshire has been modestly successful in increasing black and ethnic visitors to the Yorkshire Dales national park. The initiative will finally try to tempt visitors away from a relatively small number of honeypots such as Goathland, which doubles as Aidensfield in the TV series Heartbeat and attracts readers of all known national newspapers to a village street made up of cafes and souvenir shops.

Walter Mosley, the author of the critically acclaimed Easy Rawlins mysteries, has delivered a savage polemic in book form in which he outlines his imaginary candidacy and platform and claims Americans have been \"drugged and chained and made into property\". The author claims that the current presidential race is merely a chance to vote for \"one white man in a suit over another white man in a suit\". Mosley, whom President Clinton has cited as his favourite writer, places the failure of most Americans to understand African-American history at the heart of what he sees as a catastrophic political crisis. In his manifesto, Workin' on the Chain Gang, he outlines a radical platform which he hopes will steer political debate away from the sniping between the two main presidential candidates. Mosley, 48, is the son of an African-American father and Jewish mother. He grew up in Los Angeles and lives in New York. \"Everywhere I look I see chains, from the planned obsolescence that binds us to an endless line of ever more useless machines to captivating television shows about nothing to the value of dollar bills nestled at the bottom of my pocket,\" writes Mosley, whose books include Devil in a Blue Dress, which was turned into a film starring Denzel Washington. \"My candidacy is based on my desire to break the chains of yesterday's politics,\" Mosley adds. The book is receiving prominence partly because of the absence of a black voice in the presidential race and partly because of the lack of discussion of race in the campaign. \"What do we vote for?\" he asks. \"Is that vote enough to make us free?

      "bodyText": "The broadcaster Sir Trevor McDonald has called for an end to the debate over the demise of News at Ten. The ITN newsreader gave his strongest hint yet that he had opposed the decision last year to axe the programme, the flagship in the ITV schedules for 30 years, but he urged critics and supporters to let the matter rest. Speaking after a London Institute lecture at the Cochrane Theatre, Sir Trevor said: \"We all loved the News at Ten but it's time to move on. We cannot keep looking over our shoulders at how things used to be.\" He added: \"News at Ten had been going for a long time and at ITN we are just relieved this thing has finally come to some sort of conclusion and we are able to get on with our lives.\" News at Ten was axed by ITV last March and replaced by bulletins at 6.30pm and 11pm. The decision led to criticism that ITV had \"dumbed down\" in an attempt to gain viewers. The Commons culture select committee recently recommended that News at Ten be brought back. The Independent Television Commission is also considering the evidence on whether to instruct ITV to reinstate the programme.",

Dolores Claiborne (Taylor Hackford, 1995) 12.20am, FilmFour A Stephen King homage to Hollywood's deranged-woman melodramas: Mildred Pierce meets Misery. Kathy Bates (pictured), star of the latter, plays a woman once suspected of husband murder, and 15 years later accused of killing her boss (Judy Parfitt). Her daughter (Jennifer Jason Leigh) returns to confront past and present deeds: it's Three Go Bonkers On Remote Island (PH)",

A garlicky male environment in which women didn't make films, but paid loyal service to their auteur bosses.</p> <p>Don't you think there's a superior, dated, classist tone to your films, I ask Watson.

So angry are some of the critics of the Brent East MP for his having avoided serious political damage over his under-declared income of \u00a3200,000-plus since mid-1999, they want him - and other errant MPs - to be fined the total amount of earnings that have not been declared in public. The latest attempt to underline Mr Livingstone's frontrunner status in the race for election as London mayor has coincided with a fresh attack from his main rival, the former Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson. Mr Dobson has accused Mr Livingstone of being \"an oddball\" whose description at the weekend of the IRA being \"freedom fighters\" shows he is still \"soft on terrorism\". Mr Livingstone also stands accused of being indifferent to crime problems in the capital. Whether or not these comments will damage his apparently Teflon candidacy remains to be seen in the next five weeks of the campaign. Last night he replied: \"Far from being soft on terrorism my commitment to encourage a negotiated settlement in Ireland has been shown, by events, to have been right.\" As a further indication of Mr Livingstone's talent for winning unlikely support it emerged last night that the Shirayama Shokusan corporation - which, in controversial circumstances in 1993, bought County Hall, the one-time headquarters of the greater London council - had offered him the use of his former south bank office as a campaign base, free of charge. Most of County Hall is now a hotel and leisure complex. \"We are very impressed with your energy in seeking to become mayor,\" said the Japanese company's chairman, Mac Okamoto. Mr Livingstone's excuse for not reporting the \u00a315,000 of speaking fees to the register of members' interests at Westminster - along with the \u00a3158,000 he did declare - was that the additional fees unearthed by the Daily Mirror were all paid late. But Brian Sedgemore, one of his most most vociferous critics on the Labour benches at Westminster, last night called this comment a \"daft\" excuse and demanded a further investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Elizabeth Filkin. Mr Livingstone was forced to make what Mr Sedgemore, MP for Hackney South, called \"a synthetic, cursory, insincere and hypocritical\" apology to the Commons after Mrs Filkin found against him. But the fact that the standards commissioner had been tipped off in an underhand fashion, by a supporter of Mr Dobson's candidacy, turned the controversy into a dirty tricks row - with every sign that the former GLC leader, now independent candidate for mayor, was suffering little political damage. In a letter sent to Mrs Filkin, Mr Sedgemore last night complained that the revelation of the undeclared \u00a315,000 suggested that the MP's earlier declaration - made after the close of Labour's London ballot, narrowly won by Mr Dobson - might be inaccurate.

      "body": "<p>Alex Comfort, who has died aged 80, was a physician, poet, novelist, anarchist and pacifist. He was never known for the length of his temper, and would have been extremely annoyed today to be reminded that, for many people, his name means only sex. Never mind his poetry, his novels, his gerontology, his startling politics or the breathtaking width of his mind and the power of his grasp; it was his production of a couple of books about sex as a leisure activity, like snooker or tennis, or cooking and eating, that made him a household name.</p> <p>It was back in the early 1970s that James Mitchell, of publishers Mitchell Beasley, suggested to his friend, Comfort, that he might write a sex manual. Mitchell had previously published an anthology, The Complete Lover, a rather soggy collection of poems, stories and mildly erotic romance for which Comfort had written a chapter on real sex; this had been withdrawn from The Complete Lover because the American publishers, McGraw Hill, would have been too shocked by it - but the idea remained with Mitchell.</p> <p>Thus was The Joy Of Sex: A Gourmet Guide To Lovemaking, born to be published in 1972. It was an easy birth, incidentally. Comfort wrote the book in two weeks, drawing largely , it was said by insiders, on his affair with the woman who was to become his second wife . Its original title was Cordon Bleu Sex (hence the chapters headed Starters, Main Courses, Sauces and Pickles) but the owners of the Cordon Bleu name objected, so the title was changed.</p> <p>The illustrations were not. Depicting a bearded man with a less than perfect body, and a woman equally ordinary, they enabled readers to relate to the book as no previous sex manual had. The unselfconscious text showed a lively interest in all sorts of highways and byways of sexuality - like the role of the big toe in lovemaking, and the pleasures of a little light bondage - and made people feel comfortable. It sold all over the world, in a myriad of languages, to the tune of 12m copies. It is still selling, with its offspring, New Joy Of Sex, More Joy Of Sex, Pocket Joy Of Sex et al.</p> <p>That it was a good book is undoubted. Comfort couldn't have written bad English if he tried, and his erudition laced the text to make it worth reading, even if you weren't in search of the perfect orgasm. It was also good because of what it did for so many people's sex lives. Comfort gave his readers permission to regard sex as a normal occupation and a perfectly respectable interest. As an agony aunt, I was happy to recommend Comfort's books rather than my own because they were so effective. I had many letters from people who had found reading Joy Of Sex a liberating experience.</p> <p>Comfort is on record as having rather despised his sex books, for all they had made him so amazingly rich, and wanting to be remembered for his poetry, politics, novels and science. Yet, in a sense, he is so remembered by those millions of readers. The Joy of Sex is often anarchic - frequently poetic and sometimes funny. The jokes are good; even the science is there. One knows as a reader, at gut level, that this writer got the facts right as well as the feelings. It was no mean feat, and he can rest assured that he will be remembered for the right reasons.</p> <p>He is survived by a son, and three grandchildren.</p> <p><b>David Goodway writes: </b> Alex Comfort's first book, The Silver River, an account of a voyage to Argentina and Senegal, was published in 1938, when he was still a pupil at Highgate School, the son of an LCC education officer. From there, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, to read natural sciences. He had a dazzling academic career - and, until his early 30s, a dazzling literary career.</p> <p>His fictional debut came in 1941 with No Such Liberty, written while he was at Cambridge. The Power House, a long and acclaimed third novel, appeared in 1944. On This Side Nothing, probably Comfort's best novel, followed in 1949. There were also several books of verse.

      "bodyText": "Alex Comfort, who has died aged 80, was a physician, poet, novelist, anarchist and pacifist. He was never known for the length of his temper, and would have been extremely annoyed today to be reminded that, for many people, his name means only sex. Never mind his poetry, his novels, his gerontology, his startling politics or the breathtaking width of his mind and the power of his grasp; it was his production of a couple of books about sex as a leisure activity, like snooker or tennis, or cooking and eating, that made him a household name. It was back in the early 1970s that James Mitchell, of publishers Mitchell Beasley, suggested to his friend, Comfort, that he might write a sex manual. Mitchell had previously published an anthology, The Complete Lover, a rather soggy collection of poems, stories and mildly erotic romance for which Comfort had written a chapter on real sex; this had been withdrawn from The Complete Lover because the American publishers, McGraw Hill, would have been too shocked by it - but the idea remained with Mitchell. Thus was The Joy Of Sex: A Gourmet Guide To Lovemaking, born to be published in 1972. It was an easy birth, incidentally. Comfort wrote the book in two weeks, drawing largely , it was said by insiders, on his affair with the woman who was to become his second wife . Its original title was Cordon Bleu Sex (hence the chapters headed Starters, Main Courses, Sauces and Pickles) but the owners of the Cordon Bleu name objected, so the title was changed. The illustrations were not. Depicting a bearded man with a less than perfect body, and a woman equally ordinary, they enabled readers to relate to the book as no previous sex manual had. The unselfconscious text showed a lively interest in all sorts of highways and byways of sexuality - like the role of the big toe in lovemaking, and the pleasures of a little light bondage - and made people feel comfortable. It sold all over the world, in a myriad of languages, to the tune of 12m copies. It is still selling, with its offspring, New Joy Of Sex, More Joy Of Sex, Pocket Joy Of Sex et al. That it was a good book is undoubted. Comfort couldn't have written bad English if he tried, and his erudition laced the text to make it worth reading, even if you weren't in search of the perfect orgasm. It was also good because of what it did for so many people's sex lives. Comfort gave his readers permission to regard sex as a normal occupation and a perfectly respectable interest. As an agony aunt, I was happy to recommend Comfort's books rather than my own because they were so effective. I had many letters from people who had found reading Joy Of Sex a liberating experience. Comfort is on record as having rather despised his sex books, for all they had made him so amazingly rich, and wanting to be remembered for his poetry, politics, novels and science. Yet, in a sense, he is so remembered by those millions of readers. The Joy of Sex is often anarchic - frequently poetic and sometimes funny. The jokes are good; even the science is there. One knows as a reader, at gut level, that this writer got the facts right as well as the feelings. It was no mean feat, and he can rest assured that he will be remembered for the right reasons. He is survived by a son, and three grandchildren. David Goodway writes: Alex Comfort's first book, The Silver River, an account of a voyage to Argentina and Senegal, was published in 1938, when he was still a pupil at Highgate School, the son of an LCC education officer. From there, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, to read natural sciences. He had a dazzling academic career - and, until his early 30s, a dazzling literary career. His fictional debut came in 1941 with No Such Liberty, written while he was at Cambridge. The Power House, a long and acclaimed third novel, appeared in 1944. On This Side Nothing, probably Comfort's best novel, followed in 1949. There were also several books of verse. Art And Social Responsibility (1946), was his first collection of articles. His lifelong pacifism dated from his schooldays; during the second world war, he was, he said, \"an aggressive anti-militarist\". It came to a head in the campaign against the indiscriminate bombing of Germany. Pacifism led to anarchism, for he came to believe that pacifism rested \"solely upon the historical theory of anarchism\". The finest single statement of Comfort's anarchism is Peace And Disobedience (1946), one of the many pamphlets he wrote for Peace News and the Peace Pledge Union (and reprinted in 1994 in Against Power And Death). But his classic contribution to anarchist thought is Authority And Delinquency In The Modern State (1950), a remarkable application of the findings of psychiatry and social psychology to contemporary politics .

The fact that he had been crippled since childhood, and was severely ill during his final years as a performer, merely added to his stature. He was truly brave - both physically, and in the way that he approached his music.</p> <p>That bravery was evident at his first major London concert, at the Hammersmith Odeon in May 1978, at the height of the punk era. The audience were told to prepare for \"one of the jewels in England's crown\", and on came not Dury but his hero, the veteran music-hall star Max Wall, who was barracked by the crowd until Dury stormed on to quieten them down. When he reappeared with his band, he hobbled across the stage, supported by a stick, looking like some spivvy update of a Dickensian villain. The punks were suitably impressed.</p> <p>Here was a man already in his mid-30s, who looked crippled but dangerous, and had an armoury of quite extraordinary songs, ranging from the realistically romantic to the outrageous. He could belt out a thoughtful rock song like Sweet Gene Vincent, and then introduce a distinctive Essex spin. Even hardcore punks were taken aback by the stories of Plaistow Patricia or Billericay Dickie, dealing with the life and loves of losers, chancers and wide-boys from the east end and beyond. No one could match lyrics like \"a love affair with Nina in the back of my Cortina, a seasoned- up hyena couldn't have been more obscener\".</p> <p>The man responsible was born in Harrow , west London. His father was a bus driver and later a chauffeur, who split up with his university-educated mother soon after the war. The young Ian went to live in Upminster, Essex, with his mum, but contracted polio at the age of seven. He spent several years in hospital, and at a disabled school in Sussex, then moved to the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe. He left, with three O-levels, for Walthamstow Art School.</p> <p>Then came the Royal College of Art, a stint teaching art in Canterbury, and, in 1970, the formation of his first band, Kilburn and the High Roads. They developed a minor following on the emerging London pub-rock scene, and their first album, Handsome, in 1974. It included some distinctive Dury lyrics, but was not successful.</p> <p>The transformation came after Dury started writing with pianist Chas Jankel and signed to the independent Stiff label, co-founded by David Robinson, \"one of the great showmen and the godfather of British funk.\" Dury toured with his fellow Stiff artists, including Elvis Costello, and, in October 1977, released his classic New Boots And Panties!! The album, which sold more than 1m copies, included the erotic Wake Up And Make Love With Me. In April 1978, Dury notched up his first top-ten single, What A Waste, followed later the same year by the number-one hit, Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick, and, a year later, Reasons To Be Cheerful (Part 3). In 1980, the compilation album Juke Box Dury packaged these singles along with Dury's best-known stage anthem, Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock 'n' Roll.</p> <p>At the time, Dury insisted to me that, as an unlikely pop star, he was merely continuing his career as an artist: \"I was a painter for seven years, a successful illustrator for two years, and now I'm a rock 'n' roll singer. I still feel I'm doing the same thing, but I'm not painting with paints.\" As for his physical disability, he had confidently used it as a part of his stage act. \"I'm charismatic, and I'm not ashamed about my physical appearance,\" he said. \"Even good-looking people have got a weakness. My weakness is so obvious that there's no point in worrying about it. Luckily, I'm quite interesting to look at. I know 'cos I painted myself as an art student about 500 times.\"</p> <p>He succeeded partly because of the care and attention he put into his work, explaining: \"I ain't a poet, I'm a lyricist,\" and spending weeks carefully perfecting his songs. He described his influences as \"the Stax and Motown labels and Max Miller, with a lot of television thrown in.\"</p> <p>During the 1980s, with the waning of punk and the rise of the new romantics, Dury fell out of fashion, despite some glorious tours with his band, the Blockheads. But he continued his policy of musical bravery, collaborating with trumpeter Don Cherry on the 1980 set Laughter, and travelling to Nassau the following year to record with the reggae rhythm section, Sly and Robbie, for Lord Upminster.</p> <p>This was the Year Of The Disabled, and Dury contributed the thoughtfully realistic Spasticus Autisticus. The song, which contained lines like \"I dribble when I nibble\", was considered to be in such bad taste that, despite Dury's own disability, it was banned from radio play.</p> <p>The departure of Chaz Jankel from the Blockheads proved a more serious blow and, in 1984, after the release of the unsuccessful album 4000 Weeks Holiday, Dury took a rest from live performance, and concentrated on acting. He appeared in a series of unremarkable films, including Polanski's Pirates (1986) and Hearts Of Fire, a vehicle for Bob Dylan. He had more success on stage the following year, in the Royal Court production of Jim Carter's Road. Two years later, he was back at the Court with a musical, Apples, which he had co-written with former Blockhead Mickey Gallagher. It was not a success, but Dury had continued with his policy of doing exactly what he wanted.</p> <p>Never too concerned about personal wealth, he had turned down an offer from Andrew Lloyd Webber to provide the lyrics for Cats (a commission that reportedly earned millions for Richard Stilgoe). Dury had a simple explanation for rejecting Lloyd Webber: \"I can't stand his music.\"</p> <p>In 1990, the Blockheads came together again, initially to play a benefit for their former drummer Charlie Charles, who was suffering from cancer. The reunion was so successful that further shows followed over the next two years, and several members of the band collaborated on Dury's 1993 album, The Bus Driver's Prayer And Other Stories. Then, just as his career was heading for another upswing, Dury himself was diagnosed as suffering from cancer. In 1996, a tumour was removed from his colon, but two years later, further tumours were detected on his liver.</p> <p>He reacted, in typical fashion, by plunging himself back into work, and 1998 will be remembered as his finest period since the glory days of the late 1970s. Once again reunited with Chaz Jankel and the Blockheads, he embarked on a series of concerts that showed he had lost none of his old verve, wit or musical skill. Their songs ranged from the funk and black humour of Mash It Up Harry and Jack Shit Georgie (an attack on the education system), through to a love song, You're My Baby.</p> <p>Their new album, Mr Love Pants, was rightly hailed as the best Dury in two decades, and its success led to a series of triumphant shows that continued this year. Only last month he gave an ebullient show at the London Palladium, and also made a guest appearance on a new Madness single, Drip Fed Fred. His plans had included an appearance at the Poetry Oympics, alongside Joe Strummer, next month.</p> <p>Ian Dury married twice. His first wife, Betty, was a fellow art student, and they had a son and daughter by the time they were divorced in 1985. After Betty later died of cancer, Dury married Sophie Tilson, a sculptress daughter of artist Joe Tilson, and 23 years his junior. Talking about his cancer in 1998, he said that he wouldn't be worried by the prospect of dying if it weren't for his two young sons, Bill and Albert.</p> <p>Ian Dury, singer, songwriter and actor, born May 12 1942; died March 27 2000</p>",

Once again reunited with Chaz Jankel and the Blockheads, he embarked on a series of concerts that showed he had lost none of his old verve, wit or musical skill. Their songs ranged from the funk and black humour of Mash It Up Harry and Jack Shit Georgie (an attack on the education system), through to a love song, You're My Baby. Their new album, Mr Love Pants, was rightly hailed as the best Dury in two decades, and its success led to a series of triumphant shows that continued this year. Only last month he gave an ebullient show at the London Palladium, and also made a guest appearance on a new Madness single, Drip Fed Fred. His plans had included an appearance at the Poetry Oympics, alongside Joe Strummer, next month. Ian Dury married twice. His first wife, Betty, was a fellow art student, and they had a son and daughter by the time they were divorced in 1985. After Betty later died of cancer, Dury married Sophie Tilson, a sculptress daughter of artist Joe Tilson, and 23 years his junior. Talking about his cancer in 1998, he said that he wouldn't be worried by the prospect of dying if it weren't for his two young sons, Bill and Albert. Ian Dury, singer, songwriter and actor, born May 12 1942; died March 27 2000",

      "body": "<p>The company which has dominated the world diamond trade for nearly three-quarters of a century yesterday guaranteed for the first time that the stones it sells do not originate from rebel-held areas in Africa.</p> <p>At a London sale for its registered buyers De Beers, which markets around 65% of all diamond production, promised that the diamonds had not fuelled the conflicts in Angola and Congo.</p> <p>The move follows intense international criticism of the company's practices in the 1990s when it bought billions of dollars worth of diamonds from war-torn areas in west and central Africa, allowing rebel groups to buy arms and supplies on the black market.</p> <p>A spokesman said it would also continue its ban on stones from Sierra Leone, where diamonds fuelled a horrific conflict marked by the rebels systematic hacking off civilians' hands, arms and legs from civilians, even those of tiny children.</p> <p>While human rights groups welcomed the initiative, diamond experts expressed scepticism that De Beers would be able to control the complex smuggling routes associated with the trade.</p> <p>A spokesman for London-based group Global Witness, which spearheaded a campaign for more accountability, said the decision could only be regarded as genuine if De Beers promised never to buy \"conflict diamonds\" again.</p> <p>For decades the rationale of De Beers - effectively a cartel - has been to buy as much of the world's diamond production as possible and to stockpile to maintain the price. Until 1998, De Beers's annual reports boasted of the company's ability to absorb Angolan production.</p> <p>Its sales, which are held 10 times a year, are attended by about 125 \"sight holders\" - cutters, polishers and dealers - from Antwerp, Tel Aviv, Bombay and New York.</p> <p>Yesterday's guarantee was the company's response to a June 1998 United Nations resolution which prohibited the import of Angolan diamonds without a certificate of origin from the Angolan government.</p> <p>The frailty of that embargo was demonstrated last October when De Beers announced that it was suspending all imports of Angolan diamonds because of evidence of fraudulent certificates.</p> <p>The UN report on sanctions-busting, published last month, detailed how diamonds from the Unita-held areas of Angola were smuggled on to the world market through Rwanda, the Ivory Coast, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia and through the unregulated parts of the diamond market in Antwerp.</p> <p>Belgium accounts for nearly 80% of the rough diamond trade. Robert Fowler, the Canadian author of the UN report, accused Belgian authorities of failing to establish an effective import identification system.</p> <p>\"Nor has any effort been made to monitor the activities of suspect brokers, dealers and traders - virtually all of whom appear to travel freely and operate without hindrance.

      "bodyText": "The company which has dominated the world diamond trade for nearly three-quarters of a century yesterday guaranteed for the first time that the stones it sells do not originate from rebel-held areas in Africa. At a London sale for its registered buyers De Beers, which markets around 65% of all diamond production, promised that the diamonds had not fuelled the conflicts in Angola and Congo. The move follows intense international criticism of the company's practices in the 1990s when it bought billions of dollars worth of diamonds from war-torn areas in west and central Africa, allowing rebel groups to buy arms and supplies on the black market. A spokesman said it would also continue its ban on stones from Sierra Leone, where diamonds fuelled a horrific conflict marked by the rebels systematic hacking off civilians' hands, arms and legs from civilians, even those of tiny children. While human rights groups welcomed the initiative, diamond experts expressed scepticism that De Beers would be able to control the complex smuggling routes associated with the trade. A spokesman for London-based group Global Witness, which spearheaded a campaign for more accountability, said the decision could only be regarded as genuine if De Beers promised never to buy \"conflict diamonds\" again. For decades the rationale of De Beers - effectively a cartel - has been to buy as much of the world's diamond production as possible and to stockpile to maintain the price. Until 1998, De Beers's annual reports boasted of the company's ability to absorb Angolan production. Its sales, which are held 10 times a year, are attended by about 125 \"sight holders\" - cutters, polishers and dealers - from Antwerp, Tel Aviv, Bombay and New York. Yesterday's guarantee was the company's response to a June 1998 United Nations resolution which prohibited the import of Angolan diamonds without a certificate of origin from the Angolan government. The frailty of that embargo was demonstrated last October when De Beers announced that it was suspending all imports of Angolan diamonds because of evidence of fraudulent certificates. The UN report on sanctions-busting, published last month, detailed how diamonds from the Unita-held areas of Angola were smuggled on to the world market through Rwanda, the Ivory Coast, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia and through the unregulated parts of the diamond market in Antwerp. Belgium accounts for nearly 80% of the rough diamond trade. Robert Fowler, the Canadian author of the UN report, accused Belgian authorities of failing to establish an effective import identification system. \"Nor has any effort been made to monitor the activities of suspect brokers, dealers and traders - virtually all of whom appear to travel freely and operate without hindrance. Once diamonds are brought to Antwerp they are almost impossible to trace,\" he said. De Beers, which itself mines about 40% of diamonds produced each year, insisted yesterday that its controls would include instructing its buying offices in Antwerp as well as Tel Aviv not to buy any diamonds imported from Africa. The company would also stop buying from the informal sector of the economy. It has closed its offices in the Congo and Guinea - two centres traditionally used for smuggling stones from Unita territory and areas held by the rebel Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone. The question of whether the origin of stones can be easily determined is much disputed. De Beers said yesterday that \"run of mine\" diamonds - those coming from a particular area - can be sourced, reversing its longstanding insistence that Angolan diamonds could not be identified. \"Our experts can be 90% certain,\" the spokesman said. But the director general of the Antwerp Diamond Council, Peter Meeus, said: \"It will be unworkable in practice. Batches of diamonds are handled in a mix. That makes a search for origin an impossible task.\" Speaking on Radio France Internationale yesterday, a spokesman for the Belgian for eign ministry said: \"It is very difficult to identify a diamond's origin. You can't find adequate systems in Africa for origin certificates.\" Earlier this month, two South African diamond dealers, who were named in the Fowler report as breaking diamond sanctions against Unita, said they had sold gems purchased from the rebels to De Beers. Brothers Joe and Ronnie de Decker were said to have supplied light weapons to Unita in exchange for the diamonds. Ronnie de Decker denied shipping arms to the rebels but admitted that between 1993 and 1997 he bought diamond parcels worth up to $5m (\u00a33m) from Unita, and says he sold them to De Beers or one of its associated companies. Mr De Decker claims De Beers was not in any doubt about the source of the diamonds. A De Beers spokesman in Johannesburg said it was \"very likely\" that the company had bought diamonds from Mr De Decker, but that it was impossible to establish where diamonds came from once they had been polished. Another dealer named in the report, David Zollman, said he stopped buying diamonds from conflict areas in 1997. Useful links: \u0095 De Beers \u0095 Global Witness",

The population of sturgeon, prized for its caviar, has declined dramatically - bottom-dwelling animals on which the fish graze were victims of the plankton blooms which cut out light to the sea floor. Bottlenosed dolphins, once thought to number a million, have been reduced to no more than 300,000. The Black Sea, landlocked apart from the narrow Bosphorus straits connecting it to the Mediterranean, has a unique ecology.

He had become an ordinary politician, with his qualities and his shortcomings, his failures.\"</p> <p>Four full ministers were replaced in the reshuffle, with four new lower level posts being created by dividing up portfolios to form an enlarged leftwing cabinet of Socialists, Communists and Greens that Mr Jospin said would prove to be \"even stronger in the pursuit of [our] reform policies\".</p> <p>A former communications minister, Catherine Tasca, took over the culture portfolio from Catherine Trautmann, who was seen as having bungled her planned reform of television advertising, while a former finance minister, Michel Sapin, replaced the luckless minister in charge of civil service reforms, Emile Zuccarelli.</p> <p>Mr Sautter, who said last week he was \"mortified\" by the failure of the tax collection reforms, resigned before the reshuffle was confirmed.</p> <p>With local elections due next year and national and presidential polls scheduled for 2002, analysts said the arrival of Mr Fabius and Mr Lang was a clear signal of Mr Jospin's desire to consolidate the party.</p> <p>Conservative MPs said the reshuffle marked a step back to a bygone era of socialism. Mr Chirac's Gaullist RPR party described the changes as \"rather sad\" and \"a return to the Mitterrand system\", while another centrist opposition group, D\u00e9mocracie Lib\u00e9rale, said the comeback of \"the old guard\" was clearly a pre-election gambit.</p> <p><b>Profile: Laurent Fabius</b></p> <p>Laurent Fabius, 53, named finance minister, is a onetime Wunderkind who for the past two years has occupied the largely ceremonial post of speaker of the national assembly. A Mitterrand protege - the late president made him his economic adviser in 1975 - Mr Fabius became the country's youngest prime minister in 1984 at the age of 37.</p> <p>Strongly critical of government economic policy over the past two years, he has called for the government to be more ambitious in cutting taxes, and to speed up privatisation.</p> <p>Quite how Mr Fabius will reconcile Mr Jospin's somewhat traditional view of Socialism with his own more liberal outlook remains to be seen - some observers say the finance portfolio may well prove a poisoned chalice for Mr Jospin's greatest political rival.</p> <p>But Mr Fabius, a graduate of the elite \u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration, is no stranger to fighting his corner. His appointment as finance minister comes after his acquittal last year on manslaughter charges, after he was accused with two of his ministers of knowingly al lowing Aids-contaminated blood to be used by the national transfusion service. France's biggest post-war public health scandal led to more than 1,000 deaths.</p> <p><b>Profile: Jack Lang</b></p> <p>Jack Lang, 60, is a familiar Socialist figure to French voters. Surprisingly, he appears to have given up hopes of becoming mayor of Paris to take over at the education ministry, a portfolio he held in 1992-93.</p> <p>The sharp-suited, politically correct mayor of Blois, Mr Lang was twice culture minister during Mitterrand's 14-year rule and is closely associated with the late president's more grandiose cultural projects, such as the new national library.</p> <p>He more than doubled the French culture budget, funded dozens of new museums, theatres, opera houses and libraries and launched an annual national music festival that draws hundreds of thousands of music-lovers into the streets every June.</p> <p>In the past two years, Mr Lang has chaired the national assembly's foreign affairs committee, and until yesterday was considered a walkover for the high-profile job of Paris mayor, for which over 60% of Parisians thought he was eminently suitable.</p> <p>But Mr Jospin may well have thought that the mayor's job was just a touch too plum, and rather than welcoming visiting dignitaries at Paris's ornate town hall, Mr Lang will now have to try to appease France's deeply unhappy teachers.</p>",

Mr Jospin, whose plans to modernise the tax, school and pension systems have run into tough union opposition, appointed Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister, and Jack Lang, the flamboyant former culture minister, to the posts of finance and education. Mr Fabius, who was prime minister under the late president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand from 1984 to 1986 and has been parliamentary speaker since 1997, replaces Christian Sautter, an uninspiring technocrat who last week was forced to cave in to striking civil servants over his bid to streamline the inefficient tax service. Mr Lang, a media-friendly populist, will take over from the education minister, Claude All\u00e8gre, whose programme of school reforms has brought tens of thousands of teachers onto the streets in protest. An opinion poll published yesterday showed a majority of voters still supported Mr Jospin's stalled attempts to drag the bloated state bureaucracies into the 21st century, with 60% saying he was capable of reforming the sprawling civil service of 5m employees. But the prime minister had to take drastic action nearly three years after his surprise general election victory of 1997 to regain the upper hand and keep alive his expected challenge to the president, Jacques Chirac, in the presidential election due in 2002. \"Everything was starting to go wrong,\" said one political analyst, Catherine Nay. \"Jospin no longer appeared invulnerable. He had become an ordinary politician, with his qualities and his shortcomings, his failures.\" Four full ministers were replaced in the reshuffle, with four new lower level posts being created by dividing up portfolios to form an enlarged leftwing cabinet of Socialists, Communists and Greens that Mr Jospin said would prove to be \"even stronger in the pursuit of [our] reform policies\". A former communications minister, Catherine Tasca, took over the culture portfolio from Catherine Trautmann, who was seen as having bungled her planned reform of television advertising, while a former finance minister, Michel Sapin, replaced the luckless minister in charge of civil service reforms, Emile Zuccarelli. Mr Sautter, who said last week he was \"mortified\" by the failure of the tax collection reforms, resigned before the reshuffle was confirmed. With local elections due next year and national and presidential polls scheduled for 2002, analysts said the arrival of Mr Fabius and Mr Lang was a clear signal of Mr Jospin's desire to consolidate the party. Conservative MPs said the reshuffle marked a step back to a bygone era of socialism. Mr Chirac's Gaullist RPR party described the changes as \"rather sad\" and \"a return to the Mitterrand system\", while another centrist opposition group, D\u00e9mocracie Lib\u00e9rale, said the comeback of \"the old guard\" was clearly a pre-election gambit. Profile: Laurent Fabius Laurent Fabius, 53, named finance minister, is a onetime Wunderkind who for the past two years has occupied the largely ceremonial post of speaker of the national assembly. A Mitterrand protege - the late president made him his economic adviser in 1975 - Mr Fabius became the country's youngest prime minister in 1984 at the age of 37. Strongly critical of government economic policy over the past two years, he has called for the government to be more ambitious in cutting taxes, and to speed up privatisation. Quite how Mr Fabius will reconcile Mr Jospin's somewhat traditional view of Socialism with his own more liberal outlook remains to be seen - some observers say the finance portfolio may well prove a poisoned chalice for Mr Jospin's greatest political rival. But Mr Fabius, a graduate of the elite \u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration, is no stranger to fighting his corner. His appointment as finance minister comes after his acquittal last year on manslaughter charges, after he was accused with two of his ministers of knowingly al lowing Aids-contaminated blood to be used by the national transfusion service. France's biggest post-war public health scandal led to more than 1,000 deaths. Profile: Jack Lang Jack Lang, 60, is a familiar Socialist figure to French voters. Surprisingly, he appears to have given up hopes of becoming mayor of Paris to take over at the education ministry, a portfolio he held in 1992-93. The sharp-suited, politically correct mayor of Blois, Mr Lang was twice culture minister during Mitterrand's 14-year rule and is closely associated with the late president's more grandiose cultural projects, such as the new national library. He more than doubled the French culture budget, funded dozens of new museums, theatres, opera houses and libraries and launched an annual national music festival that draws hundreds of thousands of music-lovers into the streets every June. In the past two years, Mr Lang has chaired the national assembly's foreign affairs committee, and until yesterday was considered a walkover for the high-profile job of Paris mayor, for which over 60% of Parisians thought he was eminently suitable. But Mr Jospin may well have thought that the mayor's job was just a touch too plum, and rather than welcoming visiting dignitaries at Paris's ornate town hall, Mr Lang will now have to try to appease France's deeply unhappy teachers.",

      "body": "<p>For almost 33 years the principality of Sealand has appeared to be an eccentric English joke. In 1966 businessman and former army major Roy Bates took a fancy to a disused gun tower seven miles off the Suffolk coast. It measured 140m by 40m and had seen little action since enemy planes flew over on their way to bombing the capital. This, he thought, was just the place to establish his kingdom - or, to be more precise, his principality. He annexed the metal structure, originally known as Roughs Tower, and immediately installed himself as Prince Roy and his wife, a former beauty queen, as Princess Joan.</p> <p>Then they set about enjoying themselves. They furnished the tower, issued their own stamps and coins (bearing the head of Princess Joan), and passports. They live there part of the time - the rest of the year they live down the coast in Westcliff-on-Sea - but some of their friends live on the tower permanently to guard it. It hasn't exactly been a quiet life - there was a failed attempt to set up a pirate radio station, the acquisition of the nation's largest inshore fishing fleet, an attempted invasion by navy helicopters, an attempt by German and Dutch armed raiders to kidnap their son and a strange link to the murder of Gianni Versace. But now they are falling victim to a multimillion-pound fraud that police believe is being carried out over the internet.</p> <p>Somewhat ironically, the prince and princess are on holiday in Spain, travelling incognito as Mr and Mrs Bates, while the Spanish civil guard is investigating a gang that is involved in arms trafficking, drug smuggling and money laundering - all of which, it seems, is being conducted with fake passports supposedly issued by the Principality of Sealand.</p> <p>Members of the family are not the subject of this investigation and, says Michael Bates, Prince Roy's son, are completely innocent. His father had a visit from a detective from the serious fraud squad, acting for Interpol, last year, but that was very polite and amicable.</p> <p>\"There is nobody more anti-drugs than my old man,\" says Bates, \"and we have never done any money laundering. I am not saying we couldn't be used as a tax haven but we have never done anything like that.\"</p> <p>Tap \"Principality of Sealand\" into your internet keyboard and chances are two sites will appear prominently. One, at <a href=\"http://www.fruitsofthesea.demon.co.uk/sealand\" target=\"_NEW\">www.fruitsofthesea.demon.co.uk/sealand</a>, is a site created by Michael Bates. Official. It tells you how the family's \"rights and claims of sovereignty over the island and its territorial waters have been ratified time after time over the intervening years by national courts and leading international jurists\".</p> <p>But there is a second website: the \"official website of the Principality of Sealand\", at <a href=\"http://www.principality-sealand.net/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.principality-sealand.net</a>. This site has a plausible explanation of the taking over of the island, features pictures of Prince Roy and his family, and is full of convincing officialese.</p> <p>\"The existence of the Principality of Sealand as a state and the 'de facto' recognition of it as a state was not only confirmed by expert opinions of renowned experts... but also by numerous legal acts undertaken by other states.\"</p> <p>True enough, as far as the family is concerned. But, says the family, the site is a fake. When you run a state that officially doesn't exist, it is hard to argue that someone is pretending to be you - but this is what the Spanish police are investigating.</p> <p>Princess Joan, 70, and Prince Roy, 78, are mystified by the latest investigation. But they are having a fine old time in a nice hotel on the Costa del Sol, where the former Miss Joan Collins from Essex does still think of herself as royalty. \"Would you ask the same question of Princess Grace of Monaco?\" she scolds.</p> <p>\"We declared an independent state and I thought if I had to have a title I couldn't think of a nicer one.\"</p> <p>They have spent millions on the island, she says, since the idea first came up during a spot of pub talk with her daring husband. People have suggested various schemes involving off-shore business schemes, but nothing came of them. \"Unless there was something that comes to the aid of England, we wouldn't do it. There is no way we would ever do anything anti-British. My family fought for generations. I am always English, no matter what. But I have dual nationality.\"</p> <p>The prince calls his wife \"the boss\", and they say they are as blissfully happy as when they got married, 51 years ago, within three months of meeting each other at a dance. And he loves his principality: \"Listen old boy, I like a bit of adventure. It's the old British tradition. Maybe Britain's changed, but there's a lot of us still about. We're very vulnerable - we are the smallest state in the world. We are wide open for criticism, but we are very careful; we don't want to do anything wrong.\"</p> <p>He reckons someone got hold of one of his passports and copied it to make huge numbers of forgeries. \"We have issued passports - several hundred. We have given them to people who work for us or people who need them. But we have never given passports [for] illegal entry. \"</p> <p>By contrast, the \"fake\" website under investigation says \"the Principality of Sealand has approximately 160,000 citizens\". In parts of the Spanish version, it reads, \"160,000 inhabitants \", quite difficult on an island 932 yards square.</p> <p>\"The population of the Principality of Sealand is primarily made up of businessmen. They live in the countries they originate from,\" the unofficial site says. \"From a political point of view, a micro-state like the Princi pality of Sealand is not very influential,\" it concedes. \"This is why the government of the Principality of Sealand founded the Sealand International Business Foundation (SIBF) as an instrument to efficiently safeguard the economic interests of the citizens organised in its network.</p> <p>\"Irrespective of his/her origin, race and his/her religion, anyone can become a citizen of the Principality if he is prepared to make use of his/her talents to establish and boost the acceptance of an emerging state.\"</p> <p>In the Spanish-language version of the site, respondents are asked to say what they are interested in: citizenship, ID cards, passports or driving licences. According to investigators from the civil guard, Spain's paramilitary police force, yesterday, those privileges are on offer to anyone willing to pay between \u00a35,500 and \u00a335,000 for a range of documents that includes titles, academic degrees and full Principality of Sealand diplomatic passports.</p> <p>They allege that a Spaniard from the southern province of Almeria, Francisco Trujillo Ruiz, is presenting himself as the \"Prince Regent of Sealand\". He drives around Madrid with diplomatic number plates and refers to his office, in a luxury building on Calle Serrano, one of the smartest streets in Madrid, as Sealand's embassy.</p> <p>The Spanish foreign ministry, like the British government, takes quite a different view. It does not recognise passports issued by the Principality of Sealand and says they do not comply with criteria laid down by the Schengen Treaty for international documents. But according to the investigation, several countries have been taken in by \"ambassadors\" who claim to represent Sealand and use their prestige in business deals.</p> <p>The embassies of Gabon, Paraguay, Nepal, Syria, Haiti, Liberia, Honduras, Jamaica, Pakistan, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Jordan and Turkey all responded to requests for information from Sealand representatives who claim to be preparing lucrative investments in those countries.</p> <p>Access to other Sealand privileges does not come cheap. There is a basic \"goodwill\" charge of \u00a3300 for the first contact. Membership of \"Mare Libertas\", described as Sealand's exclusive international business foundation, costs \u00a325,000. Its main project was described as the construction of a micro-city in Sealand, with ports, sports com plexes, a medical centre, a cathedral, heliports and universities.</p> <p>Trujillo Ruiz's team all hold \"official\" titles. His legal adviser is described as the \"secretary general of the state\", and there is a \"foreign affairs minister\" and a \"chief political adviser\". The civil guard is investigating the group, which appears to be \"an organised crime ring\" concentrating its activities on falsification and swindling. Documents supposedly issued by Sealand have been passed to investigating magistrates, who will decide whether to order arrests.</p> <p>This is not the first time that passports from Sealand have found their way into the news. One was found on the killer of Gianni Versace, Andrew Cunanan, and he was said to have a car with Sealand diplomatic plates. In 1997 forged Sealand passports were used to launder drug money in Slovenia, and there were reports that 4,000 forged passports were sold at \u00a31,000 a head before China's takeover of Hong Kong. People involved in an illegal pyramid-selling scheme in eastern Europe had Sealand papers; one had border stamps from Libya, Iraq and Iran.</p> <p>This hardly seems to be Prince Roy's fault, but it is easy to see how it happens. Official-looking, plausible papers from the Principality of Sealand may raise eyebrows in Britain but, reckon the authorities, it might not attract so much suspicion in new or faraway countries that, while aware that there are tax havens off the British coast, don't necessarily know the details.</p> <p>Michael Bates says he wrote to the Spanish website, asking them to leave his father's principality alone. Someone replied, citing connections with the good name of King Juan Carlos and paying tribute to the Sealanders. \"He said he'd written a book on Sealand,\" says Bates, which may explain the pictures on the site, \"but I'm thinking, what the hell is this all about. If you want, I'll go to Spain to confront them. I'd be only too happy to. They are doing us a dreadful disservice.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, back on Sealand, people are doing very nicely, thank you. It has electricity, television, double-glazing in the 75ft towers.</p> <p>\"It's not a palace, but it's not too bad,\" says Michael Bates. There are ongoing talks about annexing more land, maybe within the next couple of years, and even setting up a casino.</p> <p>Though Sealand is not recognised by the British government, the authorities don't make life too difficult, he says. Ashore, he runs a shellfish business in Leigh-on-Sea, and says he has one of only 14 licences in the Thames estuary to farm cockles. He plans to keep Sealand going, even when his parents die. The principality has seen its way through other crises and it will see its way through this one.</p> <p>There have been worse moments. In 1967, when the Ministry of Defence tried to evict them, sending out navy helicopters and the Royal Maritime auxiliary vessel Golden Eye for what Prince Roy liked to call the Battle of Roughs Tower, gunshots and molotov cocktails were fired back - as a \"warning\". Prince Roy was hauled to court, but a judge ruled that the platform was outside the three-mile limit of territorial waters, making the prince immune from his order.</p> <p>In 1978, German and Dutch raiders - businessmen - took over the tower in a KLM helicopter in a wrangle with Prince Roy involving several million deutschmarks. They kidnapped Michael and took him to the Netherlands.</p> <p>But within days Prince Roy had recaptured the island, sliding down 100ft ropes from a helicopter, fighting the invaders and capturing one of the raiders in turn. Gernot Putz, a 34-year-old German lawyer who had been a Sealand passport holder, was charged with treason and held for seven weeks. He received a \"pardon\".</p> <p>But Michael Bates and his family are sanguine about such things. The trouble with independent states, he says, is that they are always at risk from a coup d'\u00e9tat. \"If you are your own defence, you have got nobody to bleat to.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by Adela Gooch</p>",

According to investigators from the civil guard, Spain's paramilitary police force, yesterday, those privileges are on offer to anyone willing to pay between \u00a35,500 and \u00a335,000 for a range of documents that includes titles, academic degrees and full Principality of Sealand diplomatic passports. They allege that a Spaniard from the southern province of Almeria, Francisco Trujillo Ruiz, is presenting himself as the \"Prince Regent of Sealand\". He drives around Madrid with diplomatic number plates and refers to his office, in a luxury building on Calle Serrano, one of the smartest streets in Madrid, as Sealand's embassy. The Spanish foreign ministry, like the British government, takes quite a different view. It does not recognise passports issued by the Principality of Sealand and says they do not comply with criteria laid down by the Schengen Treaty for international documents. But according to the investigation, several countries have been taken in by \"ambassadors\" who claim to represent Sealand and use their prestige in business deals. The embassies of Gabon, Paraguay, Nepal, Syria, Haiti, Liberia, Honduras, Jamaica, Pakistan, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Jordan and Turkey all responded to requests for information from Sealand representatives who claim to be preparing lucrative investments in those countries. Access to other Sealand privileges does not come cheap. There is a basic \"goodwill\" charge of \u00a3300 for the first contact. Membership of \"Mare Libertas\", described as Sealand's exclusive international business foundation, costs \u00a325,000. Its main project was described as the construction of a micro-city in Sealand, with ports, sports com plexes, a medical centre, a cathedral, heliports and universities. Trujillo Ruiz's team all hold \"official\" titles. His legal adviser is described as the \"secretary general of the state\", and there is a \"foreign affairs minister\" and a \"chief political adviser\". The civil guard is investigating the group, which appears to be \"an organised crime ring\" concentrating its activities on falsification and swindling. Documents supposedly issued by Sealand have been passed to investigating magistrates, who will decide whether to order arrests. This is not the first time that passports from Sealand have found their way into the news. One was found on the killer of Gianni Versace, Andrew Cunanan, and he was said to have a car with Sealand diplomatic plates. In 1997 forged Sealand passports were used to launder drug money in Slovenia, and there were reports that 4,000 forged passports were sold at \u00a31,000 a head before China's takeover of Hong Kong. People involved in an illegal pyramid-selling scheme in eastern Europe had Sealand papers; one had border stamps from Libya, Iraq and Iran. This hardly seems to be Prince Roy's fault, but it is easy to see how it happens. Official-looking, plausible papers from the Principality of Sealand may raise eyebrows in Britain but, reckon the authorities, it might not attract so much suspicion in new or faraway countries that, while aware that there are tax havens off the British coast, don't necessarily know the details. Michael Bates says he wrote to the Spanish website, asking them to leave his father's principality alone. Someone replied, citing connections with the good name of King Juan Carlos and paying tribute to the Sealanders. \"He said he'd written a book on Sealand,\" says Bates, which may explain the pictures on the site, \"but I'm thinking, what the hell is this all about. If you want, I'll go to Spain to confront them. I'd be only too happy to. They are doing us a dreadful disservice.\" Meanwhile, back on Sealand, people are doing very nicely, thank you. It has electricity, television, double-glazing in the 75ft towers. \"It's not a palace, but it's not too bad,\" says Michael Bates. There are ongoing talks about annexing more land, maybe within the next couple of years, and even setting up a casino. Though Sealand is not recognised by the British government, the authorities don't make life too difficult, he says. Ashore, he runs a shellfish business in Leigh-on-Sea, and says he has one of only 14 licences in the Thames estuary to farm cockles. He plans to keep Sealand going, even when his parents die. The principality has seen its way through other crises and it will see its way through this one. There have been worse moments. In 1967, when the Ministry of Defence tried to evict them, sending out navy helicopters and the Royal Maritime auxiliary vessel Golden Eye for what Prince Roy liked to call the Battle of Roughs Tower, gunshots and molotov cocktails were fired back - as a \"warning\". Prince Roy was hauled to court, but a judge ruled that the platform was outside the three-mile limit of territorial waters, making the prince immune from his order. In 1978, German and Dutch raiders - businessmen - took over the tower in a KLM helicopter in a wrangle with Prince Roy involving several million deutschmarks. They kidnapped Michael and took him to the Netherlands. But within days Prince Roy had recaptured the island, sliding down 100ft ropes from a helicopter, fighting the invaders and capturing one of the raiders in turn. Gernot Putz, a 34-year-old German lawyer who had been a Sealand passport holder, was charged with treason and held for seven weeks. He received a \"pardon\". But Michael Bates and his family are sanguine about such things. The trouble with independent states, he says, is that they are always at risk from a coup d'\u00e9tat. \"If you are your own defence, you have got nobody to bleat to.\" \u0095 Additional reporting by Adela Gooch",

      "body": "<p>There's an episode in the hit Mafia television series The Sopranos when mobster Tony Soprano asks his girlfriend what the painting of a swimming-pool in their hotel room makes her think of. \"It makes me think of David Hockey [sic].\" Tony is troubled, thoughtful. He started seeing a therapist because of dreams about the ducks leaving his swimming-pool, dreams that looked like a Hockney painting. </p> <p>The image of the gangster with a feeling for art is one that goes to the divided heart of our culture. Is art just for an elite, or can it be for everyone - even Tony Soprano? It's a question raised by a story in the Scotland on Sunday newspaper, which claimed that the Scottish painter Peter Howson has had to deal with the Glasgow underworld for the past 15 years. Howson, internationally known for his macho figurative paintings, is quoted in the newspaper telling how his strange relationship with the world of crime began when he was visited in the 1980s by the kingpin of the Glasgow crime scene, the late Arthur Thompson Sr, who offered cash on the spot for a canvas. Howson found himself supplying paintings to the city's criminals for a fraction of the price charged by his London dealer. When he tried to renegotiate, he got death threats. Gangsters like art, it seems, but they like it cheap. </p> <p>Howson's dealer in London, Matthew Flowers, now says that the story contains so many inaccuracies the artist is planning legal action. Howson will not comment until he issues a statement later this week. One thing you can say about Howson is that his bombastic, heavy breathing paintings revelling in a world of male violence are the kind of art you can easily picture in a hard man's mansion, next to the one of the dogs playing snooker. </p> <p>Personally, I hope there is nothing to the story, because I would like to think gangsters have better taste, like Tony Soprano. In the 1960s the Kray twins were familiar figures on the London art scene. The actress Anita Pallenberg remembers being in Morocco with the art dealer Robert Fraser, who represented the pop artists Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton, and meeting the Krays on the beach in Tangier. Fraser was a friend of theirs. </p> <p>In 1980, Francis Bacon painted a portrait of the Krays - a romantic, anti-heroic celebration of male sexuality and violence in which one of the twins aims a phallic shotgun straight out of the painting at the viewer. Bacon's lover George Dyer was an ineffectual hanger-on from the Krays' circles; no wonder Bacon's painting of the Krays has a personal and darkly loving quality. Bacon wasn't the only artist to be seduced by the world of violent crime. In 1964, Andy Warhol painted huge portraits of America's Most Wanted Men on the New York State Pavilion at the New York World's Fair. They were painted over, reportedly because the governor was worried about offending New York's Italian community. But Warhol's paintings, based on police mugshots, were celebratory and openly sexual: these were his most wanted men. </p> <p>These strange magnetic connections between art and organised crime go against everything we believe about art and sensitivity. Art is supposed to be good. Yet not only are artists drawn to crime, criminals are drawn to art. The police believe that stolen and forged paintings are used as gifts and sweeteners in the underworld. Police experts insist that this is solely because of their perceived monetary value - they are not valued as art. But how can they be so sure? You can see why the police want to believe the criminal has no finer feelings. The way we imagine the gangster's world is fixated on this question - can a killer have a soul? Can you have style and taste and still be wicked? In The Godfather films, Marlon Brando is a man of natural good taste, and when Martin Scorsese came to refute this benign vision of the mob in Goodfellas he does it through a critique of aesthetics. His gangsters have style but no culture. </p> <p>Yet the Italian mob, in particular, has good evidence for claiming art and culture on its side. In the Italian Renaissance, the artist was widely seen as prone to violence and brutality. The 16th century sculptor Cellini talks frankly in his autobiography about committing brutal assaults and murders. The Renaissance artists Leone Leoni and Francesco \"Torbido\" of Venice were notoriously violent men. Recently a spate of biographies have argued over whether Carravaggio was a murderer - but he has certainly been remembered as such. Art and violence seemed indistinguishable in the sweaty, physical world of Renaissance Italy. </p> <p>Today, art is seen in the home of the Sicilian Mafia as an antidote to mob law. One of the reforms introduced by the anti-Mafia mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, is an annual cultural festival that invites avant-garde artists to Sicily to beat ancient traditions with modernism. In 1997, the British artist Richard Long walked across Sicily, through the Mafia stronghold of Corleone, in what locals saw as a therapeutic rejection of the Mafia's rule. </p> <p>But does art heal? Or does it look good in a gangland front room? The most intense relationship between a modern artist and a real-life hardman was the friendship that developed in the 1970s between the German sculptor Joseph Beuys, famous for his shamanistic art that used felt and fat and ritual gestures, and the violent criminal Jimmy Boyle. Boyle was on an art therapy course in Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow when he saw photographs of Beuys living in a cage with a coyote and wrote to the artist, claiming to be a coyote. They had discussions about art and freedom, and Boyle - who has since written books, has art exhibitions and is an icon of reformsees Beuys as his mentor. </p> <p>But have you ever seen a sculpture by Jimmy Boyle? Francis Bacon's painting of the Krays is a dark masterpiece. Cellini's sculpture has an erotic violence that makes it unsurprising that he killed people. In art, there is no right and wrong. Jimmy Boyle makes bronze figurative art that is a better use of his time than beating people up, but that's the best you can say about it.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Although I am 46 years old and have had many long-term relationships with women, only once have I been sexually unfaithful. That I still recall it with horror years later makes me wonder if I am not a trifle neurotic about the issue.</p> <p>We had known each other for some time when we met up for a drink at a pub with no lust aforethought on my part. She invited me back for a coffee and we drunkenly ended up in bed.</p> <p>There was a bare minimum of preliminaries. The act itself cannot have lasted more than a couple of minutes. Immediately it was over I leapt under the shower to wash away my \"crime\" and gracelessly slunk straight off.</p> <p>That is the sum total of my infidelities. In June I will be married for the first and, hopefully, only time and I am as sure as any man can be that I shall never again have sex with anyone other than my wife-to-be.</p> <p>It would be nice to be able to feel virtuous and even a bit smug about this. But having recently investigated infidelity in making a TV programme and having interviewed all manner of people about it, I have been forced to question my faithful tendencies.</p> <p>Were we born to be faithful or is there something wrong with me that I am prepared to sacrifice my sex instinct on the altar of fidelity? Perhaps Peter Stringfellow was right when, in the course of my research, he told me that I am missing out and that it is he who is the healthy one - if I had all his opportunities would I not also want as many different women, as nubile and as often as possible?</p> <p>Pathologising Stringfellow's promiscuous and, on occasion, self-avowedly duplicitous behaviour is easy. But much of what I have to say about him goes for all sexual betrayers.</p> <p>He is the first to admit that he has simply \"not grown up\" in wanting so many different partners. Taken literally, rather than as a value judgement, this is certainly true because we do not start life faithful. As small children all of us have a fairly indiscriminate sensuality (Freud's \"polymorphous perversity\") that shifts between the mouth, the anus and the genitalia. Both sexes are capable of orgasm from a young age. Although boys cannot ejaculate, as early as five months they have been observed to achieve a striking duplicate of adult orgasm. Girls are capable of real orgasms from the age of three.</p> <p>There is a decrease in overt sexual behaviour during later childhood, but with the onset of puberty, snogging and heavy petting of large numbers of partners becomes normal. In mid-teens a theoretical commitment to the principle of monogamy grows, although it is often contradicted by promiscuous practice. Only in the later teens are longer term monogamous bonds usually forged. After that, rates of infidelity plummet with each succeeding decade, levelling off around retirement. Given the strong connection between youth and promiscuity, there is no doubt that Stringfellow is not grown up.</p> <p>How uncommon is his pattern of sexual behaviour? Very few of the studies about sex can be trusted, but there is one that is as reliable as can be. This was the survey of nearly 20,000 Britons' sexual behaviour that Baroness Thatcher tried to ban in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Unprecedented care was taken by the researchers to overcome the usual shortcomings of such surveys, and the results are probably as accurate as is possible. Only 15% of the men and 8% of the women reported having had an affair in the previous five years. Among the married, the figures were even lower: 8% of husbands, 4% of wives. While the lifetime figures would be higher than this, if they are even twice as great that would still make infidelity pretty rare.</p> <p>The British Sexual Survey revealed that, in general, we don't have nearly as much sex as you might think. For instance, fully 52% of women and 38% of men had had only two or fewer partners in their lifetime. This suggests that Stringfellow is unusual if not grossly abnormal: only 24% of all men have slept with more than 10 partners in their lives. For the pathology of infidelity we must turn to the psychiatrists. Promiscuity is used as one of the defining features of a person with antisocial personality disorder (a psychopath). The psychopath's lack of empathy with others and minimal conscience about selfish actions make it easier to betray lovers. But Stringfellow is not mentally ill or a psychopath.</p> <p>A new book (The Dangerous Passion, Bloomsbury) by the American sex psychologist David Buss provides evidence that some of Stringfellow's characteristics are associated with infidelity in the normal population. In a sample of 107 married couples, three personality traits predicted who would be unfaithful: narcissism, lack of conscience and impulsiveness. Elements of all these are to be found in Stringfellow.</p> <p>Stringfellow's statistical unusualness and immaturity encourage me to feel that he is the one with the problem, not me.

They wake up and they scratch, they fart and they fight, they eat and they sleep. That's pretty much a baboon day.</p> <p>\"Now that's not a good day for a baboon, nor is that a bad day for a baboon, that's just a day because they don't have the choices.

It may be normal to be faithful in sexually inhibited Britain, but that isn't true of many other countries or past societies.

      "bodyText": "Although I am 46 years old and have had many long-term relationships with women, only once have I been sexually unfaithful. That I still recall it with horror years later makes me wonder if I am not a trifle neurotic about the issue. We had known each other for some time when we met up for a drink at a pub with no lust aforethought on my part. She invited me back for a coffee and we drunkenly ended up in bed. There was a bare minimum of preliminaries. The act itself cannot have lasted more than a couple of minutes. Immediately it was over I leapt under the shower to wash away my \"crime\" and gracelessly slunk straight off. That is the sum total of my infidelities. In June I will be married for the first and, hopefully, only time and I am as sure as any man can be that I shall never again have sex with anyone other than my wife-to-be. It would be nice to be able to feel virtuous and even a bit smug about this. But having recently investigated infidelity in making a TV programme and having interviewed all manner of people about it, I have been forced to question my faithful tendencies. Were we born to be faithful or is there something wrong with me that I am prepared to sacrifice my sex instinct on the altar of fidelity? Perhaps Peter Stringfellow was right when, in the course of my research, he told me that I am missing out and that it is he who is the healthy one - if I had all his opportunities would I not also want as many different women, as nubile and as often as possible? Pathologising Stringfellow's promiscuous and, on occasion, self-avowedly duplicitous behaviour is easy. But much of what I have to say about him goes for all sexual betrayers. He is the first to admit that he has simply \"not grown up\" in wanting so many different partners. Taken literally, rather than as a value judgement, this is certainly true because we do not start life faithful. As small children all of us have a fairly indiscriminate sensuality (Freud's \"polymorphous perversity\") that shifts between the mouth, the anus and the genitalia. Both sexes are capable of orgasm from a young age. Although boys cannot ejaculate, as early as five months they have been observed to achieve a striking duplicate of adult orgasm. Girls are capable of real orgasms from the age of three. There is a decrease in overt sexual behaviour during later childhood, but with the onset of puberty, snogging and heavy petting of large numbers of partners becomes normal. In mid-teens a theoretical commitment to the principle of monogamy grows, although it is often contradicted by promiscuous practice. Only in the later teens are longer term monogamous bonds usually forged. After that, rates of infidelity plummet with each succeeding decade, levelling off around retirement. Given the strong connection between youth and promiscuity, there is no doubt that Stringfellow is not grown up. How uncommon is his pattern of sexual behaviour? Very few of the studies about sex can be trusted, but there is one that is as reliable as can be. This was the survey of nearly 20,000 Britons' sexual behaviour that Baroness Thatcher tried to ban in the early 1990s. Unprecedented care was taken by the researchers to overcome the usual shortcomings of such surveys, and the results are probably as accurate as is possible. Only 15% of the men and 8% of the women reported having had an affair in the previous five years. Among the married, the figures were even lower: 8% of husbands, 4% of wives. While the lifetime figures would be higher than this, if they are even twice as great that would still make infidelity pretty rare. The British Sexual Survey revealed that, in general, we don't have nearly as much sex as you might think. For instance, fully 52% of women and 38% of men had had only two or fewer partners in their lifetime. This suggests that Stringfellow is unusual if not grossly abnormal: only 24% of all men have slept with more than 10 partners in their lives. For the pathology of infidelity we must turn to the psychiatrists. Promiscuity is used as one of the defining features of a person with antisocial personality disorder (a psychopath). The psychopath's lack of empathy with others and minimal conscience about selfish actions make it easier to betray lovers. But Stringfellow is not mentally ill or a psychopath. A new book (The Dangerous Passion, Bloomsbury) by the American sex psychologist David Buss provides evidence that some of Stringfellow's characteristics are associated with infidelity in the normal population. In a sample of 107 married couples, three personality traits predicted who would be unfaithful: narcissism, lack of conscience and impulsiveness. Elements of all these are to be found in Stringfellow. Stringfellow's statistical unusualness and immaturity encourage me to feel that he is the one with the problem, not me. But the most convincing case for being like me was anecdotal, supplied when I interviewed Jonathan Ross, the TV presenter. Having known Ross since the mid- 80s, I can vouch for the truth of his claim that he has always been both advocate and practitioner of fidelity. His fame, appearance and undoubted wit have furnished him with innumerable opportunities to stray but he has always resisted.

The person shown on page 11 of today's (pre-printed) Guardian Education is not James Wright, vice-chancellor of Newcastle University, but John Midwinter, vice-provost of University College London. Apologies to both. In recommending the Jesus 2000 award exhibition, page 19, the Scotland edition of the Guide, yesterday, we got the name of the gallery and the name of the winner wrong. The entries may be seen at the Gallery of Modern Art, Queen Street, Glasgow. The winner was Kenny Hunter, and not Nicola Hicks, who was among the runners-up (a note of confusion introduced in the editing for which we apologise). The women's a cappella group to which we intended to refer on page 13 of the Guide (North edition), March 25, under Liverpool-Merseyside Festival, is Soul Purpose, not Foul Purpose. \u0095 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

Although Mitsubishi is poorly represented in the European market, its manufacturing base in the Netherlands will become a 50/50 joint venture with its new partner and be the bridgehead for developing and making new small cars for the European market, solving DaimerChrysler's problem about a partner for its Smart car. It will also give DaimlerChrysler a valuable entry port into the Japanese market and elsewhere in Asia where what has of late been sluggish growth is expected to take off rapidly. </p> <p>The rationale behind the latest deal, as with the others, is familiar enough. In a fiercely competitive global automotive business, manufacturers want to be able to offer consumers more choice, more cheaply, more often and to do that they know they have to take cost out of the business.

VW, which had been talking to Scania for some time, got its opportunity because the European Commission blocked the acquisition of the Swedish truck maker by rival manufacturer Volvo. What it has done is buy - at a pretty stiff price - a large slice of the shareholding in Scania owned by the Swedish investment group Investor. However, Investor remains a shareholder, at least for the time being, as does Volvo, which built up a 45.6% holding as part of its campaign to acquire Scania. </p> <p>Nevertheless, national sensitivities do exist. Although Volvo recently sold its car business to Ford it is worth remembering that a previous attempt by Renault to acquire the whole of Volvo was blocked by shareholders whose motivation was not entirely financial. </p> <p>Ahead of yesterday's deal some Swedish commentators had expressed concern that if Volvo and Scania were kept apart and one or other was taken over a by a foreign firm it could provide a fillip to the country's eurosceptics. </p> <p>Is there any comfort in this for the UK car industry where sensibilities have been badly ruffled, to say the least, by BMW's decision to dismember Rover?

But the main impetus was a commitment to ditch its \u00a360m turnover packaging business and get out of some other non-core activities. TT is promising also to switch more manufacturing capability from the UK to low-cost countries such as Mexico and Malaysia where it has established plants. Executive chairman John Newman never shied away from tough decisions and has drastically pruned down a company once regarded as a conglomerate. But Mr Newman has good reason to be keen on shareholder value. He does, after all, own nearly 10% of the company and is extremely unhappy about a share price which has fallen dramatically in the past two years - from a high of 380p in May 1998 to close at 92p yesterday. He gave strong hints that if TT remains in the stock market doghouse for much more than the next 12 months, he will consider following the example of Hall Engineering and take TT private via a management buy out. Such a move might seem attractive but Mr Newman would not like to lose the flexibility to make share-based acquisitions which remain part of his current strategy. Analysts are cautiously confident that the company, which enjoyed 19% compound growth over 10 years, is now on the mend. They are pencilling in pre-tax profits of \u00a341m for the coming 12 months heartened by Mr Newman's talks of a \"limited recovery\" in key markets.",

While the FTSE 100 index lost ground, TechMark, though still way below its best, picked up modestly as did the FTSE Midcap index as investors went shopping for good buys among smaller biotech and high technology listings. \"It is partly a year-end rush for technology ISAs,\" according to one trader. \"But the Nasdaq was also strong on Friday and today.\" Trading volume in the leading stocks was thinner than of late with dealers blaming fund manager reluctance to change their asset allocations at this stage in the financial year for the relatively modest turnover of 1.3bn shares.",

      "bodyText": "Storehouse, the embattled retail group, yesterday accepted a \u00a3200m offer for Bhs, the clothing and homewares chain, from entrepreneur Philip Green in a move which leaves its Mothercare children's shops to soldier on alone. Shares in the group, which had run up strongly in hopes that a bidding contest would produce a better price, declined sharply as the market accepted that Mr Green's \"take it or leave it\" bid represented the best deal on offer. Shares in Storehouse ended the session yesterday 8p lower at 42p. A rival consortium - including Stephen Tucker, the Monaco-based financier, Nigel Whittaker, a former Kingfisher director, and Lord MacLaurin, the ex-Tesco boss - said yesterday it would let shareholders decide on its offer to parachute in a management team to turn round the business. Other potential bidders such as Iceland, which recently cemented a deal to open food halls in Bhs shops, and the discount retailer Brown &amp; Jackson have ruled themselves out of the bidding process. Analysts said long suffering Storehouse investors were more likely to take Mr Green's money and then hope that the rump of the group, which will be left with debts of \u00a370m to \u00a380m, would provide a cash windfall of about \u00a3100m. Mr Green, who has bounced back with the Storehouse bid after his takeover approaches to Marks &amp; Spencer were rejected, said yesterday that he had no fixed plans to overhaul Bhs. But he won considerable investor support when he acquired and profitably broke up the Sears retail empire. \"At the moment I haven't got a fixed plan. Let's get it [the deal] completed. This season is pretty much in stone, they've got all the product committed so we need to work our way through that.\" Mr Green said he would spend the next two months evaluating Bhs before deciding on an action plan. He had made no decisions about the Bhs management - now headed by Stephen Tague. He added: \"I need to interview the people, meet the people and evaluate where we are. I never have preconceived plans. \"I haven't met the management yet and I need to get the management on side.\" Meetings would take place in the next \"two to three days\" but before then he thought it important not to worry staff and executives by putting about ideas for change. Mr Green said he had been prepared to bid for the whole group if the Storehouse board had turned down his offer for Bhs, although he admitted the management was \"down the road to sorting out Mothercare and I'd rather focus on sorting out Bhs\". Mothercare accounted for \u00a3472m of the group's sales of \u00a3856.2m last year. However, the company expects better returns following a decision to concentrate on the pre-school age group and the addition of 40 large Mothercare World stores, which have been performing better than the average in the portfolio. More than 80 Mothercare stores have been targeted for closure. A Storehouse official said the January trading statement showed that the Mothercare business was improving and she said the group now intended to invest in its internet business.

A contract for six roll-on roll-off ships will be placed early next month and the total deal, which also includes a 20-year management contract, is said to be worth a total of \u00a31bn. Only one of the four bidding consortiums includes a British shipyard - the Sealion grouping is lead by BAE Systems which owns the Govan yard in Scotland. Although all the groups vying to win the lucrative deal have to include a quote for work to be carried out by a British shipbuilder, this does involve any commitment to use a UK yard. A spokesman for the MoD, who admitted that this was the first time the government had decided to build ships under the private finance initiative, said: \"There are considerable savings to be had and we have to get the best value for money- we have to justify the money we spend as part of the defence budget.\" But the failure by the government to support hard-pressed British shipbuilding is bound to increase criticism of its attitude towards traditional industry, particularly as it follows the loss of a cruise ship contract by the Northern Ireland yard Harland &amp; Wolff, which now has only the slimmest prospects of survival. The government's difficulties have worsened with accusations in the maritime industry that the MoD will seek to offset this disappointment by placing a \u00a3350m contract for troop ships - which qualify as military vessels to be built in a British yard - with the Belfast shipbuilder. Jaap Kroese, the owner of Swan Hunter - which is based in the Wallsend constituency of trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers - has already threatened to sue if the troop ship contract is awarded to Harland &amp;Wolff on political grounds. Mr Byers has been criticised for his handling of BMW's decision to sell Rover in a move which is expected to cost 6,000 jobs, and will not welcome fresh anger from shipbuilders.

      "body": "<p>The thought of Sarah Lucas on the rampage in <a href=\"http://www.freud.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Sigmund Freud's house</a> feels unlikely and alarming, but also disgracefully inevitable. Somehow, I don't see Lucas spending her evenings in with Freud's Collected Works and an apple. It isn't her style even if in some quarters, reading psycho-analytic literature has become almost mandatory for the theoretically inclined artist and critic. Her works, currently installed at the Freud Museum in Hampstead, do not give you the feeling that she is either paying homage to Freud and Freudian thought, or contesting or illustrating Freud's ideas - even if there are works here with titles like Hysterical Attack and Beyond the Pleasure Principle. </p> <p>As much as her titles lead us to Freud, they lead us to thoughts of sex and death, to the self and its images. For Lucas, this is nothing new. But it must be said that the Freud Museum show is, in almost every respect, an advance on works that she recently presented in the Fag Show at the London gallery Sadie Coles HQ. </p> <p>Art relates to art as much as it does to the person who makes it. I look at Lucas's objects in the Freud Museum and, as much as I'm led back to Freud and the years I spent on someone's couch, I'm reminded of Hans Bellmer's terrifying dolls, of Louise Bourgeois's contorted torsos and a whole gamut of artists who, like Lucas, use and reuse commonplace objects. Looking at her work, you can be stultified by its obviousness. But then it hangs around in your head. Look again, and it gets more complex, more rich, less funny and more tart and painful. Lucas's work has, at its best, a terrible pathos, cloaked in a crass, knockabout, very English humour. </p> <p>There is something unmentionable in the room on the right at the top of the stairs. A cabinet of curios and Freudian mementos stands against one wall. There's a sofa and a desk in the room, and in the middle of the carpet a horrendous agglomeration of things: a strip light piercing a half-suspended red mattress. Globe lights dangle from the fluorescent tube, like cartoon testicles. The glowing strip-light rears up at an equally schematic woman, sketched in by a bucket (a red light illuminating its interior) and light-bulb breasts. Everything is held precariously in place, as if put together in a great hurry. Down on the floor, the mattress flops over a cardboard coffin. This ghastly arrangement would be puerile, if it weren't so hilarious, if it weren't so lively. </p> <p>Down in the dining room, two of the chairs have been turned into human surrogates. One chair sits on the oak table, a bra and panties stretched over the back and the seat, big globe light bulbs filling the bra. The second chair wears vest and Y-fronts, from which emerges another strip light, angled up and under the chair on the table. Let's do it on the table, one half of the work seems to say. Don't put me on a pedestal, says the other half. It is all very rumbustious and absurd: all that striving, all that posing, all that getting it up and getting it down. The language of sex and the language of sculpture aren't so very different - it is all about mistaking one object for another, being alert to the rightness and wrongness of things. </p> <p>In the inner sanctum of Freud's consulting room Lucas has placed two extruded figures, made from papier-mache and covered in pictures of mouths and eyes snipped from newspapers and magazines. They grow out of two kitchen chairs. They're hopeless, headless creatures, but great sculptures. They make me want to shriek - look how sensitively they grow from the chair-backs, how nastily elegant they are as forms. \"It's a Vagina Dentata!\" I remember Brian Sewell yelling when he was on Derek Jameson's couch with Michael Winner in the early days of Sky TV. </p> <p> Behind Freud's famous couch, with its covering of old brocade and the inviting, plumped-up cushions, Lucas has installed a huge blown-up photograph of herself. Like the two figures in the room, she is headless, and the photo is a close-up of her T-shirt. There's a ragged hole in the shirt, near the neck. Another, neatly hemmed peep-hole reveals her nipple. Imagine lying on the couch, mumbling on to the good doctor, while staring at the wall, and finding there images of breasts, gaping holes, rended fabric, maternal and masturbatory fantasy images. And all the while drivelling on for the full 50 minutes, the doctor going \"Hmmmn\" behind the serried ranks of figurines perched on his desk. </p> <p>You can't analyse the artist through the things they make, although it is often amusing to try. Artists are sly. Artists tell lies, artists are self-mythologists. The things they make inevitably have a bearing on their inner lives - and vice versa - but the relationship is a slippery one. What leads us to look, and to look again, you might ask, if not our our own desires? Lucas's exhibition is both highly theatrical and very much a sculpture show. She really does have a feel for materials, for placement, for throwing ideas in the air and keeping them suspended. She might be running amok in this dead Viennese household, but at least she's keeping things alive - like a hysteric, like a child. </p> <p>\u0095 Beyond the Pleasure Principle: Sarah Lucas is at the Freud Museum, London NW3, till April 12.
