But, like other efforts from David Holdsworth, Brian Hughes and Grainger, the shot did not trouble Russell Hoult. </p> <p>In the visitor's only first-half attack of menace after a bright start in which they laid siege to the City goal, Lee Bradbury was similarly wayward after a long throw by Hoult and a Rowett slip put him clear of the Blue's defence. </p> <p>Trevor Francis, never afraid to use the tactical substitution, opted for the kitchen-sink approach in the second period in an attempt to convert dominance into goals. Marcelo came on for Lazaridis to give City three strikers and Pompey's three centre-backs were still coming to terms with the change when the Brazilian striker latched on to O'Connor's diagonal pass into the penalty area, cut inside his marker and fired past Hoult with the outside of his right foot. </p> <p>He might have engineered a second goal when Adrian Whitbread bundled him over in the area but the referee Scott Mathieson was satisfied with the challenge.</p>",

Pompey, who had wonat Ipswich on Saturday, fielded their new signings Kevin Harper and Justin Edinburgh but not Colin Calderwood, whose supposed move from Aston Villa collapsed because the player failed to agree personal terms. Had he played, his first touch could hardly have been more inauspicious than that of Edinburgh, his former Tottenham team-mate, whose opening act was to chop down Andrew Johnson. He escaped with a warning. Johnson's feint is always likely to induce a false move from defenders but it was his predatory instinct in front of goal that caused Pompey most anxiety. The England under-18 international completed City's best move of the first half when he volleyed over from close range after a back-heel from Martin O'Connor had set up Stan Lazaridis for a left-wing cross. Johnson also went close with an acrobatic over-head kick after Martin Grainger headed on Gary Rowett's long throw. But, like other efforts from David Holdsworth, Brian Hughes and Grainger, the shot did not trouble Russell Hoult. In the visitor's only first-half attack of menace after a bright start in which they laid siege to the City goal, Lee Bradbury was similarly wayward after a long throw by Hoult and a Rowett slip put him clear of the Blue's defence. Trevor Francis, never afraid to use the tactical substitution, opted for the kitchen-sink approach in the second period in an attempt to convert dominance into goals. Marcelo came on for Lazaridis to give City three strikers and Pompey's three centre-backs were still coming to terms with the change when the Brazilian striker latched on to O'Connor's diagonal pass into the penalty area, cut inside his marker and fired past Hoult with the outside of his right foot. He might have engineered a second goal when Adrian Whitbread bundled him over in the area but the referee Scott Mathieson was satisfied with the challenge.",

Earlier this season they sailed through their opening Champions League games while their domestic form fell apart. Now they have ghosted up to third in the Premiership while their European form is starting to fray at the edges. </p> <p>Another problem for Vialli is the form of his \u00a33m midfielder Didier Deschamps, who was substituted after 62 muted minutes last week and was not even on the bench for Saturday's win at Newcastle. </p> <p>In typically diplomatic fashion Vialli played down suggestions that the 31-year-old was in the doghouse. \"Someone who gives everything each time he plays needs a rest every now and then,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I understand that people don't know him as well as I do. Maybe they expect more skill and more elegance from a midfielder who captains France.

      "bodyText": "If anyone doubted that Chelsea are a team with a split personality, the fact was comically underlined by the post-match analysis of last Tuesday's 1-0 defeat in Marseille. \"Our performance was good,\" argued the manager Gianluca Vialli. \"Apart from the result I'm quite pleased.\" \"It was a very, very poor display,\" countered the coach Graham Rix. \"Our passing was poor and so was our crossing.\" Of course, Vialli was merely doling out the banal propaganda that has marked his interviews of late, whereas the Yorkshireman in Rix preferred straight talking. But the fact remains that Chelsea performances are infuriatingly good and bad. Earlier this season they sailed through their opening Champions League games while their domestic form fell apart. Now they have ghosted up to third in the Premiership while their European form is starting to fray at the edges. Another problem for Vialli is the form of his \u00a33m midfielder Didier Deschamps, who was substituted after 62 muted minutes last week and was not even on the bench for Saturday's win at Newcastle. In typically diplomatic fashion Vialli played down suggestions that the 31-year-old was in the doghouse. \"Someone who gives everything each time he plays needs a rest every now and then,\" he said. \"I understand that people don't know him as well as I do. Maybe they expect more skill and more elegance from a midfielder who captains France. But I look at how effective he can be, not how elegant he is or how many good passes he makes.\" However, the impression remains that Vialli was making a point to Deschamps on Saturday and that tonight the Frenchman will be recalled to see if it has sunk in. Marcel Desailly is expected to recover from a knee injury in time to play tonight but Roberto di Matteo and Jon Harley both face fitness tests. \u0095 Leeds will play Slavia Prague in the Uefa Cup quarter-finals if they get through against Roma tomorrow. The Czechs lost 2-1 at Udinese yesterday but, 2-2 on aggregate, went through on the away goal. Chelsea (4-4-2, probable): De Goey; Ferrer, Desailly (or Lambourde), Leboeuf, Harley (or Babayaro); Petrescu, Wise, Deschamps, Poyet; Zola, Flo.

Since the early 1970s, it has sent trained volunteers to families struggling with everything from domestic violence, depression, ill-health and loneliness to coping with triplets. Any family with under-5s finding it difficult to cope can ask for help from the scheme. </p> <p>There are currently 260 Home-Start schemes helping 17,000 families, including families of British forces in Cyprus and Germany. With prevention at the top of the government's social exclusion agenda, the charity plans to help twice as many and double in size over the next five years. Home-Start volunteers are needed everywhere, says director Brian Waller, who wants to see a scheme in every community around the UK. </p> <p>The type of work volunteers are asked to do varies with the family and the area. </p> <p>On the surface, leafy Richmond, in London, seems an unlikely place for a family support scheme, but there is plenty of work for volunteers here too, says the local Home-Start scheme organiser, Anthea Cameron. Pockets of deprivation are hidden among the large, expensive houses. And while most of her work is with people on low incomes, she says that \"depression and isolation still exist in comfortable, middle class homes\". </p> <p>Waller admits that the charity has hidden its light under a bushel: Home-Start claims to support nearly three times as many under-fives as Barnardo's, a charity that has six times the income. But the organisation sits perfectly within the government's Sure Start programme, which aims to change the outcomes for young children in poor families. </p> <p>Under the Home-Start scheme, trained volunteers from the local community, who have all had parenting experience themselves, offer their services to families under stress. </p> <p>Help ranges from providing someone to talk to to offering a spare pair of hands to cope with difficult children or household tasks. Most families are referred to Home-Start by health visitors, some by local authorities; one in 10 refers itself. </p> <p>The charity is not a home help or childminding service, Waller emphasises, and volunteers are not there to tell people how to bring up their children. \"But because they have all been there themselves, they know how to deal with colic, sleepless nights and all the other pressures,\" he says. </p> <p>In one family helped by the Richmond scheme, the father's depression had turned the mother into \"a physical wreck\", says one volunteer. \"She was so isolated and desperate for someone to talk to. The first couple of times I went we talked about everything but her problems. I'd take her for a drive or a walk, just getting her out. Occasionally, I'd pick up the children from playgroup or help get them to school. </p> <p>\"Eventually, when she saw that I wasn't there to judge, she opened up. Over the year, I saw her getting physically stronger and more capable and confident in her ability to cope.\" </p> <p>Volunteer applicants undergo a 10-week preparation course that sets out the schemes' expectations and helps organisers weed out those who are unsuitable. </p> <p>Once accepted, the volunteers are carefully matched with families, but occasionally some drop out. \"It can be hard to put your own feelings to one side and suspend judgment,\" says one Richmond volunteer. </p> <p>According to Waller, the need for Home-Start has grown as pressures on family life have increased. \"In the past, when society was smaller and more intimate, the kind of help our volunteers provide may have been available more easily,\" he says. \"Now we provide the friendship that an extended family would have done.\" </p> <p>Ministers have said they would like to see a Home-Start scheme in every Sure Start area, and it's not hard to see why. It is a lean organisation, with only 10 staff at head office. And while the local scheme organisers and administrators around the country are paid, the volunteers receive only expenses. Home-Start is looking to the government to stump up the cash to expand the service. But will getting into bed with the government result in the organisation losing the independence it values so highly? Waller thinks not. \"Even when we're funded by the local authority, we work to the families' agenda not that of the social services department,\" he says. </p> <p>Waller admits that recruiting volunteers is more difficult than when the charity began, but he says: \"It is possible to find people willing to volunteer everywhere. There is goodwill and altruism in every part of the community - and 10% of families go on to be volunteers themselves.\" </p> <p>\"Part of the reward is to see the families getting better,\" says one volunteer. \"Many of the volunteers stay firm friends with the families even after the visits are no longer needed.\" And, Cameron adds: \"Some volunteers find the experience so empowering that they make changes to their own lives, such as enrolling on a course.\" </p> <p>Waller, a former director of social services, believes that Home-Start can reduce the likelihood of family breakdown and even child abuse. A study of 17 Scottish schemes found that health, parental self-esteem and behavioural problems in children improved after Home-Start visits. More research is planned to evaluate which approach works best. </p> <p>The volunteers say how much the women brighten up as their self-esteem increases. With a boosted confidence, they make better use of local clinics and support groups. This, in turn, has a positive, long-term impact on the children.</p>",

This was plotted 131 years ago when the government's schools inquiry commission declared that there was no reason to encourage \"indiscriminate gratuituous instruction\", an idea that they compared in its mischief to the indiscriminate donation of alms to beggars. They proposed an ingenious reform, which was rapidly adopted by parliament. </p> <p>They would seize the schools that then provided a free education for the poor in many towns and (ignoring the statutes that had established them) they would abolish them, and then (defying the lawful wishes of their benefactors), they would take over the endowments that had been left over the years to fund them and use the money to set up schools not for the poor but \" for the extension of middle-class education\". This was a bold idea, for which the commissioners received much credit, but, in truth, it was not an original one. </p> <p>For several centuries, the masters of the great public schools had been enriching their institutions by the same device. All of these schools were founded for the free education of the poor - that is why they were originally called public schools. When Henry VI founded Eton in 1442, for example, he instructed that \"no one having a yearly income of more than five marks shall be eligible\". In 1382, the founder of Winchester, William of Wykeham, declared that the school was to be made up of 70 \"poor and needy\" pupils, although as a concession to those whose patronage he sought, he agreed also to take 10 \"sons of noble and influential persons\". Rugby, Harrow and Westminster were founded as free schools for the poor. And yet, all of them eventually were hijacked by the wealthy, who paid fees to attend. The headmasters were happy to take their money and were quite clever in helping the hijack. </p> <p>Thomas Arnold preserved Rugby for the rich by closing its free lower school so that, unless the children of the poor could afford to pay someone else to teach them, they could not learn enough to get into the main school. The schools insisted that new pupils should be able to speak Latin, with the same result. At Harrow, the head man took the register at noon when the poorer pupils, who were day boys, were all at home for lunch and, just to make sure of their absence, he forbade them from riding horses to speed up their journey home. Westminster wriggled out of its legal obligation to the poor by arguing that Elizabeth I had never confirmed its statutes. Winchester justified its behaviour to the 1818 Brougham commission by explaining that, in truth, its current pupils really were poor; it was only their parents who were rich. </p> <p>With the public schools act of 1868, these ancient schools completed the theft by capturing any remaining endowments that were still dedicated to poor pupils. A year later, following the lead of the schools inquiry commission, the endowed schools act organised a far grander larceny, seizing from towns all over the country a fortune in endowments which had been left for the benefit of the local poor but which were now used to pay for a network of new fee-paying private schools for the middle class. </p> <p>Now, look at the story of Britain's schools during the last 20 years. From poisoned roots, a mighty structure has grown: 2,300 private schools with an annual income from fees of some \u00a33.2bn, educating nearly 600,000 pupils, a magnificent 7%of the nation's children. This remains the most unusual feature of the educational landscape of Britain. </p> <p>Other countries allow private schools, and some educate far more in private schools (17% in France, 13% in Denmark). However, apart from small pockets of privilege, invariably these are religious schools, such as those in France or Italy, or \"free\" schools such as those in Denmark, often underfunded and relying on state subsidy to survive. There is no other country in Europe where private schools present a fully fledged alternative to the state system, open essentially only to the affluent. </p> <p>Does that matter? In the first instance, it is a question of power. Stephen Pollard and Andrew Adonis, now a Downing Street adviser, recorded in their book A Class Act that, on the latest available figures, the magnificent 7% accounted for: seven out of nine senior generals; 33 out of 39 most senior judges; more than 120 of the 180 officers graduating from Sandhurst; half of the 18 permanent secretaries running Whitehall; and just under half of the 94 grade-three civil servants then aged under 50. Research for the Economic and Social Research Council found that 75% of private school pupils went on to take professional or managerial jobs. From the state schools, only 40% reached that level. </p> <p><strong> Politics marginalised</strong></p> <p>This question of power, and of social justice, has ceased to be fashionable, largely because the politics that kept the question alive have been marginalised. However, in a pragmatic age, an equally pressing version of the question remains - a purely educational one: does the existence of private schools have any impact on the educational performance of the mainstream state system? Can we relax and allow the two systems to enjoy a peaceful co-existence? Or is there some kind of destructive friction between the two? The answer is not quite what you might expect. </p> <p>Consider, for example, the hiring and firing of teachers. Simon Szreter, an economic historian at St John's College, Cambridge,found that in the last 20 years, Britain had fallen behind just about every other developed country in its investment in teachers for the state sector. Meanwhile, the private schools had forged ahead. </p> <p>All through the 1970s, Szreter found, both state schools and private schools were hiring extra teachers: the combined efforts of the Heath, Wilson and Callaghan governments put an extra 100,000 teachers on the payroll, with state schools closing the gap on private schools. At the beginning of the decade, the average state class contained 26 children; by 1979, it contained only 19. In private schools, the pupil-teacher ratio was about 50% lower - and the average of 19 disguised a mass of state classes of more than 30, sometimes more than 40, but the state sector was clearly catching up. Then Margaret Thatcher took over. </p> <p>By demographic chance, in the 1980s pupil numbers started to fall, in both private and state schools, but, while the private sector continued to invest in more teachers, the new Conservative administration took advantage of the falling pupil numbers to get rid of them in state schools. Half of the extra teachers who had been hired in the 1970s were removed from the payroll. Szreter found that all Britain's main economic competitors had continued to invest heavily in teachers. \"By 1991, the best of continental countries were running a ratio of between 10 and 12 pupils per teacher,\" he reported. In the early 1990s, only four of the 25 most developed nations had larger classes than Britain - Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea - and Szreter suspects that when the figures are finally brought up to date, they may well all have left Britain behind. \"No other democratically elected government in the modern world has dreamed up this masterstroke of actually disinvesting in the educational resources of the nation,\" he said. </p> <p>In the meantime, the private schools had continued hiring and re-established their superiority, with average classes containing only 10 pupils, nearly half the state schools' 19. Szreter estimates that to regain a position where the state school classes are only 50% larger than private ones, the government would need to hire 100,000 new teachers. </p> <p>Clearly, there is real unfairness in this. And yet, that does not, on the face of it, entitle us to blame the private schools. Where is the evidence that this mass shedding of teachers happened because there was a system of private schools over the fence and not simply because a Tory government was intent on cutting public spending to fund tax cuts? The cuts were part of a wider picture of encroaching financial hardship. Although the Tories often increased spending on education, they invariably failed to provide enough cash to keep pace with inflation and pupil numbers and, in spite of protests from parents and teachers, they allowed the real-terms funding of state schools to shrink. </p> <p>The London borough of Ealing's director of education, Alan Parker, reconstructed what happened. The borough protected its schools and cut the support services: eight education welfare officers were lost; the education psychology service was cut to the point where it could do little more than prepare statements to get funding for children with special needs; teachers of English as a foreign language were halved. Then the borough had to cut adult education - grants went only for those on income support who chose to pursue one of a narrow range of vocational courses. The youth service was cut by 50%. Arts, libaries and museums, too. Routine maintenance of buildings fell to zero. Then the cuts reached inside the schools - no more tuition in music, larger classes, less administrative support, less for books, less for classroom equipment, less for materials. </p> <p>Our survey of local education authorities produced similar accounts from all over the country. State schools found themselves caught in a pincer, compelled by law to teach the national curriculum, but compelled by cuts to reduce their service. The result was a cutback in music, sport, French in primary schools, libraries, special schools, outdoor centres - anything that was not protected by law. </p> <p>In one year of John Major's spending limits, the London borough of Merton, which had drawn some \u00a330m out of reserves, had to cut education by \u00a34.7m. Hammersmith, in west London, has had to cut its budget for schools every year for the last six years, taking a total of \u00a32.5m. Derbyshire has lost teachers in each of the last eight years, a total of 1,361. </p> <p>When Ofsted inspected Northumberland LEA recently, it found that the council's income had fallen in real terms every year from 1992 to 1998 and schools had suffered an 11% cut in budgets while central spending on education had been cut by 36%. Since the late 1980s, budgets for secondary schools in Cheshire have fallen in real terms by 6%; student awards were cut from \u00a39m to only \u00a3500,000; adult education has been cut by 30%. Staffordshire education had to cut \u00a39m. And on and on. </p> <p>During this long period of attrition Mrs Thatcher explained: \"I do not care what people's background is, where they come from. I want them to have the same opportunities, I want to get totally rid of class distinction.\" </p> <p>By 1991, 2,000 state schools were contacting the BBC's Children In Need project for money to repair buildings and hire more teachers. </p> <p>The private schools, however, were doing well with a very healthy subsidy from the state. Despite protests from the Labour party, the Conservative government continued to allow many to enjoy charity status. </p> <p>This meant that they escaped all tax on income from stocks, shares, trusts and property as well as escaping all VAT, corporation tax on their profit, capital gains tax and stamp duty on their property transactions, inheritance tax on their new endowments and up to 100% of their business rates. </p> <p><strong> Charity benefit</strong><br> </p> <p> In 1996, the Independent Schools Council surveyed 838 of its members and concluded that they were saving \u00a362.6m a year. In 1992, however, the master of Haileybury, David Jewell, suggested that ending charitable status would add 30% to fees - making charitable status the equivalent of a state subsidy of about \u00a31,945 per pupil and some \u00a3200 a year more than the state now invests in the education of a child at primary school. </p> <p>The private schools also continued to benefit from ministry of defence and foreign office fees for the children of some personnel, currently \u00a372m and \u00a312.5m a year. Arguably, universities benefit with almost 90% of private pupils going on to higher education, more than 20% of all university entrants. </p> <p>All this subsidy was already in place when Mrs Thatcher became prime minister. However, in 1981 she introduced a new and even more lucrative form of support, the assisted places scheme which paid the fees of up to 36,000 pupils a year, thus providing the private schools with a guaranteed income from the state of nearly \u00a3900m during the Conservative years. In this way, new money flowed through the same old channels that had been dug more than 100 years earlier - from the education of the poor towards the well-to-do. </p> <p>This financial aid was only one part of the bounty bestowed on private sector schools. There was a time when these two systems were in effect sealed off from each other as each generation of children divided to follow the footsteps of its parents but the Thatcher era saw the growth in schools of the One Big Market. Because the spending cuts were hurting the performance and reputation of state schools; because the income from fees and state subsidy was pushing the private schools still further ahead; because the Conservatives were cutting tax and putting more money into middle-class pockets, enabling them to buy their way into private schools; because private schools saw that it was financially and politically wise to invest in a wider range of pupils; because Kenneth Baker gave parents the right to choose state schools for their children; and because he then ordered that the funding should follow the children into the most popular schools, thus further damaging the reputation and performance of \"failing\" schools - for all these reasons the number of children in private schools began to rise. </p> <p>When Mrs Thatcher came to power, only 5.8% of the nation's children were in the private sector; by the time she left, the number had risen to 7%. In Greater London, 12% of the children were in private schools. There was no doubt about where these children were coming from: according to the ISC, most parents who send their children to private schools were themselves educated in the state sector. In many other ways, the two sectors of schooling remained separate; there were still many pupils who were born into one sector and could not conceive of entering the other; but in the centre, in this commercial sense, the private schools and the state schools had been pulled together, in competition with each other in the market for pupils. </p> <p>To reinforce the trend, the Conservatives encouraged state schools to opt out of LEA control, taking extra funds to become grant maintained schools with the power to select their intake. </p> <p>As all this evidence unfolds, a clearer answer begins to emerge to the question of co-existence. No other country in Europe has a fully fledged alternative to its state schools. No other country in Europe \"disinvested\" in its state schools. </p> <p>And what about the people who were responsible for this disinvestment? Ministers increased the size of state classes and sent their own children to private schools that had spent a small fortune cutting the size of their classes. This is not simply a point about jealousy: it is a point about politics. </p> <p>In his book We Should Know Better, the former Tory education minister, George Walden, argues with considerable authority that Britain's state schools have suffered persistent negligence because the power elite has had no interest in protecting them. He writes: \"The screening out of the sons and daughters of the affluent and influential severs our educational culture at the neck.\" </p> <p>In this crucial sense, the history of Britain's education is about the private sector actively damaging the state sector, by providing for the children of the rich and powerful with only the most meagre political protection for state schools. In this sense, the co-existence never has been peaceful. Beyond this, the creation of the One Big Market now has introduced a second and equally important kind of damage: on a scale that they have never achieved before, the private schools are skimming bright children off the top of the state system. </p> <p>Seven years ago, the national commission for education spotted the underlying trend in Britain's schools: the gap between the best and the worst. \"The gulf in outcomes between our best schools and our worst is big, much bigger than in most countries,\" it said. </p> <p>\"The OECD found that differences between English schools in levels of mathematical achievement were far larger than in any of the 10 other countries studied, including Scotland, with the single exception of Switzerland.\" </p> <p>That commission specifically warned about the potential damage caused by Kenneth Baker's introduction, five years earlier, of an effective market in school places. We described in the first part of this series how those reforms had created a two-tier system of state schools, the successful school in the affluent suburb attracting more and more motivated, middle-class pupils, and more and more funds; while the failing school down the road became a ghetto, starved of motivated children, penalised with the loss of funds. Every time a government boosts the private schools, it reinforces that process of polarisation. The fact that the private schools run explicitly on a system of academic selection means that there is no ambiguity at all about what is happening (in the way that there may be some marginal ambiguity with the middle-class state school): they are taking the brightest children. Which, in itself, adds another twist to the polarisation, by advancing their own academic results and depressing those of the state. </p> <p>As a single example, take Bedfordshire, where according to county councillor Tony Mitchell, 12% of the county's brightest children are skimmed off by four private schools in the Harpur Trust. \"In the heyday of the grammar school, a county like Essex selected only 6% of the ability range.\" In addition, the Conservatives' grant-maintained schools, with extra funding from LEAs, select pupils and skim a further 27% of Bedfordshire children. \"Some schools, all in areas of disadvantage, are threatened with closure while one GM school has 54% of its pupils from outside its catchment area.\" </p> <p>Yet this is not quite the end of the argument. Events have moved on. The year after George Walden wrote his book, New Labour came to power and it dealt private schools two painful body blows. One of David Blunkett's first steps as education secretary was to kill off the assisted places scheme, worth an annual \u00a3134.4m to the private schools. Mr Blunkett was sued in the high court, was heavily criticised but stuck to the policy. Then he introduced tuition fees in university. It hurt almost all potential students - and it hurt the private schools by diverting some of the parental cash that might otherwise have gone into private sixth-forms. </p> <p>There are now signs of struggle in the private sector. The Independent Schools Council reported last year that the number of children at its schools had increased by 0.71%, but that disguised the real trend. The increase consists entirely of a surge in children going to private nurseries while the numbers taking both GCSEs and A-levels has started to fall. More than that, there has been a steady and ultimately drastic fall in the flow of the most lucrative pupils, the boarders: in 1983, 27.7% of ISC pupils were boarders; last year, it was only 14.9%. Last year alone, the number of boarders fell by 4.3%. </p> <p>Last summer, the City accountant PriceWaterhouseCooper reported that scores of private schools were likely to close in the next decade. Its survey indicated that 13% of schools were running a deficit. Richard Davison of the ISC said: \"It is a free market and the weaker schools are going. Once you move away from the top schools, it is brutal.\" </p> <p>There are some deepy troubled private schools, suffering with an intake of poorly motivated children and very low fees. Ofsted's annual report in 1997/8 pointed out that while 10% of private schools see every single pupil scoring at least five A to C grades at GCSE, there are 5% of private schools who cannot score a single A to C grade for any of their pupils. That year, they inspected only 411 private schools, but 60 of them \"caused considerable concern\". </p> <p><strong> Public appeals</strong><br> </p> <p> School inspectors reported: \"Only one teacher has qualified teacher status; classrooms are unsafe and unhealthy and so unfit for the education of children; excessive shouting at children; overall the quality of education is poor; the air of decay; the lack of resources; low paid teachers\" </p> <p>A survey by the market research group Mintel last year found that in the previous year, fees had risen by 5.2% while inflation was only 3.3%. Some schools have launched financial appeals and others are investing in computer and sports facilities. </p> <p>Where once private schools marketed themselves by sending the headteacher to preach in an outside church, the big private players are now playing the market game professionally. Two hundred and eighty private schools have formed the Association of Development Directors in Independent Schools. Their chair, Felicity Rutland, said: \"Marketing professionals are no longer a luxury, they are key members of the school's management team.\" </p> <p>In theory, the Blair government might have continued to defend the state schools. But in terms of their funding, the disparity between private and state remains breathtaking. Last year, ISC found that their schools were charging on average \u00a35,460 for a year, while state schools were receiving from all sources an average of only \u00a32,372 per pupil. To put it another way: setting aside tax breaks and other subsidies, pupils in state schools are receiving only 44% of the funding that is enjoyed by private school pupils. Bear in mind also that some of the most successful private schools receive a considerable income from investments and property which they can add to their income from fees, so that a school such as Eton can spend some \u00a320,000 per year on each of its pupils. </p> <p>In contrast to the scything cuts in music, French and sport in the state primary schools, a survey last year by the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools found that 93% of private prep schools teach music; almost all teach French; two thirds teach Latin; a quarter teach German; one in seven teach Spanish; and they enjoy an average of 18.3 acres of land. Since 1981, state schools have been forced to sell more than 5,000 playing fields; although Labour promised to end the sale, they are still being sold off at a rate of about 20 a year. </p> <p>While private schools had been installing computers and linking them to the internet and their own internal intranets, the state primary schools in 1998 were providing only one computer for every 18 pupils; only 17% of them were linked to the internet. In secondary schools there was one computer between nine pupils. In an attempt to catch up, Mr Blunkett invested \u00a3310m in the National Grid for Learning and saw the figures start to climb in 1999. The end result of all this is a system on the edge of despair. </p> <p>Since Mr Blunkett's claim to be spending an extra \u00a319bn has collapsed in empty rhetoric, many state schools have turned to parents to raise money. </p> <p>Teachers, too, have become funders: the Association of Teachers and Lecturers found that half their members had dug into their own pockets to buy resources for the literacy hour. </p> <p>Corporations, sensing an opportunity, have moved to fill the gap. But many, such as Cadbury's and McDonald's, promote their own products. </p> <p>The old maxim that Britain's state schools are centrally funded but locally delivered is collapsing: first, under the weight of the standards fund, which means that almost all spare cash is being directed from the centre; and, secondly, under a torrent of central instruction and criticism. </p> <p>Giving evidence to the select committee on education, Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, contemptuously dismissed the idea that state teachers were suffering from a lack of resources. \"They blame the government for a lack of resources, they blame parents for not producing intelligent enough pupils, and they blame the collapse of western civilisation as we know it.\" This was on November 3 1999. Six months earlier, the headmaster of Winchester, James Sabben-Clare, told the Daily Telegraph that if independent schools were restricted to spending an average of \u00a32,300 a year per pupil, as state schools are, the quality of education they could offer would be greatly diminished. Fees at Winchester run at \u00a315,000 a year. </p> <p>Few other businesses are marketed by managers who publicly denounce their product; attack their staff; savage their local managers; and sing the praises of the competition. </p> <p>No other organisation in the country is managed with the kind of organised public exposure experienced by schools and local education authorities. It is doubtful whether any other organisation - corporate boardroom, factory floor, legal chambers, newsroom - could survive that kind of scrutiny and denunciation. There are drunkards in alleys with a better strategy for self-advertisement. </p> <p>All this means that the state schools remain highly vulnerable to the private schools they are now encouraged to see as partners. The answer to the question of co-existence is that purely in educational terms, the private schools continue to inflict damage on the state sector, draining away political interest and bright pupils. Why does the department of education not do more to protect them? </p> <p>Mr Walden blamed some of the department's problems on low-calibre civil servants. He argued that top-flight officials went off to the high-prestige departments such as the foreign office, leaving education in the hands of the also-rans: \"Able people have worked there, but on average the quality has not been commensurate with the importance of the work.\" The problem, however, surely goes deeper than a mere shortage of managerial flair. </p> <p>One of the battering rams used by critics to attack state schooling in the last 20 years has been a contempt for those who, in the words of Kenneth Baker, \"seek to use education for social engineering\". It is this that is held to have poisoned the well of state schooling by producing the comprehensive system. It is this perversion that is blamed for a \"levelling down\" in the classroom. </p> <p><strong> Control of education</strong><br> </p> <p> Now go back, for a moment, to the schools inquiry commission and look at its confident assertion that there was no justification for \"indiscriminate gratuitous instruction\". Well? Is there? The unemployed need no qualifications at all. Even skilled workers do not need A-levels, let alone university degrees. </p> <p>The Conservative and National governments of the 1920s and 1930s understood this and resisted all efforts by the Labour party to introduce universal secondary education and to raise the school leaving age. On the eve of the second world war, working class children in this country were still entitled only to elementary education to the age of 14; 10% of them managed to graduate into county grammar schools or direct grant schools, often paying fees. And that was it. </p> <p>The impetus to allow the working class into the higher reaches of education was and remains political and moral: it enables the workers not merely to work but to aspire to break out of their class and move upwards. In that sense, any move towards educating the working class is guilty of precisely the crime of which it is so frequently still accused by its conservative detractors - social engineering. If you deny the role of social justice in education, you remove any logical justification for universal schooling. For all its humanity and social justice, it makes no economic sense at all. Any sane treasury official, therefore, will resist it. Which is what they have done, very successfully. </p> <p>The ideology of partnership has silenced talk of social justice in New Labour's education policy and so, in one simple sweep of rhetoric, more than 100 years of development is left hanging. The point is not that the education department or its ministers are part of some conspiracy to undermine the state schools. The truth rather is that, in an age of pragmatism, they have lost their politics and so they have no basis on which to fight a battle for public opinion to explain that they cannot fund a revival in state schools without raising taxes. </p> <p>They prefer to pretend that they have found the money, regardless of reality. In the same way, they will not challenge the received wisdom of the Conservative years but prefer to recycle the muddled half-truths of parental choice and funding formulae and Ofsted and league tables, offering no kind of leadership, no kind of insight, no kind of hope. And, in the meantime, the market continues to favour the strong. </p> <p>Martin Stephens, high master of Manchester grammar school, one of the private schools that commands most admiration from the government, told us: \"We have created a system of almost total confusion. It is basically a vision of chaos.\" </p> <p>Additional research by Helene Mulholland</p>",

      "bodyText": "Let us begin with the story of what the historian Brian Simon once described as \"probably the biggest hijack of public resources in history\". This was plotted 131 years ago when the government's schools inquiry commission declared that there was no reason to encourage \"indiscriminate gratuituous instruction\", an idea that they compared in its mischief to the indiscriminate donation of alms to beggars. They proposed an ingenious reform, which was rapidly adopted by parliament. They would seize the schools that then provided a free education for the poor in many towns and (ignoring the statutes that had established them) they would abolish them, and then (defying the lawful wishes of their benefactors), they would take over the endowments that had been left over the years to fund them and use the money to set up schools not for the poor but \" for the extension of middle-class education\". This was a bold idea, for which the commissioners received much credit, but, in truth, it was not an original one. For several centuries, the masters of the great public schools had been enriching their institutions by the same device. All of these schools were founded for the free education of the poor - that is why they were originally called public schools. When Henry VI founded Eton in 1442, for example, he instructed that \"no one having a yearly income of more than five marks shall be eligible\". In 1382, the founder of Winchester, William of Wykeham, declared that the school was to be made up of 70 \"poor and needy\" pupils, although as a concession to those whose patronage he sought, he agreed also to take 10 \"sons of noble and influential persons\". Rugby, Harrow and Westminster were founded as free schools for the poor. And yet, all of them eventually were hijacked by the wealthy, who paid fees to attend. The headmasters were happy to take their money and were quite clever in helping the hijack. Thomas Arnold preserved Rugby for the rich by closing its free lower school so that, unless the children of the poor could afford to pay someone else to teach them, they could not learn enough to get into the main school. The schools insisted that new pupils should be able to speak Latin, with the same result. At Harrow, the head man took the register at noon when the poorer pupils, who were day boys, were all at home for lunch and, just to make sure of their absence, he forbade them from riding horses to speed up their journey home. Westminster wriggled out of its legal obligation to the poor by arguing that Elizabeth I had never confirmed its statutes. Winchester justified its behaviour to the 1818 Brougham commission by explaining that, in truth, its current pupils really were poor; it was only their parents who were rich. With the public schools act of 1868, these ancient schools completed the theft by capturing any remaining endowments that were still dedicated to poor pupils. A year later, following the lead of the schools inquiry commission, the endowed schools act organised a far grander larceny, seizing from towns all over the country a fortune in endowments which had been left for the benefit of the local poor but which were now used to pay for a network of new fee-paying private schools for the middle class. Now, look at the story of Britain's schools during the last 20 years. From poisoned roots, a mighty structure has grown: 2,300 private schools with an annual income from fees of some \u00a33.2bn, educating nearly 600,000 pupils, a magnificent 7%of the nation's children. This remains the most unusual feature of the educational landscape of Britain. Other countries allow private schools, and some educate far more in private schools (17% in France, 13% in Denmark). However, apart from small pockets of privilege, invariably these are religious schools, such as those in France or Italy, or \"free\" schools such as those in Denmark, often underfunded and relying on state subsidy to survive. There is no other country in Europe where private schools present a fully fledged alternative to the state system, open essentially only to the affluent. Does that matter? In the first instance, it is a question of power. Stephen Pollard and Andrew Adonis, now a Downing Street adviser, recorded in their book A Class Act that, on the latest available figures, the magnificent 7% accounted for: seven out of nine senior generals; 33 out of 39 most senior judges; more than 120 of the 180 officers graduating from Sandhurst; half of the 18 permanent secretaries running Whitehall; and just under half of the 94 grade-three civil servants then aged under 50. Research for the Economic and Social Research Council found that 75% of private school pupils went on to take professional or managerial jobs. From the state schools, only 40% reached that level. Politics marginalised This question of power, and of social justice, has ceased to be fashionable, largely because the politics that kept the question alive have been marginalised. However, in a pragmatic age, an equally pressing version of the question remains - a purely educational one: does the existence of private schools have any impact on the educational performance of the mainstream state system? Can we relax and allow the two systems to enjoy a peaceful co-existence? Or is there some kind of destructive friction between the two? The answer is not quite what you might expect. Consider, for example, the hiring and firing of teachers. Simon Szreter, an economic historian at St John's College, Cambridge,found that in the last 20 years, Britain had fallen behind just about every other developed country in its investment in teachers for the state sector. Meanwhile, the private schools had forged ahead. All through the 1970s, Szreter found, both state schools and private schools were hiring extra teachers: the combined efforts of the Heath, Wilson and Callaghan governments put an extra 100,000 teachers on the payroll, with state schools closing the gap on private schools. At the beginning of the decade, the average state class contained 26 children; by 1979, it contained only 19. In private schools, the pupil-teacher ratio was about 50% lower - and the average of 19 disguised a mass of state classes of more than 30, sometimes more than 40, but the state sector was clearly catching up. Then Margaret Thatcher took over. By demographic chance, in the 1980s pupil numbers started to fall, in both private and state schools, but, while the private sector continued to invest in more teachers, the new Conservative administration took advantage of the falling pupil numbers to get rid of them in state schools. Half of the extra teachers who had been hired in the 1970s were removed from the payroll. Szreter found that all Britain's main economic competitors had continued to invest heavily in teachers. \"By 1991, the best of continental countries were running a ratio of between 10 and 12 pupils per teacher,\" he reported. In the early 1990s, only four of the 25 most developed nations had larger classes than Britain - Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea - and Szreter suspects that when the figures are finally brought up to date, they may well all have left Britain behind. \"No other democratically elected government in the modern world has dreamed up this masterstroke of actually disinvesting in the educational resources of the nation,\" he said. In the meantime, the private schools had continued hiring and re-established their superiority, with average classes containing only 10 pupils, nearly half the state schools' 19. Szreter estimates that to regain a position where the state school classes are only 50% larger than private ones, the government would need to hire 100,000 new teachers. Clearly, there is real unfairness in this. And yet, that does not, on the face of it, entitle us to blame the private schools. Where is the evidence that this mass shedding of teachers happened because there was a system of private schools over the fence and not simply because a Tory government was intent on cutting public spending to fund tax cuts? The cuts were part of a wider picture of encroaching financial hardship. Although the Tories often increased spending on education, they invariably failed to provide enough cash to keep pace with inflation and pupil numbers and, in spite of protests from parents and teachers, they allowed the real-terms funding of state schools to shrink. The London borough of Ealing's director of education, Alan Parker, reconstructed what happened. The borough protected its schools and cut the support services: eight education welfare officers were lost; the education psychology service was cut to the point where it could do little more than prepare statements to get funding for children with special needs; teachers of English as a foreign language were halved. Then the borough had to cut adult education - grants went only for those on income support who chose to pursue one of a narrow range of vocational courses. The youth service was cut by 50%. Arts, libaries and museums, too. Routine maintenance of buildings fell to zero. Then the cuts reached inside the schools - no more tuition in music, larger classes, less administrative support, less for books, less for classroom equipment, less for materials. Our survey of local education authorities produced similar accounts from all over the country. State schools found themselves caught in a pincer, compelled by law to teach the national curriculum, but compelled by cuts to reduce their service. The result was a cutback in music, sport, French in primary schools, libraries, special schools, outdoor centres - anything that was not protected by law. In one year of John Major's spending limits, the London borough of Merton, which had drawn some \u00a330m out of reserves, had to cut education by \u00a34.7m. Hammersmith, in west London, has had to cut its budget for schools every year for the last six years, taking a total of \u00a32.5m. Derbyshire has lost teachers in each of the last eight years, a total of 1,361. When Ofsted inspected Northumberland LEA recently, it found that the council's income had fallen in real terms every year from 1992 to 1998 and schools had suffered an 11% cut in budgets while central spending on education had been cut by 36%. Since the late 1980s, budgets for secondary schools in Cheshire have fallen in real terms by 6%; student awards were cut from \u00a39m to only \u00a3500,000; adult education has been cut by 30%. Staffordshire education had to cut \u00a39m. And on and on. During this long period of attrition Mrs Thatcher explained: \"I do not care what people's background is, where they come from. I want them to have the same opportunities, I want to get totally rid of class distinction.\" By 1991, 2,000 state schools were contacting the BBC's Children In Need project for money to repair buildings and hire more teachers. The private schools, however, were doing well with a very healthy subsidy from the state. Despite protests from the Labour party, the Conservative government continued to allow many to enjoy charity status. This meant that they escaped all tax on income from stocks, shares, trusts and property as well as escaping all VAT, corporation tax on their profit, capital gains tax and stamp duty on their property transactions, inheritance tax on their new endowments and up to 100% of their business rates. Charity benefit In 1996, the Independent Schools Council surveyed 838 of its members and concluded that they were saving \u00a362.6m a year. In 1992, however, the master of Haileybury, David Jewell, suggested that ending charitable status would add 30% to fees - making charitable status the equivalent of a state subsidy of about \u00a31,945 per pupil and some \u00a3200 a year more than the state now invests in the education of a child at primary school. The private schools also continued to benefit from ministry of defence and foreign office fees for the children of some personnel, currently \u00a372m and \u00a312.5m a year. Arguably, universities benefit with almost 90% of private pupils going on to higher education, more than 20% of all university entrants. All this subsidy was already in place when Mrs Thatcher became prime minister. However, in 1981 she introduced a new and even more lucrative form of support, the assisted places scheme which paid the fees of up to 36,000 pupils a year, thus providing the private schools with a guaranteed income from the state of nearly \u00a3900m during the Conservative years. In this way, new money flowed through the same old channels that had been dug more than 100 years earlier - from the education of the poor towards the well-to-do. This financial aid was only one part of the bounty bestowed on private sector schools. There was a time when these two systems were in effect sealed off from each other as each generation of children divided to follow the footsteps of its parents but the Thatcher era saw the growth in schools of the One Big Market. Because the spending cuts were hurting the performance and reputation of state schools; because the income from fees and state subsidy was pushing the private schools still further ahead; because the Conservatives were cutting tax and putting more money into middle-class pockets, enabling them to buy their way into private schools; because private schools saw that it was financially and politically wise to invest in a wider range of pupils; because Kenneth Baker gave parents the right to choose state schools for their children; and because he then ordered that the funding should follow the children into the most popular schools, thus further damaging the reputation and performance of \"failing\" schools - for all these reasons the number of children in private schools began to rise. When Mrs Thatcher came to power, only 5.8% of the nation's children were in the private sector; by the time she left, the number had risen to 7%. In Greater London, 12% of the children were in private schools. There was no doubt about where these children were coming from: according to the ISC, most parents who send their children to private schools were themselves educated in the state sector. In many other ways, the two sectors of schooling remained separate; there were still many pupils who were born into one sector and could not conceive of entering the other; but in the centre, in this commercial sense, the private schools and the state schools had been pulled together, in competition with each other in the market for pupils. To reinforce the trend, the Conservatives encouraged state schools to opt out of LEA control, taking extra funds to become grant maintained schools with the power to select their intake. As all this evidence unfolds, a clearer answer begins to emerge to the question of co-existence. No other country in Europe has a fully fledged alternative to its state schools. No other country in Europe \"disinvested\" in its state schools. And what about the people who were responsible for this disinvestment? Ministers increased the size of state classes and sent their own children to private schools that had spent a small fortune cutting the size of their classes. This is not simply a point about jealousy: it is a point about politics. In his book We Should Know Better, the former Tory education minister, George Walden, argues with considerable authority that Britain's state schools have suffered persistent negligence because the power elite has had no interest in protecting them. He writes: \"The screening out of the sons and daughters of the affluent and influential severs our educational culture at the neck.\" In this crucial sense, the history of Britain's education is about the private sector actively damaging the state sector, by providing for the children of the rich and powerful with only the most meagre political protection for state schools. In this sense, the co-existence never has been peaceful. Beyond this, the creation of the One Big Market now has introduced a second and equally important kind of damage: on a scale that they have never achieved before, the private schools are skimming bright children off the top of the state system. Seven years ago, the national commission for education spotted the underlying trend in Britain's schools: the gap between the best and the worst. \"The gulf in outcomes between our best schools and our worst is big, much bigger than in most countries,\" it said. \"The OECD found that differences between English schools in levels of mathematical achievement were far larger than in any of the 10 other countries studied, including Scotland, with the single exception of Switzerland.\" That commission specifically warned about the potential damage caused by Kenneth Baker's introduction, five years earlier, of an effective market in school places. We described in the first part of this series how those reforms had created a two-tier system of state schools, the successful school in the affluent suburb attracting more and more motivated, middle-class pupils, and more and more funds; while the failing school down the road became a ghetto, starved of motivated children, penalised with the loss of funds. Every time a government boosts the private schools, it reinforces that process of polarisation. The fact that the private schools run explicitly on a system of academic selection means that there is no ambiguity at all about what is happening (in the way that there may be some marginal ambiguity with the middle-class state school): they are taking the brightest children. Which, in itself, adds another twist to the polarisation, by advancing their own academic results and depressing those of the state. As a single example, take Bedfordshire, where according to county councillor Tony Mitchell, 12% of the county's brightest children are skimmed off by four private schools in the Harpur Trust. \"In the heyday of the grammar school, a county like Essex selected only 6% of the ability range.\" In addition, the Conservatives' grant-maintained schools, with extra funding from LEAs, select pupils and skim a further 27% of Bedfordshire children. \"Some schools, all in areas of disadvantage, are threatened with closure while one GM school has 54% of its pupils from outside its catchment area.\" Yet this is not quite the end of the argument. Events have moved on. The year after George Walden wrote his book, New Labour came to power and it dealt private schools two painful body blows. One of David Blunkett's first steps as education secretary was to kill off the assisted places scheme, worth an annual \u00a3134.4m to the private schools. Mr Blunkett was sued in the high court, was heavily criticised but stuck to the policy. Then he introduced tuition fees in university. It hurt almost all potential students - and it hurt the private schools by diverting some of the parental cash that might otherwise have gone into private sixth-forms. There are now signs of struggle in the private sector. The Independent Schools Council reported last year that the number of children at its schools had increased by 0.71%, but that disguised the real trend. The increase consists entirely of a surge in children going to private nurseries while the numbers taking both GCSEs and A-levels has started to fall. More than that, there has been a steady and ultimately drastic fall in the flow of the most lucrative pupils, the boarders: in 1983, 27.7% of ISC pupils were boarders; last year, it was only 14.9%. Last year alone, the number of boarders fell by 4.3%. Last summer, the City accountant PriceWaterhouseCooper reported that scores of private schools were likely to close in the next decade. Its survey indicated that 13% of schools were running a deficit. Richard Davison of the ISC said: \"It is a free market and the weaker schools are going. Once you move away from the top schools, it is brutal.\" There are some deepy troubled private schools, suffering with an intake of poorly motivated children and very low fees. Ofsted's annual report in 1997/8 pointed out that while 10% of private schools see every single pupil scoring at least five A to C grades at GCSE, there are 5% of private schools who cannot score a single A to C grade for any of their pupils. That year, they inspected only 411 private schools, but 60 of them \"caused considerable concern\". Public appeals School inspectors reported: \"Only one teacher has qualified teacher status; classrooms are unsafe and unhealthy and so unfit for the education of children; excessive shouting at children; overall the quality of education is poor; the air of decay; the lack of resources; low paid teachers\" A survey by the market research group Mintel last year found that in the previous year, fees had risen by 5.2% while inflation was only 3.3%. Some schools have launched financial appeals and others are investing in computer and sports facilities. Where once private schools marketed themselves by sending the headteacher to preach in an outside church, the big private players are now playing the market game professionally. Two hundred and eighty private schools have formed the Association of Development Directors in Independent Schools. Their chair, Felicity Rutland, said: \"Marketing professionals are no longer a luxury, they are key members of the school's management team.\" In theory, the Blair government might have continued to defend the state schools. But in terms of their funding, the disparity between private and state remains breathtaking. Last year, ISC found that their schools were charging on average \u00a35,460 for a year, while state schools were receiving from all sources an average of only \u00a32,372 per pupil. To put it another way: setting aside tax breaks and other subsidies, pupils in state schools are receiving only 44% of the funding that is enjoyed by private school pupils. Bear in mind also that some of the most successful private schools receive a considerable income from investments and property which they can add to their income from fees, so that a school such as Eton can spend some \u00a320,000 per year on each of its pupils. In contrast to the scything cuts in music, French and sport in the state primary schools, a survey last year by the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools found that 93% of private prep schools teach music; almost all teach French; two thirds teach Latin; a quarter teach German; one in seven teach Spanish; and they enjoy an average of 18.3 acres of land. Since 1981, state schools have been forced to sell more than 5,000 playing fields; although Labour promised to end the sale, they are still being sold off at a rate of about 20 a year. While private schools had been installing computers and linking them to the internet and their own internal intranets, the state primary schools in 1998 were providing only one computer for every 18 pupils; only 17% of them were linked to the internet. In secondary schools there was one computer between nine pupils. In an attempt to catch up, Mr Blunkett invested \u00a3310m in the National Grid for Learning and saw the figures start to climb in 1999. The end result of all this is a system on the edge of despair. Since Mr Blunkett's claim to be spending an extra \u00a319bn has collapsed in empty rhetoric, many state schools have turned to parents to raise money. Teachers, too, have become funders: the Association of Teachers and Lecturers found that half their members had dug into their own pockets to buy resources for the literacy hour. Corporations, sensing an opportunity, have moved to fill the gap. But many, such as Cadbury's and McDonald's, promote their own products. The old maxim that Britain's state schools are centrally funded but locally delivered is collapsing: first, under the weight of the standards fund, which means that almost all spare cash is being directed from the centre; and, secondly, under a torrent of central instruction and criticism. Giving evidence to the select committee on education, Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, contemptuously dismissed the idea that state teachers were suffering from a lack of resources. \"They blame the government for a lack of resources, they blame parents for not producing intelligent enough pupils, and they blame the collapse of western civilisation as we know it.\" This was on November 3 1999. Six months earlier, the headmaster of Winchester, James Sabben-Clare, told the Daily Telegraph that if independent schools were restricted to spending an average of \u00a32,300 a year per pupil, as state schools are, the quality of education they could offer would be greatly diminished. Fees at Winchester run at \u00a315,000 a year. Few other businesses are marketed by managers who publicly denounce their product; attack their staff; savage their local managers; and sing the praises of the competition. No other organisation in the country is managed with the kind of organised public exposure experienced by schools and local education authorities. It is doubtful whether any other organisation - corporate boardroom, factory floor, legal chambers, newsroom - could survive that kind of scrutiny and denunciation. There are drunkards in alleys with a better strategy for self-advertisement. All this means that the state schools remain highly vulnerable to the private schools they are now encouraged to see as partners. The answer to the question of co-existence is that purely in educational terms, the private schools continue to inflict damage on the state sector, draining away political interest and bright pupils. Why does the department of education not do more to protect them? Mr Walden blamed some of the department's problems on low-calibre civil servants. He argued that top-flight officials went off to the high-prestige departments such as the foreign office, leaving education in the hands of the also-rans: \"Able people have worked there, but on average the quality has not been commensurate with the importance of the work.\" The problem, however, surely goes deeper than a mere shortage of managerial flair. One of the battering rams used by critics to attack state schooling in the last 20 years has been a contempt for those who, in the words of Kenneth Baker, \"seek to use education for social engineering\". It is this that is held to have poisoned the well of state schooling by producing the comprehensive system. It is this perversion that is blamed for a \"levelling down\" in the classroom. Control of education Now go back, for a moment, to the schools inquiry commission and look at its confident assertion that there was no justification for \"indiscriminate gratuitous instruction\". Well? Is there? The unemployed need no qualifications at all. Even skilled workers do not need A-levels, let alone university degrees. The Conservative and National governments of the 1920s and 1930s understood this and resisted all efforts by the Labour party to introduce universal secondary education and to raise the school leaving age. On the eve of the second world war, working class children in this country were still entitled only to elementary education to the age of 14; 10% of them managed to graduate into county grammar schools or direct grant schools, often paying fees. And that was it. The impetus to allow the working class into the higher reaches of education was and remains political and moral: it enables the workers not merely to work but to aspire to break out of their class and move upwards. In that sense, any move towards educating the working class is guilty of precisely the crime of which it is so frequently still accused by its conservative detractors - social engineering. If you deny the role of social justice in education, you remove any logical justification for universal schooling. For all its humanity and social justice, it makes no economic sense at all. Any sane treasury official, therefore, will resist it. Which is what they have done, very successfully. The ideology of partnership has silenced talk of social justice in New Labour's education policy and so, in one simple sweep of rhetoric, more than 100 years of development is left hanging. The point is not that the education department or its ministers are part of some conspiracy to undermine the state schools. The truth rather is that, in an age of pragmatism, they have lost their politics and so they have no basis on which to fight a battle for public opinion to explain that they cannot fund a revival in state schools without raising taxes. They prefer to pretend that they have found the money, regardless of reality. In the same way, they will not challenge the received wisdom of the Conservative years but prefer to recycle the muddled half-truths of parental choice and funding formulae and Ofsted and league tables, offering no kind of leadership, no kind of insight, no kind of hope. And, in the meantime, the market continues to favour the strong. Martin Stephens, high master of Manchester grammar school, one of the private schools that commands most admiration from the government, told us: \"We have created a system of almost total confusion. It is basically a vision of chaos.\" Additional research by Helene Mulholland",

Of course men and women are not so fundamentally different as to choose entirely conflicting agendas - often it's about sensibility rather than gender, an occasional shift of emphasis rather than a complete change of subject. The possibilities raised by this initiative will be more fully explored by Worldwoman - an internet based newspaper and press agency written by women for women with contributions from all over the world. The notion is that women across the globe will contribute stories on every possible issue, sometimes local and sometimes global, which can then be adapted by women in other countries to suit their particular local interests. Of course, if all that activity doesn't appeal, you could always take the day off. Today groups of women worldwide will be striking for an end to no pay, low pay and too much work, demanding wages for all caring work, equal pay and paid maternity leave, as well as the abolition of third world debt, the burden of which falls heaviest on women. Issues of equal pay and parental leave have particularly exercised the women of Britain in the last couple of months. Research published earlier this year by the London School of Economics found that women forfeit up to \u00a3250,000 over a working lifetime simply because they are women. While women with children and women in part-time work are most heavily penalised, the bottom line remains that women lose out not because of lifestyle choice or educational disadvantage but simply because of their gender. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether the introduction of parental leave will have any serious impact while it continues to be unpaid. The Blair government's record on women has rightly been held up to close scrutiny, given the emphasis that Labour has placed on its ability to deliver on gender inequalities. And despite some significant successes - on childcare and the working family tax credit for example - it is telling that women within the government are still feeling marginalised by the predominantly male ethos of parliament. So what are we celebrating? The myriad of advances that have improved the lives of women, particularly in the developed world, over the past decade. But still, globally as well as locally, there is plenty to think about, today and every day.",

But it is more likely to be \"the old foot in a bucket of hot water syndrome,\" as he said during the last World Cup. With a life under the tanning warmth of TV studio lights, Ron could find the First Division's backwaters a bit of a shock to the system.</p> <p>However, big-hearted Ron has not ruled out mucking in: \"If someone did take over the job at Albion and wanted a bit of help I'd always be willing to give them that.\" Former Bolton boss Colin Todd, ex-Stoke supremo Gary Megson, Cheltenham coach Steve Cotterill and Kidderminster Harriers' Jan Molby are leading the race to join the Baggies.

But now it's just the Midlands, and quicker than you could say \"pop it to the big lad at the back stick\", Ron has been linked early doors with Brian Little's old job at West Brom. However, football's biggest walking talking stereotype has refused to return from retirement to run the club he managed twice before: \"When I left Nottingham Forest at the end of last season I said 'That's it' in terms of being a football manager, and my position hasn't changed,\" he said. Perhaps West Brom could not support the man whose catastrophic salary drop after being fired by Manchester United in the Eighties left him saying: \"I've had to swap my Merc for a BMW, I'm down to my last 37 suits and I'm drinking non-vintage champagne.\" Perhaps the \u00a310,000-a-week for failing to rescue Forest from relegation last season dented his legendary confidence. But it is more likely to be \"the old foot in a bucket of hot water syndrome,\" as he said during the last World Cup. With a life under the tanning warmth of TV studio lights, Ron could find the First Division's backwaters a bit of a shock to the system. However, big-hearted Ron has not ruled out mucking in: \"If someone did take over the job at Albion and wanted a bit of help I'd always be willing to give them that.\" Former Bolton boss Colin Todd, ex-Stoke supremo Gary Megson, Cheltenham coach Steve Cotterill and Kidderminster Harriers' Jan Molby are leading the race to join the Baggies. The latter is presumably in the running - if that's not too strong a word for it - because, like Ron, he puts the \"big\" back into football management. THE RUMOUR MILL Manchester United have joined Lazio, Internazionale and Parma in the chase for River Plate's attacking midfielder Pablo Aimar. Arsenal are prepared to pay Parma \u00a38m for French World Cup defender Lilian Thuram. Leicester want Coventry's Noel Whelan, and will also gamble \u00a35m on John Hartson, who failed a Spurs medical earlier this week. Either move could see Emile Heskey move to Liverpool. Spurs will listen to offers for Ruel Fox and Ramon Vega. Paul Williams is a summer target for Everton. The 28-year-old Coventry midfielder will be available on a free transfer. Bradford have rejected a bid from Huddersfield Town for out-of-favour striker Lee Mills. NEWS IN BRIEF Dundee will sign Sporting Gijon's veteran centre-half Jose Jesus Mesas Puerta and 24-year-old midfielder Javier Artero in the next 24 hours. Leicester City manager Martin O'Neill is to offer a new contract to emerging midfielder Stefan Oakes. Ade Akinbiyi has been charged with misconduct by the FA for his actions in Wolves' recent match against Nottingham Forest 11 days ago. Akinbiyi was sent off after headbutting Tony Vaughan and then refused to leave the pitch, lashing out at his own team-mates and appearing to catch his captain Keith Curle in the face. Hearts goalkeeper Gilles Rousset has agreed a new one-year contract with the Tynecastle club. Norwich have joined forces with Parma in a move that will see top young players from the Canaries' football academy training with the Uefa Cup holders, with Italian youth players making reciprocal visits to Norfolk.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Between spoonfuls of Fruit Corner, Billy, the youngest of my part-time children, produced a piping profundity. </p> <p>\"Er, Joe.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, er, Billy?\" </p> <p>\"Do you know what?\" </p> <p>\"What?\" </p> <p>\"You know Andy? </p> <p>\"Yeah.\" </p> <p>\"Andy hasn't got a dad.\" </p> <p>He was talking, of course, about the little boy in the Toy Story films, the owner of Woody and Buzz. And he was absolutely right: so far as anyone can tell, Andy only has a mum. She's an insubstantial character: in Toy Story 2 she has few lines of dialogue and only one significant scene, while in the original movie I can't recall even seeing her face. But at least it is clear she exists. By contrast, Andy's co-progenitor is a mystery, an enigma, literally an unseen man. </p> <p>Who is he? A hopeless workaholic who never gets home before dark? A shameless love rat, deservedly divorced? One of those rumoured internet sperm spivs who broody women pick from websites to provide vials of reproductive fluid for a fee? (OK, Andy was conceived before cyberspace got that weird but, hey, relish the thought). </p> <p>Whatever, Billy's insight immediately struck me as an opportunity to seize the moral high ground. It's a manoeuvre I have rehearsed many times. When I'm being a sad bastard I construct mental conversations with Billy and his big siblings in which I demonstrate that I'm the most devoted daddy in the world, that their lovestruck mother Dilys does not deserve to share them, and that their pseudo-stepdad Chris The Pillock is a posturing parvenu. Oh, the poignancy of their questions in these delicious reveries! Oh, the aching melodrama of my replies! </p> <p>\"But how could our mum leave us? And leave you, too, all on your own?\" </p> <p>\"Only she can tell you that, my angels. But suffering has made us strong.\" </p> <p>Beat that, Albert Square. </p> <p>Alas, reality is rarely quite so tidy. \"You're quite right, Billy,\" I began. \"Andy doesn't seem to have a dad. I wonder why that is?\" </p> <p>\"He dumped them, I expect,\" growled Gloria, tossing her magenta mane. \"Couldn't cope with commitment.\" </p> <p>Jed said nothing, as usual. But he whispered something to Billy, and Billy instantly announced: \"He's probably just dead!\" </p> <p>Shrugging off this glib dismissal of paternal bereavement, I soldiered on: \"Well, Gloria, maybe it was the mum who did the dumping. But I suppose the people who made Toy Story thought if Andy was only going to have one parent it would have to be his mum. After all, lone dads are exceptional. You don't get very many.\" </p> <p>I let that one sink in. Then . . . </p> <p>\"Yes you do,\" said Billy, firmly. </p> <p>\"Oh really. Like who?\" </p> <p>\"Like in Pocahontas. She's only got a dad.\" </p> <p>\"Alright, then,\" I countered, \"What about Dumbo? That's just him and Mrs Jumbo against a cruel, uncaring world. Not a dad in sight.\" </p> <p>But Billy was listening to Jed whispering again: \"And the Little Mermaid!\" Billy almost shouted. \"She's only got a dad, too!\" </p> <p>\"She doesn't count,\" I blustered. \"She's a vain, silly sea creature who wants to marry into a family of sea creature-eaters.

      "bodyText": "Between spoonfuls of Fruit Corner, Billy, the youngest of my part-time children, produced a piping profundity. \"Er, Joe.\" \"Yes, er, Billy?\" \"Do you know what?\" \"What?\" \"You know Andy? \"Yeah.\" \"Andy hasn't got a dad.\" He was talking, of course, about the little boy in the Toy Story films, the owner of Woody and Buzz. And he was absolutely right: so far as anyone can tell, Andy only has a mum. She's an insubstantial character: in Toy Story 2 she has few lines of dialogue and only one significant scene, while in the original movie I can't recall even seeing her face. But at least it is clear she exists. By contrast, Andy's co-progenitor is a mystery, an enigma, literally an unseen man. Who is he? A hopeless workaholic who never gets home before dark? A shameless love rat, deservedly divorced? One of those rumoured internet sperm spivs who broody women pick from websites to provide vials of reproductive fluid for a fee? (OK, Andy was conceived before cyberspace got that weird but, hey, relish the thought). Whatever, Billy's insight immediately struck me as an opportunity to seize the moral high ground. It's a manoeuvre I have rehearsed many times. When I'm being a sad bastard I construct mental conversations with Billy and his big siblings in which I demonstrate that I'm the most devoted daddy in the world, that their lovestruck mother Dilys does not deserve to share them, and that their pseudo-stepdad Chris The Pillock is a posturing parvenu. Oh, the poignancy of their questions in these delicious reveries! Oh, the aching melodrama of my replies! \"But how could our mum leave us? And leave you, too, all on your own?\" \"Only she can tell you that, my angels. But suffering has made us strong.\" Beat that, Albert Square. Alas, reality is rarely quite so tidy. \"You're quite right, Billy,\" I began. \"Andy doesn't seem to have a dad. I wonder why that is?\" \"He dumped them, I expect,\" growled Gloria, tossing her magenta mane. \"Couldn't cope with commitment.\" Jed said nothing, as usual. But he whispered something to Billy, and Billy instantly announced: \"He's probably just dead!\" Shrugging off this glib dismissal of paternal bereavement, I soldiered on: \"Well, Gloria, maybe it was the mum who did the dumping. But I suppose the people who made Toy Story thought if Andy was only going to have one parent it would have to be his mum. After all, lone dads are exceptional. You don't get very many.\" I let that one sink in. Then . . . \"Yes you do,\" said Billy, firmly. \"Oh really. Like who?\" \"Like in Pocahontas. She's only got a dad.\" \"Alright, then,\" I countered, \"What about Dumbo? That's just him and Mrs Jumbo against a cruel, uncaring world. Not a dad in sight.\" But Billy was listening to Jed whispering again: \"And the Little Mermaid!\" Billy almost shouted. \"She's only got a dad, too!\" \"She doesn't count,\" I blustered. \"She's a vain, silly sea creature who wants to marry into a family of sea creature-eaters. She's a bimbo and a collaborator. Isn't she Gloria?\" But this appeal to my big daughter's suffragette streak was doomed: \"There's only a dad in Beauty and the Beast,\" she said. \"Thing is, he's a bit mad!\" Amid peals of laughter, my strategy capsized. \"There's only a dad in The Swan Princess,\" Billy squeaked, now drunk on triumph. \"And in A Goofy Movie,\" drawled Gloria from across the table, delivering the coup de grace.

As the child gets older, our chit-chat matures, too - but are we saying what our children need to hear? </p> <p>According to speech therapist Dr Sally Ward, whose book Babytalk is published this week, a more structured approach to talking to children - a \"programme\", no less - can have a dramatic effect not only on the child's language development but also on his or her IQ. Ward argues that because children acquire all language skills in their first four years, the right stimulus at this critical stage can speed up a child's linguistic development - and with it, their cognitive skills. </p> <p>At the heart of the programme, which is based on 20 years of research into the acquisition of language, is what appears to be a simple requirement: that parents spend half an hour a day in a quiet environment (no music, no hoovering, and definitely no television) playing with their child. </p> <p>Surely, even with the pressures of work, this is something most parents do anyway? \"In my experience it isn't, for all sorts of reasons,\" says Ward. \"At one end of the scale you have youngsters stuck in front of the TV. At the other, you have toddlers being whisked around by nannies to Tumble Tots, baby gyms and music classes. Parents and carers often forget the importance of one-to-one contact. </p> <p>\"Parents do not need to feel guilty about going out to work, and they don't need to spend huge amounts of time with their children at this stage. If you're following the programme, 30 minutes a day is fine.\" </p> <p>The book is divided into age bands from birth to four. Ward offers a detailed account of expected communication, speech and language development for each age group, and advice on making the most out of playtime. </p> <p>In her clinical and research work Ward has observed that it is often well-meaning parents who cause problems, often because of their own unrealistic expectations. \"Parents are tremendously keen to do the right thing, but they sometimes don't know what they should be doing.\" </p> <p>The most common mistakes are speaking too fast, using complicated sentences, and an overenthusiastic attitude towards correcting their childrens' speech. Perfectionist grandparents, overworked childminders and nannies with a poor command of English are also fingered. Ward cites the case of a little boy who was looked after by 16 different foreign nannies in his first two years. His speech suffered, but he made a rapid recovery under the Babytalk programme. </p> <p>Despite the promise of \"stress-free fun for parent and child\", there is a long list of don'ts, the most important of which is that parents should not ask their baby to say or copy words or sounds. \"There is no need,\" Ward explains. \"Our job is to talk to him in the most appropriate way. If we do this, he will look after the talking.\" </p> <p>She is also particularly firm about not correcting speech, as this will send the wrong signals, making them self-conscious and less likely to try out new words. She also urges parents to resist the temptation to tick children off with negative speech such as \"Don't do that\", \"Get down now!\", \"Stop it at once\" in favour of physical restraint. </p> <p>There are strict rules across all age groups: no television at all for very young babies; no more than half an hour a day for older children. She is quite firm about allowing toddlers to use baby words such as \"tummy\" and \"gee-gee\" rather the adult forms, which she says they will soon pick up. </p> <p>Parents hoping this book will help their child clear the first hurdle in New Labour's regime of virtually continual testing throughout their school career will be disappointed. \"This is an 'enabling' rather than a teaching or a testing tool,\" Ward insists. \"The idea is to help parents give their children the best possible foundation for their future learning.\" </p> <p><strong> The babytalk programme</strong><br> </p> <p> * Birth to three months: spend half an hour a day, from day one, talking to her. Use short, simple sentences that are tuneful, such as \"Up you come\" or \"You're on my knee\". Speak slowly, with pauses between each phrase. Use lots of repetition. </p> <p>*Six to nine months: she will continue to enjoy repetitive, simple interactive language games. Play \"Clap hands\" and \"Peekaboo\" using the same words and actions each time, always with a lively facial expression. Repeat her sounds back to her, and say for her what she means, but never ask her to copy sounds or words. Make play sounds to go with what is happening, such as \"brm brm\"as you push a toy car. </p> <p>*Twelve to 16 months: help her to enjoy listening, through \"noise\" books and noisy toys. Use short, simple (but grammatical) sentences. Speak slower and louder than normal, with a singsong voice. Point to objects when you name them. Your baby will be more mobile, but keep language positive. Distract him physically rather than saying \"No\" or \"Don't touch\". </p> <p>*Sixteen months to two years: bring in new words, but keep to a \"running commentary\" on what she's doing.

My 10-year-old daughter Phoebe opened up the letter from the St Marylebone school, and there it was: the announcement that she was one of the lucky 120 applicants (out of a total of 723) to be offered a place there this autumn. But there was no celebrating; instead, all hell broke loose. </p> <p>St Marylebone is a multi-faith, single-sex state school. It is top of the Westminster league tables and the most improved state school in the country at GCSE level. Little wonder that most parents - me included - are desperate to send their children there. But not my husband, Dan. He felt passionately that she should go to Queens Park community school, where Phoebe had also been offered a place. QPCS is a mixed comprehensive somewhere near the bottom of the Brent league tables, but rising fast. It has suffered over the years from too many middle-class parents (like us) moving their children out of the area to other more popular state schools. Now at last, after a massive rebuilding programme and a slow but steady improvement in results, the school is gaining popularity. </p> <p>For a week Dan and I waged a fierce but civilised war, made all the more complicated by the fact that each of us saw merits in the other school. My argument was that Phoebe, an industrious, intelligent girl, needed the stimulation of a more academic school and would benefit from being in an all-girl environment. His argument was that she would do equally well at QPCS, while benefiting from a more dynamic and exciting environment. He also felt single-sex schooling was a disadvantage socially if not academically and he couldn't understand why I wanted to subject a child to two journeys a day in a crowded tube when the alternative was a short walk across a park. </p> <p>When the deputy chief whip, Keith Bradley, announced at the weekend that he was taking his son out of the local comprehensive and sending him to the fee-paying Manchester grammar, he was condemned from all sides. But at least there seems to have been a semblance of family unity within the Bradley household. Not so for us. </p> <p>For the first time in our long and harmonious marriage we found ourselves at a deadlock. We tried desperately to remain reasonable but for a week the subject was discussed, mauled, massacred and cried over until we both realised we would never agree. At this point we had no choice but to put the ball firmly back into Phoebe's hands, giving her a week to make up her mind, and making a pact with each other not to influence her. </p> <p>While Phoebe had been thrilled to be accepted by Marylebone and was initially convinced that it was the school for her, it then transpired that her two best friends were going to QPCS. Suddenly the local school seemed overwhelmingly attractive. Furthermore, reading the long list of rules from St Marylebone made the trek by tube to Baker Street seem even more daunting. </p> <p>As a parent it's a weird sensation to find yourself suddenly bereft of advice for your child when there's so much you want to say but, out of loyalty and fairness to your partner, so little you feel you can. I spoke to a fellow parent who told me categorically, \"You simply can't leave such an important decision up to Phoebe. You two have to come to some kind of agreement and help her out.\" But the trouble was we couldn't reach an agreement as neither of us were prepared to back down from something that went to the core of our beliefs. </p> <p>No doubt our own schooling came into play here. I went to a small independent girls' school in London (\"rarefied and insular\", Dan calls it); Dan want to a large boys' comprehensive in King's Cross (\"rough and tough\", I call it. Although Marylebone is neither rarefied nor insular and QPCS has left its rough, tough reputation behind it, nevertheless our very different educational backgrounds inform our views. </p> <p>When I was telling all this to a close friend, her French husband left the room. \"All you English people ever do is talk about schools,\" he said. But the English education system is so fragmented, so selective and so open to abuse that there are no simple choices to be made.

But he has a passion for change and a strong presence in our community; for him, not sending his daughter to the local school felt like a betrayal of that community. </p> <p>In the end, however, we both had to accept that this wasn't about our needs.

      "body": "<p>Vicky Diaz is a 34-year-old mother of five. A former teacher in the Philippines, she migrated to the United States to work as a housekeeper and nanny to the two-year-old son of a wealthy family in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. </p> <p>\"Even now, my children are trying to convince me to go home,\" she says. \"They weren't angry when I left because they were still very young. My husband couldn't get angry either because he knew this was the only way I could help him raise our children. I send them money every month.\" </p> <p>The Beverly Hills family pays Vicky $400 a week; Vicky pays her own family's live-in domestic worker back in the Philippines $40 a week. But living in this \"global care chain\" is not easy on Vicky and her family. \"I'm paid well, but I'm sinking in work. Even while I am ironing the clothes, they can still call you to the kitchen to wash the plates. It is also very depressing. Away from my children, the only thing I can do is give all my love to Tommy [the two-year-old American child].\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, Vicky got her job by telling her prospective employer she had experience raising children. \"They asked me if I knew how to take care of a child and I told them I did because I had five of my own.\" </p> <p>Global capitalism affects whatever it touches, and it touches everything. Global care chains are usually made up of women. Most start in a poor country and end in a rich one. The chain Vicky Diaz finds herself in is an increasingly common one: (1) an older daughter from a poor family cares for her siblings while (2) her mother works as a nanny caring for the children of a migrating nanny who (3) cares for the child of a family in a rich country. </p> <p>However long the care chain is, everyone in it tends to focus on the link closest to them. From time to time, Vicky may feel keenly the link between her love for the children she is paid to care for and love of her own children, whom she pays another to nurture. But her American employers are more likely to see this love as natural, individual, uncircumscribed by context. \"Vicky is a loving person,\" they might say. \"Vicky loves Tommy.\" </p> <p>But can love be \"displaced\" from Vicky Diaz's son Alfredo, in the Philippines, on to Tommy, the son of her employers in Los Angeles? And should we worry that the direction of displacement is upwards in privilege and power? Are first-world countries importing maternal love as they have imported copper, zinc and gold from third-world countries in the past? Love is not simply a \"resource\" that can be taken from one person and given to another, but nor is it entirely unlike a resource. Is time spent with the first-world child \"taken from\" a child further down the care chain? Is the Beverly Hills toddler getting \"surplus\" love just as the mine owner gets surplus value from the worker digging for gold? </p> <p>The idea is unwelcome, both to Vicky Diaz, who wants a first-world job, and to her well-meaning employers who need someone to give loving care to their child. Each person along the chain feels he or she is doing the right thing for good reasons. But transfer of care takes its toll both on the child left behind and on the mother. \"When I saw my children,\" said one Filipino nanny, weeping, \"I thought, 'Oh, children do grow up even without their mother.' I left my youngest when she was only five. She was nine when I saw her again but she still wanted me to carry her. That hurt me because it showed me that my children missed out a lot.\" </p> <p>Sometimes the toll it takes is overwhelming. As one Filipino nanny said: \"The first two years I felt I was going crazy. I would catch myself thinking about my baby. Every moment, every second of the day. When I receive a letter from my children, I cannot sleep. I cry.\" </p> <p>Given the depth of this unhappiness, one might imagine care chains are a minimal part of the global show. But this is not the case. Since the early 50s, for example, 55% of migrants from the Philippines have been women and, next to electronic manufacturing, their remittances make up the country's major source of foreign currency. Recent improvements in the economy have not reduced female emigration; rather, it continues to increase. In addition, migrants are not drawn from the poorest classes. In one study of migrant Filipino domestic workers, over half the nannies were graduates and most were married mothers in their 30s. </p> <p>Money provides a powerful incentive to work and the yawning global wage gap provides a powerful incentive to move. Migration is, simply, a ticket to a better life. </p> <p>Just as global capitalism helps create a third-world supply of mothering, so it creates a first-world demand for it. At the first-world end, there has been a huge rise in the number of women in paid work -from 15% of mothers of children aged six and under in 1950 to 65% today. Indeed, American women now make up 45% of the US labour force; 75% of mothers of children aged 18 and under now work, as do 65% of mothers of children aged six and under. </p> <p>In addition, working hours have been rising and a lot of American grandmothers, who might otherwise have looked after a worker's children, now do paid work themselves. Thus, at the first-world end of care chains, we find working parents who are grateful to find a good nanny and able to pay more than the nanny could earn in her native country. </p> <p>First-world women who hire nannies are themselves caught in a male career pattern that has proved surprisingly resistant to change. Women have joined the law, academia, medicine, business - professions still organised for men with families who are free of family responsibilities. Today, men take on much more of the childcare and housework, but they still base their identity on demanding careers. Hence the resistance to sharing care at home and the search for care further \"down\" the global chain. </p> <p>Among these first-world mothers are those who give their emotional labour, in turn, to companies that hold themselves out as a \"family\". Researching a leading multinational company I call Amerco, I discovered a disproportionate number of women employed in the human side: public relations, marketing, human resources. It was often the \"soft touch\" of women that made Amerco seem like a family to other workers. Among the ultimate beneficiaries of various care chains we thus find multinational companies. </p> <p>Given the existence of this global care chain, and given the chain's growing scope, it is worth asking how we are to respond. I can think of three ways to see care chains: through the eyes of the primordialist, the sunshine modernist, and the critical modernist. To the primordialist, the right thing would be for each of us to take care of only our own family, in our own nation. To such a person, the existence of care chains seems wrong. Because such care is usually done by women, primordialists often also believe that women should stay at home to provide this care. </p> <p>But for the sunshine modernist, care chains are an inevitable part of globalisation, which is itself uncritically accepted as good. If a supply of labour meets demand, the sunshine modernist is satisfied - the issue of inequality of access to care disappears. </p> <p>The critical modernist has a global sense of ethics. If she goes out to buy Nike shoes, she is concerned to learn how low the wage and how long the hours were for the third-world factory worker making them. She applies the same moral concern to care. So she cares about the welfare of the Filipino child back home, and sees globalisation as a very mixed blessing. It brings new opportunities - and the nanny's access to good wages is one - but also new problems, including costs we have hardly begun to understand. Though it is not always the case, the poor maid's child may be getting less motherly care than the first-world child. We needn't lapse into primordialism to sense that something may be amiss and to search for solutions. </p> <p> One approach is to try to reduce incentives to migrate by addressing the causes of the migrant's economic desperation. Another would be to raise the value of caring work, such that whoever did it got more credit as well as money for it, and care wasn't such a \"pass on\" job. The value of the labour of raising a child - always low relative to the value of other kinds of labour - has, under the impact of globalisation, sunk lower still. The declining value of childcare can be compared with the declining value of basic food crops relative to manufactured goods on the international market. Though clearly more necessary to life, crops such as wheat, rice or cocoa fetch low and declining prices, while those of manufactured goods continue to soar. </p> <p>Just as the market price of primary produce keeps the third world low in the community of nations, so the low market value of care keeps the status of the women who do it - and, by association, all women - low. A final basic solution would be to involve fathers in caring for their children. If fathers shared care, it would spread laterally instead of being passed down a social class ladder. </p> <p>According to the International Labour Organisation, half of the world's women between 15 and 64 are in paid work. Since 1950, the rate of increase has skyrocketed in the US and has been high in Scandinavia and the UK. If we want developed societies, with women doctors, political leaders, teachers and computer programmers, we will need qualified people to help care for their children. And there is no reason why every society should not enjoy such loving paid childcare. </p> <p>It may even be true that Vicky Diaz is the person to provide it. At the same time, critical modernists would be wise to extend their concern to the possible hidden losers in the care chain. For these days, the personal is global. </p> <p>This is an extract from an essay which appears in On the Edge: Living with Global Capitalism, edited by Will Hutton and Anthony Giddens, published by Jonathan Cape on March 9, price\u00a316.99.

And if business does not seize its chance, it risks being left behind in the race for low carbon technologies.\" </p> <p>The UK is one of the leading advocates of action to reduce greenhouse gases and head off the worst consequences of climate change. This week, John Prescott will publish the government's long awaited strategy to cut UK emissions. It will emphasise the economic opportunities of moving to a low carbon economy, but it requires government action to persuade most businesses to take the opportunities seriously. </p> <p>In two weeks' time, the chancellor, Gordon Brown will make the final touches to the climate change levy, which created fury in business circles last year. But he rode the storm, made some sensible changes, and business is now rapidly coming up with its own initiatives on climate change. </p> <p>One group of trade associations - including the chemicals, cement and metals industries - has started to negotiate legally binding agreements to achieve improvements in their energy efficiency. In return, the government will give them an 80% reduction in climate change levy. This is welcome, but is only the first step towards recognising the challenge of climate change. The agreements are proving slow, bureaucratic and secretive - and they will not guarantee absolute reductions in emissions if output increases. </p> <p>Another group of companies, including BP Amoco, Blue Circle and British Steel, is offering something far more significant: to collectively sign up to an absolute cap on their carbon emissions between now and 2010. Once that cap has been set, each company would be allocated permits to emit a proportion of the total emissions and a market could be set up in those permits. The total number of permits available, and therefore emissions, would be controlled by government, but the companies would then be allowed to buy, sell or bank the permits throughout the period. This idea has been successful in the US for controlling sulphur emissions, but no country has introduced a carbon emissions trading scheme. </p> <p>So, for example, company A is allocated permits to emit 30 tonnes of carbon in 2001 and company B is allocated 50 tonnes. Company A wants to expand, but, even with the most efficient technology, it will still need to emit 33 tonnes in 2002. At the same time, company B has made a cost effective efficiency investment which reduces its emissions to 45 tonnes. With permit trading, company B could sell permits for 3 tonnes to company A, allowing both companies to meet their obligations while actually reducing overall emissions from 80 tonnes to 78. </p> <p> S o all initiatives to cut emissions would be rewarded by the ability to sell unwanted permits, but if a company wanted to produce more emissions then it could buy extra permits to cover them. </p> <p>Emissions trading is potentially a very powerful policy instrument, and both business and government are committed to the principle. If major companies are willing to pledge absolute cuts in their carbon emissions, then the debate over climate change would take a major step forward. </p> <p>However, to make it happen two decisions have to be made. First, what carbon emissions reductions should the system deliver? Second, what incentives should government offer companies who sign up? </p> <p>Emissions trading is only a desirable environmental policy if the carbon cap is ambitious and will deliver greater reductions than would have otherwise occurred. </p> <p>Based on the analysis of cost effective options from the energy technology support unit (Etsu) and the experience of other trading schemes, a reduction of CO <sub>2 </sub>emissions of 20% by 2010 would be reasonable. It is also a target of political significance, being the government's own manifesto pledge for CO <sub>2 </sub>emissions. </p> <p>Signing up to such a reduction would be a risk for many companies and government should recognise that by creating incentives for those who take part in emissions trading. The chancellor has an ideal opportunity in the forthcoming budget.

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, has described it as a \"scar on the soul of Britain\". And no wonder there is grave concern over the increase in child poverty when currently one in three lives in a poor household. </p> <p>To date, policymakers have been forced to wage war against child poverty using information about who is poor at a point in time. The children who are currently poor may include someone whose dad is newly unemployed who has fallen on hard times for a few months but will shortly bounce back with a well-paid job, to a child in a lone-parent family who has been poor since birth. </p> <p>Policy design needs to recognise the persistence of poverty. The longer a child is poor, the greater the deprivation entailed. Moreover, poverty during childhood has long-term effects, reducing the chances of being successful in adult life. </p> <p>New research from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex reveals the extent to which children and adults were in poverty year-in year-out or poor for relatively brief periods from 1991-1996. The research, co-sponsored by Unicef, and based on the British Household Panel Survey, sheds light on low-income persistence and highlights the poverty risks faced by children relative to adults. The analysis shows that young children have a disproportionately high risk of experiencing repeated poverty. </p> <p> D uring 1991-1996, more than one in five pre-school children lived in households where the income was below the poverty line for at least half of this period, compared to just one in 10 people in the population as a whole. The poverty line used was half the middle (median) income in 1991, which in today's prices would be \u00a3180 per week for a couple with two kids, ie close to the amount they would get from income support. That's a paltry \u00a326 per day. </p> <p>As well as counting how often people are poor, it is possible to measure poverty persistence by looking at incomes directly. </p> <p>People's incomes fluctuate a lot from one year to the next, so many of those who were classified as poor last year will not be poor this year. So some of this year's poverty is transitory. If people could transfer their income from good times to bad times, then many might no longer feature in the statistics. </p> <p>Using this measure, young children again come out worst off relative to other groups. Almost three-quarters (71%) of the total poverty experienced by pre- schoolers was chronic, compared to three-fifths (60%) for all children and just over one half (56%) for the population as a whole.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, has described it as a \"scar on the soul of Britain\". And no wonder there is grave concern over the increase in child poverty when currently one in three lives in a poor household. To date, policymakers have been forced to wage war against child poverty using information about who is poor at a point in time. The children who are currently poor may include someone whose dad is newly unemployed who has fallen on hard times for a few months but will shortly bounce back with a well-paid job, to a child in a lone-parent family who has been poor since birth. Policy design needs to recognise the persistence of poverty. The longer a child is poor, the greater the deprivation entailed. Moreover, poverty during childhood has long-term effects, reducing the chances of being successful in adult life. New research from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex reveals the extent to which children and adults were in poverty year-in year-out or poor for relatively brief periods from 1991-1996. The research, co-sponsored by Unicef, and based on the British Household Panel Survey, sheds light on low-income persistence and highlights the poverty risks faced by children relative to adults. The analysis shows that young children have a disproportionately high risk of experiencing repeated poverty. D uring 1991-1996, more than one in five pre-school children lived in households where the income was below the poverty line for at least half of this period, compared to just one in 10 people in the population as a whole. The poverty line used was half the middle (median) income in 1991, which in today's prices would be \u00a3180 per week for a couple with two kids, ie close to the amount they would get from income support. That's a paltry \u00a326 per day. As well as counting how often people are poor, it is possible to measure poverty persistence by looking at incomes directly. People's incomes fluctuate a lot from one year to the next, so many of those who were classified as poor last year will not be poor this year. So some of this year's poverty is transitory. If people could transfer their income from good times to bad times, then many might no longer feature in the statistics. Using this measure, young children again come out worst off relative to other groups. Almost three-quarters (71%) of the total poverty experienced by pre- schoolers was chronic, compared to three-fifths (60%) for all children and just over one half (56%) for the population as a whole. Even if you make the poverty cut- off somewhat higher, or somewhat lower, these patterns don't change. Children, particularly young children, are still at greater risk of experiencing persistent and chronic poverty. In order to deliver on the prime minister's promise to eradicate child poverty within 20 years, the government has introduced, or is planning to implement, a range of measures aimed at helping their parents into work and to make work pay more for those who already have jobs. These measures include the working family tax credit, the children's tax credit (from next year), the Sure Start programme and the New Deals for lone parents and the partners of unemployed people. What is notable about all of these is that they are focused on helping people make the transition from benefits to work rather than just alleviating poverty by increasing out-of-work benefits (though of course the government is also increasing payments under income support for children and increasing child benefit). This dual approach, including a focus on dynamics, is to be lauded. The government has also recently undertaken to monitor annually poverty persistence as well as current poverty as part of its \"opportunity for all\" initiative, which is another welcome move. \u0095 Stephen Jenkins is a professor at the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex.

On the other, the three southern African nations, together with South Africa, want Cites to approve further ivory sales this year, pledging that profits will be put back into conservation.

      "bodyText": "Nehemiah Rotich, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, is battling against a bloody upsurge of elephant poaching, so he doesn't mince his words. \"We are very unhappy with the UK position on ivory trade,\" he says. \"It is a major point of concern for us.\" Rotich and his boss, the anthropologist Richard Leakey, who heads Kenya's Office of the President, believe the UK may support four southern African nations in their bid to step up international ivory trade when the UN endangered species convention (Cites) meets in Nairobi next month. \"Britain has such a key presence in Kenya as a development partner that I would have expected them to better understand what opening up ivory trade would mean for us,\" said Rotich during a last-ditch lobbying tour of Washington DC and London. \"The tourist industry which funds the wildlife service would be badly hit and we would risk a return to the poaching holocaust of the 1980s.\" Rotich's tough talking is the latest salvo in a bitter war of words over how best to preserve the African elephant. On the one hand, Kenya and its east and central African allies argue that the 1990 ban on international ivory trade - partially lifted last year to allow a \"one-off\" sale of stockpiled tusks from Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to Japan - must be reinstated. On the other, the three southern African nations, together with South Africa, want Cites to approve further ivory sales this year, pledging that profits will be put back into conservation. And with Africa divided, the votes of the EU and the US may well decide the outcome. The omens are not good for Kenya. According to Rotich, Europe's governments, and particularly the UK, are snubbing Kenya's proposal to reinstate the elephant populations of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana to Appendix 1 of Cites, which forbids international trade in listed species. \"Officially, the British government has not yet decided how to vote,\" Rotich says, \"but they openly oppose Kenya's proposal - which implies that they support the southern African position.\" Rotich is armed with a welter of statistics to support his case that further breaches of the ivory ban would risk a return to the 1980s' killing fields, when poachers slaughtered 600,000 African elephants.

      "bodyText": "Serious fighting erupted in the disputed, northern suburbs of Mitrovice yesterday after hand grenades were thrown into crowds of Serbs and French troops of the K-For peacekeeping contingent in Kosovo's flashpoint town. Around 40 soldiers and civilians, including a young child, were injured. Automatic gunfire was later heard in another part of the north side, near where the Nato-led administration had been trying to return ethnic Albanians who fled from their tower-block apartments after 10 people were killed by Serb gangs. The violence was the latest evidence of deteriorating security in the province of Kosovo. Nearby, in the southern Presevo region of Serbia proper, an increasing number of ethnic Albanians have been running away into Kosovo. They are fearful that clashes will intensify in Presevo between new Albanian paramilitary units and Serb police. On Monday, 626 Albanians registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the Kosovo town of Gnjilane. But it has been in Mitrovice, a town with a big Albanian majority where Serbs dominate the north bank of the river Ibar and Albanians the south, that Nato is facing its stiffest test in trying to reintegrate bitterly divided peoples. Yesterday's disturbances began, according to Lieutenant Matthieu Mabin, a spokesman for the French force in charge of the area, as a fight between two men in the Bosnjacka Mahala section of the town where Serbs were registering to return to their homes in the southern suburbs. The brawling spread, then shots were heard. \"That created panic and hand grenades were thrown, we don't know from whom or from where ... but it created very many injured, especially French soldiers,\" said Lieut Mabin. According to Oliver Ivanovic, a local Serb official, the violence began after an ethnic Albanian attacked a Serb with a metal bar. When the Serb retaliated, another Albanian appeared and shot at the Serb before hand grenades were tossed into the Serb crowd. Philippe Paco, a spokesman for the UN mission which is trying to administer Kosovo, said: \"One Albanian fired a hunting rifle [at] a young man and wounded him and immediately after that Albanians from a courtyard fired two hand grenades\". By late afternoon local hospitals had treated 20 Serbs, 14 French K-For soldiers and five Albanians. Two of the Serbs were reported to have been seriously wounded. A Reuters reporter at the scene said he saw six French soldiers and an officer injured when Albanians threw explosive devices at a military unit surrounding an Albanian house from which there had been shooting. Colonel Patrick Chanliau, another K-For spokesman, said French soldiers were still surrounding the house where the shooting had started. He also confirmed that a child was among the injured. Several cars were later set alight. Extra troops and UN police were posted at the bridges dividing the town. The atmosphere remained very tense but quieter after the shooting ended. Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, called for more peacekeepers in Kosovo, after he held a meeting with the UN special envoy to the Balkans, Carl Bildt. Earlier, Russian politicians had suggested Russia might pull out of the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo in protest at inadequate protection for the province's minority Serbs.",

      "body": "<p>After the first election year contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, the Republicans took the scenic route to Super Tuesday that led through South Carolina, Michigan and Virginia. The Democrats went more directly to it, amid far less squabbling and without nearly so much entertainment. Last night, though, both American parties rejoined one another to find their presidential nominations at the same place and back in step.</p> <p>Super Tuesday 2000 accomplished exactly what the fixers designed it to do, by enabling the two party establishment favourites to rack up emphatic wins in yesterday's contests which effectively end their respective challengers' hopes. The contest in November will be Al Gore v George W Bush, just as the party bosses planned. Bill Bradley won't you please go home now. And bye bye Johnnie McCain.</p> <p>On the Democratic side, last night's results were a triple triumph for Al Gore. Not only did the vice-president knock down Bill Bradley's challenge everywhere that it raised its head, giving Gore eleven wins out of eleven yesterday. He also won each contest by a distance. And, in addition, Gore had the satisfaction of accomplishing a shut-out mission that he himself helped to plan.</p> <p>The vice-president's wins were big. Gore won in California, where Bradley was supposed to have so much Silicon Valley support; he won in New York, where Bradley was meant to be rewarded for those idolised years on the Knicks' basketball court; he won in Missouri, where Bradley was born and raised; he won in New England, where Democrats are supposed to lean to the kind of gentle left alternative which Bradley was offering. In most places, Gore didn't just defeat Bradley, he overwhelmed him. The margin was over 65 points in Georgia, a state with a moderate Democratic governor, a result which, in itself, is surely enough for Bradley to see the futility of continuing into next week, when there are six more southern primaries.</p> <p>Assuming that Bradley now withdraws, as surely he will, the redesign of Super Tuesday 2000 has worked exactly the way that the Gore people anticipated. They themselves moved the California primary up the calendar from June to March precisely in order to make the largest state - which Gore has worked for years - count for more in the scheme of things. That made March 7 into a hurdle which only a well-funded, well-grounded candidate could clear. Yesterday was in every sense a victory for the Democratic machine that Al Gore controls.</p> <p>But a mirror image triumph was played out yesterday on the Republican side too. March 7 was also tailor made for the frontrunner George W Bush, with his money, his endorsements, his organisation and his conservatism. Here too, the proliferation of contests enabled the front-runner to defeat an overextended rival. If California had not voted yesterday, McCain's clutch of little wins in New England states would look much more impressive than they do this morning, when they are eclipsed by his losses in California and elsewhere.</p> <p>In terms of individual states won and lost in this campaign, McCain and Bush still remain more or less on competitive terms this morning. But today the weight and the momentum is all irresistibly with Bush. California, Ohio and a majority among voters in the byzantine politics of New York give the Texas governor the wins that mattered most.</p> <p>A bad outlook for McCain only gets worse when you consider that the nine next Republican primaries - three in the western mountain states this weekend, and six in the south next week - all look to have Bush's name on them. This time next week, as McCain knows only too well, things will look even more formidably difficult than they already do today. It's no wonder that the McCain camp is massively divided this morning about almost every decision that it must now take. To carry on or to quit. To bolt to the Reform Party or not. To go back to the drawing board for 2004 or not.</p> <p>Yet, listening to Bush and McCain address their supporters last night there was little doubt that they both recognised this was the decisive moment of the 2000 nominating campaign. Bush, like Gore, addressed himself to the November election not next week's primaries. McCain seemed to be signalling that, after a day or two of reflection, he will pull out. The mathematics of the delegate count for the national convention is simply against him.</p> <p>And so it will be, as some intended and many feared, an establishment v establishment general election, though with two candidates who are far from interchangeable. The big question today, as the rebels prepare to retreat from the field, is what happens to their voters? It is not clear that either Bush or Gore holds any instant appeal for what, a couple of weeks ago, called itself \"the McCain majority\" Inevitably now, the Reform Party - under Pat Buchanan or even Ross Perot once again - looms as a bigger player in the new game. The bigger likelihood is that the political rebels will simply decide to sit this one out, reducing the turnout in November still further in a country where fewer than half of the electorate now vote in presidential elections.</p>",

Bush was driven further to the right by the McCain challenge than Gore was forced to the left by Bradley. David Broder The Washington Post The single most important question in the election might be this: Where do the independent-minded people such as those who turned out for McCain in New Hampshire and Michigan end up going? Susan Page USA Today What McCain leaves behind, then, is a fractured party, a damaged Republican nominee apparent, and a large, unserved constituency at the heart of the American electorate. His campaign revealed a huge national appetite for political reform and personal integrity. Once McCain is gone, Bush and Gore will vie for the truth-starved, disenchanted voters he left behind. The one who wins them will be the next president. Jacob Weisberg Slate magazine McCain's up from nowhere campaign - driven by his compelling tale of Vietnam prisoner of war heroism and his straight talk style - was the compelling story of the 2000 race, rocking the Republican establishment. The New York Post It was a bravura performance by the vice president, if no longer surprising in view of the near-collapse of Mr. Bradley's campaign in recent weeks, and it positioned him well for the battle against the eventual Republican nominee, although perhaps situated somewhat farther to the left on some key issues than he had hoped.

      "body": "<b>Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman</b> <br> We have a system - and we can argue about how we got here - in which some cases have to go for jury trial. Those are the big cases. Some cases - the smaller ones - have to go before the magistrates. In between are many offences that are either way offences. There are 370 categories of such offences in English law, applicable in England and Wales. The proposal is that - without considering the detail or whether it is appropriate for the individual offence - all those offences will be changed in one go from a situation in which the defendant chooses the venue to the court choosing the venue. <p>The public case for retaining a broad base for jury trial is that it allows citizens to participate in the legal process. Jury trial is popular and adds to the legal system's credibility. It reduces those elements of the legal process in which only lawyers are involved.</p> <p><b>Robert Marshall-Andrews, Labour MP and barrister</b><br> The point of principle is that jury trial is fundamental to our system of criminal justice. The reason - which the government seek to avoid - is simply this: our system is adversarial. We do not inquire after the truth; we are interested in proof. The state brings the case against its own citizen, and must prove it. It is an axiom of our law that the state does not prove it in front of its own appointees. If cases are serious, they must be proved in front of your fellow citizens. That is the right that you have. That is not an aspersion on magistrates. It is simply a matter of saying that justice must be seen to be done.</p> <p><b>Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP and lawyer</b><br> Before trial by jury, England had trial by ordeal, which was certainly summary justice, the scope of which the home secretary is intent on extending. The ordeal often involved submerging people in cold water. If the suspect sank, God had accepted him, and he was innocent. If he bobbed to the surface, however, God had rejected him, and he was guilty. Today, we would call that a catch-22. I suspect that the home secretary, as a born-again Christian, and though constrained by the mores of modern civilisation, has a sneaking admiration for that quick, cost-free kind of summary justice.</p> <p><b>Jack Straw</b><br> The bill\u0085 enjoys the active endorsement of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, and of the vast majority of the High Court Bench of nearly 100 senior judges; of the Magistrates Association, representing 30,000 justices of the peace; and of all three police associations, representing more than 125,000 police officers, each of whom has to deal every day with the victims of crime and its perpetrators and who know that justice is not served, either for victim or defendant, by an antiquated and time-wasting procedure, which the bill seeks to remedy. </p> <p>In no sense does the bill undermine the availability of trial by jury for appropriate offences. What it does is to ensure that there is a fairer and more objective basis than the decision of the accused for determining which cases involving the middle range of offences should be so tried.</p> <p><b>Edward Garnier, Conservative party legal spokesman</b><br> He [Jack Straw] is not the only man guilty of conspiring to damage the administration of justice. Step forward another lawyer, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield [Mr Blair], who said that it was \"totally unsatisfactory\" to prevent defendants from choosing trial by jury. He said that \"fundamental rights to justice\" could not be \"driven by administrative convenience.\" I agree. </p> <p>Who else agrees with the views then expressed by those three members of the Government? The Criminal Bar Association, the Bar Council, the Association of Magisterial Officers, the Society of Labour Lawyers--every member of the home office apart from the minister of state, the hon. member for Norwich, South [Charles Clarke], may be a member of that august body - the Society of Conservative Lawyers, the Society of Liberal Democrat Lawyers, the Law Society, any number of Crown court and High Court judges to whom I and others have spoken but who cannot speak out publicly, the Legal Action Group, Justice, Liberty, the Institute of Race Relations, the Blackstone Society, the Howard League, the Portia Trust, Professor Lee Bridges - professor of law at Warwick university - Northumbria police, the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, the Quakers and the legal committee of the joint council of Her Majesty's stipendiary magistrates, the Institute of Legal Executives, the Society of Asian Lawyers, the Association of Chief Officers of Probation\u0085.</p> <p><b>Hazel Blears, Labour MP</b><br> Research has also shown that 27% of defendants who plead not guilty and elect for Crown court trial intend to plead guilty later. That means that nearly 6,000 cases are a complete sham from start to finish. It means that the full machinery of the Crown court system has to be put into action. Victims and police are involved, witnesses are warned and a great deal of money is spent - when, in 6,000 cases, the defendant knows from the outset that he intends to plead guilty to the offences charged.</p> <p><b>James Clappison, Conservative MP</b><br> Does not the real unfairness of the bill rest in who will be allowed to have a trial by jury? Will not it benefit the rich, the powerful and the famous who will have the right to trial by jury? Will the home secretary answer the questions he himself asked a few years ago: \"If\u0085 a member of parliament or even a secretary of state were charged with an offence of dishonesty, would they not insist on being tried by a jury? If that is the case, why should others be denied that right of election?\" [1997]</p> <p>The lorry driver, the council employee charged with stealing from the council, the shop assistant alleged to be stealing from her employer, the confused old lady charged with shoplifting, a coal miner charged with stealing coal - I have defended many humble people like that in the course of my career as a member of the bar, and in each case I think that the person concerned should have had the right to a trial by jury. </p> <p>These are the sorts of people most likely to lose the right to a trial by jury. The famous broadcaster, businessman or politician, the member of parliament and certainly the secretary of state, perhaps also the rich man who arrives at the magistrates court with eminent counsel - all those people will get the right to a trial by jury. But the man in the street, who comes from humble origins, has a lower income and perhaps cannot afford counsel at all will not. It is inevitable that, under the proposals, ordinary men and women will lose the right to trial by jury - trial by their peers. They want to exercise that right when something greatly important to them - their reputation for honesty, their livelihood - may be at stake.</p> <p><b>David Davies, Conservative MP</b><br> When the bill was being debated in the other place [the House of Lords] we were told that the savings were \u00a3105 million. Now we are told that the figure is \u00a3128 million. There has been no explanation of that difference. A large proportion of the savings come from a reduction in sentences, which I am not comfortable with when assessing the value of the measure. Those in the other place were also told that there would be no loss of public service jobs. I spend a lot of my time looking at supposed economies in government, and those two claims strike me as inconsistent. I find the proposal implausible in financial terms. </p> <p>We must remember the size of the costs that we are discussing - \u00a39 billion a year. We are now talking about \u00a3128 million, of which a small fraction would be within the judicial system per se. We will never know whether these illusory savings are actually made. Even if they were, if we had to choose between money and justice, surely we would choose justice every time. </p> <p><b>Mark Fisher, Labour MP</b><br> One thing on which everyone I consulted agreed was that they could not understand why the government were proposing the changes now, rather than waiting for the review of the criminal justice system that they themselves established. The review is chaired by Sir Robin Auld and will report later this year. Both magistrates and solicitors in my constituency said that, until they saw the exact scope of Sir Robin's report, we should not be tackling this one, small - albeit very important - part of the criminal justice system. They thought that we should first have the benefit of that overall review of the criminal justice system - much of which they thought could be improved. </p> <p><b>Read the full debate</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/cm000307/debtext/00307-35.htm\" target=\"_new\">7 March: Hansard debate</a></p>",

If cases are serious, they must be proved in front of your fellow citizens. That is the right that you have. That is not an aspersion on magistrates. It is simply a matter of saying that justice must be seen to be done. Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP and lawyer Before trial by jury, England had trial by ordeal, which was certainly summary justice, the scope of which the home secretary is intent on extending. The ordeal often involved submerging people in cold water. If the suspect sank, God had accepted him, and he was innocent. If he bobbed to the surface, however, God had rejected him, and he was guilty. Today, we would call that a catch-22. I suspect that the home secretary, as a born-again Christian, and though constrained by the mores of modern civilisation, has a sneaking admiration for that quick, cost-free kind of summary justice. Jack Straw The bill\u0085 enjoys the active endorsement of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, and of the vast majority of the High Court Bench of nearly 100 senior judges; of the Magistrates Association, representing 30,000 justices of the peace; and of all three police associations, representing more than 125,000 police officers, each of whom has to deal every day with the victims of crime and its perpetrators and who know that justice is not served, either for victim or defendant, by an antiquated and time-wasting procedure, which the bill seeks to remedy. In no sense does the bill undermine the availability of trial by jury for appropriate offences. What it does is to ensure that there is a fairer and more objective basis than the decision of the accused for determining which cases involving the middle range of offences should be so tried. Edward Garnier, Conservative party legal spokesman He [Jack Straw] is not the only man guilty of conspiring to damage the administration of justice. Step forward another lawyer, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield [Mr Blair], who said that it was \"totally unsatisfactory\" to prevent defendants from choosing trial by jury. He said that \"fundamental rights to justice\" could not be \"driven by administrative convenience.\" I agree. Who else agrees with the views then expressed by those three members of the Government? The Criminal Bar Association, the Bar Council, the Association of Magisterial Officers, the Society of Labour Lawyers--every member of the home office apart from the minister of state, the hon. member for Norwich, South [Charles Clarke], may be a member of that august body - the Society of Conservative Lawyers, the Society of Liberal Democrat Lawyers, the Law Society, any number of Crown court and High Court judges to whom I and others have spoken but who cannot speak out publicly, the Legal Action Group, Justice, Liberty, the Institute of Race Relations, the Blackstone Society, the Howard League, the Portia Trust, Professor Lee Bridges - professor of law at Warwick university - Northumbria police, the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, the Quakers and the legal committee of the joint council of Her Majesty's stipendiary magistrates, the Institute of Legal Executives, the Society of Asian Lawyers, the Association of Chief Officers of Probation\u0085. Hazel Blears, Labour MP Research has also shown that 27% of defendants who plead not guilty and elect for Crown court trial intend to plead guilty later. That means that nearly 6,000 cases are a complete sham from start to finish. It means that the full machinery of the Crown court system has to be put into action. Victims and police are involved, witnesses are warned and a great deal of money is spent - when, in 6,000 cases, the defendant knows from the outset that he intends to plead guilty to the offences charged. James Clappison, Conservative MP Does not the real unfairness of the bill rest in who will be allowed to have a trial by jury? Will not it benefit the rich, the powerful and the famous who will have the right to trial by jury? Will the home secretary answer the questions he himself asked a few years ago: \"If\u0085 a member of parliament or even a secretary of state were charged with an offence of dishonesty, would they not insist on being tried by a jury? If that is the case, why should others be denied that right of election?\" [1997] The lorry driver, the council employee charged with stealing from the council, the shop assistant alleged to be stealing from her employer, the confused old lady charged with shoplifting, a coal miner charged with stealing coal - I have defended many humble people like that in the course of my career as a member of the bar, and in each case I think that the person concerned should have had the right to a trial by jury. These are the sorts of people most likely to lose the right to a trial by jury. The famous broadcaster, businessman or politician, the member of parliament and certainly the secretary of state, perhaps also the rich man who arrives at the magistrates court with eminent counsel - all those people will get the right to a trial by jury. But the man in the street, who comes from humble origins, has a lower income and perhaps cannot afford counsel at all will not. It is inevitable that, under the proposals, ordinary men and women will lose the right to trial by jury - trial by their peers. They want to exercise that right when something greatly important to them - their reputation for honesty, their livelihood - may be at stake. David Davies, Conservative MP When the bill was being debated in the other place [the House of Lords] we were told that the savings were \u00a3105 million. Now we are told that the figure is \u00a3128 million. There has been no explanation of that difference. A large proportion of the savings come from a reduction in sentences, which I am not comfortable with when assessing the value of the measure. Those in the other place were also told that there would be no loss of public service jobs. I spend a lot of my time looking at supposed economies in government, and those two claims strike me as inconsistent. I find the proposal implausible in financial terms. We must remember the size of the costs that we are discussing - \u00a39 billion a year. We are now talking about \u00a3128 million, of which a small fraction would be within the judicial system per se. We will never know whether these illusory savings are actually made. Even if they were, if we had to choose between money and justice, surely we would choose justice every time. Mark Fisher, Labour MP One thing on which everyone I consulted agreed was that they could not understand why the government were proposing the changes now, rather than waiting for the review of the criminal justice system that they themselves established. The review is chaired by Sir Robin Auld and will report later this year. Both magistrates and solicitors in my constituency said that, until they saw the exact scope of Sir Robin's report, we should not be tackling this one, small - albeit very important - part of the criminal justice system. They thought that we should first have the benefit of that overall review of the criminal justice system - much of which they thought could be improved. Read the full debate 7 March: Hansard debate",

But in between Saurashtra were shot out for 118, as slow left-armer Gyanendrakumar Pandey finished with 5-39.

Orissa responded with 195, and TN declared their second innings on 309 for 8, as Bhatia, promoted to open, made 60. This left Orissa with the seemingly impossible task of getting 442 to win. But by the time the game ended as a draw, Orissa had reached 311 for 3, with Rashmi Parida undefeated on 147. He added 174 for the second wicket with opener Shiv Das (83).

Former Test opener Blair Pocock scored 56, and Redmond laboured through 40.1 overs for 4-72.

Nikhil Doru made 105, Saket Bhatia 90 and Gagan Khoda 70, but no-one else reached double-figures; slow left-armer Rajesh Pawar picked up 4-93. Earlier, Vinod Kambli had struck 59 to further his claims for a return to the Test side, and Amol Muzumdar 63 as Mumbai totalled 336 in their first innings. Santosh Saxena then claimed 5-56 as Rajasthan replied with 229, before Muzumdar scored another 63, this time unbeaten, in Mumbai's second innings of 285 for 5 declared. Mumbai 336 and 285 for 5 decl. (Sameer Dighe 64, Sanjay Manjrekar 61) Rajasthan 229 (Gagan Khoda 83) and 320 Mumbai won by 72 runs Big hundreds from Dinesh Mongia (179) and Vikram Rathour (158), and nine wickets for former Test offspinner Harbhajan Singh paved the way for Punjab's innings mauling of Bihar at Chandigarh. Punjab declared on 503 for 9 in reply to Bihar's 244, in which Singh took 5-69. He followed this up with 4-68 as Bihar stumbled to 239 in their second innings. Bihar 244 and 239 Punjab 503 for 9 decl. Punjab won by an innings and 20 runs Saurashtra offspinner Nilesh Odedra returned match figures of 10-119 but couldn't prevent his side going down to a 235-run defeat against Uttar Pradesh in the group C game at Rajkot. Odedra took 4-56 in UP's first innings of 206, and 6-63 as UP scored 300 second time round; Mohammad Saif hit 83, and Rizwan Shamshad a run-a-ball 81. But in between Saurashtra were shot out for 118, as slow left-armer Gyanendrakumar Pandey finished with 5-39. They were left needing an unlikely 389 to win, but this time collapsed to Ashish Zaidi, who claimed 6-42; Pandey added 3-44. Uttar Pradesh 206 and 300 Saurashtra 118 and 153 Uttar Pradesh won by 235 runs Tamil Nadu and Orissa fought out a bizarre draw in the other group C match, in Cuttack. First TN were rescued by a last-wicket stand of 137 in their first innings between Rajat Bhatia (72) and Jayaraman Gokulakrishna (59*). Orissa responded with 195, and TN declared their second innings on 309 for 8, as Bhatia, promoted to open, made 60. This left Orissa with the seemingly impossible task of getting 442 to win. But by the time the game ended as a draw, Orissa had reached 311 for 3, with Rashmi Parida undefeated on 147. He added 174 for the second wicket with opener Shiv Das (83). TN stayed top of the group. Tamil Nadu 327 and 309 for 8 decl. Orissa 195 and 311 for 3 Drawn Test batsman Vangipurappu Laxman made 109 and Ammanabrole Nandakishore 119 for Hyderabad but their game with Railways at Delhi ended in a draw as well. Devendra Singh responded with 87, and Railways were eventually set 331 for victory. They opted to bat out their overs instead and closed on 182 for 7, with Kawaljit Singh returning the economical figures of 35-16-40-4. Hyderabad 347 (Balaji Rao 5-56) and 212 for 7 decl. Railways 229 and 182 for 7 (Abhay Sharma 59) Drawn A marathon spell from veteran left-arm spinner Utpal Chatterjee helped Bengal to a first-innings lead in the draw with reigning champions Karnataka. Chatterjee, 35, toiled away for 61.1 overs for figures of 6-102 as Karnataka made 268 in reply to Bengal's 316, which centred on 129* from Syed Karim. Bengal then declared on 264 for 9, with Devang Gandhi hitting 88 and Karim adding 55*, but left Karnataka no time to get the 313 they needed for victory. Bengal 316 (Venkatesh Prasad 4-62) and 264 for 9 decl. Karnataka 268 and 52 for 1 Drawn New Zealand Auckland moved top of the Shell Trophy standings after overcoming bottom-of-the-table Canterbury at the Eden Park Outer Oval in Auckland by six wickets. Canterbury slumped to 187 in their first innings, with only AJ Redmond (72) making an impact, before Auckland replied with 285. Former Test opener Blair Pocock scored 56, and Redmond laboured through 40.1 overs for 4-72. Stephen Fleming (78) and Chris Harris (60*, including three sixes) gave Canterbury hope second time round, but Auckland had little difficulty knocking off 161 to win. Canterbury have yet to gain a point after four matches. Canterbury 187 and 258 (Jarrod Englefield 50, Andre Adams 4-59) Auckland 285 and 161 for 4 (Richard King 57) Auckland won by 6 wickets Jason Wells hit twin hundreds for Wellington in their run-loaded draw with Central Districts at New Plymouth. He began with 107 in Wellington's first innings of 438, adding 186 for the third wicket with SJ Blackmore (88). CD did even better in reply, reaching 468 as Glen Sulzberger registered 159. But Wells then feasted on some declaration bowling to spank 132* from 148 balls; Blackmore thrashed 91 from 56 deliveries with 13 fours and five sixes. The cheap runs allowed Wellington to declare on 331 for 4 and leave CD a target of 302. But a dull game ended without either side getting close to victory as CD finished on 202 for 4, with David Kelly scoring 105. Wellington 438 (Lance Hamilton 5-106) and 331 for 4 decl. Central Districts 468 (David Kelly 62, Craig Spearman 61) and 202 for 4 Drawn How they stand 1 Auckland (Played 4, Points 18), 2 Northern Districts (3, 14), 3 Central Districts (4, 14), 4 Otago (3, 8), 5 Wellington (4, 2), 6 Canterbury (4, 0) Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Today's mayoral special begins with a word of praise to Frank Dobson for celebrating the fact that now, at last, we can put aside the obsession with personalities and get down to the nitty-gritty of policy. Take one of Dobbo's very few guaranteed pledges to the electorate of London. Should he become mayor, he promises that by 2004 four out of five London households will have access to the internet. Hats off, Dobbo! Eager to read more of his policy commitment, we make straight for Frank's own website at <a href=\"http://www.frank-dobson.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.frank-dobson.org.uk</a> - and would you believe it, Frank takes the net so seriously that the site hasn't been updated since February 16. Nowhere does it mention that Frank won the Labour ballot, let alone that Ken is running. What it does say, on the transport front, is that Frank remains utterly committed to a public-private partnership to fund the tube, and won't countenance private bonds. Thank God Frank is making such a strong early showing in the polls, or you'd begin to wonder about morale in his camp.</p> <p>\u0095 You will recall how yesterday we asked Dobbo to specify the firms he had in mind that, he claimed, were having second thoughts about their plans to invest in London through fear of Ken's mayoralty. Well, Radio 4's World at One had the same thought yesterday, and rang the Dobbo camp, which couldn't name a single firm but mentioned a Sunday Times article (pulled, we discover, after the first edition) quoting \"a CBI source\" saying that Ken would scare off business. Mmm. But when we ring the CBI, it says: \"We don't have any views on the subject,\" according to a press officer. \"We have no evidence that companies are reconsidering investing in London depending upon who is mayor.\" Aha.</p> <p>\u0095 Meanwhile, how interesting to note, as did my so-called rival in the Telegraph, that on the very day the paper's ultra-Blairite columnist Sion Simon raised the prospect of New Labour using Joe Louis's \"you can run but you can't hide\" taunt, Dobbo began to use the line himself. Ah well, let's just be grateful that Frank is distancing himself from that absurd \"Tony's poodle\" caricature.</p> <p>\u0095 In the last couple of days, we have received an amazing number of calls from people (primarily outside London) eager to contact the Livingstone campaign, and asking for the address. It is: Livingstone for London, PO Box 20052, London NW2 5ZH.</p> <p>\u0095 Dobbo's gift for mimicry stretches beyond Joe Louis, of course. He's even better at Clint Eastwood ... so here, by popular request, is that Dirty Harry speech in full. \"Now I do believe I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, in all this commotion, I can't quite recall. Sally, love, would you ring Margaret and check. What's that, dear? Five, was it? Does Tony agree? Ooooh, you amaze me, I've got one left! Now where was I? Ah yes. Ken, being as this is a Magnum .44 - or is it a .45? I'd forget me own name if it wasn't on me bus pass!

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Today's mayoral special begins with a word of praise to Frank Dobson for celebrating the fact that now, at last, we can put aside the obsession with personalities and get down to the nitty-gritty of policy. Take one of Dobbo's very few guaranteed pledges to the electorate of London. Should he become mayor, he promises that by 2004 four out of five London households will have access to the internet. Hats off, Dobbo! Eager to read more of his policy commitment, we make straight for Frank's own website at www.frank-dobson.org.uk - and would you believe it, Frank takes the net so seriously that the site hasn't been updated since February 16. Nowhere does it mention that Frank won the Labour ballot, let alone that Ken is running. What it does say, on the transport front, is that Frank remains utterly committed to a public-private partnership to fund the tube, and won't countenance private bonds. Thank God Frank is making such a strong early showing in the polls, or you'd begin to wonder about morale in his camp. \u0095 You will recall how yesterday we asked Dobbo to specify the firms he had in mind that, he claimed, were having second thoughts about their plans to invest in London through fear of Ken's mayoralty. Well, Radio 4's World at One had the same thought yesterday, and rang the Dobbo camp, which couldn't name a single firm but mentioned a Sunday Times article (pulled, we discover, after the first edition) quoting \"a CBI source\" saying that Ken would scare off business. Mmm. But when we ring the CBI, it says: \"We don't have any views on the subject,\" according to a press officer. \"We have no evidence that companies are reconsidering investing in London depending upon who is mayor.\" Aha. \u0095 Meanwhile, how interesting to note, as did my so-called rival in the Telegraph, that on the very day the paper's ultra-Blairite columnist Sion Simon raised the prospect of New Labour using Joe Louis's \"you can run but you can't hide\" taunt, Dobbo began to use the line himself. Ah well, let's just be grateful that Frank is distancing himself from that absurd \"Tony's poodle\" caricature. \u0095 In the last couple of days, we have received an amazing number of calls from people (primarily outside London) eager to contact the Livingstone campaign, and asking for the address. It is: Livingstone for London, PO Box 20052, London NW2 5ZH. \u0095 Dobbo's gift for mimicry stretches beyond Joe Louis, of course. He's even better at Clint Eastwood ... so here, by popular request, is that Dirty Harry speech in full. \"Now I do believe I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, in all this commotion, I can't quite recall. Sally, love, would you ring Margaret and check. What's that, dear? Five, was it? Does Tony agree? Ooooh, you amaze me, I've got one left! Now where was I? Ah yes. Ken, being as this is a Magnum .44 - or is it a .45? I'd forget me own name if it wasn't on me bus pass! Sally! would you, petal? ... a Magnum .44, the most powerful handgun in the world, you must ask yourself one question: do I feel, um, do you, er ... Sally? Salll-lllly!\" Tomorrow, Frank tackles the \"You talkin' to me?\" speech from Taxi Driver. \u0095 A reader in Watford reports receiving his \"Now you can vote for Mayor of London\" leaflet from Patsy Prescott's department of the regions. Baffled by this, what with Watford being in Hertfordshire rather than greater London, he rang the DETR to ask what the hell was going on. \"Oh no, you can't possibly vote for the London mayor,\" a censorious voice corrected him. \"You live in Watford.\" \u0095 Paul Boateng has been a delight this week parroting the anti-Livingstone line to anyone who will listen.

The unassuming 25-year-old with the pudding-bowl haircut belongs in the hills of West Virginia - where he was born, raised and home-schooled on a farm - not amid the ostentatious intellectualism of Yale University. It's not that he isn't clever enough to study law at Yale: quite the opposite. It's just that the quiet passion with which he speaks of his parents' hillside home makes it plain that part of him would much rather be there than in New Haven, Connecticut, pursuing his current path - one that has seen him labelled everything from the saviour of American youth to a self-righteous moraliser, a trumped-up intellectual wunderkind and a fraud. </p> <p>Literary celebrity may not be in short supply in America but, even so, Purdy seems a fantastically unlikely person to have garnered so much of it so quickly. His backwoods background hardly equipped him with the connections necessary for a stellar early career as a cultural barometer. But he made it to Harvard, penned a heartfelt manuscript, landed a $75,000 book deal with New York publishing megalith Random House and a few months later finds himself a bestselling author struggling under the burden of being anointed America's latest, and youngest, young sage. </p> <p>He's spent the last three months fitting radio and television interviews into his packed law school schedule. \"It's been a very disorienting time,\" he says. \"The quantity and tone of attention paid to the book is something I suppose I might have anticipated if I'd thought about it - but I just didn't anticipate at all.\" </p> <p>The Trouble With America, as Purdy sees it, is Seinfeld. Or, at least, that much-mourned sitcom is the most sacred of sacred cows he chooses to attack in his strikingly eloquent monograph, For Common Things. (The ultra-hip cyberculture magazine Wired and the MTV cartoon Beavis and Butthead are among countless others.) All, he argues, are symptoms of a corrosive irony stalking American culture, a detachment that is suffocating community and obliterating all hope of using politics to change the world - \"an insistent flatness, a wary, ironic, sceptical stance towards all things . . . quiet refusal to believe in the depths of relationships, the sincerity of motivation or the truth of speech\". In its place, Purdy argues passionately for a reinvigoration of grassroots political action, for \"declaring the value of hopes we know to be fragile\": trust, commitment, obligation. </p> <p>It's hard to imagine a stance more out of tune with fashionable thinking. As Purdy puts it: \"I stepped face first into the zeitgeist.\" </p> <p>Saturation coverage in pillars of the US media - the New York Times magazine, Harper's, Time, the Washington Post, Salon - followed the book's publication last autumn, and Purdy has opened a rift in opinion that speaks volumes about the current preoccupations of the American intelligentsia. Veteran newspapermen and academics have grown weak at the knees, breathing audible sighs of relief at the possibility that Generation X may not be the lost cause they had feared. A glowing New York Times feature labelled Purdy the harbinger of \"The New Sincerity\", a \"fair-haired boy who not only professes decency but exudes it from every respectful pore\". Robert Kuttner, co-editor of the American Prospect, the liberal journal which first discovered Purdy, is similarly breathless. \"He's the genuine article,\" Kuttner has said. \"Modesty and astonishing talent are what make him a star. Jed walked in the door and just blew our socks off. It was hard to believe he was from Earth.\" His publishers have energetically encouraged the perception of Purdy as a youthful 21st-century incarnation of the American poet and natural philosopher Henry David Thoreau - and it seems to be working. </p> <p>But to say that Purdy's plea for a renewed engagement with civic life has got some people's backs up would be a massive understatement. A seething Harper's review accused Purdy of \"unctuous sentimentality\"; the New York Observer said his book was \"bloated with bombast\". Salon, meanwhile, labelled him a purveyor of \"intellectual fogy porn\": Purdy, \"in his bangs and cotton sweater with no shirt\", wrote critic Caleb Crain, \"has not dislodged irony with faith. He has dislodged it with sly, disingenuous, manipulative pseudo-sincerity.\" It was the Vancouver Sun, though, which found the best expression for the combination of naivete and condescension that seems to have riled so many people, comparing Purdy to \"a Tibetan monk lecturing about wife-swapping\". </p> <p>In person, it's hard to believe he's capable of aggravating anyone. Far from the humourless preacher he's held to be, Purdy is compulsively self-deprecating and borders on the giggly. The bit about him never stopping talking turns out to be accurate, though. </p> <p>\"Something I've realised since writing the book is that it invites being read as a self-righteous series of moral pronouncements, as a declaration that I have had the good fortune to lead a virtuous and morally instructive life, and that this qualifies me to decry the failings of my contemporaries, my elders, and really anyone who comes into my sights,\" he says, in one of the rambling, clause-strewn sentences he employs for speaking and writing alike. \"That would be obnoxious, and to the extent that that is what people took it to be, I'm in sympathy with their impulse to excoriate it.\" </p> <p>There is some justification in the hostility Purdy has aroused. For a start, his parents weren't farmers by ancestry, but middle-class members of the 1970s back-to-the-earth \"neo-homesteading\" movement, and the passionate tirade against commercial strip-mining in West Virginia which forms the strongest part of the book looks a little less convincing in that light. Others have detected hypocrisy in the fact that his role model for grassroots political activism is his mother, because of her work on the Purdys' local school board - and yet she chose to educate Jedediah and his sister at home. </p> <p> Then again, in the context of the current presidential campaign, a blast of Purdyesque sincerity may be exactly what is needed. If John McCain - an arch-conservative, anti-abortionist, anti-gay republican - can win the admiration of liberals simply by being authentic in his arch-conservatism, sincerity is clearly in dangerously short supply. Purdy, too (a liberal through and through, despite charges of neoconservatism) is evidently speaking to such a need. \"McCain puts everyone on notice that sham candidates, like Bush, won't be sufficient - that all those despairing propositions about politics that he stands for aren't enough,\" he says. </p> <p>One problem he hasn't had to face, though, is the mockery of his classmates. Yale law students are a high-powered lot, destined for some of the best-paid jobs America has to offer. Purdy, on the other hand, plans a career in the far less lucrative arenas of writing and environmental advocacy, and his peers see little to be jealous of. \"I get a little mild teasing,\" he says, \"but they basically just think I'm a sucker anyhow.\" </p> <p>For Common Things is published in the US by Random House, price $20. <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com\">www.randomhouse.com</a></p>",

He was a scrupulously literary soul, and I bet the Buzzcocks song Boredom (featured on the newly released 1976 recording Time's Up) would have been called l'Ennui, except that \"l'ennui - b'dum b'dum\" didn't have quite the same ring. Dostoevsky references also came thick and fast: one Magazine song lamented, \"I coulda been Raskolnikov but Mother Nature ripped me off.\" </p> <p>In Britain, Devoto was the first and most unashamed in a line of what the NME called pallid young things with Penguin Modern Classics in their pockets. It may have looked arch, but for many the literary dandyism was absolutely sincere, and Devoto was not alone. What's often forgotten about early punk is how much literary Europhilia fed into the imagery, especially in the US. I seem to remember that the episode of So It Goes that introduced the Sex Pistols to British television also featured a rant from Patti Smith, name-checking a figure otherwise overlooked by punk iconography: Th\u00e9ophile Gautier (1811-72). </p> <p>Gautier, Romantic poet turned advocate of formal perfectionism, had two characteristics that qualified him as an early new-wave icon: his enthusiasm for narcotic hallucination and his appearance at the riot on the opening night of Victor Hugo's play Hernani (1830), at which he distinguished himself as a flag-bearer of Romanticism's scandalous new spirit by wearing a pink waistcoat. Gautier's only other imprint on the British school of 1976 was when ex-Subway Sect singer Vic Godard announced his intention to write a musical based on Gautier's transvestite novel Mademoiselle de Maupin. </p> <p>The mid-70s wannabohemians realised that if you needed role models to help you hone your existential pique, then the Stones, the Stooges, even Question Mark and the Mysterians weren't enough: you had to call in the literary heavyweights. The most committed lit-punks were found in New York. When Patti Smith's debut LP Horses featured the line \"Go Johnny go, and go Rimbaud!\", it was a signal for a generation to hit the library. For her, the blessed Arthur was foremost among proto-rock star poets: precocious genius, youthful beauty, scandalous Camden Town m\u00e9nage with older lover Verlaine, poetic career curtailed for a stint of gun-running and an early death. </p> <p>Other Manhattanites chose more recherch\u00e9 idols. Rimbaud was real, but a fictional hero was even cooler: Richard Hell, formerly of Television, shared with Devoto the cult of Des Esseintes, aesthete anti-hero of Joris-Karl Huysmans's 1884 novel A Rebours (Against Nature). Decadent indulgences apart, Des Esseintes's greatest moment is a prescient vision of theme-park culture: an abortive trip to England that finds him stuck in Paris, eating roast beef and drinking warm beer, and realising that a real visit could never equal the ersatz experience. He'd only have ended up in the Safeway queue with Devoto. </p> <p>Hell's other hero was Isidore Ducasse, whose steely, delirious prose poem Les Chants de Maldoror still makes Crash and American Psycho look like soft options. The fact that, for years, no one was entirely sure who Ducasse himself was, commentators invariably conflating him with his pseudonym \"Lautr\u00e9amont\" and his demonic hero-narrator Maldoror, made him an exemplary role model for boho rockers trying to evolve their own exotic, disposable alter egos. </p> <p>Where did it go, this literary fan worship? Was it ridiculed out of existence? Perhaps it was just that the mid-70s were the last time the phenomenon could happen with any plausibility: a time when marginal or \"rebel\" writing had not yet been commodified and consigned to the cult literature shelves in book superstores, when a dog-eared paperback edition of Lautr\u00e9amont or Gautier was as prized as a Stooges bootleg. These books needed to be dug out, and were distinctly darker than, say, Hermann Hesse, the soft stuff that was on the hippies' counter-culture reading list. </p> <p>The booklet that comes with Richard Hell's newly re-released Blank Generation CD features a mugshot of Edgar Allan Poe among the collage of band photos. That sums up the spirit of the time: literary forebears as pin-ups, scrapbook heroes that people wanted to be. You could imagine Patti Smith kissing her Rimbaud picture every night, or Hell practising Baudelaire's scowl in the mirror. Poor old Gautier, though - bearded and jowly, he never quite caught on as a role model. </p> <p>The Buzzcocks' Time's Up is released on Mute; Richard Hell and the Voidoids' Blank Generation is out now on Sire/Warner Bros.</p>",

Decadent indulgences apart, Des Esseintes's greatest moment is a prescient vision of theme-park culture: an abortive trip to England that finds him stuck in Paris, eating roast beef and drinking warm beer, and realising that a real visit could never equal the ersatz experience. He'd only have ended up in the Safeway queue with Devoto. Hell's other hero was Isidore Ducasse, whose steely, delirious prose poem Les Chants de Maldoror still makes Crash and American Psycho look like soft options. The fact that, for years, no one was entirely sure who Ducasse himself was, commentators invariably conflating him with his pseudonym \"Lautr\u00e9amont\" and his demonic hero-narrator Maldoror, made him an exemplary role model for boho rockers trying to evolve their own exotic, disposable alter egos. Where did it go, this literary fan worship? Was it ridiculed out of existence? Perhaps it was just that the mid-70s were the last time the phenomenon could happen with any plausibility: a time when marginal or \"rebel\" writing had not yet been commodified and consigned to the cult literature shelves in book superstores, when a dog-eared paperback edition of Lautr\u00e9amont or Gautier was as prized as a Stooges bootleg. These books needed to be dug out, and were distinctly darker than, say, Hermann Hesse, the soft stuff that was on the hippies' counter-culture reading list. The booklet that comes with Richard Hell's newly re-released Blank Generation CD features a mugshot of Edgar Allan Poe among the collage of band photos. That sums up the spirit of the time: literary forebears as pin-ups, scrapbook heroes that people wanted to be. You could imagine Patti Smith kissing her Rimbaud picture every night, or Hell practising Baudelaire's scowl in the mirror. Poor old Gautier, though - bearded and jowly, he never quite caught on as a role model. The Buzzcocks' Time's Up is released on Mute; Richard Hell and the Voidoids' Blank Generation is out now on Sire/Warner Bros.",

      "body": "<p>John Prescott paved the way for a new building boom in the south-east last night by approving plans for 215,000 new houses over the next five years, alongside a further 115,000 in Greater London.</p> <p>Facing unprecedented demand for new, lower cost homes, and the wrath of countryside campaigners, the deputy prime minister tried to soften the blow with strict planning guidelines.</p> <p>These will give councils powers to force builders to redevelop recycled land - so-called brownfield sites - and convert empty buildings to flats before turning to greenfield sites.</p> <p>But the shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman, claimed the plans - representing a 10% increase in south-east house building annually and a 22% rise in London - would lead to more congestion, threaten the countryside, and choke villages and small towns.</p> <p>Mr Prescott said that by rejecting recommendations from his own advisers for 1.1m additional homes in the south-east up to 2016, in favour of regular five-year reviews, he was steering a sensible middle course and would be saving 42 square miles of countryside.</p> <p>The plans represent a more cautious approach to meeting the huge demand for homes. The booming property market in central London is fuelling the crisis, coupled with the spiralling divorce rate and greater longevity.</p> <p>The Council for the Protection of Rural England hailed Mr Prescott's initiative as a policy watershed and an historic breakthrough in planning policy. Tony Burton, assistant director of the council, said: \"The new policy will halve the amount of rural land which could be developed over the next five years.\"</p> <p>The key to preventing excessive building on greenfield sites - many of which are already in builders' 'land banks' - is the development of what amounts to a new 'linear city' along the Thames from Greenwich east to Dartford and the Medway.

      "bodyText": "John Prescott paved the way for a new building boom in the south-east last night by approving plans for 215,000 new houses over the next five years, alongside a further 115,000 in Greater London. Facing unprecedented demand for new, lower cost homes, and the wrath of countryside campaigners, the deputy prime minister tried to soften the blow with strict planning guidelines. These will give councils powers to force builders to redevelop recycled land - so-called brownfield sites - and convert empty buildings to flats before turning to greenfield sites. But the shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman, claimed the plans - representing a 10% increase in south-east house building annually and a 22% rise in London - would lead to more congestion, threaten the countryside, and choke villages and small towns. Mr Prescott said that by rejecting recommendations from his own advisers for 1.1m additional homes in the south-east up to 2016, in favour of regular five-year reviews, he was steering a sensible middle course and would be saving 42 square miles of countryside. The plans represent a more cautious approach to meeting the huge demand for homes. The booming property market in central London is fuelling the crisis, coupled with the spiralling divorce rate and greater longevity. The Council for the Protection of Rural England hailed Mr Prescott's initiative as a policy watershed and an historic breakthrough in planning policy. Tony Burton, assistant director of the council, said: \"The new policy will halve the amount of rural land which could be developed over the next five years.\" The key to preventing excessive building on greenfield sites - many of which are already in builders' 'land banks' - is the development of what amounts to a new 'linear city' along the Thames from Greenwich east to Dartford and the Medway. Mr Prescott is also keen to expand Ashford, in Kent, into a big new town to serve the Channel tunnel alongside further expansion of Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. In the longer term, building might be allowed along the M11 corridor, around Stansted in Essex. But the House Builders' Federation, fearing that new planning guidelines might stifle development, implied that insufficient homes might be built to satisfy demand from key workers - such as teachers, nurses and police officers - currently priced out of the market. \"Without providing for future generations, the continued prosperity of the region and the country as a whole will be seriously at risk.\" Mr Prescott told the Commons that the balance of new housing had to move from big detached houses, and semis, to smaller homes for single people. 'Singles' would contitute 70% of the housing market over the next 20 years. Mr Norman claimed that Mr Prescott's plan would lead to almost 900,000 new homes over the next 20 years. \"No matter how hard he tries to scramble the arithmetic, nothing can disguise the sheer volume of housing being imposed against the wishes of local councils.\" Mr Prescott referred to Mr Norman's period as chief of the Asda supermarket chain. \"He was the director of a company that led the growth of out-of-town shopping centres ... there was more land taken in green belts by Asda and the out-of-town shopping industry than any other development in this country.\" Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat environment spokes-man, described Mr Prescott's \"optimistic\" targets for building on brownfield sites as \"whistling in the wind\".

Like the victims of sanctions, they are mercilessly exploited by Saddam's propagandists.</p> <p>Ten years on, Saddam's envoys have succeeded in destroying the security council consensus. France has joined permanent members Russia and China in undermining Anglo-American policy. Iraq is also making steady advances in its return to the Arab and regional fold. Last month it signed a trade deal with Turkey. A Syrian interests section has opened in Baghdad and there is talk of reopening the Iraqi-Syrian oil pipeline shut since 1982. Leading Jordanians launch a pan-Arab campaign to normalise relations; this week, Baghdad's representatives will attend an Arab League meeting in Beirut. Meanwhile, the open flouting of the sanctions regime proceeds apace. Supplies, licit and illicit, for Iraq's elite flow across the land borders. Turkey is said to be illegally importing 1.1m barrels of Iraqi oil. US naval commanders in the Gulf report a sharp increase in Iraqi oil smuggling, facilitated by the Russians and the Iranians. Rising oil prices are another uncomfortable indicator of Saddam's returning strength: Iraq, after all, has the world's largest proven crude reserves after Saudi Arabia.

The Clinton administration's attempts to mobilise Iraqi opposition groups, and the CIA's covert efforts to overthrow the Iraqi leader, have at best been half-hearted. The US now seems to have almost given up trying. In a broader sense, the policy of \"dual containment\" of both Iraq and Iran has unravelled. Despite continuing tough posturing from its ambassador, Richard Holbrooke, the US has lost the argument at the UN. The latest resolution proposes progressively to ease sanctions after weapons inspections are satisfactorily resumed for an initial 120 days. Iraq's flat refusal to accept these conditions would at one time have quickly been squashed. Now most countries seem to sympathise with Baghdad. The new chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix, may make a difference. But while technically successful, the inspection process remains a political minefield. Meanwhile, the recent resignation of Hans von Sponeck, over the inadequacy of the UN's oil-for-food programme for which he was responsible, marked a new low. In vain do US and British officials insist that it is Saddam who is responsible for his people's agony. The finger of blame is pointed at them.</p> <p>Ten years on, the struggle with Saddam has indeed become the mother of all battles. But it is clear that, infinitely difficult though it is, one more big push to cut a sanctions-inspections deal with Iraq is required. It is true that the unstated purpose of sanctions was to punish, isolate, and ultimately bring down Saddam. This policy has utterly and demonstrably failed. The human cost has been, and is, horrendous. Few believe it is morally justifiable. Even fewer believe it will ever work. But it is also true that an abandonment of the attempt to deny Iraq its weapons of mass destruction would be grossly irresponsible, surrendering the little leverage the outside world still has. It would ensure that Saddam, sooner or later, could again threaten his neighbours and perhaps western Europe. It would be a gamble with the security not only of the Middle East but of any part of the world where \"rogue\" dictators roam. To drop sanctions without conditions or fulfilment of security council resolutions, as Baghdad insists, would be to shatter the credibility of the UN and the ethos which has underpinned intervention elsewhere. And it would triumphantly secure Saddam at home, guaranteeing perhaps an even more iniquitous oppression of Kurds, Shia, and others who oppose him. His claims that there are no more weapons to find simply cannot be taken at face value. For Saddam is a murderous, reckless man, in all probability a psychopath, who cares nothing for others.

      "bodyText": "Pieter Boogaart is used to eyes glazing over as he explains the subject of his book: the past splendours and present glories of the A272, a road which straggles for 90 miles through Hampshire and Sussex. \"It has three digits in its name, that's really quite remarkable for an A-road,\" he says. For the past 10 years Mr Boogaart, a Dutch language teacher, has spent his holidays walking, cycling and driving every foot of the road. He has spent months in bed and breakfasts along the route, and scrambled through nettle patches and over barbed wire fences to inspect anything of interest. His book lists every road, railway track (current and long gone) and footpath which intersects the A272, and where it is crossed by the Greenwich meridian (near Newick). At Dragons Green crossroads in West Sussex he was able to point to a hall where the young Dirk Bogarde performed in amateur dramatics, and the oak tree un der which Pope wrote The Rape of the Lock. Millionaires and free-range egg producers have been astounded and flattered by his interest, and welcomed him in for tea and local history. One of the few doors which remained closed belonged to the National Trust, which owns the palatial Petworth House, and its Capability Brown park. \"I knew the house was closed for the season, but I knocked on the door and asked if I could possibly see the ice house. It was snowing. The door was closed and I remained standing outside until somebody came back and said 'no', and closed the door again.\" Road engineers insist the A272 is less than a century old, but Mr Boogaart remains true to his quest to prove it is a pilgrim's route from Winchester to Canterbury. He lists every Angel hotel and pub on the route as evidence. \u0095 A272, An Ode to a Road, published by Pallas Athene, \u00a314.95",

      "bodyText": "Prosecutors must consider taking wife beaters to court even if their victims withdraw their complaints, under new guidelines on combating domestic violence published by the home office yesterday. The crown prosecution service guidance - launched to coincide with International Women's Day - advised that, while the wishes of the victim should be taken into account in any prosecution, they \"cannot be the final word\" in deciding whether or not to press charges. The document also called on local authorities to evict domestic abusers. Groups campaigning against domestic violence welcomed the guidelines and a 10-point plan for agencies tackling domestic violence announced by the home office minister, Paul Boateng. Although home office figures suggest that one in four women will experience domestic violence at some point, many prosecutions are dropped because the victims are intimidated. Under the new guidelines, when a woman withdraws her evidence, prosecutors must take into account factors such as whether it is in the wider public interest to pursue the case. Mr Boateng said the guidelines were part of a package of measures aimed at tackling domestic violence. He said: \"As a result of domestic violence around 63,000 women and children spend at least one night in a refuge and one woman is dying every three days. We have a moral duty to make sure we make serious inroads in tackling this horrendous problem.\"",

It is also developing a package called SurfTime for users to surf the net on an unmetered basis for \u00a334.99 a month plus VAT. </p> <p>The onslaught of service providers such as Freeserve, AOL UK and AltaVista which offer free unmetered access, threatens BT's internet market share, said Doug Wight, an analyst at Commerzbank AG. </p> <p>\"I think the competition will bring down prices in parallel with the US,\" said Mr Wight, who predicted that the emergence of faster internet connections in the next year would lead some customers to prefer metered access to the web rather than a monthly fee. </p> <p>Government dissatisfaction with BT's internet charges comes at a bad time for the company. It has been overtaken by European former state monopolies and is considering a management shake-up and the float of businesses such as Cellnet, its mobile phones network, to boost its value.

BT has an internet package priced at \u00a36.99 per month that offers customers a flat rate and unlimited access at night and at the weekend. It is also developing a package called SurfTime for users to surf the net on an unmetered basis for \u00a334.99 a month plus VAT. The onslaught of service providers such as Freeserve, AOL UK and AltaVista which offer free unmetered access, threatens BT's internet market share, said Doug Wight, an analyst at Commerzbank AG. \"I think the competition will bring down prices in parallel with the US,\" said Mr Wight, who predicted that the emergence of faster internet connections in the next year would lead some customers to prefer metered access to the web rather than a monthly fee. Government dissatisfaction with BT's internet charges comes at a bad time for the company. It has been overtaken by European former state monopolies and is considering a management shake-up and the float of businesses such as Cellnet, its mobile phones network, to boost its value. Probably not something Mr Blair contemplated when in opposition.",

The combined foreign aid pledge from at least 16 western and African governments has risen to more than $100m, including emergency relief and money for long-term recon struction. Washington is also proposing greater debt relief for Mozambique. But Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, yesterday pleaded for more assistance: \"Let me appeal to the whole world to give them as much help as possible, and as soon as possible,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "An influential Wall Street analyst indicated yesterday that Microsoft wanted to reach a swift settlement of its anti-trust battle with the US government. Rick Sherlund, technology analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a note to investors that the settlement talks with an independent mediator \"may be heating up as we near the end\" and he was \"hopeful\" that an agreement would be reached. He predicted that such a settlement would lift the group's share price, which has been depressed by the legal battle in the past two months. Shares in Microsoft rose 6% to more than $96 at midday yesterday, valuing the company at more than $500bn (\u00a3323bn). Mr Sherlund, who helped take Microsoft public 13 years ago, issued the note after a meeting with Microsoft's new chief financial officer.

She was 43 and a senior partner in a Liverpool law firm. In October, 1998, he slipped the poison in her gin and tonic nightcap in room 508 of the New Winter Palace in Luxor.</p> <p>The gin was to mask the taste of sodium cyanide.

Sumer, 41, from Brentford, west London, was also cleared of aiding and abetting Herbert to disclose information. Herbert, 31, from Twickenham, west London, had access to what police described as the \"crown jewels\" of CPS prosecutions, involving terrorism and official secrets cases. Said to be one of the worst potential breaches of security in the service's history, the CPS has been forced to change its computer system after the case. An independent review of security recommended a series of improvements which were being implemented, the CPS said yesterday. \"The CPS is putting more resources into security ... However, no system can insure against a breach of integrity by a member of staff,\" a spokesman said. Herbert, a policeman's son, joined the CPS in 1992, moving to the service's headquarters in 1998, where he became part of a confidential team under a senior lawyer, Michael Spong, which was dealing exclusively with the Adams family. Under the umbrella code-name Operation Trinity, the team was investigating a wide range of criminal activities engaged in by the family and their associates, including armed robbery and drug smuggling.

At the time Herbert was smuggling documents out of the central London offices of the CPS, Tommy Adams was facing a drugs trafficking trial. He was subsequently jailed for 7 years after pleading guilty. A memo from the prosecutor in the case, which discussed whether there was sufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution as well as police reluctance to disclose surveillance techniques in open court, was the first document Herbert smuggled out. He also obtained details of a case against an alleged Adams family \"enforcer\" who was accused of a knife attack on a businessman over \u00a31.4m he was given to invest by one of the brothers. The businessman was left with his ear and nose hanging off after his face was slashed with a Stanley knife.

      "bodyText": "Channel 4 placed at risk the lives of \"decent people\" when it broadcast a documentary about a spate of loyalist murders, Northern Ireland's first minister, David Trimble, said in the high court yesterday. The Nobel peace prize winner claimed the 1991 Dispatches programme, The Committee, had suggested members of the Ulster Independence Committee, a political movement dedicated to Ulster's independence, were connected to an alleged committee of Protestant dignitaries and RUC officers who colluded with loyalist death squads to arrange the murders of innocent Catholics. The \"dishonest\" way in which the programme had been edited - with quotes from the IUC's head, the Reverend Hugh Ross, juxtaposed with an interview with a loyalist fanatic - compounded this impression. \"By doing a programme about this alleged committee that was responsible for murders and in the same context mixing in Hugh Ross's group, known in Northern Ireland as the Ulster Independence Committee, that exposed to attack members of Hugh Ross's committee,\" the Ulster Unionist leader said. \"While I wasn't a supporter, or associated with Hugh Ross's committee, there were people on that committee that I knew, whom I knew to be decent people and whose lives, I thought, had been placed at risk by Channel 4.\" Mr Trimble was giving evidence for the Sunday Times in its defence of a libel action brought by the documentary's producer, Sean McPhilemy, over a 1993 article deriding the film as a hoax based on \"unsubstantiated rumours and fabrications\" from its main source, a loyalist fanatic, Jim Sands. The programme had alleged that the committee had arranged, with the collusion of the RUC, for Protestant death squads to carry out the killings of Catholics and republicans. No one was named, but in a book of the same name published in the US two years ago, Mr McPhilemy listed the alleged members and accused Mr Trimble of involvement. The Upper Bann MP was \"knowingly associating with and assisting those responsible for the murder of his own constituents\", he said, and was as culpable for terrorist acts as the leader of Sinn Fein. Yesterday Mr Trimble, who is pursuing a separate libel action against the internet firm Amazon UK, which distributes the book in Britain, denied there was \"a shred of truth\" in such allegations. He said: \"To say that I was knowingly associating with and assisting people responsible for the murder of my constituents is grossly offensive to me and would be extremely damaging but for the fact that I have not met anybody in Northern Ireland who takes this book seriously.\" He denied it was merely his \"entourage\" who dismissed the allegations. They were so \"incredible\" that not even the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, or its chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, believed them. Mr Trimble insisted the Orange Order, of which he had been a member since 1961, was a fraternal organisation which did not promote sectarianism. James Price QC, for Mr McPhilemy, said that \"fraternal\" was not a word that sprang to mind in the light of its insistence on marching in uniform through nationalist areas - and asked if it was true that, after a silent march at Drumcree in 1995, he had danced a celebratory jig with the DUP leader, the Rev Ian Paisley. Mr Trimble replied: \"I have never danced a jig with anyone, least of all Ian Paisley. There was something you could describe as rejoicing, and yes, I did put my hands together with Mr Paisley - but we certainly weren't dancing.\" The hearing, in which the Sunday Times denies libel and pleads justification, continues.",

You must have then watched her suffer until she was beyond making any complaint. \"In my view it is clear you were motivated by greed and in my own mind I am satisfied that you forged her will and were determined to take for yourself virtually her entire property.\" The life sentence would be accompanied by a recommendation to the home secretary that Allan should stay in prison for a long time. \"The loss of a daughter or sister in the prime of her life is a personal tragedy for any family. But to lose her in circumstances where you really did not know what had happened to her must have been a torment.\" Cheryl's father, Eric Lewis, wept at the verdict and hugged his eldest daughter. He said afterwards: \"All we as a family have wanted is justice for Cheryl. I thank God that justice has prevailed.\" Jennifer Hughes, a wealthy divorcee and friend of Cheryl Lewis who began a sexual relationship with Allan within weeks of her friend's death, said: \"I feel relief for Cheryl Lewis's family who have been through a terrible ordeal. I am very relieved that it is all over.\" Detective Superintendent David Smith, of Merseyside police, who led the inquiry, said: \"I feel very pleased for the family because they have gone through a tremendous ordeal. \"When someone is dying and the person you rely on most for help is denying you that help, it must have been most difficult for the family to understand.\" Allan was a very dangerous man. \"I feel the sentence makes the community a great deal safer.\"",

He acknowledged, however, that his refusal over the transmission may have freedom of speech implications under the European convention on human rights. There has been intense interest in televising the trial, which broadcasters say could reach a potential global audience of more than 100m. Lawyers for the BBC and eight other broadcasters, including CNN, had argued that the unique international significance of the event, due to take place under Scots law, gave it a special status. They said the fact that agreement had already been given for the relatives' screenings meant consent to the principle of broadcasting the trial had effectively been approved. The two Libyans accused of the bombing, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmmed al-Megrahi, 47, and Al Ali Lamine Khalifa Fhimah, 43, have denied charges of conspiracy and murder over the disaster, in which 270 people died after their plane exploded over Lockerbie in December 1988. Lord MacFadyen said, in his ruling, that he agreed that televising proceedings would pose a greater risk of prejudice to the administration of justice than would occur in ordinary criminal cases. The BBC had argued that refusing their request could run counter to freedom of expression considerations under the European convention on human rights.

Margaret Mark said she feared her daughter could lose her home over the legal action. Speaking about the injunction and claim for damages by Cherie Blair against her daughter, she said she felt she no longer had the full support of the Blairs. \"We are all devastated about what has happened. Tony and Cherie Blair say they are trying to protect their children. Well now I am trying to protect mine.\" The prime minister's official spokesman last night denied suggestions that Ms Mark could lose her home, describing the damages claim as a \"legal technicality\". He said: \"All they are seeking to do is prevent publication of material about their family life and to get return of the manuscript.\" Mrs Mark, from Galgate, near Lancaster, said the Blairs had initially said they would help them get through the situation. But she said: \"I can no longer stand back as my daughter is made out to be some sort of evil money grabber intent on causing the Blairs grief.\" Mrs Mark said the stories included in her daughter's book would only have shown how nice the Blairs had been to her family. She insisted that the book would not have been published without the Blairs' consent. When her daughter began working for the Blairs she and her son Tom moved into their Islington home, and then later No 10, where her son worked as an unofficial butler while pursuing an acting career. Cherie's father, the actor Tony Booth, also gave Tom some acting lessons. \"As a thank-you for organising the move into No 10 after the election they paid for all of us to have first-class flights to Cannes and stay a week at Geoffrey Robinson's apartment,\" Mrs Mark said. \"Cherie would lend me expensive clothes and jewellery and we would go out to the ballet together. \"That's the kind of people they are and that is the type of story we wanted to put in the book.\"",

I do like that Tony Robinson programme, Timewatch or something, where there's a historical twist. I used to love watching him in Blackadder too, I have all the videos. Last thing I watched was probably the Brits awards, and I got a bit sucked in because I do love Davina McCall, I think she's tremendous, gutsy. Person I can't stand? Charlie Dimmock. Exploits her position, if you see what I mean.\" May Lionel: \"I feel terribly guilty when I'm watching television, like I should be actually doing something, like going for a swim or cooking. I do like a bit of Morse, or a bit of costume drama, but I'd rather have a good bottle while I'm cooking, Keith Floyd style, rather than drink in front of the gogglebox.\" Derek Peat: \"Oh, it's very fashionable to be an expert on television these days, keeps us lot in business. I can't stand that Jilly Goulden woman, I know she's helped us all out, and I think she is a good, popular critic, but I just find her personality annoying. I for one liked the job when people found me interesting at par ties, but now all you get is 'Jilly Goulden this and that', and now I'm not half as scintillating as telly. What I watch is very arbitrary. I like a bit of Emmerdale, because it's filmed near where I live, and I like a bit of the morning BBC television, because the news coverage is so good. I'll tell you what I used to love, One Man And His Dog. Marvellous, zen TV.\" Keith Jameson: \"Can't stand it, drives me mad. Actually, I'll tell you, I like that advert with the old man and the grandson, because my family say I'm like the old man. Werthingtons - Werthers Original, that's it. That's my sort of television, old man's channel, that's what I'd watch. Three hours of people building ships out of matchsticks, hahah. One person I dislike? Who's that camp fellow? Dale Winton. Need I say anything else?\"",

He tries to repair his rocket shaped box. He convinces himself that a pizza joint is a spaceport. His delusion is total. It's very funny. \"You're a TOY, idiot!\" his fellow plaything Woody screams at him, vainly.

      "bodyText": "The knives were being sharpened last night as Labour MPs launched an inquest into the fiasco which has turned Londoners against Tony Blair and virtually guaranteed that Ken Livingstone will be swept into office as London's first directly elected mayor. Margaret McDonagh, Labour's fearsome general secretary who masterminded the \"Stop Ken\" campaign, found herself first in the firing line when a London Labour MP launched an extraordinary public attack on her. Stephen Pound, MP for Ealing North, called on Ms McDonagh to explain why she failed to heed \"loud and clear\" signals about the depth of support for a Livingstone campaign. \"When the dust has settled and the blood has soaked into the carpet and the bodies have been dragged away for burial, there will be a postmortem as there hasn't been in London Labour politics this side of the war,\" Mr Pound said. His outburst was echoed privately - in milder terms - by Blairite loyalists who criticised Ms McDonagh for making a catastrophic miscalculation in believing that Mr Livingstone would \"bottle out\" of an independent campaign. Ms McDonagh plumped for the complex electoral college on the correct assumption that it would block Mr Livingstone, without apparently appreciating that such a discredited system would only serve to boost his independent campaign. \"We all thought he would bottle it,\" a senior London Labour figure said. \"This is not a battle we thought we would have to fight.\" In a sign of the renewed Labour in-fighting, Ms McDonagh's supporters sprang to her defence last night. Fraser Kemp, a former Labour election campaign co-ordinator, said: \"For people now to come out with the suprising revelation that Ken Livingstone is popular in London and Margaret McDonagh kept it from them is ridiculous. She warned them every step of the way.\" Ms McDonagh's defenders believe she should be given credit for avoiding the worst case scenario: a Livingstone victory in the selection contest which would have seen him stand as Labour's official candidate. Tony Blair, who believes that the likes of Mr Livingstone were responsible for keeping Labour out of power for nearly a generation, was determined to block him. Despite the apparent cross-party love for the former Greater London council leader, the prime minister was adamant that a Livingstone mayoralty in Labour colours would alarm middle England voters in the run-up to a general election. Ms McDonagh argued correctly that the electoral college, which ensured that the votes of a Labour MP were worth the votes of 1,000 ordinary party members, was the only way of beating Mr Livingstone if he were allowed to stand. When the party's London selection panel allowed his name to go forward last November Ms McDonagh argued - once again correctly - that the election should be strung out to allow Mr Dobson to build up momentum. One Labour source said that Millbank faced huge difficulties whichever way it turned. \"Nobody could have presented us with a solution to this situation when we were up against a figure like Ken Livingstone,\" the source said. \"But we should not lose sight of one crucial fact: Ken Livingstone is not the official Labour candidate.\" In Westminster's feverish atmospehere, questions were even being asked last night about Mr Blair's judgment in dreaming up an elected mayor without thinking of a suitable candidate. One impeccable Blairite said that Downing Street should also accept its share of the blame for failing to focus on the Livingstone threat until the late autumn, by which time Mr Livingstone had built up a huge momentum. \"If there was a mistake it was that people did not focus on this early enough, mainly because of Northern Ireland,\" the Blair loyalist said.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone yesterday warned his supporters that the London mayoral race would end up being a tight fight between himself and the Labour and Tory party machines, despite his runaway lead in the Guardian/ICM opinion poll, published yesterday. On his first full day campaigning as an independent, the former Greater London council leader tried to wind down expectations aroused by his 55-point lead over the official Labour candidate Frank Dobson, as Labour's spokesman declared: \"Frank is the underdog now\". \"My expectation is that between Steve Norris, the Tory candidate, Frank Dobson and myself there is going to be very little in it on polling day and every vote is going to count,\" said the newly-suspended Labour MP for Brent East. \"I am certain as the campaign rolls on, it is actually going to be a very tight fight. There is no way to go but down.\" Mr Livingstone also went out of his way to emphasise his Labour credentials and support for the re-election of Tony Blair's government, despite the prime minister's prediction that he would be a disaster for London. \"This isn't some fundamental schism,\" he insisted. Appealing to his supporters to cast their potentially crucial second preference votes on May 4 for Mr Dobson, who has pointedly refused to say who he wants his own voters to transfer to, Mr Livingstone said he hoped one day to be back in the Labour party. \"I am not setting up another rival party, I am just giving Londoners the right to choose who they want as mayor,\" he said. The Labour hierarchy meanwhile sought to turn the tables on its tormentor by proclaiming Mr Dobson as the underdog, now that he is trailing Mr Livingstone by 55 points. \"Ken cannot have it both ways,\" a spokesman said, deriding the idea that he had \"only three men and a goat helping him\". Mr Livingstone appealed for Londoners to donate the \u00a3500,000 he says he needs to run a \"people's campaign\". Bobbie Law, an official of the London region of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said it intended to campaign and raise funds for his campaign. As cabinet office minister Ian McCartney branded Mr Livingstone \"the David Owen of the hard left\", and Mr Blair's spokesman called him \"poor little unspun Ken\", the former GLC leader was mobbed and cheered by students when he arrived for a lunchtime hustings at the London School of Economics. Mr Dobson, by contrast, was initially greeted with laughter as he began to address the hundreds of students packed into a lecture hall, telling them that his rival had failed to win the Labour nomination because he had been opposed by MPs - \"the people who knew him best trusted him least\". Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrat candidate, who yesterday announced her running mate as Baroness Hamwee, a local government stalwart, said she believed the faultline \"tearing Labour in two\" could mark a sea-change in British politics, signalling an end to traditional broad church \"umbrella parties\". But while she accused Mr Dobson and Mr Livingstone of turning the mayoral contest into a \"laughing stock\" and pleaded for an end to \"celebrity and personalities\", Mr Livingstone won enthusiastic applause when he told the students: \"You, the voters, should decide who represents you, not party bureaucrats or rigged electoral colleges\". He went on to attack London businesses for failing to do more for the city's ethnic minorities. Labour's spokesman countered: \"There is no doubt this man is anti-business.\"",

[AP, Mostar] Porn doesn't pay A Frenchman who dozed off while watching a porn film in a sex shop on Saturday had to be rescued by police, the daily Lib\u00e9ration reported. The 25-year-old called police after he woke during the night to find the shop, in Reims, north-east France, was locked and the owner had gone for the weekend. [Reuters, Paris]",

Under a new bill drawn up by the science and technology agency, researchers who attempt to produce clones of human beings will be subject to a fine or imprisonment. \"Human cloning may pose a threat to the maintenance of social order, the foundation of which is the family,\" Kimihiko Oda, an agency spokesman, said. The bill, which is expected to be submitted to parliament by the end of the month, reflects rising concern in Japan about cloning in the wake of the birth of Dolly the sheep, produced at the Roslin Institute in Scotland. If passed, the law would ban the implanting of cloned human embryos in the uterus of a woman or animal. Cloned embryos are formed by transplanting the nucleus of a human cell into an ovum whose nucleus has been removed. It would also ban the transplantation of chimera embryos, which are created by mixing human and animal cells, and hybrid embyros, which are formed by artificially fertilising an animal's ovum with human sperm. In addition, the bill would tighten regulations on other cloning techniques, such as dividing fertilised eggs. The agency said it would not close the door on all cloning research, but would monitor the field closely. Academics wanting to produce, transfer or import cloned embryos for research purposes would have to notify the science ministry. According to Japanese media reports, the government is considering a maximum sentence of between three and seven years. The measures, which would be among the most stringent in the world, are unusual in Japan, where non-binding administrative guidelines and self-regulation have been used to control the development of life science research. The new stance follows a public outcry over the loopholes in the existing system of regulation. Many Japanese were shocked in December 1998, when American scientist Richard Seed announced that he had secured funds and sites to begin human cloning research in Japan. Last November, researchers at Tokyo's university of agriculture were lambasted in the media for using cloning techniques to create human embryo stem cells. Doctors have resisted tighter regulation, which they say would hinder research into therapeutic cloning, which aims to develop remedies for cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. But the proposed move would bring Japan in line with European countries, including Britain, where the cloning of human embryos is banned for reproduction and research. Japan remains a leader in cloning technology, particularly in the artificial reproduction of cattle. The technology is expected to produce herds of cloned cows soon. The new bill effectively halts advances into human cloning, but this may prove to be temporary since the panel which proposed it has recommended that the legislation be reviewed after three to five years to take into account shifts in public opinion and scientific developments. For the moment, however, the government's advisers are unequivocal. \"Neither economic nor research benefits are to be gained from cloning human beings,\" said Yoshio Okada, the head of the panel.",

Sometimes it is \"Dobbo\", a nickname with amiable overtones. But it is almost never \"Frank\", though the official Labour candidate's first name has fewer letters than his surname, a factor which ought to help in the space-constrained art of headline-writing.</p> <p>In their domestic setting, as parents or a couple, the Blairs sometimes get the friendly treatment as Tony and Cherie. But yesterday's Daily Mirror - which is anti-Livingstone - sported a splash headline which declared: \"Nightmare: Blair faces civil war as Ken splits Labour.\"</p> <p>There it goes again. Ken and Blair, not Ken and Tony. Thus the Independent's splash headline yesterday struck a slightly false note for well-intentioned reasons. A triple-banner proclaimed: \"Ken says: 'I'll let London decide.' Frank says: 'The ego has landed.' Tony says: 'He would be a disaster.' \"</p> <p>But Tony, when used in both headlines and conversation, is often used ironically, for instance to mock the vicar's touchy-feely style in Private Eye's St Albion's Parish News. It is the same with \"Mandy\" Mandelson, the diminutive is ambiguous in the extreme, implicitly homophobic in the wrong hands.</p> <p>\"Paddy\" (as in Ashdown) might also have been pejorative if anyone regarded the MP for Yeovil as a real Irishman. But Ken is Ken even to Blair and those Westminster colleagues who loathe him - quite a lot of them, actually - and do not see him as a latterday Charlie Chaplin, the lovable cockney underdog, Labour's irrepressible cheeky chappie.</p> <p>They see him as an unprincipled opportunist, a loner and a liar, an egotist, not really a party man. There is truth in many of the accusations. But there is little evidence so far that they will do him much harm. Ken is a brilliantly-marketed brand, which means different things to different people, from newt-fancier to Blair-baiter.</p> <p>Advertising agencies would pay - do pay - a fortune to gain such name recognition for their clients. How often do we observe this phenomenon in politics and why? Not often. In recent times there was \"Maggie\" Thatcher, a cheeky diminutive which did not sit easily with the Iron Lady's daunting public personality.</p> <p>Her friends called her Margaret. Indeed old-school Tories tend to frown on vulgar diminutives among their leaders. Chris Patten's use of \"Chris\" was a black mark against him. Anthony Blair (as he styled himself during the 1982 Beaconsfield byelection) became something of a class traitor when he became plain Tony.</p> <p>The Rt Hon Anthony Wedgwood Benn's demotic crime was even greater after he not only refused to become Lord Stansgate, but rebranded himself in Who's Who as plain Tony Benn. Yet, even in the heyday of his fame and influence, he was rarely spoken about as \"Tony\" without self-conscious intent, friendly or foul.</p> <p>In the same era, Sir Edward Heath's friends call him \"Ted\" ,but not voters or editorial writers. William Hague's colleagues self-consciously refer to him during TV interviews as \"William\" - not Mr Hague - but the trick does not work. As the Australian expression goes: \"If his name was William you wouldn't call him Bill.\"</p> <p>Maggie was an attempt to humanise the prime minister of the day. With Ken Livingstone it is different, he is human already and people like him for it. He has \"pintability\" - the sort of bloke you'd happily have a pint with.</p> <p>Coincidentally Ken Clarke - who calls him Kenneth? - has many of the same qualities, though the Labour MP for Brent East is clearly the senior Ken in the public mind. We see Ken in a headline and know which one we mean. There may be a deeper reason for that. Clarke is a serious political heavyweight who cultivates a bloke-ish, populist style.</p> <p>Voters enjoy it, but they are not deceived. The ex-chancellor may boast that he has not read the Maastricht Treaty, and he really does like pints and cigars. But he is not really like most of us. Ken really is a populist who expresses better than most people the gut instincts and prejudices of a significant section of voters.</p> <p>There have always been politicians who can do this sort of business, but not very many. They do not even have to be populists, though they do have to be able to communicate their thoughts, lofty or low, in terms which the rest of us can understand and, preferably, be moved by. Gladstone was \"the People's William\", Churchill sometimes Winston or even Winnie.</p> <p>Thus when he returned to be first lord of the admiralty when war broke out in September 1939 a simple message was signalled throughout the Royal Navy: \"Winston is back.\" He had held the same job in 1914. It helps, of course, to have a distinctive name. Winston, Enoch, Harold . . .</p> <p>Harold Wilson was probably the last Labour politician to evoke such feelings of affection among ordinary voters. They felt that, despite being prime minister and being so clever, he remained one of them. Wilson played on it, no brandy and cigars in public, he drank pints on camera.</p> <p>Changing standards of public decorum have a bearing on all this. Nye Bevan passed muster as a much-loved (and loathed) orator, democratic socialism's great romantic hero, and a funny name too. People spoke of \"Nye and Jenny\" - Jenny Lee MP, his formidable wife - but not in a Kennish way. He was Bevan or Mr Bevan. Harold MacMillan was Supermac.</p> <p>It is a sign of the times that the Tory candidate for London mayor can be referred to in print and on the air as Shagger. No one ever said that about Lloyd George who won an Archer-ish libel case merely because his wife turned up in court. She didn't even have to give fragrant evidence.</p> <p>That was before women had the vote, let alone exercised political power. Is it a coincidence that two prominent women in Anglo-Saxon political culture pass the Ken test? Dr Marjorie Mowlam is famously voter-friendly and has been rewarded with the fetching soubriquet Mo.</p> <p>No wonder that Downing St has intermittently eyed her up as a Dobson-substitute. Across the pond the former Hillary Rodham Clinton first dropped the Rodham, now she has dropped the Clinton as she courts New York voters. Is it a populist move or top-down marketing? We shall find out in November. But Hillary still has a long way to go to catch up the cheeky chappie. His brand name is all over London, South Ken, Kennington, Kenwood, Kentish Town . . .</p>",

Note that \"Dobson\". Sometimes it is \"Dobbo\", a nickname with amiable overtones. But it is almost never \"Frank\", though the official Labour candidate's first name has fewer letters than his surname, a factor which ought to help in the space-constrained art of headline-writing. In their domestic setting, as parents or a couple, the Blairs sometimes get the friendly treatment as Tony and Cherie. But yesterday's Daily Mirror - which is anti-Livingstone - sported a splash headline which declared: \"Nightmare: Blair faces civil war as Ken splits Labour.\" There it goes again. Ken and Blair, not Ken and Tony. Thus the Independent's splash headline yesterday struck a slightly false note for well-intentioned reasons. A triple-banner proclaimed: \"Ken says: 'I'll let London decide.' Frank says: 'The ego has landed.' Tony says: 'He would be a disaster.' \" But Tony, when used in both headlines and conversation, is often used ironically, for instance to mock the vicar's touchy-feely style in Private Eye's St Albion's Parish News. It is the same with \"Mandy\" Mandelson, the diminutive is ambiguous in the extreme, implicitly homophobic in the wrong hands. \"Paddy\" (as in Ashdown) might also have been pejorative if anyone regarded the MP for Yeovil as a real Irishman. But Ken is Ken even to Blair and those Westminster colleagues who loathe him - quite a lot of them, actually - and do not see him as a latterday Charlie Chaplin, the lovable cockney underdog, Labour's irrepressible cheeky chappie. They see him as an unprincipled opportunist, a loner and a liar, an egotist, not really a party man. There is truth in many of the accusations. But there is little evidence so far that they will do him much harm. Ken is a brilliantly-marketed brand, which means different things to different people, from newt-fancier to Blair-baiter. Advertising agencies would pay - do pay - a fortune to gain such name recognition for their clients. How often do we observe this phenomenon in politics and why? Not often. In recent times there was \"Maggie\" Thatcher, a cheeky diminutive which did not sit easily with the Iron Lady's daunting public personality. Her friends called her Margaret. Indeed old-school Tories tend to frown on vulgar diminutives among their leaders. Chris Patten's use of \"Chris\" was a black mark against him. Anthony Blair (as he styled himself during the 1982 Beaconsfield byelection) became something of a class traitor when he became plain Tony. The Rt Hon Anthony Wedgwood Benn's demotic crime was even greater after he not only refused to become Lord Stansgate, but rebranded himself in Who's Who as plain Tony Benn. Yet, even in the heyday of his fame and influence, he was rarely spoken about as \"Tony\" without self-conscious intent, friendly or foul. In the same era, Sir Edward Heath's friends call him \"Ted\" ,but not voters or editorial writers. William Hague's colleagues self-consciously refer to him during TV interviews as \"William\" - not Mr Hague - but the trick does not work. As the Australian expression goes: \"If his name was William you wouldn't call him Bill.\" Maggie was an attempt to humanise the prime minister of the day. With Ken Livingstone it is different, he is human already and people like him for it. He has \"pintability\" - the sort of bloke you'd happily have a pint with. Coincidentally Ken Clarke - who calls him Kenneth? - has many of the same qualities, though the Labour MP for Brent East is clearly the senior Ken in the public mind. We see Ken in a headline and know which one we mean. There may be a deeper reason for that. Clarke is a serious political heavyweight who cultivates a bloke-ish, populist style. Voters enjoy it, but they are not deceived. The ex-chancellor may boast that he has not read the Maastricht Treaty, and he really does like pints and cigars. But he is not really like most of us. Ken really is a populist who expresses better than most people the gut instincts and prejudices of a significant section of voters. There have always been politicians who can do this sort of business, but not very many. They do not even have to be populists, though they do have to be able to communicate their thoughts, lofty or low, in terms which the rest of us can understand and, preferably, be moved by. Gladstone was \"the People's William\", Churchill sometimes Winston or even Winnie. Thus when he returned to be first lord of the admiralty when war broke out in September 1939 a simple message was signalled throughout the Royal Navy: \"Winston is back.\" He had held the same job in 1914. It helps, of course, to have a distinctive name. Winston, Enoch, Harold . . . Harold Wilson was probably the last Labour politician to evoke such feelings of affection among ordinary voters. They felt that, despite being prime minister and being so clever, he remained one of them. Wilson played on it, no brandy and cigars in public, he drank pints on camera. Changing standards of public decorum have a bearing on all this. Nye Bevan passed muster as a much-loved (and loathed) orator, democratic socialism's great romantic hero, and a funny name too. People spoke of \"Nye and Jenny\" - Jenny Lee MP, his formidable wife - but not in a Kennish way. He was Bevan or Mr Bevan. Harold MacMillan was Supermac. It is a sign of the times that the Tory candidate for London mayor can be referred to in print and on the air as Shagger. No one ever said that about Lloyd George who won an Archer-ish libel case merely because his wife turned up in court. She didn't even have to give fragrant evidence. That was before women had the vote, let alone exercised political power. Is it a coincidence that two prominent women in Anglo-Saxon political culture pass the Ken test? Dr Marjorie Mowlam is famously voter-friendly and has been rewarded with the fetching soubriquet Mo. No wonder that Downing St has intermittently eyed her up as a Dobson-substitute. Across the pond the former Hillary Rodham Clinton first dropped the Rodham, now she has dropped the Clinton as she courts New York voters. Is it a populist move or top-down marketing? We shall find out in November. But Hillary still has a long way to go to catch up the cheeky chappie. His brand name is all over London, South Ken, Kennington, Kenwood, Kentish Town . . .",

      "body": "<p>Hamish Campbell remembers the moment that became the turning point in his life with great clarity, allowing himself one of those little chuckles which suggests both pleasure and pain. It was lunchtime. He was sitting in his office on the second floor of the murder squad's headquarters in Kensington, west London, when the fingerprint officer poked his head round the corner to say that a woman had been stabbed in Fulham.</p> <p>Within minutes, Campbell was in a car speeding towards the scene, believing that he was heading for a serious, but probably routine crime. \"On the way, I heard that the woman was Jill Dando,\" he says. \"I was shocked like everyone else. I told the driver to get there as quickly as possible.\"</p> <p>Reminders of the gruesome sight awaiting him in Gowan Avenue that bright afternoon last April transfix any visitor to his cramped but tidy room that overlooks Earls Court Road. Close-up photographs of the blood-smeared doorstep taken shortly after what proved to be a shooting are pinned on a noticeboard. He offers to take them down, then disappears to make a cup of tea.</p> <p>Next month will see the first anniversary of Dando's murder and Campbell, the detective chief inspector in charge of the inquiry, is painfully aware that the pressure on him and the rest of the 45-strong murder squad in the build-up will be excruciating. They are bracing themselves for inevitable public frustration and, possibly, derision that nobody has yet been caught.</p> <p>Campbell is prepared. He is rare among senior police officers. He is good at handling the media, but he does not enjoy the spotlight. This interview, the first he has given in nearly 11 months, is an opportunity to set the record straight before the frenzy starts again.</p> <p>\"He will be caught. Don't ask me when. It could be this month, it could be next month. If it is an ex-lover somewhere from her past who has arranged for this to happen, someone will eventually break the silence. If it is a loner, it will come out eventually. I'm a great believer. I really am.\" He does not deny that he feels the self-same \"puzzlement and perplexion\" that he felt the day she was shot. But he insists good progress is being made.</p> <p>Finding Dando's killer has become his obsession. Campbell has not taken on any other cases since April 26 and his team of detectives and civilians has been ringfenced so they can concentrate on what has become the biggest murder investigation the country has seen since the hunt to capture the Yorkshire Ripper a quarter of a century ago.</p> <p>The man in charge of that inquiry, assistant chief constable George Oldfield, pursued that case with a zeal that eventually destroyed his career and his personal life. He saw it as a straight fight between him and culprit. He was shifted from his post before Sutcliffe was caught and died a broken man in 1985.</p> <p>Campbell laughs at the suggestion that the Dando hunt might one day take a similar toll: \"That will not be me, I can assure you.\"</p> <p>Colleagues say that, by nature, Campbell is a patient man. He needs to be. So far, the 13-hour days (he's in at 8am), the expectation of \"getting a result\" and the frustrations of not appearing to make a substantial headway do not seem to have affected his spirits. In many ways, his lugubrious style suits this pace of investigation. Before Dando, he was in charge of two baffling cases, the disappearance of the Argentinian Gracia Morton in Kensington in November 1997 and the murder of the Macedonian schoolgirl Katrina Koneva in Hammersmith in May 1997.</p> <p>At the Dando squad's headquarters, an anonymous building next to Kensington police station, his team seems busy rather than frantic. Campbell is surrounded by files with more than 1,000 statements, the names of potential suspects and endless computer-generated flowcharts linking what evidence they have. He waves some of them, shakes his head and says: \"Before the end of the second day of the investigation I knew it was not going to be solved easily. I wrote it in my notes and I remember telling the team that this has all the hallmarks of being a long inquiry. It can be difficult and obviously there is tiredness, but I am not despondent.\"</p> <p>He says he needs to be positive to keep spirits up. \"That's part of leadership. If the others saw me and said 'Have you seen the boss today, he is totally depressed about it', that would filter down. This is hard but not impossible. It's not beyond the wherewithal of this organisation with all the resources we have. Everyone must see a light at the end of the tunnel.\"</p> <p>He treats the murder as a puzzle rather than a personal crusade. \"I like logic, and this is a logical process. What we are trying to do is link the victim to the crime scene to the suspect.\" He prefers, he says, to cajole and encourage rather than to shout and scream. \"I have never been like that. It serves no purpose. I need a team that is going to speak to each other. They need to be clear headed because they will be the ones who will knock on the door and see the killer, not me.\"</p> <p>The frustrations, though, have been barely tolerable. Campbell has gathered a mass of information which still cannot be distilled into pertinent intelligence about what happened last year. Although Dando, 37, was killed in broad daylight, there were no witnesses. Apart from the bullet, which was \"crimped\" into a cartridge in a very distinctive way, there was no forensic evidence. Worst of all, from a detective's point of view, there was and remains no obvious motive. The squad has also not had any luck.</p> <p>To some, it may seem that the inquiry is no further forward. The highs have often been followed by lows, requiring Campbell to use his weekly meetings to reassure his team that they still have much work to do and are heading in the right direction.</p> <p>He gives two examples. Scotland Yard appealed for help to track down someone who had accessed an internet service, 192.com, to pinpoint exactly where Ms Dando lived. The discovery that someone (possibly a stalker) had used the site was a breakthrough, and the fact they managed to trace the person was a triumph. Yet the man, who lives in Wales, was quickly ruled out as a suspect. \"Finding him was a tremendous piece of detective work. He was totally oblivious to the appeals we had made. He told us he hadn't been watching the TV at the time. We get caught up in the trauma and the storm, and sometimes forget that other people are concentrating on their own priorities.\"</p> <p>It was a similar story with the mysterious blond-haired gas meter reader spotted near Dando's house. When he was eventually traced he said he hadn't bothered to get in touch because he had nothing to tell them. Theories are another source of irritation. He gets them wherever he goes and tries to deal with them with \"quiet respect\".</p> <p>Only his opinion is truly important, and he has been reluctant to share his thoughts - until now. The inquiry has two central strands; Dando was killed by a crazed stalker or by a contract killer, possibly working with a team. Campbell has never been drawn on the subject before, but he says his \"gut feeling\" is that she was killed by loner.</p> <p>\"My instinct was that it was an individual rather than a group. The lack of criminal intelligence, the confusion at the scene and the mess over the firearm . . . and there's something not quite right about the bullet.</p> <p>\"If a criminal gang, let's say of three, were at work in Gowan Avenue, then there'd be three times as many people behind the scenes who would know about it. Yet we've heard nothing from the underworld. We haven't had one call. Not one. Detectives across London have spoken to all of their informants, and heard nothing. Someone from that group would have come forward to claim the \u00a3250,000 reward, and they haven't. Did every single informant just dry up on April 26?\"</p> <p>His officers have been to see major criminals to sound them out about underworld figures who might have been tempted to put out a contract, possibly because Dando presented Crimewatch.</p> <p>\"The lads who have gone to prison and spoken to these people have been laughed at. The major criminals all say the same thing: 'Why would we want to do that?' She was a newscaster who did holiday programmes. So why her? Why not Roger Cook or Shaw Taylor [who used to present the ITV programme, Police Five]. On that basis, Shaw Taylor would have been killed 100 times over. Criminals were upset if they didn't get a mention on his show.\"</p> <p>Campbell stresses that the loner theory does not preclude the idea that she was killed by a contract killer, and that the investigation has not lurched in a different direction. But he adds: \"In most contract killings, the victim is a criminal. Dando was not a criminal. She was as much involved in crime as you or I.\"</p> <p>Campbell loses his temper once, when he recalls how the police have not been able to trace several men who were in Gowan Avenue in the hours before she was shot. \"There were 23 sightings yet none of these men have contacted us. Why not? As I sit here in the middle of this storm, I think that is pretty extraordinary.\" When he is animated he has a tendency to look over his shoulder out of the window. \"I have appealed again and again for the men in that blooming road to come forward! It would make our job so much simpler. I cannot believe that some of those people don't know who they are. Have they been on another part of the planet? There's little point being frustrated, but I find it really disappointing.\"</p> <p>Campbell has told his detectives to ignore the stories that have appeared in the press over the past year. \"They never cease to amaze. The one about her being shot by a Russian [mafia boss] came out of thin air. Once they are out there, some of them seem to take on a life force of their own.\"</p> <p>In the weeks up to next month's anniversary, he will ask the public to forget them, too, and concentrate on three important areas. He wants to hear about people who have had \"an unhealthy interest in Jill Dando\". \"Not people who had a passing interest or balanced admirers. If someone is harbouring doubts about an individual, I would like to know.\"</p> <p>He pleads again for the men in Gowan Avenue to ring him, if only so they can be eliminated as suspects, and for information which will solve the mystery of the cartridge, which was crimped with six unusual indentations. The evidence presented to him so far has been neither \"convincing or compelling\", but Campbell says he remains optimistic.</p> <p>\"We can find the person responsible.

      "bodyText": "An attempt by British American Tobacco to improve deteriorating relations with the government over a cigarette smuggling epidemic appears to be going up in smoke the company admitted yesterday. The world's second largest cigarette manufacturer wrote to ministers a month ago in an attempt to create a more constructive dialogue, but has not heard back. BAT's chairman, Martin Broughton, described Tony Blair's administration as confrontational, admitting that \"relations with government have not been good since it came into power\". BAT is angry about the tax differential on tobacco between Britain and continental Europe which has led to black-market cigarettes taking a claimed 25% market share. But BAT's own position has been under fire after revelations in the Guardian that the company itself had exploited smuggling. Yesterday BAT, which owns the Rothmans, Lucky Strike and State Express 555 brands, produced an 86% increase in pre-tax profits at \u00a31.36bn. Mr Broughton said there was no way of knowing how much 1999 figures were affected by black market sales. BAT's financial position has been dramatically improved by the \u00a313bn merger with Rothmans earlier last year which brought it closer to competing for pole position with Marlboro maker Philip Morris. Merger integration has developed faster than expected and BAT is in line to exceed targets of shaving \u00a3250m a year off operating costs. But this was achieved through taking a \u00a3357m charge in 1999 meaning the planned \u00a3400m charge anticipated over three years will be exceeded. The group said its volumes rose 5% to 735bn cigarettes but without the merger, sales were down 9%, in line with international competitors. The company's shares, which have underperformed the FTSE all share index by 20% over the last 12 months fell to end the day down 13p at 261p.",

The electricity industry demanded urgent talks with Mr Byers in order to \"clarify and simplify\" the bill and remove the arbitrary powers given to the secretary of state and the industry regulator, Ofgem. The move by the Electricity Association coincided with the bill's return to a commons standing committee where it is to be shorn of its telecoms and water provisions after last week's reversal by Mr Byers. Industry insiders said the thrust of the neutered bill contradicted the competition act - which came into effect on March 1 and allows fines of up to 10% of sales for uncompetitive behaviour - by proposing unlimited penalties. The utilities bill, which focuses on consumers, is meant to complement the competition act. Mr Byers is already under siege for his mishandling of the \"rip-off Britain\" campaign and failure to influence the cabinet debate over raising the minimum wage. Last week he was forced by interventions from Tony Blair and John Prescott to remove telecoms and water from the scope of the utilities bill. But the Electricity Association said the changes, seen as reducing the putative com mon regulatory framework for utilities to a shell dealing with energy, still left too many generic provisions. The bill still gave Mr Byers and Ofgem \"open ended\" powers which could cause uncertainty and lead to higher costs to business and consumers. If a customer were disconnected and a firm failed to reconnect him or her within 24 hours, for instance, the consumer could be awarded compensation and take legal action while Ofgem could levy a substantial fine - \"triple jeopardy\", according to insiders. DTI officials said some of these powers would be limited to two years and the proposed penalties would be \"appropriate and proportionate\".

New agreements with wine, spirits and bar snacks suppliers are expected to save \u00a33m. Not that the pace of new openings is slowing. Mr Martin now has 370 pubs and plans 185 more in the next two years. He reckons there is room for 1,500, is planning his first foray into Northern Ireland and not ruling out a move to the Republic either. City analysts like what they see. Williams de Broe changed its recommendation from hold to buy, while house broker WestLB Panmure rates it outperform with a 425p target. Deutsche Bank also reckons they are a buy, with a 482p target.",

      "body": "<p>The Adelaide festival is like Edinburgh on heat: 39 celsius on one baking day last week. Superficially, there are resemblances between Adelaide in March and Auld Reekie in August. Both offer a three-week cultural binge in cities of extraordinary beauty. Both have a bustling fringe: in Adelaide, 530 events in 100 venues. Both have accompanying conferences and writers' weeks: this year, Adelaide blends native talents including Tom Keneally and former prime minister Paul Keating with overseas visitors such as Vikram Seth, Richard Ford and Hilary Mantel. </p> <p>But it is the differences between Adelaide and Edinburgh that really strike me. In Adelaide there is far more stress on innovation, experiment and outreach. Under the direction of singer Robyn Archer, this year's festival offers a wealth of new work; the guess is that her successor in 2002, the American director Peter Sellars, will take the process further. On the evidence of the first few days, I would say that the eye has dominated the ear: I have had any number of visually astonishing experiences. </p> <p>Adelaide's major museums and galleries are an integral part of the festival, something woefully untrue in Edinburgh. Without doubt the big event so far has been the opening of a new Australian aboriginal cultures gallery in the local museum, a stunning revelation using archival film, videos and computerised graphics. Next door in the Art Gallery of South Australia there is an equally overwhelming temporary exhibition, Beyond the Pale, celebrating the work of modern indigenous urban artists. Vibrant, colourful, often rudely satirical - the current Australian PM, John Howard, is seen raping the land - the exhibition would grace any gallery in the world. Caroline Baum, an ABC radio producer, neatly summed up the significance of both exhibitions: for the first time in Australia, she said, the aboriginals are being seen not as historic victims but as exuberantly original artists. </p> <p>Australia's complex attitude to its past has dominated every discussion I have had in a week in Sydney. But, in festival terms, it is the power of the image that has constantly hit me. That was certainly true of the big opening night event: the Netherlands Opera production of Writing to Vermeer, with music by Louis Andriessen and libretto by Peter Greenaway, previously seen in Amsterdam. The production, by Saskia Boddeke and Greenaway himself, is a visual feast: the eye is constantly ravished by Vermeer images, video footage and, at the end, cascading water as the Dutch open the dykes to repel the invading French in 1672. My feeling is that the assertive production overwhelms Andriessen's music and even the libretto, dealing with the letters written by Vermeer's wife, mother-in-law and model while he was away in the Hague. This is opera as entrancingly liquid spectacle rather than experience driven by music and character. </p> <p>The interaction of film and theatre, which we have only tentatively explored in Britain, is taken even further in a work by the Melbourne-based Arena theatre company, ominously entitled Eat Your Young. This 80-minute show posits a future world in which delinquent children in care are controlled by means of neural implants and offered simulated reality as a reward for good behaviour. The script smacks of B-feature schlock but the production, devised by Rosemary Myers, is brilliantly sophisticated in its integration of live action and automated images. As giant robotic screens circle the three young actors you feel that the troubled boss of the institution - played by the rotund Merfyn Owen - is invading their imagination. I recently saw Britain's Station House Opera offer a similar mixture of live action and film, but at home we have a long way to go in exploring the theatrical potential of mixed media. </p> <p> If the eye has so far dominated in Adelaide, the word fought back strenuously with Howard Barker's eight-hour epic, The Ecstatic Bible, jointly staged by the Wrestling School and Adelaide's Brink Productions. As so often with Barker's work, I was left in several minds. The play offers an excavation of western culture, with references not just to the Bible but to Euripides, Shakespeare, the Shaw of Back to Methuselah, Brecht, Bond and Beckett; Barker himself describes it as \"an archaeological dig\". I was also reminded of Janacek's opera, The Makropoulos Affair, in that Barker's heroine is a kind of eternal woman who lives on into her second century and even goes on bearing children: in her boundless fertility, she seems fecund to none. </p> <p>Barker's epic vision of the chaos of human experience, in which desire and creativity are seen against a background of war and destruction, has some powerful scenes and much leavening humour: I was particularly taken with a harassed poet whose dream of happiness is \"to sit in a cafe laughing with other poets, some of whom are less talented than me\". My problem with Barker's own poetic allegory is that it is not grounded in social reality. His leading characters - the fertile heroine and a vagrant priest, excellently played by Victoria Wicks and Gerrard McArthur - journey through a war-ravaged landscape that could be almost anywhere at any time. But myths, as CS Lewis always insisted, need to be anchored in observable truth; Barker puts the allegorical cart before the narrative horse. </p> <p>One has, however, to admire his dauntless ambition. The production, directed by Barker and Tim Maddock and designed by Mary Moore, was also a remarkable joint venture between two companies from different continents. And, in a festival dominated so far by ocular experiences, Barker reasserted the power of muscular theatrical language. But eight hours is a long time in theatre and I have to confess there were moments when my own dream of happiness became to sit in one of Adelaide's numerous cafes laughing with other critics.</p>",

How would you feel? Relieved, wary, insulted? Sixty \"trailblazer\" Sure Start teams are about to find out, as the government's \u00a3542m early years programme gets off the drawing board and into targeted families' front rooms this month. </p> <p>All parents of under-fours in selected catchment areas are being offered a Sure Start visit. The aim is to help these families - many of them lone parents - head off potential child-rearing problems. This can cover anything from how to get your screaming baby to sleep, to finding a playgroup, taming a hyperactive toddler or coping with your own confused feelings. </p> <p>In Hastings, one of the earliest schemes to get up and running, Sure Start coordinator Jan Casson is confident they can negotiate the tricky business of offering parents support without patronising or stigmatising them. \"Our programme is based on Playlink, a home visiting scheme we've been running for several years,\" she says. \"They call us the 'bag ladies' round here, because we arrive with a big bag of toys and a playmat, and basically get down on the floor for an hour and help mum play with the kids.\" </p> <p>Over 90% of families on the four housing estates that make up Ore Valley - \"the trailblazer catchment area\" - have taken up the offer of an initial visit. But it's been running on a wing and a prayer, with a long waiting list. </p> <p>Now a \u00a32.8m, three-year Sure Start grant means they can employ more visitors, build a community centre, and extend services, such as toy libraries, playbuses and drop-ins. </p> <p>Ore Valley, with a population of over 10,000, has one of the highest rates of unemployment, teenage pregnancy and poverty in the country, plus substantial drug and crime problems. But now, with all this extra money, there's a glimmer of hope - not just for the children, who will benefit from new one-stop health and social services, but for the parents too. A young parents' group, parenting classes and a range of NVQs will soon be on offer on their doorstep. </p> <p>Casson, a former nursery nurse, does not envisage much resistance from local families to an initial Sure Start visit, or too many fears about social worker types coming to take children away. \"After all, people are not being referred to us individually,\" she says. \"The whole district has been targeted. And where child protection issues do arise, we'll handle them sensitively. The entire emphasis is on family support.\" </p> <p>Certainly, the rationale behind Sure Start - \"the reason the trea sury is so firmly backing it,\" according to Casson - is its \"catch 'em early\" philosophy. By focusing on early years family support, with specific targets for birth weight, child development and those at risk, the government hopes to reduce expensive social problems in years to come. </p> <p>This month, 69 \"second wave\" bids go in and 250 schemes should be operational by April 2002. </p> <p>To work, though, Sure Start needs to be sustainable. Which means that, when the money runs out in a couple of years, these communities must be able to go it alone, maintaining the momentum for older children. </p> <p>At the other end of East Sussex, Jack Smith, social services lead officer for the Wealden Sure Start scheme, is convinced that the best way to do this is by relying on parents themselves. He says: \"We've been training up local people - not to be health visitors and such like, but to become 'community parents'. Many mothers and fathers object to professionals coming in and telling them how to parent their children. They feel it labels them as a problem. This way, we are drawing on the resources of local parents, who know first-hand what it's like to bring up children round here.\" </p> <p> Their catchment area is based on three housing estates in Hailsham East, a very poor ward with a 10% traveller community, very high levels of special needs, and around one-third of young mothers with post-natal depression. A \u00a32.3m from Sure Start and a \u00a32.8m grant from the single regeneration budget (SRB), means there will soon be a new community centre, offering a range of services to older as well as pre-school children. But to succeed, says Smith, the whole scheme must be firmly community-led. </p> <p>Naomi Eisenstadt, head of Sure Start, says: \"The programme is explicitly designed to avoid stigma, and a key principle is to involve local communities in provision from the outset.\" However she concedes that the extent to which this is happening in practice is patchy. </p> <p>A note of caution is also sounded by Walter Barker, head of the early childhood development at Bristol university. He was consulted early on by Sure Start civil servants looking for models to build on, and is helping some local schemes to develop a community parenting approach. \"It's not the quick fix that politicians are looking for,\" he warns. \"But it is a way to give poor families some control over their lives.\" </p> <p>Barker fears a token involvement in Sure Start - \"a meek and mild parent representative on the local board\" - while power remains firmly in the professionals' hands. </p> <p>It's a tough one to crack. But the path Sure Start takes - as a well-meaning benefactor or as a genuine empowerer of local communities - could well determine its success for generations to come.</p>",

In Hastings, one of the earliest schemes to get up and running, Sure Start coordinator Jan Casson is confident they can negotiate the tricky business of offering parents support without patronising or stigmatising them. \"Our programme is based on Playlink, a home visiting scheme we've been running for several years,\" she says. \"They call us the 'bag ladies' round here, because we arrive with a big bag of toys and a playmat, and basically get down on the floor for an hour and help mum play with the kids.\" Over 90% of families on the four housing estates that make up Ore Valley - \"the trailblazer catchment area\" - have taken up the offer of an initial visit. But it's been running on a wing and a prayer, with a long waiting list. Now a \u00a32.8m, three-year Sure Start grant means they can employ more visitors, build a community centre, and extend services, such as toy libraries, playbuses and drop-ins. Ore Valley, with a population of over 10,000, has one of the highest rates of unemployment, teenage pregnancy and poverty in the country, plus substantial drug and crime problems. But now, with all this extra money, there's a glimmer of hope - not just for the children, who will benefit from new one-stop health and social services, but for the parents too. A young parents' group, parenting classes and a range of NVQs will soon be on offer on their doorstep. Casson, a former nursery nurse, does not envisage much resistance from local families to an initial Sure Start visit, or too many fears about social worker types coming to take children away. \"After all, people are not being referred to us individually,\" she says. \"The whole district has been targeted. And where child protection issues do arise, we'll handle them sensitively. The entire emphasis is on family support.\" Certainly, the rationale behind Sure Start - \"the reason the trea sury is so firmly backing it,\" according to Casson - is its \"catch 'em early\" philosophy. By focusing on early years family support, with specific targets for birth weight, child development and those at risk, the government hopes to reduce expensive social problems in years to come. This month, 69 \"second wave\" bids go in and 250 schemes should be operational by April 2002. To work, though, Sure Start needs to be sustainable. Which means that, when the money runs out in a couple of years, these communities must be able to go it alone, maintaining the momentum for older children. At the other end of East Sussex, Jack Smith, social services lead officer for the Wealden Sure Start scheme, is convinced that the best way to do this is by relying on parents themselves. He says: \"We've been training up local people - not to be health visitors and such like, but to become 'community parents'. Many mothers and fathers object to professionals coming in and telling them how to parent their children. They feel it labels them as a problem. This way, we are drawing on the resources of local parents, who know first-hand what it's like to bring up children round here.\" Their catchment area is based on three housing estates in Hailsham East, a very poor ward with a 10% traveller community, very high levels of special needs, and around one-third of young mothers with post-natal depression. A \u00a32.3m from Sure Start and a \u00a32.8m grant from the single regeneration budget (SRB), means there will soon be a new community centre, offering a range of services to older as well as pre-school children. But to succeed, says Smith, the whole scheme must be firmly community-led. Naomi Eisenstadt, head of Sure Start, says: \"The programme is explicitly designed to avoid stigma, and a key principle is to involve local communities in provision from the outset.\" However she concedes that the extent to which this is happening in practice is patchy. A note of caution is also sounded by Walter Barker, head of the early childhood development at Bristol university. He was consulted early on by Sure Start civil servants looking for models to build on, and is helping some local schemes to develop a community parenting approach. \"It's not the quick fix that politicians are looking for,\" he warns. \"But it is a way to give poor families some control over their lives.\" Barker fears a token involvement in Sure Start - \"a meek and mild parent representative on the local board\" - while power remains firmly in the professionals' hands. It's a tough one to crack. But the path Sure Start takes - as a well-meaning benefactor or as a genuine empowerer of local communities - could well determine its success for generations to come.",

It was sadly touching to telephone him with birthday greetings a day after the untimely death of Chris Balderstone, a far younger footballing cricketer of the legend, who had followed Watson a generation later in cutting his sporting teeth both as a Huddersfield Town bootboy and at Headingley's indoor nets. </p> <p>Watson was shocked at the news. He moved to South Africa in 1968 to be administrator at Johannesburg's Wanderers club. Yesterday he was in Cape Town for a family celebration, surrounded by grandchildren. \"I'm hoping we finish in time to catch Man United in Bordeaux on the satellite,\" he said with a chuckle. \"That's all I'm good for now, a bit of DIY and all the satellite sport.\" </p> <p>The famous wavy hair is still there but the gold is a thinning grey now. All his sporting contemporaries liked Watson. Never a bad word. The only rider came from his hero, Len Hutton: \"Sport? It all came too easy for our Willie.\" </p> <p>Another birthday call, nearer home, is due this Friday, for only two members survive of that club open to those who played soccer and cricket for England: Watson and young Arthur Milton, who will be 72 on March 10. It will never enrol another. </p> <p>Watson won four soccer caps for England and was a member of the 1950 World Cup squad. He played 23 Tests. Look up any cuttings, they unfailingly call Watson a \"cultured\" wing-half and an \"elegant\" left-handed bat. </p> <p>\"How privileged I was to play with and against the best at close quarters: Len, technically the greatest bat ever; John Charles, the complete footballer; Len Shackleton, who had everything as an individual except being a link in the chain; and my old Sunderland wing-half buddy Arthur Wright, who had the lot except his due rewards for ball-playing brilliance.\" </p> <p> It was Tuesday June 30 1953 at Lord's which set Watson apart in the lore; from 11.30am to 5.51pm, to be exact. He had gone in the night before, at No5, with England at a perilous 12 for three against Australia, 332 behind with six and a bit hours to bat. </p> <p>Next morning Denis Compton was out for 33 at 12.40 and England were 73 for four. Trevor Bailey joined this same cheerful ancient who is now at the end of a phone-line 47 years later. \"Funny, isn't it? I can't remember five days ago but can vividly recall near 50 years. </p> <p>\"Denis never got credit for setting us on the road that day. He reined in his natural happy style and that rubbed off on me and Trevor. </p> <p>\"We still had to take the runs and by lunch we were on 116; 96 in the morning, damn good going, eh? An hour after lunch the new ball was due. That would decide it, everyone knew. As well as [Ray] Lindwall and [Keith] Miller, they had [Bill] Johnston and [Alan] Davidson, each ripe-cherry men all right. They took it dead on five to three. </p> <p>\"I can still feel the tension quadrupling out there in the middle and round the whole packed arena. The crowd kept increasing as word got round. Every delivery was of such importance, the duel of tactics and concentration compelling. Trevor stuck his nose down the pitch to every ball. A squadron of tanks couldn't have budged him. We were still there at tea. </p> <p>\"After that, daylight; and then it was like we were almost sailing into the sunset. At 20 past five Trevor got his 50; at about 25 to six I got my 100 with a sweep for four which Richie [Benaud] nearly caught.\" </p> <p>Watson was out for 109, Bailey following for 71. Match drawn, one for posterity. The brand new octogenarian chuckles on: \"The hubbub went on for weeks, didn't it.... well, for years really?\"</p>",

Look up any cuttings, they unfailingly call Watson a \"cultured\" wing-half and an \"elegant\" left-handed bat. \"How privileged I was to play with and against the best at close quarters: Len, technically the greatest bat ever; John Charles, the complete footballer; Len Shackleton, who had everything as an individual except being a link in the chain; and my old Sunderland wing-half buddy Arthur Wright, who had the lot except his due rewards for ball-playing brilliance.\" It was Tuesday June 30 1953 at Lord's which set Watson apart in the lore; from 11.30am to 5.51pm, to be exact. He had gone in the night before, at No5, with England at a perilous 12 for three against Australia, 332 behind with six and a bit hours to bat. Next morning Denis Compton was out for 33 at 12.40 and England were 73 for four. Trevor Bailey joined this same cheerful ancient who is now at the end of a phone-line 47 years later. \"Funny, isn't it? I can't remember five days ago but can vividly recall near 50 years. \"Denis never got credit for setting us on the road that day. He reined in his natural happy style and that rubbed off on me and Trevor. \"We still had to take the runs and by lunch we were on 116; 96 in the morning, damn good going, eh? An hour after lunch the new ball was due. That would decide it, everyone knew. As well as [Ray] Lindwall and [Keith] Miller, they had [Bill] Johnston and [Alan] Davidson, each ripe-cherry men all right. They took it dead on five to three. \"I can still feel the tension quadrupling out there in the middle and round the whole packed arena. The crowd kept increasing as word got round. Every delivery was of such importance, the duel of tactics and concentration compelling. Trevor stuck his nose down the pitch to every ball. A squadron of tanks couldn't have budged him. We were still there at tea. \"After that, daylight; and then it was like we were almost sailing into the sunset. At 20 past five Trevor got his 50; at about 25 to six I got my 100 with a sweep for four which Richie [Benaud] nearly caught.\" Watson was out for 109, Bailey following for 71. Match drawn, one for posterity. The brand new octogenarian chuckles on: \"The hubbub went on for weeks, didn't it.... well, for years really?\"",

However, the tourists didn't have it all their own way second time round, closing on 129 for five for an overall lead of 198 in a match they need to win to make the three-match series safe. In the seventh over of the day Pakistan's Yousuf Youhana was caught behind by wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana off the bowling of Chaminda Vaas for just eight - and the wickets continued to tumble for the rest of the day. Inzamam-ul-Haq started with a flourish of driven boundaries but settled down and advisedly took few risks. Sri Lankan skipper Sanath Jayasuriya dismissed Saeed Anwar, caught by Muttiah Muralitharan, for 74 with the total on 137. Muralitharan claimed his first victim of the Test in the 70th over as Younis Khan was caught close in by Mahela Jayawardene for eight. Inzamam comfortably held up one end but Shahid Afridi was next to go, caught driving by Russel Arnold to give Vaas his second wicket of the innings. Abdur Razzaq went for a duck, lasting only six balls before Jayawardene took his second catch off Muralitharan. Then debutant wicketkeeper Atiq-uz-Zaman lasted just 15 balls for a solitary single before edging Pramodya Wickremasinghe to Kaluwitharana. Waqar Younis (3) gave Jayawardene another comfortable catch and Arshad Khan (0) was trapped lbw as Muralitharan picked up two wickets in three balls to leave the home side on 177 for nine. Only 22 more runs were added before Marvan Atapattu took a simple catch at mid-off to dismiss Akhtar for five and end the Pakistan innings leaving Inzamam unbeaten on 58. Muralitharan was the pick of the Sri Lanka bowlers, taking four wickets for 77. Starting their second innings with a lead of 69, the tourists soon lost Jayasuriya, trapped lbw by paceman Waqar Younis. Arnold and Jayasuriya's fellow opener Atapattu put on 62, before the latter was held by Aamir Sohail for 29 off the bowling of off-spinner Arshad Khan. Waqar accounted for new batsman Jayawardene (10) lbw to leave Sri Lanka 90 for three in the 31st over.

The result is a provocative intervention, a fizz of life, a complex bewilderment in the heart of history made clean and civilised. Actually, it's an uneven show with a couple of underwhelming pieces: Jessica Stockholder has never exhibited in Scotland before and she is unlikely to win friends with a scrawny little drawing; Gareth Fisher's plaster and fibre optic sculptures don't intrigue. But there are some priceless moments. </p> <p>In one of the well-behaved rooms sit Claire Barclay's gorgeous, wicked and perverse contributions - a small hoop of rabbit's fur laid on the floor, a rush of kinky black feathers, and a pair of pigs' ears with silver rings displayed on the mantelpiece. As ever with Barclay, incongruity is all, as is a playful look at why some things are licit, others ruled taboo. Her piggy trophies are no stranger than the others displayed on every plinth and cabinet around them. And, in the human history of the house, Barclay knows that sex and the slaughter of animals will have both had their murky, starring moments. </p> <p>Best of all is Kenny Hunter's update on the historical bust. Placed in the gallery this represents everything the other rooms erase: the rhythm of life, laughter, music; but also the historical reality of the slavery on which the wealth that built houses like this was often raised. A big dub-head, a cool black bust on a rudimentary sound system - it is the wisest retort to this house . </p> <p> Until 30 April. 01261 818181</p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

The result is a provocative intervention, a fizz of life, a complex bewilderment in the heart of history made clean and civilised. Actually, it's an uneven show with a couple of underwhelming pieces: Jessica Stockholder has never exhibited in Scotland before and she is unlikely to win friends with a scrawny little drawing; Gareth Fisher's plaster and fibre optic sculptures don't intrigue. But there are some priceless moments. In one of the well-behaved rooms sit Claire Barclay's gorgeous, wicked and perverse contributions - a small hoop of rabbit's fur laid on the floor, a rush of kinky black feathers, and a pair of pigs' ears with silver rings displayed on the mantelpiece. As ever with Barclay, incongruity is all, as is a playful look at why some things are licit, others ruled taboo. Her piggy trophies are no stranger than the others displayed on every plinth and cabinet around them. And, in the human history of the house, Barclay knows that sex and the slaughter of animals will have both had their murky, starring moments. Best of all is Kenny Hunter's update on the historical bust. Placed in the gallery this represents everything the other rooms erase: the rhythm of life, laughter, music; but also the historical reality of the slavery on which the wealth that built houses like this was often raised. A big dub-head, a cool black bust on a rudimentary sound system - it is the wisest retort to this house . Until 30 April. 01261 818181 ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

She is not really looking at them.</p> <p>I am looking at these photographs in conference with a pig expert because an upcoming case turns on the proper method of dealing with sows in \"farrowing crates\". A farrowing crate, it turns out, is where the sow lives whilst she is waiting to give birth, whilst she is giving birth and after she has given birth to her piglets.</p> <p>The farrowing crate is a sort of rectangular pen not much bigger than the sow, made up of metal tubes and fastened to the floor at the corners. The sow can stand up in it or lie on her side in an exhausted-looking way but she cannot move anywhere or accidentally harm her piglets. There is an arrangement at one end which, as the expert explains to me, \"to be delicate about it, allows the piglets to be born but not right against the bars.\"</p> <p>A problem which arises with these farrowing crates, and which is an important point in our case, is that the sow's urine and dung can build up and cause corrosion of the metal posts at the corners of the crate. A strong sow might then be able to pull the crate from the floor and walk around with it on her back. This all leads in a somewhat obscure manner to my client's accident.</p> <p>So we are all sitting around a table: expert, client, solicitor, me, looking at these photographs and discussing the sows as if they were car components or cabbages being processed. After the farrowing process, I gather, the dancing piglets are taken off to some other part of the piggery in due course to be \"finished\".</p> <p>My client says rather sadly: \"I have been interested in pigs all my life, and now I can't work with them any more\". The expert clearly also has an interest in pigs. I am just having difficulty in understanding what kind of interest it is.</p> <p>After the conference, a friend rings up with the news that she is pregnant. Involuntarily, I imagine her lying on her side in a metal crate, giving birth to her baby against the bars and then lying in her own urine and dung until; her baby is taken away to be finished.</p> <p>Which leads me to think that I will have to restrict my pig practice severely on the grounds that I am emotionally unequipped to deal with pig pictures and cannot help looking forward to the day when all the sows rise up with their farrowing crates on their backs and roam free in the fields with their piglets. Although no doubt the pig expert could tell me any number of reasons why that would be an undesirable arrangement.</p>",

There is an arrangement at one end which, as the expert explains to me, \"to be delicate about it, allows the piglets to be born but not right against the bars.\" A problem which arises with these farrowing crates, and which is an important point in our case, is that the sow's urine and dung can build up and cause corrosion of the metal posts at the corners of the crate. A strong sow might then be able to pull the crate from the floor and walk around with it on her back. This all leads in a somewhat obscure manner to my client's accident. So we are all sitting around a table: expert, client, solicitor, me, looking at these photographs and discussing the sows as if they were car components or cabbages being processed. After the farrowing process, I gather, the dancing piglets are taken off to some other part of the piggery in due course to be \"finished\". My client says rather sadly: \"I have been interested in pigs all my life, and now I can't work with them any more\". The expert clearly also has an interest in pigs. I am just having difficulty in understanding what kind of interest it is. After the conference, a friend rings up with the news that she is pregnant. Involuntarily, I imagine her lying on her side in a metal crate, giving birth to her baby against the bars and then lying in her own urine and dung until; her baby is taken away to be finished. Which leads me to think that I will have to restrict my pig practice severely on the grounds that I am emotionally unequipped to deal with pig pictures and cannot help looking forward to the day when all the sows rise up with their farrowing crates on their backs and roam free in the fields with their piglets. Although no doubt the pig expert could tell me any number of reasons why that would be an undesirable arrangement.",

But education is such a major issue in America. Parents get hysterical if their children don't get As in kindergarten; but I found a high IQ is no indicator of success. Millionaires build empires on creativity and common sense.\" </p> <p>The millionaires Stanley studied had an average net worth of $9.2m (\u00a35.5m). The majority were entrepreneurs and 73% were described as academically average. He also found that they were not motivated by money or dreams of yachts in the Greek islands and castles in Marbella. \"Self-made millionaires do not look at money as a goal in itself. Ninety per cent told me their objective in starting out was to be independent, to follow their passions, to control their lives.\" </p> <p>So if intelligence, degrees, quiz shows and lottery winnings don't count, what does? Stanley sums it up neatly: \"First, millionaires choose a career in an area that matches their talents and interests. This ensures they are always motivated to work harder and longer than anybody else. </p> <p>\"Then they consistently think outside the box, seeing opportunities others have ignored. This is exactly what Richard Branson did with Virgin. He really is my hero. He consistently thinks outside the box to expand his empire.\" </p> <p>Consider also the case of Donald Sonner, the 64-year-old head of the Southern Bloomer Manufacturing Company in Tennessee, one of the millionaires Stanley interviewed. Sonner only completed one year of high school but was a millionaire by 24. He uses scrap cloth discarded by garment manufacturers to make underwear for prisons and gun-cleaning patches. \"Mr Sonner got rich by working hard and coming up with an idea nobody else had,\" says Stanley. </p> <p>The trick is to pick a career wedded to your interests, think laterally, then pair those elements with a disciplined work ethic. Stanley emphasised that all the millionaires in his survey set high goals and then worked around the clock to meet them. \"Millionaires say they work harder, place a high priority on honesty and integrity in business, and are prepared to take financial risks. They draw up plans and constantly evaluate them. They never lose sight of their goal.\" </p> <p>They also use time efficiently. Another millionaire Stanley interviewed was a Mr Benjamin, a school-bus driver who spent all his work breaks studying the stock market instead of messing about with his friends at the bus station. He began investing tiny amounts, taking risks and rolling with the punches when stocks took a tumble. He retired after 20 years, worth $3m. </p> <p>\"It's all about focus. Millionaires make a decision to tune out everything else and concentrate on one thing, be it creating a retirement fund, or launching a record label. Mr Benjamin focused on investing, schooled himself, and took calculated risks that paid off.\" </p> <p>In New York, where there are said to be 30,000 millionaires, all the talk is of Joseph Park, 28, who quit his well-paid job as a Wall Street trader to launch <a href=\"http://www.kozmo.com,\">www.kozmo.com,</a> a company that delivers goods to your home within an hour of you emailing an order. Analysts dismissed the idea as unworkable and Park was warned that he might be headed for bankruptcy. But the public loved the idea, business is booming and last month Park raised $100m in venture capital. Stanley says Park is a perfect example of someone having a novel idea, laser-like focus, motivation, and the gumption to take a risk. </p> <p> Stanley also found that psychologically, like Park, self-made millionaires were resolved to overcome predictions by school teachers or bank managers that they or their plans would not amount to much. </p> <p>Many, he discovered, used negative criticism of their efforts and characters as a spur. \"What is interesting is that many millionaires also had parents who never told them they would be losers if they didn't get into Harvard or Yale. They said you can do anything you want to, try everything. If you fail, keep going.\" </p> <p>So where will tomorrow's millionaires come from? Contrary to conventional wisdom, they are not lining up at the trough of the internet. Park, he says, was one of the lucky ones. </p> <p>In fact, Stanley's findings were that steel manufacturing, commercial equipment rental, dredging, mushroom-growing, outdoor advertising, commercial banking and construction contracting produced at least five times more wealth for their owners than for others in the same age and income brackets. \"Sure, some new millionaires will come from the web, but you will always need food, clothing and shelter, and the person who has a new idea in those areas, who is disciplined and sets goals, will become a millionaire,\" he predicts. </p> <p><strong>Rich list</strong></p> <p> Stanley discovered that self-made millionaires: </p> <p>* Choose their careers so they can take full advantage of their abilities and aptitudes. </p> <p>* Understand that the key factors rewarded by the economy are integrity, discipline, hard work, leadership, a supportive spouse, enjoying one's career and focus. </p> <p>* Have usually inherited less than 10% of their household net worth and 61% have never inherited, or received gifts of money. </p> <p>* Live a comfortable but not extravagant lifestyle, with little or no debt. </p> <p>* Take calculated financial risks and do not gamble. </p> <p>\u0095 The Millionaire Mind is published by Andrews McMeel, $26.95.

At an office party I found out he was doing this to all the young women teachers, so I put a note on the filing cabinet saying: \"Don't do any filing if you are alone in the room with (this man). He'll treat you like his personal property.\" He was so embarrassed that he stopped immediately. We could have gone to the headmaster, but the note was so effective we didn't need to make a fuss. </p> <p> <strong> Liz Oliver, 29 </strong> Retail manager </p> <p> I used to work with a man who pressed up against me in the doorway and did lots of \"accidental touching\". I ignored it for about three months then lost my temper and told him to get lost. The next week he went to my manager and complained about my work. When I found out I stormed into the boss's office to justify my position. I didn't complain about this man's behaviour because I was more furious about the slur on my abilities. After that he ignored me. Looking back, life would have been simpler if I had nipped the situation in the bud by standing hard on his foot every time he got close. I don't think yelling in the boss's office did me any favours. </p> <p> About five years ago I became very good friends with a male colleague. We would socialise a lot on our own and he developed a crush on me. Things turned nasty when I refused to have an affair. He sent me endless emails at home, including one with naked photographs of himself. I started being horrible to him to put him off but everyone at work just thought I was a bitch. I knew if I complained I'd get no sympathy because people were convinced we'd had an affair. In the end I left. Now if someone flirts I take it seriously and am much more cautious. I've stopped being too friendly with men in the office - it's not worth it. </p> <p> <strong> Theresa Woodcock, 35</strong> IT consultant </p> <p> I started a new job where the boss's behaviour made me feel uncomfortable. I was keen to make an impression so when he started giving me a lift in his car to meetings and taking me out to lunch I didn't protest. He used to look at me a lot and would use any excuse to touch my hand. One lunchtime he made that \"my wife doesn't understand me\" speech. I offered some advice and he kissed me on the cheek. I pulled away quickly but didn't say anything because I was embarrassed. I think he realised that he had crossed the line and backed off. If all this happened now I'd take my own car to meetings and make an excuse about not going for lunch. As you get older you get more confident. When you're young you don't know what to do. </p> <p> <strong> Jane McGowan, 30 </strong> Public relations manager </p> <p> I used to work for a small fashion company where the boss's brother was an old lech. He was 65 and I was 24. He'd come back from lunch rather worse for wear and go on at me about how sexy I was. It made me feel uncomfortable and I didn't really know what to do. I tried to ignore him but it didn't make any difference. As I became more confident in my job, I started giving him as good as I got. I sexually harassed him back. I'd say things like, \"Drop your trousers, then.\" In the end he left me alone because he wasn't getting the response he wanted. Sex pests are like bullies. Give as good as you get and they will leave you alone.</p> <p> You can contact the clockwatcher at the website or c/o The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Rd, London EC1R 3ER</p>",

He'd come back from lunch rather worse for wear and go on at me about how sexy I was. It made me feel uncomfortable and I didn't really know what to do. I tried to ignore him but it didn't make any difference. As I became more confident in my job, I started giving him as good as I got. I sexually harassed him back. I'd say things like, \"Drop your trousers, then.\" In the end he left me alone because he wasn't getting the response he wanted. Sex pests are like bullies. Give as good as you get and they will leave you alone. You can contact the clockwatcher at the website or c/o The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Rd, London EC1R 3ER",

Tonight's first major London gig shows up all the difficulties involved in transferring subtlety and intimacy to the live arena. The band are signed to Massive Attack's Melankolic label, and it shows: songs drift by on a bed of roughish hip hop breaks, dubwise bass, and unobtrusive guitar, keyboard and violin twiddlings. Phelim's voice is pitched somewhere between Tricky-style rapper and American singer-songwriter, despite coming from Bristol and being of Irish stock. The result is that opening trio Bedroom Dancing, Waiting for a Break and the playfully vengeful Trying Too Hard sound great, winning the audience round immediately, before the set slowly peters out, in dire need of a gear change, an injection of energy, a shuffle of the aural pack. </p> <p>The one attempt to alter the vibe is an acoustic version of Ordinary Man, handled only by Phelim and his writing partner Donni's celtic-flecked strumming. It's Phelim's most touching lyric, almost a New Man anthem in its self- effacing worship of the perfect, unrequited love. But this is deep in sensible, confessional AOR territory, and every tasteful nerd from Paul Simon to him out of Eels comes to mind. Not, I suspect, the effect that Day One are aiming for. </p> <p>But it would be unfair to damn Day One at this juncture. The album is a delight and, if the show wasn't a revelation, it did seduce the Camden Town Massive into Phelim's sly, philosophical way of thinking. All Day One need is a shot of their label bosses' intensity, and Phelim could emerge as the thinking woman's coffee-table crumpet. </p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",
