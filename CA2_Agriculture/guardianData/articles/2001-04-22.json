And Atalanta conceded a last-minute equaliser at Perugia when the Korean international Ahn Jung-Hwan struck from 20 yards. At the bottom of Serie A, Bari lie five points adrift after going down 4-2 at Bologna, for whom Giuseppe Signori scored twice. And Reggina won 3-0 at Verona in a game in which they were reduced to 10 men at the end of the first half. Francesco Cozza received a red card almost immediately after putting Reggina 2-0 up, but the visitors kept their nerve and their clean sheet while Verona had two players sent off in the second half. Napoli missed a chance to climb out of the relegation zone when they conceded an equaliser to a Roberto Baggio free-kick deep into injury-time of their game against Brescia at the Stadio San Paolo on Saturday.",

A conference call with a handful of governors of the Federal Reserve, a half-point cut in interest rates, an instant response from Wall Street, and that's that. Fears of recession have been banished and the good times are just around the corner. The maestro is back in charge of events. </p> <p>Well, that's one way of looking at it. For twitchy investors in the United States, it is probably the only way. For the alternative to believing that Alan Greenspan really can chart a course between a savage downturn and reinflating the bubble economy is that he has become the King Lear of the world's financial markets, raging impotently against forces he can no longer control. </p> <p>The idea that Greenspan is now a senile old man is as daft as the notion a year ago that he was infallible. He is doing the best he can with a fiendishly difficult situation, and last week's bold action has bought him some time. Yet the fact that US interest rates have been cut twice as quickly as they were in the recession of 1991 tells its own story - there is widespread distress in the American corporate sector caused by a combination of over-investment and weak demand. For the rest of the world watching over the past nine months as the talk has turned from soft to hard landing, it is time to estimate just how badly they would be affected by a worst-case US scenario. </p> <p>A fear that Britain may be sucked down by an American recession is one reason why the government is keen to have an election as soon as possible. The strong pound, the collapse of the technology bubble, the wettest weather on record and the foot and mouth epidemic are already affecting UK growth, and Britain's exposure to the US is considerable. Annual growth of 3%, claimant count unemployment at just under 1m and underlying inflation of 1.9% is as good as it gets at the moment. </p> <p>Concern that the US will suffer a painful period of adjustment after the excesses of the past few years is well-founded. The almost religious belief in the power of Greenspan means that the markets are pricing in a speedy recovery, consumers are continuing to spend and foreign investors are keeping faith with the dollar. Lower interest rates will cut the cost of borrowing, easing the pressure on balance sheets, but as the announcement of the past few weeks have shown, not by enough to prevent some pretty savage job cuts. </p> <p>As Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte and Touche, says: \"Large sections of the market still expect this to be a shallow slowdown, or if a recession, then merely one of the V-shaped variety. We think they have lost the plot. This is not a short-term slowdown resulting from an inventory correction but rather the beginning of a long-overdue adjustment which has its origins in an asset price bubble and over-spending. The current account deficit last year was 4.4% of GDP. In the absence of other changes, the US has to go on drawing in this amount of capital from the rest of the world, year after year. This is an unsustainable position.\" </p> <p>Eventually, Bootle will be proved right. Notwithstanding the well-documented and deserved success of a new breed of companies in the 1990s, the really rapid growth in the second half of the decade was the result of an economy living beyond its means. As with Britain in the late 1980s, underlying problems were masked by an over-valued currency, with the balance of payments the safety valve for inflationary pressure. What happened from the autumn of 2000 onwards was the start of a period of adjustment, once it became clear that stock market valuations were unrealistic in the light of what was happening to earnings. Having engineered that process through a tighter monetary policy last year, Greenspan has become concerned that the smooth descent to a more moderate period of growth could turn into a crash landing and executed an emergency u-turn. </p> <p>With the stock market still over-valued by 50% on some estimates, Bootle believes that even a cut in interest rates to 3% coupled with George Bush's planned tax cut will do no more than \"mitigate the scale and extent of the loss of output\". He argues that the \"need for adjustment is so large that there is no plausible package of rate reductions and tax cuts large enough to obviate a long period of below trend growth\". </p> <p>Charles Dumas, at Lombard Street Research, takes a slightly different view. While agreeing that the US is heading for trouble, he thinks there is the prospect of one last hurrah as the Fed pumps up demand by expanding the money supply. The excess liquidity will leak out into higher inflation, accompanied by a collapse in the dollar, which will result in a second leg of the recessionary process which will be far more serious than the current stage. </p> <p>As ever, the normal health warnings apply. Greenspan's financial Dunkirk may succeed against all the odds, but it would not be wise to bank on it. The conventional wisdom is that if the mighty US hits trouble there is precious little hope for plucky Britain. And, up to a point, the conventional wisdom is right. Britain relies heavily on trade, and the US is a key trading partner and is also responsible for large chunks of Britain's inward investment. Some companies have already begun to mothball expansion plans and cut their UK workforces as part of global retrenchment. </p> <p><strong> Cloud to the silver lining</strong><br> </p> <p>However, there are some causes for modest optimism. The first is that despite all the talk of globalisation, the lion's share of the economy is not really affected by what is happening beyond these shores. As Adair Turner says in his new book, Just Capital, in some ways economies are becoming more local, with an increasing share of national income spent on services such as hair-dressing or eating out rather than on goods that are internationally traded. However, the cloud to this silver lining is that the brunt of any US-induced slowdown would fall on the UK's manufacturing sector, thereby exacerbating the imbalance in the economy. </p> <p>The second reason to be cheerful is that there is scope for macro-economic policy to be eased. Last week's minutes from the Bank of England showed that three members of the monetary policy committee supported a more aggressive cut in interest rates last month, and further reductions look certain. Even without the deflationary impact of slower growth, underlying inflation is set to fall to around 1.5% over the next few months, giving the Bank plenty of scope to act. Peter Spencer, economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young Item club, believes that base rates could go as low as 3.5% - a full two percentage points below their current rate - should the circumstances require it. For that to happen, though, it seems likely that growth would have to weaken appreciably and inflation sink to 1%. Fiscal policy should also be supportive of growth over the coming months. The increases in public spending announced last year are only now coming on stream, and the size of the budget surplus means that there is potential for either tax cuts or further increases in spending. </p> <p>Finally, the economy may be stronger than Britain's army of pessimists imagine. This, of course, is a moot point. Like the US, the UK has been living beyond its means (although not by so much) and many of the old weakness - low productivity, poor skills, pockets of industrial underperformance - are still all too evident. But, as Spencer argues, the economy has had a lot chucked at it in recent months and has remained surprisingly robust. That could either mean that there has been an underlying improvement or that we are in denial. If it is the former, we could yet escape with an easing of growth to 2% this year and next, even if things turn really nasty in the US. Keep your fingers crossed.</p>",

In the worst-case scenario, where Alan Greenspan, the head of the US Federal Reserve, does not manage to save the stock market from plummeting, the Item club believes growth will dip below 2% and interest rates might have to be cut to as low as 3.5%. Unlike Mr Greenspan, the Bank still has some room for manoeuvre because there are few signs of price pressures in the British economy. Mr Bootle believes Britain's trade and investment balance with the rest of the world will be the main casualty of the Bank's attempts to ward off recession. The current account deficit could widen to 2.2% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2000. \"This, though, is a small price to pay for escaping recession,\" Mr Bootle said. \"Britain will have come through the crisis remarkably well - and the MPC will be the hero of the hour.\"",

      "body": "<p>This Wednesday is Renee Zellweger's birthday. It's also Al Pacino's, Ella Fitzgerald's and my Auntie Linda's. But far, far more importantly, it is National Secretary Day - aka Administrative Professionals' Day. National Secretary Day is just 24 little hours, slap-bang in the middle of Professional Secretaries Week. Like most things - potatoes, Cadillacs, Baywatch, the concept cruised on in from America, where next week they will be celebrating National Fork-Lift Truck Drivers Week with a parade and lots of candyfloss and streamers. </p> <p>It's easy to be sceptical about such events. Lord knows, I'd be the first in the queue to purchase shares in the Hallmark greetings cards empire - were it not for the fact that I have little spare change left to fritter away on stocks and shares, after shelling out \u00a32.20 for one of its cards. But perhaps we shouldn't knock a day that will allow secretarial and administrative staff to receive a little bit of credit for performing a string of thankless, lacklustre tasks day after day. </p> <p>We purchased four cards from the impressively large Clinton Cards selection, at a total of \u00a37.74. \"You must know a lot of secretaries,\" said the helpful gentleman behind the till. \"Four\" hardly constitutes a puddle of secretaries, let alone a whole typing pool, but we didn't like to quibble. </p> <p>Office Hours trapped Guardian style guru Caroline Roux, in the lift, to ask her what she thought of our National Secretary Day card selection. \"They're very downmarket,\" she said. \"They imply that all secretaries are not very sophisticated. They're not very metropolitan, they're very suburban.\" Caroline particularly objected to the card \"For A Special Secretary\". \"It looks like it's for a 60-year-old woman. It's very old-fashioned. In the same way that the word 'secretary' is very old-fashioned,\" she said, stylishly. \"And they're lacking in humour, which implies that secretaries are lacking in humour.\" </p> <p>Caroline commented that our selection veered between cards aimed at \"teens\" and those suited to \"old ladies\". \"There is nothing to suggest that these people are attractive, dynamic, fashion-conscious or design-conscious individuals. These are cards for people who still knit their own clothes,\" she concluded, with a hint of disgust, before flouncing off to somewhere so terribly hip and fashionable that you haven't even heard of it yet. </p> <p>It's all very well for the stylishly clad to dismiss such cards as \"suburban\". Frankly that's their job. But what would a genuine, bona fide secretary think if she - or he - received one of these attractive cards on Wednesday? Office Hours quizzed our Secs in the City columnist for her esteemed opinion. \"Erm, well, I don't reckon I'll be getting cards on Wednesday,\" she said, mournfully. No indeed, mademoiselle, especially not if they've twigged that it's you writing that column, poking fun at your workmates' every whim and whimper. \"I don't think I'd want any of them either. They're horrible.\" Why? \"Well they're like the sort of cards you get from your local corner shop because you forgot it was someone's birthday.\" I beg your pardon? \"Or the sort of cards your Uncle Geoff still sends you, even though you haven't seen him for 16 years.\" Right. \"I'd feel patronised if my boss gave me one of those. They're the greeting card equivalent of a box of Quality Street.\" </p> <p>True, but they don't even have the benefit of those hazelnut-caramel, purple-wrapped chocolates do they? But sadly, so very few things in life actually do. </p> <p>Our columnist particularly disliked two of the cards. \"I'm not a bloody cheerleader,\" she grumbled, of one, with its syrupy, Americanised list of the supposed roles of the secretary - \"postmasters, psychiatrists, supply clerks, schedulers, troubleshooters, messengers, consultants, psychics, coordinators, cheerleaders, errand runners, attentive listeners ...\". \"And what the hell is a supply clerk?\" </p> <p>With the other card, our columnist objected to the suggestion that secretaries \"invent really great filing systems\". \"Is that sarcasm?\" she asked. \"And I really hate that last one, the \"Smile the warmest smiles (even when they want to scream)\". Believe me, I bypass the smiling bit, and just go for the screaming option. Every time.\" </p> <p>So what would a secretary or PA actually like to receive on Wednesday? Last Friday, at online recruitment company <a href=\"http://www.fish4jobs.co.uk\">fish4jobs.co.uk</a>, five secretaries and executive support staff were allowed to job-swap with their bosses for a whole day. One of the swappers, Phylia Phoon, who is the executive assistant to the CEO Jonathan Turpin, decided to give all the PAs a day off. Good choice, Phoony. Turpin was left with the responsibility of booking the chauffeur-driven car. The PAs swanked off to lunch on the Strand, followed by a trip to the theatre. Back at the office, they had a change from the usual chores of filing, to be given a manicure. Thankfully not by Turpin. </p> <p>Our Secs in the City columnist reckons a manicure is a nice idea. \"You want something pampering. Something luxurious. Or even just to be taken out for a nice lunch or something. Although then you'd have to talk to your boss for at least an hour on your own, so maybe that's not such a great idea.\" </p> <p>Caroline Roux suggests \"a gift voucher for a pampering thing, or a very nice bunch of flowers\". But we're not talking chrysanths or carnations here. \"Fashion flowers,\" insists Caroline. Office Hours shudders to think what's fashionable in the flower world these days - probably radishes or something. </p> <p>Still, if all you get on Wednesday is a measly \"suburban\" card thanking you for the fact that you \"Always know the answers or where to find them\", well it's better than, erm, not getting a measly \"suburban\" card. And if you don't find anything at all, - no chocolates, no cards, no balloons or flowers, sitting on your desk on Wednesday morning, you know you've only got yourself to blame - after all, it's you who's in charge of the boss's diary, isn't it? </p> <p>(And PS, just so you're prepared, April 30 is Hairstylist Appreciation Day - no kidding).</p>",

Alongside them, John Lill has been working his way through Beethoven's five piano concertos. This is solid, if predictable programming, combining two box office favourites in nearly every concert without compromising on seriousness of purpose. The results have been reliably first class: this is an orchestra with an acclaimed history of Shostakovich performance, and Lill's Beethoven recordings are classics. </p> <p>For all Shostakovich's popularity, few of his symphonies give the listener an easy ride. The wartime Eighth is one of the bleakest of all. Where the other symphonies are more circumspect, the Eighth stares straight into the void. But, like all great tragedians, Shostakovich knows when to let up, even if those moments are always ambivalent. Deciding how to respond to these passages is a key performance issue - whether to read them as heavily ironic, or to allow them briefly to illuminate their dark surroundings. </p> <p>Although there is a respectable tradition of Shostakovich performance that favours an exaggerated, sarcastic approach, Lazarev demonstrated that a gentler touch can not only benefit dramatic pacing but convey the humanitarian ethos at the heart of this music. Shostakovich's summary of his most tragic symphony as \"life is beautiful\" is characteristically double-edged. For if, in the C major finale, you find yourself clutching at the shreds of light that never quite come together, you are probably not far from experiencing the kind of fragile hope that Shostakovich had in mind. Lazarev's sensitivity to Shostakovich's frail vision made this performance incredibly moving. The RSNO played superbly, with some especially distinguished moments, notably in Stephen West's hauntingly bittersweet cor anglais solo. </p> <p>If John Lill's initially rather workmanlike approach to Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto took a bit of getting used to, its purpose gradually became apparent - all Lill's reserves of spirituality and and dynamism were being stored up for the second and third movements. This made for a slightly mundane first movement; but the rest proved well worth waiting for. His performance of the slow movement confirmed Lill's place in the pantheon of great Beethoven interpreters.</p>",

Shostakovich's summary of his most tragic symphony as \"life is beautiful\" is characteristically double-edged. For if, in the C major finale, you find yourself clutching at the shreds of light that never quite come together, you are probably not far from experiencing the kind of fragile hope that Shostakovich had in mind. Lazarev's sensitivity to Shostakovich's frail vision made this performance incredibly moving. The RSNO played superbly, with some especially distinguished moments, notably in Stephen West's hauntingly bittersweet cor anglais solo. If John Lill's initially rather workmanlike approach to Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto took a bit of getting used to, its purpose gradually became apparent - all Lill's reserves of spirituality and and dynamism were being stored up for the second and third movements. This made for a slightly mundane first movement; but the rest proved well worth waiting for. His performance of the slow movement confirmed Lill's place in the pantheon of great Beethoven interpreters.",

The striker, scorer of eight goals this season (one for every \u00a32.75m), told the club his plans last week. 'I am in Paris because it is my choice. When I returned to PSG, I thought that people would see me as a good footballer who has returned to the Parisian suburbs after three years away.

The attack happened after the coach, Hugo Gallego, got out of a taxi in Guayaquil, and followed weeks of pressure to pick hefty utility player Dalo Bucaram. 'I'm convinced that this was a warning and that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow there will be another,' Gallego said from his bolthole in Medellin, Colombia - where Andres Escobar was shot dead in 1994. 'They were always insisting that I put this guy in the team. He is intelligent but has an excess of fat.' Bucaram's sinister dad Abadala - nicknamed 'the crazy one' - was sacked by Congress in 1997 on grounds of 'mental incapacity', then released a rock CD and burst into tears live on national television. Now, though, he says he wants a second crack at the presidency, and to see his son make a first-team breakthrough. Gallego plans to stay holed up in Medellin.

No one wants to surrender the chance of seeing Simon Russell Beale as Hamlet. But the theatre can include circus arts as well as Bulwer-Lytton. And the National is the place where its range should be proved. There's little point in having three auditoria if they're used to stage the same kind of drama. </p> <p>The composition of the National's Board - three knights (including the chairman, Christopher Hogg); one CBE (Joan Bakewell); one OBE (Sue MacGregor); and two writers (Ben Okri and Tom Stoppard) may be a symptom rather than a cause of staidness, but any incoming director should consider giving it a shake. That's all fine, but where are the younger writers or directors who might supply intelligence about other young talents?

      "bodyText": "Evidence that the Yugoslav army deployed a unit for burning bodies and erasing any trace of Albanians murdered during the war in Kosovo has emerged from the unlikeliest of places - a Yugoslav court martial trying three of its own soldiers. The existence of the 'trace-erasing' unit, testified by five soldier witnesses, is proof the army covered up war crimes. The disclosure comes three years after The Observer first reported evidence from refugees that bodies of massacred Albanians were burnt in furnaces in the Trepca mining complex. Forensic scientists working for the war crimes tribunal at The Hague have identified grave sites containing around 4,000 corpses, but 3,000 bodies have never been found - their traces have been erased. One Yugoslav Special Forces paramilitary who had been at a massacre site in South-western Kosovo said: 'I saw some terrible things, but I am not going to tell you because I do not want to betray my fellow Serbs.' The court martial in Nis found two soldiers and an officer guilty of murdering an elderly Albanian couple, the critical evidence coming from four soldiers and the war diary of army reservist Nebojsa Dimitrijevic, which said 'two people were cleansed'. During the trial, chaired by military judge Radenko Miladinovic - a Milosevic-era appointee, who was on Europe's list of banned Yugoslavs for jailing a journalist - it emerged that Dimitrijevic and other witnesses were members of the 'trace-erasing unit'. In Dimitrijevic's pre-trial statement, he said the unit in Gornja Susica, near Pristina, included 'a subdivision tasked with body removal and burning up the remains'. The murders took place in the aftermath of the Nato attack on Yugoslavia. Reservists in War Unit 5778, based in the Serb town of Gracanica, south-east of Pristina, fled Nato bombs on 27 March 1999, after two soldiers died and seven were injured. They were ordered to occupy two Albanian villages, Saskovac and Gornja Susica, and to 'cleanse' the inhabitants. Feriz Krasniqi stood in his front garden and told the advancing soldiers that his wife, Rukija, was paralysed and unable to leave her bed. Captain Dragisa Petrovic, angered by the old Albanian's refusal to budge, ordered soldiers Nenad Stamenkovic, Tomica Jovic and Dimitrijevic to kill them. Dimitrijevic aimed his gun at Krasniqi but couldn't pull the trigger. At that moment, Jovic fired a burst and killed Krasniqi. Sta menkovic went into the house and shot the wife. The trace-erasing unit was part of the battalion stationed in Gornja Susica, commanded by a Lt Stojiljkovic. He told the court that when he came to the village, he found Krasniqi's body and ordered two soldiers to bury it. Another three bodies were found later. Dimitrijevic was in a group of soldiers charged with burning remains. Svemir Mladenovic and Bratislav Zdravkovic said Petrovic had ordered them to dig up a carbonised body and rebury it. Jovic and Stamenkovic were sentenced to four and a half years each for the murders, and Petrovic four and a half years for abetting them.

      "bodyText": "Sailing by cargo ship Do cargo boats take passengers as used to be the case? Where can I find out more? J. Tomlinson, Lancs Freighters still visit almost every destination you could imagine, and many of these vessels take a limited number of passengers. These services are good value, but only in comparison to taking a cruise. Typically you'll pay about \u00a385-\u00a3100 for each day of your voyage. Transatlantic voyages take about seven days without stops, while going all the way to Australia takes about 45 days, depending on route and ports of call. Facilities are functional, but seeing life on a commercial ship can be lots of fun and an unusual travel experience. Contact Strand Voyages (020 7836 6363) for more information or The Cruise People, a travel agency which specialises in booking passengers onto cargo ships, (020 7723 2450).

So if you want to get beyond Ramsgate, you should be making those job applications, visa requests and agency enrolments now. </p> <p> <strong>2 Consider</strong> voluntary work if you have not been abroad before or are feeling nervous about the experience. 'It's a bit of a cocooned environment,' says David Woodworth, editor of Summer Jobs Abroad 2001 (\u00a39.99, Vacation Work Publications, <a href=\"http://www.vacationwork.co.uk\">www.vacationwork.co.uk</a>). You will probably get a lot of help with the paperwork, have your accommodation arranged for you, be met at the airport and be working with other English speakers. Contact details of Willing Workers on Organic Farms and other organisations are available in books such as Summer Jobs Abroad 2001. </p> <p> <strong>3 Recognise</strong> that tourism and agriculture are the biggest recruiters of seasonal summer jobs. Tour guides, catering staff and chambermaids are recruited in large numbers - and then there are the more demanding roles such as karaoke night organisers in Greece and disc jockeys on cruise ships. </p> <p> <strong>4 Understand</strong> that France is probably the easiest EU country to find work in. Used to Britons coming over for camping holidays, for instance, it needs English-speaking staff to cater for these tourists. It is also a good place for novice travellers to spend their first summer - since it will not take you long to return home for a weekend if you are homesick. </p> <p> <strong>5 Think</strong> of gaining a job on the spot if you leave it too late and can cope with the possibility that you will not find something. Building sites are an obvious source of work for men. </p> <p> <strong>6 Remember</strong> that, if you are applying in advance, you probably make yourself more attractive if you can work the whole season. The internet is making it far easier to send CVs to businesses abroad. </p> <p> <strong>7 Appreciate</strong> the advantages of a summer on a turtle conservation project in Greece. 'It stands out on your CV and is far better than being captain of the school hockey team,' says Woodworth. 'It shows that you have stamina and can organise yourself.' Living abroad changes most people - making them more confident, less dependent on families and more broad-minded. Most people who want a post abroad should be able to get one if they try hard enough. </p>",

You will probably get a lot of help with the paperwork, have your accommodation arranged for you, be met at the airport and be working with other English speakers. Contact details of Willing Workers on Organic Farms and other organisations are available in books such as Summer Jobs Abroad 2001. 3 Recognise that tourism and agriculture are the biggest recruiters of seasonal summer jobs. Tour guides, catering staff and chambermaids are recruited in large numbers - and then there are the more demanding roles such as karaoke night organisers in Greece and disc jockeys on cruise ships. 4 Understand that France is probably the easiest EU country to find work in. Used to Britons coming over for camping holidays, for instance, it needs English-speaking staff to cater for these tourists. It is also a good place for novice travellers to spend their first summer - since it will not take you long to return home for a weekend if you are homesick. 5 Think of gaining a job on the spot if you leave it too late and can cope with the possibility that you will not find something. Building sites are an obvious source of work for men. 6 Remember that, if you are applying in advance, you probably make yourself more attractive if you can work the whole season. The internet is making it far easier to send CVs to businesses abroad. 7 Appreciate the advantages of a summer on a turtle conservation project in Greece. 'It stands out on your CV and is far better than being captain of the school hockey team,' says Woodworth. 'It shows that you have stamina and can organise yourself.' Living abroad changes most people - making them more confident, less dependent on families and more broad-minded. Most people who want a post abroad should be able to get one if they try hard enough.",

After I'd booked, friends told me that the island was notorious for its all-night discos, but the rugged beauty of Zakynthos was not hard to find. It is around every corner, minutes from the tourist apartments and lodgings. Accept that the island's beaches and small seaside towns belong to the clubbers and walk just a kilometre along the coast or inland and you find lush green olive groves, mountain villages and wooded hillsides, isolated rocky shores and sparkling seascapes. </p> <p>The second time I went to Zakynthos - for a rest and relaxation holiday at a private club - all these delights were there in abundance and not a hotel or disco in sight. The Peligoni Club nestles into a rocky hillside in the north-east of the island and is as far as you can get geographically and spiritually from the over-development of the south. The stone clubhouse and vine-shaded terraces barely impact on the natural uninhabited surroundings. There are a cluster of buildings and patios, a couple of diving platforms and a stepladder to take you straight from rocks to sea plus a concrete apron for windsurfers and sailors. Within a short drive, and similarly secluded and peaceful, are the apartments, villas and stone cottages where Peligoni guests sleep, have breakfast and can, if they feel particularly antisocial, laze about all day. Some of the villas have pools. </p> <p>Vanessa and Johnny, who run the Peligoni Club, discovered the bay some 20 years ago. They liked it so much they bought a small house - and then another, and another. Friends came and sailed and painted and told more friends. Now they can accommodate 60 or more people and still maintain a personal welcome for each guest. </p> <p>If you went and did nothing but eat wonderfully prepared fresh food, swim and drink the local wine, after a week you would probably come back fully restored from almost every modern anxiety. But for those who prefer to take their relaxation in more structured form, Peligoni has started offering 'restoration holidays', relieving you even of the worry of how to relax. </p> <p>This year, they will be held in June and September, when the weather is at its most benign and the hillsides are carpeted with wild flowers. These are the island's natural relaxants but they will be supplemented with stress management, meditation and yoga. Optional extras include massage, lymph drainage and reflexology. </p> <p>The days fell into an easy routine with the group (around a dozen) meeting for joint activities in the cooler mornings followed by a trip and lunch. One memorable lunch was taken at a taverna inland where owner Costas invited us after the meal into a tiny living room and sang a song of such haunting beauty that I would go back again just to hear him. Vanessa and Johnny are well known and loved around the island and their presence opens doors into worlds that most tourists never see. Afternoons were generally free for sailing or windsurfing (at no extra cost), dozing or reading followed by a rest and a shower and then a long dinner at the club. This was always outdoors, and could be peaceful or raucous depending on the mood of different groups and the amount of wine being drunk. </p> <p>I was not too sure about some of the organised relaxation activities. What, I thought, was the point of closing my eyes and imagining a Disney landscape of mountains and waterfalls when my open eyes could engage with the most beautiful natural landscape in the Ionian Sea? None the less, being with the group was tremendous fun and our childish lack of reverence for some elements of the programme - some of us found pagan sun worship outside a Greek Orthodox monastery a little absurd - surely did us as much good as meditating. Laughter is very restorative. </p> <p>Homer mentions Zakynthos, calling it the 'woody island' and notes in the Iliad that its men were among the crew of Odysseus's twelve crimson-prowed ships. The tourist board claims Homer also said that all who come to the island fall under its spell. The lack of building on the shore line in the north makes it easy to indulge in Odyssey fantasies if you take a boat or kayak out into the bay. Odysseus's tomb is said to be on neighbouring Cephalonia, of which we will soon be hearing much when Captain Corelli's Mandolin is released early next month. </p> <p>Holidays offering, yoga, meditation and promising to change lives have become increasingly popular in recent years but they are a hit and miss affair depending on the set-up and the attitudes of your fellow-seekers after enlightenment.

      "body": "<p>Whether it's historic churches, out of the way bistros or good, old-fashioned sun, sea and sand, most holidays are all about the pursuit of pleasure. Pain, discomfort and exhaustion don't normally feature high on our happy-holiday must-have list. Unless you choose to spend your vacation running a marathon, which is what my friend Alan, his brother Robert and I chose to do with our early Easter break. </p> <p>A fortnight ago, the twenty-fifth Paris marathon got under way on a cold and drizzly Sunday morning. Miserable weather for most holidaymakers, but we and our 27,000 fellow runners couldn't have hoped for better conditions for our tortuous tour of Paris. Unlike the London marathon, which shamefacedly unwinds itself around mean little suburban roads, the Paris race is a celebration of the French capital. Starting down the Champs Elys\u00e9es towards the Place de la Concorde, the Obelisk and the millennium wheel, the route follows the city's broad boulevards to the Bois de Vincennes, meanders back along the Seine, through the shadows of Notre Dame and past the Eiffel Tower before finishing in a glorious burst up Avenue Foch to the Arc de Triomphe. </p> <p>We arrived the day before the race - having narrowly avoided missing our connection from Waterloo when the train flouted rolling-stock convention and left early, not late. Needless to say, it still managed to arrive behind schedule. We bookedin to a hotel near the Gare du Nord, where the manager was very excited about our participation in ' la grande course'. In French that even we could understand, he urged us to ' Courez vite'. </p> <p>Having unpacked (our luggage seemed to be made up almost entirely of breathable undergarments, elastic knee supports, plasters and various lubricants), we headed off to find an Italian restaurant where we could load up on pasta - all marathon runners 'carb up' before a big race as the event consumes carbohydrates quicker than seven-year-olds eat Smarties. It was a 'dry' meal as runners have to avoid the dehydrating effects of alcohol and caffeine. This put us in the possibly unique position of being three lads on holiday in a foreign capital, strolling around the streets looking for entertainment... completely sober. I told you marathon running was fun. </p> <p>We soon headed back to our room to do what all runners do before a race: compare treads on trainers, discuss whether we should run in vests or T-shirts (hilariously, I had written 'Keep up, Alan' on the back of mine) and make puerile jokes about Vaseline. Robert then showed off the talking photobox his wife and kids had given him which shouted 'Go Robert Go!' when you pushed a button, and Alan put the good-luck card his family had made for him on the mantelpiece. I saw my wife's handwriting on a folded note in the bottom of my bag. Discovering it was just an old shopping list, I had to make do with the hotel cleaner's cry of ' Bonne chance' as we left. </p> <p>Standing beneath the Arc de Triomphe waiting for the starter's pistol, we anxiously ate as many bananas and Jelly Babies as we could stomach. (Alan assured us the glycogen content of the sweets makes them the ideal athletic snack, though none of us could recall seeing Linford Christie downing any before his races.) We soaked up the glorious multicultural camaraderie that every marathon conjures up and tried to ignore the smell of several thousand digestive systems nervously working overtime. Robert told us that we should try to imagine we were fully loaded Jumbos sitting on the runway and that as we flew round the course we'd get lighter and lighter. Alan and I weren't quite sure what he was getting at, and decided to try and mentally visualise ourselves successfully finishing the race instead. We soon stopped when we realised that even imagining a marathon was gruelling. </p> <p>The first Paris marathon took place in 1896 and was won by an Englishman, Len Hurst, who stopped a few miles before the finish to down a glass of champagne and then crossed the line six minutes ahead of his nearest rival. Who knows, maybe this would be our year. Either way, we felt confident we'd do better than the seven runners who from some misplaced sense of history had chosen to run barefoot. </p> <p>At 9am, we get under way and all along the route crowds gather to cheer us on. Our ears ring with cries of ' Allez, allez, allez'. We have our names written on our T-shirts and people step out to shout ' Bon courage, Martin ' and ' Bonne chance, Alan'. We feel both heroic and glamorous, something none of us has ever felt before. Bands play, an all-male cheerleading troupe lifts our spirits and a lone piper almost makes me burst into tears. At one point I discard an empty water bottle into the path of a fellow runner. ' Pardon, monsieur,' trips off my tongue. 'That's all right mate,' comes the reply. With six miles to go, we pass a feeding station where they are handing out glasses of red wine. Not sharing the same joie de vivre as our Gallic competitors, we wimp out and go for sickly energy boosters instead. </p> <p>With only a couple of miles to go, I feel I can't take another step, but a comradely hand on the shoulder and grip on my elbow from a nameless fellow runner keeps me plodding on and somehow seems to sum up the genuine bonhomie that binds all the competitors. </p> <p>The race's winner is the Kenyan Simon Biwott, who pipped me at the line by a mere 83 minutes. I'd finished in a personal best of 3 hours 32 minutes. Having collected our medals and rewarded ourselves with the first beer in a week, we make our way back to the Gare du Nord and the train home. The race may have lasted only a few hours, but the memories of our marathon weekend will stay with me for a lifetime.</p> <p><strong>Leaders of the pack... 10 of the most unusual big races on the planet</strong></p> <p><strong>The oldest: </strong>In its 106th year, the Boston Marathon is the father of city races. You must be able to run a 3hr 10 min race to enter. </p> <p><strong>The most dangerous:</strong> You could bump into rhinos, cheetahs and leopards on the Safari Marathon in Kenya. Runners are protected by game wardens patrolling the route.</p> <p><strong>The easiest:</strong> You don't get much flatter than the Dutch city of Rotterdam, but it's not a complete walk-over. Last year running times were marred by a force four wind.</p> <p><strong>The biggest:</strong> About 30,000 runners are taking part in today's 21st London Marathon.</p> <p><strong>The most scenic:</strong> Some 3,700 steps have to be climbed during the The Great Wall Marathon. Part of the run is on the wall itself.</p> <p><strong>The hardest:</strong> Participants in the Marathon des Sables have to cross 150 miles of the Sahara in Morocco, carrying all their food and gear. It takes a week.</p> <p><strong>The highest:</strong> Four of the world's five highest mountains can be seen during the five-day 100-mile Himalayan Stage Race.</p> <p><strong>The most northerly:</strong> The Midnight Sun Marathon is run at night in Tromso, Norway, where the sun doesn't set from May to July.</p> <p><strong>The newest:</strong> The reggae beat might help you pace yourself during the Reggae Marathon, which debuts in Jamaica this December.</p> <p><strong>The lowest:</strong> Runners descend 1,300 metres to the lowest point on earth during the Dead Sea Marathon in Jordan.</p> <p><strong>Holidays on the run </strong></p> <p>Travel companies have responded to the increasing popularity of marathon running by organising race packages.

Leaders of the pack... 10 of the most unusual big races on the planet The oldest: In its 106th year, the Boston Marathon is the father of city races. You must be able to run a 3hr 10 min race to enter. The most dangerous: You could bump into rhinos, cheetahs and leopards on the Safari Marathon in Kenya. Runners are protected by game wardens patrolling the route. The easiest: You don't get much flatter than the Dutch city of Rotterdam, but it's not a complete walk-over. Last year running times were marred by a force four wind. The biggest: About 30,000 runners are taking part in today's 21st London Marathon. The most scenic: Some 3,700 steps have to be climbed during the The Great Wall Marathon. Part of the run is on the wall itself. The hardest: Participants in the Marathon des Sables have to cross 150 miles of the Sahara in Morocco, carrying all their food and gear. It takes a week. The highest: Four of the world's five highest mountains can be seen during the five-day 100-mile Himalayan Stage Race. The most northerly: The Midnight Sun Marathon is run at night in Tromso, Norway, where the sun doesn't set from May to July. The newest: The reggae beat might help you pace yourself during the Reggae Marathon, which debuts in Jamaica this December. The lowest: Runners descend 1,300 metres to the lowest point on earth during the Dead Sea Marathon in Jordan. Holidays on the run Travel companies have responded to the increasing popularity of marathon running by organising race packages. Here are some sample deals from Leisure Pursuits, which specialises in marathon, cycling and triathlon packages (0800 018 6101): Prague Marathon (20 May) includes race entry, flights, one-way transfer, three nights at city centre hotel, with breakfast, from \u00a3445 per person, twin share Chicago Marathon (7 Oct) package includes three nights' accommodation in four-star hotel, flights with Virgin Atlantic, airport transfers and guaranteed race entries, from \u00a3884 twin-share Reggae Marathon, Jamaica (8 Dec): from \u00a31,032 for seven nights twin-share, flights, transfers and race.",

      "body": "<p>There is a pinnacle that stands in the sea off the south coast of Tasmania that, for a climber, is one of the world's 'must dos'. It is 250 feet high and 12ft wide and it is utterly beautiful. It is called the Totem Pole and I had to have a go at it. On Friday 13 February 1998, I attempted the climb. As I was descending on the rope a boulder fell 90ft and smashed my skull in. The rescue was long and involved and I had to undergo six hours of surgery on my brain. I couldn't speak for a month and one side of my body was left paralysed. </p> <p>Three years on I'm still recovering. It's a slow process. Many people with brain injuries can't see an end to it; they give up on their physiotherapy or neuro-psychology and their families give up on them too. I wanted to prove to people like myself that you don't have to give up on life just because you have a head injury. You can still follow your passion, whether it be cooking, reading or hang gliding. My passion happens to be mountaineering. </p> <p>I decided to climb Mount Kenya, the second largest mountain in Africa (after Kilimanjaro), famed for its mighty twin peaks of Bation (5,199m) and Nelion (5,188m). At this stage of my recovery the peaks were too big a challenge for me. But Point Lenana is only 667ft lower than Nelion and can be climbed with minimal technical know-how or ability. </p> <p>I would be accompanied by my wife Jane, who was part of my nursing team in Tasmania, and a small film crew from BBC Wales that wanted to make a documentary about the climb. I immersed myself in raising \u00a35,000 for Headway, the brain injury association, but as the departure date grew nearer I began to get edgy. Would I be able to climb it? What if I found the terrain too tough? What if I couldn't cope with the altitude? I started having nightmares about the summit ridge where the rock would crumble, turn to dust and my feet would be left pedalling loose shale. </p> <p>There are several routes up Mt Kenya. We were taking the most beautiful, the Chogoria route up the east side. In Chogoria, we hired nine porters and a guide and began the 23km drive up the boggiest road imaginable. I lost count of the number of times we had to get out of the Land Rovers and start digging or rocking our way out of the mire. We finally reached Urumandi Lodge at 3,000m, the starting point for the long trek up. Strange gruntings and howlings disturbed our sleep but we awoke to blazing sunshine. I decided to walk the short distance to the next camp, just to get me acclimatised; 200m before the campsite I was forced to stop and deal with painful blisters caused by my foot splint rubbing under my toes. </p> <p>The next day's trek up to a flat ridge was rewarded with the most beautiful view I have ever seen. On the other side orange cliffs dropped steeply to a flat-bottomed valley 1,000m below and, in the distance, the Vivian Falls tumbled down from the glistening waters of Lake Michaelson. </p> <p>There was still a long way to walk that day and I was already feeling giddy with the altitude. I fell off the path and tumbled down a small drop but Bernard, our guide, was there as always to pick me up. We scrambled up a cliff face and as I grabbed on to the rock holds I remembered their texture. I was a good climber once. Now I had to have Jane behind me and Bernard on the outside making sure I didn't fall. But I was doing it! I was climbing Mt Kenya. I was actually on my way. </p> <p>When we came to a stream at 4,000m I couldn't go on. We were a couple of miles from our camp but I just had to stop so we put the tents up and got a brew on. It was here that, for the first time since my accident, I felt the intense beauty of the mountain - indeed, the beauty of any mountain, from Snowdonia to the Himalayas. I sobbed uncontrollably. All those emotions that I had felt when I had been to those wondrous places came flooding back to me. I had held those memories at bay for too long for fear of hurting myself. Now it was like I was seeing, hearing, smelling and feeling those mountains all at once. </p> <p>The next day we walked the short distance to Mintos Camp at 4,300m. I was showing most of the symptoms of mountain sickness: headaches, lethargy, dizziness and lack of co-ordination. I needed an acclimatisation day and couldn't have chosen a more impressive spot for it. It was like a scene from Star Trek with the weird rocks and plants all around, the strangest of which has to be the giant groundsel, which stands 4m high with a massive pineapple head. </p> <p>The fifth day saw an ant line of porters, film crew and climbers trailing up the mountain on what was to be my most arduous test. In his typical laid-back style, Bernard pointed out a ridge in the distance and told us that the hut was just the other side of it. After four hours of hard, sweaty work we rounded the ridge. The hut was nowhere in sight. I had to scramble across a further couple of kilometres of loose scree and across another ridge before I eventually reached the camp. We now saw several brightly coloured tents among the moraine. We had hardly seen a soul until then and were a bit put out to have our solitude interrupted. </p> <p>The night was freezing cold and when the alarm sounded at 5.15am there was rime ice all over the inside of the tent. We started the final 250m to the summit in the half-light of dawn. After about an hour we came to the first difficult section. I didn't have a rope on and felt the exposure, the void below me, with a dizzying pressure from above. I got stuck at one step on the sharp ridge for 15 minutes. Imagine a shelf sticking out at waist height with nothing underneath it. Now imagine you only have the use of one arm and one leg. With Jane and Bernard on either side of me I hopped in the air and spun my bottom round so that I could perch on the ledge. In a sitting position I walked my cheeks backward onto the projection and with my hand swung my leg up onto it. I lifted my other leg up on its own and then powered up on just one leg. I was shaking with fear, and told Jane that I would need a rope from now on. </p> <p>A little further along the ridge was a wall that I had to be belayed up. The joy of actually climbing again, on a rope, was overwhelming. My face was split from ear to ear with a huge grin. I made it quite easily and straightaway my mind was occupied by imaginings of harder climbs. </p> <p>The Bation and the Nelion were just on the other side of the Lewis glacier and we could see the summit hut glowing in the sun. Just one last step of about a few metres and we had made it. After the photos and hugs I felt strangely deflated. I think it was because now I had to search for a new goal. I thought I would be emotional and teary but I must have been all cried out. </p> <p>I fell on the descent and was left dangling painfully from the rope around my waist. Bernard came to the rescue again. As we approached Minto's campsite it began to hail. The hail then turned to snow and put down six inches in three hours. </p> <p>Had we been a day later we wouldn't have climbed Mt Kenya. It had been the most arduous climb of my life and I was sated again for a while... I was still a climber.</p> <p><strong>Tips to the top</strong></p> <p><strong>Best ways up:</strong> There are three main routes to climb Mt Kenya. The quickest and most popular is Naro Moro on the south-west of the mountain but be warned: part of the walk takes you through a vertical bog. Sirimon on the north-west offers great forest walking, while Chogoria in the east is the most dramatic and beautiful route. Tarmac roads lead to towns at the starts of the three main routes up the mountain. </p> <p><strong>When to go:</strong> Between mid-December and February or July and August during the dry season.</p> <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Point Lenana, the third highest point on Mt Kenya, is a good target if you are a walker. A technical climb is required to reach the summit of Bation at 17,058ft.</p> <p>Take it slowly - many people try to ascend too quickly and end up suffering from altitude sickness. A minimum of four days is required to climb to Point Lenana, the main destination for walkers. Fluid loss occurs rapidly at high altitudes accentuating altitude sickness so drink copious amounts of fluids.</p> <p>Be prepared to rough it.

      "body": "<p>Every August, the village of Marciac's population of 200 increases a hundred-fold as 20,000 jazz lovers from all over the world descend on this sleepy corner of south-west France to watch the world's leading jazz artists perform in a marquee on the village rugby pitch. </p> <p>Jazz enthusiasts take their music seriously. So seriously that they are prepared to cross continents in order to hear their favourite artists perform and to rub shoulders with fellow aficionados. Which may explain why audiences for jazz festivals are growing faster than for any other type of music festival worldwide. </p> <p>'Numbers are increasing simply because jazz today is more diverse. Artists at these gigs perform everything from acid, to dixie, to funk, to smooth, to latin jazz,' says saxophonist Igor Butman, who owns a fashionable jazz bar in Moscow. 'Festivals attract a typical audience of stressed out, cash rich, time poor thirty-somethings. They're tired of the commercialism and tack surrounding rock festivals and aren't quite ready to give into the sedate armchair world of classical concerts. They want to chill out but don't want to rough it.' </p> <p>The festivals, many of which are free, can last anything from a few days to a few months, and the larger events attract up to 200,000 people. They are often held in dramatic or enchanting surroundings, tend to be extremely well organised (with well developed and informative websites) and attract major artists from all over the world. </p> <p>It is worth noting that tickets, flights and accommodation for some of the most popular events book up months in advance. For some festivals it is more cost-effective to book flights and accommodation separately from the tickets, while for others you will need to book a package. </p> <p>The following guide shows you how to get the most out of 10 of the best and most established festivals, including inside tips on where to stay, where to eat and where to go to rub shoulders with the performers. </p> <p> <strong> 1 San Francisco Jazz Festival </strong><br> (24 Oct-4 Nov) </p> <p> The biggest and probably the best festival in the world, the city lives and breathes jazz for two weeks in October, when the good and the great perform in venues throughout San Francisco. Venues such as the Masonic Auditorium, Bimbo's Club and Paramount Theatre based in and around the Civic Centre and Yerba Buena attract major audiences and performers, although you'll hear jazz in every bar you happen to stray into during that period. </p> <p><strong> Performers: </strong> Over the years, Dizzie Gillespie, Oscar Petersen and Nina Simone have all performed at this event.

      "bodyText": "Every August, the village of Marciac's population of 200 increases a hundred-fold as 20,000 jazz lovers from all over the world descend on this sleepy corner of south-west France to watch the world's leading jazz artists perform in a marquee on the village rugby pitch. Jazz enthusiasts take their music seriously. So seriously that they are prepared to cross continents in order to hear their favourite artists perform and to rub shoulders with fellow aficionados. Which may explain why audiences for jazz festivals are growing faster than for any other type of music festival worldwide. 'Numbers are increasing simply because jazz today is more diverse. Artists at these gigs perform everything from acid, to dixie, to funk, to smooth, to latin jazz,' says saxophonist Igor Butman, who owns a fashionable jazz bar in Moscow. 'Festivals attract a typical audience of stressed out, cash rich, time poor thirty-somethings. They're tired of the commercialism and tack surrounding rock festivals and aren't quite ready to give into the sedate armchair world of classical concerts. They want to chill out but don't want to rough it.' The festivals, many of which are free, can last anything from a few days to a few months, and the larger events attract up to 200,000 people. They are often held in dramatic or enchanting surroundings, tend to be extremely well organised (with well developed and informative websites) and attract major artists from all over the world. It is worth noting that tickets, flights and accommodation for some of the most popular events book up months in advance. For some festivals it is more cost-effective to book flights and accommodation separately from the tickets, while for others you will need to book a package. The following guide shows you how to get the most out of 10 of the best and most established festivals, including inside tips on where to stay, where to eat and where to go to rub shoulders with the performers. 1 San Francisco Jazz Festival (24 Oct-4 Nov) The biggest and probably the best festival in the world, the city lives and breathes jazz for two weeks in October, when the good and the great perform in venues throughout San Francisco. Venues such as the Masonic Auditorium, Bimbo's Club and Paramount Theatre based in and around the Civic Centre and Yerba Buena attract major audiences and performers, although you'll hear jazz in every bar you happen to stray into during that period. Performers: Over the years, Dizzie Gillespie, Oscar Petersen and Nina Simone have all performed at this event. This year's line-up includes Dianne Reeves and Joshua Redman. Where to stay: Stay at the Prescott Hotel (001 415 563 0303) where the stars hang out for a chat and jam after the performance. Rooms cost from $150-$249 (\u00a3109-180) a night.

Where to eat: Eat at Clouds restaurant, which is close to the festival venues for Californian fare (excellent crab cakes, spinach salads, seared tuna) at 720 Howard Street (001 415 278 0432).

      "body": "<p>Tomorrow is the 33rd birthday of Timothy James McVeigh. He will spend it as he has spent the past six years - on a slow countdown to death. America's most infamous man has 23 days left until what he anticipates will be his 'greatest moment' - when, on 16 May, he will be the first federal, as opposed to state, prisoner to be executed in the US for 37 years.</p> <p>Much effort has gone into ensuring the Oklahoma City bomber is dispatched efficiently in what will be a showcase execution. The death chamber at Indiana's Terre Haute penitentiary is new, the table to which he will be strapped has never been used, and the white sheet which will shroud his gangly 6ft 1in form is in its sealed, cellophane wrapper. Warden Harley Leppin personally rang through the order for the lethal chemical solutions which will be pumped into McVeigh's veins. Leppin has also determined the last words McVeigh will hear. An official will check the Velcro straps and the intravenous line before stepping back and saying, 'We are ready' - the signal to a volunteer hidden behind a screen to send the drugs on their deadly journey to paralyse McVeigh's heart.</p> <p>Prisoner 12076-064 is making his own plans. He has chosen the witnesses he wants by his side. He has taken enormous care choosing his last words, but is still mulling over his last meal.</p> <p>Oblivious to the desert climate outside in his air-conditioned 8ft by 10ft cell, McVeigh devours every line written about him and causes close to him, and watches television news programmes endlessly. He subscribes to hundreds of publications, from the right-wing Patriot Report and The Spotlight to gun and car magazines and basketball magazines. McVeigh's team is the Buffalo Bulls, and even during intensive interviews, he has been known to quickly switch the conversation round to their latest successes.</p> <p>Basketball is a big game in his native New York State, and Bulls pennants still hang in his old room at the small McVeigh home in the sprawling rural town of Pendleton. When I visited, there was quite a crowd of locals escaping the blizzard outside in a stone-and-timber shack diner just half a mile from where McVeigh's father Bill still lives. The deceptively named Brauer Cocktail Bar and Inn is lively with beer-bellied men in greasy baseball caps who immediately fall from their bar stools to offer the 'lady a seat'. The winner buys me a beer.</p> <p>They are used to talking about McVeigh round here, but prefer to discuss their own shooting prowess or rant about crippling government taxes. Bill Kelly, 58, talks of rising crime: 'Better be paranoid than a victim,' he says slapping his shoulder holster. 'I was in the army, too. Sure, they teach you to kill and, sure, the government would make me wanna kill someone sometimes, but there is no excuse for killing all them people, no way.'</p> <p>The baseball caps nod. 'He's flaky and I don't believe that he's got such a good family because that boy had no discipline, had no respect,' chips in the bartender.</p> <p>When I leave someone grabs my hand and asks my name. I tell him and the bar falls silent: 'Holy shit!' says Kelly. The McVeigh name is not a common one in the US.</p> <p>It is odd chasing the story of a man sharing my family name, my Irish roots and even the blue eyes which is my family characteristic. But then I join the struggle endured by hundreds of Americans who have spent six years trying to come to terms with why their relatives died on a bright spring day that should have been like any other.</p> <p>Only now, four years after the trial, is the full extent of what McVeigh intended becoming clear when, on 19 April 1995, he parked a rental truck filled with 4,800lb of homemade explosives outside a nine-storey building. McVeigh killed 168 people in Oklahoma City that day. Nineteen of them were young children, whose lives he referred to as 'collateral damage'. He wanted a federal target, and the Alfred P Murrah building not only had a Secret Service office but also an office housing agents of his truest enemy - the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Oklahoma City was also where Bob Ricks was based. It was Ricks who had been in charge at Waco, the scene of a botched raid by BATF on 19 April 1993 which resulted in the deaths of 60 men, women and children, followers of David Koresh's Branch Davidian cult.</p> <p>The storming of Waco outraged McVeigh, and together with two like-minded army buddies, Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier, he was looking for a way to make his anger felt and to encourage, he hoped, a right-wing uprising. He chose the second anniversary of Waco as the date.</p> <p>For a blueprint for the attack, McVeigh had a book. The Turner Diaries is a fantasy of hate about a bombing of a Washington federal building in which 800 people die. The fictional blast is justified in detail: 'The real value of all our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties,' it reads.</p> <p>Today the author, William Pierce, backs his most notorious fan: 'I intended people to be inspired,' he says, adding that he did not regret what happened in Oklahoma. 'McVeigh was reacting to what he saw as tyrannical behaviour by the government. In a society that alienates people and makes them feel they no longer have a role,' Pierce adds.</p> <p>McVeigh wavered over taking 'civilian' - or non-government-employed - lives. He switched his target from a larger government office block to the Alfred P Murrah building because, he claims, he saw a florist shop on the first floor. He insists he never, in four visits, spotted the daycare centre on the same floor. And the man whose only emotion during his trial was when he wept over his lawyer's description of the deaths of children at Waco declares that if he had, he would have changed his target.</p> <p>Now awaiting death, McVeigh says he is unafraid, that he doesn't believe in heaven and hell. 'If I'm wrong then I'll adapt, improvise and overcome,' he says. 'But if there is a hell, then I'll be in good company with a lot of fighter pilots who also had to bomb innocents to win the war.'</p> <p>In the weeks before his execution, McVeigh's first admission of guilt has been forthcoming, as has his claim that he deliberately set out to be caught. Much has been made of the fact that within 80 minutes of the bomb exploding, McVeigh was picked up for a traffic violation by State Trooper Charlie Hanger, who had no idea that a building had just been destroyed some miles away. On the passenger seat of McVeigh's car was a big folder stuffed with right-wing literature. He hoped this would be released to the media and his political message would get out immediately, but Hanger left the envelope and took him in on charges of carrying a concealed weapon. It was to be three days before the FBI realised the man they were looking for was sitting in a county jail just a few miles from where rescue workers were still pulling bodies from the wreckage.</p> <p>Those who had encouraged him in his plot, Fortier and Nichols, were safely at home with their respective alibis. A fourth man whom some witnesses claimed to have seen in the city with McVeigh has never been traced and the FBI says it is confident he does not exist. The truth will never be known, because McVeigh wants full credit for the detonation even if he admits Nichols helped build the oil-and-fertiliser bomb and Fortier helped him case the building.</p> <p>'McVeigh deliberately drove his getaway car away from the scene of the blast with no licence plate,' says Lou Michel, one of two newspaper reporters who have conducted exhaustive interviews for their book, An American Terrorist , published in the States last week by Regan Books. 'He had really hoped for a shootout with the FBI,' Michel says. 'For Tim, dying is part of the adventure. He's had a death wish for a long time now and, although he rejects this idea, he wants to become a martyr to right-wing causes.'</p> <p>It has always puzzled investigators why McVeigh would leave such a trail behind him, including using his own name at a motel the night before the blast and using the same card when ordering the fertiliser and fuel. 'I have never caught Tim out on a lie,' insists Michel. 'Strange as that may sound, he is very proud of what he has done. Talking of it, he has the enthusiasm of a high-school kid describing a science project he has just completed.' Michel quotes McVeigh as telling him: 'Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah building and isn't it kind of scary that one man could reap this kind of hell?'</p> <p>What McVeigh is not keen to talk about is his family. He comes from good, solid pioneer stock. His forefather, Edward McVeigh, left Portadown, Northern Ireland, for the New World in 1866 and earned a reputation as a stockman in Niagara County, a short drive from where the family now lives. Another McVeigh left Portadown around the same time - my own ancestor - this time for Scotland. But as the family divided, its ethics of hard work and the importance of family stuck.</p> <p>McVeigh's father Bill was a manual worker for Harrisons - a General Motors-owned firm and the biggest employer in the area - for 37 years before his retirement a few years back. His own father had worked there and got him the job.</p> <p>McVeigh's dad has much in common with my own. A working family-man whose quiet intelligence and good humour gives him a certain dignity. What Bill wanted he worked for, taking overtime and nightshifts to raise extra cash for his growing family. American workplaces allow employees little time off, and with his vivacious wife Mildred 'Mickey' Hill often away from home pursuing her own career as a travel agent, the pair had little time together. It was often a struggle to make sure one was there for their three children, Patty, Tim and Jennifer. Locals talk of Mickey's rov ing eye at the bowling alley she frequented while friends say she was 'excitable'.</p> <p>After McVeigh's arrest, she wrote a letter to the media distancing herself from her son, but later stood up for him in court and visited him in prison. She is now having treatment for mental-health problems.</p> <p>But back in 1978, Mickey left Tim and his father, taking the two girls to a new life in Florida. Tim, a bullied, scrawny 10-year-old who found it hard to make friends, stayed. Father and son had to leave the family's four-bedroom gingerbread-coloured home piped with white trim. The new house, where Bill still lives, is barely as big as the three-door garages which stand next to the houses around here, but the pair dug in a full-sized flagpole and the stars and stripes fluttered high.</p> <p>Bill is a tall man, quiet and polite, who has determinedly carried on his life as before his son's arrest. His friends and his priest all agree that he's a 'good man'. He takes his neighbours baskets of fruit and vegetables. He helps out at charity bingo games and he loves his son.</p> <p>'What he did was a terrible, unimaginable thing, what he did was absolutely wrong, and I don't understand it or know how anyone could do it, but I love my son,' he says. Clearing the snow from his driveway, he falters on more searching questions; he's still looking for answers of his own. This is, after all, a man who fretted about the fact he could not mow his lawn while he confined to his house by the FBI for 10 days after the bombing.</p> <p>One neighbour tells me: 'We stick up for Bill. It was shocking to hear the Oklahoma City bomber was one of our own, but as I said to Bill, we don't choose our children and we don't make 'em what they are.'</p> <p>Joel Daniels served as a solicitor to McVeigh's younger sister Jennifer when the FBI forced her to testify against her brother - the siblings had exchanged many letters detailing the right-wing views they shared. 'The bombing greatly upset this country,' Daniels says. 'I was upset myself - I was shocked when I heard this was a boy from my home town. This was homegrown, and that was the worst by far. But I don't think his growing up here had anything to do with it at all. I wouldn't describe this as a hotbed of radical right-wing politics. I like Jennifer and Bill very much, and I know they felt very badly for those people. They are distraught at the death penalty being imposed.'</p> <p>Bill will honour his son's request not to attend the execution and may go to church on 16 May. 'Bill isn't too good at communicating his feelings,' says his friend, Father Paul Belzer of the Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Tonawanda Creek Road. 'He is a thick-skinned man in many ways. No one knows what happened to Tim, but it certainly didn't come from his family. When he went into the army was surely where the damage was done. This was a normal boy we had here. He liked playing basketball, he came to church picnics.'</p> <p>'The army was a right-wing finishing school for Tim,' agrees Lou Michel. 'They taught him to separate his emotions from his actions and the motto Tim remembers was: \"Blood makes the grass grow greener.\" After the Gulf War, he really became indifferent to life. This is the man who told me: \"I understand what they felt in Oklahoma City. I have no sympathy for them.\"'</p> <p>Lack of remorse is unfathomable for the victims' relatives and the survivors in Oklahoma City who have pinned their efforts on the capital punishment for McVeigh leading to 'closure' for their own grief. Almost 300 have asked to be present at the execution, although only a handful can be accommo dated. The names will be picked out of a hat and the remainder will watch on closed- circuit television in another room.</p> <p>Bud Welch, whose 27-year-old daughter Julie died in the Alfred P Murrah building, will be there although his vocal opposition to capital punishment has set him apart from the majority of relatives who have campaigned hard and emotively to speed up the appeals process to ensure McVeigh's death comes sooner rather than later.</p> <p>'I will be there, but I won't be waving any placard. The death of this man will be a private moment for me, and a very sad one. I don't think his death is going to help anyone or bring anyone back. If we accept state killing, we accept killing,' he says.</p> <p>But in Oklahoma City there will be flag waving and even a few parties. After all, this is the city that flew in the jury that condemned McVeigh to death and paid for their VIP tour as a show of thanks.</p> <p>Last month, President Bush came here to officially open the new Memorial Center at the site where the Alfred P Murrah building once stood. The content of the museum is heavy with religious music and iconography as suits an overwhelmingly Christian community, though among the exhibits of rubble, bloodied clothing and other relics is a platform given to the political fight to speed up McVeigh's execution. The overall sentiment gets somewhat lost as the huge queues of candy-munching tourists file in, and it is hard to gain a sense of the true tragedy that occurred here. It is only outside in the spring sunshine that one can gaze at the buildings around and try to imagine what it must have been like when hell ripped this community apart and orphaned 200 children.</p> <p>The people here are overwhelmingly hospitable and too polite to look askance at my name. Even Jennifer McVeigh's solicitor Joel Daniels tells how, when they came to Oklahoma City to a courtroom whose windows were blown out by the blast, they were treated with utmost courtesy. 'The hospitality was unflagging, even though everyone knew exactly who we were,' he says.</p> <p>But this is also a community that wants McVeigh's head and now also wants the life of at least one of the other two men implicated in the bombing: the state is about to spend an estimated $5m (\u00a33.5m) on trying to get the life sentence of Terry Nichols upped to death. Nichols was convicted of conspiring in the bombing in 1998 in a federal trial. But despite a guarantee that he will never leave jail, Oklahoma is going ahead with a second trial later this year to try to have him executed. The third man involved, Michael Fortier, received 14 years after striking an immunity deal with the FBI to give evidence against McVeigh.</p> <p>McVeigh has a huge stack of mail to get through. Along with the hate mail, he has had at least four proposals of marriage - not bad for a man who showed little interest in women. By some perverse twist, the US federal authorities make a condemned prisoner's last three days his most isolated. Without distraction, it is hoped, the prisoner will reflect on his crimes and finally give America what it craves - repentance.</p> <p>Just last month, a born-again Christian trucker sparked a security alert when he drove into the prison compound unchallenged. 'I've just found Jesus and I wanted to give McVeigh a Bible so he could find him, too,' he explained.</p> <p>Terre Haute prison is gearing up for further security alerts on 16 May. Schools are closed for the day, the skies will be dotted with police and media helicopters, and there have been estimates of 2,000 news-reporting personnel.</p> <p>In Oklahoma City, the long winter is over and spring is already here, the air is warm and green shoots are showing in the wide street verges. Just a 24 hours' drive north in Pendleton, New York, a father sits in his armchair and looks past the television set out of the window to his beloved garden, where the snow is starting to shrink back and where a pole which once flew the American flag now rusts. And Bill McVeigh waits for the thaw.</p> <p><b>The final countdown: How the Oklahoma bomber will die</b></p> <p>Two weeks before 16 May, the executioners and the tie-down team - all prison staff volunteers - will begin practising.</p> <p>Three days before, McVeigh will be shackled and leave death row for a bare, brick holding cell in an adjoining building, just a few yards from the specially built execution chamber. Reading and writing materials, his television and photographs will be taken away.</p> <p>Three hours to go, and prison officers will check equipment while Rob Nigh, McVeigh's lawyer, visits him.</p> <p>Thirty minutes to go. McVeigh's cell door will open and an escort of six will strip-search him, then lead him to the chamber where, behind a shield, 24 witnesses, media, victims' relatives and government officials are seated.</p> <p>The table will tip, McVeigh will be 'helped' to lie back and thick Velcro straps will bind his head, neck, chest, waist and legs. Each arm is secured by five straps.</p> <p>A needle will be swiftly inserted into his arm and the witness shield will be raised. McVeigh will get to say his last words and the warden will then read the death warrant, ending with the words: 'We are ready.'</p> <p>Behind a screen, one of three technicians will depress a plunger. A solution of sodium penthothal and Pavulon will hit McVeigh's veins to paralyse him so he will be unable to show pain as his lungs collapse. Then comes a shot of potassium chloride to squeeze his heart. Death should occur within five minutes.</p>",

It was shocking to hear the Oklahoma City bomber was one of our own, but as I said to Bill, we don't choose our children and we don't make 'em what they are.' Joel Daniels served as a solicitor to McVeigh's younger sister Jennifer when the FBI forced her to testify against her brother - the siblings had exchanged many letters detailing the right-wing views they shared. 'The bombing greatly upset this country,' Daniels says. 'I was upset myself - I was shocked when I heard this was a boy from my home town. This was homegrown, and that was the worst by far. But I don't think his growing up here had anything to do with it at all. I wouldn't describe this as a hotbed of radical right-wing politics. I like Jennifer and Bill very much, and I know they felt very badly for those people. They are distraught at the death penalty being imposed.' Bill will honour his son's request not to attend the execution and may go to church on 16 May. 'Bill isn't too good at communicating his feelings,' says his friend, Father Paul Belzer of the Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Tonawanda Creek Road. 'He is a thick-skinned man in many ways. No one knows what happened to Tim, but it certainly didn't come from his family. When he went into the army was surely where the damage was done. This was a normal boy we had here. He liked playing basketball, he came to church picnics.' 'The army was a right-wing finishing school for Tim,' agrees Lou Michel. 'They taught him to separate his emotions from his actions and the motto Tim remembers was: \"Blood makes the grass grow greener.\" After the Gulf War, he really became indifferent to life. This is the man who told me: \"I understand what they felt in Oklahoma City. I have no sympathy for them.\"' Lack of remorse is unfathomable for the victims' relatives and the survivors in Oklahoma City who have pinned their efforts on the capital punishment for McVeigh leading to 'closure' for their own grief. Almost 300 have asked to be present at the execution, although only a handful can be accommo dated. The names will be picked out of a hat and the remainder will watch on closed- circuit television in another room. Bud Welch, whose 27-year-old daughter Julie died in the Alfred P Murrah building, will be there although his vocal opposition to capital punishment has set him apart from the majority of relatives who have campaigned hard and emotively to speed up the appeals process to ensure McVeigh's death comes sooner rather than later. 'I will be there, but I won't be waving any placard. The death of this man will be a private moment for me, and a very sad one. I don't think his death is going to help anyone or bring anyone back. If we accept state killing, we accept killing,' he says. But in Oklahoma City there will be flag waving and even a few parties. After all, this is the city that flew in the jury that condemned McVeigh to death and paid for their VIP tour as a show of thanks. Last month, President Bush came here to officially open the new Memorial Center at the site where the Alfred P Murrah building once stood. The content of the museum is heavy with religious music and iconography as suits an overwhelmingly Christian community, though among the exhibits of rubble, bloodied clothing and other relics is a platform given to the political fight to speed up McVeigh's execution. The overall sentiment gets somewhat lost as the huge queues of candy-munching tourists file in, and it is hard to gain a sense of the true tragedy that occurred here. It is only outside in the spring sunshine that one can gaze at the buildings around and try to imagine what it must have been like when hell ripped this community apart and orphaned 200 children. The people here are overwhelmingly hospitable and too polite to look askance at my name. Even Jennifer McVeigh's solicitor Joel Daniels tells how, when they came to Oklahoma City to a courtroom whose windows were blown out by the blast, they were treated with utmost courtesy. 'The hospitality was unflagging, even though everyone knew exactly who we were,' he says. But this is also a community that wants McVeigh's head and now also wants the life of at least one of the other two men implicated in the bombing: the state is about to spend an estimated $5m (\u00a33.5m) on trying to get the life sentence of Terry Nichols upped to death. Nichols was convicted of conspiring in the bombing in 1998 in a federal trial. But despite a guarantee that he will never leave jail, Oklahoma is going ahead with a second trial later this year to try to have him executed. The third man involved, Michael Fortier, received 14 years after striking an immunity deal with the FBI to give evidence against McVeigh. McVeigh has a huge stack of mail to get through. Along with the hate mail, he has had at least four proposals of marriage - not bad for a man who showed little interest in women. By some perverse twist, the US federal authorities make a condemned prisoner's last three days his most isolated. Without distraction, it is hoped, the prisoner will reflect on his crimes and finally give America what it craves - repentance. Just last month, a born-again Christian trucker sparked a security alert when he drove into the prison compound unchallenged. 'I've just found Jesus and I wanted to give McVeigh a Bible so he could find him, too,' he explained. Terre Haute prison is gearing up for further security alerts on 16 May. Schools are closed for the day, the skies will be dotted with police and media helicopters, and there have been estimates of 2,000 news-reporting personnel. In Oklahoma City, the long winter is over and spring is already here, the air is warm and green shoots are showing in the wide street verges. Just a 24 hours' drive north in Pendleton, New York, a father sits in his armchair and looks past the television set out of the window to his beloved garden, where the snow is starting to shrink back and where a pole which once flew the American flag now rusts. And Bill McVeigh waits for the thaw. The final countdown: How the Oklahoma bomber will die Two weeks before 16 May, the executioners and the tie-down team - all prison staff volunteers - will begin practising. Three days before, McVeigh will be shackled and leave death row for a bare, brick holding cell in an adjoining building, just a few yards from the specially built execution chamber. Reading and writing materials, his television and photographs will be taken away. Three hours to go, and prison officers will check equipment while Rob Nigh, McVeigh's lawyer, visits him. Thirty minutes to go. McVeigh's cell door will open and an escort of six will strip-search him, then lead him to the chamber where, behind a shield, 24 witnesses, media, victims' relatives and government officials are seated. The table will tip, McVeigh will be 'helped' to lie back and thick Velcro straps will bind his head, neck, chest, waist and legs. Each arm is secured by five straps. A needle will be swiftly inserted into his arm and the witness shield will be raised. McVeigh will get to say his last words and the warden will then read the death warrant, ending with the words: 'We are ready.' Behind a screen, one of three technicians will depress a plunger. A solution of sodium penthothal and Pavulon will hit McVeigh's veins to paralyse him so he will be unable to show pain as his lungs collapse. Then comes a shot of potassium chloride to squeeze his heart. Death should occur within five minutes.",

      "bodyText": "A book tour that is more of a crusade by one of America's most popular and mercurial novelists begins this weekend. It is an impassioned plea for the preservation of books and newspapers, of paper and printed text rather than microfilm or computer disk. Nicholson Baker is known for books dealing with time and memory but especially for Vox, a novel featuring phone sex that Monica Lewinsky famously gave to President Bill Clinton as a gift. But now Baker unleashes his life's passion: a diatribe against the wholesale destruction of books and newspapers by the people and institutions assigned to be their guardians - librarians and libraries. The book, Double Fold, has become a rallying cry for protest across the internet. Correspondents to such avowedly non-paper journals as Slate allege a 'paper holocaust' in America and across the world. Signs within America's bibliophile establishment indicate Baker's book has not only sounded the alarm but won the debate. The Washington-based Council of Library and Information Resources issued a draft report this month rescinding decades of received wisdom by recommending a nationwide effort to save original copies of books and newspapers. Baker argues that, over the past few decades, libraries have engaged in a 'slash and burn' purge of irreplaceable literary records and captured moments of history, pulping papers and books - usually transferring them to microfilm or computer disk - because of an erroneous obsession with saving space. Librarians have also argued that the paper used in many books and all newspapers from about the year 1880 will disintegrate - without meticulous care - because the paper is made from 'wood pulp' containing acids that make it turn brittle and yellow. Among the moments of destruction that detonated Baker's rage and propelled his book was the great sell-off and destruction, in 1999, of non-British newspapers by the Colindale branch of the British Library. His book opens with an account of the Luftwaffe's bombing of Colindale which incinerated 'ten thousand volumes of Irish and English newspapers' - sparing, however, 'a very large foreign newspaper collection, including many historic American titles'. 'Bombs spared the American papers,' Baker writes, 'but recent managerial policy has not'. In October that year, the collection was decimated and only a small slice of it survived - that which Baker himself bought for storage in a property he keeps for the purpose near his home in Maine. The other motivation for his anger was a decision by San Francisco library to consign most of its printed newspaper records to a rubbish dump - against which Baker took legal action. And so it is in San Francisco that the book tour begins, and from there that Baker spoke to The Observer last week. It is a soulless library, with an atrium in which no book can be seen. 'I'm always interested in such places that are not what they claim,' says Baker, 'just as I am appalled by places in which books are a mere decoration. Estate agents have taken to placing them on coffee tables during property showings. I always pick them up, and usually they are nailed down.' Baker speaks cogently about his intimacy with books and newspapers: 'I do feel there is something special about opening one of those old British Library volumes; there's enough paper there to disturb the air as it moves, and with it, you move through a day in the life of a city.' Even in response to the ageing of paper, Baker adds: 'I love the fragility too, it's like the discoloured stone of a cathedral; it cries out that it is old, but bore witness.' It was Fyodor Dostoyevsky who pioneered these sentiments, as revealed in revolutionary studies by the recently uncovered critic Mikhail Bakhtin, who found the great writer to have believed in newspapers as the best reconstructions of the 'polyphonic' nature of life itself. But Baker charts a more recent history. In 1944 an influential librarian, Fremont Rider - who had worked at the US Office of Strategic Studies during the Second World War - posited what he called a 'natural law' of library growth, and the need to cull collections of information. The narrative is a thriller in which the cult of micro-filming spreads within the CIA and thence to the archive industry. Many librarians singled out for targeting in what Baker calls a culture of 'destroying to preserve' turn out to have agency track records, or to have remained consultants to the CIA. One review of his book makes a chilling reference to the famous Vietnam adage: 'It was necessary to destroy the village in order to save it.' In his book, Baker argues that paper holds up better than has been commonly assumed; that microfiche is an inadequate substitute; that the craving for space is fallacious - and that wholesale destruction in the name of space-saving is unnecessary in a vast land. He has been challenged on the internet, largely on the Slate site, by correspondents who say he ignores the perishability of paper or exaggerates the 'secret' nature of the programme to pulp and destroy. Baker retorts that tests have proved paper to be more durable than thought, and appeals to the market-sensibility among his critics by saying that in terms of cost, a book costs infinitely less - per cubic foot of storage space - than a microfilm to maintain in a library. Baker has a message to the guardians of the paper heritage in Britain. 'The main thing I would like the British Library to do,' he says, 'is just to reassure people about what went where, so there can be no further doubt. I do actually think that you people have a more sensitive idea about how to preserve books than we do.'",

      "bodyText": "Species of wildlife long thought to have disappeared from our shores are actually alive and well, according to the most comprehensive study into flora and fauna in the last 25 years. The Changing Wildlife of Great Britain and Ireland, the first independent non-governmental overall assessment since 1973, found many species thriving as never before. Surprised researchers discovered that there have been fewer extinctions than previously thought, a rise in the number of new species and a wider distribution of previously identified species than realised. 'The message the study conveys is not as depressing as might have been expected,' said Sir John Burnett, chair of the National Biodiversity Network Trust. 'The last 50 years have seen real progress, and the one cause of real joy must be for the many newly discovered or recognised species, the numbers of which have exceeded all those recorded in previous centuries.' But Professor David Hawksworth, head of the study and former chair of English Nature, warned that the larger picture is still overridingly negative and that the study must not be used as an excuse for complacency. 'Although the number of species that have become extinct in the last quarter-century is not high, the number of species at risk has greatly increased,' he said. 'This study shows that we have been given a second chance to get things right. The common denominator in virtually every change we have seen is human activity - we're the ones in the driving seat and only we can make a difference.'

This man too is an 'escape artist'. </p> <p>These are the twin heroes - if a book of ideas can be said to have heroes - of Adam Phillips's Houdini's Box. The first is the famous escapologist of the book's title; the second is an anonymous patient, who has come to see Phillips (the analyst rather than the author). If Houdini's purpose was to continuously and spectacularly defy death, nowhere was his fear more lucid than when his mother died. 'I who have laughed at the terrors of death,' he wrote of that event, 'who have smilingly leaped from high bridges, received a shock from which I do not think recovery is possible.' </p> <p>And yet, as the man on the couch shows, it is possible to fear life just as much. When the man abruptly ends his analysis it becomes clear to Phillips that they were operating at cross-purposes: while Phillips was encouraging him to embrace possibility, the man wanted to become more decisive, more closed off. 'He wanted me to turn him into a better choice-maker,' Phillips writes, 'I wanted to turn him into a better risk-taker.' The story of Houdini and the story of the analysand illuminate each other. </p> <p>Escape, Phillips suggests, is an end in itself, and more of a foundation myth for our lives than we might suppose. In classical mythology Icarus is so taken with 'the ecstasy of flight', as Phillips puts it, that he forgets where he is going, and succumbs fatally to the flight itself. Even Adam and Eve, in Phillips's interpretation, were part of 'a great escape story; the story of a failed breakout'. </p> <p>'Perhaps one can define the times,' he writes, 'and the individual people who live through them, by their exits... Every modern person has their own repertoire of elsewheres... to make their actual, lived lives more than bearable.'</p> <p>More fond of questions than he is of answers, Phillips often writes in poetic, oracular riddles. Unlike Freud's case histories, Phillips's don't offer much in the way of explanation or diagnosis - they are encounters, fables, exchanges related as if they were scenes in a novel. He will not tell you about men and Mars or women and Venus, because finite conclusions are foreign to his method. There must always be an escape clause, as it were, for ideas; minds must be allowed to change. </p> <p>Every story Phillips tells, from the detailed analytical sessions to the one-line epigraphs, is a parable of some sort - it stands for something, becomes a cryptic guide to life. In The Beast in the Nursery he began with a wonderfully puzzling quote from Kafka. Here he offers Wittgenstein: 'The way to solve the problem you see in life is to live in a way that makes the problem disappear.' From the man who brought us a drawing that could either be a duck or a rabbit, depending on which way you looked at it, comes this double meaning. How can you make the problem disappear? By solving it or by ignoring it? Living in the way Wittgenstein suggests could either mean confronting the problem or the opposite, skirting around it - the problem 'disappears' only because you cannot see it. </p> <p>Wittgenstein's riddle is a perfect introduction to Phillips's project, and his idiom. The epigraph seems to be about psychoanalysis, how people's imaginations work and what they hide from themselves, and it comes from a philosopher. Houdini's Box, like many of Phillips's essays, begins like a detective story, offering clues to the varying patterns of minds, and ends up, unsolved, as a scattered philosophy. </p> <p>As in the writings of Kafka, Walter Benjamin or the stories within stories of Milan Kundera, Phillips's wisdom comes at you from unexpected corners. Phrases you read some time ago seem to mean something different on rereading, and the most profound statements are often embedded in a tiny subclause: 'I felt much freer to speak my so-called mind,' Phillips writes at one point; earlier he describes the impatience of a young girl's parents as 'verging on indifference, as impatience always does'. Suddenly you are struck by this throwaway truth, or possibility: that, if they were left to get impatient enough, the girl's parents would stop caring what happened to her. </p> <p>Though Phillips's territory is complication, he reports back from his travels in the simplest of words. He is perhaps single-handedly continuing the tradition of the world's best essayists, yet there is nothing arch or highfalutin about his writing.

After that announcement, as Icke issued more and more apocalyptic warnings, pausing only to inform Terry Wogan and a national television audience that he was indeed 'the son of God', the former BBC sports presenter became the most ridiculed man in the country, a national joke. </p> <p>Since then Icke has been working restlessly to reinvent himself as a 'New Age' thinker, a fearless pursuer of truth and batty believer that the world is ruled by a global cabal called the 'Illumaniti', descended from extraterrestrials, who long ago assumed human form and infiltrated some of the world's \u00e9lite families, including the Bushes and the Windsors (which perhaps explains the plight of poor old Sophie Wessex). Icke has become the kind of person Jon Ronson, scourge of fanatics and extremists everywhere, would like as a prime exhibit in his human zoo. Sure enough he turns up here in Ronson's new book, along with gun-toting American wackos, Islamic fundamentalists, white supremacists and conspiracy theorists - a fearful gallery of grotesques!</p> <p>What unites Ronson's interviewees or 'extremists', apart from their marginal position in society, is their belief that history itself is a vast conspiracy, propelled by covert forces of incomparable stealth and power. And what no doubt attracts Ronson to them is not so much what their fanaticism says about the effects a God-shaped hole is having on our lives but its boundless capacity to amuse, especially when contrasted with his own proud worldliness, his smooth tolerance. </p> <p>But how tolerant is he? The journalist and television critic Andrew Billen has accused Ronson of trading in 'observational cynicism', and this book is nothing if not cynical, in a modish, exaggeratedly straight-faced kind of way. Ronson never once conceives of his victims as being ends in themselves, with their own small narratives of struggle and poignant humanity, but as a means to an end - namely that of an easy joke. And these people are victims because they are merely introduced, questioned until they expose the depth of their delusions and then whimsically dispatched, like contestants on a game show, with Ronson operating as a smiling Alan Whicker of extremism, travelling the world in search of ever more dangerous fanatics. </p> <p>Except that, on the whole, the people he encounters - Omar Mohammed, a 'semi-detached Ayatollah' scheming to start a holy war in England from the basement of his London flat, or a white supremacist seeking to modernise the Ku Klux Klan - aren't so much extremists as lonely solitaries, unhappily lost in the world (one white supremacist claims to have survived 16 attempts on his life, all drive-by shootings). Perhaps the only person truly deserving of Ronson's scorn is Dr Ian Paisley, whom he follows on a proselytising mission to Cameroon in the best section of the book, and who is suspiciously alert to any potential slight. </p> <p>Ronson is not a stylish writer. There is not a single arresting phrase in this entire book. Rather, Them, published without an index or bibliography, reads more like a hastily edited transcript: long pages of bland dialogue, punctuated by the occasional waggish aside. His technique is simple. Ronson operates as a camera (indeed you sense that he is never without, if not a camera, then a cameraman alongside him), a candid one, monitoring his prey at play, blithely waiting for them to expose and humiliate themselves. But Ronson is neither as funny nor as smart as he thinks he is. Rather, like Louis Theroux, his fellow television documentarian, he emerges from this study as a self-celebrating ironist, adept at a peculiar kind of contemporary cruelty. </p> <p>In a recent article in the Daily Telegraph, Theroux wrote of how he was attracted to eccentrics, 'people with a kind of blindness about themselves and their place in the world'. The implicit suggestion here is that Theroux himself suffers from no such deficiencies: he is sure of himself and his place in the world all right, too sure - and how it shows in his work, which, like Ronson's, is characterised by a fatal knowingness of tone and style, by a desire to create the modern televisual equivalent of the fairground freak show, with eccentrics lining up to play the part of the bearded lady. </p> <p>And yet this book could have been more accomplished - because Ronson in his quest for gags has stumbled on a compelling subject: that of the strange ways in which many of us, alienated by the reductionism of hard science and lost without belief, are struggling to adapt to a time of nihilism, when all utopian schemes to remake the world have been seen to fail. </p> <p>There is a telling exchange early in the book. Ronson has followed Icke to Vancouver for a speaking tour. But local activists accuse Icke of anti-Semitism and he is banned from speaking on several radio programmes. He feels that he is a victim of a conspiracy and complains of how 'easy it is to get vast numbers of people to believe anything' - in this case, that Icke is dangerous and should be censored. Ronson lets the remark pass without comment, so eager is he to confess his complicity in a failed attempt to have Icke spattered with a custard pie. </p> <p>But Icke's remark is worth taking seriously, because he has arrived at a difficult truth, one which unwittingly recalls Chesterton's observation that when a man stops believing in God, he doesn't then believe in nothing; he believes in everything - in anything. As for Ronson, you close his book convinced that he does not so much believe in anything as nothing at all - except for his own metropolitan prejudice.</p>",

And these people are victims because they are merely introduced, questioned until they expose the depth of their delusions and then whimsically dispatched, like contestants on a game show, with Ronson operating as a smiling Alan Whicker of extremism, travelling the world in search of ever more dangerous fanatics. Except that, on the whole, the people he encounters - Omar Mohammed, a 'semi-detached Ayatollah' scheming to start a holy war in England from the basement of his London flat, or a white supremacist seeking to modernise the Ku Klux Klan - aren't so much extremists as lonely solitaries, unhappily lost in the world (one white supremacist claims to have survived 16 attempts on his life, all drive-by shootings). Perhaps the only person truly deserving of Ronson's scorn is Dr Ian Paisley, whom he follows on a proselytising mission to Cameroon in the best section of the book, and who is suspiciously alert to any potential slight. Ronson is not a stylish writer. There is not a single arresting phrase in this entire book. Rather, Them, published without an index or bibliography, reads more like a hastily edited transcript: long pages of bland dialogue, punctuated by the occasional waggish aside. His technique is simple. Ronson operates as a camera (indeed you sense that he is never without, if not a camera, then a cameraman alongside him), a candid one, monitoring his prey at play, blithely waiting for them to expose and humiliate themselves. But Ronson is neither as funny nor as smart as he thinks he is. Rather, like Louis Theroux, his fellow television documentarian, he emerges from this study as a self-celebrating ironist, adept at a peculiar kind of contemporary cruelty. In a recent article in the Daily Telegraph, Theroux wrote of how he was attracted to eccentrics, 'people with a kind of blindness about themselves and their place in the world'. The implicit suggestion here is that Theroux himself suffers from no such deficiencies: he is sure of himself and his place in the world all right, too sure - and how it shows in his work, which, like Ronson's, is characterised by a fatal knowingness of tone and style, by a desire to create the modern televisual equivalent of the fairground freak show, with eccentrics lining up to play the part of the bearded lady. And yet this book could have been more accomplished - because Ronson in his quest for gags has stumbled on a compelling subject: that of the strange ways in which many of us, alienated by the reductionism of hard science and lost without belief, are struggling to adapt to a time of nihilism, when all utopian schemes to remake the world have been seen to fail. There is a telling exchange early in the book. Ronson has followed Icke to Vancouver for a speaking tour. But local activists accuse Icke of anti-Semitism and he is banned from speaking on several radio programmes. He feels that he is a victim of a conspiracy and complains of how 'easy it is to get vast numbers of people to believe anything' - in this case, that Icke is dangerous and should be censored. Ronson lets the remark pass without comment, so eager is he to confess his complicity in a failed attempt to have Icke spattered with a custard pie. But Icke's remark is worth taking seriously, because he has arrived at a difficult truth, one which unwittingly recalls Chesterton's observation that when a man stops believing in God, he doesn't then believe in nothing; he believes in everything - in anything. As for Ronson, you close his book convinced that he does not so much believe in anything as nothing at all - except for his own metropolitan prejudice.",

Visited schools, shook hands with headmistresses, soaked up the atmosphere and scrutinised everything, from the faces of the pupils to the coat pegs. I read Ofsted reports and league tables. Confronted with the parental preference form I filled in three carefully researched choices of school that seemed closest to what I wanted for my three-year-old in starting his journey through the education machine. This month, my local education authority, Brighton and Hove Council, told me none of my preferences could be accommodated. My son has been given a place at a school three miles from our home - there are six closer schools - which has an Ofsted report that makes my heart sink. It rates 'well below satisfactory' on children's achievements in reading and writing. If the school is not getting the basics of literacy right what is it doing? And what does this mean? It is in a far-from-affluent housing estate but does not have a high percentage of children with special needs which might affect its scores. If there are children particularly difficult to teach will that mean my relatively bright son will be ignored? The report is dated from 1999; are things better or worse now? A visit does not help - what head is going to say: 'Yes, this is a terrible school, I just can't get the staff, we have no parental input, the governors are just ambitious councillors who want to have an extra string to their bow on paper and frankly I'm just hanging on till retirement.' Appeal to a popular, oversubscribed school and immediately there is the brick wall of the Government's statutory class sizes - no more than 30. Parental choice? This is a parental con. LEAs across the country are in the process of being inundated with appeals. The number of appeals are expected to be more than double the 1998 total of 53,400 which was in turn 4 per cent up on 1997 with 38 per cent proving successful. Our first choice was a school where some of my son's friends from nursery school have places and in which other friends already attend. The school is within walking distance, a boon for his health, for the health of other children who will have one less car at the school gates encouraging the rising asthma rates, and for the council which actively backs the Government's policy of trying to end the environmental problems of the school car run. The closest school is a few minutes' walk but it is a Church of England school and as an atheist they don't want me, nor am I keen on school time being taken up by spiritual indoctrination. Conditioned to believe that education, education, education, is what it is all about, now we have expectation, expectation, expectation. We have agreed to pay the taxes, are happy to see the money being ploughed in to schools but we are also deeply selfish when it comes to our own. No parent wants their child to go in at the sharp end in an improving school rather than at the comfortable end in an already achieving school. Secretary of State for Education David Blunkett may dismiss such concerns as middle-class angst but everything is in place to encourage parents from all walks of life to believe that a good school equals success, fulfilment and achieving true potential. A bad school equals failure, unhappiness, bullying, poor teaching and, no doubt, glue-sniffing. Guilt, worry and trepidation is already a parental lot and the muddle that is schools admissions does little to alleviate that.

The Trust gave me access on what had become a very complicated case. It knew exactly what to expect in my final report. Mrs Brett had been wrongly diagnosed. She was forced to go down a route which has caused her and her family a huge amount of stress. Sadly, her case is not an isolated one.'</p> <p>The NHS complaints procedure has become notorious for its inability to deliver adequate redress.

The report has been repeatedly delayed. Critics, such as Arnold Simanowitz of Action for Victims of Medical Accidents, are concerned its proposals will continue to leave too much power in the hands of medical and managerial professionals. 'The cost to individuals and to public confidence in the NHS will be huge,' said Simanowitz.</p> <p>Jean Brett's case is a reminder that the solitary patient continues to face enormous difficulties in achieving justice.</p> <p>In 1985, Mrs Brett, from Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, visited an optician, Anthony Gasson, for new glasses. He advised her to see an opthalmologist and suggested Roger Pearce. Unusually, Gasson referred her directly without going through her GP. She visited Pearce privately to avoid NHS delays.</p> <p>In November 1988, when Pearce suggested her right eye required an operation, Mrs Brett said she would prefer to become an NHS patient and seek a second opinion. She was admitted to Watford General but did not see another consultant. Pearce performed the operation in March 1989. Before surgery, a registrar conducted a single set of tests, diagnosing glaucoma. Mrs Brett should have received three sets of tests.</p> <p>Three years later, in 1992, she decided to stop using Pilocarpine, eye drops prescribed by Pearce. She had suffered from debilitating headaches and conjunctivitis. Pearce told staff that she would go blind without medication. He also advised a second operation on her left eye. Eight months later, Jean Brett learnt from a consultant at Moorfields that she had never had glaucoma. She demanded answers.</p> <p>Dominic Wright, the Trust's surgical care manager asked her to complain formally so the hospital could investigate. She was told the procedure would take two months. In June 1993, the Trust instructed her to seek legal advice.</p> <p>Reluctantly, she consulted solicitors. They told her the legal route would be costly, difficult and there was a strong chance she would be 'timed out' - failing to reach a conclusion within three years. She said: 'I decided it was the principle that mattered so I cashed in some policies. I was anxious that others, who also might have been misdiagnosed with glaucoma, would never learn the truth unless there was a review of Pearce's cases.'</p> <p>The Glick Report shows how the months disappeared in a way common to many complaints. In a taped interview, Pearce admitted that his report on the case, dated 29 November 1992, had not in fact been given to the Trust until 1995, when Mrs Brett- now \u00a330,000 poorer - was duly timed out. 'Had I not kept meticulous records, I would have been made out to be a stranger to the truth by Stephen Ramsden [the Trust's then chief executive of the Trust] who already had a tremendous psychological and practical advantage over me because of his position and the fact that he did not have to pay his own solicitor's bills. If it has been difficult for me, what it must it be like for those who are old or poorer or less able to cope?' said Mrs Brett.</p> <p>In April 1996, the present NHS complaints procedure was introduced. It established three steps - local resolution; an independent review panel (IRP) and, finally, referral to the Ombudsman. Mrs Brett applied for an IRP in which the panel would receive evidence; ask questions and issue a report containing facts and recommendations.</p> <p>A panel was eventually set up in July 1996 to examine the case. Its convener, Lady Mary Auld, was also a non-executive director of West Herts Trust. After it reported, Mrs Brett rejected the findings on the grounds that it had evaded the main grievance of mistreatment.</p> <p>The Health Service Ombudsman upheld the charge and asked the panel to make clear its findings. He also declared much of the case out of time, since he is only able to consider clinical cases after 1996. Undaunted, Jean Brett continued her quest for the truth.</p> <p>Finally, in 1998, five years after her original complaint, the Trust's chief executive admitted in a letter that it was 'a matter of regret' that she had been both misdiagnosed and mistreated. There was no explanation, no apology, no compensation and no review of her consultant's past cases. After pressure from Mrs Brett's MP, Richard Page, the Trust's new chief executive Stephen Eames appointed Glick as a conciliator. Her report was scathing. She said she found it 'beyond comprehension' that the panel had failed to record that Pearce had operated on a healthy eye. Glick declared it 'astounding' that the panel 'did not feel Watford General Hospital had been ineffective'.</p> <p>Glick recommended the Trust enter into discussions with Mrs Brett, offer compensation, make an unconditional apology and undertake an audit of its ophthalmic department including a review of Pearce's past cases.</p> <p>Six weeks later, Eames wrote to Mrs Brett offering \u00a33,500 compensation and an apology which was 'conditional on drawing the matter to a complete close'. It also emerged that an 'independent' audit of practice within the Ophthalmology Department would be managed by the Trust's medical director.</p> <p>Contrary to the directions of Glick's report, the audit only examined the case notes of patients over a period of six months from July 1999. It did not review their original diagnoses. Mrs Brett replied to Eames a week later rejecting the terms and, two years on, is still waiting to hear back. The Trust says it has endeavoured to resolve her complaint and that the audit, which revealed no major irregularities, was conducted according to NHS guidelines. Roger Pearce declined to comment.</p> <p>Last month, the scale of mistakes within the NHS was indicated by a pilot study in two London hospitals. Extrapolated nationally, 850,000 patients may be victims of error - 70,000 fatal - at a cost to the NHS of \u00a32 billion a year. Some Trusts have become highly proactive, investing in risk management and abandoning strategies based on defensiveness.</p> <p>Research indicates that only a fraction of medical errors work their way effectively through the present complaints procedure. It also indicates that most patients who have a grievance want a 'soft' resolution - an apology and an assurance that other patients will be better protected.</p> <p>The Health and Social Care Bill proposes that complaints first be dealt with at a local level by a Patient Advocacy and Liaison Service (Pals), employed by Trusts and far from independent. Autonomous Community Health Councils, which frequently offer advice and support to patients, will be abolished in England; Independent Patient Advocates, vague in detail, will take their place.</p> <p>David Hinchliffe is far from satisfied. 'It is putting the cart before the horse to alter the existing complaints mechanism before the publication of the Government's evaluation of the system. It also makes a nonsense of the period of consultation which it has promised will follow its own recommendations.'</p> <p>Susan Polywka of the Clinical Disputes Forum - lawyers, doctors and academics involved in medical negligence issues - which has produced its own suggestions for reforms - said: 'What's required is a simple one-stop shop - an accountable, independent, speedy process in the form of a tribunal, which can bring together investigation and compensation matters.'</p> <p>For Jean Brett, the options are exhausted. 'Decent people within the NHS have risked their jobs to give me information. It is to maintain that ethos and for the sake of other patients that, even after nine years, I have no choice but to fight on.'</p>",

'Had I not kept meticulous records, I would have been made out to be a stranger to the truth by Stephen Ramsden [the Trust's then chief executive of the Trust] who already had a tremendous psychological and practical advantage over me because of his position and the fact that he did not have to pay his own solicitor's bills. If it has been difficult for me, what it must it be like for those who are old or poorer or less able to cope?' said Mrs Brett. In April 1996, the present NHS complaints procedure was introduced. It established three steps - local resolution; an independent review panel (IRP) and, finally, referral to the Ombudsman. Mrs Brett applied for an IRP in which the panel would receive evidence; ask questions and issue a report containing facts and recommendations. A panel was eventually set up in July 1996 to examine the case. Its convener, Lady Mary Auld, was also a non-executive director of West Herts Trust. After it reported, Mrs Brett rejected the findings on the grounds that it had evaded the main grievance of mistreatment. The Health Service Ombudsman upheld the charge and asked the panel to make clear its findings. He also declared much of the case out of time, since he is only able to consider clinical cases after 1996. Undaunted, Jean Brett continued her quest for the truth. Finally, in 1998, five years after her original complaint, the Trust's chief executive admitted in a letter that it was 'a matter of regret' that she had been both misdiagnosed and mistreated. There was no explanation, no apology, no compensation and no review of her consultant's past cases. After pressure from Mrs Brett's MP, Richard Page, the Trust's new chief executive Stephen Eames appointed Glick as a conciliator. Her report was scathing. She said she found it 'beyond comprehension' that the panel had failed to record that Pearce had operated on a healthy eye. Glick declared it 'astounding' that the panel 'did not feel Watford General Hospital had been ineffective'. Glick recommended the Trust enter into discussions with Mrs Brett, offer compensation, make an unconditional apology and undertake an audit of its ophthalmic department including a review of Pearce's past cases. Six weeks later, Eames wrote to Mrs Brett offering \u00a33,500 compensation and an apology which was 'conditional on drawing the matter to a complete close'. It also emerged that an 'independent' audit of practice within the Ophthalmology Department would be managed by the Trust's medical director. Contrary to the directions of Glick's report, the audit only examined the case notes of patients over a period of six months from July 1999. It did not review their original diagnoses. Mrs Brett replied to Eames a week later rejecting the terms and, two years on, is still waiting to hear back. The Trust says it has endeavoured to resolve her complaint and that the audit, which revealed no major irregularities, was conducted according to NHS guidelines. Roger Pearce declined to comment. Last month, the scale of mistakes within the NHS was indicated by a pilot study in two London hospitals. Extrapolated nationally, 850,000 patients may be victims of error - 70,000 fatal - at a cost to the NHS of \u00a32 billion a year. Some Trusts have become highly proactive, investing in risk management and abandoning strategies based on defensiveness. Research indicates that only a fraction of medical errors work their way effectively through the present complaints procedure. It also indicates that most patients who have a grievance want a 'soft' resolution - an apology and an assurance that other patients will be better protected. The Health and Social Care Bill proposes that complaints first be dealt with at a local level by a Patient Advocacy and Liaison Service (Pals), employed by Trusts and far from independent. Autonomous Community Health Councils, which frequently offer advice and support to patients, will be abolished in England; Independent Patient Advocates, vague in detail, will take their place. David Hinchliffe is far from satisfied. 'It is putting the cart before the horse to alter the existing complaints mechanism before the publication of the Government's evaluation of the system. It also makes a nonsense of the period of consultation which it has promised will follow its own recommendations.' Susan Polywka of the Clinical Disputes Forum - lawyers, doctors and academics involved in medical negligence issues - which has produced its own suggestions for reforms - said: 'What's required is a simple one-stop shop - an accountable, independent, speedy process in the form of a tribunal, which can bring together investigation and compensation matters.' For Jean Brett, the options are exhausted. 'Decent people within the NHS have risked their jobs to give me information. It is to maintain that ethos and for the sake of other patients that, even after nine years, I have no choice but to fight on.'",

      "bodyText": "The Labour Party was last night accused of being 'institutionally racist' after an investigation revealed it will fail to hit its own target on electing black and Asian MPs at the next general election. As the row over race intensified yesterday, it emerged that 10 of the 12 new black and Asian candidates who will fight the election in June are in what the party admits are 'hopeless seats'. Labour is now fielding fewer black and Asian candidates than it did during the 1980s, despite a pledge by Tony Blair in 1997 that the party had to be a 'beacon to the world' and the number of black and Asian MPs should reflect the make-up of Britain. The embarrassing statistics will intensify the debate over race as Scotland Yard revealed that racist attacks soar each time a politician makes a speech on race or immigration. Officers in the Race and Violent Crime Task Force, set up after the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, said they were shocked to discover a direct relationship between political rhetoric, such as Tory leader William Hague's 'foreign land' speech, and an increase on attacks on asylum-seekers. Yesterday the Tories attempted to distance themselves from the compact on racist language put together by the Campaign for Racial Equality. The CRE report says 'racially hostile lan guage' must not be used during the election campaign. The row over race exploded when Tory MPs claimed the document prevented free speech, and Labour claimed refusal to sign the compact showed the true feeling within the Conservative Party about race. Hague tried to defuse the row yesterday, saying: 'I did not expect or require all candidates to sign the compact individually, as Michael Portillo made clear on Friday. 'I have instead placed Michael Ancram [the party chairman] in charge of investigating any alleged misconduct [on race].' On a day when race again dominated the political agenda, critics described the new Labour candidates as 'electoral cannon fodder' to keep up the appearance that progress was being made. They said if Blair's pledge was to be met, the number of black and Asian MPs should be 22, rather than the 12 likely to be elected, two more than at the last election. The vast majority of Labour's black and Asian candidates are facing huge Tory majorities and are often in third place behind the Liberal Democrats. 'It is sad, but the Labour Party suffers from the same degree of institutional racism that affects so many organisations in Britain,' said Sharon Grant, widow of the black Labour MP, Bernie. Takki Sulaiman has been given the task of fighting Huntingdon for the Labour Party, John Major's seat, one of the safest Tory seats in the country with a majority of more than 18,000. Mushtaq Hussain will fight Stratford-on-Avon which has a Conservative majority of more than 14,000 and Keir Dhillon will fight Tewkesbury where the Tory majority is nearly 10,000. 'The issue of race for New Labour is like a bunch of red roses on a table, it's purely decorative,' said black Labour MP Diane Abbott. 'Millbank [Labour's headquarters] is run by groups of young, white men, Tony Blair has surrounded himself with groups of young white men.' Gurbux Singh, the chairman of the CRE, said that the record of all the political parties in promoting black and Asian people was 'very disappointing'. A Labour spokesman said that, although Labour had done a lot to promote black and Asian candidates, 'much more needed to be done'. Senior police officers have also confirmed that racist attacks increase when politicians make speeches about asylum and immigration. One Scotland Yard source said: 'The most serious trend we have seen is a rise in reports of incidents when the issue of asylum seekers and refugees is brought into the public domain by reputable politicians making inflammatory statements.' Around 1,300 racially motivated incidents are reported to the Metropolitan police each month. The Monitoring Group, which provides advice and support to victims of racial harassment, confirmed there had been a threefold increase in reports of racial harassment and violence in March after the race issue was reignited by Hague's speech to the Conservative Party's spring conference. Asylum will dominate this week's Metropolitan Police conference on diversity. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stephens will say lessons learnt about racially motivated hate crime need to be applied to other areas, including abuse of the elderly, crime against the disabled and homophobic attacks. Home Secretary Jack Straw is under attack after pulling out of Tuesday's conference, planned to mark the anniversary of the death of Stephen Lawrence. Focus: Chicken tikka time bomb",

      "body": "<p>Imagine the chorus of criticism if a collection of state-owned companies had wasted tens of billions of pounds in duplicating their efforts amid juicy stories of fraud, cheating and epic miscalculations and whose excesses now threatened the world with a recession. The attack-dog columnists of the right- wing press would be outdoing themselves in their excoriation of all things to do with the public sector and pleading for more privatisation and deregulation. But when the same happens in the world of private enterprise, silence descends.</p> <p>What has happened to the global telecoms industry and, not least, to British Telecom, is a salutary lesson to all those who buy the simple proposition that public is bad and private is good. Over the last five years, American, European and Asian telecom companies have run up more than $700 billion of debt in outdoing themselves to bid for a stake in the communications action. Now the industry lies crippled in debt as the dotcom bubble has burst. Conservatively, at least $100bn will never be repaid, posing a mounting threat to the integrity of the world banking system. There have been 100,000 telecom job losses worldwide in the last 10 weeks and with Ericsson's announcement of another 12,000 on Friday the pace is accelerating.</p> <p>In the same way that we don't need a multiplicity of gas, electricity or water distribution networks, we never needed the multiplicity of mobile phone and broadband networks on which the boom was predicated. There will now be a round of mergers and takeovers and we will be left with powerful, private-sector monopoly networks instead of ones accountable to the public through public ownership. But the transitional devastation will contribute to recession as companies slash their telecom and IT spending while banks nurse their bad debts. Capitalism in this style does not get much more stupid.</p> <p>The irrationality of greed of the companies is a majestic condemnation of the way unmanaged and deregulated markets work. They paid too much for the licences for third-generation, mobile-phone radio spectrums in Britain and elsewhere because nobody dared risk being the odd man out without a licence. It was ridiculous that the American giants tried to build competing domestic and international networks as if telephone networks were like any other consumer durable, so more than halving their rates of return and quadrupling their debt. It was absurd that the partially privatised German and French telecom companies tried simultaneously to do everything in the information and communication revolution, along with our own BT. The three now have, respectively, \u00a335bn, \u00a340bn and \u00a330bn of debt.</p> <p>But as they and their equally indebted American and Asian counterparts cut back their spending, manufacturers of telecom equipment feel the knock-on effect. In the US, Cisco, Nortel and Lucent are reeling from the impact; there is speculation, which is denied, that Lucent is on the point of bankruptcy. As the companies desperately try to maintain the pace of technological innovation in order to provoke consumers to keep up their spending on the next wave of products to bail them out of their debts, so mistakes are made. The toe-curling BT press conference last week, when the new net-connected handsets failed in their public demonstration, is only the most raw example of how too hastily designed equipment is not working as it should.On top of it all, sales are slowing down.</p> <p>All this interacts with the unwinding of the dotcom bubble, the companies which were projected to deliver so much increased traffic through the new networks and whose failures make the economics of network building so much more hazardous. If the CEOs of telecom companies were chasing their generous share options in their absurd expansion plans, they look like Snow Whites beside the avarice of the US and UK investment banking community which duped the investing public into what was close to theft. In the last two years, 1,262 hi-tech companies went public in New York; the shares of 152 can now be bought for less than a dollar and most of the others have fallen by two-thirds or more. Not that the investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs care; they earned more than $600 million of fees. It was a wealth transfer from ordinary savers' pension funds into the pockets of overpaid bankers on an unparalleled scale.</p> <p>That is not all. More and more troubling stories of fraud are surfacing as 'entrepreneurs' proved increasingly innovative with the truth as they tried to cash in on the boom and disguise the frailty of their companies. Lemout &amp; Hauspie, a voice-recognition company, is under investigation in the US for fiddling its accounts. Lucent is involved with a now-dead fraudster. Even the mighty Deutsche Telekom is being investigated for overstating the value of its property assets by half. And in Britain, we are discovering the industry has exaggerated the scale of mobile-phone sales by around a quarter.</p> <p>The defenders of all this will argue that the greater prize is technological innovation and that capitalism has always involved some jiggery-pokery at the margins; better this than any socialist alternative. But to object to waste, duplication, fraud and avarice on such an epic scale is not to argue for the Soviet Union or British nationalised industries.</p> <p>Instead it is, to insist on straight thinking by governments about the limits of markets. Telephone networks are natural monopolies and public goods; the objective must be to offer cheap access to all. Duplicating networks is an economic nonsense. Better one mobile-phone network, with universal coverage and one network of masts, than four incomplete networks and many more masts with their potential radiation risk.</p> <p>Equally, privatising a monopoly network simply offers the privatised monopoly owner the cash flow on which to build a debt mountain to make stupid acquisitions, as the experience across the globe proves. The trouble is that free-market ideology, sponsored by the all-powerful Americans, taught otherwise and nobody stood up for a different concept in which the public ownership and public construction of networks was seen as rational and economically efficient. We followed like lemmings andhave a telecoms d\u00e9bcle to match the disaster in the US. And still nobody dares say the emperor has no clothes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imagine the chorus of criticism if a collection of state-owned companies had wasted tens of billions of pounds in duplicating their efforts amid juicy stories of fraud, cheating and epic miscalculations and whose excesses now threatened the world with a recession. The attack-dog columnists of the right- wing press would be outdoing themselves in their excoriation of all things to do with the public sector and pleading for more privatisation and deregulation. But when the same happens in the world of private enterprise, silence descends. What has happened to the global telecoms industry and, not least, to British Telecom, is a salutary lesson to all those who buy the simple proposition that public is bad and private is good. Over the last five years, American, European and Asian telecom companies have run up more than $700 billion of debt in outdoing themselves to bid for a stake in the communications action. Now the industry lies crippled in debt as the dotcom bubble has burst. Conservatively, at least $100bn will never be repaid, posing a mounting threat to the integrity of the world banking system. There have been 100,000 telecom job losses worldwide in the last 10 weeks and with Ericsson's announcement of another 12,000 on Friday the pace is accelerating. In the same way that we don't need a multiplicity of gas, electricity or water distribution networks, we never needed the multiplicity of mobile phone and broadband networks on which the boom was predicated. There will now be a round of mergers and takeovers and we will be left with powerful, private-sector monopoly networks instead of ones accountable to the public through public ownership. But the transitional devastation will contribute to recession as companies slash their telecom and IT spending while banks nurse their bad debts. Capitalism in this style does not get much more stupid. The irrationality of greed of the companies is a majestic condemnation of the way unmanaged and deregulated markets work. They paid too much for the licences for third-generation, mobile-phone radio spectrums in Britain and elsewhere because nobody dared risk being the odd man out without a licence. It was ridiculous that the American giants tried to build competing domestic and international networks as if telephone networks were like any other consumer durable, so more than halving their rates of return and quadrupling their debt. It was absurd that the partially privatised German and French telecom companies tried simultaneously to do everything in the information and communication revolution, along with our own BT. The three now have, respectively, \u00a335bn, \u00a340bn and \u00a330bn of debt. But as they and their equally indebted American and Asian counterparts cut back their spending, manufacturers of telecom equipment feel the knock-on effect. In the US, Cisco, Nortel and Lucent are reeling from the impact; there is speculation, which is denied, that Lucent is on the point of bankruptcy. As the companies desperately try to maintain the pace of technological innovation in order to provoke consumers to keep up their spending on the next wave of products to bail them out of their debts, so mistakes are made. The toe-curling BT press conference last week, when the new net-connected handsets failed in their public demonstration, is only the most raw example of how too hastily designed equipment is not working as it should.On top of it all, sales are slowing down. All this interacts with the unwinding of the dotcom bubble, the companies which were projected to deliver so much increased traffic through the new networks and whose failures make the economics of network building so much more hazardous. If the CEOs of telecom companies were chasing their generous share options in their absurd expansion plans, they look like Snow Whites beside the avarice of the US and UK investment banking community which duped the investing public into what was close to theft. In the last two years, 1,262 hi-tech companies went public in New York; the shares of 152 can now be bought for less than a dollar and most of the others have fallen by two-thirds or more. Not that the investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs care; they earned more than $600 million of fees. It was a wealth transfer from ordinary savers' pension funds into the pockets of overpaid bankers on an unparalleled scale. That is not all. More and more troubling stories of fraud are surfacing as 'entrepreneurs' proved increasingly innovative with the truth as they tried to cash in on the boom and disguise the frailty of their companies. Lemout &amp; Hauspie, a voice-recognition company, is under investigation in the US for fiddling its accounts. Lucent is involved with a now-dead fraudster. Even the mighty Deutsche Telekom is being investigated for overstating the value of its property assets by half. And in Britain, we are discovering the industry has exaggerated the scale of mobile-phone sales by around a quarter. The defenders of all this will argue that the greater prize is technological innovation and that capitalism has always involved some jiggery-pokery at the margins; better this than any socialist alternative. But to object to waste, duplication, fraud and avarice on such an epic scale is not to argue for the Soviet Union or British nationalised industries. Instead it is, to insist on straight thinking by governments about the limits of markets. Telephone networks are natural monopolies and public goods; the objective must be to offer cheap access to all. Duplicating networks is an economic nonsense. Better one mobile-phone network, with universal coverage and one network of masts, than four incomplete networks and many more masts with their potential radiation risk. Equally, privatising a monopoly network simply offers the privatised monopoly owner the cash flow on which to build a debt mountain to make stupid acquisitions, as the experience across the globe proves. The trouble is that free-market ideology, sponsored by the all-powerful Americans, taught otherwise and nobody stood up for a different concept in which the public ownership and public construction of networks was seen as rational and economically efficient. We followed like lemmings andhave a telecoms d\u00e9bcle to match the disaster in the US. And still nobody dares say the emperor has no clothes.",

      "body": "<p>This year's Chilli Fest at Cisco System's headquarters in California is likely to be a muted affair. The mass cook- out for the thousands of employees who work at the company's San Jose campus is usually one of the highlights of their year, an annual morale-boosting jamboree giving them the chance to bond with the top execs. But after a disastrous downturn in company fortunes that rendered their share options worthless, Cisco's employees have little to cheer about. </p> <p>In the past the Chilli Fest has given the event's master chef, Cisco's evangelical CEO John Chambers, a chance to whip his staff into a new economy fervour by preaching the all-encompassing doctrine that the internet is akin to the Moon landing 10 times over. </p> <p>'This is truly the second Industrial Revolution, and it will change every aspect of people's lives,' Chambers has said many, many times. The inference he wants the world to draw is that Cisco, the maker of 70 per cent of the world's routers (gizmos that direct internet traffic around networks), is in pole position to benefit as the information revolution takes off. </p> <p>Chambers is a master salesman, a man who will probably have 'Always Be Closing' written on his gravestone. His dedication to the sales cause is the stuff of new economy legend. He's the man who hands out his home phone number and begs clients to ring him whenever they want - a throwback to his days as a salesman for IBM, when he was encouraged to 'sell the dream'. </p> <p>He's the man who regularly walks around the Cisco HQ - known as Pleasantville - handing out ice creams to staff. He's the man who, on a company fishing trip, refused to return to shore when a storm blew up because he was hell bent on catching more fish than his colleagues. </p> <p>Such dedication to the cause has earned Chambers a clutch of sobriquets. He is Mr Internet, the king of the new world networked economy. 'What Bill Gates is to PCs, John Chambers has become for the net,' one admiring tech firm president said. </p> <p>Al Gore called him a 'true leader of the global economy'. Forbes magazine called him 'the most powerful CEO in industry'. He's a Wall Street darling, a dyslexic who studied hard for his MBA from Indiana University then ended up steering Cisco from a company with revenues of $1.3 billion in 1994 to more than $18bn last year. Cisco's market value soared as a result, from $9bn when Chambers took over in 1995 to almost $600bn in March 2000, briefly making it the world's most valuable company. The influential Fortune magazine rates Cisco the second most admired company in the world and the third best to work for. </p> <p>Inevitably, the world's politicians have descended on Cisco's HQ to have their photo taken with the net prophet who, unusually in the dotcom world, runs a company that makes profits. </p> <p>On the walls of Cisco's offices there are pictures of the luminaries who have come to pay homage to San Jose's favourite firm: UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. There are pictures of Chambers swapping gags with Bill Clinton and chatting with China's President, Jiang Zemin. He's also close to President Bush. </p> <p>But people on pedestals have the furthest to fall, and last week the wheels well and truly came off Cisco's tram. Chambers suffered the ignominy of having to confess that the company's third-quarter earnings will be dramatically short of Wall Street's expectations. </p> <p>Whereas US analysts had been predicting earnings of around eight cents a share, Chambers said they would now be in the 'very low, single-digit range'. Revenues for the third quarter would be 30 per cent down on the previous quarter, to around $4.7bn - the first time they have dropped for consecutive periods in Cisco's 11-year history. This time last year Cisco's sales were growing 60 per cent quarter-on-quarter. The share price plunged 3 per cent to $16.66 after the news. Once, the share price had come close to the $80 mark. </p> <p>As befits his messiah status, Chambers resorted to biblical allegory to describe how bad things had become. 'A dramatic decline in quarter-on-quarter revenues would be 10 per cent. This shows that a once-in-100-years flood can happen in your lifetime.' </p> <p>It was the latest in a long line of body blows that Cisco, the bellwether stock of the new economy, has delivered to the market. In January, Chambers said the current second-quarter market was a 'little bit more challenging' than anticipated. A few weeks later, at second-quarter results, he said: 'The next several quarters will be challenging.' Then in March Cisco announced 7,500 jobs were to go. By last week this had risen to 8,500 worldwide. Cisco employs about 2,000 in the UK, 35,000 in total. </p> <p>Chambers, 51, argued that such a drastic cull was essential. 'This may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated, which has required us to make difficult business decisions at an unprecedented speed.' </p> <p>The disciples of the new economy, who accept the argument that businesses these days have to turn on a dime if they are to stay competitive, would understand. </p> <p>Indeed, Chambers, who described having to sack 3,000 employees when he was helping to run computer manufacturer Wang Laboratories in the early 1990s as the 'worst experience of his life', argues: 'Companies that are successful will have cultures that thrive on change, even though change makes most people very uncomfortable.' </p> <p>What has stuck in Wall Street's craw is the fact that Cisco doesn't seem to have adapted quickly enough. Despite ominous signs towards the end of last year that telecom firms were paring back on capital expenditure, Cisco failed to cut its order book down to size. It is now faced with taking a $2.5bn hit for excess inventory on top of the $1.2bn it is writing off in restructuring costs. </p> <p>The company, which for years has been asking customers: 'Are you ready?', was itself found wanting. This is not just a major embarrassment, it's a serious business problem for a company that has used itself as a marketing tool for its products. </p> <p>It has made great claims for its sophisticated web-based ordering system, holding it up as a model for how its clients should transform their procurement operations. Cisco has boasted that by harnessing the power of the net it has saved more than $800m a year. Now it has undermined such claims and the whole US technology sector, which saw Cisco as its model, has taken a battering. If the prophet can't deliver on his promises, what chance is there for his disciples? </p> <p>In a bid to start a fresh new economy cheerleading campaign, Chambers has already started talking of 30 to 50 per cent sales growth in the long term, a claim that is raising analysts' eyebrows. </p> <p>'Fifty per cent growth rates are totally unsustainable. Sure, there will be growth, but it will be in the mid teens. After the events of last week I would have expected him to be a bit more chastened,' said Adrian Murray, electronics analyst with broker Teather &amp; Greenwood. </p> <p>What happens next depends on whether Cisco's attempts to spread its tentacles across the web will pay off. In order to diversify from old 'mature areas', notably routers, and into new sectors, chiefly optical networking (the infrastructure capable of carrying truly massive amounts of data), Cisco has been on a huge acquisition spree, gobbling up more than 70 companies in seven years. </p> <p>Inevitably, given its sky-high share price, Cisco has used its paper to finance the deals, most famously the $6.9bn acquisition of Cerant, a company that, at the time of the acquisition two years ago, had revenues of only $10m. 'It's promising technology, but the price it paid was very high,' said Dr Peter Kjeldsen, industry analyst with the Gartner Group. </p> <p>To add to fears it overpaid on some deals, more focused upstarts, such as Juniper Networks, are now nibbling at its heels. If the Cisco HQ is to receive more visits from the great and the good, it has to prove it can see them off. </p> <p>As Chambers is fond of saying: 'You've got to walk the talk.' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,476412,00.html\">Greenspan at mercy of the markets (pt 2)</a></p>",

Here come the half-time summaries. They are heavyweight (these three alone run to 1,800 pages and 8lb on my bathroom scales) but they are also inevitably conditional accounts of work in progress. Their relevance, for all their bulk and diligence, will fade with June's election results. But for the moment, as superior offerings at the crossroads where academia and journalism meet, they serve a vital purpose. </p> <p>What, emerging from the disinfectant trough of desuetude, do we imagine this election will be about? On the face of it, dispiritingly little. The first cheapjack posters sneering about 'Economic Disaster II' mingle with selective statistics and ritual insults; another grubby, cynical exercise in democratic catharsis. Pause, though, over <strong> The Blair Effect</strong>, for it is a treat. </p> <p>Anthony Seldon has gathered together 28 of the experts you most want to read and set them assessing the way their patches have changed since 1997. And the first fascinating thing, in so many territories, is to see not how little has altered, but how much. The second fascinating - and damning - thing is to see how scantily those upheavals have been evaluated or absorbed. </p> <p>Is the Westminster Parliament as boring and irrelevant as our pundits proclaim? Or is it subtly transformed into a 'a parliament for England, a parliament for primary legislation for Wales and a federal parliament for Northern Ireland and Scotland', as Vernon Bogdanor asserts? 'Whether or not devolution means the end of the United Kingdom, it... marks the end of one strand at least of socialism or social democracy, namely the belief that a benign government at Westminster can secure the distribution of benefits and burdens on the basis not of geography, but of need.' </p> <p>Can Prime Ministers deliver sudden physical change any longer or have they, as Christopher Foster argues over transport, become hapless victims of the switch they themselves engineered from hierarchical command structures to policy networks? 'With all their faults, hierarchies generally at their roots were sufficiently close to earth to make things happen. Policy networks mean long and sometimes endless chains of consultation... which frequently get in the way of the action.' </p> <p>Is social policy still natural Labour territory? Or is it, as Howard Glennester wonders, now much harder for a party of the Left to manage than a party of the Right? 'Populist attacks on welfare win votes, but crafting a solid future for welfare institutions within a severe tax constraint, against attacks from traditionalists on the left and critics on the right, is much more difficult.' </p> <p>These, and many more like them, aren't the headline questions of the coming campaign - they are nuanced broods about the body politic. They are also at least part of the answer to the question posed relentlessly through the three books. Who is the 'real' Tony Blair? Is he an actor or an extraordinary ordinary bloke? A manic control freak or a dedicated devolver? A frustrated man of inaction or a driving reformer? The tendency, of course, is to puzzle over those contradictions: the true answer, however, may be that he is the unleasher of forces - within society and the apparatus of governance - which he, and we, barely understand as yet. </p> <p>We think of him as 'presidential', but he is the precise opposite, a determined disburser of presidential power - to Scotland and Wales, to city mayors and regional development authorities, to Brussels and Belfast, to the Bank of England. Where an election system, as in Edinburgh or Cardiff, favours his party, he changes it and loses influence as a result. He has done the same, pretty remarkably, for his Strasbourg MEPs.

Here come the half-time summaries. They are heavyweight (these three alone run to 1,800 pages and 8lb on my bathroom scales) but they are also inevitably conditional accounts of work in progress. Their relevance, for all their bulk and diligence, will fade with June's election results. But for the moment, as superior offerings at the crossroads where academia and journalism meet, they serve a vital purpose. What, emerging from the disinfectant trough of desuetude, do we imagine this election will be about? On the face of it, dispiritingly little. The first cheapjack posters sneering about 'Economic Disaster II' mingle with selective statistics and ritual insults; another grubby, cynical exercise in democratic catharsis. Pause, though, over The Blair Effect, for it is a treat. Anthony Seldon has gathered together 28 of the experts you most want to read and set them assessing the way their patches have changed since 1997. And the first fascinating thing, in so many territories, is to see not how little has altered, but how much. The second fascinating - and damning - thing is to see how scantily those upheavals have been evaluated or absorbed. Is the Westminster Parliament as boring and irrelevant as our pundits proclaim? Or is it subtly transformed into a 'a parliament for England, a parliament for primary legislation for Wales and a federal parliament for Northern Ireland and Scotland', as Vernon Bogdanor asserts? 'Whether or not devolution means the end of the United Kingdom, it... marks the end of one strand at least of socialism or social democracy, namely the belief that a benign government at Westminster can secure the distribution of benefits and burdens on the basis not of geography, but of need.' Can Prime Ministers deliver sudden physical change any longer or have they, as Christopher Foster argues over transport, become hapless victims of the switch they themselves engineered from hierarchical command structures to policy networks? 'With all their faults, hierarchies generally at their roots were sufficiently close to earth to make things happen. Policy networks mean long and sometimes endless chains of consultation... which frequently get in the way of the action.' Is social policy still natural Labour territory? Or is it, as Howard Glennester wonders, now much harder for a party of the Left to manage than a party of the Right? 'Populist attacks on welfare win votes, but crafting a solid future for welfare institutions within a severe tax constraint, against attacks from traditionalists on the left and critics on the right, is much more difficult.' These, and many more like them, aren't the headline questions of the coming campaign - they are nuanced broods about the body politic. They are also at least part of the answer to the question posed relentlessly through the three books. Who is the 'real' Tony Blair? Is he an actor or an extraordinary ordinary bloke? A manic control freak or a dedicated devolver? A frustrated man of inaction or a driving reformer? The tendency, of course, is to puzzle over those contradictions: the true answer, however, may be that he is the unleasher of forces - within society and the apparatus of governance - which he, and we, barely understand as yet. We think of him as 'presidential', but he is the precise opposite, a determined disburser of presidential power - to Scotland and Wales, to city mayors and regional development authorities, to Brussels and Belfast, to the Bank of England. Where an election system, as in Edinburgh or Cardiff, favours his party, he changes it and loses influence as a result. He has done the same, pretty remarkably, for his Strasbourg MEPs. The old House of Lords has gone. Our law is no longer sovereign because it incorporates and embraces the European Convention on Human Rights. Our information may not be exactly free yet, but the tide of restriction has turned. Our election spending is about to be honestly regulated. This is a formidable agenda of constitutional change (one very cogently laid out in John Morrison's admirable primer to the revolution) and it cannot be abandoned or rolled back. It is the way we are now, but not yet, perhaps, how we see ourselves or how the lobby correspondents of Westminster see their readers. In that sense, John Rentoul's revised biography of Blair, admirable as he first stepped into Downing Street, is less compelling for its added accounts of the routine ups and downs of office, the Mandelsons and the Robinsons, because it's not able to stand back far enough to see the big picture. Morrison has seen it; Bogdanor and many chroniclers of The Blair Effect have seen it, too. We'll know in a few weeks time if the voting public has even realised it exists. Constitutional change may, in Millbank terms, be porridge for policy wonks.

      "body": "<p>I am sitting at Le Caprice with five incredibly thin women from a fashion magazine - all Prada peeptoes and Fendi bags, pushing their salads round their plates, drinking mineral water and chain smoking. These women don't swallow, they simply rearrange the food on their plates. I am the only one to order pudding. Before you can say stick insect, a perfectly co-ordinated air attack of spoons and fingers entirely demolishes my hot treacle sponge and custard. I am left with three large crumbs, a smudge of sauce and someone else's licked spoon. </p> <p>You should not mess with anyone else's pudding. Pudding is important for our wellbeing, our soul. You see, pudding is not a treat but a necessity. It is there to heal and comfort, to cosset and hug. Pudding is not food, it is medicine. </p> <p>There is an unshakeable link between stress and pudding. At least there is in my house. It is not silver that lines my black clouds but butter, sugar, jam and cream. Warm, milky rice pudding and a blob of red jam is as effective an ointment for a bad time as tea-tree cream is for a cut finger. </p> <p>The puds we turn to for comfort are inevitably those that remind us of our childhood, or more likely, an imaginary one - those dream-like sugar-and-spice-filled early years that never really existed. A mother in an apron brandishing a rolling pin; a cupboard lined with home-made plum jam; a kitchen filled with the smell of baking and warm spice. </p> <p>The rules are simple: for dessert that heals rather than simply pleases, it must be stunningly sweet or blissfully milky. Like treacle sponge or, better still, treacle tart where you get pastry, too, or perhaps the rice pudding - the ultimate panacea for every ill in the book. </p> <p>Any sensible person knows that rice pudding was invented for humans either too young or too old to feed themselves. I am willing to bet more rice pud has slithered down chins than has ever been swallowed. Perhaps it is exactly that bland creaminess that has kept this slow-baked slurry of rice, milk and sugar a favourite in home and restaurant kitchens for centuries. It has never been out of fashion, nor, mercifully, 'in' either. </p> <p>Obviously in serious need of being bounced on someone's knee, I recently tucked into a restaurant dessert of rice pudding in a pastry shell. Come to think of it, I must have needed a hug as well, as it also came with a caramel coat.

This is also one of those mysterious puddings that is better the day after you make it, when the pastry has gone ever-so-slightly soft. </p> <p>With sugar in mind, you could turn to any one of our school-meal puddings and eat yourself into a good mood.

      "bodyText": "I am sitting at Le Caprice with five incredibly thin women from a fashion magazine - all Prada peeptoes and Fendi bags, pushing their salads round their plates, drinking mineral water and chain smoking. These women don't swallow, they simply rearrange the food on their plates. I am the only one to order pudding. Before you can say stick insect, a perfectly co-ordinated air attack of spoons and fingers entirely demolishes my hot treacle sponge and custard. I am left with three large crumbs, a smudge of sauce and someone else's licked spoon. You should not mess with anyone else's pudding. Pudding is important for our wellbeing, our soul. You see, pudding is not a treat but a necessity. It is there to heal and comfort, to cosset and hug. Pudding is not food, it is medicine. There is an unshakeable link between stress and pudding. At least there is in my house. It is not silver that lines my black clouds but butter, sugar, jam and cream. Warm, milky rice pudding and a blob of red jam is as effective an ointment for a bad time as tea-tree cream is for a cut finger. The puds we turn to for comfort are inevitably those that remind us of our childhood, or more likely, an imaginary one - those dream-like sugar-and-spice-filled early years that never really existed. A mother in an apron brandishing a rolling pin; a cupboard lined with home-made plum jam; a kitchen filled with the smell of baking and warm spice. The rules are simple: for dessert that heals rather than simply pleases, it must be stunningly sweet or blissfully milky. Like treacle sponge or, better still, treacle tart where you get pastry, too, or perhaps the rice pudding - the ultimate panacea for every ill in the book. Any sensible person knows that rice pudding was invented for humans either too young or too old to feed themselves. I am willing to bet more rice pud has slithered down chins than has ever been swallowed. Perhaps it is exactly that bland creaminess that has kept this slow-baked slurry of rice, milk and sugar a favourite in home and restaurant kitchens for centuries. It has never been out of fashion, nor, mercifully, 'in' either. Obviously in serious need of being bounced on someone's knee, I recently tucked into a restaurant dessert of rice pudding in a pastry shell. Come to think of it, I must have needed a hug as well, as it also came with a caramel coat. (I didn't order it, you understand, but was helping out a friend whose eyes had been bigger than her belly.) In theory, pastry, creamy rice and caramel sauce should have been the ultimate in comfort eating. It wasn't. It was as if a much-loved nanny was holding a pillow over your head till you stopped breathing. Modern versions invariably contain cream and a double dose of sugar.

      "body": "<p>The weeds are coming! Take the children indoors and close the shutters, hide the seed corn and let the livestock fend for itself. OK, it is not exactly barbarian hordes raping and pillaging, but the inexorable invasion of the garden by weeds can feel like enemy action. In my own garden, almost nothing else has grown over the past few weeks except the weeds, which, unlike every other form of vegetation, seems to be enjoying this dismal spring with unhealthy relish. </p> <p>I have creeping buttercup, burdock, greater and lesser celandine, couch grass, bindweed, docks and nettles all doing very nicely, thank you, and those are just the perennials. All the annual weeds, such as the great rafts of goosegrass, caper spurge, wavy bittercress, shepherd's-purse, dead nettle, shepherd's needle, groundsel and sow thistle are showing up nicely - God's crop, joker that he undoubtedly is. </p> <p>There is a school of thought that gets all touchy-feely about weeds, saying that, hey, they are just plants in the wrong place, right? Well, no. A weed is a plant you don't want, it is acne on a beautiful face or hairs in the soup. Not the end of the world, but we don't want them. But there are some positive things to learn from weeds before you get rid of them. For a start, the greater fecundity of your weed population, the healthier and better conditioned is your soil. Secondly, the greater the diversity of weed types, the healthier your garden environment and the greater the range of plants that you will eventually be able to grow. A wide range of weeds will also attract a wide selection of insects and do much to contribute to the holistic balance of your garden - which is the very essence of successful organic gardening. (And chemical gardening is a bore. Stop it at once.) </p> <p>The type and limitations of the weeds growing are a useful indicator of the nature and condition of your soil. Very acidic soil will produce lots of sorrel and plantain, but no charlock or poppy which thrive on lime. Chickweed is a good indicator of a neutral pH. Nettles, ground elder, fat hen and chickweed point to a soil high in nitrogen. Silverweed and greater plantain will grow on very compacted soil. Creeping buttercup, horsetail and silverweed (again) point to a wet soil with poor drainage. Lastly, some weeds are very good to eat. Now is the best time to make nettle soup, using just the freshest new growth. Dandelion leaves are good in salad, ground elder was originally grown as a vegetable crop, wild sorrel makes a good sauce and horseradish, which can be one of the most intrusive of all weeds, is essential to a rib of beef. </p> <p>In practical terms, there are two types of weed for the gardener, perennial and annual. Both are bad because they compete with your chosen plants for water and nutrition, and the nature of all prolific weeds is that they are extremely good at grabbing all available goodness. Obviously, there are places where this competition is less harmful - around mature trees and shrubs or along the bottom of a fully grown hedge. But hedges can be the last resort of perennial weeds in an otherwise weed-free garden. We have bindweed, greater celandine, creeping buttercup and couchgrass all firmly entrenched in our hornbeam hedges. Sometimes you can use weeds to improve the quality of a crop. I am thinking particularly of onions, which must be kept weed-free until they are fully grown, but which ripen better if they are then starved by weeds so that no more growing energy goes into top growth. But, in general, aim at a weed-free garden. </p> <p>Any regular reader of this page will know that in my book this does not include any kind of chemical control. Chemicals are very good at destroying weeds, but they also destroy plants you want to keep and - I believe - your health, let alone the micro-diversity of your soil and the insect life of your garden. I am convinced that there is never any need to use chemical weedkillers and that conviction is based upon experience. Weedkillers are pushed hard by chemical companies because they are enormously profitable. That's all. </p> <p>There are other ways to deal with weeds: </p> <p><strong>1 Hoe.</strong> There are lots of hoes available, but there are only two basic principles: you either push or you pull. I find I use a Dutch hoe most of the time, which, if kept sharp, slices through the roots of any weeds just below the surface of the soil. The secret of hoeing - like all weeding - is to do it little and often. If you have a very weed-infested bit of ground you want to cultivate (and remember, weed-infestation implies good healthy soil) and they have not yet gone to seed, then hoe the weeds off with a mattock or large draw or field hoe, let the weeds wilt for a day in the sun and then dig the whole thing over, weeds and all. This will not get rid of the perennial weeds but will increase the fertility and allow you to grow a crop of fast-growing, weed-suppressing vegetables such as potatoes, beans or squashes. </p> <p><strong> 2 Mulch.</strong> Cover every piece of bare soil with a light-excluding but moisture-permeable layer. I use mushroom and garden compost and cocoa shells. Well-rotted horse or cattle manure is good, but cattle manure can include a lot of weed seeds if it is not very well-rotted. But anything will do, including straw, hay, shredded bark, permeable plastic, old carpet, or rolls of white paper mulch. If you are using an organic mulch (ie, one that will rot down into the soil), place it at least 2in thick - 4in is better. This will not stop existing perennial weeds growing through but will make them much easier to pull up. </p> <p><strong> 3 Hand-weed.</strong> First the bad news: hand-weeding means getting down on your knees and removing every scrap of weed. Now the good news: it is one of the most enjoyable aspects of gardening. You get to know your soil, your plants, the seedlings and herbaceous perennials coming through. </p> <p><strong> 4 Timing.</strong> You must remove weeds before they seed. The old adage 'one year's seeding means seven years' weeding' is pretty much accurate.</p> <p><strong>My weeds: Monty's list of garden horrors</strong></p> <p><strong>Annuals</strong></p> <p><strong>Never let these seed:</strong>shepherd's-purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris); bittercress (Cardamine); fat hen (Chenopodium album); caper spurge (Euphorbia lathyrus); petty spurge (Euphorbia peplus); goosegrass (Galium aparine); herb Robert (Geranium robertianum); Himalaya balsam (Impatiens glandifulifera); knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare); shepherd's needle (Scandix pectenveneris); groundsel (Senecio vulgaris); charlock (Sinapsis arvensis) ; prickly sow thistle (Sonchus asper); chickweed (Stellaria media)</p> <p><strong>Perennials</strong></p> <p><strong>Very difficult (will take long-term strategy or inspired acceptance):</strong> Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum); horsetail (Equisetum)</p> <p><strong>Take very seriously (dig up every scrap of root and burn):</strong> ground elder (Aegopodium podagraria); bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis, Calystegia sepium); creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens); couch grass (Agropyron repens); lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria)</p> <p><strong>Work at (dig up as and when you can):</strong> broad- leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius); nettles (Urtica dioica); spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare); creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense); burdock (Arctium lappa)</p> <p><strong>Handsome (but intrusive):</strong> daisy (Bellis perennis); greater celandine (Chelidonium majus); teasel (Dipsacus fullonum); rosebay willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium); hogweed (Heracleum spondylium); dead-nettle (Lamium); alkanet (Pentaglottis sempervirens); mallow (Malva sylvestris); plantain (Plantago major); silverweed (Potentilla anserina); selfheal (Prunella vulgaris); comfrey (Symphytum); feverfew (Tanacetum); dandelion (Taraxacum).</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>Harry is out on the JCB. I'm anxious, mainly because he is petrified. Harry dug our septic tank 10 years ago, when the garden was no more than a gleam in my eye. It was the first and last time he had ever operated a digger. It will take a couple of days Harry, I say. And more than a couple of Valium, he mutters. I haven't slept all weekend. It's a bit tricky_ </p> <p>You may remember that we flooded last autumn and our septic tank was out of use for three weeks. So we have arranged for another one to be put in, which means digging up a large piece of the garden. To be honest, I had almost forgotten about it, but they turned up yesterday with JCB, dumper and a lorryload of stone. It was like knowing that you had a nagging tooth and coming down to breakfast to find the dentist hovering over your chair, drill ready whirring.</p> <p>Did I say that it has rained all week? That the garden is like a slurry. That even a wheelbarrow is almost impossible to manoeuvre on the grass? So a JCB_ never mind. It must be done.</p> <p>The new bench for the greenhouse has been delivered. It is all aluminium and stainless steel. No soul but we are now seriously smart in the greenhouse department. We don't need this, of course. It is a way of pretending to be more professional and grown-up than we ever are, and the trick works every time I walk in there. Every inch is now laden with seedlings. I made some soil blocks the other day, sowed them with Little Gem lettuce and Mizuna, went off to Birmingham next morning to spend a day filming, came back, and I swear that all had germinated and were sprigged with leaf. Magic.</p> <p>Rather grudgingly I tackled the lesser celandine in the spring garden. There is no joy in this kind of weeding because it has infiltrated nooks and crannies so thoroughly that inevitably precious hellebore seedlings are taken up as you fork, however carefully you do it. It is a real object lesson in weed control, as it should have been tackled properly last year, but as it wasn't too bad I let it go. Fatal.</p> <p>It is the wetness in the spring garden from global warming that has ruined the drainage system, which has meant digging new drains that has upset Harry so much. It's all that George Dubya Bush's fault. I'd get him to come over and remove the celandines and send him penitent back to Kyoto, but Harry says he'd have to do the JCB stuff first. That would sort him.</p>",

I am convinced that there is never any need to use chemical weedkillers and that conviction is based upon experience. Weedkillers are pushed hard by chemical companies because they are enormously profitable. That's all. There are other ways to deal with weeds: 1 Hoe. There are lots of hoes available, but there are only two basic principles: you either push or you pull. I find I use a Dutch hoe most of the time, which, if kept sharp, slices through the roots of any weeds just below the surface of the soil. The secret of hoeing - like all weeding - is to do it little and often. If you have a very weed-infested bit of ground you want to cultivate (and remember, weed-infestation implies good healthy soil) and they have not yet gone to seed, then hoe the weeds off with a mattock or large draw or field hoe, let the weeds wilt for a day in the sun and then dig the whole thing over, weeds and all. This will not get rid of the perennial weeds but will increase the fertility and allow you to grow a crop of fast-growing, weed-suppressing vegetables such as potatoes, beans or squashes. 2 Mulch. Cover every piece of bare soil with a light-excluding but moisture-permeable layer. I use mushroom and garden compost and cocoa shells. Well-rotted horse or cattle manure is good, but cattle manure can include a lot of weed seeds if it is not very well-rotted. But anything will do, including straw, hay, shredded bark, permeable plastic, old carpet, or rolls of white paper mulch. If you are using an organic mulch (ie, one that will rot down into the soil), place it at least 2in thick - 4in is better. This will not stop existing perennial weeds growing through but will make them much easier to pull up. 3 Hand-weed. First the bad news: hand-weeding means getting down on your knees and removing every scrap of weed. Now the good news: it is one of the most enjoyable aspects of gardening. You get to know your soil, your plants, the seedlings and herbaceous perennials coming through. 4 Timing. You must remove weeds before they seed. The old adage 'one year's seeding means seven years' weeding' is pretty much accurate. My weeds: Monty's list of garden horrors Annuals Never let these seed:shepherd's-purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris); bittercress (Cardamine); fat hen (Chenopodium album); caper spurge (Euphorbia lathyrus); petty spurge (Euphorbia peplus); goosegrass (Galium aparine); herb Robert (Geranium robertianum); Himalaya balsam (Impatiens glandifulifera); knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare); shepherd's needle (Scandix pectenveneris); groundsel (Senecio vulgaris); charlock (Sinapsis arvensis) ; prickly sow thistle (Sonchus asper); chickweed (Stellaria media) Perennials Very difficult (will take long-term strategy or inspired acceptance): Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum); horsetail (Equisetum) Take very seriously (dig up every scrap of root and burn): ground elder (Aegopodium podagraria); bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis, Calystegia sepium); creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens); couch grass (Agropyron repens); lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria) Work at (dig up as and when you can): broad- leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius); nettles (Urtica dioica); spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare); creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense); burdock (Arctium lappa) Handsome (but intrusive): daisy (Bellis perennis); greater celandine (Chelidonium majus); teasel (Dipsacus fullonum); rosebay willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium); hogweed (Heracleum spondylium); dead-nettle (Lamium); alkanet (Pentaglottis sempervirens); mallow (Malva sylvestris); plantain (Plantago major); silverweed (Potentilla anserina); selfheal (Prunella vulgaris); comfrey (Symphytum); feverfew (Tanacetum); dandelion (Taraxacum). My roots: A week in Monty's garden Harry is out on the JCB. I'm anxious, mainly because he is petrified. Harry dug our septic tank 10 years ago, when the garden was no more than a gleam in my eye. It was the first and last time he had ever operated a digger. It will take a couple of days Harry, I say. And more than a couple of Valium, he mutters. I haven't slept all weekend. It's a bit tricky_ You may remember that we flooded last autumn and our septic tank was out of use for three weeks. So we have arranged for another one to be put in, which means digging up a large piece of the garden. To be honest, I had almost forgotten about it, but they turned up yesterday with JCB, dumper and a lorryload of stone. It was like knowing that you had a nagging tooth and coming down to breakfast to find the dentist hovering over your chair, drill ready whirring. Did I say that it has rained all week? That the garden is like a slurry. That even a wheelbarrow is almost impossible to manoeuvre on the grass? So a JCB_ never mind. It must be done. The new bench for the greenhouse has been delivered. It is all aluminium and stainless steel. No soul but we are now seriously smart in the greenhouse department. We don't need this, of course. It is a way of pretending to be more professional and grown-up than we ever are, and the trick works every time I walk in there. Every inch is now laden with seedlings. I made some soil blocks the other day, sowed them with Little Gem lettuce and Mizuna, went off to Birmingham next morning to spend a day filming, came back, and I swear that all had germinated and were sprigged with leaf. Magic. Rather grudgingly I tackled the lesser celandine in the spring garden. There is no joy in this kind of weeding because it has infiltrated nooks and crannies so thoroughly that inevitably precious hellebore seedlings are taken up as you fork, however carefully you do it. It is a real object lesson in weed control, as it should have been tackled properly last year, but as it wasn't too bad I let it go. Fatal. It is the wetness in the spring garden from global warming that has ruined the drainage system, which has meant digging new drains that has upset Harry so much. It's all that George Dubya Bush's fault. I'd get him to come over and remove the celandines and send him penitent back to Kyoto, but Harry says he'd have to do the JCB stuff first. That would sort him.",

      "bodyText": "Former MI5 officer David Shayler yesterday challenged the Government to investigate 'incompetence, malpractice and crime' in the intelligence services and drop all charges against him. Shayler will appear in the High Court in London on Wednesday, charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act. Sources close to the intelligence community this weekend said MI5 was 'desperate to draw a line under the case' but that the trial would almost certainly be pushed back until after the general election. Shayler last night called for a full parliamentary inquiry into his four key revelations that: \u0095 Two foreign intelligence officers, known at PT16 and PT16/B, conspired to assassinate Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. In the failed plot, innocent civilians were killed, he claims. \u0095 The Bishopsgate bombing of April 1993 could have been averted, but MI5 bungling meant that intelligence about the IRA active service unit that carried out the attack was ignored. \u0095 The intelligence services systematically bugged confidential interviews between suspected terrorists and their lawyers at Belmarsh high-security prison. \u0095 Warnings about the bombing of the Israeli embassy in July 1994 were ignored by MI5, leading to the false imprisonment of two Palestinians. 'I'm absolutely convinced that if my disclosures had been investigated and the results made public, it would be untenable to prosecute me now,' Shayler said. He added that the Government would like to see the trial postponed until after the election to minimise embarrassment. Shayler's lawyers will argue that the Official Secrets Act is incompatible with new human rights legislation and the trial could be postponed until spring 2002 if either side takes the judge's decision on the human rights issue to judicial review. The Attorney-General, Lord Williams, has instructed prosecution lawyers to appeal if the decsion goes against them. Home Secretary Jack Straw and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook would both be subpoenaed as witnesses by the defence. Ministers and civil servants agree that the Official Secrets Act needs substantial reform. The battle lines are drawn between the 'doves' who are pushing for a more open American-style system and 'hawks' who want a crackdown, to prevent confidential leaks over the internet. The Intelligence and Security Committee, which oversees the work of the intelligence agencies, has warned Straw that he should strengthen the Official Secrets Act immediately after the election. Its annual report concluded: 'Disclosures are now increasingly being made, sometimes anonymously, on media such as the internet, with no obvious redress by the authorities in the UK.' martin.bright@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>When Marjorie Scardino addresses the annual meeting of Pearson in London's Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre on Friday she may find herself facing something rather unfamiliar: an audience of shareholders increasingly sceptical about her stewardship of the media group. </p> <p>Any doubts early in her tenure that someone whose previous experience included a spell of shrimp fishing and the ownership of a community paper in Georgia would be able to sort out the messy Pearson conglomerate were quickly dispelled. As it turned out, Scardino did everything the City hoped, and more. </p> <p>Her success earned her the nickname of 'Marj in Charge' from respectful Pearson employees. </p> <p>Peripheral assets such as Madame Tussauds and Lazards were dispatched and proceeds were reinvested into the core publishing empire through acquisitions such as Simon &amp; Schuster and NCS, the educational testing business. Circulation of the Financial Times has topped half a million worldwide - trebling to 135,000 in the US - and she is now promising to increase circulation to 750,000 by 2004. </p> <p>The American set herself what looked like unrealistic targets - doubling market value within five years, growing earnings per share by at least 10 per cent a year - and managed to beat them. Her reward was a soaring share price. At their peak 13 months ago the shares had all but quadrupled since the start of her tenure, and she was. crowned First Lady of the FTSE. Recently, however, there have been a few rumbles of dissent. The $2.5 billion paid for NCS looks expensive now that euphoria about e-learning is starting to wane, and that has focused attention on slow growth at the rest of the US educational business. The City is waiting for the first sign that advertising revenue at the Financial Times, Economist and the group's other newspapers and magazines is being hit by the global slowdown. </p> <p>The share price has fallen sharply, but some think it is still overvalued. 'There are considerable risks to forecasts,' one institutional investor said. 'And we are concerned that they have overpaid for acquisitions.' </p> <p>Above all, there is ft.com. Scathing articles under headlines like 'FTDot Bomb' have appeared in publications from the Spectator to London's Evening Standard questioning whether it can ever make the electronic version of the FT pay. There is much speculation about job cuts and closure of some parts of the site, which continues even after the recent cut backs. </p> <p>Then there has been the speculation about Scardino herself. There have been persistent and, the company insists, unfounded rumours that she is about to head back to her native America. One even suggested that she was about to join the Bush administration - apparently ignorant of the fact that she is a fully paid-up Democrat. </p> <p>Pearson's riposte to concerns about ft.com is detailed right. In essence the case for ft.com rests on its ability to grow income from areas that hardly exist, let alone have any measurable historic trends, such as supplying data to wap telephones and selling specialist company searches. Pearson's justification for the price it paid for NCS rests on similarly unquantifiable claims. </p> <p>NCS is the leading supplier of software services to schools, which do everything from count the number of absentees to showing children's grades.It has products in almost half of all US schools. Finance director John Makinson believes the big opportunity is to use these links to 'personalise learning' for individual pupils by integrating the teaching programmes with monitoring and assessment. </p> <p>Pearson believes the business will also benefit from the educational reforms proposed by President Bush, including a commitment to introducing regular testing of all students. At the moment, only eight US states comply with Bush's plans and, as the leading supplier of testing systems, NCS could be a big beneficiary. </p> <p>That is a lot of 'ifs'. Makinson is convinced the acquisition will prove itself and he points out that NCS had a strong growth record before Pearson bought it. </p> <p>But the $2.5 billion price represented three times NCS' revenues. To justify that, it has to do far more than just maintain growth. It has to demonstrate that it can establish NCS as the internet platform for schools, and that it can build on that to sell other products and services. </p> <p>For the moment, the City seems prepared to trust Scardino to do that.

      "bodyText": "When Marjorie Scardino addresses the annual meeting of Pearson in London's Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre on Friday she may find herself facing something rather unfamiliar: an audience of shareholders increasingly sceptical about her stewardship of the media group. Any doubts early in her tenure that someone whose previous experience included a spell of shrimp fishing and the ownership of a community paper in Georgia would be able to sort out the messy Pearson conglomerate were quickly dispelled. As it turned out, Scardino did everything the City hoped, and more. Her success earned her the nickname of 'Marj in Charge' from respectful Pearson employees. Peripheral assets such as Madame Tussauds and Lazards were dispatched and proceeds were reinvested into the core publishing empire through acquisitions such as Simon &amp; Schuster and NCS, the educational testing business. Circulation of the Financial Times has topped half a million worldwide - trebling to 135,000 in the US - and she is now promising to increase circulation to 750,000 by 2004. The American set herself what looked like unrealistic targets - doubling market value within five years, growing earnings per share by at least 10 per cent a year - and managed to beat them. Her reward was a soaring share price. At their peak 13 months ago the shares had all but quadrupled since the start of her tenure, and she was. crowned First Lady of the FTSE. Recently, however, there have been a few rumbles of dissent. The $2.5 billion paid for NCS looks expensive now that euphoria about e-learning is starting to wane, and that has focused attention on slow growth at the rest of the US educational business. The City is waiting for the first sign that advertising revenue at the Financial Times, Economist and the group's other newspapers and magazines is being hit by the global slowdown. The share price has fallen sharply, but some think it is still overvalued. 'There are considerable risks to forecasts,' one institutional investor said. 'And we are concerned that they have overpaid for acquisitions.' Above all, there is ft.com. Scathing articles under headlines like 'FTDot Bomb' have appeared in publications from the Spectator to London's Evening Standard questioning whether it can ever make the electronic version of the FT pay. There is much speculation about job cuts and closure of some parts of the site, which continues even after the recent cut backs. Then there has been the speculation about Scardino herself. There have been persistent and, the company insists, unfounded rumours that she is about to head back to her native America. One even suggested that she was about to join the Bush administration - apparently ignorant of the fact that she is a fully paid-up Democrat. Pearson's riposte to concerns about ft.com is detailed right. In essence the case for ft.com rests on its ability to grow income from areas that hardly exist, let alone have any measurable historic trends, such as supplying data to wap telephones and selling specialist company searches. Pearson's justification for the price it paid for NCS rests on similarly unquantifiable claims. NCS is the leading supplier of software services to schools, which do everything from count the number of absentees to showing children's grades.It has products in almost half of all US schools. Finance director John Makinson believes the big opportunity is to use these links to 'personalise learning' for individual pupils by integrating the teaching programmes with monitoring and assessment. Pearson believes the business will also benefit from the educational reforms proposed by President Bush, including a commitment to introducing regular testing of all students. At the moment, only eight US states comply with Bush's plans and, as the leading supplier of testing systems, NCS could be a big beneficiary. That is a lot of 'ifs'. Makinson is convinced the acquisition will prove itself and he points out that NCS had a strong growth record before Pearson bought it. But the $2.5 billion price represented three times NCS' revenues. To justify that, it has to do far more than just maintain growth. It has to demonstrate that it can establish NCS as the internet platform for schools, and that it can build on that to sell other products and services. For the moment, the City seems prepared to trust Scardino to do that. 'I still regard the management team very highly,' said one large shareholder. Both Pearson and Scardino have been anxious to avoid a cult of personality - so much so that she rarely does interviews. But there is little doubt that she is heavily identified with the contentious issues. The performance of NCS and ft.com over the coming 12 months will do much to determine the atmosphere at next year's annual meeting.

While not exactly 'faking it', because he would create his own works of art, he would attempt to convince three experts that he was a genuine professional at the end of a month of training. </p> <p>O'Hare confessed he did not understand what abstract art 'was for'. 'I know what it is. I just don't agree with it,' he told the Slade-trained artist Laura Godfrey Isaacs, who was charged with the task of turning O'Hare into a credible fake. </p> <p>She took him to see the work of other young artists at an annual contemporary art show held in North London, but he remained nonplussed.

Starting with self-portraits, O'Hare quickly moved on to monotype prints, made by tracing a simple image on to glass.

At an art world party his work was praised by a guest from the Victoria and Albert Museum. His images, she said, reminded her of Rembrandt's work 'with just a hint of ancientness'. </p> <p>O'Hare approached his final judgment day with the same nerves he felt on his wedding day. His work was to appear along side four other professional abstract artists; Nigel Love, who has a commission for a \u00a33,500 work from a Labour MP, the award-winning Ollie Beck, Shane Bradford, a former Chelsea Art School student whose work sells for \u00a35,000, and Richard Bartle, whose works were recently bought for the chic London hotel, One Aldwych. </p> <p>When the critics asked Paul to explain his inspiration, he simply said 'I had a bit of a rough trot when I was a child,' but they seemed happy.

      "body": "<p>Americans take everything seriously - even fun. Which explains why no one was surprised at the news that Anne Robinson, acid-tongued presenter of The Weakest Link, is under 24-hour protection in the United States. It may be a wicked publicity stunt concocted by NBC, which imported the infamous quiz show, but it sounds all too plausible in the land of the irony-free. Anne's special brew of the public put-down and the humiliating hectoring drew 15 million viewers to the show's debut last Monday. But it's also already turned her into a hate figure whom trigger-happy sickos could target as fair game. </p> <p>Ms Robinson taunts her quiz show contestants for being ignorant, lazy or simply hopelessly stupid. This bullying may be as British as steak-and-kidney pie, but it is not the American Way. You humiliate an American - even the meekest mildest of nerds - at your peril: the cowed nail biter who stammers all the wrong answers could boast a little arsenal at home and his revenge explodes in a machine gun massacre: 'You're the weakest link, Anne. Goodbye.' Even among 'healthy' Americans, who will not fantasise about giving Ms Robinson a knuckle-sandwich, her breed of contempt provokes anger ('snippy British snob' according to the Washington Post ) rather than amusement. </p> <p>In Britain, The Weakest Link could bank on our cultural acceptance of humiliation. Like a fierce nanny, the quiz mistress preyed on the snivelling creatures before her: nothing they said was good enough, nothing they did was right, and nothing was ever private (not even bowel movements: 'Show me your potty' was one English friend's red-faced memory of his nanny). This bludgeoning of the self-esteem is expected as a matter of course: from public schools to Parliament, from sitcoms to stand-up-comics, the national character is molded by reciprocal scorn. Policies are made, laws drawn up, campaigns waged through an exchange of abuse. On these shores, 'taking yourself too seriously' is the worst insult; being branded as earnest, the social kiss of death. </p> <p>It's only natural. With the loss of empire and the shrinking of cultural exports to the World Service and a handful of novelists, British self-importance would invite international ridicule. Like a bit of fluff caught reading a book upside down, Britain wants to pose as one half of a special relationship, but is forever being caught on all fours, in servile prostration before Uncle Sam. </p> <p>Servility, instead, is alien to the Yank (though black slavery of course was a way of life only a few generations ago). Bossy boots translates as ball-breaking bitch there; public knuckle-rapping is tantamount to Saudi stone-casting. From the first day at school, when he mouths his pledge of allegiance to the flag, every American child is reared in the knowledge that everyone's equal under that Star-Spangled Banner. 'I won't take shit from no one' is the macho message in nearly every Hollywood movie; and the point is driven home in every school shooting, where the bullied settle the score. </p> <p>Americans don't like humble pie: they regard themselves - collectively and individually - as Number One; and they approach their selves, their countrymen, and every institution with a corresponding degree of seriousness. History, economics and geopolitics have schooled them in self-importance: every little thing they say, every little thing they do, has worldwide implications. When Americans slip on a banana skin, the rest of the world breaks its legs. Conscious of their global role, Yanks uphold this earnest ethos. </p> <p>Compare a debate in the House of Representatives with one in the House of Commons. In an atmosphere of yawn-making gravitas, Congressmen deliberate with sonorous pomposity and confront one another with serious accusations based on past records. MPs, on the other hand, jeer and poke fun, trade insults with the puerile enthusiasm of schoolboys. I still remember the outrage an American friend of mine expressed when Have I Got News For You turned a tub of lard into a stand-in for Roy Hattersley. 'Don't you guys take anything seriously?' he shouted in disgust at what he considered the demeaning of democracy. </p> <p>His reaction explains why 'You laughing at me?' is a De Niroesque threat, not a harmless question, across the Atlantic. Humour at someone's expense (especially your own) is subversive, sinister stuff. Those who dare practise it - Woody Allen and Steve Martin - win plaudits from fans on the fringe (and in Allen's case outside the country) but never win over the people's hearts. As for the late Lenny Bruce, whose repertoire consisted of hard-hitting jibes at the establishment, the stand up comedian had his phones tapped by the CIA and received death threats after almost every performance. The lesson was clear: you can't laugh at Uncle Sam without incurring his wrath. </p> <p>Their Cold War role as Superpower entrenched Americans in their humourless ways. Laugh at someone, and you expose their weakness: in inconsequential Britain, this may pass as a character-building rite of passage; but in the nation that protected us from the Evil Empire, it could lead to World War III. A safe world needed a self-confident US of A: so no lip from you, smart-ass. </p> <p>Today, the Cold War has only partially thawed - the Chinese dragon may ultimately prove as dangerous as the Russian Bear. And so there is really no reason for Americans to lighten up. Beware, Ms Robinson: your new audience is dead serious about just about everything. Especially themselves. </p> <p> Cristina Odone is Deputy Editor of the New Statesman</p>",

When Americans slip on a banana skin, the rest of the world breaks its legs. Conscious of their global role, Yanks uphold this earnest ethos. Compare a debate in the House of Representatives with one in the House of Commons. In an atmosphere of yawn-making gravitas, Congressmen deliberate with sonorous pomposity and confront one another with serious accusations based on past records. MPs, on the other hand, jeer and poke fun, trade insults with the puerile enthusiasm of schoolboys. I still remember the outrage an American friend of mine expressed when Have I Got News For You turned a tub of lard into a stand-in for Roy Hattersley. 'Don't you guys take anything seriously?' he shouted in disgust at what he considered the demeaning of democracy. His reaction explains why 'You laughing at me?' is a De Niroesque threat, not a harmless question, across the Atlantic. Humour at someone's expense (especially your own) is subversive, sinister stuff. Those who dare practise it - Woody Allen and Steve Martin - win plaudits from fans on the fringe (and in Allen's case outside the country) but never win over the people's hearts. As for the late Lenny Bruce, whose repertoire consisted of hard-hitting jibes at the establishment, the stand up comedian had his phones tapped by the CIA and received death threats after almost every performance. The lesson was clear: you can't laugh at Uncle Sam without incurring his wrath. Their Cold War role as Superpower entrenched Americans in their humourless ways. Laugh at someone, and you expose their weakness: in inconsequential Britain, this may pass as a character-building rite of passage; but in the nation that protected us from the Evil Empire, it could lead to World War III. A safe world needed a self-confident US of A: so no lip from you, smart-ass. Today, the Cold War has only partially thawed - the Chinese dragon may ultimately prove as dangerous as the Russian Bear. And so there is really no reason for Americans to lighten up. Beware, Ms Robinson: your new audience is dead serious about just about everything. Especially themselves.

      "body": "<p>Is Hollywood actually capable of saying sorry? It seems unlikely, but saying sorry to the Chinese for the sorry treatment of Oriental actors over the years would seem to be a good idea right now. </p> <p>Following the unprecedented success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, American producers have signed up a host of Asian stars aiming to introduce them to multiplexes around the world. There's Rush Hour 2, a couple of big-budget Jet Li movies and a number of intriguing Chow Yun-Fat projects. Meanwhile, Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, the people who made Crouching Tiger, are working on four Chinese-set US-backed movies, with Donald Sutherland in Beijing shooting the comedy, Big Shot's Funeral, directed by Feng Xiaogang, with Hong Kong star Tony Leung (In the Mood for Love) playing a Taiwanese detective in the thriller, Double Vision. The Chinese (whether Hong Kong, Taiwanese, mainland or homegrown) presence in the US movie industry has never been more substantial. </p> <p>Which is why it might be wise for Hollywood to repent about how Charlie Chan was played by men with names like Sidney Toler and Warner Oland, apologise for the old yellow-peril movies and most of all, the day David Carradine was chosen over Bruce Lee to star in the TV series Kung Fu. The time has come to say sorry that Nancy Kwan, who became a star in the 1960's The World Of Suzie Wong, ran out of decent parts so quickly. </p> <p>And Hollywood could find a word or two of regret about the attitudes that made silent star Anna May Wong leave town in 1928, announcing: 'I was tired of the parts I had to play. Why is it that on the screen the Chinese are nearly always the villain of the piece, and so cruel a villain - murderous, treacher ous, a snake in the grass? We are not like that. How could we be, with a civilisation so many times older than that of the West? We have our rigid code of behaviour, of honour. Why do they never show those on the screen?' </p> <p>The movie industry is not going to apologise for the sake of its conscience, of course. It is just that, as with the Latin American craze in recent years, it is clear there is money to be made from the domestic Asian-American market, and much more from the huge south-east Asian market. </p> <p>Making movies that play on both sides of the Pacific is the purpose behind Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia. But Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was the climax to a long, slow struggle, mainly by veterans of the Hong Kong movie industry. Thirty years ago, San Francisco-born, University of Washington-educated Bruce Lee had to leave LA and go to Hong Kong to become a film star. Only now is the reverse trip becoming more frequent. The youngest member of the Crouching Tiger cast, Zhang Ziyi, has been snapped up to play a villain in Rush Hour 2. And because her English isn't up to much, her part will be subtitled. Times have changed. </p> <p>The advance, though, has been glacier-like at times. It is only since 1998's Rush Hour that Jackie Chan, who, for two decades, had been a megastar not only across south-east Asia, but in India, and much of the rest of the world, finally cracked the big time in the US. Li, the other leading martial-arts star, has moved faster, having gone from villain in his first US movie (Lethal Weapon 4) to romantic lead in his second (Romeo Must Die). </p> <p>'Jet Li got a deal with Warner Bros because women in test audiences loved him in Lethal Weapon 4,' according to producer Chris Lee. 'You'll definitely be seeing more of the Asian male as romantic hero, instead of just gun-wielding villain or sexless geek.' </p> <p>One reason it hasn't been easy is that since the Second World War, all foreign stars have struggled in Hollywood. Think of the brief US careers of non-American stars like G\u00e9rard Depardieu or even Sophia Loren. The few who have made it - Antonio Banderas or Chan - have done so with huge determination and over time. Most, faced with indifferent reactions to indifferent movies, have gone home. </p> <p>Some Chinese stars are convinced it is that much harder for them, with attitudes in the United States little changed Anna May Wong's day. 'At the parties, people are nice, but below the surface you feel the tension,' says Leslie Cheung, leading man in dozens of Hong Kong hits. </p> <p>When Hong Kong's most famous director, John Woo, arrived in Hollywood, he didn't bring his stars with him, choosing instead to establish himself by working with John Travolta and Tom Cruise. Those who have made it to the US have found that working habits are different too. Until recently, many Hong Kong films were shot silently, so that both Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue could be dubbed on afterwards. The films are made quickly there; stars can make up to 12 a year. And despite the century and a half of British colonial rule, many Hong Kong stars, including Chan, when he first arrived in the US, don't speak much English. Add up those factors and you can see why some suggest the chief beneficiaries of the Asian awakening will be US-born actors like Lucy Liu. </p> <p>Still, the economic imperative works on both sides of the Pacific. The Hong Kong film industry, so strong in the late Eighties and early Nineties, had a bad end of the century. 'You can see the Hong Kong market right now is dying,' said Chow Yun-Fat in 1998. 'That's why I have to move, to look for a new way to support my career in the future.' </p> <p>Fortunately, as Chow has established himself in Hollywood, the power balance has finally shifted.

      "bodyText": "Is Hollywood actually capable of saying sorry? It seems unlikely, but saying sorry to the Chinese for the sorry treatment of Oriental actors over the years would seem to be a good idea right now. Following the unprecedented success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, American producers have signed up a host of Asian stars aiming to introduce them to multiplexes around the world. There's Rush Hour 2, a couple of big-budget Jet Li movies and a number of intriguing Chow Yun-Fat projects. Meanwhile, Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, the people who made Crouching Tiger, are working on four Chinese-set US-backed movies, with Donald Sutherland in Beijing shooting the comedy, Big Shot's Funeral, directed by Feng Xiaogang, with Hong Kong star Tony Leung (In the Mood for Love) playing a Taiwanese detective in the thriller, Double Vision. The Chinese (whether Hong Kong, Taiwanese, mainland or homegrown) presence in the US movie industry has never been more substantial. Which is why it might be wise for Hollywood to repent about how Charlie Chan was played by men with names like Sidney Toler and Warner Oland, apologise for the old yellow-peril movies and most of all, the day David Carradine was chosen over Bruce Lee to star in the TV series Kung Fu. The time has come to say sorry that Nancy Kwan, who became a star in the 1960's The World Of Suzie Wong, ran out of decent parts so quickly. And Hollywood could find a word or two of regret about the attitudes that made silent star Anna May Wong leave town in 1928, announcing: 'I was tired of the parts I had to play. Why is it that on the screen the Chinese are nearly always the villain of the piece, and so cruel a villain - murderous, treacher ous, a snake in the grass? We are not like that. How could we be, with a civilisation so many times older than that of the West? We have our rigid code of behaviour, of honour. Why do they never show those on the screen?' The movie industry is not going to apologise for the sake of its conscience, of course. It is just that, as with the Latin American craze in recent years, it is clear there is money to be made from the domestic Asian-American market, and much more from the huge south-east Asian market. Making movies that play on both sides of the Pacific is the purpose behind Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia. But Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was the climax to a long, slow struggle, mainly by veterans of the Hong Kong movie industry. Thirty years ago, San Francisco-born, University of Washington-educated Bruce Lee had to leave LA and go to Hong Kong to become a film star. Only now is the reverse trip becoming more frequent. The youngest member of the Crouching Tiger cast, Zhang Ziyi, has been snapped up to play a villain in Rush Hour 2. And because her English isn't up to much, her part will be subtitled. Times have changed. The advance, though, has been glacier-like at times. It is only since 1998's Rush Hour that Jackie Chan, who, for two decades, had been a megastar not only across south-east Asia, but in India, and much of the rest of the world, finally cracked the big time in the US. Li, the other leading martial-arts star, has moved faster, having gone from villain in his first US movie (Lethal Weapon 4) to romantic lead in his second (Romeo Must Die). 'Jet Li got a deal with Warner Bros because women in test audiences loved him in Lethal Weapon 4,' according to producer Chris Lee. 'You'll definitely be seeing more of the Asian male as romantic hero, instead of just gun-wielding villain or sexless geek.' One reason it hasn't been easy is that since the Second World War, all foreign stars have struggled in Hollywood. Think of the brief US careers of non-American stars like G\u00e9rard Depardieu or even Sophia Loren. The few who have made it - Antonio Banderas or Chan - have done so with huge determination and over time. Most, faced with indifferent reactions to indifferent movies, have gone home. Some Chinese stars are convinced it is that much harder for them, with attitudes in the United States little changed Anna May Wong's day. 'At the parties, people are nice, but below the surface you feel the tension,' says Leslie Cheung, leading man in dozens of Hong Kong hits. When Hong Kong's most famous director, John Woo, arrived in Hollywood, he didn't bring his stars with him, choosing instead to establish himself by working with John Travolta and Tom Cruise. Those who have made it to the US have found that working habits are different too. Until recently, many Hong Kong films were shot silently, so that both Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue could be dubbed on afterwards. The films are made quickly there; stars can make up to 12 a year. And despite the century and a half of British colonial rule, many Hong Kong stars, including Chan, when he first arrived in the US, don't speak much English. Add up those factors and you can see why some suggest the chief beneficiaries of the Asian awakening will be US-born actors like Lucy Liu. Still, the economic imperative works on both sides of the Pacific. The Hong Kong film industry, so strong in the late Eighties and early Nineties, had a bad end of the century. 'You can see the Hong Kong market right now is dying,' said Chow Yun-Fat in 1998. 'That's why I have to move, to look for a new way to support my career in the future.' Fortunately, as Chow has established himself in Hollywood, the power balance has finally shifted. Michelle Yeoh and Li felt comfortable enough to both turn down roles in The Matrix sequels, Yeoh having been passed over in favour of Carrie-Anne Moss in the original movie. And Chow, who before Crouching Tiger had already gained the true Hollywood seal of approval - starring opposite Jodie Foster in Anna and the King - is trying to rewrite a bit of that bitter history by developing a new Charlie Chan film. Although Jackie Chan is the biggest Chinese star right now, and the younger and more handsome Li is closing in fast, Chow might be the biggest star in the long run: as he's not a martial-arts' artist, he doesn't have to worry about his battered body giving up on him. He has also stretched himself far beyond the two-gunned John Woo thrillers which made him famous in the West. It might not last, but right now, the Crouching Tiger effect is very strong. 'For me, it was a long time coming and it was just so thrilling every time they announced a Chinese name and pronounced it right,' said ER 's Ming-Na on Oscar night. Even when the frenzy subsides, there will will be no going back to the days of the Warner Bros memo re Kung Fu, which read: 'The American public won't sit for a Chinaman appearing in their living-rooms every week.'",

The title gave a deadly twist to a children's playground game and when, more than two decades later, he chose to make his hero a genuine clothier, he gave the novel a deceptively innocent title reminiscent of childhood and Beatrix Potter, The Tailor of Panama. </p> <p>One doubts if he was consciously thinking of Graham Greene's celebrated, semi-satirical essay on Potter's fiction in which he dismissed the eponymous hero of The Tailor of Gloucester as 'ineffective and too virtuous'. Without doubt, however, le Carr\u00e9 had Our Man in Havana in mind, as he says in his acknowledgements. </p> <p>Like Greene's novel, The Tailor of Panama is about a British expatriate in an unstable Latin American country put under pressure by British intelligence and inventing, with lethal consequences, a non-existent spy ring and a fictitious political conspiracy. Le Carr\u00e9's fine book is nearly twice the length of Greene's, denser and less funny, but the movie, of which he is co-scriptwriter with Andrew Davies and director John Boorman, is far superior to, and much tougher than, the film Greene made of Our Man in Havana with Carol Reed in 1960. </p> <p>Le Carr\u00e9's equivalents of Jim Wormold, the vacuum-cleaner salesman, and Hawthorne, the very establishment MI6 agent (the characters played by Alec Guinness and No\u00ebl Coward in Our Man in Havana) are Harry Pendel (so well played by Geoffrey Rush), the Panama City bespoke tailor, and Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan), the maverick MI6 operative who's been posted to the backwater of the Panama embassy as punishment for troublemaking. </p> <p>Although the comic intrigue in Greene's novel anticipated both the success of Castro's revolution (which followed the book's publication by a few months) and, quite uncannily, the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, Wormold and Hawthorne are figures from farce. Pendel and Osnard have a much greater weight and are altogether, on first acquaintance, less genial. </p> <p>Both men are frauds and self-deceivers, but their fraudulence and self-deception have a larger political dimension, as we appreciate during the witty courtship between tailor and spy with which the film opens. Pendel, the working-class Londoner who learnt his tailoring in jail, poses as an established Savile Row master and dispenses old- world class to the unscrupulous rich and nouveaux riches of Panama. The spirit of Benny, his late Jewish uncle (an amusing turn by Harold Pinter), hovers over his shoulder giving dubious advice, but Pendel really believes in the snobbish standards and outmoded Englishness that he has espoused. </p> <p>Osnard, who has seen through Pendel's fa\u00e7ade, works for an organisation that, in the post-imperial, post-Cold War world, has become largely redundant. He pretends that Britain has a major role in the world, if one dependent for intelligence operations on US subventions, but his growing cynicism has turned him into an opportunist. When he seduces Pendel - with money and blackmail - into becoming an agent, he wants to believe in 'the silent opposition' of local liberals that the tailor invents, and in a non-existent clandestine scheme to sell the Panama Canal to a Chinese, French and Japanese consortium. </p> <p>The difference between the two is that Pendel is essentially a decent man, real concern underlying his subservience, while Osnard exists in a moral vacuum. The truly good person, however, is Pendel's American wife, Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis), a representative of the reality principle. She respects the recently appointed Panamanian executives of the canal company for which she works, and stands in sharp contrast to her half-demented fellow-countrymen plotting against them in the Pentagon. </p> <p>The film is given a firm sense of reality through the confident handling of authentic locations by Boorman, who has worked in Latin America before in The Emerald Forest and, more recently, in a politically volatile state in Beyond Rangoon. There is no excessive use of local colour and the background is integrated into the dramatic action. Boorman directs with a light touch of a sort that was only to be seen intermittently in his work before his last movie, The General, about the Irish gangster, Martin Cahill. Brendan Gleeson, so superb as Cahill, here immerses himself in the role of a burnt-out ex-revolutionary who becomes Pendel's chief fall guy. </p> <p>The cleverest trick, which adds to the humour and excitement, as well as underlining the film's meaning, is the casting of Pierce Brosnan, who's never been so good. When he is briefed at MI6's Thamesside HQ by a bland superior, his eyes twinkle evilly at the prospect of easy pickings in corrupt Panama, and we realise that this is a different organisation from that last bastion of patriotism served by James Bond. There have been supposed anti-Bonds on the screen before, but here we have the most confident embodiment of Bond since Connery's day serving himself rather than Her Majesty. </p> <p>Osnard is suave in the manner of a student of Playboy ;his only piece of advanced technology is a Zippo containing a miniature camera; as a lover, he's violent, sweaty and not irresistible, and his word is not his bond.

But you can't help respecting O'Farrell's undying devotion to a party that squatted for 6,532 days in the shadows of a Conservative government. Throughout this witty and entertaining audiobook, O'Farrell portrays himself as the Labour Party personified, from his militant rantings as a campaigner witnessing the first flush of electoral apathy - 'They could abolish the right to vote, trial by jury, the right to free speech, as long as they didn't change the theme tune to The Archers' - to the realisation that, although Tony Blair isn't strictly the leftie that die-hard Labour supporters had been looking for, he was nearer to what O'Farrell had become himself by the time Tony ended 18 years of Tory rule. 'Do what you have to do, Tony,' says the voice of New O'Farrell. The irony of these observations is doubly effective in being spoken by the author himself, and although not all writers do their own work justice, no one could do a better job of driving home the reasons for never voting Conservative again: 'Think David Mellor, Neil Hamilton, Tim Smith, Steven Norris.' Need he say more?",

      "body": "<p>It's almost tempting to think of Jake Arnott as a photofit novelist, a figure Shaw Taylor might have pieced together - 'Have you seen this man?' - from a publisher's sketchy brief. His second book, a stylish crime narrative concerned with the moral legacy of Flying Squad corruption in Sixties London, comes complete with a charge sheet of its author's 'previous', for which any self-respecting editor would probably have offered several holdalls of used tenners, regardless of the manuscript. </p> <p>The writer, we are told, has worked as a 'mortuary technician, a theatrical agent, an artist's life model, an actor and a sign-language interpreter... during the Eighties, he lived in various squats, one of which burned down, leaving him possessionless and under arrest on suspicion of arson... his last acting job was as the Mummy in Universal Pictures blockbuster The Mummy - though you won't recognise him through the bandages...' All that before he ever picked up a pen. </p> <p>Uncharitably, there have been those who have suggested that it is largely because of this hard-sold outlaw mythology, allied to what one reviewer was moved to describe as 'brute-boy' good looks, that Arnott has jumped to the front of the queue of bankable, youngish literary novelists. This perception was fuelled by a BBC documentary on fiction debutants that gave Arnott's entry into the world of letters something of the breathless trajectory of the Craig David song: sent off his manuscript on Friday, called by his agent on Monday, lined up a 'substantial six-figure deal' on Tuesday, booked a photo-shoot on Wednesday, invented a genre - 'geezer chic' - on Thursday, been chilling ever since. </p> <p>In fact, of course, there is no such thing as an overnight literary success. Arnott had been writing for seven years pretty much full time, living on nothing in Leeds, before he got any kind of break. He'd completed an earlier manuscript ('My great squat novel,' he says, smiling. 'It had the word \"crepuscular\" in the second paragraph') which collected a neat stack of rejection slips, and he was pushing 40 when his book came out. </p> <p>He is reluctant to suggest that the subsequent hype did much to propel The Long Firm on to the bestseller lists, either: 'Perhaps the saving grace of publishing,' he says, bright eyed and hesitantly spoken, 'is that even with the greatest amount of publicity possible, it's not really going to impinge on the general population in any way at all. It's not like being in a boy band. People aren't that interested in authors really. Any book has to sell itself.' </p> <p>The Long Firm did just that. An inspired reaction to the heritage industry of East End organised crime, it trained the sawn-off conventions of a gangster novel on received notions of masculinity. The book tells the story of one Harry Starks, a gay Soho racketeer with a taste for cultural studies and stage-managed menaces. Starks was loosely based on Ronnie Kray, with a dash of Macheath, the aspirational villain of Brecht's Threepenny Opera, thrown in. </p> <p>As soon as he started writing it, Arnott knew he was on to something: a way of getting at the particular male anxieties that begin to tell the story of Englishness in the latter part of the twentieth century. 'I did the whole book,' he says. 'with a kind of pressing fear that someone would beat me to it and write about Ronnie Kray and his boyfriends, because it was such a wonderful, obvious story.' </p> <p>He suggests that, in a way, Quentin Tarantino had started the trend 'with this very homosocial lads kind of movie, in which everyone is scared of being \"bottom\", everyone literally watching their arse', but suggests, too, that he wanted to come at 'that kind of fetishised masculinity from a different angle. Obviously, some people might read my books for exactly that masculinity: fast moving, lots of violence, and so on, but I think there is a little more going on, too.' </p> <p>As it turned out, Arnott also pre-empted the latest bout of gangland nostalgia that attended Guy Ritchie's film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He finds it vaguely amusing that he and Ritchie have sometimes been lumped together at the vanguard of a revivalist British trend. </p> <p>'In, say, Lock, Stock, you come away thinking essentially this is a feel-good gangster movie,' he says, distancing himself from the idea. 'I mean, my idea of film noir is that there should be at least a little bit of noir about it. The great examples of the genre show how the individual is brought down by society, the great American tragedy if you like. You shouldn't come away just thinking: that was fun. Gangsters can't simply succeed.' </p> <p>In some ways, Jake Arnott is well placed to comment on the particular merits of 'failure' in a man's life. Having done wilfully little to live up to his management consultant father's aspirations for him at the boys' grammar school in Aylesbury, he left at 16 and tried a variety of ill-fitting worlds for size. Looking back, he says, giggling a little at the idea, 'National Service might have done me some good, anything tangible really.' </p> <p>Instead, he found himself living in a series of London squats and working in the mortuary at University College Hospital. 'My main duty was to clean the vast dissection-room floor first thing in the morning,' he recalls, 'with about 150 bodies on these glass-topped trolleys. If you'd filmed it from the top with stop action, it would have been this strange Busby Berkeley scene. I'd often sing show tunes with the embalmer Kay, from Walthamstow, and I did learn how to embalm a body, so that was useful, in a way.' </p> <p>This Damien Hirst fantasy came at a time in his life when, he says - chirpily - he was 'disturbed and depressed and I think still trying to sort out lots of things in myself. I came out as bisexual in my twenties, still had girlfriends and it was all, you know, mad flux. Looking back, I'm glad there was all that to work through, because there's nothing left to worry about now, nothing at all'. </p> <p>Some of those happily resolved conflicts resurface in different guises in his novels, he admits, but he rejects the notion of himself as a 'gay writer'. </p> <p>'I suppose I've always felt that an identity solely based on sexuality is a bit depressing anyway,' he says. 'In the Eighties, it was a slightly too political thing; now, even worse, it's become a marketing niche.' </p> <p>The person who did most to help Arnott through his period of doubt was his paternal grandmother who lived in Clapham and who had worked in the West End as a dancer for most of her life (Arnott's father had done his own rebelling by moving to Buckinghamshire). She was the first person Arnott talked with about his sexuality: 'As a dancer, she knew so many. But also because I knew she would have an honest reaction to it. It's difficult for the parents anyway. That pressure to say the right thing. But she had no qualms.' </p> <p>In return, his grandmother always told him vivid stories about her time on the Soho stage and these tales became the root of his fascination with the role in that world of the mob, a fascination which led to the preoccupations of The Long Firm. </p> <p>'I was interested in the kind of theatricality that attends violence,' he says. 'If part of your job is to have this profile of menace, you need that front of artifice. Gangsters often talk about \"shaping up\" before they get into a fight. I remember John McVicar suggesting how good he had been in going through that kind of performance. And, of course, there is a long history of villains sending their children to stage school.' </p> <p>Arnott's career on the stage, also partly inspired by his grandmother's example, was less dramatic than it might have been. Throughout the Eighties, he picked up bits of work, 'improvisational stuff, all very obscure and underpaid', and subsequently became involved with Red Ladder, a theatre company in Leeds. 'I think it was socialist-feminist, though it might have been the other way round,' he says. </p> <p>His acting was one aspect of an unfocused political involvement - 'endless marches, demos, meetings' - that came with life in the squatted houses and warehouses of south London. </p> <p>It was that period of Arnott's life which provided the genesis for his second novel. On one march in the early Eighties, he heard a chant, borrowed from the football terraces, used by Class War to goad the police: 'Harry Roberts is our friend/ is our friend/ is our friend/ he kills coppers'. The chant - 'something eerie about it, like a malevolent nursery rhyme' - referred to the infamous murder of three Met officers in 1966.</p> <p>Over the years, the words haunted Arnott as 'emblematic of all that working-class-hero nonsense, typical of the anarchists, who wanted to seem butch and bold' and when he came to research the real story of Harry Roberts, a man with a grudge, a veteran of the colonial conflict in Malaya, 'a kind of Travis Bickle', it led him into a tale of three decades of corruption on both sides of the law. </p> <p>Roberts is reinvented in He Kills Coppers as Billy Porter, and through a series of smart connections, Arnott also succeeds in recreating the world into which he emerged. Some of these links were chance encounters: 1966 obviously led him to football - his book addresses the implications of the 'great national bonding moment' that was the World Cup victory - and while he was researching that he came across a London Evening Standard clipping that tied in a CID operation to the beautiful game: Nipper Read leading a clean-up iniative on Soho clip-joints for the duration of the tournament. </p> <p>'It was like the opening scene of Measure for Measure,' he says. 'You know where the Duke charges Angelo to clean up the city and, of course, those supposed to be sorting things out get corrupted themselves.' </p> <p>Arnott is slightly concerned that his book goes over some of this contentious ground at a time when Harry Roberts, who has been in prison for 34 years, is coming up for release. 'He's awaiting a parole board, I believe,' he says, guardedly. 'He's in open conditions. I have to be careful because I don't want to get caught up in any of that debate. Although, of course, as soon as soon as I mentioned in passing to my publisher that Roberts might be paroled this year, their eyes were going round in their heads.' </p> <p>The case also provided Arnott with a way of exploring some of his own past, in that he uses the folkloric 'Harry Roberts, he's our friend' idea to satirise the 'easy radicalism' of the Eighties. 'I'm very cruel about the kind of person I was then, I suppose,' he says now. 'The chant itself sort of encapsulated everything I hated about the anarchist movement. I just got sick of the fact that in every squat there would be this inevitable all-inclusive debate about everything - racism, class war, sexuality - brought into discussions about whether you were going to have a washing-up rota. People would always label you a fascist if you argued that there should be one,' he laughs. 'You know, that kind of thing.' </p> <p>The point at which Arnott realised that the revolution probably wasn't going to happen was when he helped to organise support for the miners in 1985. 'A women's group came down from South Yorkshire to thank us,' he remembers, 'and, of course, they had dressed up for the occasion. And they walked into this place, this squatters' caf\u00e9, and you could see the look on their faces, like, \"Fucking hell, they're sending us food\". And I suddenly just thought this was just so ridiculous, like pretending we were in nineteenth-century Poland or something.' </p> <p>How Arnott got from there to here is the stuff of publisher's blurbs. He now owns a flat on Islington's Upper Street in north London and is amused by the fact that the lifestyle he once enjoyed for nothing - playing Changing Rooms in empty warehouses - is now the expensive aspiration of City bankers and way beyond his vaunted 'substantial six figure' means. Still, he's not complaining. He has just signed another two-book deal with his publisher and is waiting for a script of The Long Firm to be worked up into a TV series by Joe Penhall, the author of the National Theatre hit Blue/Orange. </p> <p>He lives in the novelist's philosophical hope, too, of somebody picking up the film rights for He Kills Coppers. 'Of course it would be great if the Americans bought it,' he smiles. 'Set the early stuff in Vietnam, not Malaya, and gave me lots of money...' </p> <p>In the meantime, not holding his breath, he is working on the third part of what will turn into a loose trilogy about the myths of Sixties London. </p> <p>And after that? </p> <p>'Oh, I'll do something completely different,' he says. 'I seem to have developed this obsession with empire, and I'd like to go back to like The Riddle of the Sands era, I think. The Krays loved it all. Apparently, Ronnie went to see Gordon of Khartoum and he came out with tears in his eyes, and said, you know, \"Gordon was a real man, and he was bent, like me...\" I love all that stuff. </p> <p>'I sometimes play a parlour game - name the straight empire hero. They were all gay, had to be, really: Gordon of Khartoum, Lawrence of Arabia, Baden-Powell. I don't know about Clive of India, but, I mean, probably...' Arnott laughs, drains his wine, looks up and says: 'I suppose I've always been interested in the extraordinary modes of expression brought about by all that repression.'</p>",

'It had the word \"crepuscular\" in the second paragraph') which collected a neat stack of rejection slips, and he was pushing 40 when his book came out. He is reluctant to suggest that the subsequent hype did much to propel The Long Firm on to the bestseller lists, either: 'Perhaps the saving grace of publishing,' he says, bright eyed and hesitantly spoken, 'is that even with the greatest amount of publicity possible, it's not really going to impinge on the general population in any way at all. It's not like being in a boy band. People aren't that interested in authors really. Any book has to sell itself.' The Long Firm did just that. An inspired reaction to the heritage industry of East End organised crime, it trained the sawn-off conventions of a gangster novel on received notions of masculinity. The book tells the story of one Harry Starks, a gay Soho racketeer with a taste for cultural studies and stage-managed menaces. Starks was loosely based on Ronnie Kray, with a dash of Macheath, the aspirational villain of Brecht's Threepenny Opera, thrown in. As soon as he started writing it, Arnott knew he was on to something: a way of getting at the particular male anxieties that begin to tell the story of Englishness in the latter part of the twentieth century. 'I did the whole book,' he says. 'with a kind of pressing fear that someone would beat me to it and write about Ronnie Kray and his boyfriends, because it was such a wonderful, obvious story.' He suggests that, in a way, Quentin Tarantino had started the trend 'with this very homosocial lads kind of movie, in which everyone is scared of being \"bottom\", everyone literally watching their arse', but suggests, too, that he wanted to come at 'that kind of fetishised masculinity from a different angle. Obviously, some people might read my books for exactly that masculinity: fast moving, lots of violence, and so on, but I think there is a little more going on, too.' As it turned out, Arnott also pre-empted the latest bout of gangland nostalgia that attended Guy Ritchie's film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He finds it vaguely amusing that he and Ritchie have sometimes been lumped together at the vanguard of a revivalist British trend. 'In, say, Lock, Stock, you come away thinking essentially this is a feel-good gangster movie,' he says, distancing himself from the idea. 'I mean, my idea of film noir is that there should be at least a little bit of noir about it. The great examples of the genre show how the individual is brought down by society, the great American tragedy if you like. You shouldn't come away just thinking: that was fun. Gangsters can't simply succeed.' In some ways, Jake Arnott is well placed to comment on the particular merits of 'failure' in a man's life. Having done wilfully little to live up to his management consultant father's aspirations for him at the boys' grammar school in Aylesbury, he left at 16 and tried a variety of ill-fitting worlds for size. Looking back, he says, giggling a little at the idea, 'National Service might have done me some good, anything tangible really.' Instead, he found himself living in a series of London squats and working in the mortuary at University College Hospital. 'My main duty was to clean the vast dissection-room floor first thing in the morning,' he recalls, 'with about 150 bodies on these glass-topped trolleys. If you'd filmed it from the top with stop action, it would have been this strange Busby Berkeley scene. I'd often sing show tunes with the embalmer Kay, from Walthamstow, and I did learn how to embalm a body, so that was useful, in a way.' This Damien Hirst fantasy came at a time in his life when, he says - chirpily - he was 'disturbed and depressed and I think still trying to sort out lots of things in myself. I came out as bisexual in my twenties, still had girlfriends and it was all, you know, mad flux. Looking back, I'm glad there was all that to work through, because there's nothing left to worry about now, nothing at all'. Some of those happily resolved conflicts resurface in different guises in his novels, he admits, but he rejects the notion of himself as a 'gay writer'. 'I suppose I've always felt that an identity solely based on sexuality is a bit depressing anyway,' he says. 'In the Eighties, it was a slightly too political thing; now, even worse, it's become a marketing niche.' The person who did most to help Arnott through his period of doubt was his paternal grandmother who lived in Clapham and who had worked in the West End as a dancer for most of her life (Arnott's father had done his own rebelling by moving to Buckinghamshire). She was the first person Arnott talked with about his sexuality: 'As a dancer, she knew so many. But also because I knew she would have an honest reaction to it. It's difficult for the parents anyway. That pressure to say the right thing. But she had no qualms.' In return, his grandmother always told him vivid stories about her time on the Soho stage and these tales became the root of his fascination with the role in that world of the mob, a fascination which led to the preoccupations of The Long Firm. 'I was interested in the kind of theatricality that attends violence,' he says. 'If part of your job is to have this profile of menace, you need that front of artifice. Gangsters often talk about \"shaping up\" before they get into a fight. I remember John McVicar suggesting how good he had been in going through that kind of performance. And, of course, there is a long history of villains sending their children to stage school.' Arnott's career on the stage, also partly inspired by his grandmother's example, was less dramatic than it might have been. Throughout the Eighties, he picked up bits of work, 'improvisational stuff, all very obscure and underpaid', and subsequently became involved with Red Ladder, a theatre company in Leeds. 'I think it was socialist-feminist, though it might have been the other way round,' he says. His acting was one aspect of an unfocused political involvement - 'endless marches, demos, meetings' - that came with life in the squatted houses and warehouses of south London. It was that period of Arnott's life which provided the genesis for his second novel. On one march in the early Eighties, he heard a chant, borrowed from the football terraces, used by Class War to goad the police: 'Harry Roberts is our friend/ is our friend/ is our friend/ he kills coppers'. The chant - 'something eerie about it, like a malevolent nursery rhyme' - referred to the infamous murder of three Met officers in 1966. Over the years, the words haunted Arnott as 'emblematic of all that working-class-hero nonsense, typical of the anarchists, who wanted to seem butch and bold' and when he came to research the real story of Harry Roberts, a man with a grudge, a veteran of the colonial conflict in Malaya, 'a kind of Travis Bickle', it led him into a tale of three decades of corruption on both sides of the law. Roberts is reinvented in He Kills Coppers as Billy Porter, and through a series of smart connections, Arnott also succeeds in recreating the world into which he emerged. Some of these links were chance encounters: 1966 obviously led him to football - his book addresses the implications of the 'great national bonding moment' that was the World Cup victory - and while he was researching that he came across a London Evening Standard clipping that tied in a CID operation to the beautiful game: Nipper Read leading a clean-up iniative on Soho clip-joints for the duration of the tournament. 'It was like the opening scene of Measure for Measure,' he says. 'You know where the Duke charges Angelo to clean up the city and, of course, those supposed to be sorting things out get corrupted themselves.' Arnott is slightly concerned that his book goes over some of this contentious ground at a time when Harry Roberts, who has been in prison for 34 years, is coming up for release. 'He's awaiting a parole board, I believe,' he says, guardedly. 'He's in open conditions. I have to be careful because I don't want to get caught up in any of that debate. Although, of course, as soon as soon as I mentioned in passing to my publisher that Roberts might be paroled this year, their eyes were going round in their heads.' The case also provided Arnott with a way of exploring some of his own past, in that he uses the folkloric 'Harry Roberts, he's our friend' idea to satirise the 'easy radicalism' of the Eighties. 'I'm very cruel about the kind of person I was then, I suppose,' he says now. 'The chant itself sort of encapsulated everything I hated about the anarchist movement. I just got sick of the fact that in every squat there would be this inevitable all-inclusive debate about everything - racism, class war, sexuality - brought into discussions about whether you were going to have a washing-up rota. People would always label you a fascist if you argued that there should be one,' he laughs. 'You know, that kind of thing.' The point at which Arnott realised that the revolution probably wasn't going to happen was when he helped to organise support for the miners in 1985. 'A women's group came down from South Yorkshire to thank us,' he remembers, 'and, of course, they had dressed up for the occasion. And they walked into this place, this squatters' caf\u00e9, and you could see the look on their faces, like, \"Fucking hell, they're sending us food\". And I suddenly just thought this was just so ridiculous, like pretending we were in nineteenth-century Poland or something.' How Arnott got from there to here is the stuff of publisher's blurbs. He now owns a flat on Islington's Upper Street in north London and is amused by the fact that the lifestyle he once enjoyed for nothing - playing Changing Rooms in empty warehouses - is now the expensive aspiration of City bankers and way beyond his vaunted 'substantial six figure' means. Still, he's not complaining. He has just signed another two-book deal with his publisher and is waiting for a script of The Long Firm to be worked up into a TV series by Joe Penhall, the author of the National Theatre hit Blue/Orange. He lives in the novelist's philosophical hope, too, of somebody picking up the film rights for He Kills Coppers. 'Of course it would be great if the Americans bought it,' he smiles. 'Set the early stuff in Vietnam, not Malaya, and gave me lots of money...' In the meantime, not holding his breath, he is working on the third part of what will turn into a loose trilogy about the myths of Sixties London. And after that? 'Oh, I'll do something completely different,' he says. 'I seem to have developed this obsession with empire, and I'd like to go back to like The Riddle of the Sands era, I think. The Krays loved it all. Apparently, Ronnie went to see Gordon of Khartoum and he came out with tears in his eyes, and said, you know, \"Gordon was a real man, and he was bent, like me...\" I love all that stuff. 'I sometimes play a parlour game - name the straight empire hero. They were all gay, had to be, really: Gordon of Khartoum, Lawrence of Arabia, Baden-Powell. I don't know about Clive of India, but, I mean, probably...' Arnott laughs, drains his wine, looks up and says: 'I suppose I've always been interested in the extraordinary modes of expression brought about by all that repression.'",

Victims of the Boer War and both world wars found themselves here; Wilfred Owen was a patient. An 'eerie, depressing place', doctors would experiment on themselves in the laboratories and, it was rumoured, use German PoWs as human guinea pigs.

But it is Spike Island's only failing, and a small one. </p> <p>More daring, and far more successful, is the personal history that the author weaves into the fabric of the book. Hoare writes of his own family, who live near the hospital (Hoare himself attended a school whose class huts were once part of the building), and recounts childhood memories, strange coincidences and the death of his brother and his father. </p> <p>Spike Island - elaborate, riveting, touching, strangely romantic - is itself a gothic tale and, one imagines, a catharsis for the author.

      "body": "<p>Reginald Hill is clearly having a very good time in Dialogues of the Dead (HarperCollins \u00a316.99, pp453), the eighteenth of his highly acclaimed, award-winning police-procedural series featuring Andy Dalziel and Peter Pascoe. There are murders aplenty as a serial killer dubbed the Wordman cuts a swathe through a range of literary luminaries on Dalziel's patch, then writes up his exploits in multiple entries for a short-story competition. But there's also pretty much a laugh a line and a playful enjoyment of language in all its forms, from the 'Fat Man' Dalziel's colourful Yorkshire dialect to arcane polysyllables and bizarre neologisms. </p> <p>For as well as being a hugely enjoyable mystery, Dialogues of the Dead is a novel about language, about its power and the power of naming (half the characters are using assumed or altered names for a variety of reasons). Much of the humour comes from the clash between Dalziel's exaggerated crudity and more intellectual matters in which Hill is clearly interested, as when Dalziel is described 'scratching his crotch like a man refuting Bishop Berkeley'. </p> <p>Dalziel and Pascoe, while looming large in the novel, share centre stage with 'Hat' Bowler the ambitious young DC who reminds Pascoe of his young self. Bowler is in pursuit both of the Wordman and Rye Pomona, the lovely but distant librarian who helps him with the case. </p> <p>Almost everybody is other than they seem and Hill keeps you guessing just about to the end - you might figure out the final twist but it remains a satisfying conclusion nevertheless. Dialogues of the Dead is a highly engaging read, but I recommend you keep a dictionary handy. </p> <p>For Riptide (Weidenfeld and Nicolson \u00a316.99, pp322), the fourth novel featuring Frederick Troy, the policeman son of a distinguished Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9, John Lawton has turned the clock back to 1941, three years before the setting of his striking debut novel, Blackout. It's spring, America is neutral (just), Russia is about to be invaded by Germany and Troy is still a young, ambitious sergeant in the Metropolitan Police. </p> <p>After 10 years spying for the Americans, Wolfgang Stahl, deputy to Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Heydrich, disappears during an air raid on Berlin. He's supposed to be dead but nobody believes it: not MI6, which assumes he's headed for London; not US intelligence, which sends a young German-speaking captain to the English capital to find Stahl; and certainly not Heydrich, who dispatches Nazi assassins to England to kill his deputy before the Allies can get their hands on him. </p> <p>The sense of London during the Blitz is strong and the story, with its mix of real history and believable invention, is fast-paced, twisting and tense. There's also an intriguing m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois of the US captain, Troy, who is working with Stahl, and a precocious, independent policewoman, who, in her own way, loves them both. These elements combine to produce a novel that is sheer entertainment. </p> <p>Julie Parsons got high praise for her first two psychological thrillers and her publishers are giving her third novel, Eager to Please (Macmillan \u00a310, pp370), a big promotional push. It charts the life of Rachel Beckett, how she is imprisoned for 12 years for the murder of her husband (a murder she swears she didn't commit) and how, when she is finally released, she plots her revenge on the person she holds responsible for framing her for his death. </p> <p>The publishers describe the novel as 'literary crime', which I guess means that Parsons takes her time establishing Beckett's character. This makes for a slow but absorbing start as the horrors of going to jail and then of adjusting back to civilian life are carefully described. The problem is that Beckett is established so strongly I would have liked it more if Parsons had stayed with her story throughout the novel. </p> <p>But, perhaps to inject mystery - because there is no mystery about who really did kill Rachel Beckett's husband - the author abruptly takes the focus off Beckett and introduces, about a third of the way into the book, a new main character, Inspector Jack Donnelly, and a new murder investigation. The two stories do eventually merge, but not seamlessly, and the careful, realistic writing of much of the novel gives way to a rather melodramatic ending that seems to belong in another book. Eager to Please is compelling but flawed. </p> <p>The same can be said of Caroline Carver's Blood Junction (Orion \u00a39.99, pp280) but for a first novel that's pretty good going. It's a fast-paced tale centred round journalist India Kane, who travels from Sydney to the outback town of Cooinda for a reunion with her friend Lauren. Forty years before, the town witnessed the massacre of an entire Aboriginal family and locals renamed it Blood Junction. When Kane arrives, she is almost immediately arrested for murder. </p> <p>Carver is particularly good at making you feel Kane's isolation and fear and the threatening atmosphere around her. There are also enough startling incidents to keep you turning those pages, but I wasn't entirely sold on the plot. Nevertheless, Blood Junction is a most promising debut. </p> <p>Donna Leon, meanwhile, goes from strength to strength. Her latest Guido Brunetti novel, A Sea of Troubles (Heinemann \u00a315.99, pp247) is clever, vivid and wholly absorbing. In it, Commissario Brunetti tries to investigate the murders of two clam fisherman from the close-knit community of the island of Pellestrina on the Venetian lagoon. This is her tenth Brunetti novel but it's a fresh and entertaining as the first, Death at La Fenice. Dare I say that these days Brunetti is edging out Michael Dibdin's Aurelio Zen as the most interesting Italian policeman in fiction? </p> <p>Cutter and Bone (Serpents Tail \u00a37.99 pp320), Newton Thornburg's landmark crime novel is a minor masterpiece of 1970s American literature. It's a taut thriller but like, say, Robert Stone's Dog Soldiers, it's also much more. Reissued by Serpents Tail, with an introduction by George P. Pelecanos, it still carries a big wallop. </p> <p>Bone is the ageing gigolo who witnesses the dumping of a murdered woman's body and Cutter is the embittered, viciously articulate, maimed Vietnam veteran who insists on nailing the tycoon they suspect of the murder in a scheme that is part vengeance, part blackmail, part self-destructive lunacy.

There are improbabilities in any novel. My problem with this novel is that the plot is set in John Cole's native city, Belfast, in 1977, when I was working there as correspondent for the Guardian, of which John had been assistant editor. </p> <p>John was then reporting on British politics, first as the deputy editor of The Observer and then as the political editor of the BBC. In both roles, he assiduously avoided commenting on Northern Ireland, recognising how difficult his instinctive bias was to suppress. He had worked in Northern Ireland as a reporter for the first 11 years of his career. My most frequent contact with him was in the House of Commons, when I travelled from Belfast to cover Northern Ireland debates and he twitted me about being too gulled by the Nationalists, as he knew himself to be too gut-reactingly Unionist. </p> <p>The novel's plot turns on the traumas brought to the family of a Northern Irish Protestant journalist, who accepts an invitation from a pre-Thatcherite Labour government to serve as policy adviser to the Northern Ireland Secretary. It was a time when John himself, who joined the Guardian to report on trade union affairs, was used as a sounding-board by members of the Wilson and the Callaghan governments about what he calls, his accent not completely softened by his 40 years in England, 'Ulster'. </p> <p>However, it is hard to believe a Belfast-born 'Prod', who was so publicly recognisable that people in the street knew him, as Cole makes his hero, could walk into the Falls, still only patrolled by the Army because it was too dangerous for the police, to meet a senior member of the IRA army council over a couple of pints of Guinness to initiate peace negotiations. </p> <p>The scenario is the more unlikely since Cole's IRA man chooses a Provo drinking club so that he will be seen by his Provo circle to have the ear of the 'Brits'. </p> <p>Some of the physical descriptions of the city sound an odd note, too. They seem to date from later. The Europa was nowhere near as cosy in 1977 as the novel makes it. However, Belfast is a strange city and seemingly utterly improbable meetings in improbable settings have occurred to achieve the current peace process. What the novel certainly does catch is the wreckage the Troubles have brought to ordinary families and the mismatch between the needs of Northern Ireland and the priorities of Westminster. It tellingly reflects the destructive lunacies that government 'spooks' have perpetrated by listening to the wilder voices on all political sides. </p> <p>There are other improbabilities in the story, not least that the hero's wife contemplates leaving the domestic hearth of 20 years to live with another man on the strength of a couple of pecks on the cheek. Accused of adultery, she reacts in blank horror: 'That has not happened.' </p> <p>With all these provisos, most of them reflecting my too great intimacy with the era the novel is set in, this is a story that rolls along grippingly with telling insights into the politics of the British and the Northern Ireland administrations, and into the mind of the sort of liberal, Labour-supporting Protestant that Cole is. Its most serious flaw is probably that it is too hard on the media. We may be easily led by spin doctors, but most of us are surely less wickedly vacuous than John makes the TV programme-makers whose follies drive the plot. </p> <p>The story is, of course, well and tightly written, as one should expect from a journalist so professional, well worth the brief hours that it demands for its readers to reach the pathos of its conclusion.</p>",

My most frequent contact with him was in the House of Commons, when I travelled from Belfast to cover Northern Ireland debates and he twitted me about being too gulled by the Nationalists, as he knew himself to be too gut-reactingly Unionist. The novel's plot turns on the traumas brought to the family of a Northern Irish Protestant journalist, who accepts an invitation from a pre-Thatcherite Labour government to serve as policy adviser to the Northern Ireland Secretary. It was a time when John himself, who joined the Guardian to report on trade union affairs, was used as a sounding-board by members of the Wilson and the Callaghan governments about what he calls, his accent not completely softened by his 40 years in England, 'Ulster'. However, it is hard to believe a Belfast-born 'Prod', who was so publicly recognisable that people in the street knew him, as Cole makes his hero, could walk into the Falls, still only patrolled by the Army because it was too dangerous for the police, to meet a senior member of the IRA army council over a couple of pints of Guinness to initiate peace negotiations. The scenario is the more unlikely since Cole's IRA man chooses a Provo drinking club so that he will be seen by his Provo circle to have the ear of the 'Brits'. Some of the physical descriptions of the city sound an odd note, too. They seem to date from later. The Europa was nowhere near as cosy in 1977 as the novel makes it. However, Belfast is a strange city and seemingly utterly improbable meetings in improbable settings have occurred to achieve the current peace process. What the novel certainly does catch is the wreckage the Troubles have brought to ordinary families and the mismatch between the needs of Northern Ireland and the priorities of Westminster. It tellingly reflects the destructive lunacies that government 'spooks' have perpetrated by listening to the wilder voices on all political sides. There are other improbabilities in the story, not least that the hero's wife contemplates leaving the domestic hearth of 20 years to live with another man on the strength of a couple of pecks on the cheek. Accused of adultery, she reacts in blank horror: 'That has not happened.' With all these provisos, most of them reflecting my too great intimacy with the era the novel is set in, this is a story that rolls along grippingly with telling insights into the politics of the British and the Northern Ireland administrations, and into the mind of the sort of liberal, Labour-supporting Protestant that Cole is. Its most serious flaw is probably that it is too hard on the media. We may be easily led by spin doctors, but most of us are surely less wickedly vacuous than John makes the TV programme-makers whose follies drive the plot. The story is, of course, well and tightly written, as one should expect from a journalist so professional, well worth the brief hours that it demands for its readers to reach the pathos of its conclusion.",

The story centres around a heroine. Love is the engine that drives and directs the narrative; desire gives it shape and dimension. Topographical detail is closely rendered and lit with a gathering fever of emotion. There's a faultless depiction of place and time, served up on a bed of generous reservation: even flawed characters are worthy of pity.</p> <p>But this is also a new departure for Faulks. The title is taken from a Miles Davis track, and the novel's structure owes much to the complex layering of rhythm and theme that is the currency of jazz: the story is delivered in a non-linear sequence, buoyant with swing and syncopation. And the plot performs like an elegant melody, sliding above and below a dense articulation of sound, so that any sense of a character's autonomy - a sudden, heartfelt solo - is soon tempered by the limits of tradition, family, or a diplomatic world become stupid with Cold War paranoia. </p> <p>The setting, too, is a new one. The story is played out in Washington, New York and London - with a brief stint in Moscow. The Second World War is the subject of remembrance, merely offering the background boom of noise to more subtle, personal themes of desire and despair: this is, above all, a love story. But it is a love story with scant hope of resolution. </p> <p>Mary's family depends on her: her mother is dying, her children are lonely, her husband can't live without her. And at 40, she feels that 'the slipped responsibilities of the old and young were hers alone to bear'. But it's impossible to resolve the love story for another reason: she admits to 'a hunger for his [her lover's] presence that his presence could not sate'. To my mind, Faulks's writing is at its best when he allows metaphor to convey this sense of emotion's pressure against possibility's limit. And the island of Manhattan is as useful a metaphor as any. </p> <p>The lovers' dream of insularity is entirely subject to the waking reality of the world's physical and political landscape. Manhattan is far from being a blessed isle, after all. There are traffic jams and delayed flights to contend with. And notwithstanding Frank's declaration to Mary, 'I love you with all my heart', waiters wield an awesome power with, 'Can I get you folks the check now?' </p> <p>My main reservation is that Faulks takes no risks. He never falls into what V.S. Pritchett called 'the determined stupor out of which great novelists work'. But then it's nice to be able to criticise a novel essentially on the grounds that you wish there were more flaws, signs of authorial sweat and struggle - what William Faulkner called 'the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing'. (I imagine Faulks has a mind like an expensive car: his readers travel in certainty and comfort, even through dangerous neighbourhoods.) Having said this, he successfully renders the trope of passion as a circular descent into the underworld. Mary crosses the Delaware, thinking more of the Styx than the first state of the Union. Later, she gets lost on Moscow's ring roads. She also takes a train through 'an underworld of rusted sidings and wrecked tracks'. </p> <p>But it is Faulks's insistence on the inability of an individual human life ever to contain the spirit that galvanises it, that underpins his story. The jazz metaphor is as apt as Charlie's confessed fondness for Melville: however tricksy or vast the vessel of expression, humility forces one to admit that the greater part of life is uncontainable, endlessly various, ultimately elusive. </p> <p>Just as Charlie despaired of the limits of literature, Mary almost despairs of love, wondering if it means only that 'at some point you give up the idea of yourself as a person capable of infinite expansion'. But her love for Frank tells her otherwise, and I suspect that, as an author, Faulks is rather in awe of his heroine's yearning to step beyond the limits of her life.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Around 1.6m people will buy a house for the first time in 2001, says the Council of Mortgage Lenders. But without a lot of preparation, the process can become a nightmare long before you get your hands on the keys.</p> <p>There are 10 vital stages, and the first four should be completed before you even visit an estate agent.</p> <p>1. Saving for a deposit. Most first-time buyers need to save as much as they can to minimise their borrowing. Many lenders demand 10%, though Virgin One asks half that and some, such as the Halifax, take as little as 3%.</p> <p>The average cost of a home in Britain is \u00a387,038, according to the Halifax, but first- time buyers outside London usually pay an average of\u00a358,198, says the Nationwide building society Assuming you need a 5% deposit for a \u00a365,000 flat, your first cost will be the \u00a33,250 deposit.</p> <p>2. What sort of mortgage? Some 125 lenders offer more than 4,000 between them. Many first-timers ask a broker, some of whom charge a fee, to find the best deal. The alternative is to try the high street or the internet and choose from the following sorts of loan:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Standard variable mortgages (SVR), where the interest rates are set at between 1.5 and 2% above the Bank of England base rate.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Discounted: interest is charged below SVR, but reverts to it after a set time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fixed, where you agree to pay a set rate regardless of changes to base rate or a lender's SVR.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Capped mortgages, which cannot rise above an agreed ceiling but can fall at the lender's discretion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Flexible loans, which rarely offer the most competitive rates but allow borrowers to repay extra when they have spare cash.</p> <p>3. Find out how much you can borrow. Loans are based on income. The Norwich and Peterborough Building Society is typical in offering sole buyers 3.5 times their income, so if you earn \u00a320,000 a year, your mortgage could be \u00a370,000.</p> <p>For a couple there are two ratios. One is 3.5 times the highest income plus one time the lowest. If each of you earn \u00a320,000, the loan would be \u00a370,000 plus \u00a320,000 - a total of \u00a390,000. The second is 2.6 times the joint income. In our example that would total \u00a3104,000.</p> <p>But self-employed borrowers beware. Some lenders insist on audited books going back up to three years.</p> <p>4. Finding a property.

      "bodyText": "Around 1.6m people will buy a house for the first time in 2001, says the Council of Mortgage Lenders. But without a lot of preparation, the process can become a nightmare long before you get your hands on the keys. There are 10 vital stages, and the first four should be completed before you even visit an estate agent. 1. Saving for a deposit. Most first-time buyers need to save as much as they can to minimise their borrowing. Many lenders demand 10%, though Virgin One asks half that and some, such as the Halifax, take as little as 3%. The average cost of a home in Britain is \u00a387,038, according to the Halifax, but first- time buyers outside London usually pay an average of\u00a358,198, says the Nationwide building society Assuming you need a 5% deposit for a \u00a365,000 flat, your first cost will be the \u00a33,250 deposit. 2. What sort of mortgage? Some 125 lenders offer more than 4,000 between them. Many first-timers ask a broker, some of whom charge a fee, to find the best deal. The alternative is to try the high street or the internet and choose from the following sorts of loan: \u00b7 Standard variable mortgages (SVR), where the interest rates are set at between 1.5 and 2% above the Bank of England base rate. \u00b7 Discounted: interest is charged below SVR, but reverts to it after a set time. \u00b7 Fixed, where you agree to pay a set rate regardless of changes to base rate or a lender's SVR. \u00b7 Capped mortgages, which cannot rise above an agreed ceiling but can fall at the lender's discretion. \u00b7 Flexible loans, which rarely offer the most competitive rates but allow borrowers to repay extra when they have spare cash. 3. Find out how much you can borrow. Loans are based on income. The Norwich and Peterborough Building Society is typical in offering sole buyers 3.5 times their income, so if you earn \u00a320,000 a year, your mortgage could be \u00a370,000. For a couple there are two ratios. One is 3.5 times the highest income plus one time the lowest. If each of you earn \u00a320,000, the loan would be \u00a370,000 plus \u00a320,000 - a total of \u00a390,000. The second is 2.6 times the joint income. In our example that would total \u00a3104,000. But self-employed borrowers beware. Some lenders insist on audited books going back up to three years. 4. Finding a property. Visit agents in the area you are moving to, give them precise details of what you want and your price range. Remember, house-selling is not tightly regulated, and agents act in vendors' best interests, not the buyers'. The internet can help buyers to shortlist properties, but is no substitute for a visit. 5. Making an offer. First, check that the seller can move out when you want to move in. If all looks good, make an offer, subject to contract. House-buying experts Hometrack say the size of offer depends on the market. If demand is strong, buyers are likely to offer close to the asking price. 6. Get a survey. Your lender will require a valuation survey to ensure the home is worth more than the mortgage.

The scope of the programme, the resources spent on finding the best witnesses and footage for 26 one-hour episodes can't be matched today. Competition in a medium stuffed with channels has downsized budgets. The need to catch and hold attention with any trick, however meretricious, has undermined respect for the viewers' intelligence.</p> <p>The difference between The World at War 's efforts to tell it like it really was and Jeremy Bowen's asinine hunt for the 'real' Jesus - 'The film crew are going to leave me, up here, all alone, in a cave, high up on the Mount of Temptation in the middle of the Judaean desert!' - is a cultural chasm. We are stranded on the wrong side looking back at a lost world.</p> <p>Veterans of the series retain a justifiable pride in their achievement, but are struck by what they didn't find out. They worked from 1970 to 1973. Pretty much everyone on the British side in the Second World War was more than happy to talk to them. No one mentioned the breaking of the supposedly unbreakable Enigma code with the first working prototype of a computer. The World at War 's account of the Battle of the Atlantic has the Allies deploying superior naval tactics to defeat the U-boats. The writers didn't know that the Allies were able to blast the U-boats out of the ocean because they had the slight advantage of being able to read German signals.</p> <p>My colleague, Neal Ascherson, who worked on the programme, remains astonished. Twelve thousand people, including his very own sister, deciphered Enigma codes at Bletchley Park. At the end of the war they were sworn to utter and permanent secrecy. There were no sticks or carrots. The codebreakers trusted authority and kept quiet about their part in one of the great intellectual achievements of the twentieth century.</p> <p>Imagine how difficult it was for men in particular to stay silent or to mutter that they had 'desk jobs', while others boasted of their experience of combat; to take the condescension and questioning of their courage and not to be able to shout that they had saved lives and turned battles. But they did - for decades. Their enormous stoicism represents the best side of the national character. Very British, as we used to say.</p> <p>On Wednesday David Shayler goes on trial for refusing put his trust in authority. The former MI5 officer faces three charges of breaking the Official Secrets Act and a maximum prison sentence of six years if convicted. He will not deny that he refused to restrain himself. He told the Mail on Sunday about MI5's files on politicians and its poisonous office politics; how it wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds on tapping the phones of a journalist and fluffed chances to catch an IRA active service unit and prevent the bombing of the Israeli embassy. The legal argument will, in its own way, turn on the national character; on what it means to be British.</p> <p>The British are not meant to be the victims of political trials. We're a democracy, not some sweltering banana republic. The British have equality before the law - a politician cannot order the arrest of ideological enemy while allowing criminal officials and bent suppliers of party funds to go free. We're innocent until found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by a jury of our peers. We're free to speak our minds.</p> <p>Protected by these ancient liberties the free-born Briton can pity the luckless inhabitants of Abroad as lesser breeds without the law. Until, that is, he's charged under the Official Secrets Act and discovers that everything he thought he knew about Britain was tosh.</p> <p>The Shayler trial is a political trial. The prosecution was authorised by Lord Williams, the Attorney General and a politician who wants to restrict the rights of juries to reach true verdicts in the courts. A separate civil action against Shayler was cleared by Jack Straw, the Home Secretary. When Shayler fled to exile in Paris because a vengeful Government decided to persecute the whistle-blower rather than investigate his allegations, Britain persuaded the French to arrest him. The French courts said he was a political prisoner who couldn't be extradited for political crimes and released him.</p> <p>The trial won't be much of a vindication of equality before the law either. If the Government believes Shayler broke the Official Secrets Act by talking to the Mail on Sunday, then it must also believe that the paper broke the law when it published his tales of a bungling and unaccountable secret state. The Mail on Sunday is not being prosecuted. I've no wish to see journalists sent to prison - apart from news editors, obviously - but the only explanation for selective justice I can find lies in a balance of power. Shayler has been widely slandered and is all but broke. The Mail on Sunday is a wealthy institution which can afford the best lawyers in London. There is also an election coming up. Someone may well have calculated that its editor would not have taken the kindest view of New Labour if it had compelled him to organise his political coverage from the dock of the Old Bailey.</p> <p>The charges against Shayler, meanwhile, are selective. His most sensational accusation was that MI6 spent \u00a3100,000 on a failed attempt to assassinate Colonel Gadaffi. Robin Cook dismissed it as 'pure fantasy'. Documents supporting Shayler's allegations were posted on the internet. Shayler's account of MI6 officers organising a coup by Islamic fundamentalists suddenly looked credible. Egypt, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia prefer Gadaffi to the alternative. They are fighting religious opponents and would have been furious with Britain if the assasination had succeeded. Someone has taken the politic decision not to charge Shayler with leaking details of the plot. No one will discuss Libya at the trial or how MI6 can play games in North Africa without the approval of elected politicians.</p> <p>As for freedom of speech, the Official Secrets Act prohibits it. You can be prosecuted even if you have found evidence of corruption in MI5 or 6. It's a crime to reveal a crime. All information from the security services is a state secret, unless it is in the forthcoming memoirs of Stella Rimmington, the former head of MI5, who appears to be above the law. The Government doesn't have to prove that Shayler helped an enemy, merely that he spoke out. This is probably just as well from the Government's point of view. All an enemy could learn from Shayler's revelation that MI5 classed Jack Straw, Harriet Harman and Peter Mandelson - three of the more right-wing politicians in Labour history - as dangerous subversives is that the British secret service is run by reactionary simpletons.</p> <p>Liberty, the human rights group which represents Shayler, will argue that blanket official secrecy contradicts the European Convention of Human Rights. The case should be stopped, it says, and the 1989 Official Secrets Act reformed. The prosecution will say that Parliament wanted a blanket ban when it passed the Act and the Commons can override human rights law. (They'll have to forget that Straw and Tony Blair opposed the Tory measure in 1989 precisely because it didn't give defendants the chance to argue that their revelations were in the public interest.) The legal dispute could last for months - each side has said it will appeal if it loses. Shayler may never have to face a jury.</p> <p>If he escapes, he can relish the irony that the Europe which the codebreakers of Bletchley Park worked to save is now a better defender of British liberty than Parliament. Even if he loses, the ideas he represents will win.</p> <p>The Enigma codebreakers kept quiet because they believed in authority. Their trust was abused. They were forced to stay silent until the mid-1970s, not for reasons of genuine security but to uphold secrecy for secrecy's sake and prevent reports of Britain's part in the atrocities of the Cold War being made public.</p> <p>Their deference has vanished and glasnost is a spirit of the age. You may not like the consequences. I back away from journalists who write about the awfulness of their boyfriends and difficulties with bowel movements. I would love to see Robert Kilroy-Silk and Esther Rantzen bankrupted because no one would expose themselves on their manipulative shows. I travel great distances to avoid the work of Tracey Emin.</p> <p>But egotism and babbling have their consolations. Governments and businesses can no longer be sure that their subordinates will obey orders to shut their mouths without good reason. Civil servants slip out documents. Patients demand inquiries into medical malpractice. The over-mighty directors of vast corporations can never quite escape the voice in the head which asks: 'What if this gets out?' The repressive laws of the 10-year regime of Michael Howard and Jack Straw can be seen as a vicious but, I hope, futile attempt to limit the growth in individual freedom.</p> <p>The chasm which separates us from Bletchley Park is uncrossable.

Next day Portillo refuses to sign the statement on race already endorsed by the leader, suggesting that the reality is precisely the opposite of what the picture seemed to show.</p> <p>Wendy Alexander proudly parades her new tourism boss, former aviation executive Rod Lynch, even though advisers warn that the Scottish press will ask him where he plans to take his holidays.</p> <p>The answer, quite reasonably, is the United States. But it prolongs the outburst of ersatz moral outrage that has forced the hapless Tourism Minister, Alasdair Morrison, to cut short a family holiday in Tuscany which he had booked long before the foot and mouth outbreak. Alexander, the serious-minded Minister who blundered into the Section 28 fiasco, has now been blamed by sources close to First Minister Henry McLeish for maladroitness.</p> <p>Yet the excessive respect that politicians show to newspapers is one of the more pathetic features of modern life. Mr Morrison should have faced down the media but, I imagine, received insufficient support from his superiors in the coalition.

      "bodyText": "Every week politics seems more and more like pantomime or a kind of slide show where images in rapid succession distort the underlying substance and dazzle the audience. Thus Hague poses for pictures with Portillo and the images expressing their undying mutual loyalty duly hit the front pages. Next day Portillo refuses to sign the statement on race already endorsed by the leader, suggesting that the reality is precisely the opposite of what the picture seemed to show. Wendy Alexander proudly parades her new tourism boss, former aviation executive Rod Lynch, even though advisers warn that the Scottish press will ask him where he plans to take his holidays. The answer, quite reasonably, is the United States. But it prolongs the outburst of ersatz moral outrage that has forced the hapless Tourism Minister, Alasdair Morrison, to cut short a family holiday in Tuscany which he had booked long before the foot and mouth outbreak. Alexander, the serious-minded Minister who blundered into the Section 28 fiasco, has now been blamed by sources close to First Minister Henry McLeish for maladroitness. Yet the excessive respect that politicians show to newspapers is one of the more pathetic features of modern life. Mr Morrison should have faced down the media but, I imagine, received insufficient support from his superiors in the coalition. Everybody is entitled to spend their holidays where they choose: that is the whole point of a holiday in the first place. This brutish press power is a kind of mob rule. And it is mildly depressing that the reporting of Scotland's new politics should remain where it began, in the shallower reaches of a lake called Trivia where highly-paid feuilletonists skim the froth and sell it to their gullible readers in the daily prints.

      "body": "<p>During the October 1974 election campaign, I asked Harold Wilson how he would advise people to vote in Tory-held seats where a Liberal was a close second, and Labour a distant third. This was a matter of some importance at the time since a previous election, held only seven months earlier, had resulted in a hung parliament. A single seat could well have made the difference between a Labour and a Tory government. Wilson removed his pipe from his mouth, expelled a cloud of tobacco smoke in my direction, replied: 'Vote Labour' and then clenched his teeth firmly and decisively once more on his pipe.</p> <p>Tactical voting was not then much talked about. It was the age of conviction politics, or so we thought. You voted for what you believed in. Certainly, I have never been able to vote anything other than Labour - not even for friends standing for the residents' association in local council elections - since I announced to my shocked parents at 18 that I had joined the party. Nor, I imagine, could my parents ever have voted tactically. I was the first of my family in three generations, I was sternly informed, to desert the Conservative Party, though my grandmother was thought once to have voted for Lloyd George on the grounds that he cut a dashing figure.</p> <p>Now, people are seemingly more sophisticated. I have before me lists of constituencies where tactical voting, or the lack of it compared to 1997, could make a difference; these are to be plotted on a giant map for this week's New Statesman. Billy Bragg, the musician and long-standing Labour supporter, has already informed our readers of his plans to expel the Tories from Dorset. He will cast his vote for the Lib Dems (who are within 2,000 votes of overthrowing the Tory Eurosceptic, Oliver Letwin, in West Dorset) in exchange for a promise from a Lib Dem supporter to vote Labour elsewhere in the county. This swap is to be arranged through Bragg's own internet website, though another site (<a href=\"http://www.tacticalvoter.com)\" target=\"_NEW\">www.tacticalvoter.com)</a> allows similar deals on a national scale.</p> <p>All this arouses great excitement among the commentating classes. But does it also represent a great leap in voter sophistication? In one sense, many people have voted tactically for more than half a century. Public approval of Liberal policies and Liberal leaders has usually far exceeded the party's performance in general elections. But, it was said, a vote for the Liberals was a wasted vote. They had no chance of forming a government. So people didn't vote for them. National newspapers have taken a similar view. To recommend a Liberal vote, it was always felt, was to brand the paper as marginal and frivolous. And yet the leader writers very often expressed the view that a large Liberal vote - to come from who knows where - would be a jolly good thing.</p> <p>Here we get to the nub of the matter, and a point that is not easily understood by political activists. As a rule, people do not vote out of enthusiasm or hope or idealism. Fear, hate and cynicism are greater motivators. They fear governments that will muck things up; they hate those that will interfere with their lives too much; they cynically believe that all politicians are much the same. They do not vote for politicians they admire, but against those they fear or despise most. Whatever their leaders may have said, the masses never believed that democracy offered the chance of Utopia. The vote was simply a means of controlling the worst excesses of the ruling class. That is why the most ambitiously idealistic regimes found it necessary to abolish voting.</p> <p>Tactical voting, therefore, is neither more nor less sophisticated than abstention. Indeed, the two go hand in hand. They are merely alternative ways of putting arrogant politicians in their place. In 1997, many people voted tactically, not because they were enthused by New Labour, but because they wanted to humiliate the Tories. This time, I suspect, many of the same people will abstain. Note that, despite all the excitement created by Ken Livingstone in London last year (a clear protest against the established parties), his vote was far exceeded by the numbers who didn't vote at all.</p> <p>All this strengthens the argument for some form of proportional representation. The objection to PR is that it turns politics into a matter of backroom deals, horse trading and cold calculation. That may be true for the politicians who, faced with permanently hung parliaments, have to negotiate with each other in order to form stable governments with agreed programmes. But PR allows the voters to follow their passions and beliefs, in the knowledge that their vote will still count in some way. It can pro vide a far more accurate snapshot of public opinion than any number of focus groups or polls.</p> <p>No system is perfect. In Australia, minority parties (of which there may be as many as 20 or 30 on the ballot papers) routinely advise their supporters on how to use their second and third preferences. Smart operators in the big parties invent 'dummy parties' to scoop up support from people who might otherwise vote for the opposition or not at all. Suppose Labour wants to get votes from the dopeheads and the pensioners. It finds somebody willing to stand under the banner of a Legalise Marijuana Party and somebody else willing to stand as a Senior Citizens Party candidate. These 'parties', which are likely to be eliminated fairly quickly, then advise their supporters to cast their second preference votes for Labour.</p> <p>It is all utterly cynical, but at least the cynicism is reserved to the political class, where it belongs. Ordinary voters rarely feel passionately about the ragbag programmes of the established parties, with all their fudges and compromises. They feel passionately about single issues: animal rights, the pound, nuclear power, the countryside and so on, as well as drugs and pensioners. Our system gives them no vehicle to express such passions without 'wasting' their votes. A good PR system would allow people to vote for what they really believe while still, through second or third preferences, casting a 'serious' vote for a future government. There is then no need for tactical voting; we leave the tactics to the politicians, who are the experts.</p> <p>That still leave us with the problem of what to do in the forthcoming election under an unreformed, first-past-the-post system. As it happens, I live in a Tory seat where Labour comes a not very close second, so I have no dilemma. But would I vote tactically? Isn't the Tory party weak enough as it is, without us trying to expel it even from strongholds like West Dorset or Michael Howard's Folkestone and Hythe? If all Labour and Lib Dem supporters followed Billy Bragg's example, there would hardly be a Tory MP left in the House of Commons.</p> <p>I have two answers to that. One is that it is worth voting tactically to persuade the Tories that they have no future under William Hague, and they need to change radically if they are to form an effective opposition. The other is that the Lib Dems, in any case, would make a better opposition than the Tories.</p> <p>So for now, tactical voting it is. But I'd still rather express my passions for, oh, I don't know, the Ban All Motorcars From Anywhere Near Me Party or the No Music in Restaurants Party, under a better electoral system.</p> <p>Peter Wilby is editor of the New Statesman</p>",

I remember sitting opposite him in the Foreign Office canteen one lunchtime, watching him demolish a pile of tweed-coloured slurry draped over a gaudy heap of pilau rice. Personal preference may have informed his decision to spurn the Chinese takeaway (its image dented by foot and mouth) or the doner kebab (never a winner with the River Cafe set) and single out, during his speech to the Social Market Foundation, chicken tikka massala as a 'true British national dish'. How right Mr Cook is. There is something quintessentially British about the diner who piles out of the pub, 10 pints of lager to the wind, in search of an Indian meal to fortify him against a night of aggro.</p> <p>Nothing conjures up some aspects of our national culture more effectively than tanked-up, Union Jack-flapping soccer fans belting out the 1998 World Cup anthem of 'Vindaloo'. Even at the genteel end of the market, the flock wallpaper and acid lighting of the average high-street Indian takeaway evoke exhausting hours and low pay for its staff rather than get-ahead vibrancy. Cook might have been on safer ground if he had stipulated stuffed crust pizza or pot noodles as our culinary emblem of multiculturalism.</p> <p>Alternatively, he could have recalled that politicians seeking to unfurl a vision of a certain type of Britain rarely sound convincing, whether their theme is cricket on the village green and spinsters cycling to Communion or an ode to an onion bhaji. Still, in some ways, the Baldwin of Brick Lane was successful. Given the febrile mood of the Opposition, all antidotes to racism are welcome. As a bonus, Cook's catchy way into the race debate provoked predictable and gravy-curdling wrath from beef Wellington fans incensed by his statement that there was no such thing as an 'ethnically pure' British race.</p> <p>Smoking out racism, in the Tory party and its supporters, would be more rewarding, but for the fact that the cheerleaders for Anglo-Saxon purity are so pathetic. John Townend was unknown before his recent anti-immigrant speech. Sir Richard Body, author of the xenophobically titled book, England For the English , exudes as much Powellite menace as Peter Rabbit. James Cran and Eric Forth, opponents of the Commission for Racial Equality's code of electoral conduct, hardly add up to Jorg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen. Michael Portillo, the most senior non-signatory, is not a racist but a tactically- brilliant Judas whose gesture will endear him to all those Tories who cannot decide whether William Hague or the bossy CRE appals them more.</p> <p>Hague is not a racist either. He is something almost worse, an opportunist who decided that it would be useful to mimic one. Hence his 'foreign land' speech, his authorisation of a leaflet on 'bogus asylum-seekers' and his swipe against the Macpherson Report. Some time ago, Andrew Lansley, the former Tory election strategist, told this newspaper that 'immigration played particularly well in the tabloids in the 1992 general election' and 'has more potential to hurt'. Now the pain is all Hague's. His attempt to be both asylum-seekers' scourge and immigrants' champion looks as fake as Lansley's assertion that his leader never played the race card.</p> <p>Of course he did, but so has Cook; not through his message but by his omissions. In particular, his cosy, curry-house scenario seemed oddly pitched in the week when white and Asian communities in the north of England went to war. Whatever racial unrest exists in Britain today is less a product of Tory rants than of the reality of life in Britain under a Labour administration which, as the Foreign Secretary did not say, has too often been a poor deliverer on issues involving race. Foot-dragging over the promised review of the iniquitous voucher scheme for asylum-seekers continues. The wider policy shambles has prompted the Council of Europe to castigate Britain for its treatment of migrants. While Hague might have been even harsher, the measure must be outcome, not intent.</p> <p>Cook, like all his senior colleagues, is a committed anti-racist. Personal credo does not, however, entitle him or any of them to paint a vista of a wish-list Utopia and pass it off as the real thing. Modern Britain, however tolerant and well-integrated, is far from a frictionless haven. As Ofsted discovered last year, the failure gap between Afro-Caribbean and Pakistani pupils and their white counterparts is nearly double that of a decade ago. Students from ethnic minorities have a much lower chance of getting a job than white graduates. In one recent week on BBC2, the only non-white faces in the channel's top 10 programmes (combined viewing figures of 33 million) were those of cartoon characters in The Simpsons. While government cannot be held responsible for who joins Charlie Dimmock on Ground Force , there is, in areas it can influence, too great a mismatch between rhetoric and results.</p> <p>Despite the eagerness by Jack Straw and the Metropolitan police commissioner to apply the findings of Sir William Macpherson, old tensions reappear as the second anniversary of the report approaches. In Bradford last week, a fight at a Hindu wedding erupted into a car-burning, window-smashing, battle between white and Asian youths which echoed the devastating 1995 riot. In Oldham, the tribal battles between young Bangladeshi and Pakistani men have mutated into a new delineation of aggression. According to police, more than half of the 572 racist attacks recorded in the town during the last year have been against whites. However the battle lines are drawn, the causes remain a constant dirge of unemployment, overcrowding and bleak futures.</p> <p>An exponential rise in the nationwide reporting of racist crime, up by 107 per cent over 12 months, no longer looks like Macpherson-inspired openness. It looks like more racist crime. That is not to criticise Sir William or those who seek to implement his recommendations. It is to say that there is a vast, unbridged gulf between semantics and solutions.</p> <p>Presentationally the Government (asylum-seekers apart) has been a model of correctness, but signatures on CRE declarations and benedictions to Macpherson are the easy bits. They are also camouflage on the uncomfortable reality that, at a time when racial harmony is lauded and the economy is strong, too little has been achieved.</p> <p>The conditions that create inner-city brawlers and school failures are also the complex issues of economic and social polarisation that fail to interest the Tories. The measure of their cynicism is that both Hague and Portillo have now, in different ways, mortgaged race issues to personal ambition.</p> <p>As for the Government, Robin Cook's vision of a multicultural nation sitting down to break poppadoms together does not quite reflect a landscape in which teachers, police officers, politicians and the judiciary remain disproportionately white.</p> <p>A Conservative Party that shows no sign of being in a position to ensure that such unfairness prevails looks less worrying than the prospect of a second-term government failing to alchemise its wishes on racial equality into results. Squandered influence is always more dangerous than none.</p>",

The wider policy shambles has prompted the Council of Europe to castigate Britain for its treatment of migrants. While Hague might have been even harsher, the measure must be outcome, not intent. Cook, like all his senior colleagues, is a committed anti-racist. Personal credo does not, however, entitle him or any of them to paint a vista of a wish-list Utopia and pass it off as the real thing. Modern Britain, however tolerant and well-integrated, is far from a frictionless haven. As Ofsted discovered last year, the failure gap between Afro-Caribbean and Pakistani pupils and their white counterparts is nearly double that of a decade ago. Students from ethnic minorities have a much lower chance of getting a job than white graduates. In one recent week on BBC2, the only non-white faces in the channel's top 10 programmes (combined viewing figures of 33 million) were those of cartoon characters in The Simpsons. While government cannot be held responsible for who joins Charlie Dimmock on Ground Force , there is, in areas it can influence, too great a mismatch between rhetoric and results. Despite the eagerness by Jack Straw and the Metropolitan police commissioner to apply the findings of Sir William Macpherson, old tensions reappear as the second anniversary of the report approaches. In Bradford last week, a fight at a Hindu wedding erupted into a car-burning, window-smashing, battle between white and Asian youths which echoed the devastating 1995 riot. In Oldham, the tribal battles between young Bangladeshi and Pakistani men have mutated into a new delineation of aggression. According to police, more than half of the 572 racist attacks recorded in the town during the last year have been against whites. However the battle lines are drawn, the causes remain a constant dirge of unemployment, overcrowding and bleak futures. An exponential rise in the nationwide reporting of racist crime, up by 107 per cent over 12 months, no longer looks like Macpherson-inspired openness. It looks like more racist crime. That is not to criticise Sir William or those who seek to implement his recommendations. It is to say that there is a vast, unbridged gulf between semantics and solutions. Presentationally the Government (asylum-seekers apart) has been a model of correctness, but signatures on CRE declarations and benedictions to Macpherson are the easy bits. They are also camouflage on the uncomfortable reality that, at a time when racial harmony is lauded and the economy is strong, too little has been achieved. The conditions that create inner-city brawlers and school failures are also the complex issues of economic and social polarisation that fail to interest the Tories. The measure of their cynicism is that both Hague and Portillo have now, in different ways, mortgaged race issues to personal ambition. As for the Government, Robin Cook's vision of a multicultural nation sitting down to break poppadoms together does not quite reflect a landscape in which teachers, police officers, politicians and the judiciary remain disproportionately white. A Conservative Party that shows no sign of being in a position to ensure that such unfairness prevails looks less worrying than the prospect of a second-term government failing to alchemise its wishes on racial equality into results. Squandered influence is always more dangerous than none.",

Gone are the simple days of 1992 when Tony Booth, father-in-law to the next but one leader of the Labour Party, had little reason to hold back and fought with righteous anger. Days when he told the party leadership, as he recalls now, with a wheezily infectious laugh, that Thatcher should be first against the wall.</p> <p>'Well, no, not quite,' he guffaws again, eyes vanishing into the folds of a life roundly lived, 'but I did tell them that what we must do, if we won, was take back all the privatised utilities at the same knock-down prices they were sold off by the Tories. It was a bloody crime. And then, I said, we should take Thatcher to court for what she'd done.'</p> <p>Fine, I say, gazing levelly back through the chopsticks of Manchester's Chinatown; and what was the precise problem with that? No punishment quite meet enough, I supposed; but no, his raised eyebrows and his silence tell me, I'm missing the point. Which is simple: this was 10 years ago.</p> <p>1992. Before Tony Blair, married to Booth's daughter Cherie, swooned into power, declared that the battle between Right and Left was dead, and within that very first week invited the same Margaret Thatcher for tea, a fact of which I now remind the other Tony in order to make him choke on his dim sum. He copes admirably. A nervous swallow, and then, 'Yes, yes, he did, didn't he? Hmmm. I suppose he was trying to be conciliatory. It, um, it didn't quite come off, did it?'</p> <p>1992. Before Booth had met Stephenie, his fourth wife, a mid-40s charmer who obviously adores the old rou\u00e9 and is now sitting at the same table and nudging him, openly elbowing, chopsticking him, to stop him saying something he shouldn't. 1992. Before Booth, with his hell-raising past of 'crumpeteering' and booze and bolting from women became a semi-legitimate target for the Daily Mail and its familiars, keen to pounce on any indiscretions likely to embarrass New Labour.</p> <p>So most mention of belief, principle, radicalism and the like is out of the question. It's not that he doesn't feel these things; it's just that he can't say them for fear of the press; I'm not sure whether this is a sadder indictment of the press or his party. But conscious of it all he undoubtedly is; a few days before he had written a diary for the New Statesman in which he ventured the opinion that some of our royals are thick and greedy. This 'crass behaviour' (\u00a9 Simon Heffer) had, the Mail went on to shriek, 'plunged into embarrassment' Tony Blair. Booth shakes his head. 'I know, I know. I don't get it either. Ageing socialist.' He turns to Stephenie in mock dismay: 'Oops, I've said the S-word!</p> <p>'Ageing socialist says he's not completely in love with the British monarchy shock! Of course they should be abolished. And the logical next step is the abolition of the House of Lords. But you even think about saying these things now, because of how everything is played.' Stephenie shushes him, wondering if he's said too much.</p> <p>That he buttons his lip these days is not because he's leant on by the party, he insists; and I tend to believe him, for this is a man for whom anti-authoritarianism is as natural as dreaming and twinkling and flirting. He spoke at one stage of his joy as his postwar generation erupted on to the stage and television, the untrained working-class oiks who loved acting so much they were willing to put up with any amount of death-rattle sneers from the middle-class establishment. 'After the war, we just thought, we've made it! We're alive, and we're not just going to do what you tell us any more!' I suspect any genuine party attempt to silence him would have the opposite effect. No, he says, Alastair hasn't had a word. 'Saw him recently; told him he was doing a bloody good acting job on that Rory Bremner thing.' The reaction? 'He laughed. Well, he laughed for Alastair, which means he told me to fuck off.'</p> <p>Rather, the strong impression is that his reticence is based on respect for Cherie, about whom he will say absolutely nothing, and, by extension, her husband.</p> <p>Already, over the years, his anger at disability benefits and the treatment of unions has been recorded, but he won't even rehash those thanks to fear of the constantly lurking chopsticks, other than saying: 'I think everything will change in the second term. He's a good man. At heart, Blair's a good man.'</p> <p>If he feels he owes Cherie, he's probably right. Stephenie, whom he met at a party, is his fourth wife (and he her fifth husband). He left Cherie's mother, sometime actress Gale Smith, for producer Julie Allan, by whom he had two more daughters. Then came Sixties model Pamela 'Suzie' Smith, mother of Lauren and Emma, and, incidentally, the end of his drinking, when he almost died after she locked him out one night; the attempt to climb in via unsteady paraffin drums meant months in hospital with vicious burns. He lived, and hit the wagon. Then there was the affair with Coronation Street 's Pat Phoenix, whom he married a week before her death.</p> <p>He doesn't talk easily about those times, for he sees himself, or likes to portray himself, as a changed man, mellowed and careful. There are flashes of old: the asides, the stories about nights with Sean Connery that leave him creased with laughter. And the drive behind it all wasn't just to be naughty: he was, he says, genuinely part of a time when the British working class grew to learn they had brains and talent and dreams, and the world seemed their oyster.</p> <p>'My father had had a bad accident at Cunard's. He broke his back, leg, arm, pelvis and skull. He should have died; my mother wouldn't let him. So I went to work, dull work, but I was also involved in am dram. And I remember learning from one guy that he was earning \u00a38 a week in rep. \u00a38! Beautiful! For doing something you enjoyed! That was me started.'</p> <p>He wished he'd done more, of course, and accepts that, for all the fun he had as the Scouse git in Till Death Us Do Part and various cheeky-Lothario parts, he was, in the end, typecast. He talks of the main beauty of acting, which is that, 'it's the only time in life that there's any certainty about what will happen'.</p> <p>He grows quieter. 'I mean, I don't have certainty about anything else, do I? Acting is probably the most important thing in my life. Euan's good, saw him in a school play; but I wouldn't advise him to go into it, because it's all about cheekbones rather than talent now.' Stephenie chimes in: 'You love acting more than politics?'</p> <p>'Yes, yes. You can do politics in acting. I'd like to change things, yes, but it's bloody difficult these days, I just have to accept that. I like to talk.'</p> <p>And on he talks. About the Normans, how it was 'all their fault. Before they came we had proper electoral democracy, used to go to moots and the rest, then after the Conquest everything became hereditary.

About the new politics, and a certain relish he holds for 'the great battle that's coming between the corporations and the people'. About the royals, again, and the unlikelihood of him being offered an honour, and the relish he would take in refusing it. 'Do you think I'd let the Queen anywhere near me with a sword? But, look. I talk. And I dream. It's part of me, part of the time I grew up in. But I'd be no good at the real stuff.'</p> <p>Probably not. It's not 1992; and it's certainly not 1962. A child of his times, and, despite the new diffidence, probably a child and a dreamer for ever. And politics, today, is strictly for those born one generation later.

Elected 1972 <br> <b>Now</b> Company director <p>Over tea in the Lords, where egg sandwiches are subsidised down to 90p, Norman Lamont admitted that he knew defeat was inevitable at least a year before the election. When the polls were predicting a 100-seat Labour majority, he ran into a pollster who doubted his own findings. 'I bet him \u00a3100 he was right.' Lord Lamont took a sip of his milkless Indian tea and smiled - a more engaging sight than you might imagine.</p> <p>But when did he know he was going to lose Harrogate, turning a 9,000 majority into a Lib-Dem one of 6,000? 'Fortunately, only three days before.' He arranged for a friend to make 'secret calls'. This deception revealed, he explained, the extent of the local alliance between the Liberals and Labour - whose vote actually went down. 'I'm a fairly fatalistic individual. I knew defeat was a possibility. And that confirmed it. I didn't have much time to reflect. I'd been through difficult times in the years before. It just seemed one more thing.'</p> <p>Things like the Miss Whiplash scandal. Things like being the chancellor who presided over Britain's departure from the ERM. Things like being dumped by Major. Things like watching Ken Clarke's chancellorship reap the plaudits that could have been his.</p> <p>'I never took defeat personally, even though I had a bigger than average swing against me. For Portillo, though, I think it was a personal thing.' There was no letter of condolence at all from Major. There were, though, phone calls from both Thatcher and Hague.</p> <p>'I didn't feel tremendous emotion at the moment of defeat. I felt sad, but not in a crushed way. Apart from anything else, I knew I'd come back here.' A slight gesture of the hand, almost but not quite a wave, indicating the Lords. 'If I'm not abroad on business I come here most days. It provides an element of continuity.' He does believe, though, that there should be a 'part-elected element' to the red-carpeted House.</p> <p>He is now a director of five companies and consultant to two others, with an office in Park Lane. He lectures, he writes, he runs a think-tank, he travels: Poland the week before we spoke, the US the following day. He's learned to use a computer - well, he can surf the web for research; he still can't type or do spreadsheets. He's struck up an unlikely friendship with Agriculture Minister Nick Brown - they would have been paired in this parliament.</p> <p>He's bought loads of CDs. 'I might become a Wagner fan. I want to go to Bayreuth.' He's thinking of learning Spanish, perhaps inspired by his campaign for few people's favourite Chilean, General Pinochet. 'It was unpopular but it provided a lot of interest for me.'</p> <p>What does he miss? 'The bustle, the excitement, the rudeness. This place is very quiet. I also rather wish I had constituents. Mail from them directs you. Not having it is like being without a compass.'</p> <p>A pause, a sip of his milkless tea. 'The fact that I make that remark shows I'm still interested in politics. I'm what you call a junkie.' Another sip, another smile.</p> <p><b>Gyles Brandreth</b><br> <b>Then</b> MP for City of Chester. Elected 1992<br> <b>Now</b> Journalist</p> <p>Gyles Brandreth saw it coming the way you see a truck coming. 'My defeat was no shock. I was in a marginal seat. I knew for a year before the election that I'd lose. I was resigned to it. You shouldn't take defeat personally, but you do. You know that the same tide that has swept out complete drunks and utter incompetents has also done for you, a good constituency MP.'</p> <p>So certain was the loss of his Chester seat that, well before the election, Conservative central office offered to find him another, safer one. Loyalty, he says, is what kept him from switching. That and a feeling that he'd be thought chicken. Not an anxiety you would have thought to trouble a man who has appeared on our television screens in some of history's most idiosyncratic fully fashioned knitwear.</p> <p>His wife was 'delighted' by the prospect of his defeat. As you would be when your husband has spent several years working 7.15am to midnight. 'That's a whip's life. Not much of a life, but a complete life.'</p> <p>He lived with the knowledge of impending disaster for month after month - while not being able to do anything about it. 'You can't be seen to be looking for a job.' He spent election day living 'a charade', still talking up his chances to anyone who'd listen, knowing he didn't stand a prayer. </p> <p>'English people are very pleasant. They say they'll vote for you even if they have no intention of doing so.'</p> <p>His wife was more realistic. She booked them a holiday in Sicily. 'It turned out to be one of the best of my life.' She also wanted to put their constituency house on the market before election day. He managed to dissuade her, briefly. 'But still, the result came at 2am, and by 10am she was at the estate agent's.'</p> <p>By the time he got back to his London base, there was already a letter on the mat, asking him to return his pass. 'That was harsh.' He was, however, allowed to keep his ministerial box. 'That's now in my Teddy Bear Museum in Stratford.' Tony Blair's old teddy, Lynton, sits on top of it. He returns to the House of Commons, occasionally, but doesn't feel completely comfortable. The first trip, in particular, was 'unnerving'.</p> <p>Life has changed in the obvious ways, bringing more time with the family and more money, probably. It also brought a possibly unexpected sense of freedom.</p> <p>'I don't miss having to be on my best behaviour at all times, having to watch what I say. If I'm asked to open a fete, I can turn it down. As an MP I only seemed to meet two kinds of people: those who had problems, and those who thought they knew the answer to everything.'</p> <p>What does he miss? Power: 'In the whips' office, you're not close to the centre. You are the centre.' The Palace of Westminster: 'The camaraderie of the club.' And, more than anything, the library: 'The far end, the European history section. It's the most beautiful spot overlooking the Thames. I shared a table with Mandelson.' His point was subtly clear: as they rise, so they fall.</p> <p><b>Derek Conway</b><br> <b>Then</b> MP for Shrewsbury. Elected 1983<br> <b>Now</b> Chief executive of the Cats Protection League and Conservative candidate</p> <p>Derek Conway grew up on a council estate, left school at 15, worked as a whip under Major, fell out with John Major and was, for a while, Vice Chamberlain to Her Majesty's Household. Every day, in formal dress, with a 5ft wand in hand, he'd give the Queen a briefing on what her parliament was up to. Not the stuff she could read in the paper, but the real skinny.

      "bodyText": "Lord Lamont Then MP for Harrogate and Knaresborough. Elected 1972 Now Company director Over tea in the Lords, where egg sandwiches are subsidised down to 90p, Norman Lamont admitted that he knew defeat was inevitable at least a year before the election. When the polls were predicting a 100-seat Labour majority, he ran into a pollster who doubted his own findings. 'I bet him \u00a3100 he was right.' Lord Lamont took a sip of his milkless Indian tea and smiled - a more engaging sight than you might imagine. But when did he know he was going to lose Harrogate, turning a 9,000 majority into a Lib-Dem one of 6,000? 'Fortunately, only three days before.' He arranged for a friend to make 'secret calls'. This deception revealed, he explained, the extent of the local alliance between the Liberals and Labour - whose vote actually went down. 'I'm a fairly fatalistic individual. I knew defeat was a possibility. And that confirmed it. I didn't have much time to reflect. I'd been through difficult times in the years before. It just seemed one more thing.' Things like the Miss Whiplash scandal. Things like being the chancellor who presided over Britain's departure from the ERM. Things like being dumped by Major. Things like watching Ken Clarke's chancellorship reap the plaudits that could have been his. 'I never took defeat personally, even though I had a bigger than average swing against me. For Portillo, though, I think it was a personal thing.' There was no letter of condolence at all from Major. There were, though, phone calls from both Thatcher and Hague. 'I didn't feel tremendous emotion at the moment of defeat. I felt sad, but not in a crushed way. Apart from anything else, I knew I'd come back here.' A slight gesture of the hand, almost but not quite a wave, indicating the Lords. 'If I'm not abroad on business I come here most days. It provides an element of continuity.' He does believe, though, that there should be a 'part-elected element' to the red-carpeted House. He is now a director of five companies and consultant to two others, with an office in Park Lane. He lectures, he writes, he runs a think-tank, he travels: Poland the week before we spoke, the US the following day. He's learned to use a computer - well, he can surf the web for research; he still can't type or do spreadsheets. He's struck up an unlikely friendship with Agriculture Minister Nick Brown - they would have been paired in this parliament. He's bought loads of CDs. 'I might become a Wagner fan. I want to go to Bayreuth.' He's thinking of learning Spanish, perhaps inspired by his campaign for few people's favourite Chilean, General Pinochet. 'It was unpopular but it provided a lot of interest for me.' What does he miss? 'The bustle, the excitement, the rudeness. This place is very quiet. I also rather wish I had constituents. Mail from them directs you. Not having it is like being without a compass.' A pause, a sip of his milkless tea. 'The fact that I make that remark shows I'm still interested in politics. I'm what you call a junkie.' Another sip, another smile. Gyles Brandreth Then MP for City of Chester. Elected 1992 Now Journalist Gyles Brandreth saw it coming the way you see a truck coming. 'My defeat was no shock. I was in a marginal seat. I knew for a year before the election that I'd lose. I was resigned to it. You shouldn't take defeat personally, but you do. You know that the same tide that has swept out complete drunks and utter incompetents has also done for you, a good constituency MP.' So certain was the loss of his Chester seat that, well before the election, Conservative central office offered to find him another, safer one. Loyalty, he says, is what kept him from switching. That and a feeling that he'd be thought chicken. Not an anxiety you would have thought to trouble a man who has appeared on our television screens in some of history's most idiosyncratic fully fashioned knitwear. His wife was 'delighted' by the prospect of his defeat. As you would be when your husband has spent several years working 7.15am to midnight. 'That's a whip's life. Not much of a life, but a complete life.' He lived with the knowledge of impending disaster for month after month - while not being able to do anything about it. 'You can't be seen to be looking for a job.' He spent election day living 'a charade', still talking up his chances to anyone who'd listen, knowing he didn't stand a prayer. 'English people are very pleasant. They say they'll vote for you even if they have no intention of doing so.' His wife was more realistic. She booked them a holiday in Sicily. 'It turned out to be one of the best of my life.' She also wanted to put their constituency house on the market before election day. He managed to dissuade her, briefly. 'But still, the result came at 2am, and by 10am she was at the estate agent's.' By the time he got back to his London base, there was already a letter on the mat, asking him to return his pass. 'That was harsh.' He was, however, allowed to keep his ministerial box. 'That's now in my Teddy Bear Museum in Stratford.' Tony Blair's old teddy, Lynton, sits on top of it. He returns to the House of Commons, occasionally, but doesn't feel completely comfortable. The first trip, in particular, was 'unnerving'. Life has changed in the obvious ways, bringing more time with the family and more money, probably. It also brought a possibly unexpected sense of freedom. 'I don't miss having to be on my best behaviour at all times, having to watch what I say. If I'm asked to open a fete, I can turn it down. As an MP I only seemed to meet two kinds of people: those who had problems, and those who thought they knew the answer to everything.' What does he miss? Power: 'In the whips' office, you're not close to the centre. You are the centre.' The Palace of Westminster: 'The camaraderie of the club.' And, more than anything, the library: 'The far end, the European history section. It's the most beautiful spot overlooking the Thames. I shared a table with Mandelson.' His point was subtly clear: as they rise, so they fall. Derek Conway Then MP for Shrewsbury. Elected 1983 Now Chief executive of the Cats Protection League and Conservative candidate Derek Conway grew up on a council estate, left school at 15, worked as a whip under Major, fell out with John Major and was, for a while, Vice Chamberlain to Her Majesty's Household. Every day, in formal dress, with a 5ft wand in hand, he'd give the Queen a briefing on what her parliament was up to. Not the stuff she could read in the paper, but the real skinny. 'Who's sleeping with who, who's going bankrupt.' We talked over a pint in the Swiss restaurant, right beneath the Department of the Environment. The first thing I noticed about him was his pink socks. Next I spotted his brown suede loafers and dark pink trousers. Then I remembered his nickname - Bulldog. He lost Shrewsbury by 1,670 votes. 'Before the count, I told my wife Colette that I was going down the tubes. But the first time I really knew I was going to lose was 9pm. I just thought: bugger that. It's important not to get bitter. Even if you've been beaten by a Labour nerd with no idea where London is, let alone the House of Commons. If Labour had thought they were going to win my seat, they would have put someone better in. That unreasonableness did hurt. 'The electorate was right to punish us, but it was a bit excessive. OK, you chastise a child, but you don't beat it senseless. That was just plain cruelty. Still, we did work pretty hard at losing that election.' The outer strength just about contains inner hurts. 'My wife found it harder. It was a test on our marriage, but Colette's a strong girl.' She is still angry that her husband didn't get the knighthood he was promised. 'I was on the first two lists, then taken off the third,' he shrugged. 'I hadn't had to do a CV for 23 years. And unfortunately the Queen doesn't give references. A whips job offers the ideal experience for becoming a blackmailer, but there's not much call.' Initially, he was a 'public affairs consultant' - what you and I call a lobbyist. 'But I wasn't used to the freelance mentality. I wanted a proper job with a salary.' So when a headhunter came calling, in October 1997, he was interested in what was being offered - chief executive of the Cats Protection League. But, like a heroin addict getting by on methadone, he still hankered after the real thing. 'I wasn't sure about going back into politics. My wife certainly wasn't sure. But it's in my blood.' When asked to apply for Alan Clark's Chelsea seat, he declined at first. 'I'm not natural Chelsea stuff.' Then he changed his mind and 'thoroughly enjoyed' himself. 'Maybe it would have been stressful if I thought I could actually win.' Energised, he secured the nomination for Ted Heath's supersafe Bexley seat. 'It was the fit I was looking for.' The Bulldog is on his way back. Liz Lynne Then MP for Rochdale. Elected 1992 Now MEP Liz Lynne, everyone will tell you, is the LibDem woman who cried when she lost her Rochdale seat. 'I didn't,' says the former actress and voice coach to Paddy Ashdown. 'It was a member of my local association who burst into tears. I was comforting her.' It could well have been Liz who was crying, though. She'd had just an hour and a half's warning of her defeat. She was eating fish and chips with Liberal giant Cyril Smith when a phone call from her agent brought the bad news. 'You're joking,' she said. 'I'm not,' he replied. 'I think you've lost by 4,000.' In a 'state of shock', she called her mother, who started sobbing. 'I was devastated. At the count, I told my agent not to touch me because I would cry.' Her emotional waters did finally break, though. What set her off was her neighbours' daughter who handed her a posy and said, 'Sorry.' It took a long time for the tears to stop.

      "body": "<p>I've been sacked and I've been dumped. But never in a town hall, in front of friends, family, supporters, enemies, journalists and television cameras. I'm not sure I could handle such public rejection. I'm not sure many of us could.</p> <p>But that is how beaten MPs must face defeat. And 1997 wasn't just an ordinary defeat, it was a massacre. We dumped 132 MPs, of whom 126 were Conservatives and seven were cabinet ministers - a modern record. 'Gobsmacking is the word,' said Sir Graham Bright, then Tory vice-chairman, whose 28,000 personalised letters to his constituents didn't stop him losing Luton South. John Major rang Bright at 7am on the day of the election and asked him to tell him the truth. Bright told him that they'd lose by 60 to 70 seats. 'If only we had. What hit everybody was the scale of the defeat.'</p> <p>As a US politician said: 'The people have spoken. The bastards.'</p> <p>So what happens next? What do you do with an ex-MP? Some of those who lost in 1997 have remained public figures. One has died, one has had a major stroke. A few have become Lords. Some are standing again. Many have retired - or taken early, face-saving retirement.</p> <p>Surprisingly, of all those approached about their defeat, only one declined to talk. Stand up, former Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, doing very well in the City but probably under some pressure since JP Morgan swallowed the merchant bank at which he is vice chairman, Investment Banking, Europe.</p> <p>No one seems to have trodden in the steps of Labour MP Alf Dubbs, who signed on the dole the first Monday after his 1987 defeat. Some have taken the opportunity to smell the roses - as former Derby North MP Greg Knight put it. Many more, though, have had to wake up and smell the coffee.</p> <p><b>Sir Malcolm Rifkind</b><br> <b>Then</b> MP for Edinburgh Pentlands. Elected 1974 <br> <b>Now</b> Business consultant and Conservative candidate</p> <p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind had been there since the start. He was a minister when the great Tory adventure began in 1979, and he was still a minister when it finished. 'I and three of my colleagues were the longest-serving ministers since Palmerston,' he said in that lawyerly way of his. There have always been two Rifkinds. The Rifkind who left a message on my answerphone one Sunday morning - sonorous, pompous even, the man you know from his Newsnight appearances. And the one I talked to - witty, intelligent, cosmopolitan. This is the Rifkind who managed to outlast a leader who hated him. 'We were never soul mates,' he said urbanely of Baroness Thatcher.</p> <p>This is also the Rifkind who is again being talked about, within the Tory party, as a potential future leader. The suggestion is that he would take over in the aftermath of the title fight between Hague and Portillo from which both will - inevitably - emerge mortally wounded.</p> <p>First, though, he has to get back into parliament. He's standing again for Edinburgh Pentlands, which he lost in 1997. 'My seat was never safe. Some of my colleagues in the Home Counties had bigger majorities than my total vote. The gap didn't narrow as the campaign went on. I was a potential victim, to put it mildly.' The wry, Scottish-Jewish Rifkind then gave way to the lawyerly one, with a delicately balanced double negative. 'I was not not upset, though.' The urbane, subtle one returned. 'Being a Scots Tory requires certain personality traits. And if you don't have them when you start, you certainly acquire them over the years.'</p> <p>He works as a consultant, mostly with oil companies with links to the Middle East. 'Even when working hard, it's different to being a minister. Last week I was in Romania. As a minister, it would have been wall-to-wall meetings. Instead, it was two meetings, a leisurely lunch and a free evening. The downside is that I believe we all work better under pressure.'</p> <p>The other reason he opted for the freelance life, of course, was because it left him free to re-enter the game. Why go back? 'There's no known cure,' he laughed.</p> <p><b>Phillip Oppenheim</b><br> <b>Then</b> MP for Amber Valley. Elected 1983<br> <b>Now</b> Bar owner</p> <p>'Sheer capitalism,' explained Phillip Oppenheim when I asked the ex-Tory MP about the two AK-47s on his walls and the picture of Che Guevara in his toilet.</p> <p>Such is the decor of Cubana, the Cuban bar he owns and runs. It sits, very brightly, on a corner by the tradesman's entrance to Waterloo station, about a 10 minutes' walk from the House where Oppenheim sat till he lost his Amber Valley seat. He describes its style as 'post-Communist grunge' - laughingly but seriously.</p> <p>As we sat drinking mojitos - the national rum, mint and sugar cocktail of Communism's only sun-kissed paradise - we were joined by another ex-Tory MP, Tony Coombs, a major investor in Cubana. His thoughts on the irony of a Thatcherite Tory running a Cuban-themed bar filled with Marxist revolutionary bric-a-bric? 'Business is business is business.'</p> <p>Oppenheim said he knew his party was heading for defeat as early as 1992. 'We'd lost credibility.' But he only realised he'd lose his own seat in the last weekend of the campaign. 'I was a bit thick.'</p> <p>For Oppenheim, the 1997 election was a light-hearted affair. 'We didn't think about defeat much. It was a fun campaign. You try to be gracious. The Labour lot made an effort not to be nasty. You don't bust a gut. We did lots of pub quizzes. We hoped against hope that something would happen, but it didn't. It was like saying goodbye to an old dog - a pleasant campaign.'</p> <p>The moment of defeat? 'I was young when I won in 1983, and it was a burden of responsibility. Defeat in 1997 was like having a weight taken off my shoulders. From a career point of view, it would have been better to have lost in 1992. The upside was that I was Ken Clarke's PPS.' In a 'very depressing' government, he also spent time in Michael Portillo's department. 'I always hated him before, thought he was a smug git, but working with him was a pleasant surprise.' His time in Ann Widdecombe's department was less pleasant. 'She'd literally slap my wrists after meetings.'</p> <p>In 1992, when he thought he'd lose his seat, he laid plans to go into the sushi business. By the time he really did lose, he still fancied the restaurant business but sushi was everywhere. So he needed a new trick. He found it on a trip to Cuba and opened the bar a year after the elect- ion, with 'freshly made juices, free-range chicken, old-style Cajun cooking and premium spirits'. A second opened last month. There are plans for a chain. 'We've just got to cruising altitude.'</p> <p>Still, how does he square the circle between Conservatism in his heart and Cuban guerrilla chic in his bar? 'I have no sympathy for Castro. He's only interested in power for power's sake. But Che had ideals. He was a doctor who'd travelled around on his motorbike and worked with lepers. It's true that later he became a brutal zealot, but he was never a political hack.'</p> <p>And he met more than a few of those in his own party. 'It was always the po-faced guys who rose to the top,' he said, still surprisingly hurt after all these years. For him, politics is almost certainly in the past. He was asked to stand again but declined the offer. 'If it gets more liberal, I might be interested. If Ann Widdecombe ever became leader, I'd vote New Labour.'</p> <p><b>Gerry Malone</b><br> <b>Then</b> MP for Winchester. Elected 1992<br> <b>Now</b> Non-executive company director</p> <p>Gerry Malone lost Winchester by just two votes after two recounts. Then he lost it again a few months later in a rerun election - by 21,556. Politics is a tough game, of course. But it's an even tougher game than you may think. Another Conservative politico claimed to me - almost proudly - that he knew, personally, the two voters who'd swung Gerry Malone's seat by switching to the Lib Dems. Nor did he blame them: he'd have done the same if Gerry Malone had been his MP.</p> <p>People don't like Gerry Malone much. He's seen as arrogant, unclubbable. 'I had few friends in politics and it remains so.' He's a pal of Andrew Neil's. John Major's, too. He's a left-winger in a party now run by rightbacks. He's a Scotsman living in London. He speaks with Caledonian certainty, and rectitude, in a world debased - or blessed - by the art of compromise. Unlike other ex-MPs, he doesn't miss 'the House', but he does miss power. He genuinely adored being a minister in the Department of Health and still talks with great passion about it.</p> <p>How did it feel being dumped by the electorate? 'A nightmare. I felt like the victim of a road traffic accident.' As he engagingly admits, losing was no little achievement. Over the two elections, he managed to convert a Tory marginal into the safest Lib Dem seat in the land. 'Probably in recorded history,' he added. 'I certainly didn't expect the scale of the defeat. And I couldn't claim a 21,000 majority was a result of the weather.'</p> <p>At the count, he was calm to the world, but his private self was already doing the maths. 'What's my resettlement allowance?' he was asking himself. 'Divide that by my monthly mortgage. Works out at six months to put it right.' As he prides himself in doing, he was dealing with 'the practicalities'.</p> <p>'Anyone who's not practical will founder. Survival is the first thing. Nor did I burst into tears in private. My wife Anne and I never had a discussion about it. There are some things you don't discuss.'</p> <p>Was there self-doubt? 'Yes.' Disappointment? 'There must be a degree of disappointment when 20 years of work dissolves into dust.' Pain? 'My wife is a consultant anaesthetist and I felt like imbibing some of her products at points.'</p> <p>To pay the mortgage, the school fees and music tuition bills, he returned to journalism for 12 months, working on the ill-fated European with his friend Andrew Neil. An 'odd interlude' is his polite turn of phrase for a period that involved a chilling dunk in controversy over an altercation with a female journalist. Then he turned to the health business, making understandable use of the knowledge and contacts he'd built up as minister - something the rules barred him from doing for two years. He now has a non-executive role in several companies, including Regent GM Laboratories, Ultrasis and Chiltern Invodex.</p> <p>They don't employ him because they like his suits or his soft Edinburgh accent, of course. 'Practical crossover from my ministerial job,' is how he puts it. Also: 'One's income is considerably in excess of what it was. To replace the zing of politics is difficult, though.'</p> <p>How involved is he now? 'I support my local party by going to the odd function.' No canvassing, though. 'Life has moved on.'</p> <p><b>Michael Brown</b><br> <b> Then</b> MP for Cleethorpes. Elected 1979<br> <b>Now</b> Journalist</p> <p>It was over lunch at the Reform Club that number 481 in The Pink Paper's Top 500 lesbian and gay heroes, former Tory whip Michael Brown, talked about being dumped by his Cleethorpes constituents.</p> <p>He chose the venue. The Reform is a deeply political place. Michael Brown is a deeply political man.</p> <p>When he spotted Labour Transport Minister Lord MacDonald in the club's grand central hall, his childish delight was infectious. Later, he had a chat with Sir Alan Peacock, his old economics professor. All that, a good lunch and a brace of G&amp;Ts: Mr Michael Brown, a left-handed right-winger who was outed by the News of the World in 1994 some years after he'd outed himself - was having a very good day. For him, politics is what water is to fish: pretty much everything.</p> <p>A secondary-school boy driven by his 11-plus failure, he wanted to be a Tory MP from the age of 16. His only civilian job was as a graduate trainee for Barclays. 'I hated it every day.' A job as a Conservative Party researcher led to a shot at the very marginal seat of Cleethorpes and an unexpected win in the 1983 landslide. He was 27. 'I was one of Thatcher's kids.' He turns 50 this July.</p> <p>When did he know he was going to lose? 'My bank manager tells me it was 1992. He noticed that I became more financially responsible. Personally, I knew from 1993. We fell out of the ERM and I was notified of boundary changes in my seat.' He stopped buying 'new cars, etc', and by the election had paid his debts. The bright sunny day of the election was 'unreal', he recalled. 'It hit you that you were utterly down the toilet. People's glances never met yours. But I can say there was no shock. It was a release. I'd been in an awful government, waiting for the Sword of Damocles. You know you're going to die. You just want the bloody thing to happen.

Like other dumped Tories, he had to tell himself what he'd told 20,000 redundant steelworkers - you're on your own now, mate. 'It was not a pleasant place to be. I'd never done a proper job before.

      "bodyText": "I've been sacked and I've been dumped. But never in a town hall, in front of friends, family, supporters, enemies, journalists and television cameras. I'm not sure I could handle such public rejection. I'm not sure many of us could. But that is how beaten MPs must face defeat. And 1997 wasn't just an ordinary defeat, it was a massacre. We dumped 132 MPs, of whom 126 were Conservatives and seven were cabinet ministers - a modern record. 'Gobsmacking is the word,' said Sir Graham Bright, then Tory vice-chairman, whose 28,000 personalised letters to his constituents didn't stop him losing Luton South. John Major rang Bright at 7am on the day of the election and asked him to tell him the truth. Bright told him that they'd lose by 60 to 70 seats. 'If only we had. What hit everybody was the scale of the defeat.' As a US politician said: 'The people have spoken. The bastards.' So what happens next? What do you do with an ex-MP? Some of those who lost in 1997 have remained public figures. One has died, one has had a major stroke. A few have become Lords. Some are standing again. Many have retired - or taken early, face-saving retirement. Surprisingly, of all those approached about their defeat, only one declined to talk. Stand up, former Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, doing very well in the City but probably under some pressure since JP Morgan swallowed the merchant bank at which he is vice chairman, Investment Banking, Europe. No one seems to have trodden in the steps of Labour MP Alf Dubbs, who signed on the dole the first Monday after his 1987 defeat. Some have taken the opportunity to smell the roses - as former Derby North MP Greg Knight put it. Many more, though, have had to wake up and smell the coffee. Sir Malcolm Rifkind Then MP for Edinburgh Pentlands. Elected 1974 Now Business consultant and Conservative candidate Sir Malcolm Rifkind had been there since the start. He was a minister when the great Tory adventure began in 1979, and he was still a minister when it finished. 'I and three of my colleagues were the longest-serving ministers since Palmerston,' he said in that lawyerly way of his. There have always been two Rifkinds. The Rifkind who left a message on my answerphone one Sunday morning - sonorous, pompous even, the man you know from his Newsnight appearances. And the one I talked to - witty, intelligent, cosmopolitan. This is the Rifkind who managed to outlast a leader who hated him. 'We were never soul mates,' he said urbanely of Baroness Thatcher. This is also the Rifkind who is again being talked about, within the Tory party, as a potential future leader. The suggestion is that he would take over in the aftermath of the title fight between Hague and Portillo from which both will - inevitably - emerge mortally wounded. First, though, he has to get back into parliament. He's standing again for Edinburgh Pentlands, which he lost in 1997. 'My seat was never safe. Some of my colleagues in the Home Counties had bigger majorities than my total vote. The gap didn't narrow as the campaign went on. I was a potential victim, to put it mildly.' The wry, Scottish-Jewish Rifkind then gave way to the lawyerly one, with a delicately balanced double negative. 'I was not not upset, though.' The urbane, subtle one returned. 'Being a Scots Tory requires certain personality traits. And if you don't have them when you start, you certainly acquire them over the years.' He works as a consultant, mostly with oil companies with links to the Middle East. 'Even when working hard, it's different to being a minister. Last week I was in Romania. As a minister, it would have been wall-to-wall meetings. Instead, it was two meetings, a leisurely lunch and a free evening. The downside is that I believe we all work better under pressure.' The other reason he opted for the freelance life, of course, was because it left him free to re-enter the game. Why go back? 'There's no known cure,' he laughed. Phillip Oppenheim Then MP for Amber Valley. Elected 1983 Now Bar owner 'Sheer capitalism,' explained Phillip Oppenheim when I asked the ex-Tory MP about the two AK-47s on his walls and the picture of Che Guevara in his toilet. Such is the decor of Cubana, the Cuban bar he owns and runs. It sits, very brightly, on a corner by the tradesman's entrance to Waterloo station, about a 10 minutes' walk from the House where Oppenheim sat till he lost his Amber Valley seat. He describes its style as 'post-Communist grunge' - laughingly but seriously. As we sat drinking mojitos - the national rum, mint and sugar cocktail of Communism's only sun-kissed paradise - we were joined by another ex-Tory MP, Tony Coombs, a major investor in Cubana. His thoughts on the irony of a Thatcherite Tory running a Cuban-themed bar filled with Marxist revolutionary bric-a-bric? 'Business is business is business.' Oppenheim said he knew his party was heading for defeat as early as 1992. 'We'd lost credibility.' But he only realised he'd lose his own seat in the last weekend of the campaign. 'I was a bit thick.' For Oppenheim, the 1997 election was a light-hearted affair. 'We didn't think about defeat much. It was a fun campaign. You try to be gracious. The Labour lot made an effort not to be nasty. You don't bust a gut. We did lots of pub quizzes. We hoped against hope that something would happen, but it didn't. It was like saying goodbye to an old dog - a pleasant campaign.' The moment of defeat? 'I was young when I won in 1983, and it was a burden of responsibility. Defeat in 1997 was like having a weight taken off my shoulders. From a career point of view, it would have been better to have lost in 1992. The upside was that I was Ken Clarke's PPS.' In a 'very depressing' government, he also spent time in Michael Portillo's department. 'I always hated him before, thought he was a smug git, but working with him was a pleasant surprise.' His time in Ann Widdecombe's department was less pleasant. 'She'd literally slap my wrists after meetings.' In 1992, when he thought he'd lose his seat, he laid plans to go into the sushi business. By the time he really did lose, he still fancied the restaurant business but sushi was everywhere. So he needed a new trick. He found it on a trip to Cuba and opened the bar a year after the elect- ion, with 'freshly made juices, free-range chicken, old-style Cajun cooking and premium spirits'. A second opened last month. There are plans for a chain. 'We've just got to cruising altitude.' Still, how does he square the circle between Conservatism in his heart and Cuban guerrilla chic in his bar? 'I have no sympathy for Castro. He's only interested in power for power's sake. But Che had ideals. He was a doctor who'd travelled around on his motorbike and worked with lepers. It's true that later he became a brutal zealot, but he was never a political hack.' And he met more than a few of those in his own party. 'It was always the po-faced guys who rose to the top,' he said, still surprisingly hurt after all these years. For him, politics is almost certainly in the past. He was asked to stand again but declined the offer. 'If it gets more liberal, I might be interested. If Ann Widdecombe ever became leader, I'd vote New Labour.' Gerry Malone Then MP for Winchester. Elected 1992 Now Non-executive company director Gerry Malone lost Winchester by just two votes after two recounts. Then he lost it again a few months later in a rerun election - by 21,556. Politics is a tough game, of course. But it's an even tougher game than you may think. Another Conservative politico claimed to me - almost proudly - that he knew, personally, the two voters who'd swung Gerry Malone's seat by switching to the Lib Dems. Nor did he blame them: he'd have done the same if Gerry Malone had been his MP. People don't like Gerry Malone much. He's seen as arrogant, unclubbable. 'I had few friends in politics and it remains so.' He's a pal of Andrew Neil's. John Major's, too. He's a left-winger in a party now run by rightbacks. He's a Scotsman living in London. He speaks with Caledonian certainty, and rectitude, in a world debased - or blessed - by the art of compromise. Unlike other ex-MPs, he doesn't miss 'the House', but he does miss power. He genuinely adored being a minister in the Department of Health and still talks with great passion about it. How did it feel being dumped by the electorate? 'A nightmare. I felt like the victim of a road traffic accident.' As he engagingly admits, losing was no little achievement. Over the two elections, he managed to convert a Tory marginal into the safest Lib Dem seat in the land. 'Probably in recorded history,' he added. 'I certainly didn't expect the scale of the defeat. And I couldn't claim a 21,000 majority was a result of the weather.' At the count, he was calm to the world, but his private self was already doing the maths. 'What's my resettlement allowance?' he was asking himself. 'Divide that by my monthly mortgage. Works out at six months to put it right.' As he prides himself in doing, he was dealing with 'the practicalities'. 'Anyone who's not practical will founder. Survival is the first thing. Nor did I burst into tears in private. My wife Anne and I never had a discussion about it. There are some things you don't discuss.' Was there self-doubt? 'Yes.' Disappointment? 'There must be a degree of disappointment when 20 years of work dissolves into dust.' Pain? 'My wife is a consultant anaesthetist and I felt like imbibing some of her products at points.' To pay the mortgage, the school fees and music tuition bills, he returned to journalism for 12 months, working on the ill-fated European with his friend Andrew Neil. An 'odd interlude' is his polite turn of phrase for a period that involved a chilling dunk in controversy over an altercation with a female journalist. Then he turned to the health business, making understandable use of the knowledge and contacts he'd built up as minister - something the rules barred him from doing for two years. He now has a non-executive role in several companies, including Regent GM Laboratories, Ultrasis and Chiltern Invodex. They don't employ him because they like his suits or his soft Edinburgh accent, of course. 'Practical crossover from my ministerial job,' is how he puts it. Also: 'One's income is considerably in excess of what it was. To replace the zing of politics is difficult, though.' How involved is he now? 'I support my local party by going to the odd function.' No canvassing, though. 'Life has moved on.' Michael Brown Then MP for Cleethorpes. Elected 1979 Now Journalist It was over lunch at the Reform Club that number 481 in The Pink Paper's Top 500 lesbian and gay heroes, former Tory whip Michael Brown, talked about being dumped by his Cleethorpes constituents. He chose the venue. The Reform is a deeply political place. Michael Brown is a deeply political man. When he spotted Labour Transport Minister Lord MacDonald in the club's grand central hall, his childish delight was infectious. Later, he had a chat with Sir Alan Peacock, his old economics professor. All that, a good lunch and a brace of G&amp;Ts: Mr Michael Brown, a left-handed right-winger who was outed by the News of the World in 1994 some years after he'd outed himself - was having a very good day. For him, politics is what water is to fish: pretty much everything. A secondary-school boy driven by his 11-plus failure, he wanted to be a Tory MP from the age of 16. His only civilian job was as a graduate trainee for Barclays. 'I hated it every day.' A job as a Conservative Party researcher led to a shot at the very marginal seat of Cleethorpes and an unexpected win in the 1983 landslide. He was 27. 'I was one of Thatcher's kids.' He turns 50 this July. When did he know he was going to lose? 'My bank manager tells me it was 1992. He noticed that I became more financially responsible. Personally, I knew from 1993. We fell out of the ERM and I was notified of boundary changes in my seat.' He stopped buying 'new cars, etc', and by the election had paid his debts. The bright sunny day of the election was 'unreal', he recalled. 'It hit you that you were utterly down the toilet. People's glances never met yours. But I can say there was no shock. It was a release. I'd been in an awful government, waiting for the Sword of Damocles. You know you're going to die. You just want the bloody thing to happen. If there was an emptiness, it came two weeks later at the state opening of parliament. That was my wake-up moment.' Then came the sympathy letters. Thatcher wrote the next day. 'A personal note.' There was also a hand-written one from Ann Widdecombe. 'Her views are loopy, but we have a friendship. Of all the letters, hers was the most genuine and decent.' Finally, two months later, came a note from Major. 'Pro forma, computer-generated.' Brown's eyebrows arched upwards in distaste at the lack of courtesy. An endowment mortgage of \u00a332,000 matured during the campaign. 'So, with my redundancy payment, I had a cushion of \u00a350,000. It prevented me panicking. But I did fear that it would have to last me till I was selling the Big Issue.' His constituency house was up for sale within 24 hours - though it didn't sell for nine months. 'I was bleeding \u00a31,500 for the mortgage every four weeks. I was terrified. The really horrible bit came in late May. I thought I didn't have a friend in the world.' He had no kids or family to support - or to support him. 'Just my boyfriend's shoulder.' Like other dumped Tories, he had to tell himself what he'd told 20,000 redundant steelworkers - you're on your own now, mate. 'It was not a pleasant place to be. I'd never done a proper job before. I had a stack of cash, but not a clue what I was going to do.' For a while, like other dumped Tories, he worked for former MP David Evans' contract cleaning firm - not scrubbing, of course, but drumming up business. 'I wouldn't say I was a great success.' Eventually, at the time of the 1998 local elections, a piece of writing led him to political journalism. After 18 years in the House, he now taunts Hague from the pages of the Independent. He still worries that it will all go wrong, that he'll collapse into penury. But he clearly loves the life he lives. 'If you offered me a safe seat, I wouldn't go back.

      "body": "<p>When a smiling William Hague shook hands with Gurbux Singh in his wood-panelled parliamentary office on the eve of Valentine's Day, neither man could have imagined the trouble that would follow.</p> <p>The purpose of the meeting was to arrange the signing of a Commission for Racial Equality pledge by all the party leaders not to play the race card during the election. Singh, the chairman of the CRE, arrived with Robin Bannerji, his press spokesman. Hague was accompanied by chief of staff Sebastian Coe and Tory vice-chairman Tim Collins. Over coffee and biscuits they discussed the 'compact' on the table in front of them.</p> <p>Hague said he agreed 'with the princi ples'. Singh said it would be important that other MPs should be invited to sign up. Hague agreed, was shown the document and requested no changes.</p> <p>After less than an hour of polite discussion, Singh and Bannerji left the meeting. They were happy. And Hague was happy.</p> <p>But unknown to the five who gathered in Hague's office, they had just lit a fuse. It was connected to the incendiary issue of race which is suddenly at the centre of the political debate in Britain. Both Labour and the Tories have been engulfed: Michael Portillo has said he will not sign the CRE document, Robin Cook has spoken of Britain's chicken tikka massala culture.</p> <p>Long lists of prospective parliamentary candidates' thoughts on asylum and immigration have peppered the papers. Tory MPs have been queueing up to denounce the CRE as a jumped-up organisation which is engaged in a McCarthyite witch hunt to root out 'racists'. And suddenly race, the most delicate of issues, is being batted about in the foghorn language of party political war just over a month away from a general election.</p> <p>In the cold sunshine of an early spring day, Harrogate waited for the hordes to arrive. It was March, and Hague was about to give his keynote speech to the conference, ostensibly about Europe.</p> <p>'Let me take you on a journey to a foreign land - to Britain after a second term of Tony Blair,' Hague told delegates. The 'foreign land' line had been hastily concocted by speechwriter George Osborne and press secretary Nick Wood to feed journalists in advance, and wasn't even linked to a later passage on asylum seekers.</p> <p>But it became the leitmotif. Critics said Hague was suggesting that Britain was in danger of becoming a foreign land because of immigration. Hague insisted he was only talking about Europe. Many didn't believe him.</p> <p>Then, from the right-wing fringes of the Tory party, came John Townend and his views on preserving Anglo-Saxon culture. Townend had told a local party meeting: 'Our homogenous Anglo-Saxon society has been seriously undermined by the massive immigration - particularly Commonwealth immigration - that has taken place since the war. Illegal immigrants have got a new ploy. They call themselves asylum-seekers. In my view the only way to deal with the problem is to send them back quickly.'</p> <p>That brought the row right to the door of Central Office, raising questions over how far its MPs were under its control. Hague is now locked in bitter recriminations, not just with the CRE - which his camp accuses of changing the goalposts on the deal, accusations emphatically denied - but with some of his own colleagues. His leadership is in question once again.</p> <p>'I think the co-location of \"foreign land\" and stuff about asylum-seekers in the same speech is seen by most people as a mistake,' said one shadow cabinet Minister. 'And I think those responsible for the speech would agree with the benefit of hindsight.'</p> <p>But the real fear now gripping thoughtful Tories is not that the party has foolishly let itself be portrayed as racist, but that the leader's inner circle may not care how it looks if the voters and the right-wing press are happy. 'The awful thing is that some of these people around Hague probably think this is playing well for us,' said one Tory veteran.</p> <p>'And the sadness for me is that a lot of this is absolutely playing to what some people undoubtedly think. Why did he not withdraw the whip from Townend? Because he was worried that too many potential Tory voters would say \"but I agreed with him\".'</p> <p>But if it was the Right that led Hague into trouble, ironically it is the liberal wing of the party that is working hardest to get him off the hook. The first decisive intervention was the pro-European backbencher John Gummer's attack on the 'unconstitutional' CRE pledge on Friday morning. The second was the tireless trawling of TV studios by two instinctive liberals on race issues, party chairman Michael Ancram and his deputy Steve Norris, arguing that because Hague had signed on behalf of the party, ordinary MPs didn't have to.</p> <p>And the third was Michael Portillo, the Shadow Chancellor, declaring on a visit to Cardiff: 'I don't think we should be drawn into committing ourselves to sign up to every apparently well-intentioned declaration.' The headlines howled of another split: Hague had signed, but Portillo wouldn't. Surely a shameless bid to woo the Right? But what Portillo was actually doing was giving covering fire to his good friend Norris and to Ancram. Powerless to make the three CRE refuseniks - Townend, James Cran and Eric Forth - actually sign, the party was trying the Spartacus defence instead, insisting that almost everyone was a rebel, too. Even Ann Widdecombe, who has signed the pledge, issued a statement suggesting that she disapproved of the exercise.</p> <p>But the farce at Central Office is only one part of the question. Another is whether the CRE could have erred tactically in organising its campaign. And a third is whether Labour's staunch response - from Robin Cook's 'chicken tikka massala' theory of the benefits of multiculturalism to the streetfighting Minister Ian McCartney - is entirely without risk.</p> <p>When the nation's billboards were suddenly stripped of a Tory poster depicting a young black man and his son under the slogan 'You've paid the taxes so where are all the teachers?' - to be replaced by a poster starring a white-looking man - Millbank apparatchiks scented blood.</p> <p>Surely, they thought, the poster was dumped because the Tories were afraid to use blacks. This was the line Labour spin doctors suggested to journalists. But there was only one problem: they were wrong.</p> <p>The poster was actually pulped after complaints by the man's ex-wife about the use of their son: and the new model was actually of non-British origin. It seems that playing the anti-racist card can also backfire.</p> <p>Robin Cook has genuinely strong per sonal feelings about racism. So in the political limbo caused by the delayed election, one idea dusted off to keep the restless Foreign Secretary busy was a speech on multiculturalism.</p> <p>His aide David Clark had spotted before Christmas a survey saying that chicken tikka massala was now the nation's favourite dish, For Clark, the idea of the Indian tikka mixed with an inauthentic massala sauce to satisfy Britons' love of gravy was a useful metaphor.</p> <p>But then, on the eve of the speech, newspapers began reporting Townend's refusal to sign the CRE compact. Clark was hastily summoned to add more lines recalling Ancram's warning to Tories not to overstep the mark.</p> <p>'Coming to terms with multiculturalism as a positive force for our economy and society will have significant implications for our understanding of Britishness,' Cook concluded. It was misreading history to believe otherwise.</p> <p>The Daily Mail howled its outrage at his suggestion that there was no such thing as a 'British' race, in a story that helped convince Conservative Central Office that its cause against the CRE might not be so unpopular. But as far as Labour was concerned, it had worked. The rest of the press gobbled up the curry metaphor, and when Cook arrived for a lunch at the Mirror newspaper's east London offices on Thursday, he was offered a plate of chicken tikka massala.</p> <p>'The Tories have a real problem with race,' said one leading Labour campaign manager. 'They twist one way and the other, trying to satisfy the superficial need to appear non-racist while stoking up their core support. It is a good issue for us.'</p> <p>Party officials, however, will bear in mind the Metropolitan Police's findings, revealed today by The Observer, that provocative speeches on immigration can trigger hate crime.</p> <p>Critics will say that the Government's own record on asylum issues and race is far from impressive. Just two of the 12 new ethnic minority candidates standing in the forthcoming election will do so in a winnable seat. 'We might be paying lip service to the issue but in fact we are going backwards,' said Diane Abbott, the black Labour MP and veteran campaigner. 'If you look at the 1980s there were more black and Asian Labour candidates and more black and Asian Labour councillors.'</p> <p>It is all a far cry from the autumn of 1997, when Tony Blair - still basking in the warmth of victory - told the Labour party conference in Brighton that he wanted to be a beacon of meritocracy to the world. 'Not one black High Court judge, not one black Chief Constable or Permanent Secretary, not one black army officer above the rank of Colonel. Not one Asian either,' he said. 'Not a record of pride for the British establishment. And not a record of pride for Parliament that there are so few black and Asian MPs.'</p> <p>Little has changed since then, in Westminster at least, and there are calls on the ground for less fine talk and more action. The number of ethnic minority MPs will probably only rise by one in June. The Foreign Office still boasts no black ambassadors. Abbott points out that Labour's Millbank HQ itself boasts 'rows and rows of young white people and very few black and Asian faces'.</p> <p>A letter dropped onto William Hague's desk a week after the signing of the CRE compact on 14 March. The CRE 'did not intend to police the signing of the compact by individual MPs or candidates', it said, but it wanted to know which ones supported the pledge. Could Hague encourage his MPs to sign?</p> <p>Hague's response was noncommittal, enclosing a copy of party chairman Ancram's letter to all candidates reminding them to watch their language and warning that candidates 'may also be invited to sign the compact in their own constituencies'.</p> <p>Hague's closest aides are adamant that they had an understanding from the CRE that individual MPs would not be singled out for refusing to sign the compact. Although it had been used in 1997, it was just the party leaders who had signed up then. Expecting all MPs to adhere to the document had been seen as too officious.</p> <p>'We were taken aback to find the names of MPs who have refused to sign appearing in newspapers,' said one senior source last week. 'That was not the terms of the agreement.'</p> <p>The CRE only gave a few hours' notice on Thursday that it was posting results on its website. But the organisation - backed by the Liberal Democrats - is adamant that it was obvious from the start that the signatures would be publicised. 'We had never said this was going to be a closed process,' said a spokesman. 'If people asked for the figures, were we really going to say, no, it's confidential? That would have been ridiculous.'</p> <p>Either way, the row looks unlikely to go away.

      "bodyText": "When a smiling William Hague shook hands with Gurbux Singh in his wood-panelled parliamentary office on the eve of Valentine's Day, neither man could have imagined the trouble that would follow. The purpose of the meeting was to arrange the signing of a Commission for Racial Equality pledge by all the party leaders not to play the race card during the election. Singh, the chairman of the CRE, arrived with Robin Bannerji, his press spokesman. Hague was accompanied by chief of staff Sebastian Coe and Tory vice-chairman Tim Collins. Over coffee and biscuits they discussed the 'compact' on the table in front of them. Hague said he agreed 'with the princi ples'. Singh said it would be important that other MPs should be invited to sign up. Hague agreed, was shown the document and requested no changes. After less than an hour of polite discussion, Singh and Bannerji left the meeting. They were happy. And Hague was happy. But unknown to the five who gathered in Hague's office, they had just lit a fuse. It was connected to the incendiary issue of race which is suddenly at the centre of the political debate in Britain. Both Labour and the Tories have been engulfed: Michael Portillo has said he will not sign the CRE document, Robin Cook has spoken of Britain's chicken tikka massala culture. Long lists of prospective parliamentary candidates' thoughts on asylum and immigration have peppered the papers. Tory MPs have been queueing up to denounce the CRE as a jumped-up organisation which is engaged in a McCarthyite witch hunt to root out 'racists'. And suddenly race, the most delicate of issues, is being batted about in the foghorn language of party political war just over a month away from a general election. In the cold sunshine of an early spring day, Harrogate waited for the hordes to arrive. It was March, and Hague was about to give his keynote speech to the conference, ostensibly about Europe. 'Let me take you on a journey to a foreign land - to Britain after a second term of Tony Blair,' Hague told delegates. The 'foreign land' line had been hastily concocted by speechwriter George Osborne and press secretary Nick Wood to feed journalists in advance, and wasn't even linked to a later passage on asylum seekers. But it became the leitmotif. Critics said Hague was suggesting that Britain was in danger of becoming a foreign land because of immigration. Hague insisted he was only talking about Europe. Many didn't believe him. Then, from the right-wing fringes of the Tory party, came John Townend and his views on preserving Anglo-Saxon culture. Townend had told a local party meeting: 'Our homogenous Anglo-Saxon society has been seriously undermined by the massive immigration - particularly Commonwealth immigration - that has taken place since the war. Illegal immigrants have got a new ploy. They call themselves asylum-seekers. In my view the only way to deal with the problem is to send them back quickly.' That brought the row right to the door of Central Office, raising questions over how far its MPs were under its control. Hague is now locked in bitter recriminations, not just with the CRE - which his camp accuses of changing the goalposts on the deal, accusations emphatically denied - but with some of his own colleagues. His leadership is in question once again. 'I think the co-location of \"foreign land\" and stuff about asylum-seekers in the same speech is seen by most people as a mistake,' said one shadow cabinet Minister. 'And I think those responsible for the speech would agree with the benefit of hindsight.' But the real fear now gripping thoughtful Tories is not that the party has foolishly let itself be portrayed as racist, but that the leader's inner circle may not care how it looks if the voters and the right-wing press are happy. 'The awful thing is that some of these people around Hague probably think this is playing well for us,' said one Tory veteran. 'And the sadness for me is that a lot of this is absolutely playing to what some people undoubtedly think. Why did he not withdraw the whip from Townend? Because he was worried that too many potential Tory voters would say \"but I agreed with him\".' But if it was the Right that led Hague into trouble, ironically it is the liberal wing of the party that is working hardest to get him off the hook. The first decisive intervention was the pro-European backbencher John Gummer's attack on the 'unconstitutional' CRE pledge on Friday morning. The second was the tireless trawling of TV studios by two instinctive liberals on race issues, party chairman Michael Ancram and his deputy Steve Norris, arguing that because Hague had signed on behalf of the party, ordinary MPs didn't have to. And the third was Michael Portillo, the Shadow Chancellor, declaring on a visit to Cardiff: 'I don't think we should be drawn into committing ourselves to sign up to every apparently well-intentioned declaration.' The headlines howled of another split: Hague had signed, but Portillo wouldn't. Surely a shameless bid to woo the Right? But what Portillo was actually doing was giving covering fire to his good friend Norris and to Ancram. Powerless to make the three CRE refuseniks - Townend, James Cran and Eric Forth - actually sign, the party was trying the Spartacus defence instead, insisting that almost everyone was a rebel, too. Even Ann Widdecombe, who has signed the pledge, issued a statement suggesting that she disapproved of the exercise. But the farce at Central Office is only one part of the question. Another is whether the CRE could have erred tactically in organising its campaign. And a third is whether Labour's staunch response - from Robin Cook's 'chicken tikka massala' theory of the benefits of multiculturalism to the streetfighting Minister Ian McCartney - is entirely without risk. When the nation's billboards were suddenly stripped of a Tory poster depicting a young black man and his son under the slogan 'You've paid the taxes so where are all the teachers?' - to be replaced by a poster starring a white-looking man - Millbank apparatchiks scented blood. Surely, they thought, the poster was dumped because the Tories were afraid to use blacks. This was the line Labour spin doctors suggested to journalists. But there was only one problem: they were wrong. The poster was actually pulped after complaints by the man's ex-wife about the use of their son: and the new model was actually of non-British origin. It seems that playing the anti-racist card can also backfire. Robin Cook has genuinely strong per sonal feelings about racism. So in the political limbo caused by the delayed election, one idea dusted off to keep the restless Foreign Secretary busy was a speech on multiculturalism. His aide David Clark had spotted before Christmas a survey saying that chicken tikka massala was now the nation's favourite dish, For Clark, the idea of the Indian tikka mixed with an inauthentic massala sauce to satisfy Britons' love of gravy was a useful metaphor. But then, on the eve of the speech, newspapers began reporting Townend's refusal to sign the CRE compact. Clark was hastily summoned to add more lines recalling Ancram's warning to Tories not to overstep the mark. 'Coming to terms with multiculturalism as a positive force for our economy and society will have significant implications for our understanding of Britishness,' Cook concluded. It was misreading history to believe otherwise. The Daily Mail howled its outrage at his suggestion that there was no such thing as a 'British' race, in a story that helped convince Conservative Central Office that its cause against the CRE might not be so unpopular. But as far as Labour was concerned, it had worked. The rest of the press gobbled up the curry metaphor, and when Cook arrived for a lunch at the Mirror newspaper's east London offices on Thursday, he was offered a plate of chicken tikka massala. 'The Tories have a real problem with race,' said one leading Labour campaign manager. 'They twist one way and the other, trying to satisfy the superficial need to appear non-racist while stoking up their core support. It is a good issue for us.' Party officials, however, will bear in mind the Metropolitan Police's findings, revealed today by The Observer, that provocative speeches on immigration can trigger hate crime. Critics will say that the Government's own record on asylum issues and race is far from impressive. Just two of the 12 new ethnic minority candidates standing in the forthcoming election will do so in a winnable seat. 'We might be paying lip service to the issue but in fact we are going backwards,' said Diane Abbott, the black Labour MP and veteran campaigner. 'If you look at the 1980s there were more black and Asian Labour candidates and more black and Asian Labour councillors.' It is all a far cry from the autumn of 1997, when Tony Blair - still basking in the warmth of victory - told the Labour party conference in Brighton that he wanted to be a beacon of meritocracy to the world. 'Not one black High Court judge, not one black Chief Constable or Permanent Secretary, not one black army officer above the rank of Colonel. Not one Asian either,' he said. 'Not a record of pride for the British establishment. And not a record of pride for Parliament that there are so few black and Asian MPs.' Little has changed since then, in Westminster at least, and there are calls on the ground for less fine talk and more action. The number of ethnic minority MPs will probably only rise by one in June. The Foreign Office still boasts no black ambassadors. Abbott points out that Labour's Millbank HQ itself boasts 'rows and rows of young white people and very few black and Asian faces'. A letter dropped onto William Hague's desk a week after the signing of the CRE compact on 14 March. The CRE 'did not intend to police the signing of the compact by individual MPs or candidates', it said, but it wanted to know which ones supported the pledge. Could Hague encourage his MPs to sign? Hague's response was noncommittal, enclosing a copy of party chairman Ancram's letter to all candidates reminding them to watch their language and warning that candidates 'may also be invited to sign the compact in their own constituencies'. Hague's closest aides are adamant that they had an understanding from the CRE that individual MPs would not be singled out for refusing to sign the compact. Although it had been used in 1997, it was just the party leaders who had signed up then. Expecting all MPs to adhere to the document had been seen as too officious. 'We were taken aback to find the names of MPs who have refused to sign appearing in newspapers,' said one senior source last week. 'That was not the terms of the agreement.' The CRE only gave a few hours' notice on Thursday that it was posting results on its website. But the organisation - backed by the Liberal Democrats - is adamant that it was obvious from the start that the signatures would be publicised. 'We had never said this was going to be a closed process,' said a spokesman. 'If people asked for the figures, were we really going to say, no, it's confidential? That would have been ridiculous.' Either way, the row looks unlikely to go away.
