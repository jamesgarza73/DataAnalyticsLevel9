The sports minister, Ngconde Balfour, announced a judicial inquiry into the tragedy after saying earlier that inadequate preparations by the match organisers were to blame. \"Those South Africans who died there would not have died if proper arrangements had been put in place,\" he said. The disaster, during a match between South Africa's two fiercest soccer rivals, Kaiser Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, the premier soccer league leaders, has been attributed in part to the decision to sell tickets in advance as a means of avoiding last-minute crowds. But a series of other factors, from the timing of the match to a decision not to show it live on television, also contributed. It has also emerged that a former league chief had warned it would be \"suicidal\" to play a major football match at night at the Ellis Park stadium, because the facility could not handle the crowds. Three boys, aged 11, 13 and 17, were among the first 13 of the dead to be named. The identities of 30 others have yet to be made public. About 160 people were injured.

You get the feeling that if there were crowns they'd probably have fruit gums stuck in them for jewels. </p> <p>This is the studied naivety of the Birmingham Rep's joyously inventive retelling of the legend of Prince Rama and his wife Sita, who is stolen away by the evil demon Ravana. It feels like a school play, albeit one done unbelievably well. </p> <p>It demands that you join in the fun, embrace its tackiness. One of the musicians welcomes the audience and tries to get a bit of audience participation going. \"This is not a panto,\" he declares - but in fact the evening is very like one. There are demons dressed in long red satin with gold lam\u00e9 gloves, and Charlotte Bicknell as an evil temptress with a Madonna-style conical bra. The apes, which help Rama and his brother defeat Ravena and save Sita, monkey about to good clownish effect. </p> <p>How much you enjoy it will depend on your taste for this kind of self-conscious playfulness.

You get the feeling that if there were crowns they'd probably have fruit gums stuck in them for jewels. This is the studied naivety of the Birmingham Rep's joyously inventive retelling of the legend of Prince Rama and his wife Sita, who is stolen away by the evil demon Ravana. It feels like a school play, albeit one done unbelievably well. It demands that you join in the fun, embrace its tackiness. One of the musicians welcomes the audience and tries to get a bit of audience participation going. \"This is not a panto,\" he declares - but in fact the evening is very like one. There are demons dressed in long red satin with gold lam\u00e9 gloves, and Charlotte Bicknell as an evil temptress with a Madonna-style conical bra. The apes, which help Rama and his brother defeat Ravena and save Sita, monkey about to good clownish effect. How much you enjoy it will depend on your taste for this kind of self-conscious playfulness. Take the ocean: the cast doesn't quite wave bits of aquamarine material up and down to represent the sea - instead they do a variation with blue pompoms that my teacher companion fully intends to steal for her next school assembly.

Wisely, he retains the essential structure of these songs, adding the manic percussion of his Brazilian solo period and, for the closing half of his allotted 60 minutes, a flamboyant string section. </p> <p>He saves a cheeky surprise for the encore, covering Whitney Houston's I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) with straight-faced gusto.

The opening minutes of any performance will usually tell us what kind of spin dancers are going to put on them. Will we hate the caddish count on sight? Will we want to slap Giselle out of her trusting, virginal trance? These lovers were antique back in 1841 when arch-Romantic Theophile Gaultier wrote them into the ballet canon, and 21st-century dancers can find it hard to make sympathetic sense of them. </p> <p>On Wednesday night, however, Tamara Rojo and Johan Kobborg did much more than make sense of the tale. Without compromising a second of the ballet's fragile logic, they gave dramatic life to every beat of the performance. They did that special thing of losing themselves in ballet history while remaining passionately present in every gesture. </p> <p>Kobborg's Albrecht is a man besotted with love - so juiced up with adoration and fantasy that he barely registers anyone other than Giselle on stage. He has wandered miles out of his aristocratic routine into a place of his own imagining, yet what stops him looking mawkish is the transparent beauty of his dancing. Kobborg's Danish training has honed in him an extraordinarily clean line and ardent jump. We believe in Albrecht because the facts of his dancing are simultaneously so honest and so seductive. That he is also a partner of musical elegance and selfless accuracy clinches his power. We are entranced by him, so of course Giselle has to be. </p> <p>Rojo portrays her own character as a girl so painfully shy she can barely meet her lover's gaze. But she also plays literally and symbolically with Giselle's love of dancing - showing how eagerly she sheds her inhibitions as soon as she can move. In some performances Giselle's constant needling to show off her steps can make her seem like a spoilt child. With Rojo it carries the urgency of someone who can't express herself any other way. Again, what makes this work is the quality of Rojo's technique and her ability to make space within a single phrase for changes in emotional dynamic. When dancers reach this level they can make absolute sense of ballet's superficial limitations, charging up its simple plotlines with a subtext of visceral and musical feeling. </p> <p>Rojo's second act didn't quite match her first, its ghostly transparency not quite in her range, though I loved the way she retained spectral threads of her character even beyond the grave. Wednesday's supporting cast was mixed, but the lovers were wonderfully complemented by Christopher Saunders's dark and complicated Hilarion and William Tuckett's bluff and cynical Duke. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep until May 16.

With the ball entering the Samoans' net roughly every three minutes, the scoreboard operator at Coffs Harbour is believed to have flashed up one extra goal by mistake in the dying minutes. </p> <p>Some observers thought the Socceroos had won 32-0, with Thompson striking 14 goals. But in view of the scoreboard error, Fifa announced last night that it \"will only confirm the final official score when the various reports from the referee and the match commissioner have been received and checked\". </p> <p>American Samoa, representing a United States territory of five volcanic islands and 65,000 people in the South Pacific, boast only one international win in their history and are officially the world's worst team, ranked 203rd by Fifa. </p> <p>Their World Cup Oceania group campaign was doomed from the start when Fifa ruled that their players must have US passports. The only member of their first-team squad cleared was the goalkeeper Nicky Salapu, who has now conceded 52 goals in their past three qualifying matches. </p> <p>A 16-strong squad of US passport holders was scraped together, including two 15-year-olds and with an average age of 19. Their coach Tunoa Lui revealed his team of evangelical Christians prayed for divine intervention before this week's qualifiers at Coffs Harbour, 350 miles north of Sydney. </p> <p>\"We are here to learn. We have had a lot of problems but we don't give up,\" he said before yesterday's defeat. \"We are asking the Lord to help keep the score down.\" </p> <p>Although they had lost 13-0 to Fiji and 8-0 to Samoa here, their youngsters had until yesterday avoided a repeat of their previous record defeat, 18-0 away to Tahiti last June. </p> <p>At 29-0 down to Australia by the 86th minute, they rallied briefly when Pati Feagiai shot weakly at Australia's goalkeeper Michael Petkovic. </p> <p>Australia were 16-0 up at half-time, despite not calling up up stars like Mark Viduka and Harry Kewell of Leeds, and resting Coventry's John Aloisi after his six goals against Tonga. </p> <p>Thompson's goals - whether 13 or 14 - saw him surpass Denmark's Sofus Nielsen and Germany's Gottfried Fuchs, who had each scored 10 in a game, Nielsen in the 1908 Olympics against France and Fuchs against Russia at the 1912 games. </p> <p>The Marconi Stallions striker knocked down his achievement. \"Breaking the world record is a dream come true,\" said Thompson, \"but you have to look at the teams we're playing and ask questions.

      "bodyText": "Take the worst football team in the world, ban 19 of their squad for having the wrong passports, stop under-20s from deputising because of school exams and watch the records tumble. Australia's 31-0 defeat of American Samoa yesterday smashed their own world record for the most goals in an international, set only 48 hours earlier by the Socceroos in thumping Tonga 22-0. Yesterday Archie Thompson, 22, a New Zealander with a Papua New Guinean mother, scored 13 goals for Australia - another world record. Yet both Australia's and Thompson's tallies yesterday may be even greater. With the ball entering the Samoans' net roughly every three minutes, the scoreboard operator at Coffs Harbour is believed to have flashed up one extra goal by mistake in the dying minutes. Some observers thought the Socceroos had won 32-0, with Thompson striking 14 goals. But in view of the scoreboard error, Fifa announced last night that it \"will only confirm the final official score when the various reports from the referee and the match commissioner have been received and checked\". American Samoa, representing a United States territory of five volcanic islands and 65,000 people in the South Pacific, boast only one international win in their history and are officially the world's worst team, ranked 203rd by Fifa. Their World Cup Oceania group campaign was doomed from the start when Fifa ruled that their players must have US passports. The only member of their first-team squad cleared was the goalkeeper Nicky Salapu, who has now conceded 52 goals in their past three qualifying matches. A 16-strong squad of US passport holders was scraped together, including two 15-year-olds and with an average age of 19. Their coach Tunoa Lui revealed his team of evangelical Christians prayed for divine intervention before this week's qualifiers at Coffs Harbour, 350 miles north of Sydney. \"We are here to learn. We have had a lot of problems but we don't give up,\" he said before yesterday's defeat. \"We are asking the Lord to help keep the score down.\" Although they had lost 13-0 to Fiji and 8-0 to Samoa here, their youngsters had until yesterday avoided a repeat of their previous record defeat, 18-0 away to Tahiti last June. At 29-0 down to Australia by the 86th minute, they rallied briefly when Pati Feagiai shot weakly at Australia's goalkeeper Michael Petkovic. Australia were 16-0 up at half-time, despite not calling up up stars like Mark Viduka and Harry Kewell of Leeds, and resting Coventry's John Aloisi after his six goals against Tonga. Thompson's goals - whether 13 or 14 - saw him surpass Denmark's Sofus Nielsen and Germany's Gottfried Fuchs, who had each scored 10 in a game, Nielsen in the 1908 Olympics against France and Fuchs against Russia at the 1912 games. The Marconi Stallions striker knocked down his achievement. \"Breaking the world record is a dream come true,\" said Thompson, \"but you have to look at the teams we're playing and ask questions. We don't need to play these games. It's really a waste of time. \"Their players were laughing at the end. There wasn't much more they could do. I think their one attack consisted of getting over the halfway line.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

This is a two-hour ferry ride from downtown Auckland but takes you to one of the most remote, laid back, and beautiful parts of coast and forest in NZ. </p> <p>The Barrier has awesome bush and beaches, is rugged in the north, but more sheltered in the south. It is kind of a mini NZ, with all kinds of coast from rugged, fjord-like harbours in the north to sheltered bays in the south and wide open surf on the east coast. Don't expect it to be bustling, though - only a few thousand people live out there and there are only a few kilometres of sealed road on the island. The locals are friendly, though, and there are a couple of pubs on the beaches. It is made special by the lack of possums and deer which means that the forest is in the condition that the rest of the NZ bush once was, but unfortunately isn't quite anymore. I would recommend staying at <a href=\"http://www.straypossum.co.nz\">Stray Possum Backpackers</a> in Trypehna. They have a bus to provide transport round and you lend you sports gear, snorkeling gear and all that.</p> <p>Whatever you do, I hope you have a good time in NZ. It's an awesome country.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hey Milly, If you get the chance in NZ, spend a couple of days (at-least) at Tryphena on Great Barrier Island. This is a two-hour ferry ride from downtown Auckland but takes you to one of the most remote, laid back, and beautiful parts of coast and forest in NZ. The Barrier has awesome bush and beaches, is rugged in the north, but more sheltered in the south. It is kind of a mini NZ, with all kinds of coast from rugged, fjord-like harbours in the north to sheltered bays in the south and wide open surf on the east coast. Don't expect it to be bustling, though - only a few thousand people live out there and there are only a few kilometres of sealed road on the island. The locals are friendly, though, and there are a couple of pubs on the beaches. It is made special by the lack of possums and deer which means that the forest is in the condition that the rest of the NZ bush once was, but unfortunately isn't quite anymore. I would recommend staying at Stray Possum Backpackers in Trypehna. They have a bus to provide transport round and you lend you sports gear, snorkeling gear and all that. Whatever you do, I hope you have a good time in NZ. It's an awesome country.",

      "body": "<p>This week began like the opening of Four Weddings and a Funeral: we were woken by our door being hammered and someone yelling that our bus was ready to leave. Miraculously we made it out in 5 minutes. That morning we were driving west from Christchurch to Arthur's Pass at the foothills of the Southern Alps. The drive took us away from dry plains and into lush foliage - and it was here that it started bucketing down with rain. </p> <p>Arriving, we sprinted for the nearest hostel and grabbed our warmest clothes. The rain had set in for most of the day and though we attempted a short walk to a waterfall in the afternoon we came back absolutely soaked. We were very glad of the wood fire in the hostel lounge and settled in for the night with others from the hostel and a bottle of whisky. A small group of us did try to go to the sole bar - rumoured to stay open late - but at 8.30pm it was well and truly shut. Arthur's Pass village isn't a place you stay for the nightlife.</p> <p>The next morning we awoke to blue skies so decided not to leave until the afternoon, giving us time to enjoy a day's walk through the mountains. We chose Avalanche Peak track, seven hours return on paper - if you're extremely fit. The walk was lovely, taking us beside a waterfall and eventually up to breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains, but all the way long-forgotten muscles were crying at me. </p> <p>We took a bus the rest of the way to the west coast into Greymouth. Despite the winding, treacherous roads, we made it to our hostel safely. It was a Global Village backpackers - the same chain as my very first hostel in Canada, but why in Greymouth? It didn't take long to establish that this was a town that tried to draw in tourists simply as a convenient stopover before heading to more interesting places. Worked on us.</p> <p>That evening we actually cooked, on Josh's insistence (OK, he cooked, I stirred things). On Saturday we rose early to make use of the hostels kayaks and had a punt around the lake. It was a nice way to get some mornings exercise - although I'd better warn you the flies in this country will have you for dinner as soon as you expose flesh. Later, we were at least impressed by the town's liquor store where you could fill your own plastic bottles with beer, sherry or port. </p> <p>That night I had the largest meal in memory, at a restaurant called West of the Border which attracted us with its offer of free beer. I should have known it would be excessive when they produced an 11-page menu of Cowboy/Cowgirl's choice - including a 4.4lb steak. We both opted for baby back ribs, and between us probably gnawed our way through the three little pigs. </p> <p>The next morning we caught an early bus to Fox glacier, one of two glacial towns down the west coast we'd chosen for its good name. We went on a half-day ice-walk with a group and two guides. Wearing 15lb boots, which are great for the legs, we trekked in the sun through temperate rainforest onto the glacier itself. The clear blue sky meant we had stunning views across the glacier and up to the mountains. The ice beneath our feet shone blue beneath the surface - I compared it to walking on a blueberry squishie and got laughed at. The streams running from the glacier were so fresh and clean that we drank directly from them. The whole afternoon was captivating - but these glaciers are currently in retreat, so if you want to experience the joy of ice-walking go now while it's still possible. </p> <p>Next morning we were off again, bound for Queenstown in the South Island - probably the adrenaline capital of the world. I instantly fell in love with the town. It has all modern conveniences with shops and countless bars that open until late but still retains a charm and character with its lake and mountain setting. Every other shop seemed to be selling activities and tours - they really do want to keep you busy here. I was dying to try a few new things out, and one in particular?</p> <p>We decided to ease our way in to Queenstown life by going for an afternoon's jet-boating. Our driver took us spinning and swerving across Lake Wakatipu and down the Shotover river. Although he'd said we shouldn't get too wet I think I'd chosen a bad seating place in the boat - I got soaked every time! It was definitely a fun way to get a tour of the area. </p> <p>That evening Josh and I tried out the various bars of Queenstown, the town with the most thriving night-life I've seen yet in New Zealand. Happy hours abound: in one bar we had a Queenstown teapot - literally a teapot filled with dangerously tasty cocktail shots. That evening I was stood in a bar when two friends of mine from school walked past: it came as a shock to suddenly see them in a random bar in Queenstown, though I'd been told before I left I was bound to run into people I know.</p> <p>Wednesday was the day when I finally got to fulfil my burning ambition and go skydiving! A small van-load of us were driven to a landing site just outside Queenstown, where we had to fill a 'we accept no responsibility for your death' style form, and then just had to wait until we were called up. Two and a half hours of anxiously watching the wind get up and the skies get darker and praying not to have the flight cancelled, my name was called. </p> <p>In each plane-load there were 3 jumpers and the person we were tandemed with - I was with a Yugoslavian guy named Rob who was lovely and calming and told me if I gave him $500 he'd let me survive! We were put into jumpsuits and harnesses, taught the 'big banana' position (the way people curve backwards when they're skydiving) then we were off in the little plane, 12,000ft up into the air. </p> <p>Before I knew it the green light was on, the door was open, and the first girl was plummeting into the sky with alarming speed. Then it was our turn. Rob pushed me to the door and the force of the wind was incredible. He did a short countdown which didn't even give me time to consider what I was doing then we dropped. For a minute the mountains and lakes came hurtling towards me with a force so powerful I couldn't even scream. Then I realised I didn't want to - this was the most awesome and literally breathtaking feeling imaginable. </p> <p>After a while came the comforting but uncomfortable sensation of the parachute opening and we slowly twirled our way back to earth, objects on the ground changing from looking like toys to actually being solid and real. My hostel receptionist had warned me I'd be on a high for hours afterwards and he couldn't have been more right - I guess one reason people put themselves through these deadly activities is because you feel so incredibly alive afterwards. </p> <p>So my week ends on an unbelievable high. My only problem: now I've fulfilled my ambition, what should I do next?</p> <p>Until next week (I can't wait, I don't know about you)<br> Milly</p>",

Hawaii's four members of Congress and other officials welcomed the crew, along with local military families, after an overnight flight from Guam aboard a military transport jet. The crew faced 12 hour debriefing sessions to go over their ordeal, with an additional 14 hours on Friday. They will return to their home base and a warmer welcoming celebration in Washington state on Saturday. Their arrival in Hawaii came as the Bush administration began fresh diplomatic efforts to win back its crippled plane. The stalemate ended yesterday after Washington said it was \"very sorry\" for the incident - twice - but refused to give the outright apology that Beijing had earlier demanded. President George Bush said: \"We can't wait for them to get home.\" \"I'm very pleased they are back on American soil,\" the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, said earlier today, after he heard that the crew had reached a planned stopover at a US base in Guam. American and Chinese delegations were due to meet next Wednesday to weigh the future of the Navy aircraft. \"This is not over,\" Powell said amid meetings on the Balkans yesterday in Paris. \"Some discussions will begin, and we still have our plane there. But this will all unfold in the days and weeks ahead.\" Condoleezza Rice, the White House national security adviser, has emphasized that the incident will not end American surveillance flights near China, which she said are essential to the security of the US and its Asian allies. \"The responsibility for avoiding future accidents rests not just with the United States, it rests heavily with the Chinese and the way they respond to these flights,\" she said. The Chinese, who have not relented in their insistence that the US plane operated illegally, are also not relenting in their insistence that such flights be discontinued. But vice president Dick Cheney said the United States has a right to continue to operate aircraft in international airspace. \"That is not a subject we would want to concede on,\" he said in a radio interview. The dispute has given a boost to a bid to overturn last year's law paving the way for China to gain permanent normal trade relations with the US. The EP-3E, crammed with surveillance equipment, collided with a Chinese fighter jet on April 1 and made on emergency landing on Hainan island in southern China. Crew members worked to destroy top secret codes and intelligence before the Chinese came aboard. China agreed to release the crew after the US wrote a letter saying it was \"very sorry\" that the Chinese pilot was lost, and its plane had not received permission to make an emergency landing.

      "body": "<p><strong>HARD WORDS</strong> <br></p> <p>For a man who could probably get by with a simple system of grunts and barks, Roy Keane does give good copy. The Manchester United skipper has, in the recent past, made prawn sandwiches synonymous with being a ponce, told his teammates to pull their fingers out, and addressed the IMF on globalisation. We'll check on that last one, by the way, and get back to you. Anyway, Keane has continued with his recent garrulous form today and, amongst other things, claims he could be off to Celtic soon enough.</p> <p>\"In two years' time, if United say I can go, then Celtic is the club I would like to play for,\" he told the mighty MUTV (tonight at 9pm, Jonathan Greening stars as a lovelorn priest in a heart-rending remake of The Thorn Birds). Keane, who claims that some of his teammates \"are living off what happened two years ago\", says he doesn't plan to outstay his welcome at Old Trafford. \"At the end of this contract I will be 31 and maybe that will be time to say thank you for the memories because hopefully by then there will be new players coming through.\"</p> <p>But while Keane went on to list players like \"Figo\" and \"Rivaldo\" as desirable replacements, we're sure he meant popular-only-cos-you-can-sell -loads-of-replica-shirts-to-tourists midfielder Hideotoshi Nakata. Nakata, who has been rotting on Roma's bench for the best part of a season (honestly, you should see the state of his rib cage), is likely to leave the club this summer. So what a surprise to hear him nattering about United today. \"I know that I am loved by Manchester United and playing for them would be an ideal situation,\" he said. \"They are a great team and I know that I can help them.\" By doing a weekend shift in the Megastore?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE FIVER IS SHUT</strong> <br></p> <p>Before you say it, that's not a spelling mistake. Because of Easter and all that, you'll not hear a peep from us until Tuesday.

But, in a move which has turned the world's natural order upside down and given confused dermatologists in Greater Manchester hope, a player actually committed his future to Gregory today by signing a new four-year deal. The man in question is six-time England defender Gareth Barry, and the Fiver doffs its virtual cap to him, because he's either very brave or, well, you know.</p> <p>\"I'm delighted it has been sorted out,\" Gregory announced. \"I know Gareth still had two years left of his contract but I wanted to reward him for his achievements with us and bring him onto financial parity with other players,\" the Villa manager went on, gamely holding the show together in the total absence of the player himself. Nobody would say exactly where the lucky recipient of such an attractive new contract was; but perhaps he was in the lav, crying.</p> <p>\"He has crammed an awful lot into his career already and is the kind of player we want to try and build the future around,\" concluded Gregory of the 20-year-old he signed from Brighton for about six quid. Gregory then allowed himself to drift away in a dream of the bright future in store at Villa Park.

The stampede killed 43 people, 29 inside the stadium and 14 outside. Two of the dead were children. A further 89 people were injured, including nine who remain in critical condition. The disaster is South Africa's worst-ever sporting tragedy.</p> <p>Today, the South African football association promised a full investigation. In a statement former President Nelson Mandela said the inquiry should find ways to ensure there is never a repeat of the disaster. \"This incident should not divide us now but rather bring us even closer to ensure that this horror story does not repeat itself,\" he added. Meanwhile, football magazine editor Richard Maguire has blamed greed and poor organisation for the tragedy. \"The soccer authorities never ensure proper organisation\", he said. \"This has been waiting to happen for years. The rich people running these things wring their hands and protest innocence while people die cheaply because of their ineptitude.\"</p> <p>The South African Football Association (SAFA) has insisted that the disaster would not affect plans to bid for the World Cup finals in 2010. \"This was a tragic incident that is not good for the image of our soccer, but we will be able to learn and make sure the mistakes never happen again,\" said SAFA chief executive, Danny Jordaan.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A professor of drama at the Arizona State University has been denied tenure because of his insistence on teaching the works of William Shakespeare, and at least one student newspaper in Canada is not amused. The head of the department had maintained that Shakespeare was \"racist and sexist\" and therefore not appropriate content for university students, and subsequently vowed to \"kill off the classics\". The university has replaced Hamlet with \"Betty the Yeti: An Eco Fable\", in which a feminist environmentalist leaves her husband to go live \"in harmony with nature\" and begins a sexual affair with a sasquatch.</p> <p>A gruff editorial response published in <strong>The Varsity</strong>, a student newspaper at the University of Toronto, Canada, said that such \"assaults on the honour and integrity of higher education\" are part of the wider problem of diversity consciousness at universities, with its own institution being a prime example. \"The focus of academia these days, it seems, is not reason, not the pursuit of knowledge, not the preparation for a career but rather something called 'multiculturalism',\" the paper complained.</p> <p>The paper cited another recent case, at the University of Wisconsin, where an information brochure sent to prospective students featured a large photograph of students cheering on the school football team. The photo made sure to maintain an \"ethnic balance\" and featured an equal number of white, black, Asian and Hispanic students. The photo was a fake, doctored from an original in which all the cheering students had been white. The university had found this offensive and super-imposed photographs of minority students into the picture. \"Most people are quick to accept this new code and even applaud it,\" the article said. \"After all, this is about tolerance and equality, right? No, it's not. 'Ethnic diversity' is merely racism in a politically correct disguise.\"</p> <p>Well, sure. But at <strong>The Post</strong> student paper at Ohio University, there were bigger fish to fry this past week. An editorial weighed in on the issue of the proposed amendment before the US Congress that would prohibit the physical desecration of the American national flag. The initiative already has more than 100 co-sponsors in the country's House of Representatives and it needs \"to be struck down,\" the paper said. \"It would be a very hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedom by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves.\"</p> <p>At the University of Melbourne, in Australia, the student organ <strong>Farrago</strong> ran the colourful but possibly overstated headline, \"Why Melbourne University Is Fucked\". The article reported that the institution's vice-chancellor, Alan Gilbert, had been acting in \"an increasingly ditzy manner\" after a London newspaper revealed that the institution's sponsorship plans for a private university looked to be on very shaky financial ground. The paper also included news of a report tabled recently in the Australian parliament that examines the question of possible links between a $2m \"donation\" made recently to the university and the upgrading of an unidentified postgraduate student's marks.</p> <p>Singapore's <strong>Quo Vadis Aspire</strong>, the official voice of the student union at the National University of Singapore, appeared to be tempting fate this week by running what it billed as being an independently minded article on one of the city-state's few opposition MPs, Chiam See Tong, who recently visited the national university to address a lunchtime meeting of 400 students. \"I was never the type to attend any political rallies or worry too deeply about the political fate of Singapore,\" writer Kenneth Tan began. However, he added, a touch generously, \"while I disagreed with many issues Mr Chiam raised and was generally unimpressed with his sometimes lame answers in the Q&amp;A session, I managed to get something out of the lecture. I walked out with my thoughts provoked and though I most probably wouldn't stand in Hong Lim Square speaking for the Opposition, much less vote for them (at least not in the next elections), their alternative voice is one to be heard.\" So that's OK then. (A title of another unintentionally humorous article published in the same edition of the publication read, \"Cell-phones - Friend Or Foe?\")</p> <p>And this just in at <strong>The Heights</strong>, the student newspaper at Boston College, \"I've been itching to get this out for a while,\" wrote Annie Barrat, in an editorial page commentary on current affairs. \"Mayonnaise is wonderful. It tastes great. It's a major asset to any sandwich, or to fries, if you're going for that pseudo-European or 'Matthew Perry in The Whole Nine Yards' look... So go out there, grab some packets, and go nuts. You too can 'show them' and 'live on the edge\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "A professor of drama at the Arizona State University has been denied tenure because of his insistence on teaching the works of William Shakespeare, and at least one student newspaper in Canada is not amused. The head of the department had maintained that Shakespeare was \"racist and sexist\" and therefore not appropriate content for university students, and subsequently vowed to \"kill off the classics\". The university has replaced Hamlet with \"Betty the Yeti: An Eco Fable\", in which a feminist environmentalist leaves her husband to go live \"in harmony with nature\" and begins a sexual affair with a sasquatch. A gruff editorial response published in The Varsity, a student newspaper at the University of Toronto, Canada, said that such \"assaults on the honour and integrity of higher education\" are part of the wider problem of diversity consciousness at universities, with its own institution being a prime example. \"The focus of academia these days, it seems, is not reason, not the pursuit of knowledge, not the preparation for a career but rather something called 'multiculturalism',\" the paper complained. The paper cited another recent case, at the University of Wisconsin, where an information brochure sent to prospective students featured a large photograph of students cheering on the school football team. The photo made sure to maintain an \"ethnic balance\" and featured an equal number of white, black, Asian and Hispanic students. The photo was a fake, doctored from an original in which all the cheering students had been white. The university had found this offensive and super-imposed photographs of minority students into the picture. \"Most people are quick to accept this new code and even applaud it,\" the article said. \"After all, this is about tolerance and equality, right? No, it's not. 'Ethnic diversity' is merely racism in a politically correct disguise.\" Well, sure. But at The Post student paper at Ohio University, there were bigger fish to fry this past week. An editorial weighed in on the issue of the proposed amendment before the US Congress that would prohibit the physical desecration of the American national flag. The initiative already has more than 100 co-sponsors in the country's House of Representatives and it needs \"to be struck down,\" the paper said. \"It would be a very hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedom by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves.\" At the University of Melbourne, in Australia, the student organ Farrago ran the colourful but possibly overstated headline, \"Why Melbourne University Is Fucked\". The article reported that the institution's vice-chancellor, Alan Gilbert, had been acting in \"an increasingly ditzy manner\" after a London newspaper revealed that the institution's sponsorship plans for a private university looked to be on very shaky financial ground. The paper also included news of a report tabled recently in the Australian parliament that examines the question of possible links between a $2m \"donation\" made recently to the university and the upgrading of an unidentified postgraduate student's marks. Singapore's Quo Vadis Aspire, the official voice of the student union at the National University of Singapore, appeared to be tempting fate this week by running what it billed as being an independently minded article on one of the city-state's few opposition MPs, Chiam See Tong, who recently visited the national university to address a lunchtime meeting of 400 students. \"I was never the type to attend any political rallies or worry too deeply about the political fate of Singapore,\" writer Kenneth Tan began. However, he added, a touch generously, \"while I disagreed with many issues Mr Chiam raised and was generally unimpressed with his sometimes lame answers in the Q&amp;A session, I managed to get something out of the lecture. I walked out with my thoughts provoked and though I most probably wouldn't stand in Hong Lim Square speaking for the Opposition, much less vote for them (at least not in the next elections), their alternative voice is one to be heard.\" So that's OK then. (A title of another unintentionally humorous article published in the same edition of the publication read, \"Cell-phones - Friend Or Foe?\") And this just in at The Heights, the student newspaper at Boston College, \"I've been itching to get this out for a while,\" wrote Annie Barrat, in an editorial page commentary on current affairs. \"Mayonnaise is wonderful. It tastes great. It's a major asset to any sandwich, or to fries, if you're going for that pseudo-European or 'Matthew Perry in The Whole Nine Yards' look... So go out there, grab some packets, and go nuts. You too can 'show them' and 'live on the edge\".",

      "body": "<p>For some people, maps are an obsession. They may be drawn in by the bright colours, or the vicarious sense of adventure, or the impression of order that maps impose on the world. Whatever it is, Ian Thomas is one of those people. He is fanatical. Thomas makes maps for a living and stays up until midnight making them in his spare time. He has a gift for it, no doubt inherited from his father, who analysed aerial photographs for the RAF nearly half a century ago, scrutinising Egyptian troop movements during the Suez conflict. </p> <p>Now the son, Watford-born but a naturalised American, stares at the world through a computer screen, summoning up a satellite image of just about any corner of the globe he chooses. With a few more clicks and a bit of web browsing he can conjure up some relevant data, put it together with the image and make a picture that tells you something about the world. By his own estimate he has done this 20,000 times or more in his short career as a hi-tech cartographer. </p> <p>It is a skill that has earned him a living and a good deal of respect from his colleagues at the US Geological Survey (USGS). But it has also taken him on to a particularly nasty political battlefield, and he has consequently been sacked and become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre - mapmaking's first modern martyr. All this because of a single map the size of a postcard. He put it together on the evening of March 7 with some data he had collected about the calving habits of caribou - North America's oversize version of reindeer - in a remote corner of Alaska for a project that had failed to win funding. </p> <p>It turned out that his map was far too clear for his own good. It charted, for all to see, where the Bush administration was going with its environmental policies - and the price it was willing to pay to get there. The map depicted, in brilliant red, the area of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge where caribou most often go in spring to have their calves. It was a narrow strip along the state's northern coast, adjacent to the Canadian border. It was also known as Area 1002, and it was precisely the strip of land that the new US government was proposing to open up for exploration and exploitation by the oil companies that had backed George Bush's election campaign. </p> <p>Thomas now swears that when he put the map on the internet he had no idea where the administration wanted to drill for oil. Sitting in a Washington pub, looking back on the extraordinary chain of events of the past two weeks, he says: \"If they had just told me, I would have taken it down. I didn't want to cause any trouble. I loved my job.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, it was too late for Thomas, whose timing could not have been worse. His map appeared on the internet just as the new secretary of the interior, Gale Norton, was being briefed on the Arctic refuge's ecology. Norton's job is to champion the cause of Arctic drilling. On the evidence of its environmental policies to date, this administration is not merely pro-business; it actually appears to hold a grudge against the natural world. It has rejected the Kyoto treaty on global warming, ruled out statutory limits on industrial carbon dioxide emissions, dropped a ban on building roads through indigenous forests, closed down wildlife research centres and even lifted federal limits on the permissible level of arsenic that mining companies are allowed to leave in the water table. </p> <p>Throughout, it has maintained the same Orwellian tone of reassurance. The soothing message on the Arctic wildlife refuge was that oil prospecting would only affect one small part of it and that the animals would hardly notice the derricks. </p> <p>Thomas's map showed that the supposedly small area under consideration was critical to the refuge's wildlife. All the experts briefing Norton knew this, but the map made the point in public, and its appearance triggered alarm bells at the higher reaches of USGS management, which was already worried about its future funding. The word went out that the people at the top were demanding the head of the mapmaker responsible. </p> <p>When Thomas came to work the following Monday, there was a note on his door ordering him to see his supervisor. He had failed to see a warning from a colleague in Alaska telling him to take his map off the web. Two weeks on, the sense of shock remains. </p> <p>\"I'd never been in trouble before,\" he says. \"No one had complained before about any of my maps. They way overreacted.\" </p> <p>Thomas asked for the right to provide a written explanation and defence of his actions, but his employers refused to accept it. Thomas decided he would write it anyway, for his own satisfaction. So he stayed behind that night clearing his desk and working on his letter. </p> <p>\"I stayed to 5am on Tuesday morning, and I thought, 'I'll just send out the letter on the internet, just to explain what had happened.' By 5.15 am, I got my first email letter back. It was from someone in South Korea, saying, 'This is terrible and I'm going to send it to everyone I know.' And I thought, 'Oh shit.' \" </p> <p>Thus a green icon was born. The tale of Thomas's martyrdom spread around the world via internet chatrooms in a matter of hours, and he received 2,000 emails of support. His cause was taken up by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, Defenders of Wildlife and a host of other pressure groups. By his own admission, the mapmaker is an unlikely and an entirely accidental hero. Thomas would probably not even have come to the US had he not been in the University of London student union bar to see a band called The Telescopes one night in 1991. </p> <p>He fell in love with an American girl doing temporary work for the union, and followed her back to the US the same year when he finished his engineering degree. By chance, the National Audubon Society, a private conservation group, was looking for someone with a knowledge of hydrology for a research project on Nebraska's Platte River, a route taken by many migratory birds. </p> <p>That triggered his interest in wildlife, which in turn got him a job at the Nature Conservancy (the US version of the National Trust), where he learned to make maps. In 1998 he ended up at the USGS, where he found his niche at the migratory birds department at Patuxent, a set in 20 square miles of protected Maryland wetlands. </p> <p>Since his dismissal, the interior department has portrayed Thomas as an ideological maverick operating beyond the control of his supervisors. \"Mr Thomas was not doing the work he was paid to do and was instead doing what he chose to do,\" said Trudy Harlow, a USGS spokeswoman now working for Gale Norton. \"He was counselled repeatedly to stick to what he was meant to be doing...This caribou map was just the straw that broke the camel's back.\"</p> <p>Furthermore, Harlow said, the map was plain wrong, a gross simplification of out-of-date information. For that reason, his contract was terminated by local management, without any interference from above. </p> <p>Throughout his three years at Patuxent, Thomas's skills were highly regarded. He was encouraged to put together maps for all departments. He was even given an USGS award for his far-reaching work. \"I used my contract money to get him to do things for me on the things I was doing,\" says Sam Droege, a researcher on amphibians at Patuxent. \"We are all of us working outside our job descriptions in our general mandate of promoting conservation. Ian was very highly regarded. He was a person who could do all sorts of novel and interesting things and he was really good at finding information.\" </p> <p>It looks as if the order to get rid of Thomas came from outside Patuxent. The warning email he had failed to read the weekend before his dismissal came from a colleague who had taken part in the Alaska meeting with Norton. He said the reaction \"would not have been so great had the subject matter not been one of the three USDOI (department of interior) super hot topics with the new administration and had we not been briefing the Secretary at the nearly exact time your website went up\". </p> <p>The charge which does stick, however, is that the map was inaccurate. It was based largely on 1999 data, but as Thomas points out, that was the latest information publicly available. Meanwhile, Brad Griffith, a caribou researcher on whose work the map was based, is annoyed that Thomas did not consult him and says the bright red \"hot spot\" area for caribou calving should really be much bigger. Thomas pleads guilty. \"If only I had managed to find Griffith, I could have put it right,\" he says. \"My map is actually good for the oil companies. That's the irony.\" </p> <p>In last month's briefing on the wildlife refuge, Norton was told that caribou tend to stay at least 4km from any human infrastructure. According to briefing papers obtained by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and made available to the Guardian, the interior secretary was also informed that: \"When naturally restricted from the coastal plain, calf survival averages about 14% lower than when calving occurs primarily on the coastal plain.\" </p> <p>For that reason, \"while the 1002 Area is only 8% of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it is an important component of the biological integrity for the entire refuge\". </p> <p>Despite this unambiguous warning, Norton told an appreciative audience of oil executives last week that she had returned from the Arctic refuge more convinced than ever that drilling could proceed with minimal impact. </p> <p>The future of the refuge still hangs in the balance. There is little support in Congress for drilling, and Bush recently signalled he might be flexible on the issue. However, his powerful vice president, Dick Cheney, remains hawkish, as does Norton. An energy task force is expected to back Arctic drilling in the next few weeks. </p> <p>Thomas, meanwhile, has found another job - making maps for the World Wildlife Fund, where he continues to pore over satellite images of the world's rapidly diminishing wildlife habitats. Shrinking even faster is the amount of publicly available information about the Arctic and other US national reserves - the sort of information Thomas used to post on the internet for free. A map of probable drilling installations in Area 1002 vanished a few days ago. The Fisheries and Wildlife Services,anxious not to offend, has also stripped its website of pages dealing with the potential environmental impact of mineral extraction. </p> <p>\"You don't have to burn books now,\" says Thomas. \"You just press the delete key.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by Plathel Benjamin.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Johannes Brahms, bewhiskered composer of four symphonies, has been cleared of one of the most serious charges ever levelled at a musical genius - the accusation that he was a serial cat slayer.</p> <p>For more than a century, cat lovers have accepted as true the allegation that Brahms slaughtered felines, transcribed the sounds of their dying moments and callously incorporated them in to his works.</p> <p>But research proves that the foul calumny was almost certainly the work of Richard Wagner, a notoriously bitchy composer whose operas go on longer than one of the nine lives of an average mog.</p> <p>Writing in the May issue of the BBC Music Magazine, Calum MacDonald, who is the author of a study of Brahms, dismisses the charge on empirical grounds. \"In my own limited but miserable experience, dying cats don't tend to make much noise,\" he says.</p> <p>In his review of the evidence, he notes that stories of Brahms killing cats surface mainly in books about cats rather than in books about music \"which is suspicious in itself\".</p> <p>He finds one of the most recent accounts in Desmond Morris's Cat World, published in 1996, which claims that Brahms began cat bagging after the Czech composer Antonin Dvorak gave him a \"Bohemian sparrow slaying bow\".</p> <p>Brahms used to take aim from his apartment window in Vienna, alleges Morris, who then quotes Wagner: \"After spearing the poor brutes, he reeled them in to his room after the manner of a trout-fisher. Then he eagerly listened to the expiring groans of his victims and carefully jotted down in his notebook their ante mortem remarks.\"</p> <p>Morris adds: \"According to Wagner, who disliked Brahms, he worked these sounds into his chamber music.\"</p> <p>MacDonald dismisses every detail of this account as suspect and reports that Morris cannot now find the source for Wagner's comments. He also explains that Wagner never visited Brahms's flat, so at best could only have been retailing gossip. Dvorak and Brahms met in 1880, only three years before Wagner died, leaving a very limited time for Brahms to become an expert with the Bohemian bow and for Wagner to get wind of the story, had it been true.</p> <p>MacDonald adds: \"Dvorak would presumably have to have given Brahms the bow in person but their collected correspondence contains no letter saying, 'Please, Honoured Master, accept this amusing artefact from my native land'.\"</p> <p>He then asks: \"Is there really such a thing as a 'Bohemian sparrow slaying bow'?</p> <p>\"Brahms's 'apartment' is presumably his flat in the Karlgasse, which was several floors up, so he'd need a long line to haul up any speared moggies. Did sparrow slaying bows have lines attached? It surely wouldn't be strong enough to haul in dying cats, especially if they were struggling.\"</p> <p>After consulting Styra Avins, editor of Johannes Brahms: Life and Letters, MacDonald learned that in 1893 - when Brahms was still alive - a music critic for the New York Times, James Huneker, had cited the story of the composer's hatred of cats as an example of how biography could be contaminated by deliberate fiction. Huneker named Wagner as the guilty man.</p> <p>\"Brahms's supposed sadism is a malicious fabrication,\" MacDonald concludes. Which means the rest of us can listen to the clarinet quintet without fearing that some of its finest moments were inspired by a cat yowling its way to oblivion.</p> <p><b>Catty genius</b></p> <p><b> Richard Wagner (1818-1883)</b></p> <p>The dramatic radical who took music into new realms of tonality and, with a godlike certainty of his genius, demanded universal applause. He built his own theatre in Bayreuth, Germany, in which to stage the music dramas on which his fame rests.</p> <p>He proved irresistible to women, including Cosima, daughter of Franz Liszt and wife of the conductor Hans von Bulow, who apparently did not mind losing his partner to an intellectual superior.</p> <p>Wagner wrote: \"I am being used as the instrument for something higher than my own being warrants.

      "bodyText": "Johannes Brahms, bewhiskered composer of four symphonies, has been cleared of one of the most serious charges ever levelled at a musical genius - the accusation that he was a serial cat slayer. For more than a century, cat lovers have accepted as true the allegation that Brahms slaughtered felines, transcribed the sounds of their dying moments and callously incorporated them in to his works. But research proves that the foul calumny was almost certainly the work of Richard Wagner, a notoriously bitchy composer whose operas go on longer than one of the nine lives of an average mog. Writing in the May issue of the BBC Music Magazine, Calum MacDonald, who is the author of a study of Brahms, dismisses the charge on empirical grounds. \"In my own limited but miserable experience, dying cats don't tend to make much noise,\" he says. In his review of the evidence, he notes that stories of Brahms killing cats surface mainly in books about cats rather than in books about music \"which is suspicious in itself\". He finds one of the most recent accounts in Desmond Morris's Cat World, published in 1996, which claims that Brahms began cat bagging after the Czech composer Antonin Dvorak gave him a \"Bohemian sparrow slaying bow\". Brahms used to take aim from his apartment window in Vienna, alleges Morris, who then quotes Wagner: \"After spearing the poor brutes, he reeled them in to his room after the manner of a trout-fisher. Then he eagerly listened to the expiring groans of his victims and carefully jotted down in his notebook their ante mortem remarks.\" Morris adds: \"According to Wagner, who disliked Brahms, he worked these sounds into his chamber music.\" MacDonald dismisses every detail of this account as suspect and reports that Morris cannot now find the source for Wagner's comments. He also explains that Wagner never visited Brahms's flat, so at best could only have been retailing gossip. Dvorak and Brahms met in 1880, only three years before Wagner died, leaving a very limited time for Brahms to become an expert with the Bohemian bow and for Wagner to get wind of the story, had it been true. MacDonald adds: \"Dvorak would presumably have to have given Brahms the bow in person but their collected correspondence contains no letter saying, 'Please, Honoured Master, accept this amusing artefact from my native land'.\" He then asks: \"Is there really such a thing as a 'Bohemian sparrow slaying bow'? \"Brahms's 'apartment' is presumably his flat in the Karlgasse, which was several floors up, so he'd need a long line to haul up any speared moggies. Did sparrow slaying bows have lines attached? It surely wouldn't be strong enough to haul in dying cats, especially if they were struggling.\" After consulting Styra Avins, editor of Johannes Brahms: Life and Letters, MacDonald learned that in 1893 - when Brahms was still alive - a music critic for the New York Times, James Huneker, had cited the story of the composer's hatred of cats as an example of how biography could be contaminated by deliberate fiction. Huneker named Wagner as the guilty man. \"Brahms's supposed sadism is a malicious fabrication,\" MacDonald concludes. Which means the rest of us can listen to the clarinet quintet without fearing that some of its finest moments were inspired by a cat yowling its way to oblivion. Catty genius Richard Wagner (1818-1883) The dramatic radical who took music into new realms of tonality and, with a godlike certainty of his genius, demanded universal applause. He built his own theatre in Bayreuth, Germany, in which to stage the music dramas on which his fame rests. He proved irresistible to women, including Cosima, daughter of Franz Liszt and wife of the conductor Hans von Bulow, who apparently did not mind losing his partner to an intellectual superior. Wagner wrote: \"I am being used as the instrument for something higher than my own being warrants. I am in the hands of the immortal genius that I serve for the span of my life.\" Trying to find something to say to Brahms after hearing one of his works, he commented: \"The evil only starts when one attempts to compose better than one can.\" Maligned maestro Johannes Brahms (1833-1897) A romantic who idolised Beethoven and was so intimidated by his predecessor's genius that he waited until he was 43 to produce his own first symphony. He wrote three more, plus two concertos for piano, one for violin, one for violin and cello and a series of chamber works. Robert and Clara Schumann invited him to share their home. Brahms, who never had a lasting relationship with a woman, may have been in love with Clara. He supported her when Robert tried to kill himself. In later life, he was known for his rudeness.

      "bodyText": "The pain and inconvenience of regular injections could become a thing of the past after a team of scientists stumbled on a means of administering some drugs with an inhaler. Researchers at the universities of Strathclyde and Glasgow have found a way of making drug particles so small they can pass through the lung wall and into the blood. The technology, which could be available for public use within four years, could radically improve the quality of treatment for thousands of insulin-dependent diabetics who have to inject their medication. Until now, drugs based on natural proteins, such as insulin, have had to be given by injection, because if they were taken in tablet form they would be broken down by acids in the stomach. Researchers at the two universities have been working together on the project for the last two years after a team of chemists at Strathclyde stumbled across the process during an experiment on enzyme-based catalysts. The newly-patented technology has been developed to allow the manufacture of protein-coated microcrystals, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The particles are being tested using dry powder inhalers similar to those used by asthma sufferers. An artificial lung is being used to check that the particles are small enough to pass deep into the lung. The technology could also be used to treat many other diseases such as cystic fibrosis, osteoporosis, emphysema and multiple sclerosis. The project has received funding from Scottish Enterprise's Proof of Concept fund, which encourages technological innovations. Barry Moore, of Strathclyde University's department of pure and applied chemistry, said that the breakthrough was significant and could revolutionise the treatment of countless people. \"Essentially we have found a way of making very fine protein particles - so fine that they are able to get to the base of the lung,\" he said. \"To do that they need to be 100th of the width of a human hair.

The procedure targets a thumbnail-sized region of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, which produces a substance called acetylcholine, critical in modulating thought and memory. The San Diego team's approach is to take a sample of skin cells from the patient months before surgery and insert a gene in them which expresses a chemical called nerve growth factor (NGF). These cells are multiplied in culture, tested to see that they are producing the right amount of NGF, and then injected into the nucleus basalis with a fine needle put through a hole in the patient's skull.

      "body": "<p>6am : My body clock awakens me, as usual, a few minutes before my 20-month-old son opens his eyes. I am 52 years old and, unable to find work as a language teacher in the UK, in 1995 I completed a one-month CTEFL training course and set off for Russia. Here I not only found work, but also a wife. We now have two children. </p> <p>9am: I set off for work. The children have been changed and fed and our tiny, two-roomed \"Kryshchev\" flat has been put back in order.</p> <p>Moscow has an official population of about 10 million and an endemic shortage of accommodation. In the 60's, Nikita Kryshchev inaugurated a quick building programme of tiny flats which now bear his name and are slowly being replaced with more spacious accommodation. Living in a Kryshchev flat is like living in a small boat, where space is utilised to a maximum and everything has its place. Beds fold away and the walls are lined with cupboards and shelves.</p> <p>I live in central Moscow, about a mile and a half from the walls of the Kremlin. I always travel by Metro. The Moscow Metro is justifiably the best in the world, not only because of its architectural grandeur; one rarely has to wait more than three minutes for the arrival of a train. The downside, however, is that the trains are often packed to capacity on weekdays and it is often unbearably stuffy during the hot Moscow summer. When I first arrived in the city as a student in the dying days of the Soviet Union, everything used to shut down at 9pm. One could then stroll through the quiet streets, only rarely seeing any privately owned vehicles. Now the streets are packed with cars, mostly imported Mercs and BMWs that would make a British road-worthiness inspector's hair stand on end. Driving in Moscow is a nightmare. Traffic lights are universally ignored; and \"new Russians\" in their brand-new American or Japanese jeeps regularly mount the pavements to beat the inevitable snarl-ups, treating pedestrians with less respect than they would farmyard chickens. Travelling by Metro is the only way to avoid this insanity.</p> <p>9.40am: I arrive at the language school where for the past two years I have done most of my work. Since coming to Russia, I have worked as a freelance EFL teacher, having realised that I am clearly operating in a seller's market. I have taught in banks and schools, teaching adults and children, both in groups and individually. A native English speaker is worth his or her weight in gold here; academic qualifications are of secondary importance. </p> <p>Russian language schools are usually more than willing to hire teachers with little or no experience, which is a problem. Russia is one of the few countries in the world where EFL teachers are not required to have, as a minimum, an education to a first-degree standard or any teaching experience. There is therefore a surfeit of inexperienced teachers, most of whom arrive not knowing what to expect. Most of them belong to the \"anti-grammar\" school of teaching methodology, either because they have been trained to teach that way or because they themselves have scant knowledge of English grammar. \"Grammar translation\" is the main foreign language teaching method in Russian schools. Russian students, be they young or old, expect a teacher to explain the grammatical whys and wherefores of the English language, and if such explanations are not immediately forthcoming, then they consider their instruction to be of dubious quality. It is partly for this reason that there is a large turnover rate of EFL teachers in Russia. I have many times witnessed students refusing to be taught by people who, in their opinion, are not teachers. </p> <p>Personally, I tell my students that they will not learn to speak English by learning grammatical \"rules\". Nevertheless, I always keep in mind that I am selling them a product and if, for whatever reason, they question the quality of that product, I feel that I must modify it according to their demands. </p> <p>The other main cause of the large turnover rate of EFL teachers in Russia is simply that Russia is not an easy country to live in. Many teachers spend their time here counting the days remaining until the end of their contract. </p> <p>10am-12.15am: My first lesson: an adult group at upper-intermediate level. In Russia there are \"astronomical hours\" and \"academic hours\". The former are what are known worldwide as hours that last for 60 minutes and the latter are \"teaching hours\" that last for 45 minutes. </p> <p>The average rate of pay in Moscow EFL schools is now US$12 an hour. Most schools pay in dollars and roubles, usually on a 50/50 basis. However, if the management appreciates your value, you can receive all your pay in dollars. I earn around $2,500 a month and live well. A skilled manual worker is lucky to earn $50 a month. Food is cheap - for a Westerner - and plentiful, but imported luxury goods are expensive. British Home Stores recently closed its Moscow outlet, which was hardly surprising since their products were marked up by at least 50% on their UK selling price. You can buy Guinness in Irish bars here for about \u00a34.50 a pint, and you can buy a decent Russian beer for about 25p a pint.</p> <p>Few people pay tax in Russia. I think I do, but I do not really know. There is a PAYE system, but I receive cash in hand and ask no questions. I just simply presume that the two companies with whom I have contracts make tax contributions on my behalf. To date, the tax police have not visited me.</p> <p>I use the usual Oxford/Cambridge University Press course books provided by the schools. I do little lesson preparation, as I know these courses by heart. They are unsuitable for Russians, being either too eurocentric - the question, \"Ask your partner where you went on holiday last year\", gives rise to the almost universal response, \"To my grandparents* in the country\" - or downright boring. Therefore, over the years I have accumulated masses of my own material and often use the internet as a teaching source. I am also writing my own course book targeted at Russian speakers, which I hope to have published this year.</p> <p>1pm-2.30pm: Second lesson, teaching two Russian teachers of English. I use a conversational English course book and my own materials. Russian teachers have little idea of correct register, hardly ever use phrasal verbs, avoid modals and make horrendous errors when attempting to express conditional sentences. They also have a major pronunciation problem as they believe that \"correct\" English is the RP of 70 years ago and usually sound like an American actor taking off Noel Coward. </p> <p>3pm-4.30pm: Individual tuition, with a 14-year-old girl whose banker father wants her to study at Roedean. She has already studied for four years at a private school in Baden-Baden and her English is suffering a severe case of German grammar interference. I have negotiated a special rate for this work: $15 an hour. The banker is more than willing to pay this fee after having previously found out how much the British Council wanted for private tuition.</p> <p>4.30pm-6pm: A back-to-back lesson, which is not really good policy, but I have a wife and two babies to feed. One to one tuition of a schoolgirl again, but this time for only $10 an hour. The girl knows and understands the basic grammatical structure of English - although she believes that there is an English future tense and therefore overuses \"will\" - but she cannot speak English. In other words, she is suffering the classic symptoms of grammar-translation tuition. She is only too happy doing grammar exercises, but speak she will not. It is like getting water out of a stone trying to get her to talk and very tiring. The lesson drags on to its close.</p> <p>6pm-7pm: A welcome break. I can mark some homework and prepare the next lesson.</p> <p>7pm-9.15pm: Last lesson, with an advanced group of adults. Two of the group of eight have lived and worked in the USA and are already fluent English speakers. The others still have major problems: modals, conditionals, pronunciation, wrong tenses, wrong register and limited vocabulary. By the end of the lesson I am fighting to keep awake.</p> <p>I normally get home at around 10.15pm and get to bed at around 1am or even later.</p> <p>On my way home I buy a beer at a kiosk, where beggars immediately pester me for money. It can often be dangerous for a westerner to talk to strangers at night. The other day a colleague of mine was severely beaten by a gang of youths for no other reason than that he is a foreigner. </p> <p>Young Russians slavishly imitate western fashions. At night they watch uncensored American films and repeat and learn all the obscenities they can. Most Russians are fascinated by the west, but at the same time many of them are envious of westerners. This dislike of foreigners is especially noticeable among the uneducated, although many educated Russians also have this curious love-hate relationship. This, together with the cramped living conditions, can often make Moscow a frustrating and unfriendly city to live in.</p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The author of this piece wishes to write under a pseudonym</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair and John Prescott were today making further visits to countryside tourist attractions in an attempt to persuade Britons that foot and mouth should not stop them holidaying in the UK this Easter.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister visited the Grand Union Canal in Tring, Hertfordshire, to announce the reopening to walkers of 1,000 miles of towpaths - two thirds of the national total.</p> <p>The prime minister was set to make a trip to a seaside resort and country pub in Devon to drive home the point that, even in the areas worst hit by the disease, facilities were still open for visitors.</p> <p>Their efforts come amid predictions that some 1.75m Britons will flee foot and mouth and the forecasted showers by taking an Easter break abroad. Many tourism businesses are expecting trade to be significantly below normal over the Easter period - traditionally the first busy weekend of the holiday year. The British Hospitality Association yesterday predicted foot-and-mouth would cost the industry around \u00a35bn this spring and summer.</p> <p>But crisis for farmers has begun showing signs of easing. The government's chief scientific adviser, Professor David King, announced yesterday that the numbers of outbreaks appeared to be \"flattening out\".</p> <p>Although a firm date for eradicating the disease could not accurately be predicted, Prof King said latest figures showed there was now a steady decrease in the average number of new cases being recorded each day.</p> <p>The average number for the week ending April 8 stood at 32 a day, compared with 43 for the previous week.</p> <p>The reopening today of 1,000 miles of canal towpaths follows talks between Mr Prescott and British Waterways.</p> <p>Mr Prescott said he was confident that reopening the towpaths posed no risk of exacerbating the problems caused by the disease.</p> <p>He said: \"We have done a risk analysis. British Waterways had a helicopter along all the waterways to ensure there was no risk.\"</p> <p>\"Our priority is to eradicate foot and mouth disease in the UK. However, we must strike a balance between tackling the disease and reducing its impact on the rural economy, not just farming but all kinds of business, including tourism.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair was expected to stress that 60% of Easter tourism is made up of short trips by local people within their home region.</p> <p>He will say that he was encouraged yesterday to be told by farmers' leaders that they recognised the need to boost tourism as a way of getting the rural economy back to normal.</p> <p>Meanwhile, environment minister Beverley Hughes was due to announce a \u00a34m grant from the countryside agency to help local authorities speed up their review of footpath closures. The cash will help councils carry out risk assessments on footpaths and, where necessary, carry out remedial work such as the erection of fences to make them safe for use during the outbreak.</p> <p>In Cumbria, the county worst hit by foot and mouth, more than 100 footpaths will be open over Easter, and a further 60 are presently being assessed for reopening.</p> <p>As foot and mouth cases reached 1,225 yesterday, Prof King said improved culling times had fuelled hopes that the virus was finally being brought under control.</p> <p>Government targets to slaughter infected livestock within 24 hours and livestock on neighbouring farms within two days were increasingly being met, he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, preliminary test results on a suspected foot and mouth case in Northern Ireland have proved negative, it was announced today.</p> <p>Northern Ireland has so far had only one confirmed case of foot and mouth at a farm in South Armagh.</p> <p>The news will come as a massive relief to farmers who feared a ban on exports was going to be reintroduced.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Maff today said no more figures about the numbers of animals condemned by foot and mouth will be released until they are satisfied that latest statistics are both \"robust\" and \"accurate\".</p> <p>Shadow agriculture minister Tim Yeo described Maff's claim that there was no immediate need for fresh statistics as \"ludicrous\".</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair and John Prescott were today making further visits to countryside tourist attractions in an attempt to persuade Britons that foot and mouth should not stop them holidaying in the UK this Easter. The deputy prime minister visited the Grand Union Canal in Tring, Hertfordshire, to announce the reopening to walkers of 1,000 miles of towpaths - two thirds of the national total. The prime minister was set to make a trip to a seaside resort and country pub in Devon to drive home the point that, even in the areas worst hit by the disease, facilities were still open for visitors. Their efforts come amid predictions that some 1.75m Britons will flee foot and mouth and the forecasted showers by taking an Easter break abroad. Many tourism businesses are expecting trade to be significantly below normal over the Easter period - traditionally the first busy weekend of the holiday year. The British Hospitality Association yesterday predicted foot-and-mouth would cost the industry around \u00a35bn this spring and summer. But crisis for farmers has begun showing signs of easing. The government's chief scientific adviser, Professor David King, announced yesterday that the numbers of outbreaks appeared to be \"flattening out\". Although a firm date for eradicating the disease could not accurately be predicted, Prof King said latest figures showed there was now a steady decrease in the average number of new cases being recorded each day. The average number for the week ending April 8 stood at 32 a day, compared with 43 for the previous week. The reopening today of 1,000 miles of canal towpaths follows talks between Mr Prescott and British Waterways. Mr Prescott said he was confident that reopening the towpaths posed no risk of exacerbating the problems caused by the disease. He said: \"We have done a risk analysis. British Waterways had a helicopter along all the waterways to ensure there was no risk.\" \"Our priority is to eradicate foot and mouth disease in the UK. However, we must strike a balance between tackling the disease and reducing its impact on the rural economy, not just farming but all kinds of business, including tourism.\" Mr Blair was expected to stress that 60% of Easter tourism is made up of short trips by local people within their home region. He will say that he was encouraged yesterday to be told by farmers' leaders that they recognised the need to boost tourism as a way of getting the rural economy back to normal. Meanwhile, environment minister Beverley Hughes was due to announce a \u00a34m grant from the countryside agency to help local authorities speed up their review of footpath closures. The cash will help councils carry out risk assessments on footpaths and, where necessary, carry out remedial work such as the erection of fences to make them safe for use during the outbreak. In Cumbria, the county worst hit by foot and mouth, more than 100 footpaths will be open over Easter, and a further 60 are presently being assessed for reopening. As foot and mouth cases reached 1,225 yesterday, Prof King said improved culling times had fuelled hopes that the virus was finally being brought under control. Government targets to slaughter infected livestock within 24 hours and livestock on neighbouring farms within two days were increasingly being met, he said. Meanwhile, preliminary test results on a suspected foot and mouth case in Northern Ireland have proved negative, it was announced today. Northern Ireland has so far had only one confirmed case of foot and mouth at a farm in South Armagh. The news will come as a massive relief to farmers who feared a ban on exports was going to be reintroduced. \u0095 Maff today said no more figures about the numbers of animals condemned by foot and mouth will be released until they are satisfied that latest statistics are both \"robust\" and \"accurate\". Shadow agriculture minister Tim Yeo described Maff's claim that there was no immediate need for fresh statistics as \"ludicrous\".

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I came across a similar phenomenon while working in the US. I noticed that (and it stuck out a mile!) CNN referred to the British Army in Northern Ireland as \"the occupying British forces\". The inclusion of the one word \"occupying\" entirely changed the tone of the report.</p> <p>I've also noticed that despite the disproportionate number of Palestinians that have been killed over the last six or so months, Time magazine chose to print the pictures from the funeral of an Israeli victim.<br> <b>Dave Boyle, UK</b></p> <p>The article missed one important fact: some journalists refer to Camp David, and how it was designed to find a way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and occupation, of course. Arguably, Israel offered the Palestinians the most she could, consistent with her spiritual and demographic survival. The Palestinians rejected this offer.</p> <p>Palestinians have a legitimate right to fight occupation. But if they choose to do so after they have rejected Israeli offers to end the occupation, and after failing to make bridging proposals of their own, then the picture is somewhat more complicated. This is why many stories on the conflict state that the Palestinians rejected Israeli offers at Camp David, something I rarely find in Guardian reports.<br> <b>Avi Weinreb, Financial Journalist, Globes Business Newspaper, Israel</b></p> <p>A classic I have oft observed is the use of \"gunman\", always and only ever prefixed with the word - you know it already - \"Palestinian\". Never \"settler gunmen\" or even \"Israeli gunmen\", these don't even sound right together, but oh, \"Palestinian gunmen\" we've heard all about them.</p> <p>I don't know where the blame lies. I feel much is owed to the conditioning of the 70s / 80s media, when political use of the word \"terrorist\" justified every ethnic atrocity be it against the Lebanese or Palestinians. The nomenclature in this conflict has become accepted, part of the \"journalese\" that is deployed, and churned out by the Israeli PR team.</p> <p>Yet it is all part of the greater picture. I'm continually horrified by the psychological warfare that ordinary Palestinians experience even when their homes and 1000-year olive groves are not being bulldozed.<br> <b>Simon D'Oyly, London</b></p> <p>Let me point out a further example of sloppy journalism - the use of the term \"target\" to refer to Palestinian homes, villages, or cities subject to sniper or machine gun fire, artillery shelling, rockets, or bombing by the Israeli military (called, of course, \"Israeli Defence Forces\", as if \"defence\" were the name of the game). A target is there precisely to be shot at - a piece of paper with concentric rings on it - and shooting at targets evokes no terror.</p> <p>Having worked with journalists in China, I am aware that articles are not necessarily printed as dispatched. How much of the \"sloppy journalism\" referred to in the article originates with correspondents on the spot and how much to editors at home? <br> <b>M. Henri Day, Molde, Norway</b></p> <p>To argue (in the Guardian, of all places!) that Israel is \"winning\" the war of words regarding media coverage of the Middle East, is laughable.</p> <p>One only has to think about the complete absence of the word \"terrorism\" when the media describe the regular and wilful targeting by Palestinian bombers of Israeli civilians deep in the heart of sovereign Israeli territory, to see that the British media at least, has long since given up on telling the story as it is, preferring to regurgitate simplistic images - as Brian Whitaker has done himself - of the weak and just Palestinian underdog fighting off the aggressive, oppressive Israeli occupier.</p> <p>Or the use of the word \"intifada\", or uprising. The Guardian has been reporting for months that mass Palestinian protests have been replaced by regular drive-by shootings and other forms of guerrilla warfare, including mortars, but the paper and others like it still choose to refer to this violence as an \"intifada\" rather than what it is - a calculated unleashing of violence in order to secure diplomatic gain.</p> <p>Or the term \"hardline\". Is Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon the only Middle East leader worthy of such an appellation? Are none of the others also \"hardline\"? And if they are, why is that word not used for them too?</p> <p>Perhaps one of the most commonplace but insidious uses of particular terminology amongst the British media in covering this conflict is the consistent tendency to strip the Palestinian side of any volition or rationality, choosing instead to describe all Palestinian actions and reactions solely in emotional terms. By focusing incessantly on Palestinian \"anger\", the Western media regularly indulges the worst excesses of Palestinian behaviour, including the pre-meditated targeting of non-combatants, as if these actions are somehow explicable, and therefore tolerable, because of the seething emotions of Palestinian existence.</p> <p>How often do we hear and read of this Palestinian anger as the sole explanatory factor regarding the Palestinian side of events, as if, on the one hand, Israelis don't also have similar emotions, but worse, as if the Palestinians are somehow a nation apart, one whose members don't make choices like all other people? In fact, the choices made since Camp David by the Palestinian leadership are key to understanding how the violence erupted in September and has continued for every one of the 200 days since. But don't expect your liberal press to tell you that, because to portray the Palestinians as somehow culpable and responsible for their own actions would upset the pat template of innocent Palestinian victimhood.</p> <p>Of course, it is clear to all reasonable observers that the continued Israeli presence in the West Bank and Gaza remains a source of immense Palestinian frustration and dissatisfaction. Israel recognises this. Israel also recognises that in order to achieve its own aspirations of peace and security it must meet the Palestinians' own legitimate needs and aspirations. To balance these competing legitimacies is what we had - and need - a peace process for.</p> <p>But it seems not a little ironic that in an article which decries the lack of context in Middle East reporting, there is no mention whatsoever of the entire Oslo peace process, the immense progress that was made as part of that process along the road to full Palestinian empowerment and self-determination, the fact that it was the Palestinian side which rejected the compromises on the table but refused to suggest counter-proposals, and the fact that within that process - supported and sanctioned by Western governments and the overwhelming majority of the mainstream media - Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority undertook to resolve all disputes - including the question of the settlements - through peaceful means.</p> <p>Moreover, if its context we're looking for, then the blanket Arab rejection of Israel which preceded and precipitated the war of 1967 must also be factored in to the mix. When we hear that the Palestinians demand to this day not only their own state of Palestine but also an eternal claim on the State of Israel by dint of the co-called \"right of return\", then there is every reason to keep this historic and fundamental rejection of Israel's right to exist very much in one's mind when \"contextualizing\" current events.</p> <p>Ultimately, no matter what the journalists write, it is up to the sides to resolve their differences. Focusing on securing favourable media coverage, as so many of the Palestinians' actions over the last six months have been, is to miss the point entirely. The people they need to convince are not the media or the citizens of the west, but the Israelis.</p> <p>However, in light of the daily vitriol heaped upon Israel and Israelis in the Palestinian media, in their school textbooks, in summer camps where Palestinian children are taught to use rifles, in light of the continued failure of Yasser Arafat even once in the last six months to speak out against the resort to violence (there have been over 3,500 separate shooting incidents by Palestinians in that time), in light of the fact that the worst of the Palestinian terrorists continue to roam free in Palestinian cities and prepare their heinous attacks against ordinary Israelis (Arafat has a police force of 40,000 in case he should ever want to use it), there is serious cause for doubt as to whether the Palestinians are genuinely ready at this time to rejoin the process of historic reconciliation.</p> <p>As for the journalists - absolutely, bring on the context and the accurate use of language. Then at least Israel would win the war of words for real.<br> <b>DJ Schneeweiss, Press Secretary, Embassy of Israel, London</b></p> <p>As one who lives in the Arab world and works in public relations, I have discussed this issue many times with Arab friends and acquaintances (especially those who work in the media) and have been frustrated at the shrug of the shoulders that usually greets such observations. Such defeatism is, I believe, a result of the fact that they are a subject people, with a feeble, disorganised and corrupt leadership who feel powerless to confront in any way the machine - military and political - that faces them. The expressions of support that they receive from their Arab brethren are just that - expressions which though reflecting a genuine anguish for the human tragedy are about as substantial as a snowball in the desert.</p> <p>When asked how I would suggest they deal with this situation I have responded with a simple phrase - play the game. Get the vernacular agreed, ensure that your key journalists are identified and briefed regularly by people who don't look like they've just come from a building site, don't do interviews in front of chanting crowds, confront biased and unfair reporting, insist on equality of airspace.

      "bodyText": "I came across a similar phenomenon while working in the US. I noticed that (and it stuck out a mile!) CNN referred to the British Army in Northern Ireland as \"the occupying British forces\". The inclusion of the one word \"occupying\" entirely changed the tone of the report. I've also noticed that despite the disproportionate number of Palestinians that have been killed over the last six or so months, Time magazine chose to print the pictures from the funeral of an Israeli victim. Dave Boyle, UK The article missed one important fact: some journalists refer to Camp David, and how it was designed to find a way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and occupation, of course. Arguably, Israel offered the Palestinians the most she could, consistent with her spiritual and demographic survival. The Palestinians rejected this offer. Palestinians have a legitimate right to fight occupation. But if they choose to do so after they have rejected Israeli offers to end the occupation, and after failing to make bridging proposals of their own, then the picture is somewhat more complicated. This is why many stories on the conflict state that the Palestinians rejected Israeli offers at Camp David, something I rarely find in Guardian reports. Avi Weinreb, Financial Journalist, Globes Business Newspaper, Israel A classic I have oft observed is the use of \"gunman\", always and only ever prefixed with the word - you know it already - \"Palestinian\". Never \"settler gunmen\" or even \"Israeli gunmen\", these don't even sound right together, but oh, \"Palestinian gunmen\" we've heard all about them. I don't know where the blame lies. I feel much is owed to the conditioning of the 70s / 80s media, when political use of the word \"terrorist\" justified every ethnic atrocity be it against the Lebanese or Palestinians. The nomenclature in this conflict has become accepted, part of the \"journalese\" that is deployed, and churned out by the Israeli PR team. Yet it is all part of the greater picture. I'm continually horrified by the psychological warfare that ordinary Palestinians experience even when their homes and 1000-year olive groves are not being bulldozed. Simon D'Oyly, London Let me point out a further example of sloppy journalism - the use of the term \"target\" to refer to Palestinian homes, villages, or cities subject to sniper or machine gun fire, artillery shelling, rockets, or bombing by the Israeli military (called, of course, \"Israeli Defence Forces\", as if \"defence\" were the name of the game). A target is there precisely to be shot at - a piece of paper with concentric rings on it - and shooting at targets evokes no terror. Having worked with journalists in China, I am aware that articles are not necessarily printed as dispatched. How much of the \"sloppy journalism\" referred to in the article originates with correspondents on the spot and how much to editors at home? M. Henri Day, Molde, Norway To argue (in the Guardian, of all places!) that Israel is \"winning\" the war of words regarding media coverage of the Middle East, is laughable. One only has to think about the complete absence of the word \"terrorism\" when the media describe the regular and wilful targeting by Palestinian bombers of Israeli civilians deep in the heart of sovereign Israeli territory, to see that the British media at least, has long since given up on telling the story as it is, preferring to regurgitate simplistic images - as Brian Whitaker has done himself - of the weak and just Palestinian underdog fighting off the aggressive, oppressive Israeli occupier. Or the use of the word \"intifada\", or uprising. The Guardian has been reporting for months that mass Palestinian protests have been replaced by regular drive-by shootings and other forms of guerrilla warfare, including mortars, but the paper and others like it still choose to refer to this violence as an \"intifada\" rather than what it is - a calculated unleashing of violence in order to secure diplomatic gain. Or the term \"hardline\". Is Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon the only Middle East leader worthy of such an appellation? Are none of the others also \"hardline\"? And if they are, why is that word not used for them too? Perhaps one of the most commonplace but insidious uses of particular terminology amongst the British media in covering this conflict is the consistent tendency to strip the Palestinian side of any volition or rationality, choosing instead to describe all Palestinian actions and reactions solely in emotional terms. By focusing incessantly on Palestinian \"anger\", the Western media regularly indulges the worst excesses of Palestinian behaviour, including the pre-meditated targeting of non-combatants, as if these actions are somehow explicable, and therefore tolerable, because of the seething emotions of Palestinian existence. How often do we hear and read of this Palestinian anger as the sole explanatory factor regarding the Palestinian side of events, as if, on the one hand, Israelis don't also have similar emotions, but worse, as if the Palestinians are somehow a nation apart, one whose members don't make choices like all other people? In fact, the choices made since Camp David by the Palestinian leadership are key to understanding how the violence erupted in September and has continued for every one of the 200 days since. But don't expect your liberal press to tell you that, because to portray the Palestinians as somehow culpable and responsible for their own actions would upset the pat template of innocent Palestinian victimhood. Of course, it is clear to all reasonable observers that the continued Israeli presence in the West Bank and Gaza remains a source of immense Palestinian frustration and dissatisfaction. Israel recognises this. Israel also recognises that in order to achieve its own aspirations of peace and security it must meet the Palestinians' own legitimate needs and aspirations. To balance these competing legitimacies is what we had - and need - a peace process for. But it seems not a little ironic that in an article which decries the lack of context in Middle East reporting, there is no mention whatsoever of the entire Oslo peace process, the immense progress that was made as part of that process along the road to full Palestinian empowerment and self-determination, the fact that it was the Palestinian side which rejected the compromises on the table but refused to suggest counter-proposals, and the fact that within that process - supported and sanctioned by Western governments and the overwhelming majority of the mainstream media - Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority undertook to resolve all disputes - including the question of the settlements - through peaceful means. Moreover, if its context we're looking for, then the blanket Arab rejection of Israel which preceded and precipitated the war of 1967 must also be factored in to the mix. When we hear that the Palestinians demand to this day not only their own state of Palestine but also an eternal claim on the State of Israel by dint of the co-called \"right of return\", then there is every reason to keep this historic and fundamental rejection of Israel's right to exist very much in one's mind when \"contextualizing\" current events. Ultimately, no matter what the journalists write, it is up to the sides to resolve their differences. Focusing on securing favourable media coverage, as so many of the Palestinians' actions over the last six months have been, is to miss the point entirely. The people they need to convince are not the media or the citizens of the west, but the Israelis. However, in light of the daily vitriol heaped upon Israel and Israelis in the Palestinian media, in their school textbooks, in summer camps where Palestinian children are taught to use rifles, in light of the continued failure of Yasser Arafat even once in the last six months to speak out against the resort to violence (there have been over 3,500 separate shooting incidents by Palestinians in that time), in light of the fact that the worst of the Palestinian terrorists continue to roam free in Palestinian cities and prepare their heinous attacks against ordinary Israelis (Arafat has a police force of 40,000 in case he should ever want to use it), there is serious cause for doubt as to whether the Palestinians are genuinely ready at this time to rejoin the process of historic reconciliation. As for the journalists - absolutely, bring on the context and the accurate use of language. Then at least Israel would win the war of words for real. DJ Schneeweiss, Press Secretary, Embassy of Israel, London As one who lives in the Arab world and works in public relations, I have discussed this issue many times with Arab friends and acquaintances (especially those who work in the media) and have been frustrated at the shrug of the shoulders that usually greets such observations. Such defeatism is, I believe, a result of the fact that they are a subject people, with a feeble, disorganised and corrupt leadership who feel powerless to confront in any way the machine - military and political - that faces them. The expressions of support that they receive from their Arab brethren are just that - expressions which though reflecting a genuine anguish for the human tragedy are about as substantial as a snowball in the desert. When asked how I would suggest they deal with this situation I have responded with a simple phrase - play the game. Get the vernacular agreed, ensure that your key journalists are identified and briefed regularly by people who don't look like they've just come from a building site, don't do interviews in front of chanting crowds, confront biased and unfair reporting, insist on equality of airspace. And so on and so on. While the Arab media, in particular the satellite media, burn with discussions about how to deal with the situation the Palestinians' engagement with the rest of the world is lamentable. A Palestinian friend put it well: \"This is a family embarrassment. If the neighbours knock at the door we'll just keep quiet until they go away again.\" This failure to engage means that the only hope for the Palestinian position is that journalists will go through the slick Israeli media machine and begin doing what they're paid to do - report.

      "bodyText": "Black and Asian car workers at Ford Dagenham, in east London, have accused the company of failing to act against racist harassment and intimidation, despite a personal commitment 18 months ago by its global president, Jac Nasser, to stamp out discrimination at the plant. An investigation by Channel 4 News, due to be broadcast tonight, has recorded a catalogue of complaints of racist bullying at the engine plant as well as evidence of Ford's reluctance to discipline racist shopfloor officials. Barking and Dagenham race equality unit has also had more than 30 complaints of racist discrimination and harassment at the factory since Mr Nasser intervened in October 1999 to establish effective equal opportunities procedures throughout Ford's UK operation. Mr Nasser intervened after Ford admitted racial discrimination, harassment and victimisation of Sukhjit Parmar. Internal company documents show, however, that even though a company inquiry found a group of white employees - who had refused to work with Mr Parmar - responsible for racist abuse and threats of violence, no disciplinary action was taken. Some black workers say the refusal to discipline the group has emboldened other racists in the plant. A spokesman for Ford, which has submitted a full audit of its policies to tackle discrimination and harassment at the factory to the commission for racial equality, said last night that there were no \"quick fixes\" and that \"cultural change takes time\".",

From the works of Frank McCourt (Angela's Ashes) to those of Mary Karr (The Liar's Club), true tales of growing up among dysfunctional or dissolute elders found huge readerships and critical acclaim. Several new books point to a new variation on the memoir trend: the troubled-childhood memoir as told from the point of view of the parent. </p> <p>After a decade of writers describing the ways in which their lives have been made hell by their parents, these latest writers describe the ways in which their lives have been made hell by their children - or, more to the point, they try to figure out how it happened that they became the agents and witnesses of their own children's infernal descent. </p> <p>Augusta, Gone, by Martha Tod Dudman, is one such book. Dudman, a single mother of two who lives in Maine, gives an alarming account of her daughter Augusta's slide into the anomie and rebellion of teenagerdom. Augusta exhibits relatively harmless symptoms - the insistence on going barefoot even when it's raining, the adoption of Buddhism - but also those that are dramatically endangering: drug-taking, eating disorders, days-long disappearances to God knows where. </p> <p>Dudman rages at and wrestles with her daughter's disobedience; she tries grounding her, confronting her wayward friends and sending her off to a wilderness programme for out-of-control teens. Similarly, Hold Me Close, Let Me Go, by Adair Lara, a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, is an account of her daughter Morgan's perilous path from dyed hair to drug use and pregnancy at 16. Lara sends Morgan off to live with a series of relatives, who can't handle her either. </p> <p>It doesn't sound like much fun to be a mother to either Morgan or Augusta. \"She's so mean,\" Dudman says to herself at one point, a terrible thing to have to admit of one's own beloved child. </p> <p>As well as struggling with their daughters, both women struggle with their own guilt. Is all this happening because they got divorced? Because they worked? Because they smoked marijuana and rebelled when they were teenagers, too, and so their daughters are genetically predestined for a life off the rails? The girls are now in their late teens and early 20s, and have ended up more or less alright, which means that both books are essentially redemptive stories of risk and recovery. </p> <p>But they are also horror stories for baby boomer parents, a generation of parents who - as Susan Cheever, the author of another new memoir, As Good As I Could Be, argues - never expected to have to be adults themselves. Cheever's book, which is excerpted in the current issue of Talk magazine, is less a description of being the parent of a troubled, immature person than it is an account of being a troubled, immature person who happens to be a parent. </p> <p>Cheever - whose own father, John, was one of the great American chroniclers of the unhappy family, though he did it in fiction - writes of the trauma of realising that her daughter is younger and sexier than she is. Her daughter's adolescence has proved a rite of maternal passage: \"I had to let go of how I looked and what people might think of me.\" </p> <p>What's astonishing about Cheever's book is that its author should be hung up on the miseries of adolescence - all the fretting about weight and clothes, even at her age. \"For four decades now, I have been weighing myself in the morning and letting the numbers on the scale determine my mood,\" she writes. </p> <p>What's also astonishing is that Cheever doesn't feel the need to hide her own enduringly adolescent obsessions from her daughter. This is strange, because children like Cheever's daughter and Augusta and Morgan belong to the most protected and benignly policed generation in American history. These are the kids whose every Little League game and school play has been hovered over by their parents; whose self-esteem has been as tenderly nurtured as their growing bodies, and whose parents have tried to be their friends more than their disciplinarians. </p> <p>Such parental concern, it's clear, can't prevent teenagers from engaging in the kinds of potentially self-destructive behaviour that teenagers typically tend towards. Even if Augusta and Morgan's recklessness and experimentation are extreme, their behaviour is not different in kind from that attempted by many kids their age. </p> <p>The most remarkable thing about both Augusta and Morgan, rather than their temporary wildness, is that they have mothers who have written about their temporary wildness. </p> <p>Adair begins her book with an acknowledgement in which she says that Morgan \"was not thrilled at any time about the notion of a book about her wild teenage self\". </p> <p>And you might not be thrilled either, if your mother wrote about the time when your aunt complained about your provocative behaviour around the man she was dating, causing you to weep and say: \"I can't help it if I have big breasts.\" </p> <p>While it's impossible to guess whether these books will have positive or negative effects for Augusta or Morgan or Cheever's daughter, it is surprising, in a way, that the one thing these parents haven't tried to shield their children from is having their intimate lives on bookshelves everywhere. </p> <p><strong>Yuk! What's in the salad dressing?</strong> </p> <p>Over the past few days, Manhattanites have been grappling with reports of a truly disgusting crime.

The US porn market is already worth some $20bn (\u00a314bn) and is growing fast, and the internet allows customers who would otherwise be too embarrassed to enter a porn video store to purchase material. The pornography market in the US already accounts for the sale of some 185m DVDs each year and the market is expanding. Related articles 11.03.2001: How search turned to destroy Useful links Yahoo!

      "bodyText": "Senior political journalists are lamenting the news their highest-profile sparring partner, Alastair Campbell, is to step out of the ring after the next election. The Sun's political editor, Trevor Kavanagh, claims he will be \"irreplaceable\" for Tony Blair. \"The Tories have sought - without success - an Alastair Campbell figure for ages,\" he said. Mr Kavanagh, who is thought to have had a close professional relationship with Mr Campbell, said New Labour's chief spin doctor is \"both extremely adept and speaks the same political language as the prime minister\". Rod Liddle, the editor of the BBC's Today programme, which came under a barrage of criticism from Mr Campbell for alleged anti-government bias, said: \"I will be beside myself with grief at not having multiple daily phonecalls and emails from Alastair.\" The response of journalists across the industry to the news Mr Campbell, who was ruthless in his media manipulation, is to stand down, suggests his bruising style will be missed. Robin Oakley, the BBC's former political editor, who now works for CNN online, said the lobby \"will be a far less interesting place without him\". It is widely accepted Mr Campbell's decision to move away from his frontline press-handling role has been prompted by Mr Blair's desire to reduce the media focus on him. Last year, following mounting criticism of Mr Campbell's aggressive role in the government's media machine, Mr Blair and Mr Campbell took the decision to name him \"the prime minister's official spokesman\". His ruthless treatment of journalists in the press lobby, as well as his reputation for briefing against certain cabinet ministers, has led to him being accused of blurring the lines between legitimate PR and media manipulation. Mr Campbell has recently been accused of leaking stories selectively to certain newspapers - notably the Sun - in order to curry favour with the popular press. But Mr Kavanagh defended him, saying: \"I don't think his relationship with the Sun is any closer than his relationships with other newspapers. He's just as close to the Mirror or the Daily Mail.\" Although Mr Campbell is often credited with being the father of modern spin, defenders say he was merely carrying on a precedent established by his forefathers Joe Haines, the press secretary to Harold Wilson, and Bernard Ingham, the spokesman for Margaret Thatcher. However, Mr Oakley described Mr Campbell as \"the most effective political secretary of the past 30 years\". It is not yet known whether Mr Campbell will remain in the government's communications office after the next election. But it is widely believed Mr Blair wants him to remain at 10 Downing Street for a longer-term, strategic media planning role. Meanwhile, insiders say Mr Campbell, who is believed to have kept a diary of his tenure at the Downing Street communications unit, could write a book if he decided to leave the government.

Bones get progressively more brittle until they snap and when they do, it's bad news. One in six women taken to hospital with a hip fracture, will not come out alive and men fare even worse. But for some reason, we're not engaging with it as a serious problem: this week a survey found breathtaking ignorance amongst women about the disease. </p> <p>Unlike cancer, it is actually fairly easy to predict who is likely to get osteoporosis. \"At least 30% of the cause of osteoporosis is genetic,\" says expert Dr Gordana Prelevic. \"Any woman with a mum, grandmother or aunt who had a hip fracture is at greatly increased risk. We also know that women who don't have periods for long stretches of time because of anorexia, or because they breastfeed for a long time or go in to an early menopause, are at risk. Heavy smokers and very underweight women are also more prone.\" </p> <p>The chances of walking into a GP surgery and being offered unsolicited advice about preventing osteoporosis are extremely slim if you are a woman and next to nothing if you're a man. Finding out whether you have osteoporosis can also be tricky. Bone-density scanning, which is only available in some areas, can provide useful information. </p> <p>But the measurements are but one part in the complex mosaic of osteoporosis, which is really about fragile bones. Some women will have terrible bone density scans, but will never fracture a bone or get any pain, while others have reasonable bone density scans and have one fracture after another. \"If you know you are at risk of osteoporosis, because of your family history or because you have two or more of the other risk factors, you should take precautions against osteoporosis, regardless of whether or not you can get a bone density scan,\" warns Dr Prelevic. </p> <p>She is scathing about self-testing kits available in pharmacies throughout the land. \"They're rubbish! My local pharmacist in Hampstead was very apologetic to me for selling them, but she told me that people do ask for them, which is a shame because they can give people a false sense of security or cause unnecessary panic.\" </p> <p>So how do you guard against the disease in the future? Bones need calcium and vitamin D to keep them strong. There's a lot of emphasis on eating calcium rich foods such as milk, cheese and sardines to prevent osteoporosis, but vitamin D, which comes from animal fats in our diet and which we can also make ourselves when exposed to sunlight, may be the missing factor for many of us. \"Every other person that I see in my clinic in central London seems to be vitamin D deficient whereas most are eating enough calcium. We tend to associate vitamin D deficiency with Asian women who don't get much sunshine and eat vegan diets, but I see lots of non vegan Caucasians who need extra vitamin D too because our Northern hemisphere sunshine is too weak to be useful,\" says Dr Prelevic. </p> <p>The recommendation is that women under 65 who eat a well balanced diet are probably getting the right amount of calcium, namely 1000-1500mgs a day. Unless your diet is very low in calcium, that is less than 400mgs a day, you are unlikely to benefit much from calcium supplements. After the age of 65, taking a calcium supplement which includes vitamin D is wise, however good your diet. A little bit of vitamin D, contained in cod liver oil capsules, would do us all good, apparently. Regular exercise makes a big difference; it keeps bones strong and older people who keep exercising fall over less and are less prone to fractures. A glass of red wine a day's good for bones, but getting legless isn't. </p> <p>There is no perfect treatment for established osteoporosis. Dr Prelevic tends to suggest HRT for women in their 50s who have menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and early osteoporosis. For women who can't take HRT or don't want to, older women or men with severe osteoporosis, she prescribes alendronate (Fosamax), which causes stomach inflammation in up to a fifth of users, but can now happily be taken just once a week. This drug prevents destruction of bone, but only tiny amounts of it are actually absorbed and taking it with indigestion tablets can render it totally ineffective. </p> <p>Osteoporosis remains a worrying health problem that is just as likely to affect us as cancer is. If only cancer could be prevented by cod liver oil, a glass of wine, a walk round the park and a snooze in the sunshine, we'd all sleep easier tonight.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Forgive me if this article fails to make sense. If my sentences lack the odd crucial noun or verb or tail off inexplicably, please do not write in and complain. Try not to judge me too harshly if I let slip an irrational outburst. And if you detect a needlessly querulous tone, be tolerant. Indeed, count yourself lucky that you can't actually see me right now. You'd be shocked. I'm wild-eyed, dangerously pale and haggard. </p> <p>I laugh one minute, sob the next. I do not (despite what my family might say) have bi-polar disorder. I'm just severely sleep deprived. For the past 10 weeks I have had no more than two consecutive hours' sleep at any one time. And that's bad. I am a woman on the edge. </p> <p>If these symptoms ring a bell for you, and you have not been diagnosed with a mental illness, then you'll be glad to know that help is at hand. In the US, where more than one-third of the adult population is bothered by insomnia at least some of the time and 10 to 15% have chronic, unrelenting insomnia, researchers have just come up with a promising new treatment. A group of psychologists led by Dr Jack Edinger, at Duke University medical centre and the Durham VA medical centre, has found that cognitive behavioural therapy can overcome \"persistent primary insomnia\". In English this means: the tendency to keep waking up in the night is all in the mind and can be cured. </p> <p>Edinger's idea is that if you change your attitude to sleep, and then learn new habits, you can effectively reprogramme yourself to stay asleep until it's time to wake up without the aid of narcotics, alcohol or a blow to the head.

Worry all you want, just not in your bed. Ideally, you'll have already got it out of your system by setting aside \"thinking time\" earlier in the day - where you plan that mini-break, chew your nails about your late report, or fret about being spotted kicking the neighbour's cat. If you haven't done this, however, and wake up panicking, then you have to get out of bed, go to a separate room and panic there instead. You're not allowed to worry, plan, eat, watch TV or argue in bed. Bed is just for sleeping (sex, I imagine, may be permitted but possibly only if it's relaxing sex. No orgies or kinky stuff, please). </p> <p>Edinger's results are promising. He says: \"Many patients [in the study] were able to reach fairly normal levels of sleep with this treatment and without the use of sleeping pills, and the results lasted through six months of follow-up.\" This is good news on many levels, not least because doctors usually prescribe sedative hypnotics or antidepressants for insomnia, which are not a good idea for long-term treatment of chronic primary insomnia. </p> <p>So why hasn't anyone thought of this before? \"The sleep-medicine field is relatively new,\" says Edinger, \"and this study is unique in that it specifically targeted sleep maintenance insomnia, the largest subgroup.\" </p> <p>Curing this would be no minor achievement. Mood-related complaints are the most common manifestation of sleep deprivation - angry outbursts, mood swings, forgetfulness. Pair that with America's gun culture or indeed any British hospital and, well, it's enough to keep you up at night. </p> <p>There are other dangerous physical effects, too. Car accidents, for instance, are commonly a result of sleep deprivation. And insomniacs are, Edinger points out, \"more likely to seek health care than people who don't, and this puts a huge burden on the health care system\". </p> <p>The sad truth is that though I begged him for help, Edinger can do nothing for me. My night-time wakefulness stems from one thing, and one thing alone: a 10-week-old baby boy with the appetite of a small horse. But here's a tip for you: if Edinger's treatment doesn't work, have children. I used to be one of those anxious insomniac types. Now I'm pitifully grateful for any sleep I can get, night or day.

      "bodyText": "Forgive me if this article fails to make sense. If my sentences lack the odd crucial noun or verb or tail off inexplicably, please do not write in and complain. Try not to judge me too harshly if I let slip an irrational outburst. And if you detect a needlessly querulous tone, be tolerant. Indeed, count yourself lucky that you can't actually see me right now. You'd be shocked. I'm wild-eyed, dangerously pale and haggard. I laugh one minute, sob the next. I do not (despite what my family might say) have bi-polar disorder. I'm just severely sleep deprived. For the past 10 weeks I have had no more than two consecutive hours' sleep at any one time. And that's bad. I am a woman on the edge. If these symptoms ring a bell for you, and you have not been diagnosed with a mental illness, then you'll be glad to know that help is at hand. In the US, where more than one-third of the adult population is bothered by insomnia at least some of the time and 10 to 15% have chronic, unrelenting insomnia, researchers have just come up with a promising new treatment. A group of psychologists led by Dr Jack Edinger, at Duke University medical centre and the Durham VA medical centre, has found that cognitive behavioural therapy can overcome \"persistent primary insomnia\". In English this means: the tendency to keep waking up in the night is all in the mind and can be cured. Edinger's idea is that if you change your attitude to sleep, and then learn new habits, you can effectively reprogramme yourself to stay asleep until it's time to wake up without the aid of narcotics, alcohol or a blow to the head. His \"sleep education module\" teaches insomniacs good sleeping habits. But, as Edinger explains: \"First we anticipate certain common misconceptions such as how much sleep an individual actually needs.\" Most of us believe that without a minimum of eight hours' kip we'll die, or at least feel very rough.

They work by trawling through information from the records of millions of people. It is epidemiologists who assess the dangers of the contraceptive pill, whether ethnic minorities have equal access to health care and whether electricity pylons cause leukaemia. It is they who work out which treatment is best for breast cancer - and whether your GP might be quietly murdering old ladies in their homes. </p> <p>Because they work with whole populations, epidemiologists can see what is dangerous and what isn't, whether particular illnesses are becoming more or less common, what treatment works and what doesn't, and - in the case of surgeons - who is dangerous and who isn't. Epidemiology has helped save more lives than any of the other more glamorous branches of medicine. </p> <p>Every time a doctor advises you about your health or decides how best to treat you, he or she is using the evidence provided by epidemiologists. Universal clean water and sewage facilities, and advising people not to smoke, were among their most famous ideas. </p> <p>But all of this may have to come to an end. The General Medical Council (GMC) has decided that this kind of purely observational work is an infringement of patients' rights - even though it reveals nobody's identity and does nothing to alter or withold anyone's treatment. </p> <p>The GMC has declared that each study should go ahead only with every patients' expressed and informed consent, and that doctors should not provide data about their patients to any other doctors without that consent. It's a nice idea: patient autonomy and patient confidentiality are crucial, and it would be wrong to dismiss them out of hand. But because such consent is often unworkable - for a host of practical and scientific reasons - the change might stop epidemiology and clinical audit in their tracks and severely impede further advances in medicine. </p> <p>Ironically, epidemiologists and other doctors who use records purely for research and statistical purposes are the people in medicine who have taken confidentiality and data encryption most seriously. Anyone worried about the confidentiality of material relating to their health should be more concerned about the underpaid temporary staff working on the front desk of their local GP surgery than about a group of medical statisticians cooing over a meta-analysis of 50,000 cases of cancer. There are no scandals in epidemiology. </p> <p>The problem is that the data being shared must, at some stage, include the identity of the patient. Looking at how our world-renowned national net work of cancer registries works, you can see why. For decades, 11 cancer research centres around the country have collected morsels of data on patients afflicted with cancer in their region. From the type of cancer to how they were treated, from the details of their laboratory investigations to their death certificate, all the information is collated, stored and analysed in order to improve the care of the next generation of patients. </p> <p>There is a good reason that it is not possible for this information to be filed entirely anonymously, without identification of the patients attached. The cancer registry system collates data from innumerable diverse and unrelated bodies: the registrar of deaths in the town hall, the GP, the hospital pathologist. And the patient's identity is the only thing that unifies these disparate pieces of information, allowing the registry to match up tissue diagnosis with symptoms with death certificate and trace the life of one person's cancer. </p> <p>But it is not as if the information is being broadcast on the nine o'clock news. This is the confidential transfer of information between doctors, which is then held with obsessive security, with the doctors being accountable to the GMC if they treat the information irresponsibly. </p> <p>It is the most comprehensive national cancer database ever constructed and is the envy of the world. Every doctor in the country is expected to file data to the cancer registries on their patients. But the GMC has given a deadline of October 2001 for the cancer registries to put mechanisms in place for seeking and recording the consent of everyone on their books. Without this consent, doctors will have to stop the flow of information to them. Because this is impractical, cancer registries may have to close. </p> <p>But if the GMC wants us to, why can't we just ask people for consent? Can it really be so difficult? In some circumstances it may be, and not just for practical reasons. Insisting on consent can systematically skew the data, and give answers that are weaker, or simply wrong. </p> <p>If you ask people to agree to having their data used in an observational study, some will refuse. That, of course, is the reason you are asking them in the first place. And when they refuse, particularly if certain types of people are consistently more likely to refuse, such as the demented, the psychotic, the homeless, or those embarrassed by their health problems, that skews your data. </p> <p>This is what medical statisticians call \"consent bias\". It is important because it can turn your data on its head, render it useless and give the wrong conclusions. In medicine, that costs lives. </p> <p>There are unscalable practical barriers to seeking consent from the whole population. It remains a Herculean task even if, instead of considering specific cases with patients, we assume that we only want to ask everyone in the country the rather uninformative and vacuous question: \"Do you consent to your data being shared, on a confidential basis, for anything we can think of?\" There are 60 milion of us, after all. </p> <p>How quickly can you get informed consent, and explain why you want it? Will three minutes tacked on to the first consultation with a GP be enough? A tick-box? Who will keep a central record? What about the patient with Alzheimer's who can't give consent? What if you change your mind? What if you switch GPs? What if you never go to a GP, but just pitch up in A&amp;E one day? It is a far bigger undertaking than the census, and it is hard to imagine it ever happening. </p> <p>It would be far easier to legislate to protect the work of cancer registries and other organisations concerned with epidemiology and health services research, to ensure that the confidential data they need could never be used for non-medical purposes. That would protect the public and promote new medical knowledge. </p> <p>As a doctor, I don't expect patients just to tolerate the kind of work that the cancer registries and epidemiologists do: I believe they would be astonished if it weren't done. Epidemiology is the foundation on which all preventative medicine is based. Without it, much would be just anecdote and small drug trials. This move to tie its legs together can only be motivated by some unthinking adherence to an abstract philosophical doctrine about privacy. The point of the principle of confidentiality was to protect the patient from untoward disclosure of information which could be used to his or her detriment. It should not be a moral absolute, at so great a cost. </p> <p>Is our adherence to principles about privacy so important that we would sagely shave months or years off our life expectancies? I'd rather have another birthday, thanks.</p>",

There are unscalable practical barriers to seeking consent from the whole population. It remains a Herculean task even if, instead of considering specific cases with patients, we assume that we only want to ask everyone in the country the rather uninformative and vacuous question: \"Do you consent to your data being shared, on a confidential basis, for anything we can think of?\" There are 60 milion of us, after all. How quickly can you get informed consent, and explain why you want it? Will three minutes tacked on to the first consultation with a GP be enough? A tick-box? Who will keep a central record? What about the patient with Alzheimer's who can't give consent? What if you change your mind? What if you switch GPs? What if you never go to a GP, but just pitch up in A&amp;E one day? It is a far bigger undertaking than the census, and it is hard to imagine it ever happening. It would be far easier to legislate to protect the work of cancer registries and other organisations concerned with epidemiology and health services research, to ensure that the confidential data they need could never be used for non-medical purposes. That would protect the public and promote new medical knowledge. As a doctor, I don't expect patients just to tolerate the kind of work that the cancer registries and epidemiologists do: I believe they would be astonished if it weren't done. Epidemiology is the foundation on which all preventative medicine is based. Without it, much would be just anecdote and small drug trials. This move to tie its legs together can only be motivated by some unthinking adherence to an abstract philosophical doctrine about privacy. The point of the principle of confidentiality was to protect the patient from untoward disclosure of information which could be used to his or her detriment. It should not be a moral absolute, at so great a cost. Is our adherence to principles about privacy so important that we would sagely shave months or years off our life expectancies? I'd rather have another birthday, thanks.",

I was woken at five to eight by Clara, a surgical house officer whom I find rather dishy, bouncing up and down on my bed in the on-call doctor's room, and shouting: \"Wakey-wakey, Dr Sleepyhead. Your ward round awaits.\" After a routine check that my genitalia have not fallen out of the front of my theatre blues (a hazard of using them as pyjamas) I spring up and pull on a white coat for the morning round. </p> <p>You cannot begin to imagine the pain and misery of a night on call, followed by a day at work. If you could, you probably wouldn't all keep coming in at three in the morning with that bit of tummy ache that has been troubling you for six months. </p> <p>On the whole, I am not terribly impressed with your pain thresholds; not to mention common sense. \"Go back to bed,\" I am tempted to write in the notes as my clinical plan, \"and leave me alone.\" But that is not what they want: they want hospital lights, and hospital beds, and hospital hysteria. </p> <p>\"Ooh, I was up at that hospital the other night,\" you can hear them saying, after being sent packing next morning. \"Accident and Emergency it was. They had me on one of them drips and everything. They still never found out what it was.\" </p> <p>Yes we did. You had tummy ache. Now go to bed and be good. You know for sure that they wouldn't do it if it wasn't free of charge. </p> <p>At least in this job we get a cosy on-call room on a staircase near the wards. In my last job we had to sprint 100 yards across open gangland territory in central London at three in the morning when the cardiac arrest bleep went off. And, of course, now I've got this new job, now I'm a surgeon, I don't have to do too much thinking because you only ever see the same five things over and over again and because thinking isn't butch enough for surgeons. Surgeons stand in theatre looking hard, and calling their house officers \"big girls\" for not being able to hold retractors for hours on end. They don't like to think. It makes their willies hurt. </p> <p>So, after I flourished my sleepy way through the new admissions (two lots of appendicitis, one sub-acute obstruction and three tummy aches), we stumbled across an patient I had seen, who was \"short of breath\" and coughing up goo overnight. Needless to say, without pausing for breath I had instituted the patented Foxton Triple Therapy for chest symptoms: antibiotics in case it was an infection, diuretics in case it was heart failure, and a salbutamol nebuliser, partly on the off-chance that she had a bit of chronic lung disease, and partly because those big see-through masks with clouds of mist coming out of them look fabulously pneumatic and Victorian, an aesthetic our elderly patients often seem to appreciate. </p> <p>The registrar was not impressed. Deciding for the first time in his life to take an interest in the medical management of our surgical patients, he held his hand aloft theatrically. \"It is as if,\" he said, with a grandiose smile, \"you had walked into a darkened room filled with flies, and started firing rounds from a machine gun at the walls.\" </p> <p>We all peered at the silver pan of poo that the nurse had brought for us. It contained a puddle of green and red semi-formed stool, which smelled metallic and vegetal in the way that only antibiotic-induced pseudomembranous colitis does. I was definitely not guilty: she had only been on the drugs for 12 hours. \"Well done, doctor. And with which 10 drugs will you be attacking her bowel to reverse the effect?\" </p> <p>The Evil Sister on Ward 7B stared at me. I froze, immobilised by the injustice of it all, and the complex damage limitation analysis running through my brain. Should I mention that it was his 12 days of cefuroxime and metronidazole which had trashed her bowels? \"Blink if you can hear me, Dr Foxton.\" Clearly not. Should I chance a matey comment to defuse the atmosphere? Something implicitly sexist, perhaps? They seem to like those ones. </p> <p>He walked over and put his mouth menacingly close to my ear.

The Australian tycoon needs cash to complete the \u00a348bn acquisition of DirecTV's parent company Hughes Electronics, and he has earmarked the sale of Hughes subsidiary PanAmSat as a guaranteed money-spinner. Mr Murdoch will use the \u00a33.5bn he would get from a PanAmSat sale to buy out the owner of Hughes, General Motors, leaving his News Corp empire as the major shareholder in DirecTV. However, industry observers and analysts are beginning to doubt whether a buyer for the company can be found owing to growing doubts over the firm's value. One senior source at a rival satellite operator, which had run the rule over PanAmSat, said the company's revenues were not as good as they seem. \"If you look at the figures they have produced, they have a lot of these increases which are due to one-time sell-offs,\" the source said. \"They are selling satellite capacity and the income from this is a one-off which will not be recurring next year.\" PanAmSat reported revenues of \u00a3710m last year, but \u00a3169m of that income came from selling transponder capacity, which represents a one-off gain. Analysts are also voicing doubts about the consistency of the company's income, saying it could put off potential buyers. \"It makes it very difficult to analyse the company and predict the earnings per share, and makes it complicated for buyers. There are not a lot of buyers out there because the market cap is so big. \"No private venture capitalists could buy it, and I think the biggest issue for PanAmSat is finding a company to acquire it,\" said David Kestenbaum, analyst at ING Baring. Luxembourg-based Societe Europeenne des Satellites was the favourite to step in, but it recently fulfilled its US ambitions with the \u00a35bn acquisition of General Electric's GE Americom subsidiary. That leaves Eutelsat and Intelsat as potential buyers, although neither company has publicly admitted an interest in the GM subsidiary. It is well known that GM wants as much cash as possible from the DirecTV deal, but the \u00a36.2bn debt pile at News Corp means that Mr Murdoch needs PanAmSat as an alternative source of capital. A PanAmSat spokesman refused to confirm the company was up for sale, but it is set to become one the trickier \"moving parts\" that Mr Murdoch has blamed for holding up the DirecTV deal. However, many observers still believe the tenacious tycoon will pull off his biggest ever acquisition and add the final touch to his Sky Global Networks satellite group, which includes BSkyB in the UK and StarTV in Asia. \"I don't think the game is up because no one else is interested. Mr Murdoch is probably the only guy in town on this one,\" said one New York-based fund manager. A News Corp spokesman said there have been no further developments on the DirecTV deal, which appears to have stalled because GM and Hughes Electronics want more cash. A Hughes merger with US rival Echostar has been mooted, but it is likely to fall foul of competition watchdogs, and other likely bidders such as Microsoft and Liberty Media have already given financial backing to Mr Murdoch's bid. PanAmSat announces its first quarter earnings on Monday. Related stories 06.04.2001: Murdoch shrugs off DirecTV bid 22.03.2001: New threat to Murdoch DirecTV takeover",

His immediate thought is to load a shotgun and seek violent retribution, but he is persuaded by Murphy that the best way to get back at rich people is to hit them where it hurts - in their wallets.</p> <p>Politicians in Europe have - metaphorically speaking - been looking for their shotguns since George Bush said that the United States would not abide by its commitments under the Kyoto agreement on global warming. The president's view is that cutting emissions of greenhouse gases would be bad for the US economy. And in the president's scheme of things, the US economy comes first, second and third. The big polluters of corporate America have received a quick payback for all that campaign funding.</p> <p>Bush's repudiation of the Kyoto protocols has caused outrage in other countries, not because the Americans under Clinton were cutting carbon dioxide emissions (they weren't) but because Bush made it abundantly clear that he thought the US's economic might meant that it could blow a raspberry at the rest of the world. A European Union mission was sent to Washington but, predictably enough, returned empty-handed.</p> <p>But all is not lost. There is a way the rest of the world could respond effectively to American selfishness because it is the rest of the world that is bankrolling the excessive consumption that, in part, is the reason for the US's high CO&lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions. As can be seen from the first chart, US greenhouse gas emissions per head are the highest in the developed world for any country other than Luxembourg. There are a number of reasons for this, including the fact that - as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development noted in its annual health check on the US last year - consumption of fossil fuels is encouraged by gasoline prices being too low.</p> <p>So, with driving cheap and the economy growing rapidly, Americans have bought more cars and bigger cars over the past decade, and vast quantities of other consumer goods. The consequences of all this over-consumption are highlighted by the second chart, which shows what has been happening to the US current account in recent years.</p> <p>The burgeoning deficit is clear evidence that the US is living beyond its means. But the current account - broadly trade in goods and services - only makes up one half of a nation's balance of payments. The other half is the capital account, which shows whether a country is a net importer or a net exporter of capital, either in the form of direct investment in new plant or through the buying and selling of financial assets. Since the balance of payments should, by definition, balance, a deficit on the current account has to be matched by an equivalent surplus on the capital account. In reality measurement problems mean that this does not always happen, but as the US current account has risen, so it has increased its dependency on capital flows from the rest of the world.</p> <p>The amount it sucked in to finance its spending habit more than tripled from $113.3bn in 1995 to $399.1bn last year as the current account headed towards the record deficit of $435.4bn in 2000. Savers in Germany and Japan are indirectly allowing American consumers to carry on polluting at the current rate. This burden will increase if Bush uses up the US budget surplus to finance tax cuts, since at least under Clinton the failure of consumers to save was partly offset by the government saving for them. But without savers in the rest of the world, US consumers would have to consume less and save more, and the result of that would be a considerable slowdown in US growth.</p> <p>The policy implications of this should be quite clear: Bush is free to say that the US will break its Kyoto commitments, but the rest of the world is equally free to respond by cutting off the flow of funds to finance the US current account deficit. For Bush the consequences would be far more severe than abiding by Kyoto, with an almighty crash on Wall Street and - as Robert McTeer, the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, admitted last week - a collapse in the value of the dollar. \"Capital inflows are holding the dollar up despite the negative tone of the current account deficit,\" he said, adding that for the moment the US remained an attractive place for the world's savers. \"If something should happen to cause them to lose faith, then there would be a problem and a dramatic downward pressure on the dollar.\"</p> <p>Of course, a deliberate attempt by Europe and Japan to stem the flow of capital to the US could be seen as a classic example of cutting off your nose to spite your face, because a sustained US downturn would have knock-on effects on the rest of the world. But there are several points that need to be made. The first is that a day of reckoning is coming for the US. At some point the days of live-now-pay-later will have to stop. A rebalancing of the global economy, with a smaller US current account deficit and a smaller Japanese current account surplus is much to be desired.</p> <p>The second point is that the Europeans and the Japanese would never need to make their threat explicit. A quiet word at a meeting of G7 finance ministers, backed up with a juicy non-attributable quote to the press would have the alarm bells ringing in the White House within five minutes. Third, while Tokyo might not want to see an appreciation of the yen against the dollar at a time when the Japanese economy is so weak, the Europeans would certainly like a stronger euro, which would facilitate lower interest rates and restore some pride in the single currency. Finally, the idea that the big financial institutions are a law unto themselves and would refuse to cooperate is a myth. French banks, for example, rarely say anything negative about the euro because it has been made clear that the ministry of finance finds such behaviour \"unhelpful\".</p> <p>Will this be contemplated? It depends on how serious the world is about global warming and how willing it is to stand up to the US. But let nobody say that there is nothing that can be done.

      "body": "<p>The Downing Street website has recently added a personal appeal from Tony Blair to tourists thinking of visiting Britain. \"We are doing everything we can to get over the message - at home and abroad - that the whole of the UK is open for business, as indeed it is,\" the prime minister says.</p> <p>In his internet appeal, Tony Blair criticised the foreign press for its coverage of foot and mouth, saying: \"I've seen some of the foreign news broadcasts about the impact of foot and mouth disease on Britain. I can promise you that they paint a picture of our country which bears little relation to reality.\"</p> <p>But foreign correspondents based in the UK argue that - despite the government's formidable reputation for spin - No 10 is barely trying to communicate its message abroad.</p> <p>American and EU journalists expected to have been wooed by No 10 since the outbreak of foot and mouth, as vital conduits for getting the message across. Instead they have been cold-shouldered.</p> <p>Catherine Mayer is a London correspondent for Focus, a German news magazine: \"A week ago I had an irritating set of phone conversations with Maff when they showed no inclination to put up one of their scientific advisors to brief us. We're trying to report responsibly and tackle some of the wilder scare stories circulating abroad, but they're not providing the backup to enable us to do so.\"</p> <p>She is not alone. Philippe Le Corre, London bureau chief of La Tribune, has been trying to arrange for a minister to hold a briefing for foreign journalists at the FPA for weeks. He is surprised at how hard it has been: \"On the one hand, the government has never been so pro-active at promoting Britain as a tourist destination for foreigners, on the other, Maff seems unwilling to give UK-based correspondents access.\"</p> <p>Jef McAllister was a reporter at the White House during the Clinton presidency and is now London bureau chief of Time magazine. He feels that the attitude of the Blair government to foreign reporters has a striking similarity to the Clinton administration.</p> <p>\"The Democrats turned their time in office into a continuous campaign for re-election and support,\" he says. \"This inevitably meant that foreign journalists got second-rate treatment.\"</p> <p>This approach might work in normal times - but it is not the way to lessen the economic impact of foot and mouth disease. Teresa Wickham, chairwoman of the London tourist board, says: \"Americans are very confused and are connecting the issues of BSE and foot and mouth. London is a key gateway for foreign tourists and the US is the No 1 market for tourists coming to the UK - 2.7m US visitors came to London alone last year.\"</p> <p>But, while many of the scare stories that are damaging the tourist trade are being written by foreign correspondents, government departments have not woken up to the risk.</p> <p>Ms Mayer feels that lessons from the BSE crisis have not been learnt. She says: \"The government press offices are impenetrable and unaccountable, and it's a matter of luck whether you get someone helpful on the phone. There was a change when Labour came into power, when there was a real air of excitement and desire to communicate the big, new, policy initiatives.</p> <p>\"But they have now largely returned to the bad old ways. As a foreign correspondent you become used to institutional rudeness.\"</p> <p>It is ironic that a government so famed for spin does not seem able to master effective information campaigns for foreign journalists.</p> <p>Mrs Wickham believes governement departments should make foreign correspondents a \"key target\" for information.</p> <p>She says: \"It is very important that everything possible is done to help them get access to the facts and to challenge the myths.\"</p> <p>If the UK is to put out a strong message to the world on positive issues and in crises, it will need to learn how to deal with foreign journalists more effectively.</p> <p>\u0095 Nik Hole is a freelance writer, specialising in the foreign media<br> <a href=\"mailto:nik@shevolution.com\">Nik@shevolution.com</a></p> <p><b>Special report</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,9061,470404,00.html\">12.04.2001: Your countryside needs you!</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,9061,469796,00.html\">07.04.2001: 'Britain is open,' beaming Blair tells tourists</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,9061,469414,00.html\">06.04.2001: \u00a3120m in loans offered as tourism lifeline</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.westminster-digital.co.uk/realservers/ram?number10/weekly/weekly2001-03-29.rm \">Mr Blair's personal appeal</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">MAFF: Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.latribune.qc.ca/\" target=\"_new\">La Tribune</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Downing Street website has recently added a personal appeal from Tony Blair to tourists thinking of visiting Britain. \"We are doing everything we can to get over the message - at home and abroad - that the whole of the UK is open for business, as indeed it is,\" the prime minister says. In his internet appeal, Tony Blair criticised the foreign press for its coverage of foot and mouth, saying: \"I've seen some of the foreign news broadcasts about the impact of foot and mouth disease on Britain. I can promise you that they paint a picture of our country which bears little relation to reality.\" But foreign correspondents based in the UK argue that - despite the government's formidable reputation for spin - No 10 is barely trying to communicate its message abroad. American and EU journalists expected to have been wooed by No 10 since the outbreak of foot and mouth, as vital conduits for getting the message across. Instead they have been cold-shouldered. Catherine Mayer is a London correspondent for Focus, a German news magazine: \"A week ago I had an irritating set of phone conversations with Maff when they showed no inclination to put up one of their scientific advisors to brief us. We're trying to report responsibly and tackle some of the wilder scare stories circulating abroad, but they're not providing the backup to enable us to do so.\" She is not alone. Philippe Le Corre, London bureau chief of La Tribune, has been trying to arrange for a minister to hold a briefing for foreign journalists at the FPA for weeks. He is surprised at how hard it has been: \"On the one hand, the government has never been so pro-active at promoting Britain as a tourist destination for foreigners, on the other, Maff seems unwilling to give UK-based correspondents access.\" Jef McAllister was a reporter at the White House during the Clinton presidency and is now London bureau chief of Time magazine. He feels that the attitude of the Blair government to foreign reporters has a striking similarity to the Clinton administration. \"The Democrats turned their time in office into a continuous campaign for re-election and support,\" he says. \"This inevitably meant that foreign journalists got second-rate treatment.\" This approach might work in normal times - but it is not the way to lessen the economic impact of foot and mouth disease. Teresa Wickham, chairwoman of the London tourist board, says: \"Americans are very confused and are connecting the issues of BSE and foot and mouth. London is a key gateway for foreign tourists and the US is the No 1 market for tourists coming to the UK - 2.7m US visitors came to London alone last year.\" But, while many of the scare stories that are damaging the tourist trade are being written by foreign correspondents, government departments have not woken up to the risk. Ms Mayer feels that lessons from the BSE crisis have not been learnt. She says: \"The government press offices are impenetrable and unaccountable, and it's a matter of luck whether you get someone helpful on the phone. There was a change when Labour came into power, when there was a real air of excitement and desire to communicate the big, new, policy initiatives. \"But they have now largely returned to the bad old ways. As a foreign correspondent you become used to institutional rudeness.\" It is ironic that a government so famed for spin does not seem able to master effective information campaigns for foreign journalists. Mrs Wickham believes governement departments should make foreign correspondents a \"key target\" for information. She says: \"It is very important that everything possible is done to help them get access to the facts and to challenge the myths.\" If the UK is to put out a strong message to the world on positive issues and in crises, it will need to learn how to deal with foreign journalists more effectively. \u0095 Nik Hole is a freelance writer, specialising in the foreign media Nik@shevolution.com Special report Foot and mouth Related articles 12.04.2001: Your countryside needs you! 07.04.2001: 'Britain is open,' beaming Blair tells tourists 06.04.2001: \u00a3120m in loans offered as tourism lifeline Audio Mr Blair's personal appeal Useful links MAFF: Foot and mouth La Tribune",

The news group has made an offer for several Bridge assets, including the company's brokerage business, its bond data and analysis operation and its eBridge internet arm. The move is an abrupt change in stance for Reuters, after Tom Glocer, chief executive of Reuters, recently scorned the attractiveness of the Bridge businesses. However, Bridge is in dire financial difficulties following a three-year acquisition spree. Reuters has been unable to resist the temptation of snapping up its assets on the cheap.

Sussex-based Shippam's has been alerted that chicken condemned as unfit for human consumption could have been used in its products by mistake. Bosses have now recalled its meat pastes and some other products as \"a precautionary measure\". The scare comes after an investigation centred on a pet food-processing plant near Ripley, Derbyshire. Derbyshire police last month arrested 19 people in connection with the scare. No one has yet been charged. A spokesman for Shippam's said that it had been alerted by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that \"substandard\" chicken could have been used in some of its products. He said: \"There is no food safety risk but the product recall is the responsible action to take.\" A spokesman for the FSA said: \"Shippam's are taking this action as they may unwittingly have received and used in their products meat condemned as unfit for human consumption. \"This is a precautionary measure. It is highly unlikely that there would be any health risks from these highly processed products.\" Customers who have already bought the products should take them to shops for a full refund.

      "body": "<p><strong>What makes us so special? </strong></p> <p>Sunderland can truly claim to be a real club run by fans for the fans. I can't think of another club where the chairman and the board have such a good relationship with the supporters. There's a real sense of everyone pulling in the same direction to try and make us one of the biggest clubs in Europe. We certainly have the fans to do it-it's up to the manager and chairman to provide us with the team.</p> <p><strong>The high points</strong></p> <p>Undoubtedly beating Leeds in the 1973 FA Cup final. Leeds had a phenomenal side at the time, and we were in the Second Division, as it was then. Bob Stokoe did wonders with that side. I think he could have walked on water that year. More recently, our 2-1 victories at St. James' Park were special moments, especially after all the stick their fans have given us over the last ten years. Winning the First Division with 105 points was a very pleasing experience, especially after losing to Charlton in the play-off final the year before.</p> <p><strong>The low points</strong></p> <p>There have been several relegations over the years, and the hardest to take until recently was the demotion to the old Division Three on away goals, after extra-time. However, that pales into insignificance compared to losing that play-off final. To lose out on the Premiership on penalties after a 46-game season was a uniquely soul-destroying experience. There were over 40,000 Mackems at Wembley that day-and even the most hard-bitten of us had a lump in our throats after that one. Someone at work congratulated me on being part of such a memorable game, but I couldn't quite see it that way.</p> <p><strong>What's going on at the moment? </strong></p> <p>We've had a bit of a dodgy run, which is starting to threaten our dreams of European football for next season. Unlike last season, we've not played badly during this poor run, and have not been helped by a series of poor and questionable refereeing decisions. It's not just us moaning - the video evidence has been clearly in our favour on the majority of these occasions. It's very frustrating, because if those decisions have gone our way, we'd be well in the running for a Champions League spot. Off the field, the chairman has just announced reduced season ticket prices for next season (at least \u00a320 off each ticket). This was a goodwill gesture to the fans for their magnificent support, home and away.</p> <p><strong>Last fixture</strong></p> <p>At the time of writing, it was against Leeds at the SOL, and we lost 2-0. We didn't play great, we didn't play that bad. There was the customary iffy refereeing decision at 0-0, and Leeds went straight up the other end and scored. It was disappointing to lose, especially after our fine win at Chelsea the week before.</p> <p><strong>Next fixture</strong></p> <p>At the time of writing, the next game is at Middlesborough. They need the points as much as we do, and it is a must win game for us if we are serious about Europe for next season. Incidentally, we don't consider Boro to be our rivals; they're just a small town in Yorkshire. [The game ended goal-less.]</p> <p><strong>Will we qualify for Europe? </strong></p> <p>In a word, yes. Our destiny is in our own hands. We have seven games left, all against sides below us in the league. We have a very determined and skilful bunch of players who will give their all to achieve this aim. I'm confident we will do it.</p> <p><strong>Should Kevin Phillips play for England? </strong></p> <p>Kevin has never been given the chances that Andy Cole has. He has not been in the sensational form of last year, but he's still scored 15 goals, despite having no pre-season due to injury. He is a quality finisher, and has a much-improved all-round game this year. He offers far more for the future than, say, Teddy Sheringham. If Eriksson picks Ted, he has to play him, especially at 34. Phillips will score goals at international level, but only if he gets a chance to! With Cole out for the next qualifier, Eriksson must have a look.</p> <p><strong>Sore point</strong></p> <p>One thing that irks a lot of fans is our treatment in the press. We are often made out to be some sort of northern Wimbledon, and rarely get the credit we deserve in the press. It's frankly a disgrace to insinuate that we are a hump-and-hoof-it-forward team. Yes, we do have Niall Quinn up front, and him being six foot four, it makes a degree of sense to use his aerial power! Sunderland have a side packed full of internationals, an average gate of over 47,000 at home, and always sell out their full away allocations. There's not a lot in common with Wimbledon in that lot, is there?</p> <p><strong>Manager</strong></p> <p>Peter Reid has done a fantastic job, turning the club round from relegation candidates in the First Division to European challengers in six years. He is a real players' manager, and his strong points are man-management and getting players to play for him. He has created a superb team spirit, and brought in some real quality players in his time at the club. He is a real stubborn bugger though, and woe betide anyone player who crosses him. He is supposedly on the verge of signing a new \u00a36m, four-year contract, which is well deserved. He now has to take the club forward into Europe, and make us serious challengers for the Premiership.</p> <p><strong>The chairman</strong></p> <p>Bob Murray has a dream of making Sunderland one of the biggest clubs in Europe, and is making a very good attempt at doing so. Murray was the driving force behind the Stadium of Light, and like all good chairmen, keeps out of the limelight much of the time. Whilst he is nominally in charge, it's Reid who basically runs the club. Although a native Yorkshireman, he has been a lifelong Sunderland fan, and has not forgotten his modest family roots despite being a successful multi-millionaire businessman. You can see that he has a feel for the ordinary man in the street, and he puts the priorities of these supporters well above that of the corporate \"fan\". This is a refreshing change in this day and age.</p> <p><strong>Rivals</strong></p> <p>Our rivals are Ne*c*stle United, and no-one else. There is a great deal of \"feeling\" between the two sets of supporters, a bit like Celtic-Rangers without the sectarianism. We have had to put up with their taunts of how superior they are, how they are a massive club (second only to Barcelona in Europe, apparently) and other such rubbish over the last ten years. The truth is that they've spent a fortune on mediocre players, owe a fortune to the banks, and have won precisely NOWT. And their ground is a lop-sided carbuncle.</p> <p><strong>Kit</strong></p> <p>We are in the first year of a deal with Nike, and the current kit is fairly traditional, save the all black socks. My favourite kit was the one we wore when we won the Cup in 1973, despite those floppy collars. The worst kit ever was the nasty pinstripe effort with red shorts in the days of Ally McCoist, in the early eighties. There is talk of a third strip in Internazionale colours, to compliment our all-white away kit.</p> <p><strong>Most ridiculous piece of merchandise</strong></p> <p>For some reason, I find the idea of \"club\" chocolates and wine a bit daft. Why should a football club want to be associated with such items? You can just imagine the reaction of your beloved lady if you presented her with a box of SAFC chocolates. You might need to pay a visit to casualty to get them removed.</p> <p><strong>Mascots</strong></p> <p>We originally had a black cat called Samson, and now he's got a mate called Delilah. Samson is definitely a bit of a lad. He was allegedly spotted drinking in a pub near Prenton Park a few years ago. He is very popular with the kids, and is known for taking the mickey of opposing mascots/fans.</p> <p><strong>Players rated</strong></p> <p>Don Hutchison is currently flavour of the month, which is no mean feat given his Geordie roots. He is surely the bargain of the season at \u00a32.5m. Phillips and Quinn have been superb over the last four years, and McCann is starting to fulfil his enormous promise. As for other teams, I really rate Steven Gerrard, and Roy Keane was absolutely outstanding against us earlier this year. Marcus Stewart has been superb this year, and has done a Phillips. It will be interesting to see what happens to him in his second season.</p> <p><strong>Players hated</strong></p> <p>Kevin Kilbane seems to be the target of the boo boys at the minute, which is a shame as he had a pretty good start to the season. As for other clubs, well it has to be Alan Shearer. Not only did Shearer allegedly say that he didn't like playing with Phillips for England, but he also took the rise out of the Fulwell End at the end of the last derby at Roker. Needless to say, his penalty miss in last November's derby was greeted with universal acclaim on Wearside. I think most people saw it as poetic justice.</p> <p><strong>The Stadium of Light</strong></p> <p>The new ground is a vast improvement on the dilapidated Roker Park. With excellent views from every seat, and much better catering facilities, supporters are well looked after. However, trying to go for a half-time 'comfort break' is never easy, or quick. There are plenty of toilets, but the planners failed to account for the thirst of the average Sunderland supporter.</p> <p><strong>Atmosphere on match days</strong></p> <p>The bowl of the stadium seems to help the noise generated, so the atmosphere is usually good. The big games are something special, as you can sense that the fans are really up for these games. When Phillips scored the equaliser in last year's derby, the roof nearly came off. I've never heard a noise so loud at any football match I've ever been to.</p> <p><strong>What to do before the match</strong></p> <p>There are numerous watering holes in Sunderland City Centre, which is only ten minutes walk from the ground. A more extensive guide can be found on the website. Sunderland is quite a good place to come to for the away fan, as most of our lot like having a bit of crack with the opposition over a pint. You can have a drink in the ground, and maybe try one of our delicious chicken balti pies. Programmes are top quality, and can be bought at the food outlets, or outside the ground.</p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p>There are many Sunderland related fanzines published regularly, though Ready To Go is probably the only \"busy\" and active site written by the fans for the fans with a total independent view. Sites such as A Love Supreme and The FTM Executive Club, www.ftmx.co.uk offer great alternatives. The club does have an official website, www.sunderland-afc.com which has up to the date news on the team, interviews with the players, merchandise, club stats and ticket availability - even if slow to update at times.</p>",

This was a goodwill gesture to the fans for their magnificent support, home and away. Last fixture At the time of writing, it was against Leeds at the SOL, and we lost 2-0. We didn't play great, we didn't play that bad. There was the customary iffy refereeing decision at 0-0, and Leeds went straight up the other end and scored. It was disappointing to lose, especially after our fine win at Chelsea the week before. Next fixture At the time of writing, the next game is at Middlesborough. They need the points as much as we do, and it is a must win game for us if we are serious about Europe for next season. Incidentally, we don't consider Boro to be our rivals; they're just a small town in Yorkshire. [The game ended goal-less.] Will we qualify for Europe? In a word, yes. Our destiny is in our own hands. We have seven games left, all against sides below us in the league. We have a very determined and skilful bunch of players who will give their all to achieve this aim. I'm confident we will do it. Should Kevin Phillips play for England? Kevin has never been given the chances that Andy Cole has. He has not been in the sensational form of last year, but he's still scored 15 goals, despite having no pre-season due to injury. He is a quality finisher, and has a much-improved all-round game this year. He offers far more for the future than, say, Teddy Sheringham. If Eriksson picks Ted, he has to play him, especially at 34. Phillips will score goals at international level, but only if he gets a chance to! With Cole out for the next qualifier, Eriksson must have a look. Sore point One thing that irks a lot of fans is our treatment in the press. We are often made out to be some sort of northern Wimbledon, and rarely get the credit we deserve in the press. It's frankly a disgrace to insinuate that we are a hump-and-hoof-it-forward team. Yes, we do have Niall Quinn up front, and him being six foot four, it makes a degree of sense to use his aerial power! Sunderland have a side packed full of internationals, an average gate of over 47,000 at home, and always sell out their full away allocations. There's not a lot in common with Wimbledon in that lot, is there? Manager Peter Reid has done a fantastic job, turning the club round from relegation candidates in the First Division to European challengers in six years. He is a real players' manager, and his strong points are man-management and getting players to play for him. He has created a superb team spirit, and brought in some real quality players in his time at the club. He is a real stubborn bugger though, and woe betide anyone player who crosses him. He is supposedly on the verge of signing a new \u00a36m, four-year contract, which is well deserved. He now has to take the club forward into Europe, and make us serious challengers for the Premiership. The chairman Bob Murray has a dream of making Sunderland one of the biggest clubs in Europe, and is making a very good attempt at doing so. Murray was the driving force behind the Stadium of Light, and like all good chairmen, keeps out of the limelight much of the time. Whilst he is nominally in charge, it's Reid who basically runs the club. Although a native Yorkshireman, he has been a lifelong Sunderland fan, and has not forgotten his modest family roots despite being a successful multi-millionaire businessman. You can see that he has a feel for the ordinary man in the street, and he puts the priorities of these supporters well above that of the corporate \"fan\". This is a refreshing change in this day and age. Rivals Our rivals are Ne*c*stle United, and no-one else. There is a great deal of \"feeling\" between the two sets of supporters, a bit like Celtic-Rangers without the sectarianism. We have had to put up with their taunts of how superior they are, how they are a massive club (second only to Barcelona in Europe, apparently) and other such rubbish over the last ten years. The truth is that they've spent a fortune on mediocre players, owe a fortune to the banks, and have won precisely NOWT. And their ground is a lop-sided carbuncle. Kit We are in the first year of a deal with Nike, and the current kit is fairly traditional, save the all black socks. My favourite kit was the one we wore when we won the Cup in 1973, despite those floppy collars. The worst kit ever was the nasty pinstripe effort with red shorts in the days of Ally McCoist, in the early eighties. There is talk of a third strip in Internazionale colours, to compliment our all-white away kit. Most ridiculous piece of merchandise For some reason, I find the idea of \"club\" chocolates and wine a bit daft. Why should a football club want to be associated with such items? You can just imagine the reaction of your beloved lady if you presented her with a box of SAFC chocolates. You might need to pay a visit to casualty to get them removed. Mascots We originally had a black cat called Samson, and now he's got a mate called Delilah. Samson is definitely a bit of a lad. He was allegedly spotted drinking in a pub near Prenton Park a few years ago. He is very popular with the kids, and is known for taking the mickey of opposing mascots/fans. Players rated Don Hutchison is currently flavour of the month, which is no mean feat given his Geordie roots. He is surely the bargain of the season at \u00a32.5m. Phillips and Quinn have been superb over the last four years, and McCann is starting to fulfil his enormous promise. As for other teams, I really rate Steven Gerrard, and Roy Keane was absolutely outstanding against us earlier this year. Marcus Stewart has been superb this year, and has done a Phillips. It will be interesting to see what happens to him in his second season. Players hated Kevin Kilbane seems to be the target of the boo boys at the minute, which is a shame as he had a pretty good start to the season. As for other clubs, well it has to be Alan Shearer. Not only did Shearer allegedly say that he didn't like playing with Phillips for England, but he also took the rise out of the Fulwell End at the end of the last derby at Roker. Needless to say, his penalty miss in last November's derby was greeted with universal acclaim on Wearside. I think most people saw it as poetic justice. The Stadium of Light The new ground is a vast improvement on the dilapidated Roker Park. With excellent views from every seat, and much better catering facilities, supporters are well looked after. However, trying to go for a half-time 'comfort break' is never easy, or quick. There are plenty of toilets, but the planners failed to account for the thirst of the average Sunderland supporter. Atmosphere on match days The bowl of the stadium seems to help the noise generated, so the atmosphere is usually good. The big games are something special, as you can sense that the fans are really up for these games. When Phillips scored the equaliser in last year's derby, the roof nearly came off. I've never heard a noise so loud at any football match I've ever been to. What to do before the match There are numerous watering holes in Sunderland City Centre, which is only ten minutes walk from the ground. A more extensive guide can be found on the website. Sunderland is quite a good place to come to for the away fan, as most of our lot like having a bit of crack with the opposition over a pint. You can have a drink in the ground, and maybe try one of our delicious chicken balti pies. Programmes are top quality, and can be bought at the food outlets, or outside the ground. Links There are many Sunderland related fanzines published regularly, though Ready To Go is probably the only \"busy\" and active site written by the fans for the fans with a total independent view. Sites such as A Love Supreme and The FTM Executive Club, www.ftmx.co.uk offer great alternatives. The club does have an official website, www.sunderland-afc.com which has up to the date news on the team, interviews with the players, merchandise, club stats and ticket availability - even if slow to update at times.",

The accounts commission blames the shortfall on poor performance by some authorities, particularly on council tax collection, and suggests improvements that it believes could help to recoup \u00a368m. The bulk of the money is made up of council tax - local authorities could collect around \u00a352m more if every council performed as well as the best.

Latest research shows that, in the last 12 months, there was an average of more than 500 incidents for every NHS trust in the country.</p> <p>It is not just hospitals in big cities that are being turned into fortresses in the NHS. The problems of dealing with drunk and violent patients has become an ever-present symptom of the weekend in hospitals across the country. Almost every hospital is now vulnerable, and so too are the increasing number of health professionals working in the community.</p> <p>In almost all major teaching hospitals, police presence has now become routine, especially around hotspots like A&amp;E departments. NHS trusts are also employing their own security guards, hiring private companies to carry out round the clock patrols, using closed circuit TV cameras and alarms, and in some cases giving staff mobile phones and pagers purely for extra security. Staff accommodation has to be protected from intruders, and trusts have had to introduce tight security in maternity units because of the fear of baby snatching. Many hospitals are also plagued by thieves and vandals. </p> <p>One hospital trust in the South Wales valleys has become so concerned about the amount of violence taking place in and around its maternity unit that it is employing a 24-hour security guard to protect staff and expectant mothers from violent partners. The trust, which runs the Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr, currently spends around \u00a3250,000 on security</p> <p>The government wants a 20% reduction in violence against nurses and other health care staff by the end of this year as part of a zero tolerance campaign. But a spokesperson for the Department of Health said that, at present, there was no data available to confirm whether or not it was on target to meet this figure. The campaign was launched in 1999 to try to stamp out aggressive behaviour against health service staff but in fact there has been an increase in reported incidents since the campaign's start - from 419 per trust per year in 1999 to 511 in 2000.</p> <p>Trusts are aware that many incidents still go unreported and are urging staff to record all incidents in the workplace but despite the efforts, it seems unlikely that the 20% reduction target will be met.</p> <p>\"We do not expect that the government will reach their target of a 20% reduction, we think that was too optimistic, and the latest research shows that about 80% of the trusts are unlikely to meet it,\" says Jon Richards, of Unison.</p> <p>Mr Richards says it is important to target areas where problems are greatest: \"What is important is to analyse where staff are going to encounter problems. People who work in mental health, ambulance workers, A&amp;E, maternity units and in the community, are all in the frontline.</p> <p>However, he says: \"We welcome what has been done so far because it increases the profile of violence in the NHS, which is something that we have been concerned about over a long period. We need to give people as much information and training as possible so that when they encounter aggression they have the skills to help them deal with it and get out of the situation safely.\"</p> <p>The total financial cost to the NHS of dealing with violence and bad behaviour is hidden because, although individual trusts keep figures on the cost of security, hospitals do not pay for police presence, and the wider costs to the service of staff and patients who are injured are simply not recorded.</p> <p>\"There is no reliable data available that can give an overview of the levels of violence within the NHS or how much it costs as a whole, and there do need to be systems in place that supply accurate information about of all the incidents that take place. Such information does not exist, because there are no accurate recording systems,\" says Professor Betsy Stanko, director of the violence research programme at the Economic and Social Research Council in London (ESRC).</p> <p>\"What is needed is a system that makes the connection between why and how violence occurs within the health service and the way in which both staff and patients can be caught up in violent incidents. For instance, it is not surprising to find domestic violence overflowing into maternity units and then patients, staff and family members becoming involved.\"</p> <p>Research does show that nurses are most likely to be the victims of aggression with 64% of recorded incidents against them. But even when offenders are caught, they aren't necessarily dealt with severely enough, which sends out the wrong messages, say unions.</p> <p>A sentence in a case in Scotland involving a nurse, Marie Lloyd, who was punched in the face in an unprovoked attack in a Glasgow A&amp;E department, has been criticised by Unison in Scotland. The attacker, a drunken teacher, James Archer, was ordered to pay only \u00a3350 in compensation to his victim.</p>",

The problems of dealing with drunk and violent patients has become an ever-present symptom of the weekend in hospitals across the country. Almost every hospital is now vulnerable, and so too are the increasing number of health professionals working in the community. In almost all major teaching hospitals, police presence has now become routine, especially around hotspots like A&amp;E departments. NHS trusts are also employing their own security guards, hiring private companies to carry out round the clock patrols, using closed circuit TV cameras and alarms, and in some cases giving staff mobile phones and pagers purely for extra security. Staff accommodation has to be protected from intruders, and trusts have had to introduce tight security in maternity units because of the fear of baby snatching. Many hospitals are also plagued by thieves and vandals. One hospital trust in the South Wales valleys has become so concerned about the amount of violence taking place in and around its maternity unit that it is employing a 24-hour security guard to protect staff and expectant mothers from violent partners. The trust, which runs the Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr, currently spends around \u00a3250,000 on security The government wants a 20% reduction in violence against nurses and other health care staff by the end of this year as part of a zero tolerance campaign. But a spokesperson for the Department of Health said that, at present, there was no data available to confirm whether or not it was on target to meet this figure. The campaign was launched in 1999 to try to stamp out aggressive behaviour against health service staff but in fact there has been an increase in reported incidents since the campaign's start - from 419 per trust per year in 1999 to 511 in 2000. Trusts are aware that many incidents still go unreported and are urging staff to record all incidents in the workplace but despite the efforts, it seems unlikely that the 20% reduction target will be met. \"We do not expect that the government will reach their target of a 20% reduction, we think that was too optimistic, and the latest research shows that about 80% of the trusts are unlikely to meet it,\" says Jon Richards, of Unison. Mr Richards says it is important to target areas where problems are greatest: \"What is important is to analyse where staff are going to encounter problems. People who work in mental health, ambulance workers, A&amp;E, maternity units and in the community, are all in the frontline. However, he says: \"We welcome what has been done so far because it increases the profile of violence in the NHS, which is something that we have been concerned about over a long period. We need to give people as much information and training as possible so that when they encounter aggression they have the skills to help them deal with it and get out of the situation safely.\" The total financial cost to the NHS of dealing with violence and bad behaviour is hidden because, although individual trusts keep figures on the cost of security, hospitals do not pay for police presence, and the wider costs to the service of staff and patients who are injured are simply not recorded. \"There is no reliable data available that can give an overview of the levels of violence within the NHS or how much it costs as a whole, and there do need to be systems in place that supply accurate information about of all the incidents that take place. Such information does not exist, because there are no accurate recording systems,\" says Professor Betsy Stanko, director of the violence research programme at the Economic and Social Research Council in London (ESRC). \"What is needed is a system that makes the connection between why and how violence occurs within the health service and the way in which both staff and patients can be caught up in violent incidents. For instance, it is not surprising to find domestic violence overflowing into maternity units and then patients, staff and family members becoming involved.\" Research does show that nurses are most likely to be the victims of aggression with 64% of recorded incidents against them. But even when offenders are caught, they aren't necessarily dealt with severely enough, which sends out the wrong messages, say unions. A sentence in a case in Scotland involving a nurse, Marie Lloyd, who was punched in the face in an unprovoked attack in a Glasgow A&amp;E department, has been criticised by Unison in Scotland. The attacker, a drunken teacher, James Archer, was ordered to pay only \u00a3350 in compensation to his victim.",

      "bodyText": "Italian internet group Tiscali has continued its European shopping spree with the \u00a354m acquisition of a BT-owned rival. Tiscali snapped up the planet-interkom internet service provider from Viag Interkom, the German mobile phone company owned by BT. The deal, which has followed weeks of speculation, gives Tiscali fourth position in the lucrative German ISP market with 1.2m customers. Tiscali's aim is to build a European footprint, and today's deal gives it 6m active subscribers, making it the second largest on the continent behind Germany's T-Online, which has 7.9m customers. The Italian firm has been linked with almost every ISP and internet company on the market following its recent acquisitions of WorldOnline and French company LibertySurf. Tiscali is also expected to by BT's LineOne ISP, which will give it a foothold in the UK. Internet sceptics say Tiscali will not be able to realise its ambitions if it spreads itself all over Europe and fails to take a leading position in any country, but some analysts feel its independent status is a bonus. Leading ISPs such as T-Online and Wannadoo of France are owned by debt-laden national telecoms operators, which cannot afford to subsidise Tiscali-style spending sprees. Analysts therefore feel Tiscali can steal a march on its rivals by building a pan-European network and offering voice services over the internet. This will worry the telecoms companies, who will not allow their ISP subsidiaries to run voice services because it will have a severe affect on their core land-line businesses.",

      "body": "<p>Traffic was brought to a halt in Sofia last week. Windows were smashed, rubbish bins overturned and police frantically fought against crowds who were in danger of crushing each other to death as they struggled to catch a glimpse of Simeon II.</p> <p>\"It was the least we could do to welcome back our king in such a raucous fashion after an absence of over half a century,\" one radio commentator said.</p> <p>Hundreds of supporters held portraits high of the former monarch and shouted, \"we want our king!\" and \"save us Simeon\".</p> <p>King Simeon Borisov Saxe-Coburgotski II has lived in exile in a mock castle in Madrid since he was forced out by the communists in 1946. He is one of several monarchs of post-communist countries to have remained throneless after all east European royalty was swept away after the second world war.</p> <p>Yet he is about to make his mark as the first such monarch to make a comeback - but this time as a politician rather than a king.</p> <p>To huge cheers, the 64-year old Madrid-based businessman told the crowds, which included business people and intellectuals, and a television audience, that he had founded the new cross-party political grouping, the National Movement for Simeon II, which will contest the general elections on June 17.</p> <p>Simeon is not a man to take no for an answer. By seeking this new political role, the bearded monarch has defied a constitutional court ruling earlier this year that prohibits him from running for president as he has not lived in Bulgaria for long enough.</p> <p>\"Today is a turning point in my life,\" he told his supporters, fittingly at his former royal palace in Vrania. \"For decades I have lived with the duty to serve you.\"</p> <p>After ten years of painful market reforms, a slump in living standards, a drop in life expectancy, and the departure of hundreds of thousands of the country's brightest and best to western countries, most Bulgarians feel it is high time they were treated more kindly.</p> <p>The king, a victim of communism like his fellow Bulgarians, is perceived as someone who, for a change, is on their side.</p> <p>He insists his movement is not a royalist organisation, but has suggested that, if he wins in the elections, he will seek to bring about the restoration of the monarchy.</p> <p>Simeon was born in Sofia in 1937, and was crowned king on the death of his father, Boris III, in 1943 (there is a rumour that he was poisoned by agents of Hitler) at the tender age of six.

      "bodyText": "Traffic was brought to a halt in Sofia last week. Windows were smashed, rubbish bins overturned and police frantically fought against crowds who were in danger of crushing each other to death as they struggled to catch a glimpse of Simeon II. \"It was the least we could do to welcome back our king in such a raucous fashion after an absence of over half a century,\" one radio commentator said. Hundreds of supporters held portraits high of the former monarch and shouted, \"we want our king!\" and \"save us Simeon\". King Simeon Borisov Saxe-Coburgotski II has lived in exile in a mock castle in Madrid since he was forced out by the communists in 1946. He is one of several monarchs of post-communist countries to have remained throneless after all east European royalty was swept away after the second world war. Yet he is about to make his mark as the first such monarch to make a comeback - but this time as a politician rather than a king. To huge cheers, the 64-year old Madrid-based businessman told the crowds, which included business people and intellectuals, and a television audience, that he had founded the new cross-party political grouping, the National Movement for Simeon II, which will contest the general elections on June 17. Simeon is not a man to take no for an answer. By seeking this new political role, the bearded monarch has defied a constitutional court ruling earlier this year that prohibits him from running for president as he has not lived in Bulgaria for long enough. \"Today is a turning point in my life,\" he told his supporters, fittingly at his former royal palace in Vrania. \"For decades I have lived with the duty to serve you.\" After ten years of painful market reforms, a slump in living standards, a drop in life expectancy, and the departure of hundreds of thousands of the country's brightest and best to western countries, most Bulgarians feel it is high time they were treated more kindly. The king, a victim of communism like his fellow Bulgarians, is perceived as someone who, for a change, is on their side. He insists his movement is not a royalist organisation, but has suggested that, if he wins in the elections, he will seek to bring about the restoration of the monarchy. Simeon was born in Sofia in 1937, and was crowned king on the death of his father, Boris III, in 1943 (there is a rumour that he was poisoned by agents of Hitler) at the tender age of six. Just three years later the royal family was exiled after Bulgaria became a republic following a referendum. They found refuge in Egypt before Spain granted them asylum in 1951. He first came back in 1996, and two years later his dilapidated and plundered royal property was returned to him, despite resistance from old communists. In the past few years he has built up a strong following and many Bulgarians carry portraits of him in their homes. Simeon, who is married to a noble Spanish woman, speaks six languages and smokes four filter-tipped cigarillos a day, has said he is mainly motivated to step in because of the economic suffering of his fellow Bulgarians. \"By European standards, most of our people live in misery while at the same time politicians are bathing in incredible luxury,\" he says. He has stated that he will stand on an anti-corruption ticket, calling corruption the country's \"biggest enemy\". Opinion polls indicate that the king would receive 20% of the vote if an election were to be held today, and political analysts say that is growing, as people get used to the idea. There is also said to be a good chance that, after the election, the government will have the necessary two-thirds majority for a constitutional amendment to restore the monarchy. The current coalition government, led by the United Democratic Forces (the only Bulgarian government to see out a full four-year parliamentary term since communism collapsed in 1989) has slightly less support, at around 17%. Simeon has put the cat among the pigeons: a close battle between the ruling reformers and the opposition socialists (comprised mainly of ex-communists) had been predicted. Nobody had expected a long-lost king to step in. The timing displayed by Simeon, who has distant links to Queen Victoria and is Queen Elizabeth II's fourth cousin, is impeccable. His absence has increased his support and, although living standards are still low, considerable improvements have been seen over the past decade. As unlikely as it may seem, the feel-good factor is higher than it has been in years. In economic terms Bulgaria is now said to be considerably ahead of neighbouring Romania, with whom it was neck and neck in the poverty stakes for years. National morale was also given a significant boost earlier this week with the abolition of visa restrictions imposed on the Balkan state by western European countries. Meanwhile, newspapers have been hailing the fact that, for the first time since the war, Bulgarians are now free to visit the Eiffel tower and the Acropolis. The prospective return of King Simeon to public life in Bulgaria has sparked the imagination of royalists around the region. King Michael of Romania, who is now based in Switzerland, became king in 1940. Alongside Simeon he is the only other surviving east European royal to have reigned, though he was forced to abdicate following the communist takeover in 1947. He was shunned for a long time by the country's post-communist governments until three years ago, when they dispatched him as a roving ambassador to boost Romania's bid for Nato membership. Michael has remained in exile but has been invited for a visit by President Ion Illiescu later this year. Like Simeon, the 70-year old hopes to return to his throne but, although he was received with ecstasy, the feeling is that these kings would probably do the royal jobs better without their respective crowns.

An unmarried daughter has seen her last chance of a career and a life independent from the family vanish into the demands of her mother's real or feigned illness. Feigned, the daughter is sure: the crafty parental stranglehold. But then daughter and mother attend a ceremony of mourning, where a dead woman's ashes are consigned to the river. Each clasps the other's hand, the mother weeps, and the daughter thinks \"they are together still, they have the comfort of each other.\" 'Together still' means neither is dead, not that the daughter has failed to get away, and the chapter ends as the daughter \"dips her jar in the river, and lifts it high over her head. When she tilts it and pours it out, the murky water catches the blaze of the sun and flashes fire.\" The blaze of the sun is the final flaring of the daughter's anger, perhaps, the prelude to a long acceptance of an unchangeable condition.</p> <p>The context makes this settled reading untenable, though, or at least insufficient. The ceremony that daughter and mother are attending is for a woman who after many years of marriage poured kerosene over herself and set herself alight because she was so unhappy. Or in another version - the narrator reports but doesn't adjudicate - was burned alive by her in-laws. We can't see the poured water without remembering the poured kerosene which appeared only five pages back, and without wondering what to do with the two images. At the very least an act of violence has crept into the scene of calm, and the blaze of the sun looks altogether different, a reminder of the sheer intensity of the despair or hostility which can lurk in quiet days.</p> <p>All the characters here are Indian. The emotions are all in the cultural family, so to speak, and we don't need to leap to thoughts of post-colonial or subaltern repression and resistance. But since the novel is written in English, the language is itself a historical marker, a relic of empire. The characters in the novel certainly speak English (go to a convent school, drink whisky, drive a Rover, read Ella Wheeler Wilcox, although they don't each of them do all of those things), but they don't speak only English, and it's not clear when they switch languages. When the priest recites his prayers at the ceremony or tells the boatman to \"Turn back now, it's done,\" he is presumably not speaking English. When the daughter says 'Mama', I think perhaps she is. Although Desai dedicates this novel To Those Whose Stories I've Told, part of her discretion is her refusal to speak at length for her characters, to represent directly, for instance, the rage that may haunt their obedience. She speaks another language, or rather two other languages, English and the language of images.</p> <p>Desai's awareness of these languages is one answer to the question Tabish Khair puts in his intelligent and argumentative book on contemporary Indian English novels: \"how can agency be expressed and recognised when the medium of expression is not the agent's?\" This is a fine question, but it's about a sense of language rather than a linguistic fact. It's not, I think, that English doesn't belong to the Indians who speak it: why wouldn't it belong to them as much as to anyone else? Or better, does it make any sense to think of language as belonging to anyone? But assumptions of possession and dispossession are everywhere, and full of intimations of class and power. \"This language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine,\" Stephen Dedalus thinks while talking to an English priest in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The language isn't the priest's and isn't Stephen's, but the priest talks as if he owned it and Stephen feels he never will. Neither, we may wish to recall, has any other language except those he has learned in school.</p> <p>There are 16 official languages in India. Some 5 per cent of the population can read English, but mostly for vocational or technical purposes, while about 40 per cent know Hindi. I'm taking these figures both from Khair and from an article by Pankaj Mishra in the New York Review of Books. Readers and writers of English are thus a tiny minority, but Khair quotes the critic Harish Travedi as saying \"it is this tiny minority which is the privileged, prosperous, decision-making new ruling caste of the country.\" The privilege and the proportion exclude so much of what is there (although the exclusions work in different ways) that I'm not sure where this leaves non-Indian readers of Indian English fiction, except with a huge reminder of everything we don't know and perhaps can't know. We should remember, too, that much Indian fiction in English is written for readers abroad, or indeed written abroad. All three of the novelists discussed in this review live in the United States, Khair in Copenhagen.</p> <p>Khair's topic is 'aspects and effects of alienation in Indian English fiction', and he prefers \"the now unfashionable term alienation\" to more current concepts like hybridity, and says why at length. A more troublesome term might be the 'Babu' of his title, since it seems hard to shake off its pejorative tone. Khair says he is using the term descriptively, in accordance with a now accepted usage in subaltern studies - Babus \"are middle or upper class, mostly urban (at times cosmopolitan), Brahminised and/or 'westernised', and fluent in English\" - but of course a lingering flicker of the pejorative helps to say what he means by 'alienation'. 'Babu fictions' are \"literature written by a privileged section (elite) of a once-colonised people (colonial subalterns)\". The sense of this writing as \"subaltern and privileged\" is at the heart of Khair's critical project. Having mapped out the fiction, worried about questions of exile and hybridity, he turns to issues of language, city life, gender and class, before settling into detailed analyses of work by Raja Rao, RK Narayan, VS Naipaul, Salman Rushdie and Amitav Ghosh. Ghosh is Khair's anti-Rushdie (\"Rushdie continues to write with only a fractional awareness of the complexities of alienation\"), a sort of demystified, theoretically alert version of Narayan or Naipaul, particularly in the novel The Calcutta Chromosome. But then Khair has some generous things to say about Rushdie's talents, and gets a little nervous about his own enthusiasm for Ghosh. \"This concluding chapter . . . is not meant to be read as a eulogy of Ghosh and The Calcutta Chromosome,\" he says sternly. He means there's still work to be done, because \"any narration of subaltern agency may well end up as nothing more than entertainment.\" It's a risk.</p> <p>An Obedient Father is a harsh and elegant novel which is about as far from entertainment as you could get. It is set in Delhi in and around 1992, and it describes the earlier, repeated violation of a daughter by her father with grim, unloving detail, as if Humbert Humbert had been stripped of his wit and forced to make a seedy documentary. The daughter, now grown up and widowed, still lives with her father because she has nowhere else to go, and her own daughter is at risk from the father's muddy and unfocused appetites. All but three of 12 chapters are narrated by the father, one Ram Karan, and the triumph of the book is not to make this character appealing or defensible - how could it do that and why would it want to? - but to make him such an intelligent witness of his own disarray. Remembering his wife, who died a year ago, he evokes her abandonment of all care for her appearance or odour (at the age of 30 she \"stopped oiling her hair and changing her clothes regularly\", her teeth were splayed because she clenched them so tightly giving birth), and says: \"Radha became, like my children, only a reminder of all the things I had done wrong.\" Later he thinks of the sadness of his granddaughter's life as making him \"imagine a world where I had not committed my crimes\". Even here, though, he is not apologising, and not seriously penitent; he is mainly feeling sorry for himself. In this sense, he is like Humbert: he can't imagine a story of which he is not the unhappy centre.</p> <p>He has committed other crimes too. At the start of the book he is a bagman for a Mr Gupta, a civil servant in the Delhi education department whose art is to move the bribes he gets from schools into the coffers of the Congress party. The novel opens, in Ram Karan's voice, with this wonderful sentence: \"I needed to force money from Father Joseph, and it made me nervous.\" The Delhi details of the novel are profuse and precise - apartment buildings, houses, roofs, streets, surrounding countryside, buses, food, movies, rickshaws, cows, boys playing cricket, takeout from Pizza King - but the low-level gangster atmosphere resembles that of the New Jersey of Jim Jarmusch's film Ghost Dog. When Rajiv Gandhi is killed, Mr Gupta is asked to switch his loyalties to the Hindu nationalist BJP (Bharatiya Janata party), indeed to stand as one of the party's candidates for parliament, and thinks this is a good idea. This involves raising and embezzling a lot more money, and Ram Karan is soon caught up in this new project, although he thinks it is doomed. Mr Gupta's campaign does not go well, his son is killed, and he himself is murdered for stealing the Congress party's stolen money, but not before Ram Karan, in an unusual moment of astuteness, has managed to betray his boss, and protect at least his own life if not his cash. There is a grim, calculating humour in the way Ram Karan rates Mr Gupta's chances: \"I thought that if Mr Gupta was relying on me to save him, it was time to leave Mr Gupta\"; \"I had to betray Mr Gupta soon, I thought, or I would be betrayed. Here was a man who could not scare people away from killing his son. How was he going to win an election?\"</p> <p>There is something Brechtian about the bleak wit of these lines, and the same tone recurs, in a more openly comic mode, towards the end of the novel. Ram Karan is dead, and his other daughter has come to take her niece to America. Asked how the girl is doing in school, her mother says she would be top of her class \"but the father of the student who is first is a doctor and gives free medicine to the principal\". Is this conspiracy theory, parental delusion or cynical realism? When challenged, the mother says: \"It's true. This is India.\" And then the girl startles them all by saying: \"Mummy says the secret to success is working hard and cheating.\" Is this India or just what India (or any place) feels like when you're frightened and angry and poor?</p> <p>The Death of Vishnu also has a wonderful opening sentence: \"Not wanting to arouse Vishnu in case he hadn't died yet, Mrs Asrani tiptoed down to the third step above the landing on which he lived, teakettle in hand.\" After that, though, the novel settles for a comfortable, entertaining India, where lyrical visions (\"Then, thinking about the sea behind his building, the water that stretched past the horizon, the lands, the countries, the continents, that lay beyond, and above them all, the sky, with its unexplored worlds, its planets, its moons, its sun, and its endless constellations of stars, Vinod continues his homeward journey\") alternate easily with broad comedy - \"Mrs Mirchandani . . . inexpertly toppled her plate inwards, depositing cubes of cheese in her sari, some of which she only found (and ate) at home, later.\" The setting is an apartment house in Bombay, where the otherwise homeless Vishnu lives on the landing. He is dying, and does die at the novel's end, having remembered much of his life in technicolour before he goes. The implication is that this miserable human Vishnu is also a version of the mighty god Vishnu, that quite different perceptions of a person meet in the name, but the final vision of a mythological forest and a meeting with the boy god Krishna seems too bland for the effect of transcendence it is after. Vishnu's dying is placed in counterpoint with the various stories of the less homeless inhabitants of the building: the wives who nag their husbands and quarrel with each other; the Hindu girl who elopes with a Muslim boy because it will make her life like a movie; the long-grieving widower; the atheist who has begun fanatically to seek religious enlightenment. Everything is amusing and agreeable here, and the alienated agency Khair would have us look for has vanished into sentences like \"Perfumes perch along the periphery of his perception, flitting away at his approach.\"</p> <p>Ghosh's new novel, The Glass Palace, is all about subaltern agency and its presence or absence; about what it means to claim it or have it, and under what conditions the notion crumbles into incoherence. The action begins in Mandalay in 1885, as the British invade and take over Burma, exiling the last King to a lonely town on the west coast of India. A sovereign becomes a subaltern before our eyes. All he can do is worry about lost or slighted rituals and watch the ships as they enter and leave the harbour. This is how Ghosh describes the King settling into his captivity with its 'magnificent' view: \"He sat in one of the armchairs and watched the ghostly shadows of coconut palms swaying on the room's white plaster walls. In this room the hours would accumulate like grains of sand until they buried him.\"</p> <p>There is more, though. The King's captors are (mainly) English, but the British army which took his kingdom was largely Indian. Why would Indian soldiers serve in such a cause? \"Chinese peasants would never do this,\" a Malayan Chinese says - that is, \"allow themselves to be used to fight other people's wars with so little profit for themselves\". He thinks of this submission \"without protest and without conscience\" as 'evil', consciously borrowing a word from the moral language of the conqueror. \"What other term could you use to describe their willingness to kill for their masters, to follow any command, no matter what it entailed?\" And yet, the reflection continues, these soldiers also seemed innocent in their way. \"An innocent evil. I could think of nothing more dangerous.\" There is a little whiff of anachronism here, as if Adolf Eichmann had been transported back into 19th-century Burma. The comparison helps, though, because the innocence of evil is not the same as its banality. Innocence can be ended, although not without pain or damage. It can also be avoided from the start. The rather Kiplingesque Indian boy the Malayan Chinese is talking to has already survived a disease which killed off the rest of his family, and he plans to make his fortune, and he does, by first transporting Indian labour to Burma, and then buying a teak plantation with the proceeds. From the start, the Chinese sees \"no simplicity\" in the boy's face, \"no innocence: his eyes were filled with worldliness, curiosity, hunger.\" \"He was, in a way, a feral creature,\" the narrator says later. Similarly, the Chinese peasants who would not fight other people's wars are not members of any independence movement: they just don't see the point of difficult action that isn't for profit. Conversely, the very virtues one might think of in such a context - honour, loyalty, the capacity for self-sacrifice - are employed in the service of an exploitative empire, and therefore versions of subaltern illusion. This debate resounds throughout the novel.</p> <p>A wounded Indian officer fighting for the British against the Japanese in world war two suddenly has a sense of himself as a pawn in a game where he imagined he was a player.</p> <p>\"He had never experienced the slightest doubt about his personal sovereignty; never imagined himself to be dealing with anything other than the full range of human choice. But if it were true that his life had somehow been moulded by acts of power of which he was unaware - then it would follow that he had never acted of his own volition; never had a moment of true self-consciousness.\"</p> <p>A little later he asserts his volition and consciousness by going over to the Indian Independence League, an organisation designed to use the Japanese against the British, but he can't do this without facing a host of troubling questions.</p> <p>\"He knew that nothing - nothing important - was possible without loyalty, without faith. But who would claim his loyalty now? The old loyalties of India, the ancient ones - they'd been destroyed long ago; the British had built their Empire by effacing them. But the Empire was dead now - he knew this because he had felt it die within himself, where it had held its strongest dominion - and with whom was he now to keep faith?\"</p> <p>Why had the Empire died (and lived) within him? Because in happier, less self-conscious days, he and his fellow officers had seen themselves as \"the first modern Indians; the first Indians to be truly free\". \"'Look at us' - they would say - 'Punjabis, Marathas, Bengalis, Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims. Where else in India would you come across a group such as ours - where region and religion don't matter - where we can all drink together and eat beef and pork and think nothing of it?'\" This is not entirely deluded - the British brought certain liberations and modernisations to India, much as Napoleon's empire had spread them across Europe at the end of the 18th century - but it is historically blinkered, and it rests on a fallacy which Ghosh returns to again and again in this novel: the defence of the indefensible because it did some accidental good. The most lucid moment in the book is also the bleakest. The officer's rebellion against the British empire, while courageous and clear-sighted, is hopeless because he is too thoroughly the empire's creature. \"Just look at us,\" he says to a colleague. \"What are we? We've learned to dance the tango and we know how to eat roast beef with a knife and fork. The truth is that except for the colour of our skin, most people in India wouldn't even recognise us as Indians.\" And later: \"Did we ever have a hope? We rebelled against an empire that has shaped everything in our lives; coloured everything in the world as we know it. It is a huge, indelible stain which has tainted all of us. We cannot destroy it without destroying ourselves.\" His friend, a photographer and not a military man, thinks: \"this is the greatest danger, this point . . . where, in resisting the powers that form us, we allow them to gain control of all meaning; this is their moment of victory: it is in this way that they inflict their final and most terrible defeat.\" This is not the whole story, of course. There are less contaminated creatures of empire, and there are visions of independence which include the freedom to tango and eat beef. But the question here, as with the ownership or non-ownership of language, is one of consciousness, and it is hard to take the control of meaning from the enemy, even when you have got him to put down his arms or go home.</p> <p>The Glass Palace has a terrific historical sweep, from the old Raj to the contemporary United States. We learn about elephants and the management of teak forests, the rise of Indian independence movements, the growth of rubber plantations in Burma, the Asian fronts of world war two, the complicated politics of Burma/Myanmar after the war. The characters, in addition to the Chinese and Indian figures I've already mentioned, include an Indian district collector who becomes the King of Burma's keeper, the collector's wife (then widow), who travels to Europe and the United States and returns to India as a political activist; her Burmese friend, who was a palace servant in Mandalay and ends up, after marriage, children and many adventures, in a Buddhist monastery in her native country; this woman's children, one of whom is the photographer we've just seen; the widow's brother's children, one of whom is the officer I've been talking about; the son and grandchildren of the reflective Chinese man, who become owners of (and then lose) a vast rubber plantation.</p> <p>For all this book's bleak intelligence about empire and freedom, it is a deeply romantic work. I say this more in admiration than complaint, but nevertheless with some surprise. The characters have their differences, but they are courteous, understanding people, even the ruthless ones. They fall in love, they follow their hearts, and female beauty sometimes seems to be more of an engine for action than politics or empire. \"She was by far the most beautiful creature he had ever beheld, of a loveliness beyond imagining\"; as \"beautiful as a fairytale princess\"; \"perhaps the loveliest woman she'd ever set eyes on\"; \"beautiful beyond belief, beyond comprehension\"; \"she was, without a doubt, the most beautiful woman he'd ever spoken to\"; \"She was beautiful almost beyond belief.\" The first four of these quotations refer to Dolly, the Burmese palace servant who finally joins a monastery; the last two to two different women, one Indian, one Burmese. What are these creatures (and these descriptions) doing in this novel?</p> <p>Among other things they are reminding us that this work is not only romantic, it is a form of romance. Henry James says romance as a genre deals with \"experience disengaged, disembroiled, disencumbered, exempt from the conditions that we usually know to attach to it\". The implication is that the writer of such works does the disengaging, disembroiling and disencumbering from experience as we know it, while the author of novels reports faithfully on all our encumbrances. Ghosh is doing something of this with his fairytale women, but there is more to it, since all his characters have extraordinary grace, even if they don't have beauty. The implication, I think, is that history itself has its romances, that actual people do survive its horrors and defeats, or succumb to them with a dignity we wish we ourselves had. When Ghosh has one of his characters say that \"politics . . . cannot be allowed to cannibalise all of life,\" the context is Myanmar and the legacy of empire, and the point is similar to the one that the same character has already made about the 'greatest danger' and the 'final defeat'. But the survival of dignity and generosity and honour is different from mere survival, and Ghosh's characters are not so much idealised as highlighted against the darkness, creatures whose luck and kindness go hand in hand. Is this an answer to the bleakness of his political vision? It is not a political answer, and it is certainly not a solution. But it is a response to the terrible, intricate history he evokes so well, and it could perhaps be a condition of his, or anyone's, acceptance of this inheritance that we refuse the despair it so plausibly urges on us.</p> <p> \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

An unmarried daughter has seen her last chance of a career and a life independent from the family vanish into the demands of her mother's real or feigned illness. Feigned, the daughter is sure: the crafty parental stranglehold. But then daughter and mother attend a ceremony of mourning, where a dead woman's ashes are consigned to the river. Each clasps the other's hand, the mother weeps, and the daughter thinks \"they are together still, they have the comfort of each other.\" 'Together still' means neither is dead, not that the daughter has failed to get away, and the chapter ends as the daughter \"dips her jar in the river, and lifts it high over her head. When she tilts it and pours it out, the murky water catches the blaze of the sun and flashes fire.\" The blaze of the sun is the final flaring of the daughter's anger, perhaps, the prelude to a long acceptance of an unchangeable condition. The context makes this settled reading untenable, though, or at least insufficient. The ceremony that daughter and mother are attending is for a woman who after many years of marriage poured kerosene over herself and set herself alight because she was so unhappy. Or in another version - the narrator reports but doesn't adjudicate - was burned alive by her in-laws. We can't see the poured water without remembering the poured kerosene which appeared only five pages back, and without wondering what to do with the two images. At the very least an act of violence has crept into the scene of calm, and the blaze of the sun looks altogether different, a reminder of the sheer intensity of the despair or hostility which can lurk in quiet days. All the characters here are Indian. The emotions are all in the cultural family, so to speak, and we don't need to leap to thoughts of post-colonial or subaltern repression and resistance. But since the novel is written in English, the language is itself a historical marker, a relic of empire. The characters in the novel certainly speak English (go to a convent school, drink whisky, drive a Rover, read Ella Wheeler Wilcox, although they don't each of them do all of those things), but they don't speak only English, and it's not clear when they switch languages. When the priest recites his prayers at the ceremony or tells the boatman to \"Turn back now, it's done,\" he is presumably not speaking English. When the daughter says 'Mama', I think perhaps she is. Although Desai dedicates this novel To Those Whose Stories I've Told, part of her discretion is her refusal to speak at length for her characters, to represent directly, for instance, the rage that may haunt their obedience. She speaks another language, or rather two other languages, English and the language of images. Desai's awareness of these languages is one answer to the question Tabish Khair puts in his intelligent and argumentative book on contemporary Indian English novels: \"how can agency be expressed and recognised when the medium of expression is not the agent's?\" This is a fine question, but it's about a sense of language rather than a linguistic fact. It's not, I think, that English doesn't belong to the Indians who speak it: why wouldn't it belong to them as much as to anyone else? Or better, does it make any sense to think of language as belonging to anyone? But assumptions of possession and dispossession are everywhere, and full of intimations of class and power. \"This language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine,\" Stephen Dedalus thinks while talking to an English priest in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The language isn't the priest's and isn't Stephen's, but the priest talks as if he owned it and Stephen feels he never will. Neither, we may wish to recall, has any other language except those he has learned in school. There are 16 official languages in India. Some 5 per cent of the population can read English, but mostly for vocational or technical purposes, while about 40 per cent know Hindi. I'm taking these figures both from Khair and from an article by Pankaj Mishra in the New York Review of Books. Readers and writers of English are thus a tiny minority, but Khair quotes the critic Harish Travedi as saying \"it is this tiny minority which is the privileged, prosperous, decision-making new ruling caste of the country.\" The privilege and the proportion exclude so much of what is there (although the exclusions work in different ways) that I'm not sure where this leaves non-Indian readers of Indian English fiction, except with a huge reminder of everything we don't know and perhaps can't know. We should remember, too, that much Indian fiction in English is written for readers abroad, or indeed written abroad. All three of the novelists discussed in this review live in the United States, Khair in Copenhagen. Khair's topic is 'aspects and effects of alienation in Indian English fiction', and he prefers \"the now unfashionable term alienation\" to more current concepts like hybridity, and says why at length. A more troublesome term might be the 'Babu' of his title, since it seems hard to shake off its pejorative tone. Khair says he is using the term descriptively, in accordance with a now accepted usage in subaltern studies - Babus \"are middle or upper class, mostly urban (at times cosmopolitan), Brahminised and/or 'westernised', and fluent in English\" - but of course a lingering flicker of the pejorative helps to say what he means by 'alienation'. 'Babu fictions' are \"literature written by a privileged section (elite) of a once-colonised people (colonial subalterns)\". The sense of this writing as \"subaltern and privileged\" is at the heart of Khair's critical project. Having mapped out the fiction, worried about questions of exile and hybridity, he turns to issues of language, city life, gender and class, before settling into detailed analyses of work by Raja Rao, RK Narayan, VS Naipaul, Salman Rushdie and Amitav Ghosh. Ghosh is Khair's anti-Rushdie (\"Rushdie continues to write with only a fractional awareness of the complexities of alienation\"), a sort of demystified, theoretically alert version of Narayan or Naipaul, particularly in the novel The Calcutta Chromosome. But then Khair has some generous things to say about Rushdie's talents, and gets a little nervous about his own enthusiasm for Ghosh. \"This concluding chapter . . . is not meant to be read as a eulogy of Ghosh and The Calcutta Chromosome,\" he says sternly. He means there's still work to be done, because \"any narration of subaltern agency may well end up as nothing more than entertainment.\" It's a risk. An Obedient Father is a harsh and elegant novel which is about as far from entertainment as you could get. It is set in Delhi in and around 1992, and it describes the earlier, repeated violation of a daughter by her father with grim, unloving detail, as if Humbert Humbert had been stripped of his wit and forced to make a seedy documentary. The daughter, now grown up and widowed, still lives with her father because she has nowhere else to go, and her own daughter is at risk from the father's muddy and unfocused appetites. All but three of 12 chapters are narrated by the father, one Ram Karan, and the triumph of the book is not to make this character appealing or defensible - how could it do that and why would it want to? - but to make him such an intelligent witness of his own disarray. Remembering his wife, who died a year ago, he evokes her abandonment of all care for her appearance or odour (at the age of 30 she \"stopped oiling her hair and changing her clothes regularly\", her teeth were splayed because she clenched them so tightly giving birth), and says: \"Radha became, like my children, only a reminder of all the things I had done wrong.\" Later he thinks of the sadness of his granddaughter's life as making him \"imagine a world where I had not committed my crimes\". Even here, though, he is not apologising, and not seriously penitent; he is mainly feeling sorry for himself. In this sense, he is like Humbert: he can't imagine a story of which he is not the unhappy centre. He has committed other crimes too. At the start of the book he is a bagman for a Mr Gupta, a civil servant in the Delhi education department whose art is to move the bribes he gets from schools into the coffers of the Congress party. The novel opens, in Ram Karan's voice, with this wonderful sentence: \"I needed to force money from Father Joseph, and it made me nervous.\" The Delhi details of the novel are profuse and precise - apartment buildings, houses, roofs, streets, surrounding countryside, buses, food, movies, rickshaws, cows, boys playing cricket, takeout from Pizza King - but the low-level gangster atmosphere resembles that of the New Jersey of Jim Jarmusch's film Ghost Dog. When Rajiv Gandhi is killed, Mr Gupta is asked to switch his loyalties to the Hindu nationalist BJP (Bharatiya Janata party), indeed to stand as one of the party's candidates for parliament, and thinks this is a good idea. This involves raising and embezzling a lot more money, and Ram Karan is soon caught up in this new project, although he thinks it is doomed. Mr Gupta's campaign does not go well, his son is killed, and he himself is murdered for stealing the Congress party's stolen money, but not before Ram Karan, in an unusual moment of astuteness, has managed to betray his boss, and protect at least his own life if not his cash. There is a grim, calculating humour in the way Ram Karan rates Mr Gupta's chances: \"I thought that if Mr Gupta was relying on me to save him, it was time to leave Mr Gupta\"; \"I had to betray Mr Gupta soon, I thought, or I would be betrayed. Here was a man who could not scare people away from killing his son. How was he going to win an election?\" There is something Brechtian about the bleak wit of these lines, and the same tone recurs, in a more openly comic mode, towards the end of the novel. Ram Karan is dead, and his other daughter has come to take her niece to America. Asked how the girl is doing in school, her mother says she would be top of her class \"but the father of the student who is first is a doctor and gives free medicine to the principal\". Is this conspiracy theory, parental delusion or cynical realism? When challenged, the mother says: \"It's true. This is India.\" And then the girl startles them all by saying: \"Mummy says the secret to success is working hard and cheating.\" Is this India or just what India (or any place) feels like when you're frightened and angry and poor? The Death of Vishnu also has a wonderful opening sentence: \"Not wanting to arouse Vishnu in case he hadn't died yet, Mrs Asrani tiptoed down to the third step above the landing on which he lived, teakettle in hand.\" After that, though, the novel settles for a comfortable, entertaining India, where lyrical visions (\"Then, thinking about the sea behind his building, the water that stretched past the horizon, the lands, the countries, the continents, that lay beyond, and above them all, the sky, with its unexplored worlds, its planets, its moons, its sun, and its endless constellations of stars, Vinod continues his homeward journey\") alternate easily with broad comedy - \"Mrs Mirchandani . . . inexpertly toppled her plate inwards, depositing cubes of cheese in her sari, some of which she only found (and ate) at home, later.\" The setting is an apartment house in Bombay, where the otherwise homeless Vishnu lives on the landing. He is dying, and does die at the novel's end, having remembered much of his life in technicolour before he goes. The implication is that this miserable human Vishnu is also a version of the mighty god Vishnu, that quite different perceptions of a person meet in the name, but the final vision of a mythological forest and a meeting with the boy god Krishna seems too bland for the effect of transcendence it is after. Vishnu's dying is placed in counterpoint with the various stories of the less homeless inhabitants of the building: the wives who nag their husbands and quarrel with each other; the Hindu girl who elopes with a Muslim boy because it will make her life like a movie; the long-grieving widower; the atheist who has begun fanatically to seek religious enlightenment. Everything is amusing and agreeable here, and the alienated agency Khair would have us look for has vanished into sentences like \"Perfumes perch along the periphery of his perception, flitting away at his approach.\" Ghosh's new novel, The Glass Palace, is all about subaltern agency and its presence or absence; about what it means to claim it or have it, and under what conditions the notion crumbles into incoherence. The action begins in Mandalay in 1885, as the British invade and take over Burma, exiling the last King to a lonely town on the west coast of India. A sovereign becomes a subaltern before our eyes. All he can do is worry about lost or slighted rituals and watch the ships as they enter and leave the harbour. This is how Ghosh describes the King settling into his captivity with its 'magnificent' view: \"He sat in one of the armchairs and watched the ghostly shadows of coconut palms swaying on the room's white plaster walls. In this room the hours would accumulate like grains of sand until they buried him.\" There is more, though. The King's captors are (mainly) English, but the British army which took his kingdom was largely Indian. Why would Indian soldiers serve in such a cause? \"Chinese peasants would never do this,\" a Malayan Chinese says - that is, \"allow themselves to be used to fight other people's wars with so little profit for themselves\". He thinks of this submission \"without protest and without conscience\" as 'evil', consciously borrowing a word from the moral language of the conqueror. \"What other term could you use to describe their willingness to kill for their masters, to follow any command, no matter what it entailed?\" And yet, the reflection continues, these soldiers also seemed innocent in their way. \"An innocent evil. I could think of nothing more dangerous.\" There is a little whiff of anachronism here, as if Adolf Eichmann had been transported back into 19th-century Burma. The comparison helps, though, because the innocence of evil is not the same as its banality. Innocence can be ended, although not without pain or damage. It can also be avoided from the start. The rather Kiplingesque Indian boy the Malayan Chinese is talking to has already survived a disease which killed off the rest of his family, and he plans to make his fortune, and he does, by first transporting Indian labour to Burma, and then buying a teak plantation with the proceeds. From the start, the Chinese sees \"no simplicity\" in the boy's face, \"no innocence: his eyes were filled with worldliness, curiosity, hunger.\" \"He was, in a way, a feral creature,\" the narrator says later. Similarly, the Chinese peasants who would not fight other people's wars are not members of any independence movement: they just don't see the point of difficult action that isn't for profit. Conversely, the very virtues one might think of in such a context - honour, loyalty, the capacity for self-sacrifice - are employed in the service of an exploitative empire, and therefore versions of subaltern illusion. This debate resounds throughout the novel. A wounded Indian officer fighting for the British against the Japanese in world war two suddenly has a sense of himself as a pawn in a game where he imagined he was a player. \"He had never experienced the slightest doubt about his personal sovereignty; never imagined himself to be dealing with anything other than the full range of human choice. But if it were true that his life had somehow been moulded by acts of power of which he was unaware - then it would follow that he had never acted of his own volition; never had a moment of true self-consciousness.\" A little later he asserts his volition and consciousness by going over to the Indian Independence League, an organisation designed to use the Japanese against the British, but he can't do this without facing a host of troubling questions. \"He knew that nothing - nothing important - was possible without loyalty, without faith. But who would claim his loyalty now? The old loyalties of India, the ancient ones - they'd been destroyed long ago; the British had built their Empire by effacing them. But the Empire was dead now - he knew this because he had felt it die within himself, where it had held its strongest dominion - and with whom was he now to keep faith?\" Why had the Empire died (and lived) within him? Because in happier, less self-conscious days, he and his fellow officers had seen themselves as \"the first modern Indians; the first Indians to be truly free\". \"'Look at us' - they would say - 'Punjabis, Marathas, Bengalis, Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims. Where else in India would you come across a group such as ours - where region and religion don't matter - where we can all drink together and eat beef and pork and think nothing of it?'\" This is not entirely deluded - the British brought certain liberations and modernisations to India, much as Napoleon's empire had spread them across Europe at the end of the 18th century - but it is historically blinkered, and it rests on a fallacy which Ghosh returns to again and again in this novel: the defence of the indefensible because it did some accidental good. The most lucid moment in the book is also the bleakest. The officer's rebellion against the British empire, while courageous and clear-sighted, is hopeless because he is too thoroughly the empire's creature. \"Just look at us,\" he says to a colleague. \"What are we?

We rebelled against an empire that has shaped everything in our lives; coloured everything in the world as we know it. It is a huge, indelible stain which has tainted all of us. We cannot destroy it without destroying ourselves.\" His friend, a photographer and not a military man, thinks: \"this is the greatest danger, this point . . . where, in resisting the powers that form us, we allow them to gain control of all meaning; this is their moment of victory: it is in this way that they inflict their final and most terrible defeat.\" This is not the whole story, of course. There are less contaminated creatures of empire, and there are visions of independence which include the freedom to tango and eat beef. But the question here, as with the ownership or non-ownership of language, is one of consciousness, and it is hard to take the control of meaning from the enemy, even when you have got him to put down his arms or go home. The Glass Palace has a terrific historical sweep, from the old Raj to the contemporary United States. We learn about elephants and the management of teak forests, the rise of Indian independence movements, the growth of rubber plantations in Burma, the Asian fronts of world war two, the complicated politics of Burma/Myanmar after the war. The characters, in addition to the Chinese and Indian figures I've already mentioned, include an Indian district collector who becomes the King of Burma's keeper, the collector's wife (then widow), who travels to Europe and the United States and returns to India as a political activist; her Burmese friend, who was a palace servant in Mandalay and ends up, after marriage, children and many adventures, in a Buddhist monastery in her native country; this woman's children, one of whom is the photographer we've just seen; the widow's brother's children, one of whom is the officer I've been talking about; the son and grandchildren of the reflective Chinese man, who become owners of (and then lose) a vast rubber plantation. For all this book's bleak intelligence about empire and freedom, it is a deeply romantic work. I say this more in admiration than complaint, but nevertheless with some surprise. The characters have their differences, but they are courteous, understanding people, even the ruthless ones. They fall in love, they follow their hearts, and female beauty sometimes seems to be more of an engine for action than politics or empire. \"She was by far the most beautiful creature he had ever beheld, of a loveliness beyond imagining\"; as \"beautiful as a fairytale princess\"; \"perhaps the loveliest woman she'd ever set eyes on\"; \"beautiful beyond belief, beyond comprehension\"; \"she was, without a doubt, the most beautiful woman he'd ever spoken to\"; \"She was beautiful almost beyond belief.\" The first four of these quotations refer to Dolly, the Burmese palace servant who finally joins a monastery; the last two to two different women, one Indian, one Burmese. What are these creatures (and these descriptions) doing in this novel? Among other things they are reminding us that this work is not only romantic, it is a form of romance. Henry James says romance as a genre deals with \"experience disengaged, disembroiled, disencumbered, exempt from the conditions that we usually know to attach to it\".

      "bodyText": "High street retailer WH Smith has decided to sell its troublesome wholesale news distribution arm, after a year of rows with newsagents, distributors and publishers. WH Smith has been holding a strategic review of its businesses, with the distribution operation a clear favourite for the chop. The company's chief executive, Richard Handover, said the business no longer fitted into the group's strategy of building its retail and publishing operations. \"Our news distribution business, despite its excellent record of cash generation and good future prospects, is not core to this strategy and accordingly the board have decided to put this business up for sale,\" he said. Last year, WH Smith was involved in a bitter dispute with newspaper industry powerhouses such as Associated Newspapers and the Newspapers Publishers Association, who were furious with the retailer's plans to set up a new distribution system with supermarket giant Tesco. WH Smith climbed down in January this year after Associated, publisher of the Daily Mail and Evening Standard, threatened to ditch its distribution contract. Industry groups are now hoping the next owner of the distribution business, which saw its profits decline by 30% to \u00a312m, will be a less problematic partner. \"I don't know if it is good or bad news. It is an interesting development, following what happened last year,\" said Ian Locks, chief executive of the Periodical Publishers Association. \"We hope it will allow WH Smith news to refocus on the service that it provides to the industry,\" Investment firms ABN Amro Capital and CVC are tipped to make a \u00a3250m joint bid for the distribution service. WH Smith made the announcement alongside its first-half results, which recorded pre-tax profits of \u00a3100m for the six months to February this year, a fall of \u00a31m from the same period in 2000.

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office last night rallied behind Keith Vaz after the minister for Europe was criticised for political misjudgments for the fourth time this year by a cross-party committee of MPs - this time over Gibraltar. In a report on Britain's dealings with Spain over the tiny territory on the southern tip of Europe - which is not part of the EU - MPs on the foreign affairs committee condemned the Foreign Office for a lack of progress on a range of sensitive issues. They included delays on border crossing times, a shortage of telephone numbers and a lack of effective rebuttal when Spain attacked Gibraltar. Mr Vaz earned the committee's irritation by not being \"sufficiently robust\" in repudiating charges by Spain's foreign minister, Josep Pique, that Gibraltar was \"a parasite economy\" which survived on a permissive financial regime and duty free shopping. Given his trouble over allegations of personal misconduct as MP for Leicester East - still unresolved while the 44-year-old minister recovers from heart problems - Mr Vaz's friends feel it is open season on him. The same committee has already condemned him for not visiting the Balkans and for contradicting officials over the European rapid reaction force. The international development committee also felt he had not been frank over the Ilisu dam project in Turkey. Although Mr Vaz explained how he had written to Mr Pique explaining that, far from being parasitic, Gibraltar provided jobs for Spaniards, he undertook to consider a \"formal rebuttal\" - but did not. \"When pressed, Mr Vaz told us that he would re-read the speech, and if he thought that it merited any further action he would consider what to do. We are not aware of any action that has been taken by the government since Mr Vaz's re-reading of the speech,\" the MPs' report said.

      "byline": "Linda Steele",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The minister was emphatic. \"We are not proposing a takeover of social services by the NHS. We are not pursuing the so-called medical model over the social care model. The new ways of integrating NHS and social care services should be built upon a genuine partnership of equals, with each making its own distinctive contribution to what should be a single, local care network.\"</p> <p>Thus John Hutton sought to reassure his audience at a recent Guardian/National Institute for Social Work conference. It's a message he's repeated up and down the country.</p> <p>If the health minister is to be believed, why has the social care sector got the jitters? Why do many social workers feel that the values espoused by their profession are under threat?</p> <p>It's not just the old problem of social workers' poor public image (although that doesn't help). At times, the government's modernising agenda doesn't seem to leave much room for the social work contribution. A coalition of local government organisations and charities has been fighting a rearguard action against care trusts, which will provide health and social care services for adults, once the health and social care bill becomes law. While local health and social services are free to enter into partnerships, those that don't could find themselves forced into setting up a care trust.</p> <p>Leaving aside the question of whether forcing recalcitrant or underperforming authorities into \"one size fits all\" agencies will realise ministers' dreams of high quality, \"joined-up\" services, the fact that care trusts are NHS bodies has provoked concerns. Most important of these is \"a significant risk that the broadly based community and social care model will lose out to a medical/clinical approach\", according to the opposition.</p> <p>Fiona Campbell, of the Democratic Health Network at the Local Government Information Unit, explains: \"A social model of disability and care has been developed, with pressure from user groups, that doesn't see disability and old age as being equated with illness but looks at people holistically. If you're in the health service, you obviously see [service users] as patients.</p> <p>\"People may have a range of health and social care needs but they have other needs - they might go to adult education classes or the library and may need support [with] those. Good social workers will know about other services, and can look at providing a package of support which recognises older or disabled people as active citizens who aren't just patients on the receiving end of medical services.\"</p> <p>And there's the argument in a nutshell. Social work values, so the theory goes, reflect a world view in which all individuals are treated as citizens within society, with rights, and worthy of equal respect. They also promote a vision of the individual as part of a social nexus in which the effects of one's environment - including family, friends, income and housing - are crucially important to one's health and ability to have a normal everyday life. Moreover, it's not the place of the social worker to be judgmental.</p> <p>In the words of the profession's national training organisation, CCETSW: \"Social workers assist people to have control of and improve the quality of their lives, and are committed to reducing and preventing hardship and disadvantage for children, adults, families and groups [They] intervene in the lives of people whose life chances may have been adversely affected by poverty, ill health, discrimination and/or disability. </p> <p>\"In intervening in people's lives to achieve change, social workers must recognise the interrelationships of structural and individual factors in the social context in which services operate, and the need to address their impact on the lives of children and adults.\"</p> <p>Pie in the sky? Some service users might think so. And no one could pretend that all social workers abide by these golden rules.

      "bodyText": "The minister was emphatic. \"We are not proposing a takeover of social services by the NHS. We are not pursuing the so-called medical model over the social care model. The new ways of integrating NHS and social care services should be built upon a genuine partnership of equals, with each making its own distinctive contribution to what should be a single, local care network.\" Thus John Hutton sought to reassure his audience at a recent Guardian/National Institute for Social Work conference. It's a message he's repeated up and down the country. If the health minister is to be believed, why has the social care sector got the jitters? Why do many social workers feel that the values espoused by their profession are under threat? It's not just the old problem of social workers' poor public image (although that doesn't help). At times, the government's modernising agenda doesn't seem to leave much room for the social work contribution. A coalition of local government organisations and charities has been fighting a rearguard action against care trusts, which will provide health and social care services for adults, once the health and social care bill becomes law. While local health and social services are free to enter into partnerships, those that don't could find themselves forced into setting up a care trust. Leaving aside the question of whether forcing recalcitrant or underperforming authorities into \"one size fits all\" agencies will realise ministers' dreams of high quality, \"joined-up\" services, the fact that care trusts are NHS bodies has provoked concerns. Most important of these is \"a significant risk that the broadly based community and social care model will lose out to a medical/clinical approach\", according to the opposition. Fiona Campbell, of the Democratic Health Network at the Local Government Information Unit, explains: \"A social model of disability and care has been developed, with pressure from user groups, that doesn't see disability and old age as being equated with illness but looks at people holistically. If you're in the health service, you obviously see [service users] as patients. \"People may have a range of health and social care needs but they have other needs - they might go to adult education classes or the library and may need support [with] those. Good social workers will know about other services, and can look at providing a package of support which recognises older or disabled people as active citizens who aren't just patients on the receiving end of medical services.\" And there's the argument in a nutshell. Social work values, so the theory goes, reflect a world view in which all individuals are treated as citizens within society, with rights, and worthy of equal respect. They also promote a vision of the individual as part of a social nexus in which the effects of one's environment - including family, friends, income and housing - are crucially important to one's health and ability to have a normal everyday life. Moreover, it's not the place of the social worker to be judgmental. In the words of the profession's national training organisation, CCETSW: \"Social workers assist people to have control of and improve the quality of their lives, and are committed to reducing and preventing hardship and disadvantage for children, adults, families and groups [They] intervene in the lives of people whose life chances may have been adversely affected by poverty, ill health, discrimination and/or disability. \"In intervening in people's lives to achieve change, social workers must recognise the interrelationships of structural and individual factors in the social context in which services operate, and the need to address their impact on the lives of children and adults.\" Pie in the sky? Some service users might think so. And no one could pretend that all social workers abide by these golden rules. But, while not every doctor or nurse sees only a walking disease to be cured as opposed to a whole person, differences in organisational structures, training and a body of knowledge and professional ethos can and do affect the way that service users are treated. Mental health is one key area. Government proposals could mean that the agreement of an approved social worker (ASW) to someone being detained under the Mental Health Act in England and Wales will no longer be required.

Yesterday, she sat surrounded by her eight children atop the pitiful belongings she had managed to salvage from the rubble of her home: a sack of flour, and one of rice, a hand-operated sewing machine, a bouquet of plastic flowers and a colouring book.</p> <p>Her home was one of 30 systematically flattened by Israeli tanks and bulldozers in the first invasion of Palestinian territory since the start of a seven-month uprising. Two people were killed in the operation, which began shortly after midnight when four tanks rolled into the thickly populated refugee camp in the south of the Gaza strip. As helicopter gunships buzzed overhead and tanks shelled two blocks of flats nearby, bulldozers set about destroying a swath of civilian homes.</p> <p>The Israeli defence minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, said the raid was in response to mortar fire. \"These are points we don't want the Palestinians to return to. This is a clear act of defence.\"</p> <p>The attack was launched only hours after the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon - known as the \"Bulldozer\" for his personal predilection for razing Palestinian homes when he was military commander in the Gaza Strip in the early 1970s - announced that he had a plan for dealing with the revolt against Israel's occupation.</p> <p>Even by the standards of the last seven months, which have seen the Israeli army uproot thousands of olive trees and raze vast tracts of farm land in Gaza, the early morning assault on this refugee camp set a new extreme, Peter Hansen, the commissioner of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said.</p> <p>He said the demolition of more than 32 shelters - housing by conservative estimates some 400 people - was the worst single act of destruction visited on the Palestinians since they began their revolt against Israel's occupation last September. It also marks Israel's first invasion of Palestinian territory since 1994, when Khan Yunis, like 60% of the Gaza Strip, came under the rule of Yasser Arafat's administration as part of the Oslo peace accords.</p> <p>All residents in the camp are refugees or the descendants of those who fled their homes when the Jewish state was created in 1948.

      "bodyText": "The army called it \"Operation Enjoyable Song\". There was no warning. \"It happened all of a sudden, in the middle of the night when we were all sleeping,\" said Soraya Abu Loz. Her family has lived in Khan Yunis refugee camp since arriving as refugees from the Israeli town of Beer Sheva in 1948. Yesterday, she sat surrounded by her eight children atop the pitiful belongings she had managed to salvage from the rubble of her home: a sack of flour, and one of rice, a hand-operated sewing machine, a bouquet of plastic flowers and a colouring book. Her home was one of 30 systematically flattened by Israeli tanks and bulldozers in the first invasion of Palestinian territory since the start of a seven-month uprising. Two people were killed in the operation, which began shortly after midnight when four tanks rolled into the thickly populated refugee camp in the south of the Gaza strip. As helicopter gunships buzzed overhead and tanks shelled two blocks of flats nearby, bulldozers set about destroying a swath of civilian homes. The Israeli defence minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, said the raid was in response to mortar fire. \"These are points we don't want the Palestinians to return to. This is a clear act of defence.\" The attack was launched only hours after the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon - known as the \"Bulldozer\" for his personal predilection for razing Palestinian homes when he was military commander in the Gaza Strip in the early 1970s - announced that he had a plan for dealing with the revolt against Israel's occupation. Even by the standards of the last seven months, which have seen the Israeli army uproot thousands of olive trees and raze vast tracts of farm land in Gaza, the early morning assault on this refugee camp set a new extreme, Peter Hansen, the commissioner of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said. He said the demolition of more than 32 shelters - housing by conservative estimates some 400 people - was the worst single act of destruction visited on the Palestinians since they began their revolt against Israel's occupation last September. It also marks Israel's first invasion of Palestinian territory since 1994, when Khan Yunis, like 60% of the Gaza Strip, came under the rule of Yasser Arafat's administration as part of the Oslo peace accords. All residents in the camp are refugees or the descendants of those who fled their homes when the Jewish state was created in 1948. Overnight, 56 families were homeless again. \"This is a pretty bad message, and it is something that looks extremely deliberate,\" Mr Hansen said. He said the UN agency would lodge an official complaint with the Israeli government. The French foreign ministry delivered its own rebuke yesterday, saying the army assault was fuelling a \"downward spiral\". The Israeli army's seven-hour attack on Khan Yunis, whose low, asbestos-roofed houses are home to some 60,000 refugees, was launched after Mr Sharon's visit to army bases in Gaza for what was reported in the Israeli press as a bristly encounter with senior military commanders. Mr Sharon is reported to have upbraided his commanders for including political content in their briefings. Referring to his own command in Gaza, he said: \"In my time, there were no such terms. We spoke less and focused on action.\" But he also gave a hint of what was to come in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli army has been confronting a new threat from Palestinian militias firing mortars on illegal Jewish settlements inside the territory, and on a nearby kibbutz which lies within the borders of the Jewish state. \"We know exactly what to do. I have a very clear plan and it will be implemented,\" Mr Sharon was quoted as saying. During the election campaign, Mr Sharon's advisers said he supported moving Israel's army into Palestinian-ruled territory - a course the former prime minister, Ehud Barak, had rejected as a violation of the peace accords. Khan Yunis was perhaps the most likely place for Israel's first invasion of Palestinian terrain. The western edge of Khan Yunis has emerged as one of the fiercest battle arenas of the uprising. An Israeli army base hugs the camp on three sides like a horseshoe, with sandbags and gun placements protecting the illegal Jewish settlement of Neve Dekalim. In the relentless exchanges of fire between soldiers and Palestinian militias, some of the refugee houses have taken so many bullets they look like they have caught a rash. But the Israeli army says Palestinian fighters have fired more than 70 mortars on Jewish settlements and army bases since February 24. Although Israeli intelligence officials say the Palestinians appear to be using homemade launchers, they say the move towards higher calibre arms is a dangerous escalation in the uprising. Israeli military officials fear it is only a matter of time before the Palestinians inflict heavy casualties. Amid increasing international concerns that the mortar war in Gaza, and yesterday's invasion of Khan Yunis, will fuel a further escalation of violence, security officials were expected to meet last night at the Tel Aviv home of the American ambassador to Israel.

      "bodyText": "Tina Weaver, the new editor of the Sunday Mirror, has tabloid instincts that Richard Desmond would kill for. Deputy to Piers Morgan since 1998, Ms Weaver has combined a passion for \"feminine\" human interest stories with a hard news instinct. It was she who broke what the Mirror believed was its best scoop of 1999 - that Tony and Cherie Blair were expecting their fourth child. Headlined \"Scoop of the year: Blairs' Babe: They are utterly and completely Gobsmacked\", the story was written by the deputy editor herself. Although many argued Matthew Wright's expose of hoaxers on the Vanessa Feltz show was a better story, Cherie's baby got the attention of the establishment and the Mirror's rivals. Ms Weaver's came to the public eye with her scoop revelation on Today that Michael Jackson's marriage to Lisa Marie Presley was a sham, a story that won her the reporter of the year award in the British Press Awards in 1994. Ms Weaver, who joined the Mirror in 1995, has gravitated towards the feminine, with heart-rending interviews with the family of Sarah Payne and Helen Rollason a staple of her work. Eyebrows were raised recently by her decision to splash on an exclusive interview with Coronation Street star Helen Worth. She made the media gossip pages when, while editing a reader Q&amp;A with Tony Blair, she substituted questions about the state of the health service for \"Do you mind losing your hair?\" and \"Who does the cooking at Number 10?\". And mischievous gossips recall the time she went with editor Piers Morgan to visit Tony Blair clad in a tiny mini-skirt. But she has won plaudits for her launch and editorship of the Mirror's Saturday magazine M, which is widely thought to be a slick, aspirational magazine with more of an edge than some of the glossies it copied. Sources say her combination of good people skills and toughness make her ideal for the Sunday Mirror. Now, with the editors of the two highest-selling Sunday tabloids both female, pundits are immediately focusing on the battle of the bimbos. Ms Weaver is likely to be searching even now for a campaign to grab headlines like Ms Wade's paedophile \"name and shame\" campaign on the News of the World. And staff at M will be lamenting the loss of their leader.

They work by trawling through information from the records of millions of people. It is epidemiologists who assess the dangers of the contraceptive pill, whether ethnic minorities have equal access to health care and whether electricity pylons cause leukaemia. It is they who work out which treatment is best for breast cancer - and whether your GP might be quietly murdering old ladies in their homes. </p> <p>Because they work with whole populations, epidemiologists can see what is dangerous and what isn't, whether particular illnesses are becoming more or less common, what treatment works and what doesn't, and - in the case of surgeons - who is dangerous and who isn't. Epidemiology has helped save more lives than any of the other more glamorous branches of medicine. </p> <p>Every time a doctor advises you about your health or decides how best to treat you, he or she is using the evidence provided by epidemiologists. Universal clean water and sewage facilities, and advising people not to smoke, were among their most famous ideas. </p> <p>But all of this may have to come to an end. The General Medical Council (GMC) has decided that this kind of purely observational work is an infringement of patients' rights - even though it reveals nobody's identity and does nothing to alter or withold anyone's treatment. </p> <p>The GMC has declared that each study should go ahead only with every patients' expressed and informed consent, and that doctors should not provide data about their patients to any other doctors without that consent. It's a nice idea: patient autonomy and patient confidentiality are crucial, and it would be wrong to dismiss them out of hand. But because such consent is often unworkable - for a host of practical and scientific reasons - the change might stop epidemiology and clinical audit in their tracks and severely impede further advances in medicine. </p> <p>Ironically, epidemiologists and other doctors who use records purely for research and statistical purposes are the people in medicine who have taken confidentiality and data encryption most seriously. Anyone worried about the confidentiality of material relating to their health should be more concerned about the underpaid temporary staff working on the front desk of their local GP surgery than about a group of medical statisticians cooing over a meta-analysis of 50,000 cases of cancer. There are no scandals in epidemiology. </p> <p>The problem is that the data being shared must, at some stage, include the identity of the patient. Looking at how our world-renowned national net work of cancer registries works, you can see why. For decades, 11 cancer research centres around the country have collected morsels of data on patients afflicted with cancer in their region. From the type of cancer to how they were treated, from the details of their laboratory investigations to their death certificate, all the information is collated, stored and analysed in order to improve the care of the next generation of patients. </p> <p>There is a good reason that it is not possible for this information to be filed entirely anonymously, without identification of the patients attached. The cancer registry system collates data from innumerable diverse and unrelated bodies: the registrar of deaths in the town hall, the GP, the hospital pathologist. And the patient's identity is the only thing that unifies these disparate pieces of information, allowing the registry to match up tissue diagnosis with symptoms with death certificate and trace the life of one person's cancer. </p> <p>But it is not as if the information is being broadcast on the nine o'clock news. This is the confidential transfer of information between doctors, which is then held with obsessive security, with the doctors being accountable to the GMC if they treat the information irresponsibly. </p> <p>It is the most comprehensive national cancer database ever constructed and is the envy of the world. Every doctor in the country is expected to file data to the cancer registries on their patients. But the GMC has given a deadline of October 2001 for the cancer registries to put mechanisms in place for seeking and recording the consent of everyone on their books. Without this consent, doctors will have to stop the flow of information to them. Because this is impractical, cancer registries may have to close. </p> <p>But if the GMC wants us to, why can't we just ask people for consent? Can it really be so difficult? In some circumstances it may be, and not just for practical reasons. Insisting on consent can systematically skew the data, and give answers that are weaker, or simply wrong. </p> <p>If you ask people to agree to having their data used in an observational study, some will refuse. That, of course, is the reason you are asking them in the first place. And when they refuse, particularly if certain types of people are consistently more likely to refuse, such as the demented, the psychotic, the homeless, or those embarrassed by their health problems, that skews your data. </p> <p>This is what medical statisticians call \"consent bias\". It is important because it can turn your data on its head, render it useless and give the wrong conclusions. In medicine, that costs lives. </p> <p>There are unscalable practical barriers to seeking consent from the whole population. It remains a Herculean task even if, instead of considering specific cases with patients, we assume that we only want to ask everyone in the country the rather uninformative and vacuous question: \"Do you consent to your data being shared, on a confidential basis, for anything we can think of?\" There are 60 milion of us, after all. </p> <p>How quickly can you get informed consent, and explain why you want it? Will three minutes tacked on to the first consultation with a GP be enough? A tick-box? Who will keep a central record? What about the patient with Alzheimer's who can't give consent? What if you change your mind? What if you switch GPs? What if you never go to a GP, but just pitch up in A&amp;E one day? It is a far bigger undertaking than the census, and it is hard to imagine it ever happening. </p> <p>It would be far easier to legislate to protect the work of cancer registries and other organisations concerned with epidemiology and health services research, to ensure that the confidential data they need could never be used for non-medical purposes. That would protect the public and promote new medical knowledge. </p> <p>As a doctor, I don't expect patients just to tolerate the kind of work that the cancer registries and epidemiologists do: I believe they would be astonished if it weren't done. Epidemiology is the foundation on which all preventative medicine is based. Without it, much would be just anecdote and small drug trials. This move to tie its legs together can only be motivated by some unthinking adherence to an abstract philosophical doctrine about privacy. The point of the principle of confidentiality was to protect the patient from untoward disclosure of information which could be used to his or her detriment. It should not be a moral absolute, at so great a cost. </p> <p>Is our adherence to principles about privacy so important that we would sagely shave months or years off our life expectancies? I'd rather have another birthday, thanks.</p>",

And when they refuse, particularly if certain types of people are consistently more likely to refuse, such as the demented, the psychotic, the homeless, or those embarrassed by their health problems, that skews your data. This is what medical statisticians call \"consent bias\". It is important because it can turn your data on its head, render it useless and give the wrong conclusions. In medicine, that costs lives. There are unscalable practical barriers to seeking consent from the whole population. It remains a Herculean task even if, instead of considering specific cases with patients, we assume that we only want to ask everyone in the country the rather uninformative and vacuous question: \"Do you consent to your data being shared, on a confidential basis, for anything we can think of?\" There are 60 milion of us, after all. How quickly can you get informed consent, and explain why you want it? Will three minutes tacked on to the first consultation with a GP be enough? A tick-box? Who will keep a central record? What about the patient with Alzheimer's who can't give consent? What if you change your mind? What if you switch GPs? What if you never go to a GP, but just pitch up in A&amp;E one day? It is a far bigger undertaking than the census, and it is hard to imagine it ever happening. It would be far easier to legislate to protect the work of cancer registries and other organisations concerned with epidemiology and health services research, to ensure that the confidential data they need could never be used for non-medical purposes. That would protect the public and promote new medical knowledge. As a doctor, I don't expect patients just to tolerate the kind of work that the cancer registries and epidemiologists do: I believe they would be astonished if it weren't done. Epidemiology is the foundation on which all preventative medicine is based. Without it, much would be just anecdote and small drug trials. This move to tie its legs together can only be motivated by some unthinking adherence to an abstract philosophical doctrine about privacy. The point of the principle of confidentiality was to protect the patient from untoward disclosure of information which could be used to his or her detriment. It should not be a moral absolute, at so great a cost. Is our adherence to principles about privacy so important that we would sagely shave months or years off our life expectancies? I'd rather have another birthday, thanks.",

For this reason: Shakespeare wrote the tetralogies in reverse historical sequence. The first (the three Henry VI plays and Richard III), was composed between 1588 and the early 1590s.

If nothing else, it will get those seldom- performed Henry VI plays on the stage, to full houses. But audiences investing so much time and money should do a little homework. They should check out where the different plays come in Shakespeare's writing career, so as to make the necessary aesthetic adjustments. </p> <p>The best preparation is to buy John Julius Norwich's 1999 book Shakespeare's Kings. Norwich recalls being taken by his parents, as a 15-year-old in the mid-1940s, to see the two parts of Henry IV in consecutive matinee performance, starring Ralph Richardson as Falstaff and Olivier as Hotspur. His interest in the long expanses of Shakespeare's history was sharpened by the Barton-Hall compilation, The Wars of the Roses, which he sat through from beginning to end, 20 years later. </p> <p>As a historian, Norwich cannot but point out the woeful inaccuracies.

His interest in the long expanses of Shakespeare's history was sharpened by the Barton-Hall compilation, The Wars of the Roses, which he sat through from beginning to end, 20 years later. As a historian, Norwich cannot but point out the woeful inaccuracies. But, as he reminds us: \"Shakespeare was not a historian; he was a dramatist. The play was the thing.\" Make that plays - all eight of them. \u0095 Shakespeare's Kings, by John Julius Norwich, is published by Penguin, price \u00a39.99. To book tickets for the RSC's history plays, call the box office on (020-7638 8891).",

The deal is a coup for the fledgling companies, which normally play second fiddle to their bigger rival BSkyB. The toga epic, which was directed by British film-maker Ridley Scott, will be available on PPV from Monday April 23. Gladiator is being offered by u&gt;direct via the Sky Digital satellite platform, and by Front Row to NTL's and Telewest's 3.6m analogue and digital cable subscribers. BSkyB's own in-house PPV operation, Sky Box Office, is thought to have missed out on the UK TV premiere of Gladiator. u&gt;direct came in for criticism after football fans experienced difficulties trying to subscribe to the England v Finland World Cup qualifier last autumn. Gladiator last month picked up five Oscars - more than any other movie - at the 2001 awards ceremony, including best picture and best actor for Russell Crowe. Both u&gt;direct and Front Row have picked up the film through a deal with Hollywood studio Universal. Channel 5 is expected to pick up the UK terrestrial premiere of Gladiator in a ground-breaking joint deal with Channel 4.",

      "body": "<p>Whatever other criticism can be levelled against Sinn Fein, few would accuse the party of failing to see the big picture. On the contrary, as our front-page account today suggests, they are congenital gazers into the future, forever shaping a long-term strategy - and a strategy for the period after that.</p> <p>Some of it may sound like fantasy politics, wishful thinking and dreamy scenarios, but it is useful both as a window into the republican mindset and as an analysis of a situation which could be about to change dramatically.</p> <p>Sinn Fein believes, with a breathtaking confidence, that it is now in a \"countdown scenario\" toward its historic goal of a united Ireland. The starting point for its optimism comes on April 29 with the first population census since 1991 - and only the second for which republicans have urged cooperation rather than boycott. They believe the new data will show Catholics at about 46% of the total Northern Irish population, a five point upward leap from the last survey. If that pattern holds, says Sinn Fein, Catholics will no longer be a beleaguered minority in the province: they will form its majority.</p> <p>This puts a spring in the republican step, feeling what Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin calls \"a sense of destiny\". They need only sit it out; time and the Catholic birth rate will eventually deliver them to the promised land. Unionists may be \"in denial\" about the coming reality but, says Sinn Fein, republicans and nationalists know history is on their side.</p> <p>Accordingly, the party envisages a \"border poll\" - a referendum asking Northern Ireland's people whether they wish to live in the United Kingdom or a united Ireland - the first since 1973, which yielded no meaningful result because of a nationalist boycott. Mr McLaughlin wants such a poll within the next couple of years. He knows his side will lose, but it will show their strength. Then, in the next 10 years, he wants another one. Eventually, his side will have the numbers and it will win.</p> <p>To add to his breezy confidence, there is the changing face of nationalist politics. Sinn Fein might well emerge as Northern Ireland's biggest party, in terms of votes cast, at the next election. They are breathing down the neck of the Social Democratic and Labour party, casting themselves now as the energetic, authentic voice of nationalism/republicanism. The SDLP's leadership is ageing, with no large figure to compete with John Hume or Seamus Mallon.</p> <p>Sinn Fein remains equally dominated by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, but those men are younger - and their ranks are being reinforced by politicians who, unlike them, have no background in paramilitary activity. If they do not overtake the SDLP this time, they reckon they will at the next.</p> <p>What blots this sunny horizon? You might think the change within unionism would alarm republicans a bit. The Ulster Unionist party could take a pasting at the election, surpassed by Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party; even within the UUP, those who support the Good Friday agreement could lose out to those who say no. David Trimble may well be ousted, leaving Sinn Fein to deal with a naysayer like Jeffrey Donaldson. Surely that would trouble Sinn Fein?</p> <p>Not a bit of it. If unionism walks away from the agreement, republicans have a plan B and C. They would either demand the renegotiation of the accord - allowing pro-agreement forces, unionist and nationalist, to run the executive together in their own coalition, leaving Messrs Paisley and Donaldson in opposition - or they would push for London and Dublin to impose joint rule. That would suit Sinn Fein just fine. The British and Irish governments could well proceed with the reforms, on policing and demilitarisation, which republicans want - and, as an added bonus, unionists would be scared back to the negotiating table by the prospect of rule from Dublin.</p> <p>They have it all mapped out. Unfortunately some facts get in the way. The census will indeed show an uptick for the Catholic population, but it may well reveal a peak which has passed. Demographers say that, while the Catholic presence in secondary schools is above 50%, it falls below that figure at primary level. In other words, the future will still see a narrow Protestant majority.</p> <p>Add to that a dose of political reality. No British government is about to allow anything as divisive as a border poll: it is not going to happen. Calling for the renegotiation of the Good Friday agreement is all very well, too: but who are republicans going to renegotiate with? They have found it hard enough with Mr Trimble: surely they do not think they will have an easier time with Mr Donaldson. Lastly, the Sinn Fein analysis misses out the problems of their own backyard. The rejectionists of the Real IRA are winning recruits by branding Sinn Fein as sellouts. If the republicans' partners in the peace process - the UUP - walk away, that will make the rejectionist case, that the peace effort was always doomed, all the more credible.</p> <p>For all that, there is a larger truth that Sinn Fein do appear to have glimpsed.

      "bodyText": "Whatever other criticism can be levelled against Sinn Fein, few would accuse the party of failing to see the big picture. On the contrary, as our front-page account today suggests, they are congenital gazers into the future, forever shaping a long-term strategy - and a strategy for the period after that. Some of it may sound like fantasy politics, wishful thinking and dreamy scenarios, but it is useful both as a window into the republican mindset and as an analysis of a situation which could be about to change dramatically. Sinn Fein believes, with a breathtaking confidence, that it is now in a \"countdown scenario\" toward its historic goal of a united Ireland. The starting point for its optimism comes on April 29 with the first population census since 1991 - and only the second for which republicans have urged cooperation rather than boycott. They believe the new data will show Catholics at about 46% of the total Northern Irish population, a five point upward leap from the last survey. If that pattern holds, says Sinn Fein, Catholics will no longer be a beleaguered minority in the province: they will form its majority. This puts a spring in the republican step, feeling what Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin calls \"a sense of destiny\". They need only sit it out; time and the Catholic birth rate will eventually deliver them to the promised land. Unionists may be \"in denial\" about the coming reality but, says Sinn Fein, republicans and nationalists know history is on their side. Accordingly, the party envisages a \"border poll\" - a referendum asking Northern Ireland's people whether they wish to live in the United Kingdom or a united Ireland - the first since 1973, which yielded no meaningful result because of a nationalist boycott. Mr McLaughlin wants such a poll within the next couple of years. He knows his side will lose, but it will show their strength. Then, in the next 10 years, he wants another one. Eventually, his side will have the numbers and it will win. To add to his breezy confidence, there is the changing face of nationalist politics. Sinn Fein might well emerge as Northern Ireland's biggest party, in terms of votes cast, at the next election. They are breathing down the neck of the Social Democratic and Labour party, casting themselves now as the energetic, authentic voice of nationalism/republicanism. The SDLP's leadership is ageing, with no large figure to compete with John Hume or Seamus Mallon. Sinn Fein remains equally dominated by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, but those men are younger - and their ranks are being reinforced by politicians who, unlike them, have no background in paramilitary activity. If they do not overtake the SDLP this time, they reckon they will at the next. What blots this sunny horizon? You might think the change within unionism would alarm republicans a bit. The Ulster Unionist party could take a pasting at the election, surpassed by Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party; even within the UUP, those who support the Good Friday agreement could lose out to those who say no. David Trimble may well be ousted, leaving Sinn Fein to deal with a naysayer like Jeffrey Donaldson. Surely that would trouble Sinn Fein? Not a bit of it. If unionism walks away from the agreement, republicans have a plan B and C. They would either demand the renegotiation of the accord - allowing pro-agreement forces, unionist and nationalist, to run the executive together in their own coalition, leaving Messrs Paisley and Donaldson in opposition - or they would push for London and Dublin to impose joint rule. That would suit Sinn Fein just fine. The British and Irish governments could well proceed with the reforms, on policing and demilitarisation, which republicans want - and, as an added bonus, unionists would be scared back to the negotiating table by the prospect of rule from Dublin. They have it all mapped out. Unfortunately some facts get in the way. The census will indeed show an uptick for the Catholic population, but it may well reveal a peak which has passed. Demographers say that, while the Catholic presence in secondary schools is above 50%, it falls below that figure at primary level. In other words, the future will still see a narrow Protestant majority. Add to that a dose of political reality. No British government is about to allow anything as divisive as a border poll: it is not going to happen. Calling for the renegotiation of the Good Friday agreement is all very well, too: but who are republicans going to renegotiate with? They have found it hard enough with Mr Trimble: surely they do not think they will have an easier time with Mr Donaldson. Lastly, the Sinn Fein analysis misses out the problems of their own backyard. The rejectionists of the Real IRA are winning recruits by branding Sinn Fein as sellouts. If the republicans' partners in the peace process - the UUP - walk away, that will make the rejectionist case, that the peace effort was always doomed, all the more credible. For all that, there is a larger truth that Sinn Fein do appear to have glimpsed. While unionism shifts from its lukewarm yes to a more robust no, it ignores the emerging reality of Northern Ireland. The country is changing, heading to a point where, even if Catholics are not in the majority, the land can only be governed by both traditions working together. The old days of unionist domination are over. The choice for unionists now is not to ignore that trend or wish it were otherwise - but adapt to it, before it sweeps them away.",

There will be time enough to assess the government's record, but I'm already visited by deeper-throated thoughts that suit the confessional season. On the brink of our age-old ceremony of democratic transition, I find it hard to engage at a fitting level with the awesome political climax the election is supposed to produce.

Gazing up at Big Ben these past few years, I've begun to see it more as the icon of a theme park than the tower of democracy. It's a huge, magnificent sight, none more elemental in the entire democratic world, especially at night. But what goes on inside? Is that where power in Britain actually resides? How much are the sacred processes - the winding-up and then the rebirth - now symbol, and how much reality?</p> <p>We know the bottom line. The very presence of these 659 MPs is a massive, immovable guarantee against dictatorship. Because they're there, certain horrors will never happen. Their existence, like the election that will produce the next batch, distinguishes countries such as Britain from great tracts of Africa and Asia, on to which the Mother of Parliaments somehow failed in the last century to graft a permanent culture of functioning democracy. We need elections to be open and uncorrupt, and must hope they engage the maximum number of citizens in voting. This is a system worth defending.</p> <p>But what was once the parliament of an empire is now not the parliament of even a single nation. Perhaps 80% of the government decisions that affect Scotland are no longer made under these ancient rafters. The setting-up of the Scottish parliament means that 72 MPs at Westminster are not responsible for much of public life as it touches their constituents. Welsh devolution, though less drastic, also drains power away. Thus, two tranches of MPs, 112 in all, will return as impostors - only partially connected to the mandate of legitimacy, they need to justify the influence they hope to command.

The power of corporations, and the speed at which trillions of dollars are moved round global markets, sharply confine any big-picture agenda MPs may expect to control.</p> <p>So does the encroaching writ of the European Union. A decade ago, Jacques Delors famously declared that before long 80% of the social and economic laws affecting Europe would be decided in Brussels. It never came to that, and now the tendency is to try to move the other way. But Europe is a mighty force for the rearrangement of sovereignty. European verities add to the feeling that the sound and fury we're about to witness is, in part, a charade. Still doing one's best to be impressed by the neo-Gothic palace beside the Thames, all one remembers, unfortunately, is the idleness and lack of tenacity with which Westminster handles its existing right to invigilate what Brussels commands.</p> <p>Parliament remains, of course, sovereign. It has the power to overturn devolution, cancel the Treaty of Rome, and pass statutes containing solemn words that purport to undo the laws of global economics. It could re-declare itself the potent centre of what it means to be British: a private member, eaten by Euro-scepticism, is doubtless at work on a text. The more telling point is that most of the disablement has been at the hands of parliament itself. MPs willingly passed the laws - on Scotland, on Europe - that decimated their own importance. They responded, for very good reason, to imperatives that sent some power down to regions and some up to Europe. They now have to live with the consequences, beside which Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster look more like a protective facade than a fortress of democracy.</p> <p>Many MPs make the best of this. Invited by the Guardian to name what they were proudest of doing in the past four years, a lot of them had answers you could admire.

      "bodyText": "Seats that could change hands West Tyrone (N) Willie Thompson, the anti-agreement Ulster Unionist MP, is likely to lose to nationalists. Brid Rodgers, SDLP candidate and Northern Ireland agriculture minister, is thought to be ahead of Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein vice-president North Belfast (U) Cecil Walker, the pro-agreement UUP MP, is vulnerable to a challenge from Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionists and Alban Maginness of the SDLP. East Derry (U) Willie Ross, the anti agreement UUP MP, could be vulnerable to a challenge from Gregory Campbell, a DUP minister in the Northern Ireland executive. The DUP, which came second in 1997, topped the poll in the seat's assembly election. Fermanagh and South Tyrone (U) This seat, won by hunger striker Bobby Sands in a 1981 byelection, is a four way contest. James Cooper, the pro-agreement UUP candidate, who is replacing retiring MP Ken Maginnis, will be vulnerable to a challenge from the DUP or independent anti-agreement unionist Jim Dixon. Split unionist vote could help Sinn Fein, whose two candidates won the highest number of votes in the assembly elections, or the SDLP, whose sole candidate came top. Strangford (U) Iris Robinson, wife of DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson, is a frontrunner for this seat, currently held by retiring UUP deputy leader John Taylor. But David McNarry, the pro agreement UUP candidate, could benefit from a split anti-agreement unionist vote, because Cedric Wilson, an anti-agreement fringe unionist, is standing. Other battlegrounds Upper Bann (U) David Trimble, the UUP leader, faces challenges on a series of fronts. Anti-agreement members of his local party are hoping to deselect him, although this is likely to fail. The DUP hopes that Orangemen angry at restrictions imposed on the local Drumcree parade will flock to their candidate. But the DUP was a long way behind Mr Trimble in the 1997 election and the assembly election. South Antrim (U) A battle between the two anti-agreement unionists who contested the seat in last year's byelection.The DUP's William McCrea, who captured the seat from the UUP, is hoping to see off another challenge from the UUP's David Burnside. Other seats South Belfast (U) Martin Smyth, anti-agreement UUP MP, should hold seat. East Belfast (U) Peter Robinson, DUP deputy leader, certain to hold staunchly unionist seat. West Belfast (N) Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, will retain seat. Newry and Armagh (N) Seamus Mallon, SDLP deputy leader, should hold seat. Mid Ulster (N) Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein education minister, will have little difficulty in holding seat. Lagan Valley (U) Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of anti-agreement UUP faction, likely to retain seat. Foyle (N) John Hume, SDLP leader, will hold seat. But it may be his last election contest. South Down (N) SDLP's Eddie McGrady will hold seat. North Down (U) Independent anti-agreement unionist Bob McCartney should hold seat, helped by divisions within UUP camp. East Antrim (U) Anti-agreement UUP Roy Beggs will hold seat. North Antrim (U) DUP leader Ian Paisley will hold seat. It may be last poll outing for Mr Paisley, 75 this month.",

In particular, its extreme touchiness to perceived slights from the west is evidence of a disturbing fact: that although China desperately needs western trade, technology, and capital, the dominant section of its leadership is profoundly hostile to the west, and resents being dependent on it.</p> <p>Under government influence, China's media described the spy plane's flight as an \"invasion,\" and linked it directly to the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. The two incidents are cited as evidence of western, and specifically American, hostility. Chinese public xenophobia is thereby roused, serving the regime's propaganda aims of reducing western attractiveness to young Chinese, and propping itself up by directing attention towards a supposed outside enemy. An apology from America over the spy plane incident was seen as a essential for propaganda purposes; which is why Chinese news media began selectively translating American regrets over the loss of China's fighter aircraft as if they were the apology demanded, thus preparing the Chinese public for announcement of the crew's release.</p> <p>The use of anti-western propaganda has been standard practice by the communist leadership in China since its victory in 1949. During the years I lived in Beijing and subsequently worked as a China human rights activist, I saw many instances of the regime's divided attitude to things western, but could not fail to recognise its underlying tenor as hostile. In analysing China's attitude to the spy plane incident, one premise has to be that China does not see the west in terms of present or potential partners and friends, but as a rival and a threat.</p> <p>One obvious reason for China's insistence on an apology was to gain time for its intelligence services to examine the spy plane's equipment, and to eavesdrop on the crew. But the foreign relations game masked a perennial battle within China's ruling Communist party between modernisers and the old guard. The latter are the last phalanx of leaders directly connected to the party's early revolutionary struggles, most notably the Long March of 1934-5 which saved them from defeat. They remain dominant, and have their followers among the younger generation of leaders. These latter accept the necessity of western trade and technological tutelage, but regard it as supping with the devil; their prickliness over the spy plane incident is a measure of the length of chopsticks they accordingly use.</p> <p>These attitudes are not products of Communist party ideology but a longstanding feature of Chinese relations with the outside world. In this respect China's contemporary leaders are no different from Empress Ci Xi a century ago, who supported the Boxer Rebellion aimed at expelling all foreigners from Chinese soil. Modernisers in her time were regarded as traitors and that attitude persists, which is the fatal weakness in the position of such leaders as Jiang Zemin, who recognise that without engagement with the west, China will fall behind in world terms.</p> <p>This fear is the key to a further aspect of Chinese attitudes. The Chinese nourish enormous historical resentment towards the west as a result of foreign domination in the 19th century. China had then long been weak because its institutions and army were antiquated and its economy too reliant on subsistence agriculture. It fell easy prey to the commercial exploitation, missionary arrogance and territorial depredations inflicted on it by foreign powers. Feeble attempts at resistance were heavily punished, as when British and French troops famously destroyed the emperor's summer palace outside Beijing in reprisal for infringement of foreign rights on Chinese soil.</p> <p>These historical insults are galling because China always had, and has still, a \"master-race\" syndrome. It has always regarded itself as superior to the rest of the world, an attitude fostered by its justly held pride in once being, in Tang times (6th to 10th century AD), the world's most advanced country. Chinese attitudes remain racist and supremacist, to a degree startling to foreigners when they first encounter Chinese hostility to black people, and learn of their belief that the \"minority peoples\" who live as colonised populations within China's current borders are less evolutionarily advanced than the Han Chinese.</p> <p>A persistent theme in China since 1949 has been the impulse to growth in military power and territorial expansion, under the guise of \"reclaiming\" past possessions, and the realisation of its superpower aspirations. China's huge but once useless army suffered humiliating defeats in Vietnam; now that its military technology and capacity has been and continues to be upgraded dramatically, it has grown in confidence - witness its newly aggressive stance towards US monitoring. The collision between one of its fighters and the US spy plane shows how aggressive its posture has become.</p> <p>It is a mistake to think that, under its present regime, China can be treated as a reliably peaceful partner in trade and international relations. Western treatment of China should instead be premised on the fact that China is a potentially rogue state, which will not flinch from any means to get its way if it thinks it can succeed - especially as regards Taiwan, where the prospect of an invasion by China is a real one.</p> <p>One need only look at the persistently high level of human rights violations in China, and its brutal behaviour in Tibet, to see how it is capable of acting.</p> <p>The west needs to operate a policy of severe containment until China has democratic institutions. Chief among them should be trade sanctions and restrictions, withholding full membership of the international community, denying China cosmetic triumphs such as the Olympic Games, and maintaining pressure on China's widespread human-rights violations.</p> <p>The US should continue to arm Taiwan and support its autonomy; and the west collectively should keep watch over China's other territorial ambitions, especially towards Mongolia and the islands of the South China sea. All China's claims about \"reclaiming\" its territories are a nonsense - it is a regional imperialist power, as witness its occupation of Tibet, Xinjiang, and other minority areas (the so-called \"autonomous regions\") which China has colonised over the centuries. These colonies will fight back one day, as is already happening in Tibet and Xinjiang, and China will not be able to contain them indefinitely. Perhaps their efforts ought to be supported by the west, since that is a good way of preoccupying China, reducing its threat to peace in the Pacific region and hastening the demise of the current regime.</p> <p>That, at any rate, is the moral to be drawn from the agenda concealed behind China's anger over the spy plane incident.

As a kitchen worker (responsible for preparing the vegetarian diets - his Gypsy pie has been known to lift the morale of the whole prison) he regularly has to start work at 6am. But he is a good neighbour. We have lived alongside one another for over a year, yet I have never been disturbed by his dawn rise.</p> <p>You could say he is one of the old school who knows how to conduct himself in jail. He has done a lot of time over the past three decades. But he never complains and bothers nobody. \"It's my own fault I'm here,\" he says whenever his recategorisation or parole knock-backs crop up in conversation. \"Let's face it,\" he is fond of saying as we sit together in Big Rinty's cell, trying to deconstruct the system over a jug of coffee, \"would you take a chance on a man with a history like mine?\"</p> <p>But Felix is asking the wrong people. Unlike the authorities, when a prisoner looks at a fellow prisoner he does not see the history, only the man.</p> <p>Felix presents a cool character, calm and steady. But it wasn't always that way.

      "bodyText": "Felix the gambler lives in the cell next door to mine. As a kitchen worker (responsible for preparing the vegetarian diets - his Gypsy pie has been known to lift the morale of the whole prison) he regularly has to start work at 6am. But he is a good neighbour. We have lived alongside one another for over a year, yet I have never been disturbed by his dawn rise. You could say he is one of the old school who knows how to conduct himself in jail. He has done a lot of time over the past three decades. But he never complains and bothers nobody. \"It's my own fault I'm here,\" he says whenever his recategorisation or parole knock-backs crop up in conversation. \"Let's face it,\" he is fond of saying as we sit together in Big Rinty's cell, trying to deconstruct the system over a jug of coffee, \"would you take a chance on a man with a history like mine?\" But Felix is asking the wrong people. Unlike the authorities, when a prisoner looks at a fellow prisoner he does not see the history, only the man. Felix presents a cool character, calm and steady. But it wasn't always that way. Once, during an earlier sentence, a prison psychiatrist told him that he had \"the mind of the mad monkey - you want to be somewhere else, you want to be something else and you want to be somebody else\". \"So what's the cure?\" Felix asked the psychiatrist. \"There is no cure,\" came the reply.

The American embassy in Macedonia's capital, Skopje, said yesterday that the equipment was \"the latest technology\", and that it \"fully meets Nato standards\". The move follows the EU's stabilisation and association agreement earlier this week, which gave Macedonia generous trade terms. Macedonia responded yesterday by setting up a commission to guarantee equal treatment of its ethnic Albanian minority, which makes up about 30% of the population. The majority group is of Slav origin. After meeting leading politicians from both communities to discuss the new commission, President Boris Trajkovski said: \"This is a very special situation in Macedonia, and we want to reach a general consensus.\" The commission will also investigate ways to fight organised crime. The US has urged Mr Trajkovski's government, which includes two ethnic Albanian parties, to face up to the \"legitimate grievances and long-standing concerns\" of the country's minority. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, will address that issue in Macedonia today before flying to Kosovo and Bosnia. He will also caution the Macedonian government to use \"proportionate\" force against the rebels, a US official in Paris with Mr Powell said yesterday. While describing the rebels as \"terrorists\", the EU is concerned about provoking further militancy among Macedonia's minority ethnic group. The United States is worried about this too. The Macedonian government had accused Nato-led peacekeepers of being soft on the rebels on the Kosovo side of the border. Meanwhile, Nato-led peace keepers detained 12 suspected ethnic Albanian guerrillas crossing into Kosovo from Albania, a United Nations police spokesman said yesterday. They were suspected of belonging to a guerrilla group operating in Macedonia, the UN spokesman told Reuters news agency. Rebels of the self-styled Na tional Liberation Army emerged in Macedonia last month claiming they were fighting for equal rights for the country's large Albanian minority. Two weeks ago German peacekeepers detained 44 suspected guerrillas crossing the border into Kosovo with refugees fleeing the fighting in Macedonia.",

      "body": "<p>As many as 25% of small farms will have closed by 2005, according to government projections the Guardian revealed yesterday. But the present crisis in the countryside is a psycho-spiritual, as well as a political and financial, one.</p> <p>With the increasing industrialisation of agriculture (along with every other part of daily life), the countryside had become the repository of our most romantic, and some would say sentimental, spiritual longings - the raw to the city's cooked.</p> <p>Of course, on some level we all knew that it was made by humans, yet still its place as the guardian of the natural - a place somehow beyond capital and labour - seemed secure. Now that looks to change. The disappearance of small farms will make the romantic rural fiction hard to sustain.</p> <p>The past six weeks have certainly been a steep learning curve for townies. Which of us back in February knew about the homing instincts of hefted sheep (which seems like some conceit out of Little Bo Beep)? Or how unwild the Lake District really is, and how threatening real wildness would be to its cherished landscape?</p> <p>For farmers, the psycho-spiritual issues have become immediate. Bound up with their animals, rhythms, theirs is the original 24/7 life, without holidays. Early retirement or the slaughter of their animals leaves a hole much larger than job-sized. It's as if part of the farmer himself has been culled.</p> <p>Andrew Samuels, professor of psychology at Essex, believes the crisis \"is a terrific blow in the spiritual area. People who work with animals have a lot of meaning in their work - a craft-based spirituality which most of us no longer have, and this strikes at that meaning\".</p> <p>Though vegetarians might scoff, there's usually something paternally protective about farmers' relationship with their animals - at least until market-time. But the peremptory requisitioning of herds for culling has induced a sense of impotence and helplessness. One phoned the Rural Stress Information Network and said to the volunteer manning the helpline, \"Will you talk to me while they shoot my animals?\" The volunteer could hear the gunfire as he spoke.</p> <p>Vets are similarly affected. It wouldn't be surprising, when the foot and mouth crisis is over, to see an epidemic of post-traumatic stress disorder among vets who've been forced into the role of executioner and had to sign the animals over for slaughter.</p> <p>Farmers are also experiencing a sense of historical failure and guilt. They become attached to a pedigree herd or flock, perhaps started by a great-grandfather, and in the family for generations. Though he can't directly blame himself for what's happened, nevertheless he is now the generation which lost a herd. The whole heritage of the family that was under his custodianship has gone.</p> <p>With farming now going the way of mining and fishing, it's another stage in the occupational shift away from brawn, leaving farmers with few alternatives. Yet the majority of phone calls to the volunteer Farm Crisis Network asking for help for male farmers come from women (a wife, sister, or friend). Most farmers still aspire to be masterful and lack a language through which to articulate loss. In common with most men in our culture, they find it easier to express rage than grief: the anger directed at Tony Blair can be understood, at least partly, in this plight.</p> <p>Many of the calls to the helplines are deeply distressing, and the volunteers themselves need supporting. In the case of the FCN, some of those people manning the phones are going through the same experience themselves, with their own animals being slaughtered.</p> <p>The British countryside is awash with grief. No psychobabble needed here, but this is an opportunity, beyond the Princess Diana mass hysteria, to speak openly about the painful process of grieving and loss, both personal and collective.</p> <p>For we're all of us psychologically affected. Images of giant cranes tipping carcasses into vast graves stir memories of newsreel footage of mass burials in newly liberated Bergen-Belsen. Coming after BSE, floods, railway failure, and with its likely permanent impact on the landscape and ecology, the agricultural crisis seems an irrefutable declaration that the infrastructure is buckling beneath natural forces which our social system is utterly inequipped to tackle.

      "bodyText": "As many as 25% of small farms will have closed by 2005, according to government projections the Guardian revealed yesterday. But the present crisis in the countryside is a psycho-spiritual, as well as a political and financial, one. With the increasing industrialisation of agriculture (along with every other part of daily life), the countryside had become the repository of our most romantic, and some would say sentimental, spiritual longings - the raw to the city's cooked. Of course, on some level we all knew that it was made by humans, yet still its place as the guardian of the natural - a place somehow beyond capital and labour - seemed secure. Now that looks to change. The disappearance of small farms will make the romantic rural fiction hard to sustain. The past six weeks have certainly been a steep learning curve for townies. Which of us back in February knew about the homing instincts of hefted sheep (which seems like some conceit out of Little Bo Beep)? Or how unwild the Lake District really is, and how threatening real wildness would be to its cherished landscape? For farmers, the psycho-spiritual issues have become immediate. Bound up with their animals, rhythms, theirs is the original 24/7 life, without holidays. Early retirement or the slaughter of their animals leaves a hole much larger than job-sized. It's as if part of the farmer himself has been culled. Andrew Samuels, professor of psychology at Essex, believes the crisis \"is a terrific blow in the spiritual area. People who work with animals have a lot of meaning in their work - a craft-based spirituality which most of us no longer have, and this strikes at that meaning\". Though vegetarians might scoff, there's usually something paternally protective about farmers' relationship with their animals - at least until market-time. But the peremptory requisitioning of herds for culling has induced a sense of impotence and helplessness. One phoned the Rural Stress Information Network and said to the volunteer manning the helpline, \"Will you talk to me while they shoot my animals?\" The volunteer could hear the gunfire as he spoke. Vets are similarly affected. It wouldn't be surprising, when the foot and mouth crisis is over, to see an epidemic of post-traumatic stress disorder among vets who've been forced into the role of executioner and had to sign the animals over for slaughter. Farmers are also experiencing a sense of historical failure and guilt. They become attached to a pedigree herd or flock, perhaps started by a great-grandfather, and in the family for generations. Though he can't directly blame himself for what's happened, nevertheless he is now the generation which lost a herd. The whole heritage of the family that was under his custodianship has gone. With farming now going the way of mining and fishing, it's another stage in the occupational shift away from brawn, leaving farmers with few alternatives. Yet the majority of phone calls to the volunteer Farm Crisis Network asking for help for male farmers come from women (a wife, sister, or friend). Most farmers still aspire to be masterful and lack a language through which to articulate loss. In common with most men in our culture, they find it easier to express rage than grief: the anger directed at Tony Blair can be understood, at least partly, in this plight. Many of the calls to the helplines are deeply distressing, and the volunteers themselves need supporting. In the case of the FCN, some of those people manning the phones are going through the same experience themselves, with their own animals being slaughtered. The British countryside is awash with grief. No psychobabble needed here, but this is an opportunity, beyond the Princess Diana mass hysteria, to speak openly about the painful process of grieving and loss, both personal and collective. For we're all of us psychologically affected. Images of giant cranes tipping carcasses into vast graves stir memories of newsreel footage of mass burials in newly liberated Bergen-Belsen. Coming after BSE, floods, railway failure, and with its likely permanent impact on the landscape and ecology, the agricultural crisis seems an irrefutable declaration that the infrastructure is buckling beneath natural forces which our social system is utterly inequipped to tackle. While some people find this politically and ideologically cheering in an \"I told you so\", kind of way, they also find such a major tectonic shift in the country scary. The erosion of agriculture-as-we-know-it, without the prospect of an organic utopia to take its place, leaves us all with profound questions about our relationship to the commercial and the natural - issues much more commanding and pressing than we could ever have suspected at the innocent start of the year. \u0095 George Monbiot is away.

They must have an option,\" said the Soil Association, which is co-ordinating the move. \"They have been told that vaccinated animals have to be slaughtered but this is not true.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, opposition to the slaughter was growing with many farmers in Gloucestershire and Cumbria protesting at what they called Maff's \"arrogance and incompetence\" and at the slipshod methods of disposal.</p> <p>\"People are getting vocal and angry now,\" said Gail Bennet, of Bollow, near Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire, who is disputing Maff's order to kill her farm animals.</p> <p>\"There have been misdiagnoses.

Warwickshire, where carcasses were being dumped. \"Blood was running across the road,\" said a member of Friends of the Earth. \"It's clear the assurances given by Maff are worthless.\"</p>

      "bodyText": "Environment and conservation groups with a combined membership of more than 3m have formed a coalition to protest against the Ministry of Agriculture's mass slaughter policy and to ask for selective vaccination of stock. The National Trust, RSPB, Soil Association, Wildlife Trusts and many smaller organisations, including university departments, companies, research institutions and preservation groups, have set up Farmers for Voluntary Vaccination. \"Giving farmers an alternative to slaughter in the firebreak zones is the only way to regain their confidence. They must have an option,\" said the Soil Association, which is co-ordinating the move. \"They have been told that vaccinated animals have to be slaughtered but this is not true.\" Meanwhile, opposition to the slaughter was growing with many farmers in Gloucestershire and Cumbria protesting at what they called Maff's \"arrogance and incompetence\" and at the slipshod methods of disposal. \"People are getting vocal and angry now,\" said Gail Bennet, of Bollow, near Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire, who is disputing Maff's order to kill her farm animals. \"There have been misdiagnoses. I am refusing to let Maff on my farm. They are incompetent and arrogant. They confirmed my sheep were not infected weeks ago, but they cannot admit they have made mistakes.\" Clive Davies, a Gloucestershire farmer who lost his herd of 255 cattle to a cull later proved to have been carried out through clerical error, said he was furious with the ministry. \"You become a statistic... it becomes a rollercoaster and there is no stopping it.\" As demonstrators marched through Carlisle yesterday to protest against bureaucratic delay in getting government cash to help Cumbria's tourist-based businesses, farmers in the county and in Gloucestershire were blockading their farms, preparing legal injunctions and protesting at the methods of carcass disposal. Up to 20 farmers used tractors to block off a landfill site at Ufton, Warwickshire, where carcasses were being dumped. \"Blood was running across the road,\" said a member of Friends of the Earth. \"It's clear the assurances given by Maff are worthless.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

Precautions were vigorously imposed.</p> <p>With 1,000 residents, the village was known for its cosy hotels, good pubs and scenery. Tourism had been badly hit but had started to rise slightly.</p> <p>Then the first foot and mouth case was discovered, and rumours began that illegal movement of sheep had caused it. Suspicion, and threats of revenge, spread down the cobbled lanes.</p> <p>Yesterday, lorries carrying carcasses thundered by. Soldiers wandered outside the fish and chip shop, and villagers wiped away tears.</p> <p>Last Sunday, Maurice Dickeson, 40, of Orchard Farm found his sheep had stiff legs.

      "bodyText": "Birds sang, daffodils bloomed and a farmer was rooted to the ground, afraid he would be shot like his diseased animals. Until this week, the village of Middleton-in-Teesdale was considered by locals to be \"miraculously\" free of foot and mouth. Precautions were vigorously imposed. With 1,000 residents, the village was known for its cosy hotels, good pubs and scenery. Tourism had been badly hit but had started to rise slightly. Then the first foot and mouth case was discovered, and rumours began that illegal movement of sheep had caused it. Suspicion, and threats of revenge, spread down the cobbled lanes. Yesterday, lorries carrying carcasses thundered by. Soldiers wandered outside the fish and chip shop, and villagers wiped away tears. Last Sunday, Maurice Dickeson, 40, of Orchard Farm found his sheep had stiff legs. He called his vet, who confirmed foot and mouth at 1pm. By mid-afternoon, slaughtermen had shot his 1,500 sheep and 160 cattle, spread over eight holdings. Notices were served on around 20 neighbouring farms that they would be culled in order to contain the disease. Then the rumours started as to what Mr Dickeson had been doing with his sheep while others tried to protect theirs from the disease. Villagers claimed he had been illegally moving animals. Mr Dickeson told police he had received threats. The police advised him to move his wife and two sons, of primary school age, away. Mr Dickeson refused. As trading standards officials investigate allegations of illegal movement, Mr Dickeson remains on his farm, glued to the television for information - and the atmosphere in the village grows tense. Mr Dickeson said: \"We did everything right. Then rumours started flying that we had moved sheep to places we have never been to. I can understand how neighbours feel when they have had their sheep taken away. It is bad enough watching the wagons going to their fields. \"We are not moving. We haven't done owt wrong. We are going to stay on our farm. There is a \u00a35,000 fine for illegal movements. \"Why would anyone move sheep illegally? Someone would always see you doing it. It is just that someone has set a stupid rumour off. If there are rumours, you always get someone believing it.\" He said that fleeing his farm would look like admitting guilt. Mr Dickeson said that last month he applied to Maff for a licence to transport 100 sheep two and a half miles. The vet had come and inspected them and given the all clear to move them. He had moved his sheep for welfare reasons. The fields were in danger of getting wet and muddy. Three days later, the same sheep were confirmed to have foot and mouth, but the vet had not known when she inspected them as symptoms could lie dormant. Mr Dickeson said once the disease was confirmed, he accepted Maff's set tariff for livestock, rather than value them, so as to speed the cull up and protect other farms. One villager said: \"If it's true that he has done something wrong, I don't envy his chances.\" Richard Betton, a local farmer and vice-chairman of the NFU hillfarming committee, said that the outbreak was near many pedigree animals and hefted sheep - which have adapted to the hills - and could cause devastation to local farming. A spokesman for Durham police said: \"We are aware that a farmer has received threats. Our ability to investigate any allegations would depend on what was offered to us.\" Police had advised the farmer that it would be \"in everyone's interests\" if he considered moving elsewhere, the spokesman added.

An estimated 5,000 babies with HIV are born every day in South Africa. For months the church has been criticising President Thabo Mbeki's Aids policy. The Archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane, said in September that the government's inaction would be judged \"as serious a crime against humanity as apartheid\". The aim of the God's Babies campaign is to provide the drugs AZT and nevirapine, which halve the infection rate between mothers and children, and to enable poor women to bottle-feed their babies, to reduce the transmission of HIV through breast-feeding.

At first Pretoria said it could not afford to supply nevirapine, but after the manufacturer offered to supply it free for trials the health ministry questioned its safety. Nono Simelela, head of the government Aids programme, implied that the issue was beyond the health minister's control, because the president has taken such a direct interest.

      "body": "<p>Poland and other eastern European candidates wanting to join the EU could be forced to wait seven years after admittance before their workers can move freely within the union, under a European commission proposal.</p> <p>In a move that will dismay most of the 12 aspiring members, the commission yesterday recommended a \"flexible moratorium\" of up to seven years after accession - an unmistakable response to German fears of being swamped by cheap labour from the east.</p> <p>Publicly, most of the candidate countries will condemn this proposal as discriminatory. But in private they acknowledge that they have few cards to play, except perhaps to warn of increasing impatience - and Euroscepticism - among their own people, caused by the long wait to join the 15-member club.</p> <p>In Poland, the largest of the candidates with a population of 40m, the government is already under fire for falling behind other applicants in the race for EU membership.</p> <p>Announcing the decision, Gunter Verheugen, the commissioner for enlargement, reflected the position of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who is concerned about an influx of Poles when the newcomers start joining, probably in 2005.</p> <p>\"This is an extremely sensitive issue for European Union nations and for applicant countries,\" said Mr Verheugen, himself a German.</p> <p>Enlargement - a priority for Tony Blair - is the biggest single challenge facing the union in the years to come following the launch of the single currencyfrom 1999 to 2002.</p> <p>Wary of anti-foreigner sentiment and a rightwing backlash, Mr Schr\u00f6der and the Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, have responded to the fears of trade unions, concerned that existing pay and benefits would be eroded by cheap labour.</p> <p>The candidate countries all want immediate freedom of movement for their citizens after enlargement, although Spain and Portugal both faced a seven-year transition for their workers after they joined in 1985.</p> <p>Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia are the leading ex-communist candidates for the EU's biggest enlargement. A second group comprises Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p> <p>Cyprus and Malta are not affected because of their relative wealth and small populations.</p> <p>\"Full freedom of movement would apply after seven years at the latest,\" Mr Verheugen said.</p> <p>The proposal must now be approved by the leaders of the 15 member states.</p> <p>The commission proposal means that a general transition period would be imposed for five years after a candidate's accession.</p> <p>After that, countries that felt their labour markets faced \"serious disruption\" could ask for a maximum two-year extension.</p> <p>In a further bid to ease the worries of the candidate states, who fear the arrangements will make them second-class citizens, the commission said it would review the labour situation two years after accession.</p> <p>Mr Verheugen said he regarded the extension clause as \"entirely theoretical\", noting that studies on the likely effects of enlargement on labour markets suggested a very limited impact.</p> <p>Many EU countries already face serious labour shortages in some sectors, especially hi-tech industries. But some experts argue that a transition period is in the candidates' own interests because unrestricted freedom of movement could trigger a westward brain drain of the young, talented and well-qualified.</p> <p>Under EU law, nationals of all member states can settle anywhere in the union if language is no problem and they have the right job qualifications.</p> <p>The commission estimated recently that admitting the 10 east European countries would produce a migration to existing member states of 3.9m people.

      "bodyText": "Poland and other eastern European candidates wanting to join the EU could be forced to wait seven years after admittance before their workers can move freely within the union, under a European commission proposal. In a move that will dismay most of the 12 aspiring members, the commission yesterday recommended a \"flexible moratorium\" of up to seven years after accession - an unmistakable response to German fears of being swamped by cheap labour from the east. Publicly, most of the candidate countries will condemn this proposal as discriminatory. But in private they acknowledge that they have few cards to play, except perhaps to warn of increasing impatience - and Euroscepticism - among their own people, caused by the long wait to join the 15-member club. In Poland, the largest of the candidates with a population of 40m, the government is already under fire for falling behind other applicants in the race for EU membership. Announcing the decision, Gunter Verheugen, the commissioner for enlargement, reflected the position of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who is concerned about an influx of Poles when the newcomers start joining, probably in 2005. \"This is an extremely sensitive issue for European Union nations and for applicant countries,\" said Mr Verheugen, himself a German. Enlargement - a priority for Tony Blair - is the biggest single challenge facing the union in the years to come following the launch of the single currencyfrom 1999 to 2002. Wary of anti-foreigner sentiment and a rightwing backlash, Mr Schr\u00f6der and the Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, have responded to the fears of trade unions, concerned that existing pay and benefits would be eroded by cheap labour. The candidate countries all want immediate freedom of movement for their citizens after enlargement, although Spain and Portugal both faced a seven-year transition for their workers after they joined in 1985. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia are the leading ex-communist candidates for the EU's biggest enlargement. A second group comprises Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. Cyprus and Malta are not affected because of their relative wealth and small populations. \"Full freedom of movement would apply after seven years at the latest,\" Mr Verheugen said. The proposal must now be approved by the leaders of the 15 member states. The commission proposal means that a general transition period would be imposed for five years after a candidate's accession. After that, countries that felt their labour markets faced \"serious disruption\" could ask for a maximum two-year extension. In a further bid to ease the worries of the candidate states, who fear the arrangements will make them second-class citizens, the commission said it would review the labour situation two years after accession. Mr Verheugen said he regarded the extension clause as \"entirely theoretical\", noting that studies on the likely effects of enlargement on labour markets suggested a very limited impact. Many EU countries already face serious labour shortages in some sectors, especially hi-tech industries. But some experts argue that a transition period is in the candidates' own interests because unrestricted freedom of movement could trigger a westward brain drain of the young, talented and well-qualified. Under EU law, nationals of all member states can settle anywhere in the union if language is no problem and they have the right job qualifications. The commission estimated recently that admitting the 10 east European countries would produce a migration to existing member states of 3.9m people. But it predicted that the economic impact would be minimal, since it would equal only 1% of the EU population and occur over 30 years.",

You nod off, knowing that if you get up in the night, the bathroom lights will automatically switch themselves on at one-third power, while your handheld computer updates its list of \"incident reports\" from motion detectors placed around the house and garden. Yes, that suburban fox has been trying to raid the dustbins again... </p> <p>Science fiction writers and journalists have been trotting out home automation stories for decades, of course. However, last week, the reality came a step closer. Two small British companies, Cyan Technology and nSine, announced chips that will enable consumer electronics products and white goods such as washing machines to be networked over the mains. The cost to manufacturers could be as low as $3 to $5 per network node. And at that price, the market could be huge: 10 to 15 billion nodes. </p> <p>David Griffiths, Cyan's chief executive officer, says: \"the point about consumer electronics is that it is very price-point driven. The kinds of thing we are doing with our chips have been do-able for about 20 years: the fundamental principles have been around for a long time. But the average consumer will not pay \u00a3100 a room to switch a light bulb off!\" </p> <p>Consumers might, however, be prepared to pay a little extra for \"smart goods\" that can be operated, monitored and perhaps metered remotely, if the facilities are built in. \"Technology that would have been \u00a3100, 20 years ago, we can now do for a couple of pounds,\" Griffiths says, \"and that makes it a viable product.\" </p> <p>Peter Norman, nSine's president and chief executive officer, agrees. \"We feel the technology is not the interesting part,\" he says. \"It is the second wave, and it is coming at a consumer price point. It is a breakthrough in cost as much as in making it work reliably. It will have a big economic effect on the consumer appliance industry.\" </p> <p>The impact could be visible fairly soon. NSine launched its nPlug in Japan with Softbank Networks and is now talking to far eastern consumer goods manufacturers. Cyan's e-Cog microcontroller is used in a \"home gateway\", which is being rolled out by <a href=\"http://www.Olameter.com\">Olameter</a> in California. The gateway uses Amino Communications' inter-process communications standard, IntAct, which Cyan has licensed. </p> <p>These systems stand some chance of reaching a mass consumer market because no one needs to install any extra wiring to use them. The network signals are sent over the existing electricity cables, and can therefore reach any device that is plugged into the mains. Norman says: \"the long term game plan is to put this technology in every plug in the world.\" </p> <p>So far it has been slow going. Some thought the future had arrived back in 1978, when BSR announced the X10 home automation system. This was the first mains-based home control system to be sold on the high street - in Tandy Radio Shack stores in the US - though it appealed mainly to computer buffs and electronics hobbyists. </p> <p>X10 was also a British invention (see <a href=\"http://www.hometoys.\">www.hometoys.com/htinews/oct99/articles/rye/rye.htm</a> for Dave Rye's potted history) and while it did well enough to be still on sale, it hardly swept the world. Acorn co-founder Chris Curry also had a go at the home control market with his Red Box company in the 1980s, with less success. More recently, the market has also been targeted by an alliance of two US giants, Sun and Cisco. </p> <p>Apart from the cost, mains-borne signalling has proved more difficult to implement than many people suspected. Norman describes the mains as \"a very hostile environment\". For a start, \"it is not a network, it's a Christmas tree\", he says, and this leads to all kinds of problems with reflected signals. As with mobile phone networks, you can get deep fades where reflected signals cancel one another out. </p> <p>\"Another problem is impulse noise,\" he says. \"Every motor, every switch on the network is providing impulses that can destroy data.\" </p> <p>The nSine system works as a sort of modem. All it does is move a packet of data from one place to another, but it neither knows nor cares what the data does. In other words, it is not the sort of thing consumers need to know about - an idea that Martyn Gilbert, chief executive officer of Amino Communications, takes to its logical conclusion. He thinks the technology must be so transparent that it becomes invisible, like the e-commerce involved in taking money from a cash machine. </p> <p>Amino's technology is aimed at the networked appliance market including television set top boxes and \"application specific video devices\" such as seat-back entertainment systems. However, Gilbert says he is not surprised that internet appliances have, so far, failed in the market, because they have no value. They should be given away as part of a service, which is what people want. </p> <p>\"What is the value of being able to turn on a kettle from nowhere,\" Gilbert says, \"and who is going to put the water in? Even in the days of the BBC Micro, we realised that just being able to do communications within the home was a speculative business at best and na\u00efve at worst. The value of the network is that it allows you to connect to a service. The definition of the service has to come first; the appliances come after.\" </p> <p>The difference nowadays, Gilbert says, is that the internet allows data to be delivered to the home. \"The infrastructure is here, so now let's start putting powerline [networks] into the context of remotely managed services.\" </p> <p>This exposes the flaw in the home automation story, and it is where Amino, Cyan and nSine are taking a different approach. </p> <p>Consumers who would never be interested in automating their homes might still pay a small monthly fee for, say, a networked fridge that was monitored from outside. The service company would make sure it operated constantly at the correct temperature, and call you if someone left the door open. It would have a repairman on the doorstep with a replacement part if remote diagnostics suggested it was about to go wrong. </p> <p>So don't think about buying a new washing machine. Think about \"the washing machine experience\" that service companies will soon be trying to sell you. </p> <p> <strong> Amino Communications</strong> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.aminocom.com \">www.aminocom.com</a></p> <p> A three year old technology licensing company, based in Cambridge.

X10 was also a British invention (see www.hometoys.com/htinews/oct99/articles/rye/rye.htm for Dave Rye's potted history) and while it did well enough to be still on sale, it hardly swept the world. Acorn co-founder Chris Curry also had a go at the home control market with his Red Box company in the 1980s, with less success. More recently, the market has also been targeted by an alliance of two US giants, Sun and Cisco. Apart from the cost, mains-borne signalling has proved more difficult to implement than many people suspected. Norman describes the mains as \"a very hostile environment\". For a start, \"it is not a network, it's a Christmas tree\", he says, and this leads to all kinds of problems with reflected signals. As with mobile phone networks, you can get deep fades where reflected signals cancel one another out. \"Another problem is impulse noise,\" he says. \"Every motor, every switch on the network is providing impulses that can destroy data.\" The nSine system works as a sort of modem. All it does is move a packet of data from one place to another, but it neither knows nor cares what the data does. In other words, it is not the sort of thing consumers need to know about - an idea that Martyn Gilbert, chief executive officer of Amino Communications, takes to its logical conclusion. He thinks the technology must be so transparent that it becomes invisible, like the e-commerce involved in taking money from a cash machine. Amino's technology is aimed at the networked appliance market including television set top boxes and \"application specific video devices\" such as seat-back entertainment systems. However, Gilbert says he is not surprised that internet appliances have, so far, failed in the market, because they have no value. They should be given away as part of a service, which is what people want. \"What is the value of being able to turn on a kettle from nowhere,\" Gilbert says, \"and who is going to put the water in? Even in the days of the BBC Micro, we realised that just being able to do communications within the home was a speculative business at best and na\u00efve at worst. The value of the network is that it allows you to connect to a service. The definition of the service has to come first; the appliances come after.\" The difference nowadays, Gilbert says, is that the internet allows data to be delivered to the home. \"The infrastructure is here, so now let's start putting powerline [networks] into the context of remotely managed services.\" This exposes the flaw in the home automation story, and it is where Amino, Cyan and nSine are taking a different approach. Consumers who would never be interested in automating their homes might still pay a small monthly fee for, say, a networked fridge that was monitored from outside. The service company would make sure it operated constantly at the correct temperature, and call you if someone left the door open. It would have a repairman on the doorstep with a replacement part if remote diagnostics suggested it was about to go wrong. So don't think about buying a new washing machine. Think about \"the washing machine experience\" that service companies will soon be trying to sell you. Amino Communications www.aminocom.com A three year old technology licensing company, based in Cambridge. It designs but does not manufacture products. Founder and chief executive officer Martyn Gilbert was the principal engineer on the Acorn BBC Master computer. Cyan Technology www.cyantechnology.com A chip design company spun out of Cambridge Consultants last year to commercialise 10 years' research, it has just announced the e-Cog 16-bit microcontroller. David Griffiths is the chief executive officer. Cyan has licensed IntAct communications technology from Amino. nSine www.nsine.com Young company based in Reading, which has developed the nPlug for powerline networking. Run by chief executive Peter Norman, who spent a decade at Psion. Peter Strong, co-founder and chief technology officer, was responsible for design of the Apricot microcomputer, which dominated the UK market in the early 80s.",

In Germany, Die Welt questions whether the European dot.com slump can be blamed on consumer fears about security. Meanwhile, in Madrid, El Pais reports that European consumers are being ripped off to the tune of \u00a3400m a year.</p> <p> From all corners of Europe comes the cry for tighter security measures to instill consumer confidence and stimulate e-commerce. Let's get one thing straight - credit card fraud is not out of control. Visa USA announced record low fraud losses in 1999, partly attributable to the fact that almost all transactions in the US are now authorised online: that is, when you use your credit card to pay for something in a US store, the retailers' point-of-sale (POS) terminal connects to a bank computer to check the card is OK. This is very effective in blocking bad cards. In Europe, high telecommunications charges have historically led to a situation where many transactions are not authorised online. Nor is card fraud anywhere near the top of the banking industry's agenda.</p> <p> Chargeoffs (when banks write off credit card debt) run at about 10 times chargebacks (when banks charge fraudulent transactions back to merchants) and are therefore far more worrisome. Internet credit card fraud is in a different category. It is considered one type of Card Not Present (CNP) fraud. Most of it is related to \"adult sites\" (a euphemism for pornography).</p> <p> According to Europay, if you remove the portion of fraud committed on adult sites, then internet fraud just about equals the amount of overall fraud at 0.1% of all transactions by value. Nevertheless, the European Commission is pushing a raft of counter-measures, including better police training, the establishment of an experts group on fraud prevention, and closer co-operation between credit card companies and the retail sector. But it's still too easy to get hold of someone's card details and use them over the internet or to make a bogus card. </p> <p>So what should be done, and who should do it? The banking sector has the power to solve the problem, but not the incentive. The payment industry's first attempt, the Secure Electronic Transaction protocol (SET), failed miserably. It was just too complicated and too costly to roll out. Neither are European banks rushing for its successor, called 3D SET, not surprisingly, in that it transfers some of the fraud liability from retailers to banks. </p> <p>The situation might improve this summer when Visa changes its rules so that merchants using 3D SET to authenticate consumers - by accepting payment from bank-issued \"server side wallets\" - will not be liable for fraudulent transactions. Server side wallet is a secure software on a bank's computer that consumers can access from any PC, Wap phone, or TV set by typing in a user name and password. The wallet then sends the customer's card number and other details such as shipping address to the merchant. A number of alternative solutions also exist. </p> <p> Pseduo number systems create a unique 16-digit card number for each transaction which the online merchant processes in the usual way, and the consumer's real card number is never revealed. The arrival of pre-paid plastic cards shows promise. One example is Splash Plastic, launched last month and aimed at the seven million British teenagers that want to buy online but don't have credit cards or bank accounts. The card is credited with cash at one of the thousands of PayPoint terminals in retail stores. Stopping teens from buying things they shouldn't (eg, pornography or guns) may be a problem, which is why Splash Plastic is careful to vet online merchants.</p> <p> What would really benefit consumers and merchants would be a switch from magnetic stripe \"dumb\" cards that use signatures at the point of sale to computer chip smart cards with a PIN. French banks, which have used smart cards for years, suffer a fraction the fraud of British banks. If consumers became accustomed to putting their smart cards into their PCs when they wanted to buy something, the CNP fraud problem would be reduced at a stroke.</p> <p> So why don't they? So far, the case for banks converting to smart cards has been weak, since their losses to fraud have been less than the cost of the new cards, terminals and so on. But now that the transition to smart cards is accelerating, perhaps the opportunity to use them in new ways will provide real incentives to change.</p>",

RealNetworks, the maker of the dominant streaming media software RealPlayer, says it is still working on the technology that will allow music companies to trust the internet with copyrighted material. Initially, the service will be offered through AOL and the RealNetworks site. </p> <p>MusicNet will also give Napster the opportunity to license the service if Napster, like any other interested company, can satisfy legal, copyright and security concerns. Last year, Bertelsmann incurred the wrath of rivals by investing $100m in the service, which is now under court order to shut down copyright-infringing traffic. </p> <p>Although MusicNet hopes to line up similar agreements with the two other major firms, Sony Music Entertainment and Vivendi's Universal Music Group, they have set up their own, rival system, Duet, using the troubled portal Yahoo! as the platform. However, critical details still need to be resolved, such as how much consumers will be charged and which software technologies will deliver the music to their computers. </p> <p>Universal, the world's largest music company, has also reached agreement to acquire online service EMusic, and plans to incoporate it into Duet. </p> <p>The service is due to be available this summer for a monthly fee but initially will only offer access to streaming music. Eventually, consumers will be able to download specific songs and create personalised playlists and sharing privileges with other Duet members. </p> <p>Duet and MusicNet are not alone: The digital arm of MTV, MTVi, is also launching a service that allows people to download songs - for a price - from all five major record companies. MTVi is launching its service in partnership with RioPort.com Inc, which has created software to keep track of the parties that need to be compensated when a song is sold. </p> <p>Performers and songwriters are also entitled to royalties. The elaborate system of publishing and mechanic royalties that exists in the real-world music business model has yet to developed for the internet, though RioPort claims to have the technology. \"Each label takes a different approach to copyrights, but RioPort has made that invisible to consumers,\" says MTVi's Nicholas Butterworth. </p> <p>Also setting up shop is Microsoft. MSN says it will offer a free web-based service that resembles a custom- tailored radio channel. The service allows users to specify a sound or mood of music and then listen to a stream of comparable songs. But users cannot listen to a particular song on demand, nor can they download and keep the songs - an important distinction, as it relieves Microsoft of the need to negotiate individually with record labels for copyright licences. </p> <p>But the range of services that will be on offer are unlikely to make life easy for a consumer who cares little about specific record companies. </p> <p>Duet can potentially offer almost 50% of the world's music versus MusicNet's roughly 40%. A more probable solution is a service, such as MTVi, that offers everything at one bazaar. MTVi says its system, which will use Microsoft's media player, will post about 10,000 songs by the end of April and make the entire catalog from all five labels downloadable by the end of 2002. </p> <p>Moreover, the competing systems do not offer a standard for music downloads. The rules of whether downloads can be placed on portable devices or burned to a CD-R have not been set, nor have the file protocols been established. MP3s, for all their flexibility, are sonically inferior as the files are electronically compressed. </p> <p>Both Universal and Sony have developed much of their technology in-house. Universal built Bluematter, a proprietary downloading format, and operates eLabs and Global-e, which deploys the label's technology solutions. Sony, with its large consumer electronics arm, has developed a digital music player as well as its own codec for digital music, ATRAC3; AOL Time Warner has its own research labs along with RealNetworks, and EMI has ties with Microsoft. </p> <p>The record industry's new online music plans need to become less confusing to be successful, says Ashish Singh, media analyst at Bain &amp; Co, a consulting firm.

Violence by Mr Mugabe's supporters, including police, has been reported across the country as the ruling party, the Zanu-PF, tries to stamp out support for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) before presidential elections next year. Mr Hondora went to Sadza at the weekend with two other lawyers to investigate reports that police were assaulting people scheduled to testify in a court case challenging the victory in last year's parliamentary election of a Zanu-PF candidate, the war veterans' leader Chenjerai Hunzvi. They saw about 30 people, most wearing Zanu-PF T-shirts, beating Nelson Chivanga, one of the witnesses in the case, a statement issued by the lawyers' group said. Uniformed police officers stood by and watched, it said. The assailants then turned on the three lawyers, calling them \"foreigners\", although they are black Zimbabweans. Mr Hondora was kicked, slapped, punched, whipped and hit behind the ear with a stone. He was forced to chant Zanu-PF slogans while marching to the police station, where he and Mr Chivanga were further tortured by police, the statement said. At the station, the police told them that the MDC was just a front for white people. The lawyers' group said yesterday it was \"outraged by the continued brutality, lack of respect for fundamental human rights and political partisanship of the Zimbabwe Republic Police\". \"We condemn police involvement with the vigilante groups of Zanu-PF supporters who are creating a reign of terror in Zimbabwe.\"",

      "bodyText": "Suresh Grover, the spokesperson for the family of Muhammad Najeib, has asked us to make it clear that contrary to a statement in our report How tabloid tactics wrecked the trial, page 3, April 10, the Najeib family has not entered into any financial agreement with the Mirror newspaper in relation to any interviews. In a report headed MEPs vote for ban on sale of cosmetics tested on animals, page 6, April 4, we quoted remarks by the MEP Phillip Whitehead which could be interpreted as stating that Est\u00e9e Lauder companies still tested cosmetics on animals. In fact, they do not and have not done so for the past decade. Mr Whitehead has asked us to say that he regrets this error. In addition, he would like us to point out that not only do Est\u00e9e Lauder companies themselves do no animal testing, they do not ask or require any other companies to do it for them. In our short profile of the businessman Trevor Hemmings, accompanying a feature on Blackpool, page 22, April 10, we said that Mr Hemmings employed 7,000 people \"at his hotels, 3,500 pubs, the Vymura wallpaper firm and in horseracing'.' Mr Hemmings does employ 7,000 people, but, in fact, he owns 800 pubs, not 3,500, and they are mainly tenanted involving no employee relationship. In a report headed Scientists find way to turn fat into muscle, page 6, April 10, we mentioned the University of Los Angeles when we should have referred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Profuse apologies to the Hon IA Laurent who, having placed a birth announcement under the names of Annabelle Lever and Dan Grecu to announce the arrival of their son Gabriel on March 18 in Boston, saw it appear under the heading Death notices on the Obituaries page of Monday's Guardian.

The regulator said yesterday it had issued a petition in the Edinburgh court of session seeking the winding up of Barum House Securities Limited, which is now no longer trading and had around 200 customers, mostly from the local area.

At the bank's annual meeting in Edinburgh, shareholders showed their disapproval by casting an unusually large vote against the reappointment of two directors. Viscount Younger, the outgoing chairman, said the bank was \"sorry\" if shareholders felt they had been inadequately consulted about the bonuses paid to four of the bank's senior directors, including his successor, Sir George Mathewson.

One small shareholder won applause by saying that Sir George's comments suggested \"arrogance\". To protest against the special bonuses, the National Association of Pension Funds, whose members control some 25% of the stock market, had advised pension funds to vote against the reappointment of two senior non-executives, British Telecom boss Sir Iain Vallance and banker Sir Angus Grossart. Both sit on the remuneration committee which approved the bonuses and, while both were re-elected, leading institutional in vestors, who did not speak, insisted that the votes of 10% and 15% respectively against the reappointments were larger than usual. \"The whole point is to send a message,\" one said. \"These votes are more normally like being elected to the politburo.

      "body": "<p>The Post Office faced an uphill struggle yesterday to convince the new industry regulator and consumer watchdog of its case for raising the cost of both first and second class letters by 1p, writes David Gow . </p> <p>They would rise to 28p and 20p respectively from October 1.

They would rise to 28p and 20p respectively from October 1. First-class mail rose to 27p last April when the PO cut the cost of second-class letters, after a five-year freeze, from 20p to 19p. PostComm, the regulator, said it would consider the PO's application to increase prices from October 1 \"carefully and critically\", pointing out that it would be allowed only if \"there is a significant risk to the company's ability to finance its licensed activities\". It added that the PO, now known as Consignia, must also prove that no other course -such as improving efficiency - is appropriate. The industry regulator, which issued the PO's firstlicence in its 350-year history late last month, and the new consumer watchdog, PostWatch, made plain that the proposed increases would be subjectto stringent consultation. Peter Carr, PostWatch chairman, claimed that Consignia had been arguing for a price freeze just 10 days before its licence was granted and the increases in stamps and other products would cost customers \u00a3280m over 18 months - on top of \u00a3240m increases over three years in other parts of the PO business already conceded. \"Service levels to customers are at their lowest for years.

In the past five years first-class had gone down 8% in real terms and second-class by 16%. Mr Carr said the case for raising prices to fund new investment was \"pretty thin\", adding: \"What are they doing with all the money they've had before?\" Mr Dykes insisted, however, that some increases were now crucial for investment to drive up mail reliability. Price rises would provide about a third of the finance needed to upgrade mail centres, with the rest coming from increased efficiency.

      "body": "<p>I never met the trumpeter who used to live near me a decade ago. But that sound of methodical practice, drifting across the gardens in the summer, was enhanced by the mystery of its source. It wasn't usually jazz; often it would be classical exercises: rounded, glossy chromatic scales, airy, teasing pirouettes in the upper register, stuttery tonguing routines like morse code. </p> <p>Then Miles Davis went into a coma. It was the summer of 1991. The invisible player's music suddenly changed, to Davis's famous ballad sound of the 1950s, a vivid, personal approximation of his bruised poignancy, his tenderness with timbre, even a little of his graceful swing. And that summer, for months after Davis's final departure in September, trumpeters all over the world were undoubtedly doing the same thing. </p> <p>But if the point about Davis had only been that trumpeters, or other jazz musicians, loved and appreciated his unique sound, he wouldn't have been the colossus of contemporary music he remains - nor the romantic hero he was for so many listeners. </p> <p>Miles Davis is the best-known jazz musician of the past half-century, one of the few to become a household name. His most famous recording, Kind of Blue, has sold steadily for 40 years and still does, in numbers that go way beyond the cognoscenti. Trumpeter, author and educator Ian Carr, Davis's British biographer, recalls a 1980s Davis concert in which fans were reverently touching the superstar's garments, as if celestial bliss would be the next move for him and them alike. Davis inspired awe, respect, sometimes fury and frequently fear. </p> <p>Carr and producer/director Mike Dibb are behind an unprecedented British television jazz profile - a two-and-a-half-hour account of Davis's life and times showing over two nights this weekend that catches his power and inspirational charisma without mystifying the process by which his music was made. </p> <p>Davis, in extensive interviews from the later years, and in those early black-and-white photographs through which he developed an image as the epitome of hip, is examined with a candour unusual for jazz documentaries. Handsome as a bust carved from hardwood and driven for much of his life by an appetite for the edge that gave him ideas, glamour, damaged health and chaotic relationships, Davis was easily bored and so impatient with the familiar that (as Keith Jarrett observes in the film), he would rather have a bad band playing bad music than repeat himself. </p> <p>One of the most fascinating conundrums of his life - that he appeared to be a domineering and egotistical man who was nonetheless one of the most open, experimental and collaborative of artists - is spotlit with rare clarity. Carr and Dibb have managed to expand the complex, contradictory picture of Davis in a manner never attempted before. They have done this by augmenting an A-list of famous former Davis musicians and riveting concert footage with long interviews with several of the women who were influential in the trumpeter's life (including his first girlfriend, Irene Cawthorn, who adds an affectionate, razor-sharp and distinctly un-bedazzled authenticity to the early St Louis years). </p> <p>Carr and Dibb first had the idea 23 years ago, but a combination of mainstream TV indifference to jazz, Davis's long layoff with health problems in the late 1970s and a 10-year moratorium on Davis biopics to prolong the life of an American documentary delayed it until 1996. </p> <p>Carr says the BBC still didn't want it then, but Channel 4 quickly committed itself to a budget appropriate for two and a half hours' duration, unprecedented for a British TV jazz documentary on an individual. The Miles Davis Estate, usually an expensive obstacle course for Davis's chroniclers, presented no difficulties. The late Davis's management, sold on Carr's plan from the start, smoothed the way at every turn. </p> <p>\"Apart from my love of his music as a listener and a player,\" says Carr, \"I've always thought Miles's career was the obvious one to enlist in any attempt to get rid of the patronising, ignorant attitudes still surrounding jazz. He's the only one who ever dared to always do what he wanted to, and everything he did had quality. It wasn't just that he was an innovator: when you listen to Kind of Blue you're not noticing its structural radicalism, you just notice that it's beautiful.\" </p> <p>Carr says that it is Davis's volatile, difficult, and sometimes downright forbidding personality that fascinates many of those interviewing him about the film, and the way it seems to represent the dark side of the extraordinary luminescence of his music. \"I talked to Gil Evans about this,\" Carr says, \"and he would say, 'Don't believe anything you read about Miles Davis, he's a sweet guy.' All right, that doesn't mean he couldn't be very nasty, too, but it was a protection thing. The more sensitive a person is, the more difficult it can be to get rid of things that aren't right, and sometimes you have to be blatantly rude. </p> <p>\"People are always asking me, 'Wasn't he a very selfish man?' I say it's irrelevant. If you want to do something 100%, you have to be focused, maybe selfish, otherwise it just goes off at half-cock. Within his vision, he was often kind. The guitarist John Scofield says that whenever he bawled the band out, he'd always come along later and say something encouraging.\" </p> <p>Among many others, the guitarist John McLaughlin emphasises in the film how important relationships were to Davis's way of making music - Davis's daughter Cheryl goes as far as to say the relationship with music took priority over any other in his life. When Davis drew new constellations of musicians together, eventually young experimenters with little reputation, through whom he was putting his career on the line, he was looking for qualities he knew they had, even if he and they had no clear idea what those were until they flowered in the hothouse of the ensemble. </p> <p>\"McLaughlin pointed out that Miles had such impeccable intuition that when that thing happened he could recognise it at once,\" Carr explains. \"Jazz is a collective activity. It doesn't matter that there isn't a single composer. But to me the real test of a great jazz musician is somebody who learns all the time. Miles Davis did. So did Duke Ellington. In the early 1950s, Miles took his drummer Philly Joe Jones to hear Ahmad Jamal. Jamal had no drummer that day, but his guitarist would hit the wood of the guitar with his thumb every fourth beat. Miles said to Philly Joe, 'You put a rimshot on every fourth beat, it'll swing like a motherfucker.' It became part of that band's special sound. That was typical of him - the antennae were always out.\" </p> <p>Carr's most vivid personal memory of Davis dates back to the first edition of his book, and the 1984 interview he did then formed part of the second edition's considerable expansion. It was a point in Davis's life when his emotional and physical energies were on an upswing, and much of his unnerving inaccessibility was gone. \"I asked him to sign my copy of the book,\" Carr recalls. \"He did a drawing of a head with a trumpet, and wrote, 'To Ian the Great' underneath. Then he said, 'I haven't read it, but my wife has.'\" Carr laughs uproariously. </p> <p>\"I was in Italy last week, giving a lecture about the film, and I played the track Generique from Miles's improvised score for the Louis Malle film Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud. At the end, the audience applauded, as if he'd been there. Because it's just so beautiful, there's so much love and warmth coming out. What a contribution to humanity.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Miles Davis Story is on Channel 4 at 8.05pm on Saturday and 7.10pm on Sunday.</p>",

But if the point about Davis had only been that trumpeters, or other jazz musicians, loved and appreciated his unique sound, he wouldn't have been the colossus of contemporary music he remains - nor the romantic hero he was for so many listeners. Miles Davis is the best-known jazz musician of the past half-century, one of the few to become a household name. His most famous recording, Kind of Blue, has sold steadily for 40 years and still does, in numbers that go way beyond the cognoscenti. Trumpeter, author and educator Ian Carr, Davis's British biographer, recalls a 1980s Davis concert in which fans were reverently touching the superstar's garments, as if celestial bliss would be the next move for him and them alike. Davis inspired awe, respect, sometimes fury and frequently fear. Carr and producer/director Mike Dibb are behind an unprecedented British television jazz profile - a two-and-a-half-hour account of Davis's life and times showing over two nights this weekend that catches his power and inspirational charisma without mystifying the process by which his music was made. Davis, in extensive interviews from the later years, and in those early black-and-white photographs through which he developed an image as the epitome of hip, is examined with a candour unusual for jazz documentaries. Handsome as a bust carved from hardwood and driven for much of his life by an appetite for the edge that gave him ideas, glamour, damaged health and chaotic relationships, Davis was easily bored and so impatient with the familiar that (as Keith Jarrett observes in the film), he would rather have a bad band playing bad music than repeat himself. One of the most fascinating conundrums of his life - that he appeared to be a domineering and egotistical man who was nonetheless one of the most open, experimental and collaborative of artists - is spotlit with rare clarity. Carr and Dibb have managed to expand the complex, contradictory picture of Davis in a manner never attempted before. They have done this by augmenting an A-list of famous former Davis musicians and riveting concert footage with long interviews with several of the women who were influential in the trumpeter's life (including his first girlfriend, Irene Cawthorn, who adds an affectionate, razor-sharp and distinctly un-bedazzled authenticity to the early St Louis years). Carr and Dibb first had the idea 23 years ago, but a combination of mainstream TV indifference to jazz, Davis's long layoff with health problems in the late 1970s and a 10-year moratorium on Davis biopics to prolong the life of an American documentary delayed it until 1996. Carr says the BBC still didn't want it then, but Channel 4 quickly committed itself to a budget appropriate for two and a half hours' duration, unprecedented for a British TV jazz documentary on an individual. The Miles Davis Estate, usually an expensive obstacle course for Davis's chroniclers, presented no difficulties. The late Davis's management, sold on Carr's plan from the start, smoothed the way at every turn. \"Apart from my love of his music as a listener and a player,\" says Carr, \"I've always thought Miles's career was the obvious one to enlist in any attempt to get rid of the patronising, ignorant attitudes still surrounding jazz. He's the only one who ever dared to always do what he wanted to, and everything he did had quality. It wasn't just that he was an innovator: when you listen to Kind of Blue you're not noticing its structural radicalism, you just notice that it's beautiful.\" Carr says that it is Davis's volatile, difficult, and sometimes downright forbidding personality that fascinates many of those interviewing him about the film, and the way it seems to represent the dark side of the extraordinary luminescence of his music. \"I talked to Gil Evans about this,\" Carr says, \"and he would say, 'Don't believe anything you read about Miles Davis, he's a sweet guy.' All right, that doesn't mean he couldn't be very nasty, too, but it was a protection thing. The more sensitive a person is, the more difficult it can be to get rid of things that aren't right, and sometimes you have to be blatantly rude. \"People are always asking me, 'Wasn't he a very selfish man?' I say it's irrelevant. If you want to do something 100%, you have to be focused, maybe selfish, otherwise it just goes off at half-cock. Within his vision, he was often kind. The guitarist John Scofield says that whenever he bawled the band out, he'd always come along later and say something encouraging.\" Among many others, the guitarist John McLaughlin emphasises in the film how important relationships were to Davis's way of making music - Davis's daughter Cheryl goes as far as to say the relationship with music took priority over any other in his life. When Davis drew new constellations of musicians together, eventually young experimenters with little reputation, through whom he was putting his career on the line, he was looking for qualities he knew they had, even if he and they had no clear idea what those were until they flowered in the hothouse of the ensemble. \"McLaughlin pointed out that Miles had such impeccable intuition that when that thing happened he could recognise it at once,\" Carr explains. \"Jazz is a collective activity. It doesn't matter that there isn't a single composer. But to me the real test of a great jazz musician is somebody who learns all the time. Miles Davis did. So did Duke Ellington. In the early 1950s, Miles took his drummer Philly Joe Jones to hear Ahmad Jamal. Jamal had no drummer that day, but his guitarist would hit the wood of the guitar with his thumb every fourth beat. Miles said to Philly Joe, 'You put a rimshot on every fourth beat, it'll swing like a motherfucker.' It became part of that band's special sound. That was typical of him - the antennae were always out.\" Carr's most vivid personal memory of Davis dates back to the first edition of his book, and the 1984 interview he did then formed part of the second edition's considerable expansion. It was a point in Davis's life when his emotional and physical energies were on an upswing, and much of his unnerving inaccessibility was gone. \"I asked him to sign my copy of the book,\" Carr recalls. \"He did a drawing of a head with a trumpet, and wrote, 'To Ian the Great' underneath. Then he said, 'I haven't read it, but my wife has.'\" Carr laughs uproariously. \"I was in Italy last week, giving a lecture about the film, and I played the track Generique from Miles's improvised score for the Louis Malle film Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud. At the end, the audience applauded, as if he'd been there. Because it's just so beautiful, there's so much love and warmth coming out. What a contribution to humanity.\" \u0095 The Miles Davis Story is on Channel 4 at 8.05pm on Saturday and 7.10pm on Sunday.",

Who the hell was gonna come for us in the middle of the goddamn night?

In 1992 they went to Brazil. </p> <p>\"That was the turning point. I saw 30,000 people who didn't speak English singing along with his version of Wild World and I knew that's what I wanted.

The more negative you talk about Shaggy, the more I'm driven to prove you wrong. I had to make a record that was not only bigger than Oh Carolina but one I wrote myself. It was never a problem because I knew I was making musical history.\" </p> <p>Two and a half years after Oh Carolina, Boombastic, helped by a jeans advertisement, reached number one in Britain. In America the album of the same name won a Grammy for the best reggae album and sold a million copies. Even so, in late 1997 Shaggy found himself without a label. \"I received a letter saying I was not on Virgin any more.

The word spread and soon it was an American number one, receiving a record 8,000 radio plays in one week. In Britain, six years after Boombastic, It Wasn't Me became Shaggy's third chart topper. Hot Shot has been relaunched and another American number one, Angel is yet to come. This time, surely, there will be no calamity. \"I'll stay around.

There have been rumours of over-zealous management (\"My manager is a product of the streets, as I am, but he's not Mafia- or don-connected. He's just a stern person and a very good businessman\") and suggestions of a casual attitude towards women. \"Shaggy makes making-baby music,\" he claims, \"but I set a good sexual example. I don't sing about safe sex because that should be second nature. It's like going on the telephone. You can't communicate without a cellphone nowadays; you can't have sex without a condom.

There could be no bigger compliment than saying you're my angel.\" </p> <p>He looks to the future with confidence. \"Everything is in my favour now.

      "bodyText": "The Russian police are investigating how 54 corpses and 440 brains were removed from a medical school in Siberia and illegally transported to a controversial embalming institute in Germany. There is concern that some of the bodies from the Novosibirsk medical academy may have ended up as human sculptures in a German anatomist's exhibition of preserved corpses in Berlin. Gunther von Hagens' Bodyworld exhibition comprises dead bodies that have been skinned, dissected and positioned in lifelike poses. They are preserved using his \"plastination\" technique, in which body fluids are replaced by synthetic resins. The removed Russian corpses and limbs are believed to belong to prisoners and homeless and mentally ill Russians whose remains were unclaimed after they died. The Siberian serious crimes division was alerted to the case when customs officials noticed a load of human remains being exported in suspicious circumstances late last year. The police discovered that there had been regular shipments of apparently unwanted human remains from the city's medical academy to Professor Hagens' Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg since 1999. The directors of 14 medical organisations in the city, including psychiatric hospitals and retirement homes, are under investigation. No charges have been brought so far. Anatoly Efremov, director of the medical school, said that his institute was taking part in research into the embalming techniques used in the Heidelberg institute. Under Russian law, unclaimed corpses can be used for medical research. Professor von Hagens says all the corpses are awaiting plastination in his Heidelberg centre, and he denies breaking the law. \"They were fixed with formaldehyde and had already been classed as anatomical specimens,\" he said. \"Adhering to my policy that I should never receive money for specimens, no money changed hands, and I only paid for the shipment costs.\" Novosibirsk residents were dismayed by a television report about the Bodyworld exhibition broadcast earlier this week. Tattoos in cyrillic script were clearly visible on one of the exhibits. Professor von Hagens said there were no Russian bodies in his exhibition, and that the tattooed body belonged to a German citizen, whom he had known personally. He conceded that the scandal aroused by the Russian bodies was damaging. \"If this continues, I'm seri ously considering sending the bodies back,\" he said. A bit of controversy is good for my exhibition, but not anything that damages the reputation of anatomy.\" The Novosibirsk police are trying to uncover the nature of the agreement signed by the city's medical school and the Plastination Institute. Representatives of all the medical institutes under investigation have denied breaking the law, but have refused to make any further comment. \"We are investigating the role played by the director of the medical school, which violated federal law on burial,\" a spokeswoman for the Novosibirsk prosecutors' office, Natalya Markassova, said yesterday. Professor von Hagens invented plastination 20 years ago, replacing bodily fluids with silicone after death to preserve the corpses in a lifelike way. Since the late 1990s he has displayed his plastinated specimens, including foetuses, pregnant women, and a horse, in the Bodyworld exhibition. The exhibition is due to move to London early next year. It has already toured Germany, Japan and Austria. The professor says that all the bodies in the exhibition were donated, and that 3,600 people have signed away their bodies to be plastinated after death. The illegal trade in human organs is a growing problem in Russia. Last year investigators in Siberia opened a criminal case against a forensic expert accused of stealing more than 1,000 pituitary glands from corpses and selling them abroad; the gland produces growth hormone and can be used in the treatment of people with growth defects. A grandmother was arrested in southern Russia in October as she tried to sell her five-year-old grandson to a man who planned to take him to the west to have key organs removed and sold.",

Thousands of protesters clashed with the police and more than 200 were injured yesterday at a rally in the main square to demand the resignation of the government, blamed by many for Turkey's financial crisis. The police fired in the air and used water cannon and teargas to break up the crowd of more than 70,000 after some demonstrators threw stones, bricks and pieces of wood at them, and tore up large paving stones for barricades.

You're not in Teachers now. </p> <p>What we have here are two hospital dramas, <strong> A &amp; E</strong> (ITV) and <strong> ER</strong> (Channel 4). Try not to confuse the two. And try to get out of the way fast as the trolleys thunder through. </p> <p>A &amp; E - formerly known as Always And Everyone but that made things too easy - has an entertaining double act in Michael Kitchen and Martin Shaw, playing surgeons. Two serious actors though, of course, not at their most serious here. Shaw gazes benevolently over his spectacles and Kitchen twinkles wickedly over his mask. As Lord Olivier used to say, \"It's all in the eyes, dear boy.\" Admire their acting as they both pretend to smoke. It takes years to perfect that sort of aplomb. </p> <p>Actresses in flight from soaps seem to drift into nursing so, for our younger viewers, there is the arrival of Leanne Battersby from Coronation Street (Jane Danson) as the sort of nurse who makes you feel nervous. </p> <p>ER is a superior product. It is American and it helps if you can appreciate Dr Greene's Dr Seuss joke as he makes breakfast (\"Greene's eggs and ham\") or understand the crucial difference, in terms of falling down in the street, between Thanksgiving turkey and Wild Turkey. The writers don't seem quite as clued up about Britain as they might be. Dr Corday, played by British actress Alex Kingston, was having an uncomfortable meeting with the hospital manager. She confided that a paralysed patient was suing her for malpractice. He confided right back, \"When his lawyers get through with you, you'll be lucky if you're slinging fish and chips back in England.\" Saying which, he crunched a handful of pills like peanuts and pushed off. But then he had a blonde waiting. </p> <p>This gave me such pause for thought that I lost several yards of the plot. I know it is traditionally American to sling hash, whatever hash may be. Perhaps you can also sling a hamburger, skimming it like a frisbee from pan to plate. But fish and chips are, I would suggest, virtually impossible to sling. Admittedly, in Coronation Street this week Eileen Grimshaw threw three bags of chips at Dennis, her lodger-cum-lover, and hit the target every time, but personally I would describe her action more as a slow leg break. </p> <p>This ER was a Thanksgiving episode and we can only be grateful over here that we have nothing to be thankful for. Dr Greene discovered he has a brain tumour, Dr Corday found out she was pregnant, you couldn't move for mothers, and the weather was just terrible. Oh, and the hospital exploded, like an acetylene torch, in tongues of fire. It is symptomatic of the pace and noise of ER that you'd forget a little thing like that. </p> <p>On balance, I would rather go into <strong> Animal Hospital</strong> (BBC 1) than either A &amp; E or ER. There is, admittedly, the risk of being neutered, but there is also Rolf Harris, ever on hand, who will call me a good girl and stroke my bottom. </p> <p>One man brought in a sick puppy. \"I said I'll never have another bitch. I had my last bitch for 14 years. That were the hardest day of my life wi' no doubt because we'd done everything together that bitch and me. But this one comes along and you can't resist 'em.\" You will be pleased to hear his puppy pulled through. There is more love going begging here than in most TV dramas. </p> <p>Except <strong> The Cops</strong> (BBC 2). The exceptional Cops is the exception to everything. In this episode three people are half mad with love and loss, two of them policemen. Roy (John Henshaw), whose wife has died, is stunned but still standing like a poleaxed ox. When Shona, a deranged girl, stabs her rival screaming, \"She's dead!\", the words bounce off his big, bemused, bereaved face. Colin's wife has, rather understandably, left him. I was, I fear, very tickled by Colin's complaint, \"I joined this job for the camaraderie but no fucker likes me.\" </p> <p>The Cops, which carries the unmistakable hallmark of Tony Garnett, has won two Bafta awards. It looks like life, true but untidy. The acting is different in quality from anything else on TV. Sometimes it hurt to look. </p> <p>The BBC has cancelled The Cops. As Mel (Katy Cavanagh) put it in the last words of the last programme, \"Enough said\". </p> <p> \"Irene, goodnight. Goodnight. I'll see you in my dreams.\" </p> <p>On hearing Nyree Dawn Porter was dead.</p>",

Oh, and the hospital exploded, like an acetylene torch, in tongues of fire. It is symptomatic of the pace and noise of ER that you'd forget a little thing like that. On balance, I would rather go into Animal Hospital (BBC 1) than either A &amp; E or ER. There is, admittedly, the risk of being neutered, but there is also Rolf Harris, ever on hand, who will call me a good girl and stroke my bottom. One man brought in a sick puppy. \"I said I'll never have another bitch. I had my last bitch for 14 years. That were the hardest day of my life wi' no doubt because we'd done everything together that bitch and me. But this one comes along and you can't resist 'em.\" You will be pleased to hear his puppy pulled through. There is more love going begging here than in most TV dramas. Except The Cops (BBC 2). The exceptional Cops is the exception to everything. In this episode three people are half mad with love and loss, two of them policemen. Roy (John Henshaw), whose wife has died, is stunned but still standing like a poleaxed ox. When Shona, a deranged girl, stabs her rival screaming, \"She's dead!\", the words bounce off his big, bemused, bereaved face. Colin's wife has, rather understandably, left him. I was, I fear, very tickled by Colin's complaint, \"I joined this job for the camaraderie but no fucker likes me.\" The Cops, which carries the unmistakable hallmark of Tony Garnett, has won two Bafta awards. It looks like life, true but untidy. The acting is different in quality from anything else on TV. Sometimes it hurt to look. The BBC has cancelled The Cops. As Mel (Katy Cavanagh) put it in the last words of the last programme, \"Enough said\". \"Irene, goodnight. Goodnight. I'll see you in my dreams.\" On hearing Nyree Dawn Porter was dead.",

By turning off appliances, rather than having them on standby, the nation could save 14bn kilowatt hours: roughly the annual electricity consumption of Berlin. Households could save up to a third - 61m tonnes of carbon dioxide - by actions such as not opening the windows when the central heating is on. If all the right things were done, then by 2005 the nation could be 25% down on 1990 emissions. \"A nice thought,\" said the Fraunhofer scientist Edelgard Gruber, \"but unfortunately a long way from reality.\" </p> <p><strong> Tick that took its time to talk </strong><br> It dropped into a globule of resin 90 million years ago.

By turning off appliances, rather than having them on standby, the nation could save 14bn kilowatt hours: roughly the annual electricity consumption of Berlin. Households could save up to a third - 61m tonnes of carbon dioxide - by actions such as not opening the windows when the central heating is on. If all the right things were done, then by 2005 the nation could be 25% down on 1990 emissions. \"A nice thought,\" said the Fraunhofer scientist Edelgard Gruber, \"but unfortunately a long way from reality.\" Tick that took its time to talk It dropped into a globule of resin 90 million years ago.

Even today, physicists echo ancient creation myths by speaking of the universe hatching from a \"cosmic egg\". </p> <p>Pliny the Elder (rated by one modern scholar as that \"voluminous, industrious, unphilosophical, gullible, unsystematic old gossip\") had much to say about eggs. In his Natural History he gives an account of a magical egg laid by serpents. Every year, in summer, Pliny wrote, it is possible to witness an egg formed from the saliva and sweat of a writhing mass of intertwined snakes. The egg squirts out of the knot like a ball out of a rugby scrum - \"the serpents when they have thus engendered this egg do cast it up on high into the aire by the force of their hissing, which being observed, there must be one ready to catch and receive it in the fall again.\" </p> <p>Such a fortunate fly-half must, indeed, fly - on horseback, for fear of pursuit by the angry snakes, who can only be stopped by a body of water. The egg, however, if dropped, \"will swim aloft above the water even against the stream, yea though it were bound and enchased with a plate of gold\". Joseph Needham who quoted this passage in his History of Embryology (1934) notes that one must not be too hard on Pliny and his 17th-century translator Philemon Holland, for what they lack in veracity is more than matched by their entertainment value. </p> <p>As Philemon Holland strove to give us the wisdom of the ancients, the physician William Harvey, known for discovering the circulation of the blood, was looking to the future. In 1651 he published Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium (On the Generation of Animals). In it, Harvey declared that all animals started out as tiny primordia, or \"ova\" - eggs. </p> <p>Whereas it is true that Harvey's famous slogan \"Omne vivum ex ovo\" (all life comes from the egg) was as much written by Harvey as \"Play It Again, Sam\" ever issued from the lips of Humphrey Bogart, the title pages of the first two of the four 1651 editions of Exercitationes showed an enthroned Zeus holding an egg at the point of hatching an entire bestiary. On the egg is written \"Ex Ovo, Omnia.\" </p> <p>And so the slogan ran down the ages. (What Harvey actually wrote was \"Ovum esse primordium commune omnibus animalibus\", but this doesn't have quite the same ring.) Exercitationes, written in the age of Newton, was one of the first demonstrations of modern scientific method. As such, it deserves its place in the canon of scientific literature as perhaps the greatest advance in embryology since Aristotle's own work On The Generation of Animals, written in 4BC. It deserves its place even more because it was unashamedly and (almost) completely wrong. And scientists who so can didly admit error are the finest scientists of all. </p> <p>Like Harvey, Aristotle was no vain theoriser. He dissected the eggs of chickens at various stages of development, noting the growth and differentiation of the embryo. So much for what Aristotle classed as oviparous - egg-bearing - creatures such as birds. What about viviparous creatures, with the capacity for live birth? Aristotle viewed the two processes as quite different. Following immemorial tradition, he held that viviparous creatures, including humans, developed when - and there is no delicate way to say this - semen interacted with a clot of menstrual blood in the uterus. Old wives of all nations knew that menstruation stopped during pregnancy, so this seemed like a reasonable conclusion, but Aristotle never tested the proposition of vivipary. Aside from a hopefully apocryphal story in which Cleopatra is said to have ordered the execution of pregnant female slaves at various times to assess embryological development, this test was to wait almost 2,000 years: until Harvey was able to dissect recently mated does culled from the deer parks of his patron, King Charles I. Examining the uterus, he found no trace of semen, or blood - in fact, nothing whatsoever. Aristotle was wrong, but how could his theory be replaced? If not semen and blood, what? Further investigations, on animals mated some time before and left to gestate, revealed early embryos, apparently formless sacs whose origin was a mystery. At the end, Harvey confessed himself stumped. </p> <p>Only much later, with the help of microscopes and the cell theory, were scientists able to elaborate on Harvey's work. Harvey's triumph lay in his realisation that Aristotle's ovipary and vivipary were one and the same. Without any idea of the cell theory, and only a hand-lens at best, Harvey came up with the concept of the ovum as a vital \"primordium\" which encom passed the eggs of hens, as well as the embryos he saw in the uteri of dissected deer. </p> <p>Both were destined to grow into adults, nourished by the mother - whether directly, in the uterus, or remotely, by the yolk of a new-laid egg. Harvey would never have been able to have spotted the actual ovum of a human being without a microscope - that discovery had to wait until 1826 - but his central idea, that life came from the egg, was the foundation stone of modern biology. But what everyone really wants to know is the answer to the age-old conundrum of which came first, the egg or the chicken? The answer to that can be found in Plutarch, again brought to the vernacular by the egregious Philemon Holland. </p> <p>Plutarch wrote that he \"absteined from eating egges, by reason of a certaine dream I had_ that I believed [the egg] to be the principle and fountaine of generation.\" In the subsequent exegesis, Plutarch writes that of all creatures, \"there is not in manner one, I dare well say, exempt from being engendered of an egge.\" </p> <p>He continues, \"Not without great reason therefore is it consecrated to the sacred ceremonies and mysteries of Bacchus as representing that nature which produceth and comprehendeth in itself all things.\" Omne vivum ex ovo - play it again, William.

      "body": "<p>Young Irish farmer Noel Marshall could have given a masterclass in sales skills to any one of the hundreds of inventors in the hall. By his own admission he was a beginner at this business. But, having somehow secured one of the most prominent stands at the International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva last week, the 25-year-old's sales patter for his invention - the Bricky - was flowing thick and fast. In fact, with Noel's southern Irish accent it was probably a little too thick and a little too fast for much of his multinational audience, but his message was clear. My simple little device helps you lay bricks fast - really fast - the profit margins are gonna be huge, and I want to sell the idea to you. </p> <p>Noel was one of a record 725 exhibitors showing off inventions at this annual gathering in Geneva, which claims to be the biggest show devoted to brand-new inventions anywhere in the world. It is held at the Palexpo Convention Centre, near the border with France and less than 10 minutes' drive from Cern, the particle physics lab where scientists routinely create antimatter, and someone called Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web a few years ago. </p> <p>There was, of course, nothing at this show which could quite live up to that local heritage, but there was plenty to gawk at, from the highly specialised to the bizarre, from the beautiful to the strictly functional. To be allowed in, each exhibit had to have come into the public domain in the past year, and be patented. And, you quickly learned from every stallholder you spoke to, each exhibit represented a dream. </p> <p>\"I'm here because I know there's a lot of money to be made from this,\" says Marshall during a quiet moment at his booth, which has been transformed from dowdy cubicle to a little corner of the emerald isle, with flags, local newspaper cuttings, hurling sticks and a giant poster of his beloved Cork hurling team for which his brother plays. </p> <p>The idea he is out to promote is so beguilingly simple, you wonder why it has not been invented before. Indeed, part of Noel's patter is that \"this should have been invented a hundred years ago\". </p> <p>The Bricky is a mould which is placed on top of a row of bricks, into which the bricklayer puts the next layer of mortar. The mould gives a perfect depth and dimensions, and the next row of bricks can be quickly added. </p> <p>Noel says he got the idea on December 27 last year, when he was trying to build an outhouse on his farm, and was \"making a right dog's dinner of it\". Now, he claims, bricklaying chums are able to work twice as fast. </p> <p>\"I'm not sure what I want to do with the idea,\" he says. \"I might sell the rights, but only with commission, mind - I want a cut.\" He has banded together with his neighbour, Donnie Dennine, who he says is the marketing man - although he looks like he barely has need for one. Have you had any offers yet, I ask? \"Oh yes,\" he says, without hesitation. \"A million.\" </p> <p>I don't believe him, although doubtless that's his target, and in pounds rather than lira. </p> <p>Things are rather quieter a couple of aisles away in the tiny British enclave, tucked away among vast sections populated by inventors from Taiwan and eastern Europe. </p> <p>Charles Brown is one of the handful of exhibitors to have crossed the Channel - he is here to show off his specialised metal grinder, which creates tiny metal shards from recycled metal useful for various industrial processes. He hopes to export his machine, made by a company in his native Sheffield, to continental customers. </p> <p>\"Why are there so few British exhibitors,\" I ask him. \"Do they all go elsewhere to show their wares?\" \"No, no. It's just our amazing insularity,\" he says. \"Something to do with the fall of the empire,\" he chuckles. Brown says it is a long-standing problem that he has noticed over his four decades doing the rounds. \"That's what went wrong with the Sheffield steel industry in my view,\" he says. \"They just didn't get overseas and visit their customers.\" </p> <p>Insularity is also a word used by the assistant director of the show, Ann Loertscher, explaining the absence of any organised British presence. \"For years I have been trying to get the department of trade and industry involved,\" she says, apparently mystified by the British intransigence. \"We have been trying to tell them it is going to bring in foreign currency. And if they came they would be able to meet the French, the Germans, the Russians, and exchange ideas.\" </p> <p>Today, she says, the Russians - celebrating their fifth year here - are the model delegation for every one of the 40 countries exhibiting. \"They are supported by the ministry of technology and science, and the ministry of emergency situations, and they select who travels here according to their budget. The first year things were not so good, but since then they have made enormous progress,\" she says. </p> <p> The inventions in the Russian section are certainly varied. There are new lubricants and welding processes, as well as inventions we might expect from the country, such as improvements to the process of drilling through perma-frost rocks and new ways to construct sturdier buildings on frozen ground. There is also the eccentric, including a double-strap device that holds an umbrella in place without the use of hands. </p> <p>Indeed, that's the kind of eccentricity which many might expect from such a show, especially those weaned on the Great Egg Race. In the 80s TV programme, Lesley Judd and Professor Heinz Wolff presided over teams with inventions such as Flymos converted into remote-control hovercraft using only equipment found in a \"typical\" garage. </p> <p>Mere mention of inventors' wild-haired, bad-jumpered reputations raises assistant director Loertscher's heckles. \"Please don't say that,\" she says, firmly, before launching into what is clearly a well-rehearsed statement for the media on Why Inventors Might Be Eccentric, But Deserve Our Respect. </p> <p>\"Most of these inventors have day jobs and create in their free time,\" she says. \"They might be developing a new cup for use in transport, or the highest technology thing imaginable, but they all deserve our respect. </p> <p>\"It is just that some spend all their time working on their inventions - the apples of their eyes - and struggle to explain their creations.\" </p> <p>Some might, but not all. Back in the British enclave, another inventor is hard- selling his dream. Alan McGowan, an irrepressible Yorkshireman smartly dressed in a shirt which shows off his tatoos, has what he reckons is \"the monster of the show\": a 12-foot high hole-blasting device which uses compressed air and water rather than explosives for mining. </p> <p>McGowan says his device could slash mining costs and save lives - not just of miners unlucky with sticks of dynamite, but in third world countries where it could be used to re-open dried up wells. Oh, and it could make him rich, too. </p> <p>\"ICI makes hundreds of millions a year from explosives, and there are 53 manufacturers of explosives in the world,\" he says. \"This is cheaper - it cuts the cost of a 60ft hole from $44 to $4, and it's safer. They'll ban explosives when this goes on sale.\" </p> <p>That, like our slick Irishman's million, might be just another dream. </p> <p>But, even if their inventions failed to pass muster, that ambition alone makes the show an appropriate neighbour to the earth- shattering, atom-splitting laboratories of Cern. </p> <p><strong>From brilliant to the bizarre</strong></p> <p>Such was the sales pitch of Noel Marshall, inventor of the Bricky, that he managed to pick up the popular vote for best invention. </p> <p>Jean-Pierre Sigrist, a director of the exhibition, presented Noel with his prize at the the show's annual awards ceremony on Friday night. </p> <p>The evening was a celebration of the best of the show's offerings, all of which have to be brand new and patented to gain entry. </p> <p>Winner of the Grand Prix prize - voted for by a 68-member jury and regarded as the most prestigious prize, even without a cash reward - was a Spanish plant pot. Its inventor claims it can cut up to three months off regular growth times for plant cuttings. </p> <p>Jose-Luis Lleo Faura has already sold 23,000 Rooter Pots ahead of its official launch. </p> <p>Also given an award was Swiss inventor Hanspeter Steffen who had created a new packaging for keeping food fresh, and Russian exhibitor Marina Bludyan who had developed a sophisticated protective mask. </p> <p>Water Gate, a flexible water-filled barrier for containing floods and toxic spills developed by a Canadian team, also picked up several awards. </p> <p>But not all inventions met with such acclaim. Professor Giuseppe Cirillo, founder of a Rome-based school of courtship and seduction, was still struggling to sell the concept of Chastity Pants.

      "body": "<p>Newsgroups are the internet's talking shop. Whatever you like to talk about, there is probably a group for it, somewhere between alt.abortion and zipnews.gov.world.politics. If not, you can start one. </p> <p>Although they are called \"newsgroups\", there is rarely any news in them. Content is made up of email messages or \"postings\" from anyone who can be bothered to send them. The stream of messages is passed from server to server as a \"newsfeed\". New postings replace old ones, which eventually disappear. </p> <p>To participate, you need a program called a newsreader. One of the best known is Agent, which is also available in a free version, <a href=\"http://www.forteinc.com\">Free Agent</a>. However, a serviceable newsreader is included free with browsers such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, so these are what most people use. </p> <p>Outlook Express - which is part of Internet Explorer - treats news exactly the same as email. If you can send and receive email, then you can handle Usenet newsgroups, too. </p> <p>The first job is to establish a connection to a news server. This will probably be the one run by your ISP (internet service provider), though there are also public (free) and paid-for alternatives. The only thing you need to know is the address, which will be something like news.btclick.com </p> <p>To set up news in Outlook Express, go to Tools and select Accounts from the pull-down menu. When the tabbed dialogue box appears, click on Add in the top right hand corner, and select News. This will start a wizard to take you through the process. Just fill in your name and email address (or accept the ones offered) and type in the address of the news server. </p> <p>It is a good idea to set up a separate mailbox on Yahoo or Hotmail for newsgroup use only, in case you are deluged with spam (junk email). If you want to do this later, go back to the dialogue box and click on the News tab, then click the button on the right for Properties. </p> <p>When you close the dialogue box, you will be asked if you want to download newsgroups. Say yes. There are tens of thousands, so this may take some time. When the list appears, you can choose which you want to subscribe to. This is done by highlighting each group and clicking the Subscribe button on the right. Press OK to finish, and the names will be added to the Folders section below your mailboxes. </p> <p>If you want to add groups later, select Tools|Newsgroups or press Ctrl-W. This will bring up the list of groups that has already been downloaded and saved on your hard drive. </p> <p>To control each newsgroup, right-click on its name and select Properties.Click on the Synchronize tab to select what you want fetching, and click on the Local File tab to delete messages you no longer want. </p> <p>The Synchronize tab lets you download just the headers of messages, or whole messages (headers and bodies). With low volume newsgroups, you may as well download the whole lot. With high volume and binary newsgroups, it is best to download only the headers.

      "bodyText": "Newsgroups are the internet's talking shop. Whatever you like to talk about, there is probably a group for it, somewhere between alt.abortion and zipnews.gov.world.politics. If not, you can start one. Although they are called \"newsgroups\", there is rarely any news in them. Content is made up of email messages or \"postings\" from anyone who can be bothered to send them. The stream of messages is passed from server to server as a \"newsfeed\". New postings replace old ones, which eventually disappear. To participate, you need a program called a newsreader. One of the best known is Agent, which is also available in a free version, Free Agent. However, a serviceable newsreader is included free with browsers such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, so these are what most people use. Outlook Express - which is part of Internet Explorer - treats news exactly the same as email. If you can send and receive email, then you can handle Usenet newsgroups, too. The first job is to establish a connection to a news server. This will probably be the one run by your ISP (internet service provider), though there are also public (free) and paid-for alternatives. The only thing you need to know is the address, which will be something like news.btclick.com To set up news in Outlook Express, go to Tools and select Accounts from the pull-down menu. When the tabbed dialogue box appears, click on Add in the top right hand corner, and select News. This will start a wizard to take you through the process. Just fill in your name and email address (or accept the ones offered) and type in the address of the news server. It is a good idea to set up a separate mailbox on Yahoo or Hotmail for newsgroup use only, in case you are deluged with spam (junk email). If you want to do this later, go back to the dialogue box and click on the News tab, then click the button on the right for Properties. When you close the dialogue box, you will be asked if you want to download newsgroups. Say yes. There are tens of thousands, so this may take some time. When the list appears, you can choose which you want to subscribe to. This is done by highlighting each group and clicking the Subscribe button on the right. Press OK to finish, and the names will be added to the Folders section below your mailboxes. If you want to add groups later, select Tools|Newsgroups or press Ctrl-W. This will bring up the list of groups that has already been downloaded and saved on your hard drive. To control each newsgroup, right-click on its name and select Properties.Click on the Synchronize tab to select what you want fetching, and click on the Local File tab to delete messages you no longer want. The Synchronize tab lets you download just the headers of messages, or whole messages (headers and bodies). With low volume newsgroups, you may as well download the whole lot. With high volume and binary newsgroups, it is best to download only the headers. You can then scan them offline, and decide which ones to mark for downloading later. \"Binary\" newsgroups are the ones where large files are posted, often in multiple messages. Examples include alt.binaries.doom and comp.binaries.ibm. The large files may be computer programs, MP3s, pictures or video clips. Not all of them are pirate software or pornography, but many are. Next, select the newsgroup folder (eg news. btclick.com) in Folders, and Internet Explorer's right hand pane will show your list of newsgroups and three buttons.

      "body": "<p>Nyree Dawn Porter, who has died aged 61, became a star when she was one of the popular television players used by the producer Donald Wilson to persuade a reluctant BBC to make The Forsyte Saga, the memorable 1967 series created from the novels of John Galsworthy attacking the dominance of property over humanity. The series won an audience of over 100m in 26 countries.</p> <p>Porter's classical good looks, slightly wan and other-worldly, were ideal for the part of Irene Forsyte, wife of the cold \"man of property\" Soames Forsyte, played by Eric Porter (no relation). Her looks became known world wide, so that for years she received often demented fan mail from people who either thought that the cold and property-conscious Soames should have been hanged, drawn and quartered for raping his beautiful but frigid wife, or sympathised with him on the grounds that Irene was herself a cold and irritating bitch.</p> <p>The formidable cast with whom she had to play also included the film star Kenneth More, who was temporarily in a career limbo at the age of 50. He played Jolyon Forsyte, cousin of Soames, who in the end runs off with the Nyree Dawn Porter character.</p> <p>The series, in which the character of Irene was made pivotal, nearly did not get made. Donald Wilson had been keen on Galsworthy's novels since 1928 and had been seeking the film rights, owned by MGM, for 11 years. But Sydney Newman, head of BBC drama, was doubtful whether a \"costume\" piece would appeal to popular taste in the Swinging 60s.

      "bodyText": "Nyree Dawn Porter, who has died aged 61, became a star when she was one of the popular television players used by the producer Donald Wilson to persuade a reluctant BBC to make The Forsyte Saga, the memorable 1967 series created from the novels of John Galsworthy attacking the dominance of property over humanity. The series won an audience of over 100m in 26 countries. Porter's classical good looks, slightly wan and other-worldly, were ideal for the part of Irene Forsyte, wife of the cold \"man of property\" Soames Forsyte, played by Eric Porter (no relation). Her looks became known world wide, so that for years she received often demented fan mail from people who either thought that the cold and property-conscious Soames should have been hanged, drawn and quartered for raping his beautiful but frigid wife, or sympathised with him on the grounds that Irene was herself a cold and irritating bitch. The formidable cast with whom she had to play also included the film star Kenneth More, who was temporarily in a career limbo at the age of 50. He played Jolyon Forsyte, cousin of Soames, who in the end runs off with the Nyree Dawn Porter character. The series, in which the character of Irene was made pivotal, nearly did not get made. Donald Wilson had been keen on Galsworthy's novels since 1928 and had been seeking the film rights, owned by MGM, for 11 years. But Sydney Newman, head of BBC drama, was doubtful whether a \"costume\" piece would appeal to popular taste in the Swinging 60s. Others were equally doubtful - even if such a series were to be made - whether two people both called Porter could star in it. In the end the actress got her big chance because of BBC politics. The 26 episodes that were broadcast in 1967, the centenary of Galsworthy's birth, were deliberately used by the corporation to boost public interest in BBC2, which had been launched three years previously and was still not popular because the necessary re-tuning of sets was expensive. BBC2 needed a big bold project and the series which made Nyree Dawn Porter's name was the most expensive BBC drama project to date at \u00a3250,000.

The final irony is that when she arrived in Britain from New Zealand at the very start of the 1960s, no television service existed in New Zealand and she had never seen a television set. \u0095 Nyree Dawn Porter, actress, born January 22 1940; died April 10 2001",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Does sex get better as you get older? It's such a funny question. I didn't ask women such questions when I was young. Didn't need to. It was obvious to me that after your 40th birthday, you couldn't possibly swing down the street whistling The Best is Yet to Come. Presuming you could whistle.</p> <p>Pre-40, I was too busy with low moaning, heavy breathing and even heavier conversation. Love, sex and romance were inextricably intertwined and it was all a very serious business. You had to get your show on the road. However sharp my memories, filed away with much emotion, I don't think I properly inhabited the present or abandoned myself to love affairs. My report card would have said: \"Could have tried harder.\" But I was too insecure.</p> <p>Well, maybe occasionally I did let go and lighten up. But it was rare. You lived for the future when it would all work out. Or maybe, I thought, you would reach a kind of plateau where you could heave yourself up and relax.</p> <p>Good sex? Sometimes achingly good. Outrageously exciting. I have few grumbles about men and sex. Once or twice it so touched my soul that tears trickled down my cheeks because I knew this couldn't last. However good, it seemed to be tinged with sadness. OK, so I read a lot of Ana\u00efs Nin in those days, I admit it. Her line about women feeling a little lonelier after sex seemed to strike a chord. I was looking, we were all looking, for the Real Thing.</p> <p>I fell in love, or what felt like love at the time, and it was - lovely. By 24, I was beginning to feel attractive. My body was good, I tanned easily, I went in at the waist, had skinny legs, long hair and large breasts. Trouble was, half of London looked like that only better. So though I passed muster, I was not brimming with confidence.</p> <p>Friends were getting married, having kids, and that was a veil past which I couldn't see. Who the hell knew about their sex lives? I didn't have much faith in the excitement of the marital bed and there were no reports from the front. You learn about married sex much later.</p> <p>Women I knew had married for a number of reasons: because they were even more insecure than me, getting panicky, had stumbled on what their mothers thought of as \"a good catch\", or simply figured time was running out. A few were tenderly, enviably in love. Very few. Lots did want children \"one day\". Some young and pretty ones were plucked by older, dominating men.</p> <p>I couldn't even grasp the fact that men asked you out or found you remotely desirable after 40. The assumption was that life was pretty desperate for a woman as you aged. Nova magazine did a cover story on Brigitte Bardot entitled: \"How it feels to be a sex symbol at 35.\" Life was tough at 35. Not as free, easy, fun-loving and wantonly carnal as in her St Tropez youth.</p> <p>It's a wonder you survive the love/sex/romance pressure of youth, and sometimes you don't. Fiona, a trust-fund friend with a colossal sense of humour and awful taste in men, used to advise me how to run my love life. She was the only person I knew seeing a shrink. We'd tried everything to make our latest relationships work when she said one day that she had found a new, foolproof tactic. \"You become incredibly cheerful,\" she said. \"And you stop asking men questions.\"</p> <p>Well, it's true, we had tried everything else. Give or take a few moments when life slugged me in the jaw and threw me off balance, I've espoused cheerful. Fiona didn't. She pushed like a battering ram for commitment and took an overdose when he smiled and said no way. She was 29.</p> <p>But most of us survive. You go to bed one night and you're 39 and you wake up incredulous and tremulous, and you're 40. You pat the covers, as if coming round after surgery, and you think, I'm still here. What's more, you haven't fallen apart. Of course, some women do. Some women don't age well. They haven't grown and it's more to do with intelligence than about the way they look.</p> <p>But I love post-40. It's the time when so many women seem to hatch like new-born chicks. (So Goldie Hawn at fiftysomething does look like a fluffy chick.) They break open the shell. They crawl out. They get stronger, brighter, bolder. Men, conversely, get drabber, more predictable, less interesting.</p> <p>The married women I know started reappraising their lives. Took jobs, degrees, retrained. They also started confessing about sex. Especially after the divorces.</p> <p>\"You go through the baby years when you don't sleep, the early school years when you're a chauffeur, the awful teenage years when you're worried sick about your kids' futures. You're busy and tired all the time, you get into bed and you go to sleep. If you're married to a professional man, you know he's rarely home before 8 o'clock,\" says my 52-year-old friend Barbara.</p> <p>\"I was far less confident before I got divorced,\" she adds. \"Post-divorce sex is terrifying to contemplate. Just so frightening. But if you find the right man - and I did - it's magical, simply magical. He made me feel so calm and confident. Told me I had the best body he'd ever seen. I think the pleasure is more intense as you get older.\"</p> <p>But sometimes when the kids have finally flown the nest and there are no more boys bringing home friends and washing on weekends, then couples rediscover each other. I know of two couples having great sex after 32 years, the woman in one case feeling and looking \"better than ever\". There are flowers, romantic restaurants for dinner, weekends away.</p> <p>It's no good asking if sex gets better. It obviously depends who you are and who you're with, and if you liked sex in the first place. And what if you're 45, 50-plus, with a husband who jabs you with his elbow in the small of your back and demands sex just when you're trying to get to doze off?</p> <p>\"Look,\" said another friend, Suzie, \"you either do it in your sleep, which takes a bit of experience, or you say, get off. It's not life-threateningly serious. He's just a man.\" Of course, if he does it too often and there's no foreplay and no postcoital conversation, then you should pack up and leave. But I've known women who don't. Some women can't.</p> <p>Celibate marriages? Britain is bristling with them. But it's rarely talked about. So what is one supposed to make of that? If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. As long as you both don't mind. Of course I have 50-plus friends in celibate marriages who have very good sex lives. With Other People. They wink and grin quite often and do amazing teenage things in the backs of cars parked in dimly lit Notting Hill streets.</p> <p>It all gets so much easier when you disentangle sex from love. When you don't act as if the man owes you something. You attach yourself from a position of detachment. You have a man because you desire him. Not because you need him. God knows that takes years. And years. But so many of my friends have married in their 40s and 50s. It was all easy as Sunday morning stuff. No pain, no strain involved in getting the men to commit. No shyness now.</p> <p>\"So you have a bit of flab and he doesn't always get an erection. So what? You just laugh about it.

      "bodyText": "Does sex get better as you get older? It's such a funny question. I didn't ask women such questions when I was young. Didn't need to. It was obvious to me that after your 40th birthday, you couldn't possibly swing down the street whistling The Best is Yet to Come. Presuming you could whistle. Pre-40, I was too busy with low moaning, heavy breathing and even heavier conversation. Love, sex and romance were inextricably intertwined and it was all a very serious business. You had to get your show on the road. However sharp my memories, filed away with much emotion, I don't think I properly inhabited the present or abandoned myself to love affairs. My report card would have said: \"Could have tried harder.\" But I was too insecure. Well, maybe occasionally I did let go and lighten up. But it was rare. You lived for the future when it would all work out. Or maybe, I thought, you would reach a kind of plateau where you could heave yourself up and relax. Good sex? Sometimes achingly good. Outrageously exciting. I have few grumbles about men and sex. Once or twice it so touched my soul that tears trickled down my cheeks because I knew this couldn't last. However good, it seemed to be tinged with sadness. OK, so I read a lot of Ana\u00efs Nin in those days, I admit it. Her line about women feeling a little lonelier after sex seemed to strike a chord. I was looking, we were all looking, for the Real Thing. I fell in love, or what felt like love at the time, and it was - lovely. By 24, I was beginning to feel attractive. My body was good, I tanned easily, I went in at the waist, had skinny legs, long hair and large breasts. Trouble was, half of London looked like that only better. So though I passed muster, I was not brimming with confidence. Friends were getting married, having kids, and that was a veil past which I couldn't see. Who the hell knew about their sex lives? I didn't have much faith in the excitement of the marital bed and there were no reports from the front. You learn about married sex much later. Women I knew had married for a number of reasons: because they were even more insecure than me, getting panicky, had stumbled on what their mothers thought of as \"a good catch\", or simply figured time was running out. A few were tenderly, enviably in love. Very few. Lots did want children \"one day\". Some young and pretty ones were plucked by older, dominating men. I couldn't even grasp the fact that men asked you out or found you remotely desirable after 40. The assumption was that life was pretty desperate for a woman as you aged. Nova magazine did a cover story on Brigitte Bardot entitled: \"How it feels to be a sex symbol at 35.\" Life was tough at 35. Not as free, easy, fun-loving and wantonly carnal as in her St Tropez youth. It's a wonder you survive the love/sex/romance pressure of youth, and sometimes you don't. Fiona, a trust-fund friend with a colossal sense of humour and awful taste in men, used to advise me how to run my love life. She was the only person I knew seeing a shrink. We'd tried everything to make our latest relationships work when she said one day that she had found a new, foolproof tactic. \"You become incredibly cheerful,\" she said. \"And you stop asking men questions.\" Well, it's true, we had tried everything else. Give or take a few moments when life slugged me in the jaw and threw me off balance, I've espoused cheerful. Fiona didn't. She pushed like a battering ram for commitment and took an overdose when he smiled and said no way. She was 29. But most of us survive. You go to bed one night and you're 39 and you wake up incredulous and tremulous, and you're 40. You pat the covers, as if coming round after surgery, and you think, I'm still here. What's more, you haven't fallen apart. Of course, some women do. Some women don't age well. They haven't grown and it's more to do with intelligence than about the way they look. But I love post-40. It's the time when so many women seem to hatch like new-born chicks. (So Goldie Hawn at fiftysomething does look like a fluffy chick.) They break open the shell. They crawl out. They get stronger, brighter, bolder. Men, conversely, get drabber, more predictable, less interesting. The married women I know started reappraising their lives. Took jobs, degrees, retrained. They also started confessing about sex. Especially after the divorces. \"You go through the baby years when you don't sleep, the early school years when you're a chauffeur, the awful teenage years when you're worried sick about your kids' futures. You're busy and tired all the time, you get into bed and you go to sleep. If you're married to a professional man, you know he's rarely home before 8 o'clock,\" says my 52-year-old friend Barbara. \"I was far less confident before I got divorced,\" she adds. \"Post-divorce sex is terrifying to contemplate. Just so frightening. But if you find the right man - and I did - it's magical, simply magical. He made me feel so calm and confident. Told me I had the best body he'd ever seen. I think the pleasure is more intense as you get older.\" But sometimes when the kids have finally flown the nest and there are no more boys bringing home friends and washing on weekends, then couples rediscover each other. I know of two couples having great sex after 32 years, the woman in one case feeling and looking \"better than ever\". There are flowers, romantic restaurants for dinner, weekends away. It's no good asking if sex gets better. It obviously depends who you are and who you're with, and if you liked sex in the first place. And what if you're 45, 50-plus, with a husband who jabs you with his elbow in the small of your back and demands sex just when you're trying to get to doze off? \"Look,\" said another friend, Suzie, \"you either do it in your sleep, which takes a bit of experience, or you say, get off. It's not life-threateningly serious. He's just a man.\" Of course, if he does it too often and there's no foreplay and no postcoital conversation, then you should pack up and leave. But I've known women who don't. Some women can't. Celibate marriages? Britain is bristling with them. But it's rarely talked about. So what is one supposed to make of that? If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. As long as you both don't mind. Of course I have 50-plus friends in celibate marriages who have very good sex lives. With Other People. They wink and grin quite often and do amazing teenage things in the backs of cars parked in dimly lit Notting Hill streets. It all gets so much easier when you disentangle sex from love. When you don't act as if the man owes you something. You attach yourself from a position of detachment. You have a man because you desire him. Not because you need him. God knows that takes years. And years. But so many of my friends have married in their 40s and 50s. It was all easy as Sunday morning stuff. No pain, no strain involved in getting the men to commit. No shyness now. \"So you have a bit of flab and he doesn't always get an erection. So what? You just laugh about it. I just love my sex life these days,\" says my friend Joanne, who's 54. What can I confess, as one who has stayed single and talks detachment? I look across the gardens now as the sunlight streams into my perfect living room and I think the last thing I need is a man \"to take me away from all this\". That would be dreadful. It's taken me blood, sweat and tears to get here, and I'm happy. Listen, for a woman, life and sex as you get older is a bit like the Grand National. If you didn't fall at the first few hurdles and you're still hanging on in there and giving good race when you're two-thirds of the way round - well, I tell you, it's just great. It's the ride of a life, even though it goes by so fast. More people than you dreamed of seem to be rooting for you. Whatever happens at this point, you feel like a winner. Who'd have thought it?

      "bodyText": "Birth defects in the babies of women who take medicine for epilepsy while they are pregnant are caused by the drugs and not by the epilepsy, according to new research reported in the US. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine today, claims that the idea that the genetic abnormalities which cause the epilepsy are then passed on to the foetus, is wrong. Lewis B Holmes and his colleagues from the paediatric service of Massachusetts general hospital, in Boston, say it is the medication which is to blame for the children's defects. Since the 1970s it has been recognised that women taking the drugs most frequently given to prevent epileptic fits, have a higher risk than usual of giving birth to babies with certain malformations, such as abnormalities of the face and fingers, and retarded growth. The Massachusetts team examined 316 babies born to women who had taken anticonvulsant drugs during pregnancy and 98 babies of women with a history of epilepsy who had not had the medication. They compared the babies with 508 other babies whose mothers did not have epilepsy and had not taken medication while pregnant. They found that the babies of women who had taken drugs for epilepsy had a much higher rate of birth defects - 20.6% of infants exposed to one drug, and 28% of infants exposed to two or more drugs in the womb. This figure compared with 8.5% of those having birth defects and mothers who had taken nothing. Women with epilepsy who had not taken drugs in pregnancy were no more likely to have a baby with birth defects than women who had no history of the disease. The research poses a big dilemma for women with epilepsy, as stopping the medication would put some women and their unborn babies at risk of damage from seizures. A spokeswoman for the British Epilepsy Association said it might not always occur to GPs to raise the issue with their female patients. \"But it is really important for all women with epilepsy who are planning a family to go and seek specialist advice beforehand so that the medication can be looked at and then possibly changed,\" she said.",

The cause of the New Zealand born actor's death on Tuesday was not immeditaely known, and a spokesman for her agent said it had come as a great shock to colleagues, friends and family. She was awarded an OBE in 1971 and starred in programmes such as Madame Bovary and the 1980 drama For Maddie With Love. But she is best remembered playing Irene in the 1967 television phenomenon The Forsyte Saga, which followed the lives of a well-connected Victorian family, and had a worldwide audience of 160m. Porter, who turned down the lead role in the hit TV series The Avengers, married actor Bryon O'Leary, who died of a drugs overdose in 1970. Three years later she married actor Robin Halstead. They divorced in 1987. She leaves a daughter, Talya. Yesterday Alan Yentob, BBC director of drama, entertainment and children's television, said: \"Nyree Dawn Porter was one of the earliest stars of television drama. Her performances, most famously in the Forsyte Saga and Madame Bovary, gripped a generation of viewers.\"",

But Theresa May, the shadow education secretary, said last night: \"There is scope for Ofsted to change the way it inspects schools, but for the sake of maintaining standards we need Ofsted to remain rigorous and independent.\" Mr Blair will today urge delegates to join \"a partnership founded on trust and honesty on both sides\", as he hails teachers' \"skill, dedication and sheer hard work\". \"I am here because teaching is the most critical profession in Britain today,\" he will tell the delegates in Torquay. \"You stand for the values which bind Britain together: equal worth, community, responsibility and the right of everyone to get on and develop their talents to the full.\" He will insist education remains his priority, and pledge to increase again the share of national income spent on education in the next parliament. On Monday, the ATL, the most moderate of the main associations, voted to join three other teacher unions in pursuit of a 35-hour working week. Mr Smith, threatened \"civil disobedience\" in the classroom if their demands were not met. He will present new figures showing that 10,000 more teachers have been employed since 1997, with half of them coming in the last year. Labour has boosted spending per pupil by \u00a3190 in the last year and \u00a3540 since 1997, he will claim. He is expected to pledge to speed up the rise in the number of specialist schools from 600 to 1,500 by 2006.",

And nobody should underestimate the contribution of the Phoenix consortium that took over the company, of the unions, of parts of the media or of the thousands of people who organised and took part in the public campaign. It was the combination of different people's efforts that made the difference as elsewhere. Creating a more pluralistic political culture would help recognise that. Changing the voting system would be a step along that road. Richard Burden MP burdenr@parliament.uk \u0095 Our members of parliament are \"a mystery to us\". But can't this public ignorance be traced back to the MPs and the British system itself? Is it not incredible in the age of the internet that the basic function of MPs - to represent their constituents by voting in parliament - is almost nowhere recorded in a format which would be helpful to the public? At fifthmoon.com we are committed to addressing the democratic deficit where constituents are unable to discover how their MP has voted on the issues which matter to them. \"You and Your MP\" was set up to allow members to check how all 659 MPs voted on issues of particular concern to the over-50s. We applaud the Guardian's Ask Aristotle database and look forward to parliament trusting the people with the information they require to judge the usefulness, or otherwise, of their representatives.

      "body": "<p>If Spike Milligan was the most anarchic member of that cult 1950s BBC Radio show The Goons, Peter Sellers ultimately the richest and Michael Bentine the most sophisticated, Harry Secombe, who has died of prostate cancer aged 79, was the sanest and, in his own way, the most versatile.</p> <p>Apart from being a member of the most wildly manic comedy team since the Crazy Gang, he was a high-powered medium tenor equally at home in opera or musical comedy and, late in life, a knight and a much-loved presenter of religious television programmes for both ITV and the BBC .</p> <p>Whereas the other Goons tended to extremes of temperament and behaviour, the short and tubby Harry Secombe specialised in nothing more dangerous and subversive than endearingly gormless voices and scatological gags like blowing raspberries, at which he professed himself an expert, the only difficulty being their appropriate volume and duration during Royal Variety Performances in the presence of the Queen.</p> <p>His association with Prince Charles, who was charmed by the Goons into frequent imitation, remained equable throughout his life. His marriage to a girl he met long before his fame was similarly stable. Both had had happy, loving childhoods: with that, he always claimed, you could cope with anything.</p> <p>There was hard sense amidst his professional nonsense: he was one of the few performers who declined to be represented by the agent Lew Grade, figuring that Lew's cigar-waving promises of early appearances at the Palladium would be bad for his career and that a slower climb would last longer. He remained on excellent terms with Lord Lew, as with everyone else.</p> <p>Harry Secombe was the third child of a none too successful commercial traveller living on a council estate near Swansea, whose hobby was drawing cartoons. Harry became a church choirboy at seven, was a cat in a Sunday school concert soon after, but blotted his copybook by reading the lesson in church in the North Country tones of the popular comic Sandy Powell. He was so shy that his mouth went dry before every performance, until he realised that if he took off his glasses he couldn't see the audience - or fear them.</p> <p>Both his affinities with church and his benevolence were established early: until he went to school his best friend was a boy with a cleft palate, for whom he acted as \"interpreter\". Guilelessly, he left his autograph book at the Swansea Empire, only to find that the bandleader Roy Fox used a rubber stamp. Unselfishly, he played straight man to his sister Carol in a sketch called The Welsh Courtship at the Central Hall, Swansea; and when at 16 he became a junior pay clerk for a steel firm at 10 shillings (50p) a week, he obligingly took off his superiors for the benefit of his fellow juniors.</p> <p>With war looming in 1939, he joined the Territorial Army and \"went off to war\" with a flourish, standing on the front seat of a friend's open car and imitating Hitler with a comb as the moustache. The recruiting office couldn't deal with him at once, so he went back home later that day. With the Royal Artillery in North Africa and Italy, he gravitated to concert parties and broadcast from Bali in Services Cocktail, a talent show run by Carroll Levis, who specialised in discovering unknown talent.</p> <p>Still not demobbed, the young comic and singer toured US airforce bases in Italy, played the Fairy Queen in a panto and devised a comic routine in which, trying to shave, he immersed the whole area in lather - a sketch he was to use for years after the war. As a member of the Central Pool of Artists touring Italy he met another member, Spike Milligan, whose offbeat sketches were considered rather too advanced, but with whom he felt a professional affinity.</p> <p>Back home in 1946, he met Myra Atherton, the woman destined to become his wife: she and their four children - Andrew, Katy, Jennifer and David - survive him. He then took his shaving routine to that unofficial academy for aspiring comics, the nude-show Windmill Theatre, and appeared increasingly on radio shows, including Welsh Rarebit, sometimes using material written by Michael Bentine.</p> <p>Jimmy Grafton, who wrote scripts for the comedian Derek Roy, kept the Grafton Arms near Victoria station, which became the venue for jazz and comedy sessions involving Secombe, Milligan and Bentine. Later Sellers joined the gang for experimental shows intended for the BBC Light Programme but, as too \"way out\", shunted off to the more experimental and intellectual Third Programme.</p> <p>The quartet met socially as well as for these sessions, in a wildly creative splurge incon ceivable with today's market-led programme planners, who would not have given the time of day to what at the start in 1949 was The Junior Crazy Gang and in 1951 became The Goons - complete with the sententious Major Bloodknock, the dithering Ned, Bluebottle, the villain ous Count Moriarty, Eccles, and other fantastical persons who were to grip Britain for decades.</p> <p>Secombe, the most semi-detached member of the gang, usually joined them only for the recordings of the broadcasts, motoring down in a battered car from his singing and comedy engagements at music halls throughout the country. He and his wife usually stayed only in digs selected from the Actors' Church Union recommended list.</p> <p>Secombe's film career never really took off. His Song of Norway (1970), with Edward G Robinson, fell flat. Davy (1957), for Sir Michael Balcon at the British end of MGM, was the story of a young comic given the chance of a singing career at Covent Garden but turning it down to keep his comedy team together. It caused the Daily Mirror critic Donald Zec to write: \"He sings like Caruso - Sugar Ray Robinson Caruso.\"</p> <p>It was an unjustly flip jibe: Manlio di Veroli, his early singing teacher, said that with \"a little concentration\" he could be the finest medium tenor not only in England, but in the world. Gigli's impresario pressed him often but unsuccessfully to appear with a symphony orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall. \"Concentration\" was difficult when he could make 10 times more money singing and acting in popular shows.</p> <p>His Mr Bumble in the film of Lionel Bart's Oliver! (1968) was acclaimed. But it was Leslie Bricusse's Pickwick (1963) that made him. His song, If I Ruled the World, was an instant recording success, and the stage show itself had a triumph in Britain and on Broadway. In 1993, he revived it at Chichester, rejoicing that he no longer needed a bald wig: it became an annual event.</p> <p>Harry Secombe appeared extensively in popular musicals, including The Four Musketeers (1967), which lost \u00a350,000 during a 14-month run widely thought to have been sustained only by his reputation. He was especially popular in Australia, where during one tour he fell ill and was told he had only two years to live unless he stopped drinking and took his diabetes seriously. He managed to take off five of his 20 stone as well, and became president of the British Diabetic Association.</p> <p>His health never prevented him from singing with several \"serious\" singers, including the duet from Bizet's The Pearl Fishers with Sir Geraint Evans. He also wrote two successful comic novels, Twice Brightly (1974) and Welsh Fargo (1981), as well as two volumes of autobiography and a number of fantastical stories for children.</p> <p>In 1983, Bill Ward of Associated TV suggested a new \"Godslot\" programme with music and interviews from a different place each week. The idea was to talk to survivors of life's hardships, from concentration camp victims to cancer sufferers - anyone who had an uplifting story to tell. It proved a winning formula. The first contract was for six programmes. Highway - the first was from Durham Cathedral with Wendy Craig - ran for 10 years, covering 25,000 miles a year and attracting an audience of seven million. It became, Secombe remembered, a new way of life for him.</p> <p>When it was killed - because it didn't fit the sort of people the commercials were aimed at - he did Sunday With Secombe for Scottish TV, then in the 1990s started presenting Songs of Praise for the BBC. He was undoubtedly one of the few people who could have translated an attractive twinkle into religious programming without detracting either from himself or the programme. He said in his own cod obituary: \"He suffered fools gladly because he was one of them.\" In truth, he only played the fool, steering well clear of most of the disasters to which showbiz personalities can be prone.</p> <p>Captain of the Lord's Taverners Golfing Society for over 25 years, he once introduced Mrs Margaret Thatcher, one of the first woman guests, as \"the thin edge of a delectable wedge\". Mrs Thatcher, apparently thinking it was a reference to her figure, huffily replied that she had never thought of herself as a wedge. It was perhaps fortunate that she had already given him his knighthood.</p> <p>\u0095 Sir Harry Secombe, comic, singer and writer, born September 8 1921; died April 12 2001</p>",

Davy (1957), for Sir Michael Balcon at the British end of MGM, was the story of a young comic given the chance of a singing career at Covent Garden but turning it down to keep his comedy team together. It caused the Daily Mirror critic Donald Zec to write: \"He sings like Caruso - Sugar Ray Robinson Caruso.\" It was an unjustly flip jibe: Manlio di Veroli, his early singing teacher, said that with \"a little concentration\" he could be the finest medium tenor not only in England, but in the world. Gigli's impresario pressed him often but unsuccessfully to appear with a symphony orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall. \"Concentration\" was difficult when he could make 10 times more money singing and acting in popular shows. His Mr Bumble in the film of Lionel Bart's Oliver! (1968) was acclaimed. But it was Leslie Bricusse's Pickwick (1963) that made him. His song, If I Ruled the World, was an instant recording success, and the stage show itself had a triumph in Britain and on Broadway. In 1993, he revived it at Chichester, rejoicing that he no longer needed a bald wig: it became an annual event. Harry Secombe appeared extensively in popular musicals, including The Four Musketeers (1967), which lost \u00a350,000 during a 14-month run widely thought to have been sustained only by his reputation. He was especially popular in Australia, where during one tour he fell ill and was told he had only two years to live unless he stopped drinking and took his diabetes seriously. He managed to take off five of his 20 stone as well, and became president of the British Diabetic Association. His health never prevented him from singing with several \"serious\" singers, including the duet from Bizet's The Pearl Fishers with Sir Geraint Evans. He also wrote two successful comic novels, Twice Brightly (1974) and Welsh Fargo (1981), as well as two volumes of autobiography and a number of fantastical stories for children. In 1983, Bill Ward of Associated TV suggested a new \"Godslot\" programme with music and interviews from a different place each week. The idea was to talk to survivors of life's hardships, from concentration camp victims to cancer sufferers - anyone who had an uplifting story to tell. It proved a winning formula. The first contract was for six programmes. Highway - the first was from Durham Cathedral with Wendy Craig - ran for 10 years, covering 25,000 miles a year and attracting an audience of seven million. It became, Secombe remembered, a new way of life for him. When it was killed - because it didn't fit the sort of people the commercials were aimed at - he did Sunday With Secombe for Scottish TV, then in the 1990s started presenting Songs of Praise for the BBC. He was undoubtedly one of the few people who could have translated an attractive twinkle into religious programming without detracting either from himself or the programme. He said in his own cod obituary: \"He suffered fools gladly because he was one of them.\" In truth, he only played the fool, steering well clear of most of the disasters to which showbiz personalities can be prone. Captain of the Lord's Taverners Golfing Society for over 25 years, he once introduced Mrs Margaret Thatcher, one of the first woman guests, as \"the thin edge of a delectable wedge\". Mrs Thatcher, apparently thinking it was a reference to her figure, huffily replied that she had never thought of herself as a wedge. It was perhaps fortunate that she had already given him his knighthood. \u0095 Sir Harry Secombe, comic, singer and writer, born September 8 1921; died April 12 2001",

But every one of 95 symptoms covered by questionnaires, from tiredness to convulsions, was more frequently mentioned by those who had served in the Gulf. The researchers from Manchester University said more investigation was needed into whether vaccinations or pesticides played a part. But they also concluded that death rates among veterans are no different than other service personnel, and the Ministry of Defence last night insisted: \"There is no evidence of a Gulf war syndrome\". It said the latest work reinforced other findings that although the veterans reported more illness, \"the overall severity of the symptoms is not high\". Lewis Moonie, a junior defence minister, welcomed the findings and said further research was already under way. \"We are determined to continue to address the concerns of Gulf veterans.\" The Manchester study, reported in the medical journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, compared the responses of more than 8,000 UK veterans to those of around 4,000 servicemen and women who had not served in the war. Detailed comparison of exposure to possible risk among the personnel also indicated that severity of symptoms was linked to numbers of inoculations and time spent handling pesticides. The research team concluded: \"There is clear evidence ... that among those who went to the Gulf there are substantial subgroups who feel unwell.

In his 17 years as a Barcelona player Guardiola won the European Cup, the European Cup-Winners' Cup, two European Super Cups and six league titles as well as 43 caps. </p> <p>\"On June 30 I will leave the club to play abroad,\" said the 30-year-old, who has not been offered a new contract by Barcelona. \"It's not an easy decision but after weighing things up I think it's for the best. I met with club president Joan Gaspart last night to inform him of my decision. </p> <p>\"I came to Barcelona without five pesetas and I leave a family man. I had to think of two things: to continue here or to experience new societies, cultures, team-mates, rivals and putting everything into perspective I realised I want to experience new things. </p> <p>\"I don't know where I'll end up as I haven't listened to any offers. I'll be looking at England, France, Germany and Italy. I want to leave to teach all I have learned here, but I'd like to play in another big club and continue to win titles.\" </p> <p>Robson, who has sold almost \u00a322m of talent since the end of last season, expects to meet his chairman Freddie Shepherd later this week to discuss what funds will be available to rebuild in the close season, is convinced he can lure Guardiola to the north-east. </p> <p>\"There isn't anybody that we would be afraid to go and buy,\" he said. \"If we could afford Guardiola's wages, I know he would be prepared to come to Newcastle.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Sunderland's manager Peter Reid is closing in on QPR's Peter Crouch as the replacement for Niall Quinn after sending his coach Adrian Heath and scout Tony Book to watch the 6ft 6in striker at Crewe on Tuesday. </p> <p>QPR are desperate to keep the former England youth international but are in financial crisis and would be unable to resist a \u00a33m offer for the 20-year-old player at the end of the season. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

In his 17 years as a Barcelona player Guardiola won the European Cup, the European Cup-Winners' Cup, two European Super Cups and six league titles as well as 43 caps. \"On June 30 I will leave the club to play abroad,\" said the 30-year-old, who has not been offered a new contract by Barcelona. \"It's not an easy decision but after weighing things up I think it's for the best. I met with club president Joan Gaspart last night to inform him of my decision. \"I came to Barcelona without five pesetas and I leave a family man. I had to think of two things: to continue here or to experience new societies, cultures, team-mates, rivals and putting everything into perspective I realised I want to experience new things. \"I don't know where I'll end up as I haven't listened to any offers. I'll be looking at England, France, Germany and Italy. I want to leave to teach all I have learned here, but I'd like to play in another big club and continue to win titles.\" Robson, who has sold almost \u00a322m of talent since the end of last season, expects to meet his chairman Freddie Shepherd later this week to discuss what funds will be available to rebuild in the close season, is convinced he can lure Guardiola to the north-east. \"There isn't anybody that we would be afraid to go and buy,\" he said. \"If we could afford Guardiola's wages, I know he would be prepared to come to Newcastle.\" Meanwhile, Sunderland's manager Peter Reid is closing in on QPR's Peter Crouch as the replacement for Niall Quinn after sending his coach Adrian Heath and scout Tony Book to watch the 6ft 6in striker at Crewe on Tuesday. QPR are desperate to keep the former England youth international but are in financial crisis and would be unable to resist a \u00a33m offer for the 20-year-old player at the end of the season. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
