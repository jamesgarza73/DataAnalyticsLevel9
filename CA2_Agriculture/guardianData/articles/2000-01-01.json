      "body": "<b>Dear Oliver,</b> <br> The making of resolutions appeals to a primeval part of the human psyche: our need for rituals and symbolism. The act of acknowledging that your health, your finances, or your relationships could be improved by changing something plants a strong message in your subconscious. You identify your needs, whether it's to shed a few pounds or ditch self-limiting behaviour; you garner your thoughts, prioritise, and set goals: all catalysts for change. <p>The ritual of writing things down is a simple yet powerful way of regaining a sense of control after the unchecked excesses of the season. Forward planning is an affirmation of optimism for the future. Just because you behaved in a certain way last year - smoked too much, drank too much, were grumpy in the mornings - does not mean you have to be the same this year. A successful company does not go forward without a good business development strategy. Resolutions are our personal development strategy, a commitment to ourselves. </p> <p>Today is a date unlike any other - a symbolic marker of new beginnings, a fresh start. It's an opportunity for pause in our lives, when we focus on what we want from the year ahead. It occurs at a time when we're overfed and overspent, so we naturally incline towards shaping up, becoming leaner, fitter, focused, solvent. So what's stopping you? Make this the year you realise your dreams!</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Elaine Griffiths </p> <p> <b>Dear Elaine, </b><br> Of course we have to monitor our behaviour and make plans to change it, and of course the start of a new year is a good time to create a punctuation mark - even a new chapter heading - for the next stage in our personal story.</p> <p>But that is not all you are saying. You are offering fool's gold in suggesting that we can realise our dreams. While you may become personally wealthier, through the success of your magazine, if enough people buy into your damaging illusions, the reality is far harsher than that.</p> <p>All of us are powerless to protect ourselves from dog-eat-dog globalised corporatism. It is also extremely hard for us as individuals to grasp the huge impact of our childhood experiences on our adult personalities, something it can take decades, rather than a single year, to sort out. On top of that - although I am sceptical that their effect is great on most people's personality or wellbeing - genes do have a big effect on some people. What if you are a woman who, having consumed the advertising images which pay your wages, dreams of being a 5ft 8in model with fabulous legs but is actually 5ft 2in, with a thick and dumpy lower half?</p> <p>Like so much modern psychology and nearly all think-positive, anyone-can-be-president American psychobilge, you are in the business of encouraging us to believe there are quick fixes for problems that take many years to create and at least as many to solve.</p> <p>Yours sceptically,<br> Oliver James</p> <p><b>Dear Oliver, </b><br> Points taken. But what else should we do? Give up trying? None of us is immune to the arbitrary daily threats to our happiness and wellbeing - whether it's falling victim to aggressive globalised corporatism, the legacy of a less-than-perfect childhood, or a genetic tendency to a thick and dumpy lower half. Most of us accept that there are things we cannot change, but understand that there are things we can: negative habits, attitudes, ways of thinking.</p> <p>Some of us may need help with this - often an expensive process that, presumably, pays your wages. Our early experiences undoubtedly shape our characters, but the notion that we spend the first part our lives accruing damage which we then have to spend decades of the second unravelling denies the capacity of the individual to take some responsibility for the way things are in the here and now.</p> <p>Sure, there are no quick fixes, but there is a lot to be said for not blaming others (our past, our parents, the media) for the way we are now. Accepting that our parents and others did the best they could with the knowledge they had available at the time, forgiving them their human faults and frailties, and trying to understand their own stories is enormously liberating.</p> <p>Far from being psychobilge, it seems to me common sense to accept that we cannot change the past, but also to recognise that we can influence our future through our thoughts, actions, decisions and choices, and that we have within us the capacity to take responsibility for writing our personal story. Resolutions can be a tool for doing this.</p> <p>Whatever way you look at it, Oliver, if we ourselves don't realise our dreams, no one else is going to do it for us.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Elaine</p> <p><b>Dear Elaine, </b><br> I'm not advocating blaming others, nor do I mean to suggest that there is nothing that can be done to help ourselves.

The danger of being relentlessly and exaggeratedly over-optimistic about what can be achieved is that it actually has the opposite effect.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Oliver</p> <p><b>Dear Oliver, </b><br> What a dreary, lacklustre life it would be if we didn't dare to dream. How would anything ever get done if we didn't dare to try because of fear of failure?

The act of acknowledging that your health, your finances, or your relationships could be improved by changing something plants a strong message in your subconscious. You identify your needs, whether it's to shed a few pounds or ditch self-limiting behaviour; you garner your thoughts, prioritise, and set goals: all catalysts for change.

Forward planning is an affirmation of optimism for the future.

Make this the year you realise your dreams! Yours sincerely, Elaine Griffiths Dear Elaine, Of course we have to monitor our behaviour and make plans to change it, and of course the start of a new year is a good time to create a punctuation mark - even a new chapter heading - for the next stage in our personal story. But that is not all you are saying. You are offering fool's gold in suggesting that we can realise our dreams.

Yours sceptically, Oliver James Dear Oliver, Points taken. But what else should we do? Give up trying? None of us is immune to the arbitrary daily threats to our happiness and wellbeing - whether it's falling victim to aggressive globalised corporatism, the legacy of a less-than-perfect childhood, or a genetic tendency to a thick and dumpy lower half. Most of us accept that there are things we cannot change, but understand that there are things we can: negative habits, attitudes, ways of thinking. Some of us may need help with this - often an expensive process that, presumably, pays your wages. Our early experiences undoubtedly shape our characters, but the notion that we spend the first part our lives accruing damage which we then have to spend decades of the second unravelling denies the capacity of the individual to take some responsibility for the way things are in the here and now. Sure, there are no quick fixes, but there is a lot to be said for not blaming others (our past, our parents, the media) for the way we are now. Accepting that our parents and others did the best they could with the knowledge they had available at the time, forgiving them their human faults and frailties, and trying to understand their own stories is enormously liberating. Far from being psychobilge, it seems to me common sense to accept that we cannot change the past, but also to recognise that we can influence our future through our thoughts, actions, decisions and choices, and that we have within us the capacity to take responsibility for writing our personal story. Resolutions can be a tool for doing this. Whatever way you look at it, Oliver, if we ourselves don't realise our dreams, no one else is going to do it for us. Yours, Elaine Dear Elaine, I'm not advocating blaming others, nor do I mean to suggest that there is nothing that can be done to help ourselves. But as Roy Baumeister's research has recently shown, the trouble with insecure people telling themselves (or being told by parents or counsellors) that they are great and that they can achieve whatever they dream of achieving is that it can actually make them even more insecure. Unjustified self-esteem needs constant propping up, and when the real world intervenes in the form of a rejection it can cause depression or even violence: Baumeister's study showed that hostility and aggression were sometimes triggered when falsely inflated self-esteem was popped by reality. On the one hand, an American-style culture of complaint - blaming the parents, government etcetera - will get us nowhere; but on the other, it will not do for parents and governments to deny their ultimate responsibility for how we turn out. As individuals, each of us must eke out as much volition as we can from our lives, but the huge difficuties must not be minimised. The danger of being relentlessly and exaggeratedly over-optimistic about what can be achieved is that it actually has the opposite effect. Yours, Oliver Dear Oliver, What a dreary, lacklustre life it would be if we didn't dare to dream. How would anything ever get done if we didn't dare to try because of fear of failure? Setting ourselves goals and targets in the workplace is seen as perfectly acceptable, as is coaching, encouraging and inspiring others to succeed. Why should things be any different when it comes to making personal resolutions? Furthermore, you must be aware of the plethora of research findings showing the power our thoughts and emotions - positive and negative - have on our physiology and behaviour, most notably in Candace Pert's seminal Molecules of Emotion. Thought-based techniques such as creative visualisation, neuro-linguistic programming, hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy are all gaining scientific credence for their effectiveness in helping to change negative habits. At their most basic, many of these techniques involve the individual thinking about and often writing down their goals, hopes and aspirations - pretty much what most of us do on January 1 each year. Many of them involve shifting the focus on to the positive - reminding yourself of the benefits of losing a few pounds, for example, rather than how many pounds you need to lose - and playing up one's strengths. Should we refrain from positive self-talk for fear of falsely inflating our self-esteem? Of course a balance has to be struck between optimism and realism, but if we don't at least start off with an expectation of success, we'll fall at the first fence. Even if this year's resolution is simply to accept ourselves as we are, warts and all. Now there's a thought... Happy new year, Oliver. Yours, Elaine Dear Elaine, One of the few really interesting findings of cognitive science is that healthy people live in a bubble of positive illusions. At least 121 studies have shown that in general they view themselves in unrealistically positive ways, believing themselves to have far more control over the external events which dominate their lives than is truly the case and being far more optimistic about the future than probability predicts. By contrast, depressed people suffer from what is known as \"depressive realism\".

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Good morning and welcome to the 21st century. You probably feel 1,000 years old today, even those of you who decided to stay in last night, watch the festivities on television and crack open one too many bottles of bubbly. The furthest thing from your mind is likely to be the party capital of northern Europe anyhow. But, rest assured, you'll soon get over any millennial hangover. And remember, the best thing about resolutions is breaking them. </p> <p>Besides, it could be worse. A lot worse. You could have woken up to a credit-card receipt with as many zeroes on it as the year. Which would have been the case had you chosen to see in the new year in Reykjavik. So, console yourself with the fact that you've saved all that money and now you can afford to go out there and indulge yourself. </p> <p>Everything you've read or heard about Reykjavik before is true - it's remote, it's cool, it's expensive and it's wild - only more so. </p> <p>How remote? It's the world's northernmost capital and one of the smallest, with a population a third the size of Bristol's (170,000) stuck out on an island that's almost as big as England, but which, with its volcanic lava fields, geysers and glaciers, is about as uninhabitable as the moon. Outside Reykjavik, it's home to only 107,000 or so more people. </p> <p>How cool? Iceland may share its name with a frozen-food chain, but the climate's not that cold, and the attitude is a lot more upmarket. When Robbie Williams was here last year, he took a stroll down the main shopping street, Laugavegur, accompanied by four burly bodyguards. The locals simply laughed and pretended not to notice him. There's no room for an ego that outsized in a town this small. </p> <p>Besides, most people under the age of 30 seem to play in a pop band and it's hard to be impressed by Robbie Williams when everyone around you looks as if they've just stepped out of the central school of casting for glacial chic. The term \"model society\" applies to features other than Iceland's health service, housing stock and low rate of unemployment. </p> <p>How expensive? A beer will set you back \u00a36 in a bar, a bottle of wine \u00a330 in a restaurant and even the McDonald's takes credit cards. </p> <p>How wild? To quote Blur's Damon Albarn, who owns a flat here, \"They come out at midnight, drink all night, dance like bastards and then run through the streets shagging each other senseless. It's brilliant!\" </p> <p>Reykjavik's hedonistic reputation has preceded it for more than a decade now in articles and features headed \"Diamond geysers\", \"Crazy Norses\" and \"Over the volcanoes\". It's hard, then, not to be initially disappointed when you arrive in a town that, by day, looks distinctly grey, low-rise and deserted. You feel as though the captain must have mis-set the co-ordinates and landed you in Reykjavik, Manitoba, way up in the wastes of northern Canada. What a load of codswallop, you're tempted to think as you take in the fishing fleet on a dockside as grim as Grimsby and contemplate a Friday night dodging the fists of the tanked-up crews. </p> <p>But the seductive charm of Reykjavik is that it reveals its qualities by degrees. Degrees of alcohol, largely, it's true, but still it's impossible not to warm to the place after even a short visit. Architecturally, it may not be the most pre possessing city in the world - an exception is the Pearl restaurant on the hill, its glass-domed dining room revolving on columns supported by silver water tanks. Then there's the modernist City Hall, which juts out into the lake. And all those old red, blue and green townhouses with tin roofs. Oh, and, over the bay, the low-lying, flat-topped Mount Esja. </p> <p>But, generally, it's what's inside the buildings that counts, and you only get to see this when the locals are good and ready to put on a floor show. That usually means after 11pm on a Friday and Saturday night. There's no point starting the weekend any earlier, because the bars stay open till about 5am on these two days and, with alcohol so prohibitively expensive, most people are content to charge themselves up at each other's homes before going out on the \" runtur \". </p> <p>Sounds a bit like rutting, I know, but it's what Icelanders do on a big night out. And it is a bit more sophisticated than it sounds, especially since beer was legalised in 1989, and the locals no longer have to rely on industrial quantities of vodka and the native firewater Brennivin (black death) to act as social lubricants. Basically, the runtur means going from bar to bar and sampling from each until you can no longer be bothered to move on and queue outside another place that promises an even better mix of music and an even more beautiful set of people within. Simply put, it's a pub crawl; except for pubs, read designer bars; and don't expect anybody to crawl when they are wearing Prada, Armani, Diesel and Duffer. </p> <p>The good thing is that most bars are concentrated in a few downtown streets, so you're never more than a stroll away from the next runturing post. </p> <p>A typical Friday night, then, might kick off in the Kaffibarinn, a cosy, little drinking hole that Damon Albarn is reputed to have a stake in. Most locals claim he was given 1%, but that's enough to pack the place with black polo necks by 11.30pm and have you asking for a can-opener to extricate yourself by midnight. </p> <p>Down the road, at the Rex, the tone is less Camden Britpop, more King's Road chrome. It was designed by Sir Terence Conran, after all, and is a minimalist setting fit for the Helmut Lang-labelled to mwah-mwah the Nicole Farhis, for gin and tonics to chink with cocktails called, um, orgasm (peppermint liqueur and Baileys), and for Bj\u00f6rk to be seen wafting down the stairs to the members-only Mafia Room. Even its toilets figure in a best-of-Reykjavik feature in a local boutique's magazine. </p> <p>One o'clock in the morning and all is well: still no sign of chundering Vikings causing carnage in the town. Next stop, Kaffi Thomsen, \"a hip nightclub for the younger generation that boasts a caf\u00e9 atmosphere upstairs [and] a dancefloor in a basement that's styled in a gothic mode\", according to another magazine. In terms of interiors, it doesn't get more basic: wooden floors, window tables and cave-like drawings of horses on the walls. But the DJ by the door is Herb Legowitz of local band Gus Gus, and the music is house, drum'n'bass and a dash of classic disco. People are drinking all right, people are dancing like bastards even, but no one is running down the streets shagging or, indeed, beating each other senseless. Despite the binge-drinking, Iceland has one of the lowest crime rates in the world and vandalism, to people or property, appears minimal. </p> <p>It feels a bit lightweight to be leaving at 4am, but there's another round to come on Saturday night. And besides, there's one more treat in store before the dawn. Down by the docks is a fastfood stand that has a queue of 30 or more people weaving and snaking its way up to the serving hatch. </p> <p>The name picked out in neon is Baejarins Beztu Pylsur, which at this pickled hour could translate as ram's testicles in whey, for all I know and care. Except that a friendly type has already informed me it means City's Best Hotdogs. He also tells me that this particular outlet is so popular the owner can afford to live in Florida off the proceeds (\u00a31 a dog, and people still insist on paying with credit cards). Icelanders love their hotdogs -the secret's in the sauce, apparently, a confection peculiar to the island, called Remoladi, which tops off the usual staples of fried onions, raw onions, steaming dog, ketchup and mustard. Too much information at 4am, but a simpler and cheaper pleasure could not be more appreciated after a night on the runtur . </p> <p>You may find they lie a little heavy on the stomach when you emerge late morning for your next Reykjavik sortie, mind. But a dip in one of the seven naturally-heated outdoor pools within the city limits only goes to confirm why Icelanders look so good despite the ravages of the weekend runtur. That, and the fact that there's very little chlorine in the gene pool. A constitutional swim in warm geothermal spring waters and a relaxing soak in the hot pots is part of the daily routine here. </p> <p>Okay, so tectonic activity coupled with glaciers can have its drawbacks - three years ago the Loki volcano erupted beneath Europe's largest glacier and threatened widespread flooding along the southern coast. But there's no getting away from the fact that, all in all, Icelanders lead pretty clean and healthy lifestyles: hot water pumped straight from the ground to heat their houses and their baths; natural spring water to drink from the taps; and hydroelectric power to keep the computers up to speed with their credit-card spending. All very green. </p> <p>Then there's the diet: fish stocks precious enough to wage and win three cod wars with Britain and free-range lambs to make the Welsh turn green with envy. Apart from that, though, they don't mind what they eat: puffins, rotting shark and cod's chins (whoever knew they had chins?). </p> <p>When it comes to food, Icelanders argue that you get more for your money in terms of quantity and quality in Reykjavik than you do in London. And it's hard to contradict them when you sit down to a meal of hot smoked breast of guillemot with beetroot, cheese and pears, followed by pan-fried plaice with banana and blue cheese sauce (it works, believe me) for \u00a325 in a restaurant as cosy as the Vid Tjornina. Chuck in dessert, wine and coffee, however, and the plastic soon comes in for another pasting. </p> <p>In between all the scoffing and quaffing, let's not forget that Reykjavik is one of the nine European cities of culture this year. Apparently, Iceland publishes more books per capita than any other country in the world and has the highest literacy rate. And they had a Nobel Laureate in novelist Halld\u00f3r Laxness. You could do worse than take in some of the Icelandic sagas displayed on vellum at the Arni Magnusson Institute - more tales of runtur , revenge and rampage to tide you over till the next session. </p> <p>Then there's the bleak but powerful landscapes of artists such as Finnur Jonsson in the National Gallery, which give a pretty good indication of how apocalyptic the landscape must be just beyond the city limits. And finally there's the pi\u00e8ce de resistance , quite literally, in the form of the Icelandic Institute of Phallology. That's right, a penis museum. </p> <p>The director, Sigurdur Hjartarson, started out with a bull's penis that he used as a whip when he was a boy in the country. He has now expanded his collection to include 90 specimens. Since you ask, the smallest belonged to a field mouse and the largest to a blue whale. There's no human trophy on display as yet, though there is a written pledge on the wall beneath a picture of an 84-year-old farmer called Pall Arason. </p> <p>Right. So. Anybody up for a stiff drink? </p> <p><strong>Reykjavik on the cheap</strong> </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Follow the line of incoming locals after Customs and raid the booze shelves in Keflavik airport's duty-free shop. Will save you a small mortgage on the runtur . <br><strong> 2</strong> Lunch lightly on lobster soup at Laekjarbrekka restaurant (Bankastraeti 2), which specialises in Icelandic cuisine. Built in 1834, this is one of the oldest houses in Reykjavik. Prices have gone up a bit since, though, and soup will set you back about \u00a310. <br><strong> 3</strong> Swim at one of the city's seven naturally-heated outdoor pools.

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to the 21st century. You probably feel 1,000 years old today, even those of you who decided to stay in last night, watch the festivities on television and crack open one too many bottles of bubbly. The furthest thing from your mind is likely to be the party capital of northern Europe anyhow. But, rest assured, you'll soon get over any millennial hangover. And remember, the best thing about resolutions is breaking them. Besides, it could be worse. A lot worse. You could have woken up to a credit-card receipt with as many zeroes on it as the year. Which would have been the case had you chosen to see in the new year in Reykjavik. So, console yourself with the fact that you've saved all that money and now you can afford to go out there and indulge yourself. Everything you've read or heard about Reykjavik before is true - it's remote, it's cool, it's expensive and it's wild - only more so. How remote? It's the world's northernmost capital and one of the smallest, with a population a third the size of Bristol's (170,000) stuck out on an island that's almost as big as England, but which, with its volcanic lava fields, geysers and glaciers, is about as uninhabitable as the moon. Outside Reykjavik, it's home to only 107,000 or so more people. How cool? Iceland may share its name with a frozen-food chain, but the climate's not that cold, and the attitude is a lot more upmarket. When Robbie Williams was here last year, he took a stroll down the main shopping street, Laugavegur, accompanied by four burly bodyguards. The locals simply laughed and pretended not to notice him. There's no room for an ego that outsized in a town this small. Besides, most people under the age of 30 seem to play in a pop band and it's hard to be impressed by Robbie Williams when everyone around you looks as if they've just stepped out of the central school of casting for glacial chic. The term \"model society\" applies to features other than Iceland's health service, housing stock and low rate of unemployment. How expensive? A beer will set you back \u00a36 in a bar, a bottle of wine \u00a330 in a restaurant and even the McDonald's takes credit cards. How wild? To quote Blur's Damon Albarn, who owns a flat here, \"They come out at midnight, drink all night, dance like bastards and then run through the streets shagging each other senseless. It's brilliant!\" Reykjavik's hedonistic reputation has preceded it for more than a decade now in articles and features headed \"Diamond geysers\", \"Crazy Norses\" and \"Over the volcanoes\". It's hard, then, not to be initially disappointed when you arrive in a town that, by day, looks distinctly grey, low-rise and deserted. You feel as though the captain must have mis-set the co-ordinates and landed you in Reykjavik, Manitoba, way up in the wastes of northern Canada. What a load of codswallop, you're tempted to think as you take in the fishing fleet on a dockside as grim as Grimsby and contemplate a Friday night dodging the fists of the tanked-up crews. But the seductive charm of Reykjavik is that it reveals its qualities by degrees. Degrees of alcohol, largely, it's true, but still it's impossible not to warm to the place after even a short visit. Architecturally, it may not be the most pre possessing city in the world - an exception is the Pearl restaurant on the hill, its glass-domed dining room revolving on columns supported by silver water tanks. Then there's the modernist City Hall, which juts out into the lake. And all those old red, blue and green townhouses with tin roofs. Oh, and, over the bay, the low-lying, flat-topped Mount Esja. But, generally, it's what's inside the buildings that counts, and you only get to see this when the locals are good and ready to put on a floor show. That usually means after 11pm on a Friday and Saturday night. There's no point starting the weekend any earlier, because the bars stay open till about 5am on these two days and, with alcohol so prohibitively expensive, most people are content to charge themselves up at each other's homes before going out on the \" runtur \". Sounds a bit like rutting, I know, but it's what Icelanders do on a big night out. And it is a bit more sophisticated than it sounds, especially since beer was legalised in 1989, and the locals no longer have to rely on industrial quantities of vodka and the native firewater Brennivin (black death) to act as social lubricants. Basically, the runtur means going from bar to bar and sampling from each until you can no longer be bothered to move on and queue outside another place that promises an even better mix of music and an even more beautiful set of people within. Simply put, it's a pub crawl; except for pubs, read designer bars; and don't expect anybody to crawl when they are wearing Prada, Armani, Diesel and Duffer. The good thing is that most bars are concentrated in a few downtown streets, so you're never more than a stroll away from the next runturing post. A typical Friday night, then, might kick off in the Kaffibarinn, a cosy, little drinking hole that Damon Albarn is reputed to have a stake in. Most locals claim he was given 1%, but that's enough to pack the place with black polo necks by 11.30pm and have you asking for a can-opener to extricate yourself by midnight. Down the road, at the Rex, the tone is less Camden Britpop, more King's Road chrome. It was designed by Sir Terence Conran, after all, and is a minimalist setting fit for the Helmut Lang-labelled to mwah-mwah the Nicole Farhis, for gin and tonics to chink with cocktails called, um, orgasm (peppermint liqueur and Baileys), and for Bj\u00f6rk to be seen wafting down the stairs to the members-only Mafia Room. Even its toilets figure in a best-of-Reykjavik feature in a local boutique's magazine. One o'clock in the morning and all is well: still no sign of chundering Vikings causing carnage in the town. Next stop, Kaffi Thomsen, \"a hip nightclub for the younger generation that boasts a caf\u00e9 atmosphere upstairs [and] a dancefloor in a basement that's styled in a gothic mode\", according to another magazine. In terms of interiors, it doesn't get more basic: wooden floors, window tables and cave-like drawings of horses on the walls. But the DJ by the door is Herb Legowitz of local band Gus Gus, and the music is house, drum'n'bass and a dash of classic disco. People are drinking all right, people are dancing like bastards even, but no one is running down the streets shagging or, indeed, beating each other senseless. Despite the binge-drinking, Iceland has one of the lowest crime rates in the world and vandalism, to people or property, appears minimal. It feels a bit lightweight to be leaving at 4am, but there's another round to come on Saturday night. And besides, there's one more treat in store before the dawn. Down by the docks is a fastfood stand that has a queue of 30 or more people weaving and snaking its way up to the serving hatch. The name picked out in neon is Baejarins Beztu Pylsur, which at this pickled hour could translate as ram's testicles in whey, for all I know and care. Except that a friendly type has already informed me it means City's Best Hotdogs. He also tells me that this particular outlet is so popular the owner can afford to live in Florida off the proceeds (\u00a31 a dog, and people still insist on paying with credit cards). Icelanders love their hotdogs -the secret's in the sauce, apparently, a confection peculiar to the island, called Remoladi, which tops off the usual staples of fried onions, raw onions, steaming dog, ketchup and mustard. Too much information at 4am, but a simpler and cheaper pleasure could not be more appreciated after a night on the runtur . You may find they lie a little heavy on the stomach when you emerge late morning for your next Reykjavik sortie, mind. But a dip in one of the seven naturally-heated outdoor pools within the city limits only goes to confirm why Icelanders look so good despite the ravages of the weekend runtur. That, and the fact that there's very little chlorine in the gene pool. A constitutional swim in warm geothermal spring waters and a relaxing soak in the hot pots is part of the daily routine here. Okay, so tectonic activity coupled with glaciers can have its drawbacks - three years ago the Loki volcano erupted beneath Europe's largest glacier and threatened widespread flooding along the southern coast. But there's no getting away from the fact that, all in all, Icelanders lead pretty clean and healthy lifestyles: hot water pumped straight from the ground to heat their houses and their baths; natural spring water to drink from the taps; and hydroelectric power to keep the computers up to speed with their credit-card spending. All very green. Then there's the diet: fish stocks precious enough to wage and win three cod wars with Britain and free-range lambs to make the Welsh turn green with envy. Apart from that, though, they don't mind what they eat: puffins, rotting shark and cod's chins (whoever knew they had chins?). When it comes to food, Icelanders argue that you get more for your money in terms of quantity and quality in Reykjavik than you do in London. And it's hard to contradict them when you sit down to a meal of hot smoked breast of guillemot with beetroot, cheese and pears, followed by pan-fried plaice with banana and blue cheese sauce (it works, believe me) for \u00a325 in a restaurant as cosy as the Vid Tjornina. Chuck in dessert, wine and coffee, however, and the plastic soon comes in for another pasting. In between all the scoffing and quaffing, let's not forget that Reykjavik is one of the nine European cities of culture this year. Apparently, Iceland publishes more books per capita than any other country in the world and has the highest literacy rate. And they had a Nobel Laureate in novelist Halld\u00f3r Laxness. You could do worse than take in some of the Icelandic sagas displayed on vellum at the Arni Magnusson Institute - more tales of runtur , revenge and rampage to tide you over till the next session. Then there's the bleak but powerful landscapes of artists such as Finnur Jonsson in the National Gallery, which give a pretty good indication of how apocalyptic the landscape must be just beyond the city limits. And finally there's the pi\u00e8ce de resistance , quite literally, in the form of the Icelandic Institute of Phallology. That's right, a penis museum. The director, Sigurdur Hjartarson, started out with a bull's penis that he used as a whip when he was a boy in the country. He has now expanded his collection to include 90 specimens. Since you ask, the smallest belonged to a field mouse and the largest to a blue whale. There's no human trophy on display as yet, though there is a written pledge on the wall beneath a picture of an 84-year-old farmer called Pall Arason. Right. So. Anybody up for a stiff drink? Reykjavik on the cheap 1 Follow the line of incoming locals after Customs and raid the booze shelves in Keflavik airport's duty-free shop. Will save you a small mortgage on the runtur . 2 Lunch lightly on lobster soup at Laekjarbrekka restaurant (Bankastraeti 2), which specialises in Icelandic cuisine. Built in 1834, this is one of the oldest houses in Reykjavik. Prices have gone up a bit since, though, and soup will set you back about \u00a310. 3 Swim at one of the city's seven naturally-heated outdoor pools. At \u00a31.70, they're a cheap hangover cure and a convenient alternative to the Blue Lagoon. Sundlaug vesturbaejar (Hofsvallagata) is the oldest and has the most local characters. 4 Hotdog supper.

Ruth Usher, the organiser of the event and this year also a participant for the first time, said: \"The water was absolutely freezing but it was good fun. We ran in from the beach and stayed in for about five minutes although it felt like ages.\" The babies A baby born in Dublin at one second after midnight is thought to be the first millennium baby in the British Isles. Antoinette McGarr gave birth to her daughter, Caroline Anne, at Dublin's Coombe hospital as the city's church bells had just begun to ring in the new year. Ms McGarr, who said she had turned down advice to call the new baby Millie in honour of the event, today received a cheque for IR\u00a31,000 from the hospital. Britain's first millennium twins were born to Zenna and Gary Doherty, from Angus, northeast Scotland. A girl was born at five minutes past midnight, followed at 29 minutes past midnight by a boy. The weddings Two brides and two grooms battled to become England's first millennium couple this morning. David Hollingdrake, 47, and Alison Bully, 31, tied the knot at 8am, the earliest they were allowed to marry by law, at Liverpool town hall. At the same time at Scarborough register office Gordon Jackson and Adele Vickers were exchanging declarations of love in a ceremony timed meticulously so that the legal exchange of words coincided with the pips on BBC Radio 4. The Prince of Wales Prince Charles delivered the first Thought for the Day of the millennium on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In a message which dwelt on religious and spiritual themes, the prince said: \" The millennium provides us with an opportunity to abandon the poles of blind optimism on the one hand and total despair on the other, and to re-discover a much older emotion - hope.\" Life is a strange paradox, the Prince said, and the art of living consists of achieving balance and harmony. Arguing that human rationality has limits, he concluded: \"Perhaps, in the midst of all the celebrations and the hype, deep down inside many of us may feel intuitively - to paraphrase a wonderful passage from Dante - that the strongest desire of everything, and the one first implanted by nature, is to return to its source. And since God is the source of our souls and has made it alike unto himself... therefore this soul desires above all things to return to Him.\" Read the full text of Prince Charles's Thought for the Day",

I daresay many of us will have decided what it does not mean. Will it - for instance, be an \"experience\" - the dawning of an exciting moment when we step boldly across a threshold marked \"21st Century\" and emerge into the golden, promised land of a perennial future where there shall be no more \"wailing and gnashing of teeth\", where water flows uphill and the whole of humanity is genetically re-engineered? Or will it, perhaps, provide a Sacred moment of reflection as we celebrate the 2000th anniversary of that unique occurrence when \"the word became flesh and dwelt among us\"? Will it remind us that each New Year represents, as did Christ's mysterious birth, a microcosm of the vital process of renewal that dominates our existence? For although our everyday lives seem to be dominated by linear time, one day following the next and year following year in an unbroken line, each New Year reminds us of the importance in our existence of natural cycles, of events which continually recur. But, of course, there is all the difference in the world between renewing what is old and replacing old with new. The Millennium provides us with an opportunity to abandon the poles of blind optimism on the one hand and total despair on the other, and to re-discover a much older emotion - hope. Hope belongs to a world which recognizes the idea of limits; going with the grain of nature and cherishing, and learning, from the best of what we have inherited from the past. In this sense, the dawn of a new millennium should not be the excuse for a bonfire of the past, but a chance to re-discover the profound wisdom of those who have made the difficult journey through this life before us; those who, like Our Lord Jesus Christ, taught that this life is but one passing phase of our existence and that the reality lies within each one of us. Or, as Rilke put it - \"Death is the side of life turned away from us.\" In an era when we are tempted to believe that science knows nearly all the answers it is instructive to recall that Einstein understood the close connection between wonder and the sacred. To him the sense of wonder was the most important sense to open ourselves to the truth, the immensity of the mystery and the Divinity of ourselves and our world. He wrote that \"a person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his abilities, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their supra-personal value.\" As we enter a new Millennium, with all its hopes and fears, I pray that we may come to realise that life is a strange paradox and that the art of living it lies in striking a balance; and that it is a sacred thing to compose harmony out of opposites.

      "bodyText": "The Pope last night vowed to slice through the secular euphoria of the millennium celebrations by mobilising 1bn Catholics into a spiritual task force to lead the world in a year of repentance. The stroke of midnight signalled one of the toughest fights of John Paul II's papacy: to stamp Christianity's ownership on the celebrations. For two decades he has prepared for this moment, striving to infuse significance and wonder into the 2,000 anniversary of Christ's birth. More than 50,000 pilgrims packed St Peter's square at midnight to hear the ailing Pope give his address from the central loggia of the newly scrubbed basilica. More than 20m pilgrims are expected to converge on Rome during the next 12 months for the Vatican's biggest ever holy year, or jubilee. Almost continual commemorations, celebrations and contemplations, with a mass rally every fortnight, are intended to make Rome, the focus of worldwide soul-searching. The 79-year-old Pope has overcome numerous illnesses to defy those who had belittled the year 2000 as being little more than a mathematical curiosity. He has declared this a time for redressing personal wrongs, especially the misdeeds of the Catholic church. He has in recent months reached out to Anglicans, Muslims, Hindus, Jews and Orthodox Christians. Some Vatican insiders say that it is John Paul's belief that God has chosen him to lead the holy year that has kept him going. All obstacles have been batted away, sometimes controversially. Pop concerts at the Piazza del Popolo, the Quirinale palace and St Peter's square entertained Romans, but no one was in doubt that when the champagne ran out and the music ended, then, like it or not, the coming year would belong to the pilgrims. The spending of \u00a31.4bn of taxpayers' money to improve roads, tunnels, bridges and rail links has spawned 700 building sites, traffic chaos, scared away more lucrative tourists and sliced up an ancient imperial villa to make way for a Vatican parking garage. Many Romans like it not. More seriously, his efforts to lure other religions into joining the jamboree have faltered. Visits to India and Georgia in November angered Hindus and left the Orthodox church unmoved. In the western world attendances at mass and vocations continue to slide. Whether these forces will loosen Christianity's grip on the celebrations time will tell, but yesterday the Pope seemed invigorated as he led the century's final Te Deum during Vespers at St Peter's basilica. The church held its first jubilee in 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII urged pilgrims to earn indulgences in Rome because wars had made it difficult to reach the holy land. Because each Pope wanted a chance to preside over a holy year, they have been scheduled every 25 years since 1475. Each one has been assailed by doubters who warned that war, plague, poverty or indifference would deter pilgrims and doom the jubilee. Each time the Vatican gave the same reply: trust in providence. And providence obliged - sometimes.",

In 1970 one of the chain's biggest franchisees, moving millions of burgers in Hollywood, feared for their managers, who worked 15-hour shifts scattered over nights and days for little more than \u00a32 an hour.</p> <p>Some of these 'crew leaders' took on that look of insomniac spookiness that one imagines could end with one of them 'going postal', the colloquialism for what happens when the Californian penchant for self-expression meets the American fascination with automatic weapons. So my mother taught them self-hypnosis. 'Twenty minutes' trance is worth four hours' sleep!' Maybe that's why I don't eat burgers any more. I wonder about those grinning, unblinking faces, asking: 'Do you want fries with that?'</p> <p>Ronald McDonald's first UK outlet opened in Woolwich, South East London, on 2 October 1974 - a quarter-century milestone that passed without commemoration recently. </p> <p>But we shouldn't enter the new millennium without acknowledging that McDonald's significance consists of far more than caterers to the Dome. </p> <p>To residents of Montparnasse and Hampstead, McDonald's heralds the Bozo-headed d\u00e9class\u00e9 Americanisation of Europe. But to me, it represents something far more sinister: the Americanisation of America. This is my last Inside America column for a while, so I have to get this off my chest: America is ugly.</p> <p>A conspiracy of British travel writers has sold the image of America the Beautiful: Georgia O'Keefe sunsets over New Mexico's plateau, the wide-open vistas of the Grand Canyon. But to get there, you must drive through a numbing, repetitive vortex of Pizza Hut, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, The Gap, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Starbucks and McDonald's. All the separate tastes - New Orleans jambalaya, Harlem ham hocks, New England crab boil - the uniqueness of region and town have been hunted and herded into a few tourist preserves. The oppressive ubiquity of contrived American monoculture has ingested and eliminated any threat of character. The words of McDonald's late chief executive Ray Kroc - 'We cannot trust some people who are nonconformists' - have become our national anthem.</p> <p>Almost. One hundred miles dead east of New York City, a hamlet of farmers called Southold held out. Southold was the last place in New York State where you could look from a rolling road across an open cornfield uninterrupted by Golden Arches. The town board refused McDonald's request to build. 'Just not part of our rural character,' it said. A group of visiting English land-use experts had planted the un-American idea of 'stewardship' trumping property rights. In Britain, these battles are common stuff - last month 40 mothers and children in Harrow, north London, marched against conversion of the Hungry Horse pub into yet another Avaricious Clown, but in the States 'Tiny town resists' was national news.</p> <p> Southold's rebellion lasted six years. Then McDonald's threatened law suits, and Southold - my town - bowed down. Today, Southold schools take students on 'educational' outings to McDonald's.</p> <p>This McDonald's story is my contribution to the Big Bubble debate. A whole gaggle of pressroom Chicken Lickens has issued apocalyptic warnings about the huge speculative rise in share prices that must soon burst and spew financial fire, brimstone and bankruptcies.</p> <p>But stay calm. The sky is not falling. The Bubble Theorem is the creation of good-hearted souls of the Left, made ill by the orgy of monstrous increases in wealth for a few and begging bowls for the many. The world's 300 richest men are worth more than the world's poorest 3 billion. They believe the stock market cannot rise indefinitely on the promises of dot.coms that sell nothing, yet lay claim to a large share of the planet's wealth. The Guardian's Larry Elliot sermonises about the 'day of reckoning'.</p> <p>But this belief that a price must be paid is religion, not economics - Calvinism in Marxist clothing. What the Left fails to accept is that the class war, as Messrs Blair and Clinton tell us, is over - not because we have reached a happy social entente, but because the working class has been defeated soundly, convincingly, absolutely.</p> <p>Dr Edward Wolff, director of the Income Studies Project at the Jerome Levy Institute in New York, will soon report that between 1983 and 1997, 85.5 per cent of the vaunted increase in America's wealth was captured by the richest 1 per cent of the population. In that time, the country's income rocketed - yet 80 per cent of American families received 0 per cent of that increase. The market's up, but who is the market? The gilded 1 per cent owns $2.9 trillion of US stocks and bonds out of a total $3.5 billion, says Wolff.</p> <p>By no coincidence at all, the rise in the riches of the rich matches quite well the wealth lost by production workers through their falling share of the productivity captured by wages. US workers produced more per hour (up 17 per cent since 1983) while keeping less of it (down 3.1 per cent). The market is not rising on a bubble of fictions but on the rock-hard foundation of the spoils of the class war.</p> <p>What's going on? Forget Robert Reich's sweet notion that computers can make work more meaningful. The purpose of every industrial revolution, from the steam-powered loom to the assembly line, is to make skills obsolete, and people interchangeable and cheap. And now, computerisation is speeding the industrialisation of service work. </p> <p>That brings us back to McDonald's. While Kroc gets the kudos for building the company, it was the genius of the brothers McDonald - Richard and Maurice - in 1948 to divide the production of restaurant food into discrete, skill-less tasks and methodically, ruthlessly apply to the corner greasy spoon the time and motion paradigm that rules factory assembly lines. No more cooks. Any clown can make a hamburger for McDonald's. Their machines are designed so that unskilled workers can reach full speed on any job in minutes. Your Prime Minister believes computers will spawn a Knowledge Economy. Oh, yeah. At McD's, you can spend all day punching machine-portioned glops of ketchup on to burger buns.</p> <p>The Observer has learnt that McDonald's has retained the notorious union-busting law firm, Jackson Lewis of New York (which is now seeking work in the UK). But why should McDonald's bother? Fast food operators' employee turnover averages 300 per cent a year - and, whatever it says, the industry must love it. Workers out of the door in four months don't demand pensions, promotions, training or unions. </p> <p>In 1996, the McLibel court in London found that the company depressed the pay of young workers in the catering trade in Britain. But that is temporary. It won't be long before workers of all ages in all industries will need no more experience than any 17-year-old slacker - and be paid like one.</p> <p>It is estimated that one in eight American adults has worked at a McDonald's. It acts as a kind of moral instruction for the working class, like jail time in the ghetto. It is one reason behind America's low unemployment rate. As my old professor, Milton Friedman, taught me, unemployment falls when workers give up hope of higher pay.</p> <p>How fitting that the Battle of Seattle began when crazies threw a rubbish bin through the window of a McDonald's. The question is, will it break the trance?</p> <p>\u0095 Email <a href=\"'mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com'\"> gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Some of these 'crew leaders' took on that look of insomniac spookiness that one imagines could end with one of them 'going postal', the colloquialism for what happens when the Californian penchant for self-expression meets the American fascination with automatic weapons. So my mother taught them self-hypnosis. 'Twenty minutes' trance is worth four hours' sleep!' Maybe that's why I don't eat burgers any more. I wonder about those grinning, unblinking faces, asking: 'Do you want fries with that?' Ronald McDonald's first UK outlet opened in Woolwich, South East London, on 2 October 1974 - a quarter-century milestone that passed without commemoration recently. But we shouldn't enter the new millennium without acknowledging that McDonald's significance consists of far more than caterers to the Dome. To residents of Montparnasse and Hampstead, McDonald's heralds the Bozo-headed d\u00e9class\u00e9 Americanisation of Europe. But to me, it represents something far more sinister: the Americanisation of America. This is my last Inside America column for a while, so I have to get this off my chest: America is ugly. A conspiracy of British travel writers has sold the image of America the Beautiful: Georgia O'Keefe sunsets over New Mexico's plateau, the wide-open vistas of the Grand Canyon. But to get there, you must drive through a numbing, repetitive vortex of Pizza Hut, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, The Gap, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Starbucks and McDonald's. All the separate tastes - New Orleans jambalaya, Harlem ham hocks, New England crab boil - the uniqueness of region and town have been hunted and herded into a few tourist preserves. The oppressive ubiquity of contrived American monoculture has ingested and eliminated any threat of character. The words of McDonald's late chief executive Ray Kroc - 'We cannot trust some people who are nonconformists' - have become our national anthem. Almost. One hundred miles dead east of New York City, a hamlet of farmers called Southold held out. Southold was the last place in New York State where you could look from a rolling road across an open cornfield uninterrupted by Golden Arches. The town board refused McDonald's request to build. 'Just not part of our rural character,' it said. A group of visiting English land-use experts had planted the un-American idea of 'stewardship' trumping property rights. In Britain, these battles are common stuff - last month 40 mothers and children in Harrow, north London, marched against conversion of the Hungry Horse pub into yet another Avaricious Clown, but in the States 'Tiny town resists' was national news. Southold's rebellion lasted six years. Then McDonald's threatened law suits, and Southold - my town - bowed down. Today, Southold schools take students on 'educational' outings to McDonald's. This McDonald's story is my contribution to the Big Bubble debate. A whole gaggle of pressroom Chicken Lickens has issued apocalyptic warnings about the huge speculative rise in share prices that must soon burst and spew financial fire, brimstone and bankruptcies. But stay calm. The sky is not falling. The Bubble Theorem is the creation of good-hearted souls of the Left, made ill by the orgy of monstrous increases in wealth for a few and begging bowls for the many. The world's 300 richest men are worth more than the world's poorest 3 billion. They believe the stock market cannot rise indefinitely on the promises of dot.coms that sell nothing, yet lay claim to a large share of the planet's wealth. The Guardian's Larry Elliot sermonises about the 'day of reckoning'. But this belief that a price must be paid is religion, not economics - Calvinism in Marxist clothing. What the Left fails to accept is that the class war, as Messrs Blair and Clinton tell us, is over - not because we have reached a happy social entente, but because the working class has been defeated soundly, convincingly, absolutely. Dr Edward Wolff, director of the Income Studies Project at the Jerome Levy Institute in New York, will soon report that between 1983 and 1997, 85.5 per cent of the vaunted increase in America's wealth was captured by the richest 1 per cent of the population. In that time, the country's income rocketed - yet 80 per cent of American families received 0 per cent of that increase. The market's up, but who is the market? The gilded 1 per cent owns $2.9 trillion of US stocks and bonds out of a total $3.5 billion, says Wolff. By no coincidence at all, the rise in the riches of the rich matches quite well the wealth lost by production workers through their falling share of the productivity captured by wages. US workers produced more per hour (up 17 per cent since 1983) while keeping less of it (down 3.1 per cent). The market is not rising on a bubble of fictions but on the rock-hard foundation of the spoils of the class war. What's going on? Forget Robert Reich's sweet notion that computers can make work more meaningful. The purpose of every industrial revolution, from the steam-powered loom to the assembly line, is to make skills obsolete, and people interchangeable and cheap. And now, computerisation is speeding the industrialisation of service work. That brings us back to McDonald's. While Kroc gets the kudos for building the company, it was the genius of the brothers McDonald - Richard and Maurice - in 1948 to divide the production of restaurant food into discrete, skill-less tasks and methodically, ruthlessly apply to the corner greasy spoon the time and motion paradigm that rules factory assembly lines. No more cooks. Any clown can make a hamburger for McDonald's. Their machines are designed so that unskilled workers can reach full speed on any job in minutes. Your Prime Minister believes computers will spawn a Knowledge Economy. Oh, yeah. At McD's, you can spend all day punching machine-portioned glops of ketchup on to burger buns. The Observer has learnt that McDonald's has retained the notorious union-busting law firm, Jackson Lewis of New York (which is now seeking work in the UK). But why should McDonald's bother? Fast food operators' employee turnover averages 300 per cent a year - and, whatever it says, the industry must love it. Workers out of the door in four months don't demand pensions, promotions, training or unions. In 1996, the McLibel court in London found that the company depressed the pay of young workers in the catering trade in Britain. But that is temporary. It won't be long before workers of all ages in all industries will need no more experience than any 17-year-old slacker - and be paid like one. It is estimated that one in eight American adults has worked at a McDonald's. It acts as a kind of moral instruction for the working class, like jail time in the ghetto. It is one reason behind America's low unemployment rate. As my old professor, Milton Friedman, taught me, unemployment falls when workers give up hope of higher pay. How fitting that the Battle of Seattle began when crazies threw a rubbish bin through the window of a McDonald's. The question is, will it break the trance? \u0095 Email gregory.palast@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Humphrey Jennings could have been the great surrealist of British cinema. He could have also been the great poet of British cinema. He could have even been the great realist of British cinema. In the end, he died with one documentary feature under his belt, and a hatful of shorts that could be dismissed as war-time propaganda. </p> <p>But the one feature he did make, Fires Were Started, remains one of Britain's most influential films. It is the only documentary in the British Film Institute's list of 360 key works, and in many ways can be seen to have paved the way for Ken Loach. </p> <p>Fires Were Started is riddled with contradictions. It is a scripted, acted documentary about a blaze during the Blitz - in other words, it is not a documentary. Yet it is as real as anything British cinema has produced. It features working-class characters going about their lives, doing things traditionally left out of movies - playing pool and darts, snoozing, having a singsong, practising running up ladders. The dialogue overlaps, and can be difficult to make out. The actors are not professionals, they are actually firemen. And although the film is as dramatic as it gets, climaxing with a fatal blaze, much of the drama is found in the tiniest whistles and croaks. </p> <p>Jennings was not really interested in telling a story. He simply wanted to observe. As the critic Dilys Powell said, he was \"happy conveying the feeling of a human being. The way a man walks, shouts to his friends, the way a girl sings at her work\". </p> <p>There is a rare opportunity to see his work throughout January in a retrospective at the National Film Theatre. Despite being limited by the need for feel-good propaganda, Jennings's films are astonishingly diverse. As a young man he was a member of the surrealist movement, and its influence is obvious in one of his great films, a 19-minute short called Listen to Britain. The film consists of a series of apparently unrelated images (here is the pianist Myra Hess playing Beethoven to the Queen, there are the comedians Flanagan and Allen shadowing the stage, this is how a jet engine works, there is the sunrise of your dreams) which somehow build into a compelling portrait of the Britain of its day. His use of montage looked back to Eisenstein and forward to Terence Davies. Jennings hoped to strip film of its literalism, and the result was it affected us more like a painting or jazz. </p> <p>He was born in 1907 into the kind of family that George Orwell pinpointed as \"lower-upper- middle class\". His father was a left- leaning architect, mother was a painter, and both were Guild socialists. Jennings was sent to public school and then on to Cambridge. He was a brilliant academic who was so good at so many things - poet, painter, writer - that he was dismissed as a dilettante. In 1936 he helped to organise the International Surrealist Exhibition in London and contributed a few pieces of his own work. But by this time he had discovered his real love - film - and was working for the GPO's film-making unit under John Grierson. </p> <p>He never regarded himself as political, but like the other early documentary makers he was determined to highlight the role of working-class people in British life. Until then film had been the preserve of the middle and upper classes. Joe Mendoza, assistant director on Listen to Britain, says: \"Humphrey wanted to show that working-class life was vital and interesting, that work was not simply done by machines, it was done by people who laughed and played.\" </p> <p>Jennings didn't fit in easily with the GPO film team, which later turned into the Crown Film Unit. John Grierson regarded him as an overly poetic patroniser of the working classes. He would talk about visiting the cutting room to \"see Humphrey being nice to the common people\". At times, the films were undoubtedly patronising. In A Diary for Timothy, Jennings's state-of-the nation address to a new baby, the working-class characters are crushed by the pomposity of narrator Michael Redgrave and a ham-fisted script from EM Forster. </p> <p>But when he got it right, as in Fires Were Started, Jennings was awesome. There was no voiceover, it was simply as if we were allowed to eavesdrop on a slice of life. He never had any time for conventional heroics. If anything the firemen were heroically unheroic, a Dad's Army of a service - occasionally they'd point the hose in the wrong direction, mistake a sewer cover for a water hydrant, lose their colleagues. What emerged most powerfully was stoicism, a togetherness that transcended class and social differences, however temporarily. </p> <p>Few people could bare to work with Jennings. Joe Mendoza says: \"He used to get through two assistant directors a film. I was 19 when they asked me to work with him and I wept. I said 'I can't, everyone's terrified of him'.\" Why did people refuse to work with him? \"He would lose his temper,\" says Mendoza, \"because eveyone worked on the assumption that he was mad and unreasonable. And it's a fact of life that if you treat people like that they become mad and unreasonable don't they?\" </p> <p>Some people said that despite Jennings's sympathy for working-class people, he was a typical intellectual, too abstracted and remote to get on with people. His daughter, Mary-Lou, said: \"I don't think he was really aware of people at all. I don't think he understood them.\" In his BFI book about Fires Were Started Brian Winston describes him as a \"tall, gangling arrogant cerebral director\". </p> <p>Mendoza says this is an accurate physical description, but it couldn't have been further away from the Jennings he knew. \"He seemed arrogant, but he wasn't. He was just_ Humphrey. He was never 'hail-fellow-well met', never came down to other people's level to communicate. He was always himself.\" Of course, this meant he could be rude because he told you things straight. </p> <p> Mendoza believes Jennings's greatest gift was his ability to listen. \"You always knew when he was talking to you that he was interested in what you did and what you said. When people are frightfully clever they tend to look down, but he didn't. Humphrey was a one-off. Did you know his teeth were always green?\" </p> <p>Why? \"I don't know, they were just always green. And his flies were always undone.\" He tells me of the time the Queen appeared as a member of the audience in Listen to Britain. \"She just went up to Humphrey and said 'What would you like me to do, Mr Jennings?', and he said 'Would you just sit here for a few minutes'_ of course, his teeth were green and his flies were undone, but she did as he said. I was going to call him grotesque, but he wasn't. He wasn't deformed, he was just_ highly specialised.\" </p> <p>It seems that Jennings tortured the brilliant performances out of his actors. He withheld the script and forced them to improvise, repeated a single scene till they were oblivious to the camera. Fred Griffiths, who played one of the firemen, recalled how Jennings made them sing One Man Went to Mow all day long. \"I've started at 8.30 in the morning, and we go on singing all the way through. At 5pm - cut. He comes over to me, he says, 'I think your voice is going'. I'd been singing for nine hours, and he said, 'Your voice is going'.\" </p> <p>This was documentary in the broadest sense. Although not strictly true, the film was \"a creative treatment of actuality\", the criterion Grierson had used to distinguish documentaries from newsreel footage. </p> <p>The director Lindsay Anderson said, \"No other film made during the war, documentary or feature, achieved such a continuous and poignant truthfulness, or treated the subject of men at war with such a sense of its incidental glories and its essential tragedy.\" Anderson argued that Jennings' wartime work \"will speak to us for posterity, saying, 'This is what it was like. This is what we were like - the best of us.' \" </p> <p>Despite the success of Fires Were Started, Jennings never made another feature film. Mendoza blames the hostility of his peer group. \"Film people are very harsh and critical and most are arrogant. They couldn't understand someone like Humphrey.\" He talks about how other film-makers treated them as an obscure joke, how they were nicknamed the Half Crown Unit because \"what we spent on a film would just about cover their tea bill for one unit\". </p> <p>Humphrey Jennings died in 1950, aged 43. He was on location when he fell to his death. Most people said it was an accident, some suggested it was suicide. Mendoza says the idea he would have killed himself is ludicrous. \"I know what Humphrey was like. I can just see it now - he was on a recce, and he thought maybe if we put the camera here, and he had one eye on the sun, and he wasn't looking where he was going. He fell off the cliff. Typical Humphrey, really.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Humphrey Jennings season runs throughout the month at the National Film Theatre, London SE1. Box office: 0171-928 3232.</p>",

What emerged most powerfully was stoicism, a togetherness that transcended class and social differences, however temporarily. Few people could bare to work with Jennings. Joe Mendoza says: \"He used to get through two assistant directors a film. I was 19 when they asked me to work with him and I wept. I said 'I can't, everyone's terrified of him'.\" Why did people refuse to work with him? \"He would lose his temper,\" says Mendoza, \"because eveyone worked on the assumption that he was mad and unreasonable. And it's a fact of life that if you treat people like that they become mad and unreasonable don't they?\" Some people said that despite Jennings's sympathy for working-class people, he was a typical intellectual, too abstracted and remote to get on with people. His daughter, Mary-Lou, said: \"I don't think he was really aware of people at all. I don't think he understood them.\" In his BFI book about Fires Were Started Brian Winston describes him as a \"tall, gangling arrogant cerebral director\". Mendoza says this is an accurate physical description, but it couldn't have been further away from the Jennings he knew. \"He seemed arrogant, but he wasn't. He was just_ Humphrey. He was never 'hail-fellow-well met', never came down to other people's level to communicate. He was always himself.\" Of course, this meant he could be rude because he told you things straight. Mendoza believes Jennings's greatest gift was his ability to listen. \"You always knew when he was talking to you that he was interested in what you did and what you said. When people are frightfully clever they tend to look down, but he didn't. Humphrey was a one-off. Did you know his teeth were always green?\" Why? \"I don't know, they were just always green. And his flies were always undone.\" He tells me of the time the Queen appeared as a member of the audience in Listen to Britain. \"She just went up to Humphrey and said 'What would you like me to do, Mr Jennings?', and he said 'Would you just sit here for a few minutes'_ of course, his teeth were green and his flies were undone, but she did as he said. I was going to call him grotesque, but he wasn't. He wasn't deformed, he was just_ highly specialised.\" It seems that Jennings tortured the brilliant performances out of his actors. He withheld the script and forced them to improvise, repeated a single scene till they were oblivious to the camera. Fred Griffiths, who played one of the firemen, recalled how Jennings made them sing One Man Went to Mow all day long. \"I've started at 8.30 in the morning, and we go on singing all the way through. At 5pm - cut. He comes over to me, he says, 'I think your voice is going'. I'd been singing for nine hours, and he said, 'Your voice is going'.\" This was documentary in the broadest sense. Although not strictly true, the film was \"a creative treatment of actuality\", the criterion Grierson had used to distinguish documentaries from newsreel footage. The director Lindsay Anderson said, \"No other film made during the war, documentary or feature, achieved such a continuous and poignant truthfulness, or treated the subject of men at war with such a sense of its incidental glories and its essential tragedy.\" Anderson argued that Jennings' wartime work \"will speak to us for posterity, saying, 'This is what it was like. This is what we were like - the best of us.' \" Despite the success of Fires Were Started, Jennings never made another feature film. Mendoza blames the hostility of his peer group. \"Film people are very harsh and critical and most are arrogant. They couldn't understand someone like Humphrey.\" He talks about how other film-makers treated them as an obscure joke, how they were nicknamed the Half Crown Unit because \"what we spent on a film would just about cover their tea bill for one unit\". Humphrey Jennings died in 1950, aged 43. He was on location when he fell to his death. Most people said it was an accident, some suggested it was suicide. Mendoza says the idea he would have killed himself is ludicrous. \"I know what Humphrey was like. I can just see it now - he was on a recce, and he thought maybe if we put the camera here, and he had one eye on the sun, and he wasn't looking where he was going. He fell off the cliff. Typical Humphrey, really.\" \u0095 The Humphrey Jennings season runs throughout the month at the National Film Theatre, London SE1. Box office: 0171-928 3232.",

      "body": "<p>The baby born today, living an average life, as an inhabitant of whatever we continue to call these islands, could breeze right through the 21st century. He or she could enjoy half a dozen different careers. She could become friends with robots. She could be kept safe from cancer. Her world could become faster, smarter, more minutely detailed and driven by the market than it is currently possible to imagine. There could be silicon chips in her blouse collars, security codes in her smallest trinkets, electronic servants always sifting and choosing and facilitating. She could do a lot of reclining. She could stay slightly pudgy.</p> <p>On the other hand, she could be living in a commune. The countryside around could be drought-struck or flooded. Consumption could be rationed. Cash and crime could be abolished, religion restored to dominance, neighbours her only close friends. Slowness and silence could rule: the 19th and 20th centuries could seem like aberrations, the rush for economic expansion as rational as gambling. The millennium baby could grow up calmer than most people are today, slimmer, more sated, more seasonal, more fatalistic. Outside the commune gates, plague victims could be wandering.</p> <p>Or neither of these lives could unfurl at all. \"It is impossible to predict the future,\" wrote Arthur C Clarke, the twinkly veteran of science fiction and, well, futurology, towards the end of last year. \"All attempts to do so in any detail appear ludicrous within a very few years.\" But the ambition is as irresistible as it is foolish. In the 1950s, the prospect for our baby was all silvery vistas; in the 70s, it was fuel exhaustion and catastrophes; in the early 90s, it was subservience to the far east. Only six years ago, the much-praised Yale historian Paul Kennedy wrote a book called Preparing For The Twenty-First Century, which predicted, with the aid of many sober bar charts, the economic eclipse of the United States. These days, almost every business magazine and think tank foresees the opposite: the creation of a sort of global California, competitive and bright and a bit lonely - our baby, from school-age on, enduring endless homework and weekend work and keyboard hum and clatter.</p> <p>How he or she will earn and spend is the main concern of the best-known British forecasters such as the Future Foundation and the Henley Centre, which profitably sell their research to corporations and publicise it through the media with ad-man's rhymes and alliterations. Our baby, they suggest, will come to favour \"Hedged Hedonism\" (planning indulgences); or to think \"Vice is Nice\" (relishing naughty purchases); or to believe in \"Moral Money\" (ethical spending).</p> <p>Trickier or more overtly political matters, like whether poor Britons will behave likewise, or how Britons of different types will get along, feature much less in the futurologists' shiny reports. Will the millennium baby remain a citizen of the European Union? The man from the Henley Centre gives an awkward laugh, a pause, and mutters quickly about \"not getting into Mystic Meg stuff\".</p> <p>Yet the lifespan of our baby, almost every forecaster agrees, will make the 20th century seem glacial. Decades will be as busy as centuries; the family as we know it, the way we communicate or travel or use our talents - all of these, in rich countries like Britain at least, will alter \"unprecedentedly\".</p> <p>By 2010, our baby will be able to have a robot pet, or an artificial heart. By 2020, she will be expecting to live to 100; by 2030, to be in brain-to-brain contact, via electronic implants, without needing to speak, with family members and lovers and friends. By the end of the 21st century, says Professor Richard Gregory of Bristol University, it is not clear \"whether we will be people or robots\". In old age, our subject may be a hybrid of silicon and flesh, or a mere electronic presence, discarding each worn and scuffed body as necessary. Our baby's great-great-grandchildren may be learning about the old ways of birth, and bodily growth and decay and mess, from their hologram of a history teacher.</p> <p>Other physical limits, though, will probably still rule our baby's life. For a start, she will have to get used to less space. The British population, according to the office of national statistics, will swell from 60m now to 64m in 2021, then continue to grow steadily until at least 2036. Different parts of Britain will be differently affected: Scotland is expected to lose population; Wales and Northern Ireland may gain it for the next three decades only; England is expected to go on accumulating well beyond that.</p> <p>London will be the most prominent and controversial importer of Britons, but East Anglia, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire will draw people too. The \"south-east\" as we now know it could expand as far west as Cardiff and as far north as Northampton. Our baby, like everyone else, will need to be where the jobs are - working at home will probably only be practical part of the time. She had better learn to like mini-roundabouts.</p> <p>And buildings. Britain's cities, as far as they can be told apart from the thickening mesh of suburbs, will feel denser and noisier. Growing up in a flat, in an urban land scape, will cease to be solely the experience of the poor and fashionable. Having foreign neighbours, as rich Europe continues to bind itself closer, will become unremarkable. Having neighbours of a different skin tone may be almost universal: in London, the commission for racial equality predicts, the white population will fall from three-quarters now to perhaps half the total; in other cities, the greater youth and higher birth rates of non-white Britain will also tell. Mixed relationships will continue to be popular. Arranged ones will become less so. The millennium baby, most likely, will have to grow up more open than we are about other races and beliefs and behaviours.</p> <p>She will need to be nice to old people, too. There will be many more of them. With the average life expectancy lengthening currently by two or three years a decade, the proportion of Britons aged over 65 could rise by up to a fifth by 2020. The number of people over 85 could almost double. The whole status of being \"old\" will probably change: pensioners will have more political power, and a greater share of the national wealth. And the point of complete retirement may recede, to 70 or 80 or beyond.</p> <p>The conventional landmarks of our baby's life will come later too. She may study until the age of 25; the extra years will probably not be frittered away, doing re-takes or down the pub, but will bustle with careers seminars and vocational modules and conscientious note-taking on company-sponsored A4 pads. Marriage, if it comes, will usually be well after 30.</p> <p>Home-buying, as southern English properties grow ever tinier and more precious, may be later still. As for children, well, the millennium baby may turn into far too career-hungry an adult for that, and her partner likewise, until perhaps their mid-40s. And parenting may be just an interlude, until the traditional 21st-century shift of career in her mid-50s, and again in her early 70s.</p> <p>Away from such responsibilities, meanwhile, the ties between age and taste may loosen to nothing: rock stars will unashamedly chug through the decades with their audiences; in reaction, teenagers may come to covet the most fogeyish clothing brands. Our baby may end up in tweed skirt at 16 and tight denim at 60.</p> <p>Better health will be behind all this. In Britain at least, the 21st century is confidently expected to eradicate cancer, many handicaps, even Aids. Our baby will acquire artificial body parts: not just substitute limbs and contact lenses, but brain implants to quicken memory and communication, eye implants if fuzziness or blindness threatens, or for peering into electronic worlds, and replacement organs that require no donors.</p> <p>All this may sound a little over-ambitious; but these very advances are the present-day research projects of profit-sensing corporations. Gene therapy, where human DNA is manipulated before birth to prevent the development of harmful conditions, may be practical within this decade. The cloning, or genetic copying, of human tissue and organs is also close to possible. The use of microscopic robots to repair the body from within, without incision, is promised by 2020.</p> <p>Remote-control medicine is coming too: clothes and wristwatches will monitor patients, and convey the details to their doctors or hospitals. Surgeons, in turn, will examine people electronically from afar, or guide local technicians through operations. Fabrics that treat minor wounds without any human intervention are envisaged.</p> <p>Not every medical development need be benign, though. Genetic manipulation, for example, could make our baby into a tyrannically choosy parent. The slightest imperfection - or dot of individuality - could be eradicated from an embryo. As our baby lives a self-improving life, accepting transplants and plastic surgery and painful weeks of readjustment, so she may well expect the same of her offspring, in the womb even, or earlier. Certain standards for future babies, of likely fertility, say, or diligence or intelligence, may be imposed by governments.</p> <p>Or the millennium baby may learn medicine's limits. Already, \"the great age of antibiotics\", as the science writer Matt Ridley calls it, is over: \"If we are to keep infectious disease at bay we must invent new chemicals... Unfortunately, that looks increasingly difficult. The rate of invention... has slowed down measurably.\" Bacteria always adapt and outflank. New diseases will appear, taking advantage of the end of vaccination programmes that defeated others.</p> <p>The ever wider and busier patterns of human travel will help them spread. That adventure holiday our baby took in Tanzania in 2026 may come, 10 years later, to be seen as the moment some grave new tropical ailment arrived in Basingstoke. And by then Berkshire may feel a bit like the tropics. Global warming may have made the summer air stickier, the spring and autumn warmer, the winter wetter and shorter.</p> <p>Some forecasters predict coastal flooding, in the south-east in particular, and faster erosion right up the east coast, as the polar icecaps dissolve and sea levels rise. There may be more marshland; there may be malarial mosquitoes. On blazing June days, our baby may prefer to stay sealed indoors, rather than fling open the windows.</p> <p>She will be more careful with water. The sheer quantity of new suburbs, and their appetite for lush lawns and twin bathrooms, could strain a water infrastructure designed for less demanding times. Piping water in from wetter areas will be expensive and - a sign of politics to come - could be controversial. More obviously than now, the new Britain will be composed of competing regions, with diverging economies and ways of living. Where people live, and the natural resources they use, and how they travel, will be less and less matters of easy national cooperation.</p> <p>As the council for the protection of rural England sees it, our baby will gradually, grumpily realise that the rural idyll - as a place to live, rather than a place to visit - is an impossible fantasy. Instead, on rare days off, she may drive out to an \"area of tranquillity\". These enclaves in the countryside, where cars and industrial farming practices are barred, will be like Victorian city parks: places to wander and flirt and experience \"nature\", exhaustively maintained by human hands.</p> <p>The majority of Britain will be less restful. The optimists see a country built on silicon: roads murmuring with computer-driven traffic, intelligent homes where kitchen appliances anticipate shortages, flats and houses cunningly designed for every available slice of land. Pessimists see gridlock and redbrick on every hillside. Either way, the natural world will probably seem more distant: just the drift of clouds, most of the time, the other side of the double-glazing.</p> <p>What sort of emotional life will our baby lead in this indoor, circuit-regulated world? Who will she choose to be fond of? Most futurologists, contrary to the frettings of conservatives, still favour the family. Not the nuclear version, of two parents cocooned with their children, which rose, and is now falling, with western industrialisation, but a looser and more inclusive set of domestic arrangements. As people live and work for longer, grandparents and extended families will become more active and important. Marriage will continue to lose popularity, but its definition will broaden, to cover same-sex couples and even time-limited arrangements, subject to renewal and renegotiation. The number of unmarried people living together will grow swiftly, from less than a tenth of the population now to approaching a seventh in 2010.</p> <p>Home life will not be busy and warm for everybody, though. Over a third of households will be solitary ones. Our subject, very likely, will have this status at some point, at least. New ways of linking people may be needed: shared living spaces in blocks of flats, perhaps, and more \"third places\" - cafes and other refuges from the home and work place, where people can loiter and meet in the daytime and at weekends without heavy pressure to spend. The Henley Centre bluntly predicts: \"Invest in dating agencies.\"</p> <p>New technology will aid the lonely too. The internet is a perfect medium for the like-minded but isolated. This decade, connection to it will become almost as common as owning a telephone. The number of online clubs and societies, and the possibilities for electronic friendships and intimacies, will swell accordingly. And the millennium baby may not have to confine herself to the company of humans. By 2019, says Ray Kurzweil, a much-praised American expert on artificial intelligence, \"The vast majority of transactions [will] include a simulated person, featuring a realistic animated personality and two-way voice communication.\" Wilder theorists of software and robotics visualise sexual pleasure transmitted from circuit boards to human nerves, orgasms by e-mail, even romance between metal and flesh.</p> <p>At home and in the workplace, computers will stop being bulky beige boxes on tabletops. Instead, they will be everywhere: in every room our baby uses, in her means of transport, mobile phone, clothes; in constant contact with other computers, responsive to her voice or even mere thought, smoothly easing her through her daily tasks, between the distracting storms of other people's data.</p> <p>There will be drawbacks. Our baby will be watched from birth; more and more activities and movements and personal details will be memorised and stored. Databases will be connected and scrutinised by governments and criminals. A forecaster at British Telecom says, \"The concept of not being tracked... of being out of touch, will be as difficult for people to grasp as the idea of renouncing one's own identity: it will be meaningless.\" At times, at the very least, all this instant communication will give our baby a headache. At other times, she may worry about being swamped by the babble, about losing her identity. Mostly, she will probably be too tired.</p> <p>Or excited. By the time the millennium baby is a teenager, the possibilities for consumption and cultural experience could be close to infinite. Online shopping could be more dizzying than the greatest mall. Archives of, say, paintings, or live performances could be instantly available. Shops, electronic or otherwise, may never close. The Henley Centre's word for 21st-century taste - \"polyglotting\" - anticipates constantly roving, shifting preferences, not from year to year or decade to decade, but from hour to hour, even minute to minute.</p> <p>She will eat sushi and Mars bars, dress all-American then, like a country lady, chase minimalist coffee tables and junk-shop kitsch. Sheer fickleness, and the ability to satisfy it, will be a thrill for a while. Then it will be time to invest in an electronic filter. The most common prediction is for \"choice editors\", either software programs or actual computers, which will sift and recommend according to instructions. At their simplest, these will scour the internet for, say, cheap flights; more complicatedly, they will choose furniture and clothes based on previous purchases, perhaps even to fit an unspoken self-image.</p> <p>Flesh-and-blood advice will also become more important. Friends and colleagues' recommendations will be trusted and followed, as a means of delegating choices. Shop assistants and established brands will be regarded with less reverence. Our baby, even if otherwise unpolitical, may well take part in revolts against particular products and corporations, motivated by ethics or simply price. Bathed in the low grey glow of paper-thin computer screen, indoors in the warm, with hundreds of comrades electronically at hand, all sorts of brave gestures will be possible.</p> <p>Occasionally, too, she will still venture outside to \"go shopping\". Not in the old daily or weekly sense, but to linger over purchases, to stare at fellow consumers, to enjoy retail \"experiences\" as a kind of theme park or theatre. More mundane consumption will be electronic; supermarkets may be reduced to warehouses and delivery networks. New ways of receiving goods at home will be needed: perhaps our subject's house will have a special porch, the Henley Centre speculates, with an entry code given out to the deliveryman. Or maybe the nearest corner shop will become a depot, minding deliveries, for a small fee, until she stumbles red-eyed away from the office.</p> <p>That could be pretty late. She will most likely do more than us. The computerised house and helpers, new communications gadgets, generally more flexible lives - beneath all these predictions lies the assumption that work will demand more attention and time.</p> <p>This assumption, like most of those underlying British forecasting, is very American. French and German companies are currently cutting hours, but Britain has been developing transatlantic work habits for decades. Some of these will be self-reinforcing: the more time she spends at her desk, and at company social events, and slipping into the office on Sunday mornings, the less she will be able or inclined to sustain other interests. If she stays single, all the better for her output.</p> <p>And if our baby should remain a student, or become a welfare claimant, she will be encouraged to work as well, by financial necessity and the hustling of governments. This is unlikely to involve making anything. By 2010, four-fifths of British jobs are expected to be in services, many of them in performing domestic tasks for others so that they can do more work. The millennium baby may well end up booking tickets and unravelling parking fines for other, even busier people. Back at home, in her small, humming flat, someone else could be doing the same for her.</p> <p>Career switches will be more frequent. Training will be a constant requirement. Surveillance and frequent assessments will enforce diligence. And all the while, computers will keep leapfrogging parts of the workforce. \"If your job title contains the word agent,\" say the British Telecom forecasters, \"it is at risk now.\" Later this century, they speculate, people who process information for a living, like management consultants and journalists, may become obsolete as well. Computers will do it faster, more continuously, and with increasing subtlety. The only safe group may be people with \"caring roles\", like nurses and counsellors, who \"are valued because they are people, and their output is basically human interaction\".</p> <p>Millennium baby may not keep up. And the state will probably provide diminishing protection from the whirrings of the new economy. By 2010, says the Future Foundation, two-thirds of Britons will be paying for health insurance. The state pension will be something for historians. Benefits will be a tiny fraction of average earnings. Education will be part-privatised: corporations running schools in \"difficult\" areas.</p> <p>For self-improving people, this more demanding, less patient welfare state may work well; for the unmotivated or most vulnerable, it may barely help at all. From pre-school, our millennium baby may be captivated by all the computers and virtual teachers and vast archives of stored knowledge. She may, on the other hand, become an \"exclusion\".</p> <p>Illicit career paths will still beckon. The more things there are to buy, the more there will be to steal. Illegal drugs - and few forecast their legitimisation - will most likely still be profitable. Prisons will probably continue to breed better-trained criminals.</p> <p>\"The outlook is gloomy,\" says Stephen Tumin, the former chief inspector of prisons. He envisages \"overcrowding, and cutting of staff and budgets... [Inmates] will be deprived of the education and psychiatric help they need.\" Jails may all become \"industrial\": privately-run, profit-making factories with captive workforces, their products sold to the public, their wages forcibly directed to prisoners' dependants.</p> <p>If our baby turns out law-abiding, she may welcome all this. Twenty-first century Britain, for all its predicted energy, may seem jittery, culturally fragmented; the authoritarian may reassure. She may grow used to barred downstairs windows, a gate at the end of the road, local rules against \"antisocial\" behaviour, a private security guard. She may take refuge in religion. Amid the apparent chaos that tends to accompany change, the historian Felipe Fernandez-Armesto argues, science and rationalism will accumulate doubters. All creeds and belief systems will come to seem equally questionable - to religion's advantage.</p> <p>Or perhaps our baby will grow into a pragmatist, holding lots of contradictory ideas at once, and choosing according to mood and situation, just as she does in the online shopping catalogues.

      "bodyText": "The baby born today, living an average life, as an inhabitant of whatever we continue to call these islands, could breeze right through the 21st century. He or she could enjoy half a dozen different careers. She could become friends with robots. She could be kept safe from cancer. Her world could become faster, smarter, more minutely detailed and driven by the market than it is currently possible to imagine. There could be silicon chips in her blouse collars, security codes in her smallest trinkets, electronic servants always sifting and choosing and facilitating. She could do a lot of reclining. She could stay slightly pudgy. On the other hand, she could be living in a commune. The countryside around could be drought-struck or flooded. Consumption could be rationed. Cash and crime could be abolished, religion restored to dominance, neighbours her only close friends. Slowness and silence could rule: the 19th and 20th centuries could seem like aberrations, the rush for economic expansion as rational as gambling. The millennium baby could grow up calmer than most people are today, slimmer, more sated, more seasonal, more fatalistic. Outside the commune gates, plague victims could be wandering. Or neither of these lives could unfurl at all. \"It is impossible to predict the future,\" wrote Arthur C Clarke, the twinkly veteran of science fiction and, well, futurology, towards the end of last year. \"All attempts to do so in any detail appear ludicrous within a very few years.\" But the ambition is as irresistible as it is foolish. In the 1950s, the prospect for our baby was all silvery vistas; in the 70s, it was fuel exhaustion and catastrophes; in the early 90s, it was subservience to the far east. Only six years ago, the much-praised Yale historian Paul Kennedy wrote a book called Preparing For The Twenty-First Century, which predicted, with the aid of many sober bar charts, the economic eclipse of the United States. These days, almost every business magazine and think tank foresees the opposite: the creation of a sort of global California, competitive and bright and a bit lonely - our baby, from school-age on, enduring endless homework and weekend work and keyboard hum and clatter. How he or she will earn and spend is the main concern of the best-known British forecasters such as the Future Foundation and the Henley Centre, which profitably sell their research to corporations and publicise it through the media with ad-man's rhymes and alliterations. Our baby, they suggest, will come to favour \"Hedged Hedonism\" (planning indulgences); or to think \"Vice is Nice\" (relishing naughty purchases); or to believe in \"Moral Money\" (ethical spending). Trickier or more overtly political matters, like whether poor Britons will behave likewise, or how Britons of different types will get along, feature much less in the futurologists' shiny reports. Will the millennium baby remain a citizen of the European Union? The man from the Henley Centre gives an awkward laugh, a pause, and mutters quickly about \"not getting into Mystic Meg stuff\". Yet the lifespan of our baby, almost every forecaster agrees, will make the 20th century seem glacial. Decades will be as busy as centuries; the family as we know it, the way we communicate or travel or use our talents - all of these, in rich countries like Britain at least, will alter \"unprecedentedly\". By 2010, our baby will be able to have a robot pet, or an artificial heart. By 2020, she will be expecting to live to 100; by 2030, to be in brain-to-brain contact, via electronic implants, without needing to speak, with family members and lovers and friends. By the end of the 21st century, says Professor Richard Gregory of Bristol University, it is not clear \"whether we will be people or robots\". In old age, our subject may be a hybrid of silicon and flesh, or a mere electronic presence, discarding each worn and scuffed body as necessary. Our baby's great-great-grandchildren may be learning about the old ways of birth, and bodily growth and decay and mess, from their hologram of a history teacher. Other physical limits, though, will probably still rule our baby's life. For a start, she will have to get used to less space. The British population, according to the office of national statistics, will swell from 60m now to 64m in 2021, then continue to grow steadily until at least 2036. Different parts of Britain will be differently affected: Scotland is expected to lose population; Wales and Northern Ireland may gain it for the next three decades only; England is expected to go on accumulating well beyond that. London will be the most prominent and controversial importer of Britons, but East Anglia, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire will draw people too. The \"south-east\" as we now know it could expand as far west as Cardiff and as far north as Northampton. Our baby, like everyone else, will need to be where the jobs are - working at home will probably only be practical part of the time. She had better learn to like mini-roundabouts. And buildings. Britain's cities, as far as they can be told apart from the thickening mesh of suburbs, will feel denser and noisier. Growing up in a flat, in an urban land scape, will cease to be solely the experience of the poor and fashionable. Having foreign neighbours, as rich Europe continues to bind itself closer, will become unremarkable. Having neighbours of a different skin tone may be almost universal: in London, the commission for racial equality predicts, the white population will fall from three-quarters now to perhaps half the total; in other cities, the greater youth and higher birth rates of non-white Britain will also tell. Mixed relationships will continue to be popular. Arranged ones will become less so. The millennium baby, most likely, will have to grow up more open than we are about other races and beliefs and behaviours. She will need to be nice to old people, too. There will be many more of them. With the average life expectancy lengthening currently by two or three years a decade, the proportion of Britons aged over 65 could rise by up to a fifth by 2020. The number of people over 85 could almost double. The whole status of being \"old\" will probably change: pensioners will have more political power, and a greater share of the national wealth. And the point of complete retirement may recede, to 70 or 80 or beyond. The conventional landmarks of our baby's life will come later too. She may study until the age of 25; the extra years will probably not be frittered away, doing re-takes or down the pub, but will bustle with careers seminars and vocational modules and conscientious note-taking on company-sponsored A4 pads. Marriage, if it comes, will usually be well after 30. Home-buying, as southern English properties grow ever tinier and more precious, may be later still. As for children, well, the millennium baby may turn into far too career-hungry an adult for that, and her partner likewise, until perhaps their mid-40s. And parenting may be just an interlude, until the traditional 21st-century shift of career in her mid-50s, and again in her early 70s. Away from such responsibilities, meanwhile, the ties between age and taste may loosen to nothing: rock stars will unashamedly chug through the decades with their audiences; in reaction, teenagers may come to covet the most fogeyish clothing brands. Our baby may end up in tweed skirt at 16 and tight denim at 60. Better health will be behind all this. In Britain at least, the 21st century is confidently expected to eradicate cancer, many handicaps, even Aids. Our baby will acquire artificial body parts: not just substitute limbs and contact lenses, but brain implants to quicken memory and communication, eye implants if fuzziness or blindness threatens, or for peering into electronic worlds, and replacement organs that require no donors. All this may sound a little over-ambitious; but these very advances are the present-day research projects of profit-sensing corporations. Gene therapy, where human DNA is manipulated before birth to prevent the development of harmful conditions, may be practical within this decade. The cloning, or genetic copying, of human tissue and organs is also close to possible. The use of microscopic robots to repair the body from within, without incision, is promised by 2020. Remote-control medicine is coming too: clothes and wristwatches will monitor patients, and convey the details to their doctors or hospitals. Surgeons, in turn, will examine people electronically from afar, or guide local technicians through operations. Fabrics that treat minor wounds without any human intervention are envisaged. Not every medical development need be benign, though. Genetic manipulation, for example, could make our baby into a tyrannically choosy parent. The slightest imperfection - or dot of individuality - could be eradicated from an embryo. As our baby lives a self-improving life, accepting transplants and plastic surgery and painful weeks of readjustment, so she may well expect the same of her offspring, in the womb even, or earlier. Certain standards for future babies, of likely fertility, say, or diligence or intelligence, may be imposed by governments. Or the millennium baby may learn medicine's limits. Already, \"the great age of antibiotics\", as the science writer Matt Ridley calls it, is over: \"If we are to keep infectious disease at bay we must invent new chemicals... Unfortunately, that looks increasingly difficult. The rate of invention... has slowed down measurably.\" Bacteria always adapt and outflank. New diseases will appear, taking advantage of the end of vaccination programmes that defeated others. The ever wider and busier patterns of human travel will help them spread. That adventure holiday our baby took in Tanzania in 2026 may come, 10 years later, to be seen as the moment some grave new tropical ailment arrived in Basingstoke. And by then Berkshire may feel a bit like the tropics. Global warming may have made the summer air stickier, the spring and autumn warmer, the winter wetter and shorter. Some forecasters predict coastal flooding, in the south-east in particular, and faster erosion right up the east coast, as the polar icecaps dissolve and sea levels rise. There may be more marshland; there may be malarial mosquitoes. On blazing June days, our baby may prefer to stay sealed indoors, rather than fling open the windows. She will be more careful with water. The sheer quantity of new suburbs, and their appetite for lush lawns and twin bathrooms, could strain a water infrastructure designed for less demanding times. Piping water in from wetter areas will be expensive and - a sign of politics to come - could be controversial. More obviously than now, the new Britain will be composed of competing regions, with diverging economies and ways of living. Where people live, and the natural resources they use, and how they travel, will be less and less matters of easy national cooperation. As the council for the protection of rural England sees it, our baby will gradually, grumpily realise that the rural idyll - as a place to live, rather than a place to visit - is an impossible fantasy. Instead, on rare days off, she may drive out to an \"area of tranquillity\". These enclaves in the countryside, where cars and industrial farming practices are barred, will be like Victorian city parks: places to wander and flirt and experience \"nature\", exhaustively maintained by human hands. The majority of Britain will be less restful. The optimists see a country built on silicon: roads murmuring with computer-driven traffic, intelligent homes where kitchen appliances anticipate shortages, flats and houses cunningly designed for every available slice of land. Pessimists see gridlock and redbrick on every hillside. Either way, the natural world will probably seem more distant: just the drift of clouds, most of the time, the other side of the double-glazing. What sort of emotional life will our baby lead in this indoor, circuit-regulated world? Who will she choose to be fond of? Most futurologists, contrary to the frettings of conservatives, still favour the family. Not the nuclear version, of two parents cocooned with their children, which rose, and is now falling, with western industrialisation, but a looser and more inclusive set of domestic arrangements. As people live and work for longer, grandparents and extended families will become more active and important. Marriage will continue to lose popularity, but its definition will broaden, to cover same-sex couples and even time-limited arrangements, subject to renewal and renegotiation. The number of unmarried people living together will grow swiftly, from less than a tenth of the population now to approaching a seventh in 2010. Home life will not be busy and warm for everybody, though. Over a third of households will be solitary ones. Our subject, very likely, will have this status at some point, at least. New ways of linking people may be needed: shared living spaces in blocks of flats, perhaps, and more \"third places\" - cafes and other refuges from the home and work place, where people can loiter and meet in the daytime and at weekends without heavy pressure to spend. The Henley Centre bluntly predicts: \"Invest in dating agencies.\" New technology will aid the lonely too. The internet is a perfect medium for the like-minded but isolated. This decade, connection to it will become almost as common as owning a telephone. The number of online clubs and societies, and the possibilities for electronic friendships and intimacies, will swell accordingly. And the millennium baby may not have to confine herself to the company of humans. By 2019, says Ray Kurzweil, a much-praised American expert on artificial intelligence, \"The vast majority of transactions [will] include a simulated person, featuring a realistic animated personality and two-way voice communication.\" Wilder theorists of software and robotics visualise sexual pleasure transmitted from circuit boards to human nerves, orgasms by e-mail, even romance between metal and flesh. At home and in the workplace, computers will stop being bulky beige boxes on tabletops. Instead, they will be everywhere: in every room our baby uses, in her means of transport, mobile phone, clothes; in constant contact with other computers, responsive to her voice or even mere thought, smoothly easing her through her daily tasks, between the distracting storms of other people's data. There will be drawbacks. Our baby will be watched from birth; more and more activities and movements and personal details will be memorised and stored. Databases will be connected and scrutinised by governments and criminals. A forecaster at British Telecom says, \"The concept of not being tracked... of being out of touch, will be as difficult for people to grasp as the idea of renouncing one's own identity: it will be meaningless.\" At times, at the very least, all this instant communication will give our baby a headache.

The Henley Centre's word for 21st-century taste - \"polyglotting\" - anticipates constantly roving, shifting preferences, not from year to year or decade to decade, but from hour to hour, even minute to minute. She will eat sushi and Mars bars, dress all-American then, like a country lady, chase minimalist coffee tables and junk-shop kitsch. Sheer fickleness, and the ability to satisfy it, will be a thrill for a while. Then it will be time to invest in an electronic filter. The most common prediction is for \"choice editors\", either software programs or actual computers, which will sift and recommend according to instructions.

But by midnight on Hogmanay the flicker of torchlight had changed to the blast of fireworks and the party began in earnest. For years, Edinburgh, the city which perhaps more than any other is associated with new year revelry, had been preparing for its millennium celebrations. Many of the 180,000 fortunate enough to get tickets for what was billed as the world's largest organised street party, queued for days to be there. They all appeared to believe it was worth the wait. By mid-morning, police had sealed off the city centre. Shops closed, truck after truck arrived bearing equipment for the concerts and carnival the city had organised. Even the Scottish weather managed to curtail its worst excesses. Throughout the day hundreds skated on the Winter Wonderland ice rink, built in the shadow of the castle. Nearby, families queued to enter a giant inflatable sculpture. In Waterloo Place, even more joined the fairground rides of the Hogmanay carnival. In theatres and comedy clubs, the millennium was marked with sketches and plays. Pubs were packed. It was, said Pete Irvine, the event's organiser, the biggest and most diverse party the city could host. On the streets a multiplicity of accents and languages mingled. There were people from Australia, Europe and the US. Most of them seemed to know the words of Auld Lang Syne more fully than Edinburgh's own citizens. \"The great thing about Edinburgh is that it is an international party: people from around the world as well as from Scotland. It is, we believe, the biggest and best in Britain,\" said Mr Irvine. The royal family was represented by the Prince of Wales, who was greeted in Parliament Square by pipers. Outside the assembly rooms theatre, the Flying Splinter group pulled off a hugely ambitious aerial performance. At Princess Street gardens, Texas, Scotland's most successful band ever, played a concert that had sold out within hours. In all, eight stages and four huge screens broadcast all the city had to offer to those looking for a party - and there were plenty. But the religious significance of the millennium was also acknowledged. At St Giles' cathedral, choral music from Bach and Handel was sung by the cathedral's choir.

      "bodyText": "\"I'm glad I'm living in the land of the free,\" sings Randy Newman, a Los Angeles boy, on his latest album, \"where the rich just get richer and the poor you don't ever have to see.\" As the millennium arrives, perhaps in no other city in the United States is the disparity so obvious. The rich have indeed been getting richer this past year - despite the flight of film production from the city - in relation to the poor who have been always with them, from the bums of the 30s Depression to the homeless with their shopping trolleys today. It is, of course, the hillside sign spelling out the word Hollywood that passes as LA's symbol, so it was only right that this was to be the centrepiece of the celebrations. For the first time since the 1984 Olympics in the city the sign was to be lit up, starting half an hour before midnight. Amid a laser display and images projected on to an artificial fog above the sign, parachutists were set to descend with banners. As befits a city synonymous with the screen, however, the action around the sign was mainly aimed at a television audience and the area was closed to the public. LA was also laying on a number of street parties which seem to emphasise the heterogeneous nature of the city rather than what its citizens might have in common. In the mainly black Crenshaw district, 2,000 gospel singers were lined up to perform; in Olvera Street, a Latino neighbourhood, 2,000 Mexican folk dancers were the lineup; and in the white suburbs of San Fernando valley there were being treated to 2,000 cowboy-booted line dancers. The most spectacular private parties were taking place in the Bel Air and Beverly Hills area - unless their inhabitants decided to pay $100,000 (\u00a362,500) for a ticket to \"Celebrate LA 2000\", the party being held at Paramount Pictures. Frank Sinatra Jnr and the Frank Sinatra Orchestra were doing the music. Wolfgang Puck, a fashionable restaurateur, was doing the food. And actress Geena Davis was to host this benefit party raising money for the Library Foundation. The whole thing was designed by Carl Bendix who has done the same for various governors' balls which are held after the Academy Awards. Only a few were being required to pay the $100,000 \"Superstars\" ticket fee; \"Angels\" could enter for $25,000 and mere mortals for $1,250. The big payers stood to get better seating and special recognition in the programme. Everyone was getting a commemorative medallion. Guests at Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion were unlikely to need a commemorative medallion to help them remember his millennium night party. They were instructed to wear black tie or lingerie. Keeping up the decadence quota, Club Rubber and the Fetish Ball were also offering nights to remember. Many other residents in the canyons long ago decided just to stay put. Actor Freddie Prinze Jr said he was going to sit in his house to \"protect it from crazy looters\" and actress Winona Ryder said she would be underground with a stock of tinned goods because she's paranoid. Some people were hunkering down because they were nervous about the Y2K bug, others about being shot accidentally at a street party: gang members have a tradition of firing salutes into the air. There have been a number of injuries, some fatal, from falling bullets, and police were appealing for the practice to stop on this occasion. In central LA, once described by Raymond Chandler as \"the neon slum\", homeless people from the Dome Village were due to gather on Eighth Street. This little village of prefabricated domes - paid for by the oil and gas giant Atlantic Richfield, whose mighty office tower is just on the other side of the tracks - is home to a floating population of some of the city's 40,000 homeless. \"We will have a fire barrel, have our beer, dance around and get crazy,\" one of the residents, Ted Hayes, said before the big night. He became homeless in the 80s and has emerged as a spokesman for the city's dispossessed. He even ran as mayor on their behalf. He said he had been turned down for catering work at a millennium party for 500 people because he had dreadlocks; one of his companions had been rejected by the caterers because he had no teeth. Most catering staff were faring not too badly if they were prepared to forgo their night out: the average pay for a six-hour shift was $500 (\u00a3300) instead of the usual $75 to $100. \"This is the most prosperous country in the world and LA is almost the epitome of the American dream,\" said Mr Hayes, sitting in his dome with a portrait of Martin Luther King behind him and a cricket bat by his desk - last summer he helped get a youth team from Los Angeles gang areas to England on an improbable cricket tour. \"You see Beverly Hills, you see the skyscrapers, you see all the wealth on the billboards ... and you also see homeless on the streets eating out of garbage cans.\" Further north, San Francisco - which does not need lessons from anyone in how to let its her hair down - planned to see in the new year in by dropping a 10ft olive down a long swizzle stick into a giant martini atop a hotel in Union Square. The cost of this was put at $250,000. And the morning after? The Optimum Boot Camp is offering a \"new year's resolution\" two-month workout on Malibu Beach which will include kick boxing, obstacle courses and endurance training. Just the job if the apocalypse has happened and the survivalists have taken over.",

But for everyone else, just as the dawn marks the start of a new day, and January 1 announces the start of a new year, so today's dawn opens a new chapter in the human story.</p> <p>We do not wake this morning to a blank slate: there is something deathly in that idea. We wake instead aware of the long past we leave behind. But the turn of the millennium requires us to pause a moment, turn around, and ready ourselves for the future. What will it be? Can we possibly imagine it?</p> <p>The perspective of the lens in space is denied us. The century just gone is too close to disentangle its miracles from its horrors. Even the still beauty of the image is a lie because its gleaming perfection masks the potential for catastrophe.</p> <p>But a millennium offers renewal. \"To make an end is to make a beginning,\" wrote Eliot. \"The end is where we start from.\"</p> <p>Attempting to predict the coming century is more than usually foolish. Even 10 years ago we could not have imagined the internet, the speed of computing (currently doubling every eight or nine months), genetic mapping or cloning. While the mystery of consciousness may elude us for many decades, there are other large areas of our make-up which are about to be revealed. Last month scientists announced the decoding of the first of 23 human chromosomes. It is, as yet, only a rough sketch, but they will be reading the entire genome soon enough, decoding every human characteristic, working out the genes or combinations of genes which are responsible for musicality, schizophrenia, left- handedness, height, athletic prowess and aggression.</p> <p>It feels uncannily as though human beings are finally getting to the roots of the tree of knowledge. No wonder today's scientists feel they are living at the most exciting time in history. While Charles Darwin discovered the probability that we evolved by natural selection, we did not understand the mechanics of that change. Soon we will. We are learning from this string of genetic information what life was for our predecessors, how it works for us - and even catch a glimpse of what we might become. In short, we will read the story life is telling us.</p> <p>This new knowledge will bring untold medical benefits and pose awesome ethical dilemmas. It may be that within two decades traditional surgery will largely be replaced by gene therapy - the injection of chemical messages into diseased or malfunctioning parts of the body. The predisposition to life-threatening diseases in certain patients will also enable doctors to anticipate illness in their patients. The same technology may enable the rich to give their children enormous advantages - enhanced athleticism, height, mathematical ability, the absence of asthma. A scrap of DNA will tell any authority anything they want to know about any person. Who is to determine how this knowledge is used?</p> <p>It is easy to dwell on our fears. The geniuses of genetics have opened Pandora's box. But people forget the end of the story of Pandora. At the bottom of the box was hope, waiting to break out. Our new ability to eat from the tree of life need not trigger a fall from grace. Take, for example, the fears that the science of genetics would revive the science of eugenics and give intellectual underpinning to crude racism. In fact, advanced genetics teaches us not about the biological origins of our differences, but how strikingly similar we all are to each other. Two groups of chimps found 20 miles apart differ more from each other than one human being does from any other, even those who resemble each other least: our brains are remarkably similar. As we open the book of life during the coming millennium, we should see how much we all share - and how bogus are any notions of racial superiority left over from the last century.</p> <p>Nor should we blindly fear the prospect of doctors toying with our genes. We need to keep a vigilant eye on what they do, of course, but we can also afford to look forward to a world where diseases such as muscular dystrophy or Huntington's chorea can be tweezed out before they have ruined a life. Would the world really be worse off if those plagues were banished? And if genetics enables human beings to stay alive for longer, and life becomes less of a risk - with less need for the insurance policy of multiple children relied on in the developing world - then perhaps world population might start to fall, easing some of the strain on the planet.</p> <p>The implications are so vast that we can barely sketch their outline. Where does God, already in retreat after 600 years of modern science, sit in a world where we feel we may one day know the innermost secrets of human existence? Will ours become an entirely godless world? The scientists do not seem to think so. Indeed, some of the most imaginative thinkers speculate that we could eventually discover the concept of right and wrong alongside our genetic instruction manual, that we will realise that the notion of good and evil exists in the universe, as real as the concept of a number: both are real, independent of our perception of them.</p> <p>Cutting-edge studies of physics - of light, energy and matter - can also feed, rather than choke, our mystical impulses. Now that we can describe the entire physical history of the cosmos for all but the first thousandth of a second, scientists have concluded that, in the words of one, \"it looked as if the universe knew we were coming\". Somehow it seemed ready to welcome life. The result is that religion may be different in the new millennium, it may have to speak in a different language, but it will not be dead.</p> <p>The possibilities are thrilling. Space exploration will continue, reaching beyond our solar system to discover... who knows what? Once we have cracked the code for life, will we be able to construct a machine that mirrors it perfectly? Will we crack the riddle of consciousness, so that computers start resembling brains - or will we discover what exactly it is that makes us so different from them? These are just some of the dilemmas that await us.</p> <p>Still, there is a question that has to be solved first, one that underpins all the others. If, uniquely among all the creatures on earth, our evolution is in our own hands - thanks to our understanding of our genes and our mastery of our physical environment - what will we do with it? How will we ensure it is just? And this, tough as it may seem, is not a question we can leave to the experts. This is one for all of us. For there is a risk here that, as science accelerates ever faster, our human institutions fail to catch up. We have the brainpower to see how our lives could be improved beyond our dreams, to be rid of much pain and hardship, yet we struggle to spread these new riches fairly. So scientists develop a treatment for Aids which gives those in America or western Europe once written off as the living dead a new chance of life, and yet Aids still kills millions in Africa. This is not because our scientific creativity hits some conundrum it cannot solve in Africa: it is because one part of the planet is so much poorer than the rest. We could be about to repeat the mistake with genetic medicine. The rich countries of the north may discover how to abolish a raft of hereditary diseases forever, but in the south (or among the poor anywhere) those genes could continue to kill. If the new millennium sees us eating from the tree of knowledge, we need to work out how we can share out the fruit.</p> <p>Our starting point is not easy. We live in a world where economic wealth has grown in ways few ever imagined possible - but where it has become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. Rich countries such as the US are getting fantastically richer, but the poor ones are not just shut out of the new wealth party: they are getting poorer. Life expectancy, so long assumed to be ever-increasing as man and medicine become more sophisticated, is actually falling in the planet's poorest countries. Genetic research may be discovering the secret of making clever babies in London and New York, but in Mali and Malawi children are going blind for lack of basic eye-cream. If science has put humankind's destiny in our own hands, we are getting it horribly wrong.</p> <p>In the past 50 years we have been so concerned with the individual rights, with self-expression and personal liberation that we have quite forgotten what we are doing to the planet in this binge of self-gratification. Capitalism becomes more global; so does the threat to the environment. What were once local problems of pollution have now merged into a huge general threat to the planet's delicately balanced ecosystem. The oceans rise along with the steady increase in global temperatures; the atmosphere is more polluted than at any stage in human history; and hundreds of plant and animal species are becoming extinct. Our need for fuel, food and living space increases every day and yet we do not have the slightest inkling of how we are going to cope as the world's population leaps from 6bn today to 10-12bn through the next century</p> <p>From the industrial revolution until a projected date of 2050, we will have obliterated half the species on earth. Whether it is tiny plants, fungi or insects, we are destroying about 27,000 separate creations a year. It is a programme of devastation unlike anything the globe has witnessed before. Climate change is making the problem worse, with arid areas getting more arid and wet ones getting wetter. Land currently used for farming will become unviable, either too dry or with vital top soil washed away. Some geographers predict a kind of runaway meltdown, as global warming becomes a self-fuelling process, galloping ahead beyond our control. The melting of the glaciers will not solve our other looming problem: a world shortage of water, which could see whole swaths of the Middle East and Asia running dry within 40 years, perhaps warring over H20 the way they once battled for oil.</p> <p>What can we do about this glaring paradox, which has led us to understand ourselves so profoundly and yet still organise our world so badly? Science can offer some help. It may be that a nudge in the direction of genetic modification will eventually be required to avert a food crisis, compensating for the once fertile areas ruined by global warming. Nanotechnology, the use of tiny robots to perform miniature tasks like microsurgery, could also help: the world will consume fewer resources the more adept we become at manipulating matter. The real answer, however, may be globalisation, since even the most highly developed nations seem incapable of addressing the destruction that is going on. Not the globalisation of the world economy, which currently serves to widen the gap between rich and poor, but a new, as yet unformed idea of globalised politics.</p> <p>HG Wells saw the point a century ago: he realised that modern problems are worldwide, requiring worldwide solutions. Only a kind of politics which weighs up the needs of the entire human race could begin to address the water question, for example, insisting that the water-rich countries use no more than they need, while the water-poor get no less than they need. At the moment we do nothing because the problem seems too large or the cause too obstinate. This is because the growth of the most developed economies depends on the pillaging of natural resources. It is a global problem which will eventually have to be sorted out by powerful global institutions, rather than national governments. This will be the only way to prevent the Brazilians from burning their rainforest, the Americans from polluting the atmosphere with their factories and the British from dumping nuclear waste in the oceans. Each nation bears a responsibility for the terrible state of the world's environment at the end of the 20th century, but it is way beyond the powers and will of individual nations to right the damage.</p> <p>The anxiety we may feel about such things might just be alleviated if the west, which has never been richer or economically more self-confident, began to construct a proper programme of third world aid, as well as taking real action on the vehicle and factory emissions, and the pollution of the seas. If we can decode DNA and invent the internet, we should be able to do pretty much do anything. The experience of the past decade in producing global answers to global problems has not been encouraging. Last month's fiasco in Seattle suggested a fatal dislocation between the ambitions of the developed world and the needs of the developing world. Europe has been at peace for more than half a century, but the struggle to establish successful pan-national governmental structures shows the difficulty of reconciling international aspirations with local cultures. The UN security council has so far been unequal to the task of dealing with the problems thrown up after the collapse of the old communist bloc and the consequent erosions of the 19th and 20th century concepts of state sovereignty. The wars in Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda and Chechnya all illustrated the international community's inability to intervene quickly and decisively.</p> <p>But pessimism should be tempered. The emergence of global consumer power, thanks to the internet, could bring a company like Monsanto to its knees. The web is creating new political communities, scattered across the globe, but working together. To hint that all this might one day lead to a global government, democratically elected, sounds laughable now. If anyone had suggested votes for the masses at the beginning of the 19th century they would have been ridiculed, too. But it happened.</p> <p>We need to pull off a shift as profound as that modern move to democracy, this time at the global level. And yet we must still remain mindful of the local. A challenge for the new century is to keep alive the belief that individuals can shape the world around them, whether it is the planet or their village. The new technology can be a friend or foe in this process - daunting us with information overload or enabling us to reach out and connect with others. We need to make sure the internet and its allied innovations work for us, not against us.</p> <p>Where might our own, small island fit into all this? The answer could be quite well. Our mother tongue puts us at the forefront of the web, whose first language is English. We are also neatly situated between the old and new worlds, perfectly placed to be the pivot between Europe and America. In the effort to give birth to a new global awareness, we could be in just the right position. We will need to resolve our dilemma over our relationship with the continent once and for all, and we should do that sooner rather than later. That, in turn, may require a new understanding of Britain itself. In the imperial age it was clear what the union of England, Scotland, Wales and later northern Ireland was for. At the start of the new century, we are much less certain. But we need to work out the purpose of the union if we are not to watch it unravel in the coming decades. Until we do, it is hard to see how we can enter into any other arrangement, with Europe or others, with any self-confidence.</p> <p>So vast changes are ahead of us, perhaps an unending cascade of them. A new relationship between women and men began to emerge in the past century, at least in the developed world. That process of struggle and debate will continue into the new era. But we should embrace it all. For as the scientists will keep telling us, change is in our nature. We are evolutionary creatures, granted a unique ability to ask questions about ourselves. Indeed, it is this very pursuit of understanding which distinguishes us from the animal. We should cherish this fact about ourselves, just as we cherish the intricate beauty of our existence. To quote Eliot once more: \"Last year's words belong to last year's language/And next year's words await another voice.\" We are blessed to live now: let us make this a blessed century and a blessed new millennium.</p>",

Last month scientists announced the decoding of the first of 23 human chromosomes. It is, as yet, only a rough sketch, but they will be reading the entire genome soon enough, decoding every human characteristic, working out the genes or combinations of genes which are responsible for musicality, schizophrenia, left- handedness, height, athletic prowess and aggression. It feels uncannily as though human beings are finally getting to the roots of the tree of knowledge. No wonder today's scientists feel they are living at the most exciting time in history. While Charles Darwin discovered the probability that we evolved by natural selection, we did not understand the mechanics of that change. Soon we will. We are learning from this string of genetic information what life was for our predecessors, how it works for us - and even catch a glimpse of what we might become. In short, we will read the story life is telling us. This new knowledge will bring untold medical benefits and pose awesome ethical dilemmas. It may be that within two decades traditional surgery will largely be replaced by gene therapy - the injection of chemical messages into diseased or malfunctioning parts of the body. The predisposition to life-threatening diseases in certain patients will also enable doctors to anticipate illness in their patients. The same technology may enable the rich to give their children enormous advantages - enhanced athleticism, height, mathematical ability, the absence of asthma. A scrap of DNA will tell any authority anything they want to know about any person. Who is to determine how this knowledge is used? It is easy to dwell on our fears. The geniuses of genetics have opened Pandora's box. But people forget the end of the story of Pandora. At the bottom of the box was hope, waiting to break out. Our new ability to eat from the tree of life need not trigger a fall from grace. Take, for example, the fears that the science of genetics would revive the science of eugenics and give intellectual underpinning to crude racism. In fact, advanced genetics teaches us not about the biological origins of our differences, but how strikingly similar we all are to each other. Two groups of chimps found 20 miles apart differ more from each other than one human being does from any other, even those who resemble each other least: our brains are remarkably similar. As we open the book of life during the coming millennium, we should see how much we all share - and how bogus are any notions of racial superiority left over from the last century. Nor should we blindly fear the prospect of doctors toying with our genes. We need to keep a vigilant eye on what they do, of course, but we can also afford to look forward to a world where diseases such as muscular dystrophy or Huntington's chorea can be tweezed out before they have ruined a life. Would the world really be worse off if those plagues were banished? And if genetics enables human beings to stay alive for longer, and life becomes less of a risk - with less need for the insurance policy of multiple children relied on in the developing world - then perhaps world population might start to fall, easing some of the strain on the planet. The implications are so vast that we can barely sketch their outline. Where does God, already in retreat after 600 years of modern science, sit in a world where we feel we may one day know the innermost secrets of human existence? Will ours become an entirely godless world? The scientists do not seem to think so. Indeed, some of the most imaginative thinkers speculate that we could eventually discover the concept of right and wrong alongside our genetic instruction manual, that we will realise that the notion of good and evil exists in the universe, as real as the concept of a number: both are real, independent of our perception of them. Cutting-edge studies of physics - of light, energy and matter - can also feed, rather than choke, our mystical impulses. Now that we can describe the entire physical history of the cosmos for all but the first thousandth of a second, scientists have concluded that, in the words of one, \"it looked as if the universe knew we were coming\". Somehow it seemed ready to welcome life. The result is that religion may be different in the new millennium, it may have to speak in a different language, but it will not be dead. The possibilities are thrilling. Space exploration will continue, reaching beyond our solar system to discover... who knows what? Once we have cracked the code for life, will we be able to construct a machine that mirrors it perfectly? Will we crack the riddle of consciousness, so that computers start resembling brains - or will we discover what exactly it is that makes us so different from them? These are just some of the dilemmas that await us. Still, there is a question that has to be solved first, one that underpins all the others. If, uniquely among all the creatures on earth, our evolution is in our own hands - thanks to our understanding of our genes and our mastery of our physical environment - what will we do with it? How will we ensure it is just? And this, tough as it may seem, is not a question we can leave to the experts. This is one for all of us. For there is a risk here that, as science accelerates ever faster, our human institutions fail to catch up. We have the brainpower to see how our lives could be improved beyond our dreams, to be rid of much pain and hardship, yet we struggle to spread these new riches fairly. So scientists develop a treatment for Aids which gives those in America or western Europe once written off as the living dead a new chance of life, and yet Aids still kills millions in Africa. This is not because our scientific creativity hits some conundrum it cannot solve in Africa: it is because one part of the planet is so much poorer than the rest. We could be about to repeat the mistake with genetic medicine. The rich countries of the north may discover how to abolish a raft of hereditary diseases forever, but in the south (or among the poor anywhere) those genes could continue to kill. If the new millennium sees us eating from the tree of knowledge, we need to work out how we can share out the fruit. Our starting point is not easy. We live in a world where economic wealth has grown in ways few ever imagined possible - but where it has become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. Rich countries such as the US are getting fantastically richer, but the poor ones are not just shut out of the new wealth party: they are getting poorer. Life expectancy, so long assumed to be ever-increasing as man and medicine become more sophisticated, is actually falling in the planet's poorest countries. Genetic research may be discovering the secret of making clever babies in London and New York, but in Mali and Malawi children are going blind for lack of basic eye-cream. If science has put humankind's destiny in our own hands, we are getting it horribly wrong. In the past 50 years we have been so concerned with the individual rights, with self-expression and personal liberation that we have quite forgotten what we are doing to the planet in this binge of self-gratification. Capitalism becomes more global; so does the threat to the environment. What were once local problems of pollution have now merged into a huge general threat to the planet's delicately balanced ecosystem. The oceans rise along with the steady increase in global temperatures; the atmosphere is more polluted than at any stage in human history; and hundreds of plant and animal species are becoming extinct. Our need for fuel, food and living space increases every day and yet we do not have the slightest inkling of how we are going to cope as the world's population leaps from 6bn today to 10-12bn through the next century From the industrial revolution until a projected date of 2050, we will have obliterated half the species on earth. Whether it is tiny plants, fungi or insects, we are destroying about 27,000 separate creations a year. It is a programme of devastation unlike anything the globe has witnessed before. Climate change is making the problem worse, with arid areas getting more arid and wet ones getting wetter. Land currently used for farming will become unviable, either too dry or with vital top soil washed away. Some geographers predict a kind of runaway meltdown, as global warming becomes a self-fuelling process, galloping ahead beyond our control. The melting of the glaciers will not solve our other looming problem: a world shortage of water, which could see whole swaths of the Middle East and Asia running dry within 40 years, perhaps warring over H20 the way they once battled for oil. What can we do about this glaring paradox, which has led us to understand ourselves so profoundly and yet still organise our world so badly? Science can offer some help. It may be that a nudge in the direction of genetic modification will eventually be required to avert a food crisis, compensating for the once fertile areas ruined by global warming. Nanotechnology, the use of tiny robots to perform miniature tasks like microsurgery, could also help: the world will consume fewer resources the more adept we become at manipulating matter. The real answer, however, may be globalisation, since even the most highly developed nations seem incapable of addressing the destruction that is going on. Not the globalisation of the world economy, which currently serves to widen the gap between rich and poor, but a new, as yet unformed idea of globalised politics. HG Wells saw the point a century ago: he realised that modern problems are worldwide, requiring worldwide solutions. Only a kind of politics which weighs up the needs of the entire human race could begin to address the water question, for example, insisting that the water-rich countries use no more than they need, while the water-poor get no less than they need. At the moment we do nothing because the problem seems too large or the cause too obstinate. This is because the growth of the most developed economies depends on the pillaging of natural resources. It is a global problem which will eventually have to be sorted out by powerful global institutions, rather than national governments. This will be the only way to prevent the Brazilians from burning their rainforest, the Americans from polluting the atmosphere with their factories and the British from dumping nuclear waste in the oceans. Each nation bears a responsibility for the terrible state of the world's environment at the end of the 20th century, but it is way beyond the powers and will of individual nations to right the damage. The anxiety we may feel about such things might just be alleviated if the west, which has never been richer or economically more self-confident, began to construct a proper programme of third world aid, as well as taking real action on the vehicle and factory emissions, and the pollution of the seas. If we can decode DNA and invent the internet, we should be able to do pretty much do anything. The experience of the past decade in producing global answers to global problems has not been encouraging. Last month's fiasco in Seattle suggested a fatal dislocation between the ambitions of the developed world and the needs of the developing world. Europe has been at peace for more than half a century, but the struggle to establish successful pan-national governmental structures shows the difficulty of reconciling international aspirations with local cultures. The UN security council has so far been unequal to the task of dealing with the problems thrown up after the collapse of the old communist bloc and the consequent erosions of the 19th and 20th century concepts of state sovereignty. The wars in Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda and Chechnya all illustrated the international community's inability to intervene quickly and decisively. But pessimism should be tempered. The emergence of global consumer power, thanks to the internet, could bring a company like Monsanto to its knees. The web is creating new political communities, scattered across the globe, but working together. To hint that all this might one day lead to a global government, democratically elected, sounds laughable now. If anyone had suggested votes for the masses at the beginning of the 19th century they would have been ridiculed, too. But it happened. We need to pull off a shift as profound as that modern move to democracy, this time at the global level. And yet we must still remain mindful of the local. A challenge for the new century is to keep alive the belief that individuals can shape the world around them, whether it is the planet or their village. The new technology can be a friend or foe in this process - daunting us with information overload or enabling us to reach out and connect with others. We need to make sure the internet and its allied innovations work for us, not against us. Where might our own, small island fit into all this? The answer could be quite well. Our mother tongue puts us at the forefront of the web, whose first language is English. We are also neatly situated between the old and new worlds, perfectly placed to be the pivot between Europe and America. In the effort to give birth to a new global awareness, we could be in just the right position. We will need to resolve our dilemma over our relationship with the continent once and for all, and we should do that sooner rather than later. That, in turn, may require a new understanding of Britain itself. In the imperial age it was clear what the union of England, Scotland, Wales and later northern Ireland was for. At the start of the new century, we are much less certain. But we need to work out the purpose of the union if we are not to watch it unravel in the coming decades. Until we do, it is hard to see how we can enter into any other arrangement, with Europe or others, with any self-confidence. So vast changes are ahead of us, perhaps an unending cascade of them. A new relationship between women and men began to emerge in the past century, at least in the developed world. That process of struggle and debate will continue into the new era. But we should embrace it all. For as the scientists will keep telling us, change is in our nature. We are evolutionary creatures, granted a unique ability to ask questions about ourselves. Indeed, it is this very pursuit of understanding which distinguishes us from the animal. We should cherish this fact about ourselves, just as we cherish the intricate beauty of our existence. To quote Eliot once more: \"Last year's words belong to last year's language/And next year's words await another voice.\" We are blessed to live now: let us make this a blessed century and a blessed new millennium.",

      "body": "<p>A century of dark or light? Revisionists have lately been emphasising the 20th century's volume of death and destruction but even here, among the body counts, progress has to be recognised. We now know so much more about other societies, the past, especially - the British Institute of Public Opinion (later Gallup) was established in 1937 - ourselves. Never, to coin a phrase, has so much been known about so many.</p> <p>What we don't know, we can find out by phone (3,000 in the UK in 1900, 32.6m now) and thanks to expanded publishers' lists (even today's depleted English public libraries have 30 times the 4.4m volumes stocked in 1906).</p> <p>The capacity for transmitting and acquiring knowledge has exploded through television and telecommunication invented since 1900. And education. In 1902 only 9% of English and Welsh 14-year-olds received full-time schooling; the 20,000 UK students who attended university have become 1.2m; approaching half of all 18-year-olds continue in some form of advanced study.</p> <p>Of course most indices across the century point upwards. More people live in these islands, as on every other land mass around the globe. So we live more densely - though not in Scotland. We travel around more, driving 26.2m cars against 15,900 in 1905. The urban area of England and Wales has doubled though the proportion of total population living in cities has not changed much.</p> <p>We own more. Material possessions abound because the economy has grown - though real GDP per head did not begin its spectacular upwards trajectory till the late 40s. For all the vicissitudes of depression and unemployment, numbers of jobs have grown to provide work for a workforce which grew from 16.3m (1901, Great Britain) to 28m. Meanwhile average output per employee has tripled.</p> <p>Among the fruits of that growth, nearly seven in 10 households now own their own homes compared with one in 10 in 1914. Entire categories of goods and services, holidays to domestic appliances, have been created. Average hours worked have fallen but in Britain far less spectacularly than on the Continent.</p> <p>Some of the new leisure is spent on collective life. We are more democratic: 1900's electorate of 6.7m excluded women and most of the working class; today 40m citizens aged over 18 have the right to vote.</p> <p>As a society, we are healthier, longer lived and more sober - in 1900 a fifth of consumers' spending went on alcohol, now it is about a fourteenth. We are more managerial or managed, depending on viewpoint, with some 7m workers now classed as professional executives. Whether the UK is more European may be politically controversial but it is an economic fact that trade with mainland Europe at 53% of total trade is well above 1900's 37%.</p> <p>Who \"we\" are has changed. At the last census, 500,000 people were labelled as Black Caribbean and 840,000 Indian. In 1901 8,680 were registered as having been born in the West Indies and 55,362 in India and Ceylon. The largest group then living in England and Wales but not born there were Irish.</p> <p>The numerical preponderance of women has fallen - in 1900 there were more women than men in all age groups - but women are now a formidable economic presence outside the home. In 1911, 35% of women were employed; now 71%. Those changes are paralleled by declining family size and later child-bearing.</p> <p>The growth of women earners reflects labour market changes, notably the rise of services and associated part-time employment and the decline of manufacturing. Farming now supplies 1.1% of all jobs against 8.1% in 1911, when a similar proportion was employed in mining and quarrying. Today's manufacturing labour force (17.5%) is just over half 1911's. Manufacturing's decline has cut collective bargaining. In 1900 the Trades Union Congress had 1.25 members and 184 affiliated unions. It waxed then waned and now has 6.75m in 76 unions.</p> <p>Some things do not change much over time - the rate at which the appeal court overturns lower courts, for instance, and the proportion of UK total trade that is carried on with the US (about 12%).</p> <p>Nor has everything grown. At 376,000, the Labour Party's 1900 membership is about the same as its (individual) membership today - though it did grow to over a million individual members in 1950. Whitehall has shrunk. 1900's civil service numbered 779,520 against today's 490,000, although government does occupy a much higher proportion of economic and social space. In 1900 the standard rate of income tax was 8 old pence in the pound - 2%. To spend the extra tax revenue, the size of the cabinet has grown by three from the 19 members it had in 1900 and the number of MPs on the government's \"payroll vote\", key indicator of executive dominance in the legislature, has tripled.</p> <p><b> Now and then</b></p> <p>\u0095 <b>Communication </b> In 1900 there were 3,000 telephones in the UK, today there are 32.6m</p> <p>\u0095<b>Education </b> In 1902 only 9% of English and Welsh 14-year-olds received full-time schooling.

As a society, we are healthier, longer lived and more sober - in 1900 a fifth of consumers' spending went on alcohol, now it is about a fourteenth. We are more managerial or managed, depending on viewpoint, with some 7m workers now classed as professional executives. Whether the UK is more European may be politically controversial but it is an economic fact that trade with mainland Europe at 53% of total trade is well above 1900's 37%. Who \"we\" are has changed. At the last census, 500,000 people were labelled as Black Caribbean and 840,000 Indian. In 1901 8,680 were registered as having been born in the West Indies and 55,362 in India and Ceylon. The largest group then living in England and Wales but not born there were Irish. The numerical preponderance of women has fallen - in 1900 there were more women than men in all age groups - but women are now a formidable economic presence outside the home. In 1911, 35% of women were employed; now 71%. Those changes are paralleled by declining family size and later child-bearing. The growth of women earners reflects labour market changes, notably the rise of services and associated part-time employment and the decline of manufacturing. Farming now supplies 1.1% of all jobs against 8.1% in 1911, when a similar proportion was employed in mining and quarrying. Today's manufacturing labour force (17.5%) is just over half 1911's. Manufacturing's decline has cut collective bargaining. In 1900 the Trades Union Congress had 1.25 members and 184 affiliated unions. It waxed then waned and now has 6.75m in 76 unions. Some things do not change much over time - the rate at which the appeal court overturns lower courts, for instance, and the proportion of UK total trade that is carried on with the US (about 12%). Nor has everything grown. At 376,000, the Labour Party's 1900 membership is about the same as its (individual) membership today - though it did grow to over a million individual members in 1950. Whitehall has shrunk. 1900's civil service numbered 779,520 against today's 490,000, although government does occupy a much higher proportion of economic and social space. In 1900 the standard rate of income tax was 8 old pence in the pound - 2%. To spend the extra tax revenue, the size of the cabinet has grown by three from the 19 members it had in 1900 and the number of MPs on the government's \"payroll vote\", key indicator of executive dominance in the legislature, has tripled. Now and then \u0095 Communication In 1900 there were 3,000 telephones in the UK, today there are 32.6m \u0095Education In 1902 only 9% of English and Welsh 14-year-olds received full-time schooling. Today half of all 18-year-olds are in further education \u0095 Transport There are now 26.2m cars in the UK, compared with 15,900 in 1905 \u0095 Democracy 1900's electorate of 6.7m excluded women and most of the working class; today 40m citizens aged over 18 have the right to vote \u0095Health In 1900 a fifth of consumers' spending went on alcohol, now it is about a fourteenth \u0095 Europe Trade with Europe at 53% of total trade is well above 1900's 37% \u0095Ethnicity At the last census, 500,000 people were labelled as Black Caribbean and 840,000 Indian.

      "body": "<p>Fears of a millennial meltdown caused by computers crashing at the turn of the new century appeared to be receding last night as the first countries to greet 2000 reported no major problems. </p> <p>In New Zealand, the first industrialised country to pass into the new millennium, aviation, telecommunications, electricity and water systems were all working as normal. </p> <p>The Australian government also said no major problems had been reported as the country ticked over into 2000. </p> <p>Japan appeared to enter the new millennium bug free. There were some mobile phone connection problems, but these were related to the usual year-end flood of calls. </p> <p>The millennium bug was born in the 1970s and 80s, when many computers were programmed to read only the last two digits of a year. If the glitch is uncorrected, systems could misread 2000 as 1900, causing malfunctions or even entire systems to crash. </p> <p>Fears had been raised about the safety of Russia's nuclear power plants, but staff at the Bilibinsk nuclear reactor, in Russia's far eastern Chukotka province, opposite Alaska, reported no problems as they ushered in the new year. </p> <p>\"In connection with the change of date, no shutdown in the work of the equipment was observed,\" the Rosenergoatom firm, which manages eight nuclear power plants in Russia said yesterday. </p> <p>Cooperation between Russian and US military experts to ensure that the millennium bug did not trigger a nuclear disaster successfully underwent its first test yesterday.

      "bodyText": "Fears of a millennial meltdown caused by computers crashing at the turn of the new century appeared to be receding last night as the first countries to greet 2000 reported no major problems. In New Zealand, the first industrialised country to pass into the new millennium, aviation, telecommunications, electricity and water systems were all working as normal. The Australian government also said no major problems had been reported as the country ticked over into 2000. Japan appeared to enter the new millennium bug free. There were some mobile phone connection problems, but these were related to the usual year-end flood of calls. The millennium bug was born in the 1970s and 80s, when many computers were programmed to read only the last two digits of a year. If the glitch is uncorrected, systems could misread 2000 as 1900, causing malfunctions or even entire systems to crash. Fears had been raised about the safety of Russia's nuclear power plants, but staff at the Bilibinsk nuclear reactor, in Russia's far eastern Chukotka province, opposite Alaska, reported no problems as they ushered in the new year. \"In connection with the change of date, no shutdown in the work of the equipment was observed,\" the Rosenergoatom firm, which manages eight nuclear power plants in Russia said yesterday. Cooperation between Russian and US military experts to ensure that the millennium bug did not trigger a nuclear disaster successfully underwent its first test yesterday. Military experts from both countries sat side by side at Peterson air force base in Colorado Springs, monitoring nuclear missile launch warning systems to avoid any accident. \"Everything is working smoothly. We're in contact with Moscow all the time,\" US air force Colonel Mike Therrien said. In the US the federal aviation administration acknowledged that it had made a last-minute upgrade to some air traffic control computers. A glitch could have caused controllers' screens to show aircraft positions up to 10 seconds late if two related systems failed during the transition from 1999 to 2000. But a spokesman played down the significance of the problem. \"It is a very, very minor issue,\" he said.",

Dr Michael Martin-Smith Hull \u0095 In 1941, Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali poet, wrote a poem to his friend Satyajit Ray: \"I have spent a fortune travelling to distant shores and looked at lofty mountains and boundless oceans, and yet I haven't found time to take a few steps from my house to look at a single dew drop on a single blade of grass.\" An aspiration for the world is to begin to harness our insatiable appetites for more and more of what is not needed and to slow down and take time to discover that single dew drop. Judith Dell London \u0095 I hope the human race can evolve and realise that armed conflict never solved any of the world's problems. David Reggiori London \u0095 When asked what I am doing \"for the millennium\", I respond I shall be spending most of it in my coffin. Sue Hill Milverton, Somerset \u0095 Happy New Commercial Opportunity. When the new century really begins next year on January 1, 2001, will we go through this palaver again?

      "bodyText": "William Hague's troubles deepened last night when senior officials of the breakaway UK Independence party confirmed that they have been holding exploratory talks with Conservative party members - including MPs such as Teresa Gorman. The MP for Billericay, whose bid to become Tory candidate for mayor of London was quickly crushed by the Hague leadership, was not available for comment yesterday. Supporters in her constituency said they remain confident she will not break from her party. But the UKIP, which has been engulfed in personality quarrels of its own since unexpectedly winning three seats in the European parliament elections last June, said it has held talks with a number of Conservatives who are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the Hague policy of \"in Europe, not run by Europe\". Mr Hague has endured a Christmas buffeting from the Tory left since the defection to Labour of the MP for Witney, Shaun Woodward. But criticisms of Mr Hague's drift to the right by Kenneth Clarke and others are offset by the leadership's concern to win back core voters who defected to the late Sir James Goldsmith's Referendum party in the 1997 general election and to the UKIP in the 1999 European elections. Both did better than expected, despite the increasingly Eurosceptic tone adopted under Mr Hague, though both claim to be winning disaffected Labour voters in the north and Liberal Democrats in rural areas such as Devon and Cornwall. Nigel Farage, one of UKIP's founding members, now an MEP for the south-east region, confirmed that Mrs Gorman is one of those MPs with whom the party has been talking. But both he and Michael Holmes MEP, the UKIP leader, refused to divulge what had been discussed, though there were hints that the Billericay MP may have been exploring support for an independent run for London mayor. Malcolm Buckley, chairman of her local party, acknowledged the rumours about Mrs Gorman, reinforced by the fact that the UKIP decided not to stand against her in 1997, but said he had no reason to think they were true. Nor would she stand against whoever is the official Conservative candidate for London mayor. \"Since the government wants to get people interested in local government again the ideal contest would be between Teresa and Ken Livingstone. \"From a Conservative point of view we would much prefer to see Livingstone as the Labour candidate. He would be a much more attractive proposition for us to attack,\" Mr Buckley said. The UKIP has been riven with dissent since last October's annual conference when its entire national executive committee was urged to resign, but refused. The NEC is at loggerheads with Mr Holmes, and efforts will be made to patch up the feud on January 22. \"Like the Green party in 1989 [when it did well in the Euro-elections] we are experiencing growing pains,\" said Mr Farage. \"It has been a miserable couple of months.\"",

Walls warned Wilson: \"You are at risk, particularly in what may be a prelude to an election year\" of appearing to \"intervene to keep Her off the television so that you can hog it\".",

The company's information technology staff took until 11.30am to return things to normal. Railtrack phone inquiry lines were continuously engaged. A spokeswoman said they believed the site had been vulnerable \"because of a hitch in a piece of Microsoft software we have got\". The site - one of Britain's busiest - gets an average of 171,000 calls a day. Staff were expecting far heavier traffic than usual yesterday The message ended with \"greetings to all the sheep in Wales and all of the Railtrack directors\". It added greetings to \"HackUK, Rootworm, Illusions Team, Domz, Trionix, Slacker, Alkatraz, Dred\". None of these nicknames is familiar in hacking circles. A specialist said yesterday: \"They could be just blokes in a pub picking names out of a hat.\" Last night one surfer who saw the message, Richard Yarnall, a Birmingham electronics engineer, said: \"I was on a chat channel when somebody said, 'Have you heard all the trains have been cancelled?' I looked at the Railtrack website and spotted that something was not quite right with the message.\" The Railtrack spokeswoman said: \"This is a prank which is supposed to be amusing. \"Unfortunately, it affected hundreds and thousands of people who were trying to get into London for the millennium eve celebrations.\" Timetables could still be reached while the message was on screen, she added. \"I have not heard of our website being hacked before. We shall be trying very hard to see that it does not happen again. We would like to reassure customers that trains are running as published.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>Especially Delightful Is the First Day</strong> </p> <p>Especially delightful is the first day of the First Month, when the mists so often shroud the sky. Everyone pays great attention to his appearance and dresses with the utmost care. What a pleasure it is to see them all offer their congratulations to the Emperor and celebrate their own new year! </p> <p>This is the day when members of the nobility who live outside the Palace arrive in their magnificently decorated carriages to admire the blue horses. As the carriages are drawn over the ground-beam of the Central Gate, there is always a tremendous bump, and the heads of the women passengers are knocked together; the combs fall out of their hair, and may be smashed to pieces if the owners are not careful. I enjoy the way everyone laughs when this happens. </p> <p>I remember one occasion when I visited the Palace to see the procession of blue horses. Several senior courtiers were standing outside the guard-house of the Left Division; they had borrowed bows from the escorts, and, with much laughter, were twanging them to make the blue horses prance. Looking through one of the gates of the Palace enclosure, I could dimly make out a garden fence, near which a number of ladies, several of them from the Office of Grounds, went to and fro. What lucky women, I thought, who could walk about the Nine-Fold Enclosure as though they had lived there all their lives! Just then the escorts passed close to my carriage, remarkably close, in fact, considering the vastness of the Palace grounds, and I could actually see the texture of their faces. Some of them were not properly powdered; here and there their skin showed through unpleasantly like the dark patches of earth in a garden where the snow has begun to melt. When the horses in the procession reared wildly, I shrank into the back of my carriage and could no longer see what was happening. </p> <p>It is fascinating to see what happens during the period of appointments. However snowy and icy it may be, candidates of the Fourth and Fifth Ranks come to the Palace with their official requests. Those who are still young and merry seem full of confidence. For the candidates who are old and white-haired things do not go so smoothly. Such men have to apply for help from people with influence at Court; some of them even visit ladies-in-waiting in their quarters and go to great lengths in pointing out their own merits. If young women happen to be present, they are greatly amused. As soon as the candidates have left, they mimic and deride them, something that the old men cannot possibly suspect as they scurry from one part of the Palace to another, begging everyone, \"Please present my petition favourably to the Emperor\" and \"Pray inform Her Majesty about me.\" It is not so bad if they finally succeed, but it really is rather pathetic when all their efforts prove in vain. </p> <p><strong>Things That Have Lost Their Power</strong> </p> <p> A woman who has taken off her false locks to comb the short hair that remains. A large tree that has been blown down in a gale and lies on its side with its roots in the air. The retreating figure of a sumo wrestler who has been defeated in a match. A man of no importance reprimanding an attendant. </p> <p>A woman, who is angry with her husband about some trifling matter, leaves home and goes somewhere to hide. She is certain that he will rush about looking for her; but he does nothing of the kind and shows the most infuriating indifference. Since she cannot stay away forever, she swallows her pride and returns. </p> <p> <strong> Adorable Things</strong> </p> <p>The face of a child drawn on a melon. </p> <p>A baby of two or so is crawling, rapidly along the ground. With his sharp eyes he catches sight of a tiny object and, picking it up with his pretty little fingers, takes it to show to a grown-up person. </p> <p>A baby sparrow that comes hopping up when one imitates the squeak of a mouse; or again, when one has tied it with a thread round its leg and its parents bring insects or worms and pop them in its mouth: delightful! </p> <p>One picks up a pretty baby and holds him for a while in one's arms; while one is fondling him, he clings to one's neck and then falls asleep. </p> <p>Pretty, white chicks who are still not fully fledged and look as if their clothes are too short for them; cheeping loudly, they follow one on their long legs, or walk close to the mother hen. </p> <p> <strong> When I Make Myself Imagine</strong> </p> <p> When I make myself imagine what it is like to be one of those women who live at home, faithfully serving their husbands, women who have not a single exciting prospect in life yet who believe that they are perfectly happy, I am filled with scorn. Often they are of quite good birth, yet have had no opportunity to find out what the world is like. I wish they could live for a while in our society, even if it should mean taking service as Attendants, so that they might come to know the delights it has to offer. </p> <p>I cannot bear men who believe that women serving in the Palace are bound to be frivolous and wicked. Yet I suppose their prejudice is understandable. After all, women at Court do not spend their time hiding modestly behind fans and screens, but walk about, looking openly at people they chance to meet. Yes, they see everyone face to face, not only ladies-in-waiting like themselves, but even Their Imperial Majesties (whose august names I hardly dare mention), High Court Nobles, senior courtiers, and other gentlemen of high rank. In the presence of such exalted personages, the women in the Palace are all equally brazen, whether they be the maids of ladies-in-waiting, or the relations of Court ladies who have come to visit them, or housekeepers, or latrine-cleaners, or women who are of no more value than a roof-tile or a pebble. Small wonder that the young men regard them as immodest! Yet are the gentlemen themselves any less so? They are not exactly bashful when it comes to looking at the great people in the Palace. No, everyone at Court is much the same in this respect. </p> <p>Women who have served in the Palace, but who later get married and live at home, are called Madam and receive the most respectful treatment. To be sure, people often consider that these women, who have displayed their faces to all and sundry during their years at Court, are lacking in feminine grace. How proud they must be, nevertheless, when they are styled Assistant Attendants, or summoned to the Palace for occasional duty, or ordered to serve as Imperial envoys during the Kamo Festival! Even those who stay at home lose nothing by having served at Court. In fact they make very good wives. For example, if they are married to a provincial governor and their daughter is chosen to take part in the Gosechi dances, they do not have to disgrace themselves by acting like provincials and asking other people about procedure. They themselves are well versed in the formalities, which is just as it should be. </p> <p> <strong> Depressing Things</strong> </p> <p> A dog howling in the daytime. A lying-in room when the baby has died. A cold, empty brazier. An ox-driver who hates his oxen. </p> <p>A letter arrives from the provinces, but no gift accompanies it. It would be bad enough if such a letter reached one in the provinces from someone in the capital; but then at least it would have interesting news about goings-on in society, and that would be a consolation. </p> <p>One has written a letter, taking pains to make it as attractive as possible, and now one impatiently awaits the reply. \"Surely the messenger should be back by now,\" one thinks. Just then he returns; but in his hand he carries, not a reply, but one's own letter, still twisted or knotted as it was sent, but now so dirty and crumpled that even the ink-mark on the outside has disappeared. \"Not at home,\" announces the messenger, or else, \"They said they were observing a day of abstinence and would not accept it.\" Oh, how depressing! </p> <p>Again, one has sent one's carriage to fetch someone who had said he would definitely pay one a visit on that day. Finally it returns with a great clatter, and the servants hurry out with cries of \"Here they come!\" But next one hears the carriage being pulled into the coach-house, and the unfastened shafts clatter to the ground. \"What does this mean?\" one asks. \"The person was not at home,\" replies the driver, \"and will not be coming.\" So saying, he leads the ox back to its stall, leaving the carriage in the coach-house. </p> <p>With much bustle and excitement a young man has moved into the house of a certain family as the daughter's husband. One day he fails to come home, and it turns out that some high-ranking Court lady has taken him as her lover. How depressing! \"Will he eventually tire of the woman and come back to us?\" his wife's family wonders ruefully. </p> <p>The nurse who is looking after a baby leaves the house, saying that she will be back presently. Soon the child starts crying for her. One tries to comfort it by games and other diversions, and even sends a message to the nurse telling her to return immediately. Then comes her reply: \"I am afraid that I cannot be back this evening.\" This is not only depressing; it is no less than hateful. Yet how much more distressed must be the young man who has sent a messenger to fetch a lady friend and who awaits her arrival in vain! </p> <p>It is quite late at night and a woman has been expecting a visitor. Hearing finally a stealthy tapping, she sends her maid to open the gate and lies waiting excitedly. But the name announced by the maid is that of someone with whom she has absolutely no connection. Of all the depressing things this is by far the worst. </p> <p>One has sent a friend a verse that turned out fairly well. How depressing when there is no reply-poem! Even in the case of love poems, people should at least answer that they were moved at receiving the message, or something of the sort; otherwise they will cause the keenest disappointment. </p> <p>Someone who lives in a bustling, fashionable household receives a message from an elderly person who is behind the times and has very little to do; the poem, of course, is old-fashioned and dull. How depressing! </p> <p>One needs a particularly beautiful fan for some special occasion and instructs an artist, in whose talents one has full confidence, to decorate one with an appropriate painting. When the day comes and the fan is delivered, one is shocked to see how badly it has been painted. Oh, the dreariness of it! </p> <p>A man has moved in as a son-in-law; yet even now, after some five years of marriage, the lying-in room has remained as quiet as on the day of his arrival. </p> <p>An elderly couple who have several grown-up children, and who may even have some grand- children crawling about the house, are taking a nap in the daytime. The children who see them in this state are overcome by a forlorn feeling, and for other people it is all very depressing. </p> <p>Persistent rain on the last day of the year. </p> <p>One has been observing a period of fast, but neglects it for just one day: most depressing. </p> <p> <strong> Hateful Things</strong> </p> <p> One is in a hurry to leave, but one's visitor keeps chattering away. If it is someone of no importance, one can get rid of him by saying, \"You must tell me all about it next time\"; but, should it be the sort of visitor whose presence commands one's best behaviour, the situation is hateful indeed. </p> <p>A man who has nothing in particular to recommend him discusses all sorts of subjects at random as though he knew everything. </p> <p>A man with whom one is having an affair keeps singing the praises of some woman he used to know. Even if it is a thing of the past this can be very annoying. How much more so if he is still seeing the woman! (Yet sometimes I find that it is not as unpleasant as all that.) </p> <p>The sound of dogs when they bark for a long time in chorus is ominous and hateful. </p> <p>A lover who is leaving at dawn announces that he has to find his fan and his paper. \"I know I put them somewhere last night,\" he says. Since it is pitch dark, he gropes about the room, bumping into the furniture and muttering, \"Strange! Where on earth can they be?\" Finally he discovers the objects. He thrusts the paper into the breast of his robe with a great rustling sound; then he snaps open his fan and busily fans away with it. Only now is he ready to take his leave. What charmless behaviour! Hateful is an understatement. </p> <p>Equally disagreeable is the man who, when leaving in the middle of the night, takes care to fasten the cord of his head-dress. This is quite unnecessary; he could perfectly well put it gently on his head without tying the cord. And why must he spend time adjusting his cloak or hunting costume? Does he really think someone may see him at this time of night and criticise him for not being impeccably dressed? </p> <p>A good lover will behave as elegantly at dawn as at any other time. He drags himself out of bed with a look of dismay on his face. The lady urges him on: \"Come, my friend, it's getting light. You don't want anyone to find you here.\" He gives a deep sigh, as if to say that the night has not been nearly long enough and that it is agony to leave. Once up, he does not instantly pull on his trousers. Instead he comes close to the lady and whispers whatever was left unsaid during the night. Even when he is dressed, he still lingers, vaguely pretending to be fastening his sash. </p> <p>Presently he raises the lattice, and the two lovers stand together by the side door while he tells her how he dreads the coming day, which will keep them apart; then he slips away. The lady watches him go, and this moment of parting will remain among her most charming memories. </p> <p>Indeed, one's attachment to a man depends largely on the elegance of his leave-taking. </p> <p> <strong> Things That Make One's Heart Beat Faster</strong> </p> <p> Sparrows feeding their young. To pass a place where babies are playing. To sleep in a room where some fine incense has been burnt. To notice that one's elegant Chinese mirror has become a little cloudy. </p> <p>To see a gentleman stop his carriage before one's gate and instruct his attendants to announce his arrival. To wash one's hair, make one's toilet, and put on scented robes; even if not a soul sees one, these preparations still produce an inner pleasure. </p> <p> It is night and one is expecting a visitor. Suddenly one is startled by the sound of raindrops, which the wind blows against the shutters. </p> <p> <strong> Things That Arouse a Fond Memory of the Past</strong> </p> <p> Dried hollyhock. To find a piece of deep violet or grape-coloured material that has been pressed between the pages of a notebook. </p> <p>It is a rainy day and one is feeling bored. To pass the time, one starts looking through some old papers. And then one comes across the letters of a man one used to love. </p> <p>Last year's paper fan. A night with a clear moon. </p> <p> <strong> Splendid Things</strong> </p> <p> Chinese brocade. A sword with a decorated scabbard. The grain of the wood in a Buddhist statue. Long flowering branches of beautifully coloured wisteria entwined about a pine tree. </p> <p>Despite his low station, a Chamberlain of the Sixth Rank is a splendid thing. To think that he is allowed yellowish-green robes of figured material and cloth that even young noblemen of the finest families are forbidden to wear! A mere Assistant or Subordinate Official in the Emperor's Private Office, who is the son of a commoner and who has gone completely unnoticed while serving under gentlemen of rank with official posts, becomes splendid beyond words after being appointed Chamberlain. </p> <p> <strong> Awkward Things</strong> </p> <p> One has gone to a house and asked to see someone; but the wrong person appears, thinking that it is he who is wanted; this is especially awkward if one has brought a present. </p> <p>One has allowed oneself to speak badly about someone without really intending to do so; a young child who has overheard it all goes and repeats what one has said in front of the person in question. </p> <p>Someone sobs out a pathetic story. One is deeply moved; but it so happens that not a single tear comes to one's eyes, most awkward. Though one makes one's face look as if one's going to cry, it is no use: not a single tear will come. Yet there are times when, having heard something happy, one feels the tears streaming out. </p> <p> <strong> Things That Give a Clean Feeling</strong> </p> <p> An earthen cup. A new metal bowl. A rush mat. The play of the light on water as one pours it into a vessel. A new wooden chest. </p> <p> <strong> Things That Give an Unclean Feeling</strong> </p> <p> A rat's nest. Someone who is late in washing his hands in the morning. White snivel, and children who sniffle as they walk. The containers used for oil. Little sparrows. </p> <p>A person who does not bathe for a long time even though the weather is hot. All faded clothes give me an unclean feeling, especially those that have glossy colours.</p>",

It would be bad enough if such a letter reached one in the provinces from someone in the capital; but then at least it would have interesting news about goings-on in society, and that would be a consolation. One has written a letter, taking pains to make it as attractive as possible, and now one impatiently awaits the reply. \"Surely the messenger should be back by now,\" one thinks. Just then he returns; but in his hand he carries, not a reply, but one's own letter, still twisted or knotted as it was sent, but now so dirty and crumpled that even the ink-mark on the outside has disappeared. \"Not at home,\" announces the messenger, or else, \"They said they were observing a day of abstinence and would not accept it.\" Oh, how depressing! Again, one has sent one's carriage to fetch someone who had said he would definitely pay one a visit on that day. Finally it returns with a great clatter, and the servants hurry out with cries of \"Here they come!\" But next one hears the carriage being pulled into the coach-house, and the unfastened shafts clatter to the ground. \"What does this mean?\" one asks. \"The person was not at home,\" replies the driver, \"and will not be coming.\" So saying, he leads the ox back to its stall, leaving the carriage in the coach-house. With much bustle and excitement a young man has moved into the house of a certain family as the daughter's husband. One day he fails to come home, and it turns out that some high-ranking Court lady has taken him as her lover. How depressing! \"Will he eventually tire of the woman and come back to us?\" his wife's family wonders ruefully. The nurse who is looking after a baby leaves the house, saying that she will be back presently. Soon the child starts crying for her. One tries to comfort it by games and other diversions, and even sends a message to the nurse telling her to return immediately. Then comes her reply: \"I am afraid that I cannot be back this evening.\" This is not only depressing; it is no less than hateful. Yet how much more distressed must be the young man who has sent a messenger to fetch a lady friend and who awaits her arrival in vain! It is quite late at night and a woman has been expecting a visitor. Hearing finally a stealthy tapping, she sends her maid to open the gate and lies waiting excitedly. But the name announced by the maid is that of someone with whom she has absolutely no connection. Of all the depressing things this is by far the worst. One has sent a friend a verse that turned out fairly well. How depressing when there is no reply-poem! Even in the case of love poems, people should at least answer that they were moved at receiving the message, or something of the sort; otherwise they will cause the keenest disappointment. Someone who lives in a bustling, fashionable household receives a message from an elderly person who is behind the times and has very little to do; the poem, of course, is old-fashioned and dull. How depressing! One needs a particularly beautiful fan for some special occasion and instructs an artist, in whose talents one has full confidence, to decorate one with an appropriate painting. When the day comes and the fan is delivered, one is shocked to see how badly it has been painted. Oh, the dreariness of it! A man has moved in as a son-in-law; yet even now, after some five years of marriage, the lying-in room has remained as quiet as on the day of his arrival. An elderly couple who have several grown-up children, and who may even have some grand- children crawling about the house, are taking a nap in the daytime. The children who see them in this state are overcome by a forlorn feeling, and for other people it is all very depressing. Persistent rain on the last day of the year. One has been observing a period of fast, but neglects it for just one day: most depressing. Hateful Things One is in a hurry to leave, but one's visitor keeps chattering away. If it is someone of no importance, one can get rid of him by saying, \"You must tell me all about it next time\"; but, should it be the sort of visitor whose presence commands one's best behaviour, the situation is hateful indeed. A man who has nothing in particular to recommend him discusses all sorts of subjects at random as though he knew everything. A man with whom one is having an affair keeps singing the praises of some woman he used to know. Even if it is a thing of the past this can be very annoying. How much more so if he is still seeing the woman! (Yet sometimes I find that it is not as unpleasant as all that.) The sound of dogs when they bark for a long time in chorus is ominous and hateful. A lover who is leaving at dawn announces that he has to find his fan and his paper. \"I know I put them somewhere last night,\" he says. Since it is pitch dark, he gropes about the room, bumping into the furniture and muttering, \"Strange! Where on earth can they be?\" Finally he discovers the objects. He thrusts the paper into the breast of his robe with a great rustling sound; then he snaps open his fan and busily fans away with it. Only now is he ready to take his leave. What charmless behaviour! Hateful is an understatement. Equally disagreeable is the man who, when leaving in the middle of the night, takes care to fasten the cord of his head-dress. This is quite unnecessary; he could perfectly well put it gently on his head without tying the cord. And why must he spend time adjusting his cloak or hunting costume? Does he really think someone may see him at this time of night and criticise him for not being impeccably dressed? A good lover will behave as elegantly at dawn as at any other time. He drags himself out of bed with a look of dismay on his face. The lady urges him on: \"Come, my friend, it's getting light. You don't want anyone to find you here.\" He gives a deep sigh, as if to say that the night has not been nearly long enough and that it is agony to leave. Once up, he does not instantly pull on his trousers. Instead he comes close to the lady and whispers whatever was left unsaid during the night. Even when he is dressed, he still lingers, vaguely pretending to be fastening his sash. Presently he raises the lattice, and the two lovers stand together by the side door while he tells her how he dreads the coming day, which will keep them apart; then he slips away. The lady watches him go, and this moment of parting will remain among her most charming memories. Indeed, one's attachment to a man depends largely on the elegance of his leave-taking. Things That Make One's Heart Beat Faster Sparrows feeding their young. To pass a place where babies are playing. To sleep in a room where some fine incense has been burnt. To notice that one's elegant Chinese mirror has become a little cloudy. To see a gentleman stop his carriage before one's gate and instruct his attendants to announce his arrival. To wash one's hair, make one's toilet, and put on scented robes; even if not a soul sees one, these preparations still produce an inner pleasure. It is night and one is expecting a visitor. Suddenly one is startled by the sound of raindrops, which the wind blows against the shutters. Things That Arouse a Fond Memory of the Past Dried hollyhock. To find a piece of deep violet or grape-coloured material that has been pressed between the pages of a notebook. It is a rainy day and one is feeling bored. To pass the time, one starts looking through some old papers. And then one comes across the letters of a man one used to love. Last year's paper fan. A night with a clear moon. Splendid Things Chinese brocade. A sword with a decorated scabbard. The grain of the wood in a Buddhist statue. Long flowering branches of beautifully coloured wisteria entwined about a pine tree. Despite his low station, a Chamberlain of the Sixth Rank is a splendid thing. To think that he is allowed yellowish-green robes of figured material and cloth that even young noblemen of the finest families are forbidden to wear! A mere Assistant or Subordinate Official in the Emperor's Private Office, who is the son of a commoner and who has gone completely unnoticed while serving under gentlemen of rank with official posts, becomes splendid beyond words after being appointed Chamberlain. Awkward Things One has gone to a house and asked to see someone; but the wrong person appears, thinking that it is he who is wanted; this is especially awkward if one has brought a present. One has allowed oneself to speak badly about someone without really intending to do so; a young child who has overheard it all goes and repeats what one has said in front of the person in question. Someone sobs out a pathetic story. One is deeply moved; but it so happens that not a single tear comes to one's eyes, most awkward. Though one makes one's face look as if one's going to cry, it is no use: not a single tear will come. Yet there are times when, having heard something happy, one feels the tears streaming out. Things That Give a Clean Feeling An earthen cup. A new metal bowl. A rush mat. The play of the light on water as one pours it into a vessel. A new wooden chest. Things That Give an Unclean Feeling A rat's nest. Someone who is late in washing his hands in the morning. White snivel, and children who sniffle as they walk. The containers used for oil. Little sparrows. A person who does not bathe for a long time even though the weather is hot. All faded clothes give me an unclean feeling, especially those that have glossy colours.",

Apparently the number of earthquakes rose very quickly during the last century. Between 1890 and 1970, there was an average of two to six earthquakes per year. Between 1980 and 1990, there were on average 86 each year. Between 1990 and 1998 there have been more than a hundred each year.

In 1979 he lost his voice and was taken to hospital near his home in New Hampshire. As he lay in his bed, he experienced several visions. It was, he said, like having 10 TVs in the room, all of them filled with terrible things. A little like SkyDigital, then, but with fewer channels. There were tornadoes, erupting volcanoes, a Happy Days-themed evening on Channel 12. If only he had had a decent remote control as he lay there he could have put on something more soothing. But in 1979, as I'm sure you recall, remote controls came with coiled leads and weighed as much as a Lada estate, making channel-changing an activity that demanded considerable strength and commitment. Instead, Scallion wrote down what he remembered of these and subsequent visions. Why do prophets make such dull predictions (he asked rhetorically)? Scallion, for instance, predicted that George Bush would be elected president and that there would be an earthquake in California in 1994. </p> <p>Scallion's visions have since become more troubling. By 2012, he claims, the tides will have risen around the world in a frankly unappealing manner: in that year Japan will be reduced to a tiny island, Britain will be no more, the Mississippi will burst its banks so comprehensively that there will be two USAs, one on the left and the other, you will not be surprised to learn, on the right. All very interesting. But can Scallion prophesy the important things, such as whether Stan Collymore will prosper at Montpellier before the world ends? I suspect not. </p> <p>Dr Michael Shermer appeared and talked about his book Why People Believe Weird Things (not, one suspects, the title of his doctoral thesis). He should really write another book too. Why TV Stations Give Airtime to Jokers Like These Without a Hint of a Critical Perspective.

How on earth would you get home from work with a timetable that flexible? Eh? Or maybe the end will come like the 91 to Hornsey Rise.

Harbison, though, will rarely have finer advocates than the Met was able to assemble for this world-premiere run. A gallery of America's very finest singers give marvellously committed performances. As the driven Gatsby, Jerry Hadley occasionally struggles with the exposed tenor line, but his diction and sense of style are exemplary. Dawn Upshaw is likewise in her element as Daisy, touchingly communicative and charac terful. Dwayne Croft sings Nick with rare authority. He goes from strength to strength, as does Susan Graham, whose luscious mezzo and warm personality make the enigmatic Jordan Baker come truly alive. Mark Baker sings Tom Buchanan with an attractive ardour, though surely somewhat at odds with the character. And the irresistible Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, surely one of the great singers of our era, makes a vocally ravishing Met debut as the doomed Myrtle Wilson. Levine conducts with a commitment that is sometimes lacking in his work, and the orchestra give their all in a rhythmically demanding score. The production by Mark Lamos, with restrained designs by Michael Yeargan, seems somewhat lost in the Met's huge stage spaces.",

      "body": "<p>I'm screwed if I do, buggered if I don't. I don't see how I can emerge from writing this without being in trouble. If I write it, I'm almost certain to be labelled a BBC suckbutt, and I'm almost certain to make enough factual errors to be a broadcasting outcast. But on the other hand, I can't resist it, because I think if by any horrible chance people and the law do start really to chip away at the bit of the BBC I know, we're all buggered. </p> <p>Here's the thing - the BBC's record in acted comedy has been, and still is, miraculous. I've tried to compile a list of genuinely popular acted comedy programmes that I can remember over the last 40 years (without consulting books). When you read it, the BBC list looks pretty good. Time and time again, from Steptoe through to Yes Minister, from the Young Ones to Bottom, from Fawlty Towers to Absolutely Fabulous, from Monty Python to Only Fools and Horses, the history of British TV comedy really is very nearly the history of comedy on the BBC. </p> <p>I went into comedy in the first place because of the joy I got from Monty Python as a schoolboy. A third of our laughter at school was just quoting Python, and I believe all over the country people quote the Fast Show, or Harry Enfield's characters. If one of Britain's great characteristics is its comedy, then the BBC deserves enormous credit for indulging it and supplying it. </p> <p>Just look at the list - it's freakish how the BBC have continued, no matter how much the media environment changes, to come out with a huge proportion of the funny things on television. Reviewers are getting increasingly mad, claiming that one bad first episode of a new series means the BBC is totally down the drain. But through all the criticism the BBC have still produced or commissioned Absolutely Fabulous, One Foot in the Grave, Only Fools, the totally remarkable I'm Alan Partridge and the revolutionary and brilliant Royle Family. Against these, in terms of quality, there's only Father Ted and Drop the Dead Donkey - and the writers of Father Ted started with the BBC, and did the experimental, wonderful Big Train for the BBC, and have just done Hippies for the BBC. </p> <p>In the world of sketches, Channel 4 has recently been doing some great work - Smack the Pony, Miller and Armstrong, Brass Eye, The Mark Thomas Comedy Product, the 11 O'Clock Show - but they have to stack up against The Day Today, Goodness Gracious Me, the Fast Show, Big Train, French and Saunders, Harry Enfield and Chums - all at the BBC. </p> <p>The problem with the \"BBC-surprisingly-damn-good-at-comedy-year-after-year\" thing is that no one knows how it happens, or why it happens. </p> <p>One reason is the radio. There are waves of stuff flowing from Radio 4 comedy, where The Hitchhiker's Guide, Goodness Gracious Me and People Like Us started, as did the people of Not the Nine O'Clock News and The Day Today. People learn their craft and then move to TV at the right time. God pray that link is never severed. </p> <p>And then there's something about the very casualness of the BBC. After The Young Ones, Ben Elton wrote Filthy Rich and Catflap and Happy Families, which actually were rather weird and wonderful - but not very successful. But this didn't throw the BBC off its course. Elton went on to do Blackadder and Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson went on to do Bottom. Blackadder One was awful, and yet they let us do Blackadder Two, which was better, except the terrible episode with the false breasts. Even Only Fools wasn't very successful till about series three. Men Behaving Badly wasn't very successful on ITV, but the BBC spotted its potential. The Mrs Merton Show was a deeply odd little pilot, cleverly picked up by the BBC. The BBC may be a lot of things - but still, even now, the BBC isn't scaredy cat. </p> <p>Then there's the unique relationship between BBC2 and BBC1, which tragically doesn't exist between Channel 4 and ITV. BBC2 experiments - then BBC1 reaps the benefit: the Royle Family jumped stations. Vic and Bob have moved, French and Saunders moved, David Renwick and Andrew Marshall did Not the Nine O'Clock News on BBC2 and then moved on, separately, to One Foot and 2.4 Children on BBC1. </p> <p>And, finally, my experience in the BBC is that, once they commission you, they're not very interfering. </p> <p>That's a few vague guesses - I can't get to the bottom of it - but the end result is one of the great things about Britain's popular culture. I've never understood people who claim that American sitcom is much better than ours. When Americans are good, they make a lot more episodes - but America produces about the same number of classic sitcoms as we do here in Britain. In the 60s, they had I Love Lucy and Dick Van Dyke, while we had Till Death Us Do Part and Hancock and Steptoe and Son. In the 70s, they had Soap and Mary Tyler Moore, while we had Yes Minister and Fawlty Towers and Dad's Army. In the 80s, they had Cheers and Taxi while we had Only Fools and Horses and The Young Ones. In the 90s, they've got Friends, Larry Sanders, Seinfield and Frasier - but we've had Father Ted, Absolutely Fabulous, Men Behaving Badly, the Royle Family, One Foot in the Grave. </p> <p>So it's very nearly the truth, then, that one little department in our organisation - allied with and giving a platform to a cluster of brilliant independents - is producing the same amount of extraordinary work as the entire massive multi-network, huge and highly paid American system. </p> <p>It's fun to attack the BBC - but as Joni Mitchell said, beware, \"You don't know what you've got till it's gone.\" In acted comedy, the sheer figures show it's the job of everyone else in TV to show that they could do anything like the job the BBC does before they damage the ability of BBC TV and radio to produce comedy. </p> <p>I hope that when the licence fee is discussed, and argued about, this is taken into consideration. Comedy can be expensive and the licence fee helps ensure that the BBC can experiment. It's a clich\u00e9 that comedy is ignored. Actors never get Oscars for it, and there are 10 times more books about Shakespeare's tragedies than his comedies. But comedy is a serious chunk of what's best in British literature, British life and, till now, British telly - and it's a chunk of TV that just might die if we're not all careful. It would be grisly if we'd just lived through the funny century - and were casually moving towards one where we laugh less, because people thought the comedy miracle of the BBC was just an unimportant sideshow, just a joke. </p> <p><strong>Those classic comedies</strong></p> <p><strong> BBC</strong> </p> <p><br>Hancock's Half Hour </p> <p>Steptoe and Son </p> <p>Monty Python's Flying Circus </p> <p>Till Death Us Do Part </p> <p>Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em </p> <p>That Was the Week that Was </p> <p>Not the Nine O'Clock News </p> <p>The Liver Birds </p> <p>The Likely Lads </p> <p>Morecambe and Wise </p> <p>To the Manor Born </p> <p>Fawlty Towers </p> <p>The Two Ronnies </p> <p>Porridge </p> <p>Open all Hours </p> <p>Only Fools and Horses </p> <p>Just Good Friends </p> <p>Dear John </p> <p>The Good Life </p> <p>The Day Today </p> <p>I'm Alan Partridge </p> <p>The League of Gentlemen </p> <p>Dinner Ladies </p> <p>Terry and June </p> <p>Three of a Kind </p> <p>French and Saunders </p> <p>Absolutely Fabulous </p> <p>Murder Most Horrid </p> <p>Let Them Eat Cake </p> <p>The Vicar of Dibley </p> <p>Yes Minister </p> <p>The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin </p> <p>The Mary Whitehouse Experience </p> <p>Blackadder </p> <p>People Like Us </p> <p>The Royle Family </p> <p>Hi de Hi </p> <p>It Ain't Half Hot Mum </p> <p>Mrs Merton </p> <p>Waiting for God </p> <p>The Fast Show </p> <p>The Thin Blue Line </p> <p>As Time Goes By </p> <p>Bread </p> <p>Butterflies </p> <p>Game On </p> <p>2.4 Children </p> <p>Men Behaving Badly </p> <p>Reeves and Mortimer </p> <p>Birds of a Father </p> <p>Goodness Gracious Me </p> <p>The Young Ones </p> <p>Hippies </p> <p>Dad's Army </p> <p><strong> ITV </strong></p> <p>The Army Game </p> <p>Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width </p> <p>Dustbin Men </p> <p>Rising Damp </p> <p>Agony </p> <p>Watching </p> <p>Rik Mayall Presents </p> <p>Cold Feet </p> <p>Morecambe and Wise </p> <p>Spitting Image </p> <p>Mr Bean </p> <p>Man About the House </p> <p>Hale and Pace </p> <p>Benny Hill </p> <p>The New Statesman </p> <p>Hot Metal </p> <p>Is it Legal? </p> <p>Whoops Apocalypse </p> <p>Doctor in the House </p> <p> <strong> Channel 4</strong></p> <p>Father Ted </p> <p>Drop the Dead Donkey </p> <p>Absolutely </p> <p>Armstrong and Miller </p> <p>Spaced </p> <p>Smack the Pony </p> <p>Vic and Bob's Big Night </p> <p>The 11 O'Clock Show </p> <p>Brass Eye </p> <p>Desmonds </p> <p>The Comic Strip </p> <p>The Rory Bremner Show</p>",

I hope that when the licence fee is discussed, and argued about, this is taken into consideration. Comedy can be expensive and the licence fee helps ensure that the BBC can experiment. It's a clich\u00e9 that comedy is ignored. Actors never get Oscars for it, and there are 10 times more books about Shakespeare's tragedies than his comedies. But comedy is a serious chunk of what's best in British literature, British life and, till now, British telly - and it's a chunk of TV that just might die if we're not all careful. It would be grisly if we'd just lived through the funny century - and were casually moving towards one where we laugh less, because people thought the comedy miracle of the BBC was just an unimportant sideshow, just a joke.

      "body": "<p>The reality of Port Canaveral was dull Florida scrubland with distant palm trees. Paul Pressler, president of Walt Disney Attractions, told us it was an \"absolutely beautiful and spectacular setting\", but I couldn't see it myself. But then there was that terminal. </p> <p>I still rage about Southampton's Ocean Terminal. Opened by Clement Attlee in 1950, it was razed by my home town's philistines 17 years ago. But with the Disney Company, nothing need be final: when you wish upon a star, doesn't matter who you are, resurrection is always a possibility. </p> <p>I never got inside the real Ocean Terminal, but that day last October, I got inside Disney's re-creation. The shape of Southampton's sole essay into 30s modern had been sampled, clad in glass, filled with light. I could not rid myself of the suspicion that Disney had first read my mind, then willed the terminal into existence. </p> <p>Late that afternoon, there was a reception. A septet, togged up in 18th-century powder-blue outfits and white wigs, worked through a repertoire somewhere between Michael Nyman and pop-go-the-classics. I met an amiable Mid-Western professorish man who turned out to be Goofy. Well, he was the man who voices Goofy. He did Pluto, too, he observed, and barked. </p> <p>It was a reception before the \"christening\" of Disney Wonder, the Disney Cruise Line's second 83,000-ton cruise ship and destined to ply its trade between Canaveral and the Bahamas. Tinkerbell from Peter Pan was doing the job, one of the many big British stars - Pooh, Poppins, Hood - who years ago switched empires and accents, and quit the British childhood franchise for big money Disneyside. </p> <p>Since Tinkerbell was never much of a talker, Mickey Mouse MCed for her. In the dusk, the fairy's light flew around the hull while fireworks erupted, cascaded and crackled. The sound of When You Wish Upon A Star, the Internationale of the Walt Disney Company, floated across the water and into the billowing smoke around the ship. \"A dream is a wish your heart makes,\" was sung, I think by the Little Mermaid, \"when you are fast asleep.\" </p> <p>But a dream is a wish the Disney Company makes when their executives, planners, \"imagineers\" and accountants are wide awake. And they are always wide awake. The terminal was no more than a minutely-researched allusion, a historical quotation to illustrate the backcloth for Disney Wonder and its sister Disney Magic. The cruise ships are themselves pastiche 30s transatlantic liners, mock twin red funnels and all, destined to sail a few hundred miles out from Florida, an optional extra for visitors based 90 miles away at the \"Walt Disney World Resort\" at Lake Buena Vista. </p> <p>And the World is where I went. It is the core of the Disney universe, 47 square miles - twice the size of Manhattan - with four theme parks, three water adventure parks, 27 hotels, six golf courses, the Downtown Disney entertainment park, a sports complex and a place where you can get married. In 1998, 1.6 million British tourists went there. We love Disney World. </p> <p>Mouse hit the phone on my first morning. I had booked an alarm call. \"Up and at 'em pal!\" squawked the voice down the line. \"Big doin's going on! So let's get started!\" </p> <p>I slammed down the receiver. In the bathroom, I contemplated the soap. It was boxed. On the box was Mouse, black and white, up and at 'em, in red and yellow shorts. Staring eyes, grinning, he was juggling soap, making bubbles. On the back of the box was a quote from the Mickey Mouse Club dated to 1955. \"Everybody neat and pretty?\" it asked. \"Then on with the show!\" Stay neat and pretty, I reckon, and you can do anything. </p> <p>In the Africa section of Disney's Animal Kingdom, the staff were dressed in Gap meets Where No Vultures Fly imperial costume. Pausing in the East African coastal town of \"Harambe\", I slipped into the gents and momentarily anticipated the pungent, challenging bouquet of third-world urinals. Foolishness indeed; beyond the baked-mud synthetic exterior, through the ancient door was The Rest Room From Middle America Mall. </p> <p>The nearby Kilimanjaro Safari, complete with zebras, rhinos, giraffes et al , was dramatised around the threat of elephant poachers; over in the Asia section's Kali River Rapids, pesky loggers were the problem. Nature must not be left to its own devices, because nature recognises no control - as Hurricane Floyd had just demonstrated by wrecking Disney's Bahamian holiday island. A world mediated through Disney is one that provides clean lavatories, artificially-inseminated drama, beginnings, middles and ends. Thus are vanishing species, within that theme park logic, a good thing. Hurry there now while stocks of white rhinos last! </p> <p>At the end of the safari ride, we discovered the poachers' Land Rover (again authentic product placement, just like the magnificently-decorated Bedford lorry in the Asia section) guarded by a \"Kenyan\" who looked, I thought, curiously like a real Colombian guerrilla from south of the border. Reality, or at least alternative fantasies, can intrude. Observing a bored lion, I conjured up my own East African characters to divert him: a group of beastly white-mischiefmakers perhaps, surprised en flagrante, with gin bottles, Illustrated London Newses and a carelessly-concealed Webley Service Revolver. </p> <p>Then there was Animal Kingdom's unfortunately titled Countdown to Extinction. But there were no white rhinos. Instead, we were to count out dinosaurs, experienced \"thanks to a generous grant from the McDonald's Corporation\" - outside funding is the Disney secret. \"It's fast. It's a blast. It's in the past.\" And thus did a 1930s Amazing Science Fiction-style \"time transport loading bay\" introduce a rogue scientist and a tunnel full of tyrannosauri. </p> <p>In the middle of Hollywood, I stood outside Grauman's Chinese Theater. It looked just like it did in old black-and-white Oscar-night newsreels only in colour, if you take my meaning, when they had real stars. Across the sunlit boulevard was the Brown Derby restaurant where people like Gary Cooper and Joan Crawford probably ate steak in that other place, time and dimension before the eaterie retuned its menu to counter multiple cholesterol scares. </p> <p>It was a sunny lunchtime and On the Street Where You Live was playing through the PA - well it wasn't playing, the sidewalk seemed to exude it. Grauman's promised \"a spectacular ride into the movies\". </p> <p>In street-scene Hollywood, all was tranquillity with tourists grazing on ice cream. Inside Grauman's, with its animated wax and flesh, all hell let loose. There were bootleggers blazing away at each other - the plot line had a hood joining the ride - followed by cowboys blazing away at each other. I wrote \"the key to America is the gun\" in my notebook. Then Bergman and Bogart showed up, followed by Garland and the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man and Sigourney Weaver and the Alien. A great movie-clip sequence climaxed the trip, and I came out thinking about my note and looking round at the grazers and pondering cowardly lions, tin men and a Hollywood half a continent away in Los Angeles which succumbed to deprivation, discrimination and urban violence. Who needed real LA? </p> <p>Inside the gates of Disney Florida, Hollywood deprivation, discrimination and bad housing are excluded, and the public enemies, good guys and plain misunderstood, all shoot blanks. At those gates, people gather as they do at shrines to the Virgin Mary in other lands. But in those places, the Virgin never does personal appearances, and no miracles are performed. In Disney World, not only are there miracles, but at Disney-MGM they show how they do them at Backlot Tours. </p> <p>It is, as the Muppets put it at the Muppetvision show, \"a salute to all nations - but mostly America\", a place where, amid the money and the package tours, the poor and the desperately ill take a day out of their lives, while the amazingly plump are trolleyed through the gates. What the whole world needs, I speculated, is theme park treatment, and gates. </p> <p>Magic Kingdom was the original Disney World theme park, and it opened in 1971. Disney-MGM opened in 1989, and Animal Kingdom less than two years ago. And then there is Epcot - the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow - a late dream from Walt Disney, the man, which opened in 1978, 12 years after his death. </p> <p>The late British cartoonist David Low is quoted in the company bio of Walt describing the creator of Mouse as \"the most significant figure in graphic arts since Leonardo\". But Da Vinci only had a workshop, Walt had a corporation. </p> <p>On a landing between the third and fourth deck of Disney Wonder, there is a big 1932 photograph of Walter Elias Disney (1901-1966). He is in black-and-white co-respondent shoes, dark hair macassared back, a David Niven moustache, white shirt with a huge collar, white tennis flannels. He stares into the camera, eyes wide open, quizzical, perfectly in control, the great cultural dictator. </p> <p>In another Disney Wonder photograph of Walt, taken with his wife two years later on some liner deck, he swings Mouse by the leg. Mouse, upside down, seems to glower, no respect. The Mouse was, still is, after all, the front-man, but then Disney was the genius, the man who told the people what they wanted and then gave it to them. A Bill Gates with an artistic vision. </p> <p>Disney gave the people Snow White and Toscanini. Nowadays, they get the Animator's Palate on Disney Wonder, a restaurant whose black-and-white sketch decor shades into colour as the meal progresses - it should have won the Turner Prize - and Philip Glass, live at Epcot's Innoventions Plaza. </p> <p>It was the night before they launched the point of it all, the \"Walt Disney World Millennium Celebration\", the event that obviated the need for your celebrations last night. With Mouse's gloved hand waving from behind the vast Spaceship Earth globe, and lasers, and blue, red, yellow waterfalls all around, Glass's minimalism surged over the Plaza. </p> <p>A New Yorker sprung to her feet. \"At last!\" she cried, \"mass America meets the avant-garde!\" I looked around; mass America was sadly minimal. There were maybe 50 of the vast, invited crowd nearby. The maximalists had fanned out around World Showcase and Test Track and the Living Seas and hot sushi and guacamole and jumbo strawberries. \"Okay,\" she said. \"But it's a start.\"</p> <p>And there was the tree in Animal Kingdom. It dominated the landscape and, long after Disney has gone, I proclaimed, the Tree would survive. In reality, the Tree of Life is concrete, 18 months of sculptors' work, shaped out of the forms of hundreds of animals. </p> <p>Three months ago, down by Epcot's \"World Showcase Lagoon\", the Walt Disney Company launched its Millennium Village, which offers potted versions of \"world cultures\" from small nations; the nightly Tapestry of Nations which I expected to be some kind of parade; and IllumiNations 2000, said to be the world's largest nightly firework show. </p> <p>The Lagoon is ringed by national pavilions - Japan, Norway, Germany et al. Pre-launch, the Village had teething problems. The kind that come when reality bites the Disney bum. The Arab states denounced the Israeli foreign ministry's film at the Israel exhibit for apparently proclaiming Jerusalem as Israel's capital. It didn't by the time I got to it. Quite dire, inadvertently reminiscent of the The Fast Show - Jerusalem? Fantastic! Faith! - it was just over the way from Saudi Arabia, where Sony touchscreen search by topic offered Henna, Haj and Desert. I couldn't find Beheadings. </p> <p>The launch ceremony itself featured a Disney spokesman on \"bringing the world together through understanding\". It was just unfortunate timing-wise. Over in Millennium Village, Indonesia was \"celebrating the artists of the world\"; elsewhere it was bringing East Timor together by burning it down. At the launch, a UN undersecretary for communications quoted Oscar Wilde and other dead sages. I brooded on the US's failure to pay its $1.6 billion back subs to the UN. </p> <p>Then on came Maya Angelou, who hit out in various languages by proclaiming \"we are more alike than we are unalike\". Cute kids sang about sharing a dream of the future. It was the kind of morning that drops a jaw like Terror Tower shifts an elevator. It did not bode well for the parade. </p> <p>Late that afternoon, I made it to the British Pavilion on World Showcase Lagoon. It was an ordinary kind of British day. I ate fish and chips from the Yorkshire chippie opposite Hampton Court and drank ice-cold Bass from the Rose and Crown (no under-21s served alcohol). A fellow was mashing apples for cider, as they do, by the tea-shop, and the Beatles were singing I Saw Her Standing There on the village green. I crossed the bridge into France for the parade. </p> <p>The noise hit first, vast percussion units, then puppets, performers on stilts, flares. Sounds and colour changed as it passed. I speculated on how many art historians, designers, painters Disney had recruited. I thought of medieval carnivals, Notting Hill and Brazil, the French Revolution's Thermidor and the vast f tes for the Supreme Being and the Republic. The Tapestry of Nations, a f&amp;#egrave;te for consumers and by a corporation, was art and induced emotion on the streets, but then Disney had created the streets, too. The Princess Di effect, I realised, could be induced. </p> <p>The fireworks were impressive, the parade had been staggering. Afterwards, I walked on past lamb-roasting and fire-dancers in Morocco, Lord of the Dance in America, bratwurst in Germany, but no whale in Norway. In the night, reality didn't bite. I had arrived in another world. Specifically, an Italy of La Dolce Vita and Fellini, Roma with carabinieri and Alfas and people in the square eating huge bowls of pasta and a trio singing Volare, just like they always should in Italy. </p> <p>I glimpsed a woman roaming through the crowds, product placement clearly extended to Commedia dell'Arte. She was wearing a mask that could have been 18th century, could have been the Borgias. It stopped me dead. She glanced at me. The mask was timeless. The mask was reality.</p> <p> <strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Four nights at Disney World/three nights cruise (or vice versa) including flights, transfers/car hire and access to the theme parks is around \u00a3919 per head (half price for children under 12). Nigel Fountain flew Virgin Atlantic to Orlando; Virgin Holidays information (01293 456 789).

Afterwards, I walked on past lamb-roasting and fire-dancers in Morocco, Lord of the Dance in America, bratwurst in Germany, but no whale in Norway. In the night, reality didn't bite. I had arrived in another world. Specifically, an Italy of La Dolce Vita and Fellini, Roma with carabinieri and Alfas and people in the square eating huge bowls of pasta and a trio singing Volare, just like they always should in Italy. I glimpsed a woman roaming through the crowds, product placement clearly extended to Commedia dell'Arte. She was wearing a mask that could have been 18th century, could have been the Borgias. It stopped me dead. She glanced at me. The mask was timeless. The mask was reality. The practicals Four nights at Disney World/three nights cruise (or vice versa) including flights, transfers/car hire and access to the theme parks is around \u00a3919 per head (half price for children under 12). Nigel Fountain flew Virgin Atlantic to Orlando; Virgin Holidays information (01293 456 789). Simon Veness's A Brit's Guide to Orlando Florida and Walt Disney World 2000 (Foulsham \u00a310.99) provides a route through the possibilities.",

This Cambridge professor, fellow of Trinity, fellow of the British Academy, member of the Athenaeum, and engine extraordinary of the development of British criminology, never conformed to the stereotype of the English academic, quite apart from the small matter of his Polish name.</p> <p>While he made no secret of his unbounded admiration for the institutions of his adopted country (he was naturalised in 1947), \"Radzy\", as he was known, remained the essential European. He could switch between English, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Polish as readily as from one television channel to another. His urbane manner was matched by a wry sense of humour, an often unexpected generosity and an excellent taste in wine.</p> <p>He could be good company for lunch at the Athenaeum, dinner in Trinity or over tea and toasted teacakes at Brown's Hotel - he retained a strangely boyish affection for the atmosphere of that establishment.</p> <p>He had what no one else did, the necessary combination of vision, tireless energy and Machiavellian wit to make criminology an intellectually and politically respectable discipline. But whatever he did, he did it with success and \u00e9lan.</p> <p>Unlike criminologists Hermann Mannheim and Max Grunhut, who prudently fled Germany soon after the rise of Hitler and arrived in Britain relatively penniless, surviving on the charity of academic communities, Radzinowicz had been a peripatetic European scholar.</p> <p>In 1924, at the age of 18, he arrived at the University of Paris; in 1926, he moved to Geneva to take a law degree and, in 1927, he graduated with another from the University of Rome. In 1938, Radzy came to England to report on the English penal system for the Polish ministry of justice. This was the year of Munich, and the following year Hitler invaded Poland. Radzy was astute enough to see what was happening and took refuge in the law faculty at Cambridge; there he spent the rest of his academic life.</p> <p>Criminology in England had, until the arrival of these emigr\u00e9s, been a minority interest of the medical profession. It was seen as having little relevance to penal policy and less to forensic aspects of criminal justice. Judges treated it in like fashion.</p> <p>Mannheim, at the London School of Economics, became the \"father\" of modern English criminology. Without his teaching in the 40s and 50s, the present generation of academic criminologists would not exist. But he was a proud man who never entirely abandoned the formalities of his youth, when he had been a Prussian officer and judge; he lacked the social skills to give the subject the public legitimacy crucial to its survival; he upset so many people that he was never to have the professorial accolade.</p> <p>In 1957, the Conservative home secretary, RA Butler, approached London university about establishing an institute of criminology; Mannheim, though he had a record of empirical and policy-oriented research, was not even consulted. At a private lunch given by the vice-chancellor, the principal, Douglas Logan, dismissed Mannheim's claims in a single sentence, but praised Radzinowicz, whom he knew well as a fellow Fellow of Trinity. The lunch was attended by the under secretary of state at the home office and the secretary of the royal commission on capital punishment, on which Radzinowicz had served.</p> <p>At the time, many in London, not least Mannheim, believed that the whole thing had been a stitch-up and the man with the needle was Logan. It will never be possible to know why the vice-chancellor did not acknowledge, let alone reply, to Butler's letter until prompted by the home secretary's private office. Did Radzy know what was going on behind the academic arras? It seems inconceivable that he did not, but the Old Fox, another of his nicknames, would have been far too wily to have left the least incriminating scent.</p> <p>Mannheim wasted a disproportionate amount of energy in his retirement expressing his hatred of the \"upstart Pole\"; this degenerated into such an obsession that any former pupil who visited Cambridge was re-categorised as an \"unperson\". But by 1959 the institute was established in Cambridge. Radzinowicz became the first professor of criminology in Britain and some of Her Majesty's judges began to accept invitations to contribute to the institute's seminars.</p> <p>Radzinowicz had already achieved much in wartime and postwar Cambridge and the institute was established on sound foundations. He had carved a niche in the law faculty and, by 1948, he had his fellowship at Trinity. By 1949, he was appointed a member of the Gowers commission on capital punishment. The first volume of his magnum opus, A History Of English Criminal Law Since 1750, appeared in 1948, and the last in 1986.</p> <p>These five massive volumes stand as testimony to his prodigious industry. Not that they were the result of only one man's labour down the years. Radzy's enemies have ascribed to his various co-workers the greater part of particular volumes. For all that his mind ranged the horizons of the subject quick as a falcon's eye, his individual writings were probably not outstanding. It was the immediacy of his persona that was memorable; he was a master of the spoken word.</p> <p>His membership of the Gowers commission stood him in good stead, for he made friends in the home office and in the shadows of the political establishment. Trinity and the Athenaeum came in handy for such things and lesser, and younger, mortals got the toasted teacakes. He was never short of money.</p> <p>In 1966, there was a major scandal following the escape of the Soviet spy George Blake, who had just been sentenced to 42 years' imprisonment. The Labour home secretary, Roy Jenkins, appointed Earl Mountbatten to report. Radzy's seat on the advisory council on the penal system led to his becoming chairman of the sub-committee that considered Mountbatten's proposals for maximum security prisons in 1967-8. He came out in favour not of Mountbatten's idea of a concentration of high risk prisoners in one place but of the preferred home office option of dispersal.</p> <p>Mountbatten was furious, which must have troubled Radzy, since he was totally sycophantic about royalty; the history of the dispersal policy has been the unmitigated failure its critics predicted. Perhaps, knowing the tide, he judged it better not to go against it. Yet, from his introduction to a book by Richard Sparks in 1971, he clearly saw what was happening in the English prison system and made few bones about it.</p> <p>In 1986, he spoke at a reception in Lincoln's Inn to mark the publication of the final volume of his History (the Conservative home secretary was the principal guest) and his asides made little secret of contempt in which he held Thatcherite social policies and the mess of British society, never mind its prisons. By this time, he lived in Philadelphia.</p> <p>His knighthood came in 1970, shortly before his retirement from the Wolfson chair. At last he could feel on equal terms with those senior civil servants whom he had assiduously cultivated down the years, although (not too secretly) his heart had been set on a peerage. He was not to be presented in their Lordships' house, but his retirement dinner was unforgettable.</p> <p>For many years, Cambridge held regular conferences on criminology and these had become feudal gatherings at which fealty was paid to a liege lord; except that a number of young squires had begun to have their own show, what was to be the York deviancy symposium.</p> <p>In the paranoid climate of British universities, Radzy was genuinely fearful of the activities of these leftist critics of orthodox criminology and the establishment. Unfortunately, quite a few of them were at his retirement dinner during a conference. Congratulatory messages were read out like wedding telegrams while Radzy, surrounded by the senior home civil service, surveyed the company like a headmaster seeking out absentees on speech day.

Eight years after becoming Russia's first ever democratically elected president - a mandate he used to combat and destroy Soviet communism as a political force - Mr Yeltsin went on national television to announce in dignified, if melancholy, terms that he was bowing out. In the Kremlin, he handed the symbolic and concrete trappings of office to Mr Putin - the seals and chain of the Russian presidency, the briefcase containing the codes and controls for Russia's vast nuclear arsenal, and the pen he has used for the past eight years to sign laws and decrees into force. Flanked by a Christmas tree for his brief television statement from the Kremlin, Mr Yeltsin, 68, a towering, boisterous and unpredictable presence on the international scene for the past decade, asked Russians' forgiveness for his failings. He delivered an unequivocal endorsement of Mr Putin, whom he named as his preferred successor when he appointed him prime minister last August. \"I am stepping down early. I understand that I must do that and Russia must enter the new millennium with new politicians, new faces, new intelligent, strong, energetic people,\" said Mr Yeltsin. \"We who have been in power for many years must go...

The president's decision, said Anatoli Chubais, another key Kremlin crony, was \"a stroke of genius\". \"It was the perfect decision, courageous and profound,\" he said.

But once in charge of a huge, complex domain embroiled in revolutionary change, his touch was less than sure.</p> <p>The democracy he helped to build but also to distort is venal, fragile, unpredictable and boisterous. Perhaps it had to be like that. But maybe not.</p> <p>Mr Yeltsin was a regular Soviet man, born poor, risen up the career ladder, fond of sport, fond of his family, fond of vodka, sentimental, anxious not to have fewer possessions than his peers, looking out for his friends, and with a world view shaped by the obsessions and omissions of Soviet popular culture.</p> <p>An ordinary Russian who met the president wouldn't feel awkward about telling him a joke, complaining to him or recommending a folk cold cure. Even while hugely unpopular in the last two years of his reign, Mr Yeltsin never became a target of hate, more of pity and contempt.</p> <p>If Mr Gorbachev was the midwife of Soviet then Russian democracy, Boris Yeltsin was its first big beneficiary. He will want to go down in the history books as the man who buried more than 70 years of Soviet communism.</p> <p>It remains an open question how much the massive changes that followed, malign and benign, can be ascribed to Mr Yeltsin, how much is attributable to the radical steps Mr Gorbachev had already taken, and how much was the product of forces beyond anyone's control.</p> <p>Russians now inhabit a country of 143m people; the USSR - which Mr Yeltsin was instrumental in breaking up to weaken the Soviet president's power - was almost double that.</p> <p><b> Others got blame</b><br></p> <p>Back in 1991 when Mr Yeltsin was elected as the Russian president who would see off the Communists, there were still a handful of political prisoners; now they are free, but the crowded, hungry, tuberculosis-ridden prison camps have not been so full of criminals - many convicted for the pettiest of crimes - since Khrushchev's time in the 50s and 60s.</p> <p>In 1991, the Russian army of 3.2m was respected and feared in the west. The army Mr Yeltsin leaves his successor as commander-in-chief supposedly has 1.2m personnel and is widely disregarded.</p> <p>During the Yeltsin years, crime soared, and murder became a common method of settling business disputes. The English word \"killer\", meaning hitman, has become part of Russia's everyday vocabulary. Without constraints, the marriage of corrupt bureaucrats, ruthless racketeers and parasitic businessmen was solemnised.</p> <p>In 1991, the militarised, deformed Soviet economic giant was already disintegrating, and the embezzlers were already settling to feed on its mines, oil wells and smelters. Mr Yeltsin's rule has seen the Russian economy shrivel to a fraction of its former size, with millions unemployed or working without pay. Millions more were caught up in migrations from dying areas, or independent republics that no longer wanted ethnic Russians.</p> <p>The system now corresponds to no traditional economic model, medieval in its reliance on payment in kind, primitive in its rapaciousness, modern in its cosmopolitan, opportunistic cross-border trade.</p> <p>People's lives have changed greatly from the daily round of queuing, exchanging favours and sniffing round the black market. The number of households with cars and video recorders has soared.</p> <p>Yet one of the saddest sights in Moscow in the week of Mr Yeltsin's resignation has been the search of ordinary, poor Muscovites for a Christmas tree, or rather a new year tree, that they can afford.</p> <p>In the land of the Siberian fir where the forests stretch for thousands of miles, the Moscow market hawkers are trying to flog Danish and Norwegian trees for $100 a time, so most people forlornly settle for a few sprigs of pine or fir. Such are the new market freedoms.</p> <p>The battle for democracy in Russia has been only partly won and the parliamentary election two weeks ago that paved the way for yesterday's installation of Vladimir Putin as presidential heir was seriously flawed.</p> <p>The electoral process has forced many local governors to listen to their citizens' needs. But in other regions, particularly the ethnically based autonomous republics, elections have been a sham, strengthening local tyrants who abuse the trust of their ethnic kin and discriminate against the ethnic Russians.</p> <p>But democracy is on the way to being taken for granted. So, now, is the right to travel freely: millions have, for the first time in the country's history, been able to see the outside world with their own eyes, beginning to heal the insularity that blighted the USSR.</p> <p>Looking back over the Yeltsin years, it is hard to escape the conclusion that most of what is positive happened not because of Mr Yeltsin but in spite of him. Most of what is negative, however, happened either because he never bothered to engage in policy - as in the economic collapses that robbed Russians of their savings three times in a row - or because of decisions he took personally.</p> <p>There is nothing to suggest the president ever thought deeply, let alone understood, basic market mechanisms. He confined himself to hiring, sacking and rehiring aides and ministers, casually hobbling policy initiatives if someone he liked lobbied him against them, and making ringing declarations about the economy which bore no relation to reality.</p> <p>Whenever anything went disastrously wrong, he blamed the government he himself had appointed, or he simply disappeared.</p> <p>Economic mayhem and corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the crucial failures of the Yeltsin years. Many of his actions suggest that he believed himself, as president, to be above the law.</p> <p>It was Boris Yeltsin who ordered the KGB archives closed in 1992 to conceal the crimes of the communist years. It was Boris Yeltsin who illegally dissolved parliament in 1993 and tried to dissolve it again in 1996.</p> <p>It was Boris Yeltsin who protected scores of powerful friends from criminal investigation. In the twilight years of the presidency he and his immediate family became the subjects of Swiss corruption allegations involving an Albanian businessman alleged to have provided the president and his influential daughter Tatiana with western credit cards in return for lucrative contracts.</p> <p>It was Boris Yeltsin who ordered the military campaign, not once but twice, to bring the breakaway republic of Chechnya into line, and then lied and lied again about what was taking place there.</p> <p>The Yeltsin family cruised into office like lottery winners, with their first obligations to themselves, their next to their friends, associates and hangers-on, and their last, absent-mindedly, to the outer circle, the people.</p> <p><b>It was all chance</b><br></p> <p>One of the Yeltsins' first moves was to strip the furniture and kitchen fittings out of Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev's flat and move it to their own dacha.</p> <p>Besides drinking, hunting and lounging in the sauna with his buddies, Mr Yeltsin had a childlike love of mischief and gadgets. He would pinch female aides. He used to play the spoons, using the bald heads of anyone nearby. He threw his press secretary, Mr Kostikov, off a riverboat on the Volga.</p> <p>Apart from the nuclear \"button\", he was given another button, for when he fell ill and needed to get help. He began summoning doctors all the time, just for fun. A few months after the 1991 coup attempt, with Russia in chaos, Mr Yeltsin was off playing tennis four or five times a week.</p> <p>\"Experts work out entire theories, analyse mythical chains of Kremlin relationships, to logically explain this or that staff appointment,\" wrote his former bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov in his memoirs. \"But there was and is no theory ... since 1991 people casually tumbled into positions of power and, with equal ease, tumbled out. And it wasn't even the personal preferences of Mr Yeltsin ... It was all a matter of chance.\"</p>",

It remains an open question how much the massive changes that followed, malign and benign, can be ascribed to Mr Yeltsin, how much is attributable to the radical steps Mr Gorbachev had already taken, and how much was the product of forces beyond anyone's control. Russians now inhabit a country of 143m people; the USSR - which Mr Yeltsin was instrumental in breaking up to weaken the Soviet president's power - was almost double that. Others got blame Back in 1991 when Mr Yeltsin was elected as the Russian president who would see off the Communists, there were still a handful of political prisoners; now they are free, but the crowded, hungry, tuberculosis-ridden prison camps have not been so full of criminals - many convicted for the pettiest of crimes - since Khrushchev's time in the 50s and 60s. In 1991, the Russian army of 3.2m was respected and feared in the west. The army Mr Yeltsin leaves his successor as commander-in-chief supposedly has 1.2m personnel and is widely disregarded. During the Yeltsin years, crime soared, and murder became a common method of settling business disputes. The English word \"killer\", meaning hitman, has become part of Russia's everyday vocabulary. Without constraints, the marriage of corrupt bureaucrats, ruthless racketeers and parasitic businessmen was solemnised. In 1991, the militarised, deformed Soviet economic giant was already disintegrating, and the embezzlers were already settling to feed on its mines, oil wells and smelters. Mr Yeltsin's rule has seen the Russian economy shrivel to a fraction of its former size, with millions unemployed or working without pay. Millions more were caught up in migrations from dying areas, or independent republics that no longer wanted ethnic Russians. The system now corresponds to no traditional economic model, medieval in its reliance on payment in kind, primitive in its rapaciousness, modern in its cosmopolitan, opportunistic cross-border trade. People's lives have changed greatly from the daily round of queuing, exchanging favours and sniffing round the black market. The number of households with cars and video recorders has soared. Yet one of the saddest sights in Moscow in the week of Mr Yeltsin's resignation has been the search of ordinary, poor Muscovites for a Christmas tree, or rather a new year tree, that they can afford. In the land of the Siberian fir where the forests stretch for thousands of miles, the Moscow market hawkers are trying to flog Danish and Norwegian trees for $100 a time, so most people forlornly settle for a few sprigs of pine or fir. Such are the new market freedoms. The battle for democracy in Russia has been only partly won and the parliamentary election two weeks ago that paved the way for yesterday's installation of Vladimir Putin as presidential heir was seriously flawed. The electoral process has forced many local governors to listen to their citizens' needs. But in other regions, particularly the ethnically based autonomous republics, elections have been a sham, strengthening local tyrants who abuse the trust of their ethnic kin and discriminate against the ethnic Russians. But democracy is on the way to being taken for granted. So, now, is the right to travel freely: millions have, for the first time in the country's history, been able to see the outside world with their own eyes, beginning to heal the insularity that blighted the USSR. Looking back over the Yeltsin years, it is hard to escape the conclusion that most of what is positive happened not because of Mr Yeltsin but in spite of him. Most of what is negative, however, happened either because he never bothered to engage in policy - as in the economic collapses that robbed Russians of their savings three times in a row - or because of decisions he took personally. There is nothing to suggest the president ever thought deeply, let alone understood, basic market mechanisms. He confined himself to hiring, sacking and rehiring aides and ministers, casually hobbling policy initiatives if someone he liked lobbied him against them, and making ringing declarations about the economy which bore no relation to reality. Whenever anything went disastrously wrong, he blamed the government he himself had appointed, or he simply disappeared. Economic mayhem and corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the crucial failures of the Yeltsin years. Many of his actions suggest that he believed himself, as president, to be above the law. It was Boris Yeltsin who ordered the KGB archives closed in 1992 to conceal the crimes of the communist years. It was Boris Yeltsin who illegally dissolved parliament in 1993 and tried to dissolve it again in 1996. It was Boris Yeltsin who protected scores of powerful friends from criminal investigation. In the twilight years of the presidency he and his immediate family became the subjects of Swiss corruption allegations involving an Albanian businessman alleged to have provided the president and his influential daughter Tatiana with western credit cards in return for lucrative contracts. It was Boris Yeltsin who ordered the military campaign, not once but twice, to bring the breakaway republic of Chechnya into line, and then lied and lied again about what was taking place there. The Yeltsin family cruised into office like lottery winners, with their first obligations to themselves, their next to their friends, associates and hangers-on, and their last, absent-mindedly, to the outer circle, the people. It was all chance One of the Yeltsins' first moves was to strip the furniture and kitchen fittings out of Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev's flat and move it to their own dacha. Besides drinking, hunting and lounging in the sauna with his buddies, Mr Yeltsin had a childlike love of mischief and gadgets. He would pinch female aides. He used to play the spoons, using the bald heads of anyone nearby. He threw his press secretary, Mr Kostikov, off a riverboat on the Volga. Apart from the nuclear \"button\", he was given another button, for when he fell ill and needed to get help. He began summoning doctors all the time, just for fun. A few months after the 1991 coup attempt, with Russia in chaos, Mr Yeltsin was off playing tennis four or five times a week. \"Experts work out entire theories, analyse mythical chains of Kremlin relationships, to logically explain this or that staff appointment,\" wrote his former bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov in his memoirs. \"But there was and is no theory ... since 1991 people casually tumbled into positions of power and, with equal ease, tumbled out. And it wasn't even the personal preferences of Mr Yeltsin ... It was all a matter of chance.\"",

      "body": "<p>Following are extracts from Boris Yeltsin's televised resignation statement.</p> <p>Dear friends, today I am addressing you for the last time as Russian president. On the last day of the century, I am retiring.</p> <p>Many times I have heard it said: Yeltsin will try to hold on to power, he won't hand it over. That is lies.</p> <p>I always said I would not take a single step away from the constitution, that the duma elections should take place within the constitutional timescale. This has happened. And likewise, I would have liked the presidential elections to have taken place on schedule in June 2000.</p> <p>That was very important for Russia - we were creating a vital precedent of a civilised, voluntary handover of power from one president to another, newly elected one. And yet, I have taken a different decision. I am standing down earlier than scheduled.</p> <p>Russia must enter the new millennium with new politicians, new faces, intelligent, strong and energetic people. Those of us who have been in power for many years must go.</p> <p>I have done the main job of my life. Russia will never return to the past. I must not stand in the way of the natural progress of history.</p> <p>Why hold on to power for another six months when the country has a strong person, fit to be president. Why should I stand in his way? This is not me.</p> <p>Today, on this incredibly important day for me, I want to ask you for forgiveness, because many of our hopes have not come true, because what we thought would be easy turned out to be painfully difficult. I ask you to forgive me for not fulfilling some hopes of those people who believed that we would be able to jump from the totalitarian past into a bright, rich and civilised future in one go.</p> <p>I myself believed this. But it could not be done in one fell swoop. In some respects I was too naive. Some problems were too complex. We struggled on through mistakes and failures. Many people experienced upheavals in their lives. But I want you to know that I never said this would be easy.</p> <p>Today it is important for me to tell you I also experienced the pain which each of you experienced. I experienced it in my heart, with sleepless nights, agonising over what needed to be done to ensure people lived more easily and better. I did not have any objective more important than that.</p> <p>I am leaving. I have done everything I could. I am not leaving because of my health, but because of all the problems taken together. A new generation is taking my place, the generation of those who can do more and do it better.</p> <p>In accordance with the constitution, I have signed a decree entrusting the duties of president to prime minister Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>For the next three months - again in accordance with the constitution - he will be head of state. Presidential elections will be held in three months' time. I have no doubt what choice you will make at the end of March 2000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Following are extracts from Boris Yeltsin's televised resignation statement. Dear friends, today I am addressing you for the last time as Russian president. On the last day of the century, I am retiring. Many times I have heard it said: Yeltsin will try to hold on to power, he won't hand it over. That is lies. I always said I would not take a single step away from the constitution, that the duma elections should take place within the constitutional timescale. This has happened. And likewise, I would have liked the presidential elections to have taken place on schedule in June 2000. That was very important for Russia - we were creating a vital precedent of a civilised, voluntary handover of power from one president to another, newly elected one. And yet, I have taken a different decision. I am standing down earlier than scheduled. Russia must enter the new millennium with new politicians, new faces, intelligent, strong and energetic people. Those of us who have been in power for many years must go. I have done the main job of my life. Russia will never return to the past. I must not stand in the way of the natural progress of history. Why hold on to power for another six months when the country has a strong person, fit to be president. Why should I stand in his way? This is not me. Today, on this incredibly important day for me, I want to ask you for forgiveness, because many of our hopes have not come true, because what we thought would be easy turned out to be painfully difficult. I ask you to forgive me for not fulfilling some hopes of those people who believed that we would be able to jump from the totalitarian past into a bright, rich and civilised future in one go. I myself believed this. But it could not be done in one fell swoop. In some respects I was too naive. Some problems were too complex. We struggled on through mistakes and failures. Many people experienced upheavals in their lives. But I want you to know that I never said this would be easy. Today it is important for me to tell you I also experienced the pain which each of you experienced. I experienced it in my heart, with sleepless nights, agonising over what needed to be done to ensure people lived more easily and better. I did not have any objective more important than that. I am leaving. I have done everything I could. I am not leaving because of my health, but because of all the problems taken together. A new generation is taking my place, the generation of those who can do more and do it better. In accordance with the constitution, I have signed a decree entrusting the duties of president to prime minister Vladimir Putin. For the next three months - again in accordance with the constitution - he will be head of state. Presidential elections will be held in three months' time. I have no doubt what choice you will make at the end of March 2000.",

      "bodyText": "The first of 155 hostages freed from a hijacked Indian Airlines plane landed to tumultuous scenes at New Delhi airport last night after a week-long ordeal that spanned five countries and cost a new groom his life. The passengers looked weary as children rushed forward with flowers and the mother of one hostage fainted. One man stooped down and kissed the ground. Waiting relatives threw bouquets into the air and garlanded some of the passengers as they arrived from the southern Afghanistan city of Kandahar where their plane had been held. Some of the hostages had to be supported to walk, but still waved to the crowd. All passengers and crew walked to freedom earlier after India agreed to the hijackers' demands to free three Kashmiri militants from jail and allow them to walk away, an act that caused a sizeable dent in national pride. The masked hijackers, who slit the throat of a newly married man last weekend, left the plane and drove into Kandahar in a deal overseen by Indian foreign minister Jaswant Singh. They had commandeered the Indian Airlines plane on Christmas Eve en route from Nepal to New Delhi. Their destination last night was a mystery but the closest country with ties to Kashmir is Pakistan. However, a spokesman for Pakistan's military government said in Islamabad last night that he doubted the hijackers were on their way to his country. Afghanistan's Taliban movement said it would force the hijackers and freed militants to leave Afghanistan if they did not heed a 10-hour deadline to quit.",

The deal looked to be on the rocks last month when Edmund Safra, the founder of Republic, was killed in his Monaco home. A spokesman said the US bank would \"fit with HSBC's businesses\". The deal doubles HSBC's private banking business to 55,000 clients with $120bn funds under management. It will also have the third-largest branch network in New York State. Red Christmas for e-commerce Retailers offering online sales suffered \u00a375m of operating losses at Christmas despite estimated internet sales of over \u00a3200m, according to a report by consultancy E-Insight. Online discounting, heavy marketing costs, and inefficient order processing made for a costly e-Christmas, especially for conventional retailers dabbling with internet trading, E-Insight said. The analysis shows that the earnings models of start-up e-commerce ventures in the UK and US led to estimated losses of 35%-45% of internet sales in 1999 with established high street players suffering further losses.",

More countries than ever before officially play the game as members of Fifa. Satellite television has created millions of new fans. Manchester United's triumph in the European Cup final last May was, quite literally, cheered to the ends of the earth. </p> <p>There would appear to be no tangible reason why this happy state of affairs should not continue for a long while yet. Fresh fields are about to open up in Asia, which in two years' time will stage its first World Cup. How long will China remain a sleeping giant? </p> <p>Africa, already a rich source of talent, is bound to provide an increasing number of gifted players for European clubs. South Africa appears increasingly likely to win the Fifa vote for hosting the next World Cup but only provided it can begin to get to grips with the country's crime wave. </p> <p>In those areas where football has been established much longer, optimism needs to tread more warily. South America continues to produce some of the world's greatest players but for the past three decades economic factors have dictated that virtually all of them will end up earning hard currency in western Europe. </p> <p>This seems to be the footballing equivalent of cutting down the rainforests. Should the flow of South American talent ever slow to a trickle the effect on global football would be alarming. Brazil and Argentina remain as precious to the future of the game as any European nation. </p> <p>Association football has been around for a mere 137 years, a relatively short time in millennium terms, yet still manages to behave as if it had a divine right to exist for ever more. That is a lot to take for granted. </p> <p>The appeal of the sport has always been its simplicity and continuity. Football is not a stop-start game. In theory there should be no reason to halt play other than for goals, assuming there are any, and half-time. </p> <p>The laws have survived the past 100 years largely unaltered. The only radical change came in 1925 when the number of opponents required to keep an attacker onside was reduced from three to two. </p> <p>At present the interpretation of the offside law, which has almost always been the biggest bone of contention between referees and players, is about right. Goals can quite properly be allowed if attackers, while in offside positions, are obviously not interfering with play. This, after all, is the original spirit in which the law was framed. </p> <p>No more tinkering with the way the game is played should be necessary. Fifa has surely gone as far as it can in restricting methods of tackling without ruling out tackling altogether, as was seriously proposed at one point. Fortunately this wheeze, like the nonsense about enlarging the goals, came to nothing. </p> <p>However, the 21st century may soon see drastic developments in the way matches are controlled. Refereeing controversies have become endemic because the ways television can expose and analyse decisions are becoming increasingly sophisticated. </p> <p>An already strong temptation to make TV the referee's friend rather than his enemy may prove impossible to resist. A fourth official studying incidents on closed-circuit television and giving his decision through an ear-piece may eventually become as much a part of football as cricket, although spectators might quickly tire of the disruptions to matches this would cause. </p> <p>Either way television, or rather television money, remains central to football's future as an entertainment. In England the hard bargaining over the next TV contract is about to begin in earnest with a figure of \u00a31bn already common parlance. </p> <p>The 2002 and 2006 World Cups will not be completely available to terrestrial viewers and Fifa's insistence that in each country every match played by the national team, along with the opening match, semi-finals, third-place game and final, must not go to pay-TV cannot hide the fact that under such a system one of the greatest matches ever played, the 1986 quarter-final between France and Brazil, would in Britain only have been seen live on Sky. </p> <p>The Premier League's breaking of the BBC-ITV cartel released extra TV millions into the English game and helped, with the Football Trust, to underwrite the cost of building some of the world's safest and most comfortable stadiums. It also attracted the sort of foreign player who previously would never have dreamed of passing up the fortunes being made in continental Europe in order to take a wage cut for the dubious pleasure of being kicked from behind in England. </p> <p>The new century urgently needs to witness genuine attempts by the clubs to restore an acceptable balance between overseas imports and home-grown products at present in danger of being squeezed out by short-term solutions from abroad. Inflated domestic transfer fees used to be the reason quoted for buying foreign. Now, post-Bosman, the greater problem concerns salaries that continue on an ever-upward spiral. </p> <p>Far less fuss was made about Roy Keane's recent \u00a350,000-a-week contract at Manchester United than on the day in 1961 when Johnny Haynes became the first footballer to earn a weekly wage of \u00a3100. Yet the amount United have had to pay to keep Keane at home, combined with the even greater sums he could still earn in Italy or Spain, will surely usher in the 21st century against a cacophonous background of players' agents trying to obtain proportionately increased deals for their own stars. </p> <p>For the moment, talk of wage-capping is just that but a showdown with the Professional Footballers' Association cannot be far off. At the beginning of the 60s the \u00a320-a-week ceiling was abolished. Now most clubs would regard a limit of \u00a320,000-a-week as a not unreasonable basis for negotiation even though this would risk losing the best English talents abroad, not to mention a sudden outbreak of homesickness among the Premier League's foreign legion . </p> <p>Football should be entering the new century aware of its limitations. There has to be a limit to what players can earn and the extra amounts spectators can be charged in order to finance higher wage bills. </p> <p>Television coverage may not be at saturation point because most of the live stuff is exclusive to Sky's relatively small audience but how much more can viewers be asked to cough up - and is digital pay-per-view going to be that popular anyway? </p> <p>The worst prospect for football in the new century would be a global satellite TV cartel telling clubs that if they wanted a better deal they had better sound out the Martians. By that time, no doubt, Dan Dare will be in charge of the England team for the Inter-World Cup on Venus, where there has never been a shortage of left-headed midfield players.</p>",

Goals can quite properly be allowed if attackers, while in offside positions, are obviously not interfering with play. This, after all, is the original spirit in which the law was framed. No more tinkering with the way the game is played should be necessary. Fifa has surely gone as far as it can in restricting methods of tackling without ruling out tackling altogether, as was seriously proposed at one point. Fortunately this wheeze, like the nonsense about enlarging the goals, came to nothing. However, the 21st century may soon see drastic developments in the way matches are controlled. Refereeing controversies have become endemic because the ways television can expose and analyse decisions are becoming increasingly sophisticated. An already strong temptation to make TV the referee's friend rather than his enemy may prove impossible to resist. A fourth official studying incidents on closed-circuit television and giving his decision through an ear-piece may eventually become as much a part of football as cricket, although spectators might quickly tire of the disruptions to matches this would cause. Either way television, or rather television money, remains central to football's future as an entertainment. In England the hard bargaining over the next TV contract is about to begin in earnest with a figure of \u00a31bn already common parlance. The 2002 and 2006 World Cups will not be completely available to terrestrial viewers and Fifa's insistence that in each country every match played by the national team, along with the opening match, semi-finals, third-place game and final, must not go to pay-TV cannot hide the fact that under such a system one of the greatest matches ever played, the 1986 quarter-final between France and Brazil, would in Britain only have been seen live on Sky. The Premier League's breaking of the BBC-ITV cartel released extra TV millions into the English game and helped, with the Football Trust, to underwrite the cost of building some of the world's safest and most comfortable stadiums. It also attracted the sort of foreign player who previously would never have dreamed of passing up the fortunes being made in continental Europe in order to take a wage cut for the dubious pleasure of being kicked from behind in England. The new century urgently needs to witness genuine attempts by the clubs to restore an acceptable balance between overseas imports and home-grown products at present in danger of being squeezed out by short-term solutions from abroad. Inflated domestic transfer fees used to be the reason quoted for buying foreign. Now, post-Bosman, the greater problem concerns salaries that continue on an ever-upward spiral. Far less fuss was made about Roy Keane's recent \u00a350,000-a-week contract at Manchester United than on the day in 1961 when Johnny Haynes became the first footballer to earn a weekly wage of \u00a3100. Yet the amount United have had to pay to keep Keane at home, combined with the even greater sums he could still earn in Italy or Spain, will surely usher in the 21st century against a cacophonous background of players' agents trying to obtain proportionately increased deals for their own stars. For the moment, talk of wage-capping is just that but a showdown with the Professional Footballers' Association cannot be far off. At the beginning of the 60s the \u00a320-a-week ceiling was abolished. Now most clubs would regard a limit of \u00a320,000-a-week as a not unreasonable basis for negotiation even though this would risk losing the best English talents abroad, not to mention a sudden outbreak of homesickness among the Premier League's foreign legion . Football should be entering the new century aware of its limitations. There has to be a limit to what players can earn and the extra amounts spectators can be charged in order to finance higher wage bills. Television coverage may not be at saturation point because most of the live stuff is exclusive to Sky's relatively small audience but how much more can viewers be asked to cough up - and is digital pay-per-view going to be that popular anyway? The worst prospect for football in the new century would be a global satellite TV cartel telling clubs that if they wanted a better deal they had better sound out the Martians. By that time, no doubt, Dan Dare will be in charge of the England team for the Inter-World Cup on Venus, where there has never been a shortage of left-headed midfield players.",

The Superga air crash of 1949, which wiped out a Torino team including eight internationals, delayed Italy's re-emergence post-war but Ernst Ocwirk led another distinguished Austrian side until first the Hungarians and then the Brazilians took over. Ferenc Puskas would get into most people's World XI and, as for Brazil, where do you begin? There has never been a greater footballer than Pele although two Argentines, Alfredo di Stefano and Diego Maradona, run him close. But what about Didi, Vava, Tostao, Garrincha, Rivelino and Zico, along with Romario, Rivaldo and Ronaldo now? Johan Cruyff remains the best footballer produced in Europe over the past three decades with Johan Neeskens, Wim van Hanegem, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp a strong Dutch supporting cast. Fritz Walter, Uwe Seeler, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd M\u00fcller, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Lothar Matth\u00e4us and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann reflect the success of Germany. France should have won more, given men like Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, Michel Platini and Jean Tigana. Bobby Moore has to appear in a 20th-century England defence but so, arguably, does Neil Franklin. Best is worth more than a mention in an Irish-Welsh XI and players of the quality of Liam Brady and Johnny Giles appeared for the Republic as does one of the world's best, Roy Keane, now. England: Gordon Banks; Alf Ramsey, Neil Franklin, Bobby Moore, Ray Wilson; Stanley Matthews, Billy Wright, Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton; Stan Mortensen, Jimmy Greaves. Subs: Frank Swift, Johnny Haynes, Kevin Keegan, Gary Lineker, Paul Gascoigne, Tom Finney. Scotland: Bill Brown; Eric Caldow, George Young, Martin Buchan, Danny McGrain; Jimmy Johnstone, Jim Baxter, Dave Mackay, Alan Morton; Denis Law, Kenny Dalglish. Subs: Jim Leighton, Tommy Gemmell, Billy Bremner, Hughie Gallacher, Lawrie Reilly, Billy Steel. Wales &amp; N Ireland combined: Pat Jennings; Johnny Carey, Allan Hunter, Mike England, Wally Barnes; George Best, Danny Blanchflower, Jimmy McIlroy, Cliff Jones; John Charles, Ian Rush. Subs: Jack Kelsey, Terry Hennessey, Billy Meredith, Ivor Allchurch, Sammy McIlroy, Derek Dougan. Rest of the World: Lev Yashin (USSR); Djalma Santos (Brazil), Franz Beckenbauer (West Germany), Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini (both Italy); Ernst Ocwirk (Austria); Michel Platini (France), Johan Cruyff (Holland); Diego Maradona (Argentina); Pele (Brazil), Alfredo di Stefano (Argentina &amp; Spain). Subs: Gyula Grosics (Hungary), Ruud Gullit (Holland), Juan Schiaffino (Uruguay &amp; Italy), Ferenc Puskas (Hungary), Marco van Basten (Holland), Eusebio (Portugal). International managers: 1 Mario Zagallo (Brazil), 2 Helmut Sch\u00f6n (West Germany), 3 Vittorio Pozzo (Italy), 4 Enzo Bearzot (Italy), 5 Alf Ramsey (England), 6 Rinus Michels (Holland). British managers: 1 Bob Paisley (Liverpool), 2 Jock Stein (Celtic &amp; Leeds United), 3 Herbert Chapman (Huddersfield &amp; Arsenal), 4 Alex Ferguson (Aberdeen &amp; Manchester United), 5 Matt Busby (Manchester United), 6 Brian Clough (Derby County &amp; Nottingham Forest).",

When Hussain says the ball did not reverse, he means Gough was not managing it. </p> <p>The same applies to the spin of Phil Tufnell. Perhaps the most telling deliveries of the last day were those bowled by Mark Butcher, a dabbler with offbreaks who found turn and bounce because he put a few revs on the ball.

He's a fighter and I have full faith that he will be able to overcome these objections raised against him. I don't see his career ending.\" Wasim, Shoaib's new-ball partner, reflected the prevailing view in Pakistan that there is nothing to remedy. \"I have played more cricket than anyone else in the world and I think that his action is fine, more than fine,\" he said. \"The poor guy. I can't imagine what he is feeling. My heart goes out to him.\" Professor Bruce Elliott, an expert in biomechanics at the University of Western Australia, and the man whose three-dimensional computer analysis proved that Muralitharan's action was not illegal, has offered to repeat his study for Shoaib. It is a technological aid that the ICC should consider officially utilising. The ICC will study further video evidence in a month and, if it is satisfied, this could enable Shoaib to return in a home Test series against Sri Lanka.",

      "bodyText": "The Apocalypse British Museum, London Rating: **** Wandering among the glass cabinets in the British Museum's department of prints and drawings, you find yourself poring over interpretations of the Book of Revelation and seeing the same images of ruin down the centuries: St John of Patmos eating the book, the angel who opens the Seventh Seal and pours a \"fiery incense\" on the earth, causing earthquakes, floods and massacres, the Four Horsemen - the Conqueror, War, Famine and, behind them, Death on a Pale Horse. Exhibiting all this stuff on the millennium's eve is great fun, but makes for a mad, occulted labyrinth of an exhibition.

Billed as the Last Supper, this is allegedly Black Sabbath's final bow. Lest we forget, this is the band whose singer Ozzy Osbourne will be remembered for biting the head off a bat onstage; who collectively drank more than four Ollie Reeds; who single-handedly inspired almost every scene in Spinal Tap (pioneering the use of the rock drummer in combustion) and whose guitarist Tony Iommi wore a moustache that would invite prosecution in many civilised countries. But really, Sabbath should be re membered for some of the truly seminal hard rock of the 20th century. And it is this - not the bats - of which they seek to remind us. </p> <p>The gig is like a Nuremburg rally soundtracked by hell's house band. But what is most remarkable is not the 11,000 voices chanting things such as \"The war machine is burning\", an unexpected glimmer of rock's forgotten insurrection, but just how strangely primal Sabbath sound. Any other ageing rock band would rely on technology or additional key board players to embellish their creaking limbs. Sabbath don't. It is just the four of them, in a (very large) room, plugging fabulously into whatever unholy adolescent rage once gave birth to classics such as Electric Funeral. </p> <p>The master of ceremonies is, of course, Osbourne. Sober for many years, Ozzy either has enough demon drink left inside him from the bad days or gets some kind of weird high from inducing pandemonium. At one point, he yells \"Go crazy!\" upon which the crowd start hurling seat cushions into the air, which continues for most of the set. It is almost, well, demonic. </p> <p>But Ozzy solo is not a patch on Oz with Sabbath and the band underline just how much he needs them. Tony Iommi - moustache proudly untrimmed - is surely one of the most underrated rock guitarists of all time. Geezer Butler - long-haired at almost 50 - never once stops headbanging, while Bill Ward proves that not even a heart attack has stopped him remaining the pulse beat of the band. They slip, effortlessly from rock to black funk, and my only gripe is the absence of their overlooked gentler side and that Ozzy asks me to put my hands up around 45 times too often. </p> <p>At the end, things get very emotional. Ozzy hugs the band and they return with a rendition of Paranoid that can presumably be heard in China. Is this the end of Sabbath? I'd guess possibly not. But whatever happens, the world will be a quieter place without them.</p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",
