      "body": "<p>Leeds United have gained some fans here. Passionate supporters of Galatasaray's arch-rivals Fenerbahce have displayed banners during their last couple of games urging the Premiership side to thrash the old enemy from the other side of Istanbul. </p> <p>They will be in a tiny minority tonight, though. Football is a consuming passion for many Turks and most are hoping that Galatasaray will become the first Turkish side to reach a European final. In a country of more than 60m desperate for football success, it has become an issue of national pride. </p> <p>\"If they beat Leeds,\" said Halil Ozer, who follows the team for the daily Milliyet, \"most of Turkey will be singing in the streets for the next three days.\" </p> <p>\"It means everything to them,\" said Galatasaray's veteran Romanian midfielder Gheorghe Hagi. \"The fans here go absolutely crazy.\" </p> <p>When Galatasaray reached this stage, telegrams of congratulation poured in from politicians and business leaders. Small cafes and bars planning to show the Leeds game on cable TV expect long queues and standing room only tonight. </p> <p>At the Ali Sami Yen stadium the club's fanatical support will give Leeds a hot reception, but at Galatasaray's training ground this week there was only an air of quiet confidence. </p> <p>Their coach Fatih Terim, who led the national side to Euro 96 in England, said it was time for Turkish club football to take a big step forward. </p> <p>\"Coaches always want too much,\" he said with a grin, \"but if we can win this game we will be very close to the final.\" </p> <p>Galatasaray have dominated the domestic game here this season. They are six points clear at the top of the First Division and overwhelming favourites to win the Turkish Cup. But, like Leeds, they have stumbled in their past two matches, losing at home to Fenerbahce and managing only a goalless draw against lowly Erzurumspor. </p> <p>But Europe has been the stage for their most dramatic exploits. In the past Turkish teams have suffered from an inferiority complex when they faced clubs from the major European leagues. But no longer.

      "bodyText": "Leeds United have gained some fans here. Passionate supporters of Galatasaray's arch-rivals Fenerbahce have displayed banners during their last couple of games urging the Premiership side to thrash the old enemy from the other side of Istanbul. They will be in a tiny minority tonight, though. Football is a consuming passion for many Turks and most are hoping that Galatasaray will become the first Turkish side to reach a European final. In a country of more than 60m desperate for football success, it has become an issue of national pride. \"If they beat Leeds,\" said Halil Ozer, who follows the team for the daily Milliyet, \"most of Turkey will be singing in the streets for the next three days.\" \"It means everything to them,\" said Galatasaray's veteran Romanian midfielder Gheorghe Hagi. \"The fans here go absolutely crazy.\" When Galatasaray reached this stage, telegrams of congratulation poured in from politicians and business leaders. Small cafes and bars planning to show the Leeds game on cable TV expect long queues and standing room only tonight. At the Ali Sami Yen stadium the club's fanatical support will give Leeds a hot reception, but at Galatasaray's training ground this week there was only an air of quiet confidence. Their coach Fatih Terim, who led the national side to Euro 96 in England, said it was time for Turkish club football to take a big step forward. \"Coaches always want too much,\" he said with a grin, \"but if we can win this game we will be very close to the final.\" Galatasaray have dominated the domestic game here this season. They are six points clear at the top of the First Division and overwhelming favourites to win the Turkish Cup. But, like Leeds, they have stumbled in their past two matches, losing at home to Fenerbahce and managing only a goalless draw against lowly Erzurumspor. But Europe has been the stage for their most dramatic exploits. In the past Turkish teams have suffered from an inferiority complex when they faced clubs from the major European leagues. But no longer. Victories over Milan, Borussia Dortmund and Real Mallorca have convinced Galatasaray they need fear no one. Their most embarrassing defeat, though, was against English opposition when they lost 5-0 at home to Chelsea in the first phase of the Champions League. \"That was a one-off,\" said Terim, wincing at the memory. \"The Chelsea result will have no effect on the way we approach the Leeds game.\" A quick glance at the team sheet shows the potential Galatasaray have, if they can protect a sometimes suspect defence. Many of Turkey's best players, such as the striker Hakan Sukur, are joined by some well known foreigners: Hagi, his compatriot Gheorghe Popescu, the former Tottenham player, and Brazil's World Cup goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel. Success has come at a price, though, and Galatasaray are reported to be millions of pounds in debt. Terim is among those considering his future if the finances are not sorted out soon, but for the moment the focus is on Europe. At 35, Hagi is slower than he used to be but he is still capable of conjuring spectacular goals. He has a feel for the big occasion and may produce something special tonight. \"We know it will be a difficult game against Leeds,\" he said this week. \"But we have to win. For ourselves and for the fans. This is our moment.\"",

      "body": "<p>Of all their recent decisions on interest rates, this was probably the one which kept the members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee tossing and turning in their beds last night. Which ever way they jumped - upping rates to keep inflation under control as is their mandate from the government, or keeping rates on hold to ease some of the pressure on sterling - they were bound to be come under fire.</p> <p>The Bank has decided - as widely expected - to keep interest rates on stable at 6%. But they will face criticism today for bowing to industry concern about the pound's strength rather than keeping their eye on their main target: the gathering speed of the economy which some analysts fear will spark renewed price pressures.</p> <p>The numbers suggest the Bank has won its battle against inflation. The underlying measure of how fast retail prices are growing has been below the Bank's 2.5% target for nearly a year. Britain now has the lowest inflation rate in the European Union - a remarkable achievement given the UK's history of period of rampant price acceleration.</p> <p>But many economists believe that after recovering from last year's stagnation, the economy is now growing unsustainably fast and that price pressures are bound to re-emerge. </p> <p>Having raised rates four times since last September the Bank has been dismayed to see that there have been few signs of a slowdown. The economy grew by 3% between the last quarter of 1998 and the same point in 1999. </p> <p>Most people would see that as a cause for celebration. But economics is not called the dismal science for nothing. For the nine members of the monetary policy committee, that's a sign that demand is outstripping the economy's capacity to supply goods and services. </p> <p>Luckily for the Bank, the extraordinary rise of sterling against other world currencies has kept price pressures in the domestic economy under control - so far. The pound's strength has made imported goods and raw materials cheaper. But while consumers benefit from lower prices on the high street, manufacturers feel the pinch. It is harder for them to sell their goods overseas because they are more expensive, while at home they face competition from cheap foreign products.</p> <p>This month, the Bank appears to have gone for a wait-and-see approach. Since it last met, a month ago, the pound has remained at its record levels against the euro, while there are some signs in forward looking indicators that some of the fizz may be going out of the economy. House prices, blamed for fuelling a consumer spending spree in the South East, have fallen for the past two months. However, the MPC may be simply postponing the inevitable higher interest rates. Next month they publish their quarterly assessment of the prospects for inflation. If Threadneedle Street's number crunchers believe price pressures are rising, so too will the cost of borrowing.</p>",

The Bank has decided - as widely expected - to keep interest rates on stable at 6%. But they will face criticism today for bowing to industry concern about the pound's strength rather than keeping their eye on their main target: the gathering speed of the economy which some analysts fear will spark renewed price pressures. The numbers suggest the Bank has won its battle against inflation. The underlying measure of how fast retail prices are growing has been below the Bank's 2.5% target for nearly a year. Britain now has the lowest inflation rate in the European Union - a remarkable achievement given the UK's history of period of rampant price acceleration. But many economists believe that after recovering from last year's stagnation, the economy is now growing unsustainably fast and that price pressures are bound to re-emerge. Having raised rates four times since last September the Bank has been dismayed to see that there have been few signs of a slowdown. The economy grew by 3% between the last quarter of 1998 and the same point in 1999. Most people would see that as a cause for celebration. But economics is not called the dismal science for nothing. For the nine members of the monetary policy committee, that's a sign that demand is outstripping the economy's capacity to supply goods and services. Luckily for the Bank, the extraordinary rise of sterling against other world currencies has kept price pressures in the domestic economy under control - so far. The pound's strength has made imported goods and raw materials cheaper. But while consumers benefit from lower prices on the high street, manufacturers feel the pinch. It is harder for them to sell their goods overseas because they are more expensive, while at home they face competition from cheap foreign products. This month, the Bank appears to have gone for a wait-and-see approach. Since it last met, a month ago, the pound has remained at its record levels against the euro, while there are some signs in forward looking indicators that some of the fizz may be going out of the economy. House prices, blamed for fuelling a consumer spending spree in the South East, have fallen for the past two months. However, the MPC may be simply postponing the inevitable higher interest rates. Next month they publish their quarterly assessment of the prospects for inflation. If Threadneedle Street's number crunchers believe price pressures are rising, so too will the cost of borrowing.",

The disclosure of Matthew Barrett's performance pay package is certain to add to the outcry against the bank, which plans to axe 172 of its branches tomorrow. The proposals have triggered unprecedented calls for a boycott of the bank by the environment minister, Chris Mullin. Barclays admits that its shareholders have already attacked the bank's complex share options bonus scheme for senior managers. And Pirc, a pensions and investment research company which advises fund managers on how to invest \u00a3250bn every year, intends to tell its clients to oppose the new bonus payment plan when they are asked for their approval at the bank's annual general meeting later this month. Details of Barclays new bonus scheme were sent out to its shareholders last week. Mr Barrett, whose annual income already exceeds \u00a36m, joined Barclays as chief executive just seven months ago. According to an analysis by Meis, an executive compensation company which conducts research for the National Association of Pension Funds, the terms of the complicated new bonus scheme means that top managers could receive options on shares worth up to 36 times their basic salary each year if they meet all the performance criteria. This suggests that Mr Barrett, who is on a basic salary of \u00a3850,000, could be awarded options which would be worth \u00a330.5m if Barclays meets its own targets. Last night Barclays insisted that the complex terms of a new long-term incentive scheme for senior executives were being \"misrepresented\". Peter Hawker, director of compensation and benefits at the bank, admitted that the intricacy of the plan had prompted questions from leading shareholders, but insisted that Barclays had no plans to rewrite the six page \"incentive share option plan\". Alan MacDougall, managing director of Pirc, said that while he had yet to receive any comments on its recommendation from the bank, parts of the plan did not meet industry standards and in some instances were \"insufficiently\" stretching for top managers. The scheme, which was sent to the bank's shareholders last week, has prompted the Association of British Insurers, the industry lobby group, to raise questions with Barclays about its structure. Michael McKersie, manager of investment affairs at the ABI, while not endorsing the 36 times calculation, said: \"Various points will need to be clarified to reach a full conclusion about the cost of the scheme. \"The potential awards appear high by UK standards and shareholders will want to ensure that the targets are genuinely demanding.\" The terms of the reward scheme are complicated but allow for top executives to be awarded options worth a maximum of twice their salary and bonus. These are then allocated in two potential ways - one based on the \"economic profit\" of the group, the other on the way its shares relate to a peer group of 12. While long-term performance schemes are common among major firms, and recommended by industry watchdogs, Barclays is also proposing to introduce a new way of valuing the options granted to executives - a system most commonly used in the US. Mr Hawker disputed the calculations on a number of grounds, and insisted that it was impossible to value of the options because it would not be possible to know what the bank's share price would be worth in three years time, when the payouts would be calculated. Salary experts say that the complicated new pay scheme, which Mr Barrett said earlier this year would see a \"higher risk of no pay out\", resembled pay deals which are more common in north America, the pay of senior managers is increasingly linked to the performance of the company.",

Even more jobs would go under the cosh of the overvalued pound.\" Mr Monks argued that inflation remained on target and that pay settlements were responsible. \"The chancellor maintained a tight fiscal stance in the budget,\" Mr Monks said. \"To increase rates in reaction to the government's decision to start rebuilding the NHS over five years would be ridiculous, and reflect City prejudice, not economic reality.\" Unions say the strength of the pound has been a key factor in the loss of 400,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 12 months, and the Confederation of British Industry believes there is strong evidence that industry is failing to cope with the strong pound. In an interview with the Guardian, the former chancellor Kenneth Clarke asserted that the bank would be \"mad\" to raise rates, adding that the least its monetary policy committee could do was to leave rates alone. \"They have already raised rates quite a lot and sterling is now becoming a serious medium-term problem.\" Mr Clarke accused both the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the bank's governor, Eddie George, of lacking a strategy to deal with sterling's persistently high levels which are damaging Britain's exports and the balance of payments. \"There is a threat hanging over Dagenham where Ford are at least set to cut production, a threat to Honda at Swindon as well as the [Rover] crisis at Longbridge. But this is only the visible tip of a big iceberg,\" Mr Clarke added. Useful links The Bank of England's MPC The issue explained: Setting Britain's interest rates TUC",

      "body": "<p>It is five years since Glenn Hoddle began a cultural revolution at Chelsea by signing a player known around the world and not just around the World's End pub. </p> <p>Ruud Gullit's arrival began a process of internationalisation at Stamford Bridge which recently saw the club's Italian manager field a side of 11 foreigners. </p> <p>But the Chelsea revolution is not just about collecting different-coloured passports. It is mainly about lifting the club's horizons, about becoming a power in the land and on the continent. </p> <p>So where has this transformation left them? How good are they? Tonight Chelsea face the ultimate progress report. </p> <p>Barcelona are, according to many observers, simply the best team in Europe. The statistics are impressive: unbeaten in the Champions League this season, top scorers with 36 goals in 12 games, victorious in their last nine matches in all competitions.

      "bodyText": "It is five years since Glenn Hoddle began a cultural revolution at Chelsea by signing a player known around the world and not just around the World's End pub. Ruud Gullit's arrival began a process of internationalisation at Stamford Bridge which recently saw the club's Italian manager field a side of 11 foreigners. But the Chelsea revolution is not just about collecting different-coloured passports. It is mainly about lifting the club's horizons, about becoming a power in the land and on the continent. So where has this transformation left them? How good are they? Tonight Chelsea face the ultimate progress report. Barcelona are, according to many observers, simply the best team in Europe. The statistics are impressive: unbeaten in the Champions League this season, top scorers with 36 goals in 12 games, victorious in their last nine matches in all competitions. Barca ooze intimidation. It was enough to move Gianluca Vialli on to the defensive yesterday as he piled on the flattery before tonight's collision. \"Nobody would be too surprised if we lost over the two legs,\" he said. \"Barcelona have the best strikers in the world,\" he added. \"Louis van Gaal is the best manager in the world along with Sir Alex Ferguson and Marcello Lippi.\" When everything clicks for Barcelona's Dutch-dominated team, as in their 4-2 home win against Porto in a group match, they are in a different league from anything Chelsea have yet produced. Despite all the big-match European experience contained within their multinational squad, Chelsea have always needed a helping hand to live with the very best. When every player in blue is truly focused and when the opposition is slightly off colour, Vialli's side have pulled off away draws against Lazio and Milan. But, as Lazio reminded everyone in the return at Stamford Bridge last month, when a team of quality attacks Chelsea with touch and imagination, the Premiership side struggle, gaps open up in defence and the coolest of players are left scrambling to recover position and dignity. \"We will need to be on top of our game and hopefully they will not be.\" Vialli knows the reality. With a three-pronged forward line of Luis Figo, Patrick Kluivert and the world player of the year Rivaldo, now recovered from injury, it is expecting a lot for all of them to be off colour at the same time. As ever, the flow of the game will largely be determined by who dominates midfield, where the battle-hardened Dennis Wise and Pep Guardiola come face to face. It will be little consolation to Chelsea that Barcelona are missing the injured Luis Enrique and Ronald de Boer from midfield because that will only expose the depth of Barcelona's squad. With Celestine Babayaro finally cleared by the Nigerians to play in this tie, Chelsea's main defensive question will be whether Emerson Thome, likely to replace the suspended Frank Leboeuf, can repeat his encouraging Premiership form at this higher level. It all adds up to a crucial five days in Chelsea's season. On Sunday they meet Newcastle in the FA Cup semi-final. By then everyone will know whether that progress report reads more encouragingly than \"must do better\". Possible teams: Chelsea (4-4-2): De Goey; Ferrer, Desailly, Thome, Babayaro; Petrescu, Deschamps, Wise, Poyet; Zola, Flo. Barcelona (4-3-3): Hesp; Reiziger, Abelardo, F de Boer, Bogarde; Gabri, Guardiola, Cocu; Figo, Kluivert, Rivaldo.",

United were grateful that their opponents could no longer come up with one Alfredo. </p> <p>Nevertheless the holders knew that if Real's form, which has flickered all season like a faulty gas ring, did burst into full flame they would be hard pressed to keep them at bay. </p> <p>So United's patient, possessive approach, with no immediate scoring ambition, was understandable. Real, on the other hand, knew they had to up the tempo and disturb the normal calm of Stam and Henning Berg, and in this they succeeded almost from the outset. </p> <p>Quick combinations accompanied by instinctive runs into space saw Raul, Fernando Morientes, McManaman and Savio prise a number of openings to arouse the passions of a stadium well populated but far from full. </p> <p>Berg's well-timed tackle thwarted Raul's attempt to dribble through a thicket of defenders, a cross-shot from Michel Salgado, although it was not going in, was still pushed away by Bosnich and, when McManaman met Savio's dipping cross with a diving header, the United goalkeeper touched the ball over the crossbar. </p> <p>So long as their centre-backs held firm and Roy Keane and Paul Scholes retained a measure of parity in midfield, Manchester United could feel confident about surviving Real's initial attacking burst. And, when United did move forward in any sort of numbers, they soon created chances of their own. </p> <p>The first two, midway through the half, fell to Andy Cole in the space of two minutes. One, from Ryan Giggs's cross after Salgado had slipped, was wafted over the bar. The other, a low shot from 20 yards, was easily saved by the 18-year-old Iker Casillas. </p> <p>Thus an open game promised goals at either end, although by the half-hour the excellence of the goalkeepers had left this promise unfulfilled. </p> <p>After 23 minutes, for example, McManaman and Savio combined to set up Morientes for a point-blank shot which Bosnich kept out with a stretching left hand. Three minutes later David Beckham, taking corners amid a hail of missiles from the crowd, saw one nodded on by Stam at the near post but then headed over by Cole from four yards. </p> <p>As the rain returned, making the surface slippery and testing defenders on the turn, Giggs began to open up the left flank for United while Beckham frequently moved to the middle to increase his range. </p> <p>Yet at half-time Real were entitled to feel more frustrated at having failed to score, after creating the more clear-cut chances. Just past the half-hour McManaman, ever eager to run at defenders, sent Raul clear only for the advancing Bosnich to smother the ball before the Real striker could get in a proper shot. </p> <p>As the half ended Casillas failed to hold a long, low drive from Scholes and Dwight Yorke pounced on the rebound to put the ball into the net. But he was adjudged to have been marginally offside. </p> <p>United's prime task of keeping Real out remained a priority, however, and Bosnich was equal to the low free-kick which Roberto Carlos drove through the United wall in the 47th minute. Now Real's movements in and around the United area began to lose their earlier precision, and a touch of Nicolas Anelka's pace would have served them well at that point. </p> <p>With Giggs rather than Beckham now moving to the middle, Manchester United found opportunites to catch Real on the break the more their opponents pressed forward. In the 64th minute Keane released the Welshman into a thinly defended Real half only for Aitor Karanka to be shown a yellow card for bringing Giggs down at the edge of the area. </p> <p>Real's momentum was flagging, no doubt about that, but United were never going to abandon their tightly organised gameplan. </p> <p> <strong> Real Madrid </strong> (4-3-1-2): Casillas; Salgado, Ivan Campo, Karanke, Roberto Carlos; McManaman, Helguera, Redondo, Savio; Morientes (Ognjenovic, 86), Raul. </p> <p><strong> Manchester United</strong> (4-4-2): Bosnich; G Neville, Berg, Stam, Irwin (Silvestre, 87); Beckham, Keane, Scholes (Butt, 81), Giggs; Cole,Yorke (Sheringham, 76). </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : G Veissiere (France).</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>NEWCASTLE'S SORRY BOARD</strong></p> <p>They've openly mocked their fans for buying over-priced merchandise, tried to force a non-league team to give up home advantage in the FA Cup, forced loyal season ticket holders out of their seats to make room for freeloading business clients and subsequently taken them on in the courts, and called women from their region \"dogs\". But don't you understand? The board of Newcastle United are simply good souls seeking redemption. That's why outgoing chairman Freddie Fletcher has been to confession.</p> <p>\"Issues relating to boardroom changes have adversely impacted on our relations with the City,\" began Fletcher simply, in the first religious act to be held on the front page of a statement to shareholders. \"The disruption relating to the stadium and indeed our own handling of this has severely tested our relationship with our fans,\" he continued, now ready to repent for his sins.</p> <p>\"Undoubtedly mistakes have been made in how we handled the communications of these issues,\" he went on, pleading to be given penance, \"and for this the board apologises unreservedly to all concerned.\" You are absolved, my son! And so, having been credited by the Fiver with a couple of Hail Mary Poppins, Freddie toddled off to find the free wafers and wine.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE FIVER'S PATENTED EXPONENTIAL TALENT-AND-AGE BIRTHDAY CURVE</strong></p> <p>Happy birthday to John Hartson (27), Richard Gough (38) and Sir Tom Finney (78). Just watch that graph shoot off the page.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>LEEDS CHALLENGE LEAGUE'S LEEDS CHALLENGE</strong></p> <p>Yesterday the Fiver reported Leeds' ambitious attempts to extend the definition of a '90-minute journey from Leeds' to include the whole of the north-west of England and north Wales. And all this without inventing a very fast rocket car. In fact all they had to do was invest in Oldham Athletic and, thanks to a loophole in FA rules, the cream of the nation's footballing youth was theirs. Or so they thought.</p> <p>\"The whole issue will need to be examined and we will be contacting Leeds and Oldham,\" said Football League spokesman John Nagle last night, fighting back for the rights of the small club. \"The League's board are set to meet in the next 10-12 days and the matter will be discussed then,\" he went on. \"We have not given our consent and if necessary have the power to prevent it happening.\" Which gave the League the upper hand in any argument. Or so they thought.</p> <p>\"If this was stopped from going through the only people who would lose out would be Oldham,\" retorted busy Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale this afternoon at the same time as launching a new Leeds hair gel and releasing a white paper on European competition policy. \"We could set up a centre of excellence right on their doorstep instead,\" he continued. \"Is that what the Football League really wants?\" Probably not, and it wouldn't help the parking problem outside Boundary Park either.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I don't think there is any point dwelling on it. I missed a good chance, but I'm not going to go home and top myself over it\" - Who mentioned topping yourself? Andy Cole after heading over from 1.11 inches last night.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>MALTEASEY DOES IT</strong></p> <p>The Fiver knows more than most about the majestic Mediterranean isle of Malta - it's the home of the Malteser, the birthplace of Napoleon, and a lovely place for a holiday (Paphos is particularly nice this time of year, apparently). But we've never heard about the country lacking a sense of humour of Graham-esque proportions. Not until now, anyway.</p> <p>Earlier today, cuddly multinational McDonald's were forced to apologise to Maltese footballers for poking fun at their ability in a TV ad (not unreasonably, considering the Malts have never reached a major championship). A Dutch commercial showed actors dressed as the Maltese national team taking part in a McDonald's competition for Euro 2000 tickets. It has been assumed by Dutch comic analysts that the punchline was: this is the only way Malta could ever make it to the finals.</p> <p>The advert caused such a storm of protest that the global giant (McDonald's, not Malta) was forced to back down. \"It is never our intention to offend anyone.

      "bodyText": "NEWCASTLE'S SORRY BOARD They've openly mocked their fans for buying over-priced merchandise, tried to force a non-league team to give up home advantage in the FA Cup, forced loyal season ticket holders out of their seats to make room for freeloading business clients and subsequently taken them on in the courts, and called women from their region \"dogs\". But don't you understand? The board of Newcastle United are simply good souls seeking redemption. That's why outgoing chairman Freddie Fletcher has been to confession. \"Issues relating to boardroom changes have adversely impacted on our relations with the City,\" began Fletcher simply, in the first religious act to be held on the front page of a statement to shareholders. \"The disruption relating to the stadium and indeed our own handling of this has severely tested our relationship with our fans,\" he continued, now ready to repent for his sins. \"Undoubtedly mistakes have been made in how we handled the communications of these issues,\" he went on, pleading to be given penance, \"and for this the board apologises unreservedly to all concerned.\" You are absolved, my son! And so, having been credited by the Fiver with a couple of Hail Mary Poppins, Freddie toddled off to find the free wafers and wine. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE FIVER'S PATENTED EXPONENTIAL TALENT-AND-AGE BIRTHDAY CURVE Happy birthday to John Hartson (27), Richard Gough (38) and Sir Tom Finney (78). Just watch that graph shoot off the page. * * * * * * * * * * * * * LEEDS CHALLENGE LEAGUE'S LEEDS CHALLENGE Yesterday the Fiver reported Leeds' ambitious attempts to extend the definition of a '90-minute journey from Leeds' to include the whole of the north-west of England and north Wales. And all this without inventing a very fast rocket car. In fact all they had to do was invest in Oldham Athletic and, thanks to a loophole in FA rules, the cream of the nation's footballing youth was theirs. Or so they thought. \"The whole issue will need to be examined and we will be contacting Leeds and Oldham,\" said Football League spokesman John Nagle last night, fighting back for the rights of the small club. \"The League's board are set to meet in the next 10-12 days and the matter will be discussed then,\" he went on. \"We have not given our consent and if necessary have the power to prevent it happening.\" Which gave the League the upper hand in any argument. Or so they thought. \"If this was stopped from going through the only people who would lose out would be Oldham,\" retorted busy Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale this afternoon at the same time as launching a new Leeds hair gel and releasing a white paper on European competition policy. \"We could set up a centre of excellence right on their doorstep instead,\" he continued. \"Is that what the Football League really wants?\" Probably not, and it wouldn't help the parking problem outside Boundary Park either. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I don't think there is any point dwelling on it. I missed a good chance, but I'm not going to go home and top myself over it\" - Who mentioned topping yourself? Andy Cole after heading over from 1.11 inches last night. * * * * * * * * * * * * * MALTEASEY DOES IT The Fiver knows more than most about the majestic Mediterranean isle of Malta - it's the home of the Malteser, the birthplace of Napoleon, and a lovely place for a holiday (Paphos is particularly nice this time of year, apparently). But we've never heard about the country lacking a sense of humour of Graham-esque proportions. Not until now, anyway. Earlier today, cuddly multinational McDonald's were forced to apologise to Maltese footballers for poking fun at their ability in a TV ad (not unreasonably, considering the Malts have never reached a major championship). A Dutch commercial showed actors dressed as the Maltese national team taking part in a McDonald's competition for Euro 2000 tickets. It has been assumed by Dutch comic analysts that the punchline was: this is the only way Malta could ever make it to the finals. The advert caused such a storm of protest that the global giant (McDonald's, not Malta) was forced to back down. \"It is never our intention to offend anyone. We have apologised by letter to the Maltese Football Association,\" said a spokeswoman for McDonalds Netherlands. She didn't, however, explain why they eat chips with mayonnaise. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Middlesbrough's Christian Ziege has denied he will be joining Liverpool for \u00a38m this summer. Recent reports suggested that Ziege could be set to follow fellow German international Dietmar Hamann from the North East to Merseyside, but he said today: \"It's not true that I want to leave to go to Liverpool or anywhere else, I'm happy at Middlesbrough.\" Gianluca Vialli has been tipped to move for three Internazionale players this summer. \u00a310m striker Nicola Ventola, club captain Javier Zanetti (also valued at \u00a310m) and \u00a37m-rated goalkeeper Sebastien Frey are his mooted targets. Rio Ferdinand, who this morning expressed his dissatisfaction at West Ham's failure to challenge for trophies, is wanted by AC Milan and is likely to be approached by the club this summer. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Norwich have appointed Bryan Hamilton as manager on a permanent basis. Hamilton had been acting as caretaker boss since the resignation of Bruce Rioch last month. \"I can use the remaining games of the season to start to build for the next campaign... the Board and I are ambitious,\" said the 54-year-old former Northern Ireland manager. Lazio's Argentinian midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron is under investigation by Italian justice officials regarding his Italian citizenship which allows him to play for the Rome club as an EU player. Blackburn are to provide free travel to their match at Grimsby on April 22 for around 1,000 fans. The club will lay on up to 20 coaches. \"The gesture is a mark of appreciation aimed at those who regularly travel the length and breadth of the country to support the team,\" said chief executive John Williams. Nicolas Anelka resumed full training with Real Madrid today after serving 22 days of a 45-day suspension for missing three days of training.

      "body": "<p>The selection of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year has always been the perquisite of the Almanack's editor of the day. Perhaps he gets a little help from his friends. But the process has always been rather secretive, even mystical, and the choice personal, sometimes downright eccentric. </p> <p> The system works and, over the years, has come up with more interesting and less predictable names than a committee might have done. But once the decision was taken for Wisden to choose Five Cricketers of the 20th Century, it seemed inadequate. There was a precedent. When the centenary Almanack was published in 1963, Sir Neville Cardus was asked to name \"Six [not, interestingly, five] Giants of the Wisden Century.\" He went for Sydney Barnes, Sir Donald Bradman, W. G. Grace, Sir Jack Hobbs, Tom Richardson and Victor Trumper.</p> <p> But the cricketing 20th century was a much more global one than Wisden's first century. No list to cover the years 1900 to 1999 could reasonably include only white males: four Englishman and two Australians. And no one person's perception could properly cover the entire sweep of the game as it is now played. So it seemed right that, for the age of democracy, the choice should be made differently.</p> <p> To reflect the pattern of cricket history, we established an electorate of 100, from all nine Test-playing countries but weighted to reflect each country's role in international cricket over the century, judged - very roughly - on the number of Tests played. So there were 28 English voters, 20 from Australia and so on down the line to just one from Zimbabwe. </p> <p> The electorate comprised 97 men and three women (the doyenne of English women's cricket, Netta Rheinberg, the Pakistani journalist Fareshteh Gati and the Barbadian commentator Donna Symmonds). They were a mixture of cricketers, journalists (indeed many count as both), historians or even just expert observers of the game like Sir Carlisle Burton of Barbados. More than half had played Test cricket; all of them had watched copious amounts of it. There were many people whose broad knowledge and expertise would have added further lustre but who could not be squeezed in; to all of them my apologies.</p> <p> Those who were asked faced a task that was essentially impossible. The major problem with this exercise is, of course, that no one watched all the cricket of the century. Some, however, came close, led by E. W. Swanton, whose first-hand knowledge of all cricket since the First World War was unsurpassable. We were fortunate that he was able to take part before he died in January 2000. We were also privileged to have three electors who played Test matches before the Second World War: Norman Gordon, Alf Gover and Lindsay Weir. It would be wrong, though, to have had this decision entirely filtered through the perhaps rheumy eyes of age. The current generation of cricketers, not all of whom have much feel for the game's history, was represented by the Australian captain Steve Waugh, who does.</p> <p> To avoid embarrassment, it was decided not to ask any of the most obvious candidates for the accolade to be voters themselves, even though this meant losing, most obviously, the unparalleled judgment of Sir Donald Bradman. Even so, there was some overlap, and half a dozen of those asked to cast votes also received them. No one voted for himself, though there was one near-miss, which we will come to. </p> <p> During the World Cup and just afterwards, the 100 voters were asked \"to set aside any bias towards your own country and your own era, and name the five whose excellence at cricket during the 20th century you think has made the greatest contribution to the game\". </p> <p> They were told not to put the players in any order of merit, just to name the five, and given only two pieces of advice. One was a general point that has always driven the selection of Cricketers of the Year. \"Excellence can be interpreted broadly,\" we said. \"It is legitimate to take into account leadership qualities, personality, character and impact on the public.\" The second was more specific: \"Please don't vote for W. G. Grace. We consider him a Cricketer of the 19th Century.\" They were given the option of explaining their choices if they wanted; some of the most telling remarks are quoted below.</p> <p> There were no problems with the guidelines. A few (mostly journalists, of course) had problems with the deadlines. The terror on my part was that there might be a tie for fifth place, forcing us to find some kind of tiebreak mechanism. But it was not a problem: the final verdict was unexpectedly decisive, and there was a substantial gap between fifth and sixth. </p> <p> It was not, of course, as great as the gap between second and third. The endorsement of Bradman was every bit as ringing as expected (I did wonder if someone, somewhere, might be contrarian, but no one dared). Steve Waugh summed up the consensus as eloquently as anyone: \"Sir Donald really speaks for himself.\" \"Only one Don,\" said Alan Davidson. No one can doubt, no one does doubt, that here was the greatest cricketer of the 20th century.</p> <p> But Sir Garfield Sobers was not far behind. He was on 90 of the 100 ballot papers and those who left him out must have wrestled with their consciences first. \"If there's been a better all-rounder,\" as Dickie Bird put it, \"I'd love to have seen him play.\" Thus the overwhelming majority of those who voted felt, frustratingly, that they did not really have five votes but three - because the top two were certainties.</p> <p> Indeed, many felt the same applied to Sir Jack Hobbs. But here there was a complication. Most people wanted to include someone to represent the pinnacle of English batsmanship, and there were alternatives. Walter Hammond's statistics are overwhelming. Then consider \"impact on the public\"; on that basis it is hard to argue against Denis Compton. And what about Sir Leonard? Many exceptional judges did not vote for Hobbs. John Woodcock chose Compton \"for enchantment\". Swanton made the case for Frank Woolley: \"He scored more runs than anyone bar Hobbs and scored at around 50 an hour, giving more pleasure and for longer than any other English cricketer.\" And he took 2,000 wickets and 1,000 catches. </p> <p> Enough, however, opted for Hobbs's quiet but devastating impact on the game. \"He challenged the key assumption that no professional could bat as well as a thoroughbred amateur,\" said Gideon Haigh, editor of Wisden Australia. And he was, as our long-standing Sri Lankan correspondent Gerry Vaidyasekera put it, \"a batsman with a charming smile and a kind heart\".</p> <p> Perhaps the biggest surprise is the identity of the player in fourth place. There were people among our hundred frightened to make a judgment on players they had not seen, which might have given present-day players an advantage. With perfect knowledge, maybe there would have been more votes for some of the early players, for Barnes, say, or Victor Trumper. But there are always former players who scorn the moderns, and perhaps an equal number of ballot papers reflected this factor. In any case, the votes for Shane Warne came from across the globe and across the generations. If anyone doubts his status, listen to Crawford White, 88 last year and the former cricket correspondent of the Daily Express, who watched both Warne and Bill O'Reilly. \"O'Reilly didn't rip the ball through like Warne does,\" said White. \"And I don't think he caught the imagination quite as much as this lad.\" </p> <p> The fifth selection turned out to be a third specialist batsman, Viv Richards, \"a master of both versions of the game,\" in the words of the Pakistani journalist Omar Kureishi. No one better epitomises the ferocious nature of cricket in the 1970s and 1980s - except perhaps Dennis Lillee. No specialist fast bowler made the final cut, arguably the one flaw in our selection. But Lillee was by far the nearest, with a particularly high poll from those who saw him at closest quarters - \"To me, the greatest fast bowler in history,\" said Dickie Bird - as well as votes from such luminaries as Sir Everton Weekes and Peter Pollock. </p> <p> Others preferred Harold Larwood or Ray Lindwall (\"the greatest quickie of all in pace, control and movement\" - Tom Graveney). In the end, Lillee was not even outright sixth, but finished equal with Sir Frank Worrell, whose position perhaps bore testament to the concept of interpreting excellence broadly, and the near-reverence in which he is still held as a leader whose impact resounded far beyond cricket. \"A great man,\" said Richie Benaud, his most worthy opponent, putting Worrell in his five.</p> <p> Some voters - quite legitimately - used at least one of their picks to include their personal heroes. Fred Trueman chose Wilfred Rhodes; one South African sheet anchor, Russell Endean, voted for another, Bruce Mitchell; Bob Taylor struck a blow for wicket-keepers, not easy to do in a list of just five, by choosing Godfrey Evans. </p> <p> Others honoured their contemporaries. Vic Marks had the chance to name two of his Somerset team-mates - Richards and Ian Botham - and took it, though he resisted including Peter Denning, Peter Roebuck and Colin Dredge as well. Peter van der Merwe, the former South African captain, picked out Colin Bland: \"He revolutionised the attitude to fielding, and set a standard not yet equalled.\" Alf Gover named Maurice Tate. Brian Close went for Trueman. </p> <p> But there were also some touching, and unexpected, tributes across the generations. The great New Zealand batsman John Reid voted for Malcolm Marshall, before Marshall's tragically early death: \"He seems to have had everything: pace, movement, accuracy, and the right attitude, which is hard to say of some other fast bowlers.\" Ian Chappell, that bonny fighter for cricketers' rights, went for Barnes: \"Statistically a great bowler and stamped his character on the game by demanding that he always be paid his worth.\" Jonathan Agnew went for A. P. Freeman: \"His statistics blow my mind whenever I read them.\" </p> <p> One member of the panel, however, went very close to home indeed. Walter Hadlee confronted the issue squarely as he cast his ballot for his son, Sir Richard. \"This has to be embarrassing for me,\" he wrote. \"But there's a job to be done. I will cite the bare facts.\" And he did: 431 Test wickets and the transformation of New Zealand's Test record. \"I consider him to be marginally ahead of Dennis Lillee,\" he concluded. And a dozen other people - all unrelated - came to a similar conclusion.</p> <p> Not one of our hundred voted for all the final five. Yet I don't believe anyone will argue that we have got it terribly wrong. At least one of the five played in every decade of the century. We have two Australians, two West Indians and an Englishman, which seems geographically right (though one suspects an Asian or three will be up there for the 21st century). A total of 49 players received at least one vote. And the difficulty of the choice can be gauged by the quality of some of those who failed to get on the scoresheet at all: Keith Miller (who received many mentions in despatches), Barry Richards, Greg Chappell, Gooch, Laker, Lara, Hanif, C. B. Fry...</p> <p> It was enormous fun just counting the votes; I think almost everyone enjoyed the exquisite torment of making a decision. If there is a sadness, it is only that none of us can expect to be around to have a second bite in 2100.

      "bodyText": "The selection of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year has always been the perquisite of the Almanack's editor of the day. Perhaps he gets a little help from his friends. But the process has always been rather secretive, even mystical, and the choice personal, sometimes downright eccentric. The system works and, over the years, has come up with more interesting and less predictable names than a committee might have done. But once the decision was taken for Wisden to choose Five Cricketers of the 20th Century, it seemed inadequate. There was a precedent. When the centenary Almanack was published in 1963, Sir Neville Cardus was asked to name \"Six [not, interestingly, five] Giants of the Wisden Century.\" He went for Sydney Barnes, Sir Donald Bradman, W. G. Grace, Sir Jack Hobbs, Tom Richardson and Victor Trumper. But the cricketing 20th century was a much more global one than Wisden's first century. No list to cover the years 1900 to 1999 could reasonably include only white males: four Englishman and two Australians. And no one person's perception could properly cover the entire sweep of the game as it is now played. So it seemed right that, for the age of democracy, the choice should be made differently. To reflect the pattern of cricket history, we established an electorate of 100, from all nine Test-playing countries but weighted to reflect each country's role in international cricket over the century, judged - very roughly - on the number of Tests played. So there were 28 English voters, 20 from Australia and so on down the line to just one from Zimbabwe. The electorate comprised 97 men and three women (the doyenne of English women's cricket, Netta Rheinberg, the Pakistani journalist Fareshteh Gati and the Barbadian commentator Donna Symmonds). They were a mixture of cricketers, journalists (indeed many count as both), historians or even just expert observers of the game like Sir Carlisle Burton of Barbados. More than half had played Test cricket; all of them had watched copious amounts of it. There were many people whose broad knowledge and expertise would have added further lustre but who could not be squeezed in; to all of them my apologies. Those who were asked faced a task that was essentially impossible. The major problem with this exercise is, of course, that no one watched all the cricket of the century. Some, however, came close, led by E. W. Swanton, whose first-hand knowledge of all cricket since the First World War was unsurpassable. We were fortunate that he was able to take part before he died in January 2000. We were also privileged to have three electors who played Test matches before the Second World War: Norman Gordon, Alf Gover and Lindsay Weir. It would be wrong, though, to have had this decision entirely filtered through the perhaps rheumy eyes of age. The current generation of cricketers, not all of whom have much feel for the game's history, was represented by the Australian captain Steve Waugh, who does. To avoid embarrassment, it was decided not to ask any of the most obvious candidates for the accolade to be voters themselves, even though this meant losing, most obviously, the unparalleled judgment of Sir Donald Bradman. Even so, there was some overlap, and half a dozen of those asked to cast votes also received them. No one voted for himself, though there was one near-miss, which we will come to. During the World Cup and just afterwards, the 100 voters were asked \"to set aside any bias towards your own country and your own era, and name the five whose excellence at cricket during the 20th century you think has made the greatest contribution to the game\". They were told not to put the players in any order of merit, just to name the five, and given only two pieces of advice. One was a general point that has always driven the selection of Cricketers of the Year. \"Excellence can be interpreted broadly,\" we said. \"It is legitimate to take into account leadership qualities, personality, character and impact on the public.\" The second was more specific: \"Please don't vote for W. G. Grace. We consider him a Cricketer of the 19th Century.\" They were given the option of explaining their choices if they wanted; some of the most telling remarks are quoted below. There were no problems with the guidelines. A few (mostly journalists, of course) had problems with the deadlines. The terror on my part was that there might be a tie for fifth place, forcing us to find some kind of tiebreak mechanism. But it was not a problem: the final verdict was unexpectedly decisive, and there was a substantial gap between fifth and sixth. It was not, of course, as great as the gap between second and third. The endorsement of Bradman was every bit as ringing as expected (I did wonder if someone, somewhere, might be contrarian, but no one dared). Steve Waugh summed up the consensus as eloquently as anyone: \"Sir Donald really speaks for himself.\" \"Only one Don,\" said Alan Davidson. No one can doubt, no one does doubt, that here was the greatest cricketer of the 20th century. But Sir Garfield Sobers was not far behind. He was on 90 of the 100 ballot papers and those who left him out must have wrestled with their consciences first. \"If there's been a better all-rounder,\" as Dickie Bird put it, \"I'd love to have seen him play.\" Thus the overwhelming majority of those who voted felt, frustratingly, that they did not really have five votes but three - because the top two were certainties. Indeed, many felt the same applied to Sir Jack Hobbs. But here there was a complication. Most people wanted to include someone to represent the pinnacle of English batsmanship, and there were alternatives. Walter Hammond's statistics are overwhelming. Then consider \"impact on the public\"; on that basis it is hard to argue against Denis Compton. And what about Sir Leonard? Many exceptional judges did not vote for Hobbs. John Woodcock chose Compton \"for enchantment\". Swanton made the case for Frank Woolley: \"He scored more runs than anyone bar Hobbs and scored at around 50 an hour, giving more pleasure and for longer than any other English cricketer.\" And he took 2,000 wickets and 1,000 catches. Enough, however, opted for Hobbs's quiet but devastating impact on the game. \"He challenged the key assumption that no professional could bat as well as a thoroughbred amateur,\" said Gideon Haigh, editor of Wisden Australia. And he was, as our long-standing Sri Lankan correspondent Gerry Vaidyasekera put it, \"a batsman with a charming smile and a kind heart\". Perhaps the biggest surprise is the identity of the player in fourth place. There were people among our hundred frightened to make a judgment on players they had not seen, which might have given present-day players an advantage. With perfect knowledge, maybe there would have been more votes for some of the early players, for Barnes, say, or Victor Trumper. But there are always former players who scorn the moderns, and perhaps an equal number of ballot papers reflected this factor. In any case, the votes for Shane Warne came from across the globe and across the generations. If anyone doubts his status, listen to Crawford White, 88 last year and the former cricket correspondent of the Daily Express, who watched both Warne and Bill O'Reilly. \"O'Reilly didn't rip the ball through like Warne does,\" said White. \"And I don't think he caught the imagination quite as much as this lad.\" The fifth selection turned out to be a third specialist batsman, Viv Richards, \"a master of both versions of the game,\" in the words of the Pakistani journalist Omar Kureishi. No one better epitomises the ferocious nature of cricket in the 1970s and 1980s - except perhaps Dennis Lillee. No specialist fast bowler made the final cut, arguably the one flaw in our selection. But Lillee was by far the nearest, with a particularly high poll from those who saw him at closest quarters - \"To me, the greatest fast bowler in history,\" said Dickie Bird - as well as votes from such luminaries as Sir Everton Weekes and Peter Pollock. Others preferred Harold Larwood or Ray Lindwall (\"the greatest quickie of all in pace, control and movement\" - Tom Graveney). In the end, Lillee was not even outright sixth, but finished equal with Sir Frank Worrell, whose position perhaps bore testament to the concept of interpreting excellence broadly, and the near-reverence in which he is still held as a leader whose impact resounded far beyond cricket. \"A great man,\" said Richie Benaud, his most worthy opponent, putting Worrell in his five. Some voters - quite legitimately - used at least one of their picks to include their personal heroes. Fred Trueman chose Wilfred Rhodes; one South African sheet anchor, Russell Endean, voted for another, Bruce Mitchell; Bob Taylor struck a blow for wicket-keepers, not easy to do in a list of just five, by choosing Godfrey Evans. Others honoured their contemporaries. Vic Marks had the chance to name two of his Somerset team-mates - Richards and Ian Botham - and took it, though he resisted including Peter Denning, Peter Roebuck and Colin Dredge as well. Peter van der Merwe, the former South African captain, picked out Colin Bland: \"He revolutionised the attitude to fielding, and set a standard not yet equalled.\" Alf Gover named Maurice Tate. Brian Close went for Trueman. But there were also some touching, and unexpected, tributes across the generations. The great New Zealand batsman John Reid voted for Malcolm Marshall, before Marshall's tragically early death: \"He seems to have had everything: pace, movement, accuracy, and the right attitude, which is hard to say of some other fast bowlers.\" Ian Chappell, that bonny fighter for cricketers' rights, went for Barnes: \"Statistically a great bowler and stamped his character on the game by demanding that he always be paid his worth.\" Jonathan Agnew went for A. P. Freeman: \"His statistics blow my mind whenever I read them.\" One member of the panel, however, went very close to home indeed. Walter Hadlee confronted the issue squarely as he cast his ballot for his son, Sir Richard. \"This has to be embarrassing for me,\" he wrote. \"But there's a job to be done. I will cite the bare facts.\" And he did: 431 Test wickets and the transformation of New Zealand's Test record. \"I consider him to be marginally ahead of Dennis Lillee,\" he concluded. And a dozen other people - all unrelated - came to a similar conclusion. Not one of our hundred voted for all the final five. Yet I don't believe anyone will argue that we have got it terribly wrong. At least one of the five played in every decade of the century. We have two Australians, two West Indians and an Englishman, which seems geographically right (though one suspects an Asian or three will be up there for the 21st century). A total of 49 players received at least one vote. And the difficulty of the choice can be gauged by the quality of some of those who failed to get on the scoresheet at all: Keith Miller (who received many mentions in despatches), Barry Richards, Greg Chappell, Gooch, Laker, Lara, Hanif, C. B. Fry... It was enormous fun just counting the votes; I think almost everyone enjoyed the exquisite torment of making a decision. If there is a sadness, it is only that none of us can expect to be around to have a second bite in 2100. But I hope our successors will make the attempt, and (with more video to guide them) will have just as many great cricketers from whom to choose. In choosing and contacting the electorate, I was given special help by Mike Coward, Colin Bryden, Tony Cozier, R. Mohan, Qamar Ahmed and Don Cameron. To these, and everyone else who took part, I would like to express my gratitude. Matthew Engel is editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack The list of voters... ...and the votes in full",

That place is the Isle of Wight. </p> <p>Desperately short of land to create dumps, and needing to dispose of 138,000 tonnes a year of rubbish, the island's county council has been forced to take drastic action. </p> <p>It has a \u00a340m deal under which 41% of domestic rubbish is being recycled -compared to an average 7.8% in the rest of Britain. </p> <p>Island Waste, a subsidiary of Biffa, the waste company arm of Severn Trent Water, has re-equipped the council's dustcarts to separate kitchen waste, and is rebuilding an \"energy from waste\" power station (which will supply the national grid) so it can be fuelled by waste pellets processed at a refuse collection plant next door, one that also removes and recycles aluminium cans. </p> <p>The most striking investment is \u00a32.2m to build the UK's largest composting plant, a Canadian made machine that turns waste into compost within 14 days and can process 15,000 tonnes a year -more than can be used on the island at the moment. </p> <p>The plant is responsible for a boom in organic farming. This year one of the island's biggest tomato growers intends to use the compost to grow his entire crop. The council also sells compost to gardeners and puts the rest on its parks and gardens. </p> <p>This month the council closed one of its landfill sites, and within 15 to 20 years landfill will stop altogether.

      "bodyText": "There is one place in Britain where the government's green tax is working as it should do - providing a huge increase in recycling along with investment in worthwhile environmental projects. That place is the Isle of Wight. Desperately short of land to create dumps, and needing to dispose of 138,000 tonnes a year of rubbish, the island's county council has been forced to take drastic action. It has a \u00a340m deal under which 41% of domestic rubbish is being recycled -compared to an average 7.8% in the rest of Britain. Island Waste, a subsidiary of Biffa, the waste company arm of Severn Trent Water, has re-equipped the council's dustcarts to separate kitchen waste, and is rebuilding an \"energy from waste\" power station (which will supply the national grid) so it can be fuelled by waste pellets processed at a refuse collection plant next door, one that also removes and recycles aluminium cans. The most striking investment is \u00a32.2m to build the UK's largest composting plant, a Canadian made machine that turns waste into compost within 14 days and can process 15,000 tonnes a year -more than can be used on the island at the moment. The plant is responsible for a boom in organic farming. This year one of the island's biggest tomato growers intends to use the compost to grow his entire crop. The council also sells compost to gardeners and puts the rest on its parks and gardens. This month the council closed one of its landfill sites, and within 15 to 20 years landfill will stop altogether. Any material that cannot be recycled will then have to be shipped to the mainland - making it very expensive. Bruce Gilmore, general manager of Island Waste, is predicting that by next year more than 50% of rubbish will be recycled. \"We shall be expanding our doorstep collection, which already covers newspapers, to include three types of glass and possibly textiles,\" he promised. The company is also trying to change attitudes to recycling by talking to schools and by targeting pensioners, the group most resistant to change. Unlike some other schemes, distribution of landfill tax credits is given to a national body, the Royal Society for Nature Conservation, that has no connection with the waste industry. The main beneficiary on the Isle of Wight will be Ventnor botanic garden, which will get a visitors centre paid for by \u00a3600,000 from landfill tax and \u00a3830,000 from the Millennium Commission. Another beneficiary will be the red squirrel, which will get new tree corridors. The one flaw is that the firm monitoring Biffa's success in re-cycling is funded by landfill tax credits from the scheme - and, because of the way the landfill regulations are drawn up, the credits originally come from Biffa; but there is no other way to fund monitoring of the scheme. What a waste \u0095The UK produces 27m tonnes of municipal waste each year \u00952.2m tonnes of newsprint are recycled every year \u0095Every day approximately 80m food cartons and drinks cans end up in landfill \u0095Over 9m disposable nappies are used in Britain every day, for 4% of waste \u0095Last year 20m plastic bottles were recycled in the UK \u0095There are 22,000 bottle banks in the UK; 27% of all glass waste is recycled",

But Mr Wilson, a devoted royalist, and Roy Jenkins, the chancellor of the exchequer, were reluctant to grant an increase before that date as they wanted to avoid a rumpus before the general election. Mr Jenkins suggested that the Queen could dip into her private fortune to meet any shortfall until the next batch of funding from the public coffers was agreed, according to documents in the public record office. Alternatively, \"perhaps the royal family's bankers could be asked to help with a loan\", he pointed out in a minute to Mr Wilson in May, 1968. Mr Jenkins noted that some members of the royal family were \"finding it increasingly difficult to manage\" on their allowances. Mr Wilson was worried that courtiers from the royal household would be subjected to \"hostile\" questioning from a select committee of MPs, especially since his government was straining to control the rise in people's wages and the cost of goods in the shops through a prices and incomes policy. At a secret meeting with Mr Jenkins in July 1968, Mr Wilson said: \"The palace would probably recognise that it was desirable, in the interests of avoiding controversy, that nothing should be done about a new civil list during the lifetime of this parliament.\" He was concerned that a furore about the royal finances would be stirred up in 1969 when Prince Charles became the Prince of Wales.

      "body": "<p>Just 24 hours after Wall Street experienced its most volatile session in history, initial gains were soon wiped out by further slumps, while in London the market was paralysed for almost eight hours thanks to a technical glitch. </p> <p>Shares opened slightly higher in New York in nervous trading, but early gains soon faded with the Dow Jones industrial average declining 17.06 to 11,147.78, erasing a 53-point gain. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 1.08 to 1493.65, and the Nasdaq index, home to many high-tech companies, lost 1.45 to 4147.44, after being up 50. </p> <p>Today's opening followed a shaky Tuesday, when the Nasdaq and Dow each plummeted more than 500 points. A semblance of calm returned at the end of yesterday's trading as buyers returned in search of bargains, and most stocks ended the chaotic session with only moderate losses. Goldman Sachs' influential analyst Abby Cohen provided some footing for the US markets as she reiterated her confidence in the outlook for the US market. The \"new/old economy\" divide continued to dominate trading, with \"new economy\" stocks were back in favour as investors took heart from Nasdaq's dramatic recovery overnight.</p> <p>In London, trading on one of the most important days of the financial year finally kicked off at 3.30pm, just an hour before the market was due to close, after the Stock Exchange was paralysed by a computer glitch from 8am. The Stock Exchange announced it was extending trading until 6.30pm to help make up for the failure which hit the markets on one of the busiest days for private investors - the last day of the tax year. At 3.58 pm, the FTSE 100 index was trading 111.7 points lower at 6,310.4, its low of the day so far. Volume was 120m shares in 21,879 transactions. </p> <p>The inability to trade this morning left brokers frustrated and angry, particularly after the wild swings in New York overnight and sharp falls on the European bourses in trading today. Those most affected by today's breakdown - the second on the exchange in less than a week, and the worst in its history - were the retail investors, who are particularly active at the end of the tax year. </p> <p>Today's problem was caused by a fault in the electronic feed that sends prices from the Exchange to dealers screens. Mark Dampier, of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"It's been a very bad advertisement for the City of London. This is not going to make us look good on the world stage.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's ructions on Wall Street spilled on to European markets as Frankfurt, Milan and Paris all tumbled. In afternoon trading Frankfurt was down 2.82%, Milan was off 2.70% and Paris was down 2.83%</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just 24 hours after Wall Street experienced its most volatile session in history, initial gains were soon wiped out by further slumps, while in London the market was paralysed for almost eight hours thanks to a technical glitch. Shares opened slightly higher in New York in nervous trading, but early gains soon faded with the Dow Jones industrial average declining 17.06 to 11,147.78, erasing a 53-point gain. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 1.08 to 1493.65, and the Nasdaq index, home to many high-tech companies, lost 1.45 to 4147.44, after being up 50. Today's opening followed a shaky Tuesday, when the Nasdaq and Dow each plummeted more than 500 points. A semblance of calm returned at the end of yesterday's trading as buyers returned in search of bargains, and most stocks ended the chaotic session with only moderate losses. Goldman Sachs' influential analyst Abby Cohen provided some footing for the US markets as she reiterated her confidence in the outlook for the US market. The \"new/old economy\" divide continued to dominate trading, with \"new economy\" stocks were back in favour as investors took heart from Nasdaq's dramatic recovery overnight. In London, trading on one of the most important days of the financial year finally kicked off at 3.30pm, just an hour before the market was due to close, after the Stock Exchange was paralysed by a computer glitch from 8am. The Stock Exchange announced it was extending trading until 6.30pm to help make up for the failure which hit the markets on one of the busiest days for private investors - the last day of the tax year. At 3.58 pm, the FTSE 100 index was trading 111.7 points lower at 6,310.4, its low of the day so far. Volume was 120m shares in 21,879 transactions. The inability to trade this morning left brokers frustrated and angry, particularly after the wild swings in New York overnight and sharp falls on the European bourses in trading today. Those most affected by today's breakdown - the second on the exchange in less than a week, and the worst in its history - were the retail investors, who are particularly active at the end of the tax year. Today's problem was caused by a fault in the electronic feed that sends prices from the Exchange to dealers screens. Mark Dampier, of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"It's been a very bad advertisement for the City of London. This is not going to make us look good on the world stage.\" Yesterday's ructions on Wall Street spilled on to European markets as Frankfurt, Milan and Paris all tumbled. In afternoon trading Frankfurt was down 2.82%, Milan was off 2.70% and Paris was down 2.83%",

I will never forget opening my eyes to see her standing over me, crying and shivering, her hand on my shoulder to wake me gently as she whispered: \"Mum, I've been raped.\" As I woke my husband, Emma's stepfather, and my son, to tell them what had happened, we began to realise that life would never be the same again for Emma, or indeed for any of us. </p> <p>What happened to my daughter devastated our family - it also affected close friends and even colleagues. I remember particularly the reactions of the men. On the morning after it happened, my husband took my son, then 13 and stunned into an angry yet slightly bewildered silence, to a football match while we dealt with the immediate post-rape formalities. His eyes still fill with tears as he remembers sitting next to my son at the match with everyone around them cheering and singing, not knowing what to say or do, and trying not to let my son see that he was crying. </p> <p>My sister's husband raged. He wanted to know exactly what was being done to catch the rapist and had clear ideas on what should be done with him (and to him) if and when he was caught. My male boss and colleagues wept and then they too talked of revenge, death and castration. They were no more angry or distressed than the women, but they felt ashamed to be male, and guilty on behalf of mankind. </p> <p>They didn't know how to approach my daughter, or even how to be in the same room with her. Would she trust them, or would she now always fear men? They didn't know how they should be around her and were too uncomfortable and embarrassed to ask. </p> <p>Perhaps the most difficult family member to tell was my mother. The relationship between a grandparent and grandchild is an uncomplicated one, where each seeks to protect the other from the harshness of life, where a teenager or young adult can slip back into childhood and where granny can spoil them rotten without worrying about the consequences. How the hell do you tell a grandma that her granddaughter has been raped? </p> <p>I told her carefully, starting with: \"She's okay, but...\" She wasn't okay, of course, but what I meant was that she was alive and she hadn't been mutilated or beaten to a pulp. My mother went quiet at the other end of the telephone. Perhaps she was steadying herself or grabbing a chair in case she fainted, as my sister nearly did when she heard. I asked her if she was all right, but I don't remember what else we said to each other, just that we'd talk later. </p> <p>When we did talk, it was both as mother and daughter and as one mother to another. My mum, aware that the worst thing that can happen to a mother is for something dreadful to happen to her child, was torn between her pain at what had happened to Emma and her pain at what was happening to me as Emma's mother. </p> <p>She said, bizarrely it seemed at first, that in some odd way, she would have found it easier to cope with if it had me who had been raped. That way, she would have only had to deal with the one terrible thing. As it was, she had to cope not only with the awfulness of what her granddaughter had been through, but also the agony that I, in many ways still her baby, was suffering as a mother whose child has been raped. </p> <p>The memory of my own reaction is somewhat hazy. I did not, as you might expect, scour the streets in search of the beast who had violated my daughter and turned our lives upside down. Nor did I even give much thought to revenge or punishment. Whether they caught him or not seemed irrelevant; the fact was that she had been raped and nothing could change that. I was angry, of course, but it was a subdued anger I was totally incapable of expressing. </p> <p>Although my reactions seemed less obvious than those of the rest of the family, they stemmed from the same basic responses. We are always horrified by rape, but when it is your child, the horror is indescribable, and the feelings of revulsion, inadequacy and guilt that you were not there to protect her are magnified to such an extent that you wonder how you can continue to breathe. </p> <p>Three years on, we seem a normal family and we have adapted to the changes, but some things will never be the same. My two little nieces, too young at the time to know what was happening, will, I fear, be allowed less freedom than they may otherwise have enjoyed. I often wonder if, when and what we will tell them about what happened to their cousin. </p> <p>My daughter, who instinctively understood the awkwardness of male friends and relatives, worked hard at reassuring them that she felt relaxed in the company of men she knew and trusted. She still, however, finds it difficult to trust men she didn't know before the rape. Although mature for her age, she was catapulted into a world of which her contemporaries had no experience.

      "body": "<p>Is there a parent in the land who didn't involuntarily shudder on hearing the tale of Richard and Elaine Conway? They left their 13-year-old son Adam alone for the first time, only to return to find the place trashed in less than two hours. It wasn't that Adam had encouraged the rampage; far from it. He had been overwhelmed. The Conways found him wandering haplessly around vomit-streaked walls and beer-soaked beds, with a can of carpet cleaner in his hand. A mob of around 80 teenagers had heard of the parent-free house in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, and, armed with all the usual teenage stimulants, and cocky because there were no bouncers to stand in their way, barged in and ran riot. </p> <p>I immediately thought of the one and only teenage party I'd organised when my eldest of four children, a daughter, was 14. It was three years ago, but it is etched on my memory. Although the ground floor had been cleared, an antique chair stowed away on a landing was discovered, broken, and its legs used as mock guitars. Drunk schoolboys streamed out of the french window, filled the garden bushes with empty lager cans and smuggled-in vodka bottles, and were sick. Other seemingly well-brought up kids smashed the Christmas tree decorations on the floor and danced the pieces into the wood. All the while we had remained, tactfully invisible, not intending to show our faces, in an upstairs bedroom. (The person who became most furious, and blew the whistle, was our three-year-old son, who was woken by the smashing glass, rushed downstairs, and shouted at the big boys to leave his tree alone.) </p> <p>But did the Conways bring it on themselves? Should a boy of 13 be left alone, or with a friend of similar age for company, while parents indulge in a night out? The Conways, in the event, didn't blame their son: he had been unable to get the invading boys out. But he is in that difficult early-teens category, a grey area. It is an age when asserting independence matters, and when parents also start to want some payback, to reclaim their free time again. </p> <p>It is perfectly natural for the interests of parents and teenagers to start diverging dramatically: it is part of growing up and separating, culminating in the all too frequent stroppy refusal to join family events, or take family holidays. What are parents supposed to do? Certainly I've noticed a trend for parents of sixth-form children to take term-time breaks alone, leaving only fairly rudimentary supervision in place. </p> <p>Suzie Hayman, agony aunt of Woman's Own, professional counsellor and author of You Just Don't Listen - a parents guide to communi cating with children - says: \"I'm a great believer in teenagers being given responsibility. They rise to it. But the more you talk to them, rehearse situations that might arise, the better. For example, what might happen if friends come round.\" </p> <p>Thirteen, she says, is too young to be left alone for long, but she advises there should be a sliding scale, taking into account the maturity of the child. This requires individual judgment. \"Some 16-year-olds are very mature. Others are not. There is no hard and fast rule. To leave a 13-year-old overnight alone is foolish.\" </p> <p>The point, she adds, is that a teenager may like having friends round, but not if it means having their place trashed. \"After all, it's their home, too. So you have to role-play with them, imagine what could happen.\" But her attitude hardens for ages below that. </p> <p>\"It is terribly dangerous to leave smaller children alone. The task of being a young child is being curious. You can't punish a child for that. The lesson is that being a parent is just bloody hard work.\" </p> <p>Michele Elliott, director of Kidscape, says in her book Ways to be a Good Parent that there is no law in England stating a specific age for when you can leave children alone, but you can be prosecuted if you do so and they subsequently come to harm (in Scotland it is against the law to leave children alone under 12). And yet, as she says, even though experts say small children shouldn't be left alone, how often have you had to slip across the road to buy milk, post a letter? </p> <p>\"Most parents have found themselves in this position for one reason or another and, fortunately, nothing untoward has happened. I talked with a group of five-year-olds in one school and found 15 out of 20 had been home alone at least once in their lives,\" says Elliott. </p> <p>These figures are borne out by a study presented to the Society for the Research on Adolescence this week in Michigan, which showed that, in America at least, \"latchkey kids\" as young as five were spending more than 45 minutes a day at home alone because of parents working. </p> <p>Valerie Howarth, chief executive of Childline, says it would scare her to death to leave a five-year-old alone. \"No parent should leave their children unless they are absolutely sure they will be properly cared for.\" </p> <p>But it happens. And until there are a range of really practical, affordable options, such as after-school clubs that stay open long enough, it's hard to see it stopping. Elliott's advice for older children is to establish a set of practical ground rules, fire drills, emergency numbers, what do to in case of obscene phone calls and intruders. And surely, parents also should take into account children's fears and needs. </p> <p>Childline had 270 calls from children left alone last year. Some children had been abandoned for days. Others, very young, rang at night, alone and frightened. One girl, aged 14, rang because her mother used her non-stop as a carer for her baby sister. Children as they enter their teens are proud to be given an increasing amount of independence. And younger children relish and probably need time on their own, in a bedroom, or garden, to simply \"muck around\" rather than supervised play. But equally, they do not enjoy feeling abandoned or being really left alone. </p> <p>Childhood fears stalk even apparently well-adjusted children. One of my daughters, when she was seven, rang 999 because she thought she had been left alone. In fact I was simply at the bottom of the garden. But then I wondered if it stemmed back to a genuine muddle, a year earlier, when rushing out to pick up her sister from a friend, we suddenly realised we had forgotten her, playing quietly in her bedroom on the third floor. And we had switched the burglar alarm on! Yes, it had gone off by the time we hared back. Yes, the police were outside, talking to her as she peered panic-stricken through a top floor window. I'm not a bad parent, honest. Just fallible.</p>",

Strangeways, the largest prison in the land, was a scene of utter devastation, yet even then it was possible to imagine that the building would be used again. Strangeways is an ideal city site and its design is excellent for its purpose. The building needed upgrading: the damage provided an opportunity to start afresh. </p> <p>By contrast, Pucklechurch remand centre, outside Bristol, a prison with which I was very familiar by dint of 10 years' membership of its board of visitors, was a burnt-out ruin over which I shed not a tear. It had been a shabby 1950s building, in which no noble aspirations or any real organisational effort had ever been invested, and it never re-opened. Its former young prisoners, held in enforced idleness by a thoroughly alienated staff, dispersed for ever. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the damage was more limited and the prospects for the future more complex. The prisons at Cardiff, Bristol and Glen Parva in Leicestershire, all had obvious roles. But I knew that the penal anachronism on Dartmoor would be the acid test for the success of our efforts. The prison service had many years earlier attempted to close Dartmoor and had mothballed parts of it. Its interior should have become a tourist attraction in the 1960s. But. although totally unsuitable for its contemporary purpose, Dartmoor will continue to be used until we tackle overall prison numbers. </p> <p>Ten months after those initial visits, the Woolf report was published. It grew out of a remarkable series of public consultation exercises, during the course of which much common ground emerged. The report was almost universally welcomed. There seemed a real likelihood that Woolf's key recommendations would be implemented and that prison overcrowding might cease. At a Woolf seminar the then director general, Chris Train, said an end to overcrowding was the \"indispensable precondition of sustained and universal improvement in prison conditions\". The prison population had fallen and stabilised below 45,000. </p> <p>The 1991 Criminal Justice Act, premised on more parsimonious use of imprisonment, was introduced. In 1993, prison capacity and the prison population were in equilibrium for the first time for several decades. Yet Woolf's proposal that no establishment be permitted to hold more than 3% above its certificated number, unless the minister laid an authorising certificate before both houses of parliament, was rejected. In the face of tabloid criticisms, Ken Clarke, the then home secretary, lost his nerve over the 1991 act and reversed key parts of it. </p> <p> His successor, Michael Howard, resorted, unashamedly, to the populist ticket and pronounced what all his advisers in the Home Office knew to be a serious distortion of the truth: \"prison works\". </p> <p>The judges and magistrates sentenced accordingly. The proportion of defendants sentenced to imprisonment in the crown court had, by 1998, increased from 44% to 61%, and in the magistrates courts from 5% to 12%. Sentences also got longer. The prison population soared to its present level of 65,000. The latest Home Office projections - which need not come to pass - anticipate there being anything between 70,400 and 80,300 prisoners in 2007. </p> <p>Woolf's proposals for \"community prisons\" and \"prisoner compacts\" were knocked sideways by the disastrous escapes from Whitemoor and Parkhurst in 1994 and 1995. The resulting Woodcock and Learmont reports may have been intellectually bereft and their proposed super-maximum security prisons and revised prisoner security system will not now be implemented. Nevertheless, sufficient of their recommendations were adopted, greatly increasing the \"depth\" of imprisonment - more security, greater surveillance, fewer opportunities for prisoners to go out. Whereas Woolf saw \"security,\" \"control\" and \"justice\" as complementary and symbiotic components of acceptable prison regimes, Learmont made no reference to \"justice\" and saw \"care\" and \"custody\" as conflicting. Giving them their due weight caused \"confusion\"; custody was the \"primary purpose\". Whereas Woolf entertained prisoners' rights - \"legitimate expectations\" which, if breached, \"could provide an application for judicial review\" - there was instead the introduction of an incentives and earned privileges scheme. The independent evaluation of this scheme found that it was introduced inconsistently, failed to improve prisoner behaviour and did not enhance prisoners' perceptions of staff fairness. </p> <p>Yet despite these dismal developments, the Woolf agenda remains alive because prison personnel go on dusting off the report. They do so because the Woolf analysis is based on some fundamental truths. </p> <p>First, the vast majority of prisoners are in prison briefly - months rather than years. It therefore makes sense for most prisons to be organised according to local catchment areas so that the same agencies with whom prisoners dealt prior to their incarceration, and with whom they will have to deal again on release, are involved in the delivery of prison services. Further, if prisoners' often tenuous contacts with their families are not nurtured, the prospect of them leading law-abiding lives is diminished. Community prisons make sense. Eliminating prisoners' opportunities to exercise responsibility -through home leave, and so on - does not. </p> <p>Second, if prisoners leave prison with a sense of injustice, or if they have been held idle in degrading conditions, then their commitment to the values allegedly underpinning the criminal justice system will not be enhanced, and the whole criminal justice exercise founders. Woolf put the final nail in the coffin of slopping-out and, in report after report, the chief inspector of prisons continues to expose the unfairness and barren futility of some prison regimes - particularly for young prisoners. His recent report on Portland is a case in point. </p> <p>Prisons are generally in better shape than 10 years ago - less overcrowded, better managed, more orderly, providing more active regimes. But there remains a long way to go, and the government's welcome emphasis on offence-focused programmes for prisoners has unfortunately resuscitated a dangerous myth: that prisons provide a good environment within which to make people better. </p> <p>They do not - which is why Dartmoor lives on and there is no talk of closing it.</p> <p>\u0095 Rod Morgan, who was an assessor to Lord Woolf, is professor of criminal justice and director of the centre for criminal justice at the University of Bristol.</p>",

But there remains a long way to go, and the government's welcome emphasis on offence-focused programmes for prisoners has unfortunately resuscitated a dangerous myth: that prisons provide a good environment within which to make people better. They do not - which is why Dartmoor lives on and there is no talk of closing it. \u0095 Rod Morgan, who was an assessor to Lord Woolf, is professor of criminal justice and director of the centre for criminal justice at the University of Bristol.",

      "body": "<p>The Strangeways riot of 1990 was the most serious prison disturbance in England and Wales in the 20th century. But long before the riot, Strangeways had acquired a high media profile. In 1979, Rex Bloomstein produced a remarkable series of BBC TV documentaries on the Manchester prison, exposing for the first time an overcrowded Victorian prison to the British public. The year before the riot, Bloomstein returned to Strangeways because the series was to be repeated. We discussed the possibility of a further programme, but funding was not forthcoming. Otherwise, the cameras might have been inside - as well as outside - the prison on April 1, 1990. </p> <p>Three days before the riot, which was to last 25 days, the chief inspector of prisons published a favourable report on Strangeways. We had been the first large prison to embrace the major staff changes, known as \"Fresh Start\", in 1987. Activities for prisoners had impr oved dramatically and conditions, while still grim, were considerably better than they had been. </p> <p>The magnitude and ferocity of the riot came as a great shock to most staff; the majority of prisoners, too, were numbed by what had happened. Trauma affected everyone in the prison community and many beyond. The most despicable part of the riot was the rioters' savage beating of a group of prisoners awaiting trial for alleged sexual offences. Only the great bravery of members of my staff - and the co-operation with them of some prisoners - prevented fatalities within Strangeways on that dreadful day. </p> <p>Realising the possibility that there had been deaths among prisoners, staff asked the ambulance service whether body-bags were available. This was a sensible precaution, but it changed the course of events. Word reached reporters that there had been deaths, and the media focused in on \"bodies in Strangeways\" - to the detriment of other issues. On April 2, two national tabloids claimed there were 11 and 12 dead; the Manchester Evening News led one edition with the headline \"20 Dead\". </p> <p>The effect on politicians and on prison headquarters was unfortunate. Instead of concentrating on ending the disturbance quickly, London HQ appeared quite distracted with handling the media clamour for confirmation or denial about the number of bodies. The disturbance was not quickly brought under control as I was refused permission to forcibly intervene. Predictably, copycat riots soon broke out across the service. </p> <p>While enormous damage and trauma was caused by the Strangeways and related riots, they triggered a process that led to wholesale improvement within the prison service. In an inspired appointment, the government selected Lord Justice Woolf to head an inquiry. This resulted in probably the most important document about the prison service to be published last century. </p> <p>The recommendations from the Woolf report resulted in dramatic action to improve the service. The rapid installation of integral sanitation hugely improved standards of decency and hygiene in cells. The need to share cells, however, still leaves an unsatisfactory situation: compelling prisoners to use a toilet in front of a fellow prisoner is hardly a standard to be proud of at the start of the 21st century. Prisoners also benefited from measures to improve justice in prisons - the most important being the introduction of a prison ombudsman. </p> <p>Organisational changes also resulted from the Woolf recommendations. Governors now have more discretion to manage their prisons. Prison officers have improved roles - although the delivery of this improvement varies considerably across the service. </p> <p>Perhaps the most radical recommendation aimed to reduce the scourge of overcrowding. A new prison rule would require the responsible minister to report overcrowding to parliament. That proved to be a step too far for politicians and no action has been taken. </p> <p>Two setbacks to the Woolf reforms have occurred. The upward trend of the prison population, evident since the second world war, continued unabated. There are now 65,000 people in custody. Home Office projections forecast that the population will reach between 66,000 and 74,000 by 2007. So England and Wales are likely to continue at the top of the league table of European countries for imprisoning citizens. </p> <p>The second setback was the serious escapades in 1994 and 1995, which led to the Woodcock and Learmont reports into prison security. The resultant substantial increase in prison security diverted resources away from positive rehabilitative programmes for prisoners. The emphasis on security, coupled with a very tight budget, also led to regime restrictions and slowed down the pace of reform. </p> <p>Looking back, the overall effect of the Strangeways riot - while immensely painful and damaging at the time - has been beneficial. </p> <p> Strangeways itself has been modernised and rebuilt. Instead of the 1,750 prisoners I was compelled to detain 10 years ago, the present governor has fewer than 1,300 prisoners, and facilities for them are vastly improved compared to those available when I was governor. Prisoners can be kept better occupied and can lead their lives in custody in reasonable conditions. </p> <p>The Strangeways riots shocked the prison service into a programme of reform which has greatly improved the entire system. </p> <p>But one critical underlying problem remains. How many prisoners should we be locking up? Does our country really want to emulate the US, with an ever-increasing population? Is there not a better way to deal with many of our offenders?</p> <p>\u0095 Brendan O'Friel was governor of Strangeways prison from September 1986 to September 1990.

      "body": "<p>A debate that is rapidly polarising opinion in the disability movement will take centre stage at a Guardian sponsored event in Newcastle next week, when doctors, academics and disability rights activists join the public to discuss how advancements in genetics will affect people with disabilities. </p> <p>Reproductive Choices and Disability Rights is part of a three-day event that aims to tackle mounting concern over the new genetics and the eugenic overtones of scientists' plans for genetic screening, says Tom Shakespeare, a disability and genetics specialist at Newcastle University. </p> <p>The spectre of sterilisation pro grammes carried out in the 20s and 30s in Britain, the US and Germany looms large when genetic tests are discussed. At the heart of the debate is what value society places on the lives of people with disabilities. </p> <p>At the moment during pregnancy doctors can assess whether a foetus is at high risk of developing a number of conditions - the most well-known test is that for Down's syndrome. Increasing understanding of the human genome and of the part genes play in a range of diseases means genetic testing for a wider range of disorders could be available in the near future. </p> <p>Some fear that routine use of genetic testing would dramatically increase the number of women choosing to terminate a pregnancy rather than risk giving birth to a child with a serious impairment. Critics say a rush for genetic testing could be seen as a push to rid society of people with disabilities. </p> <p>The disability movement is struggling to reconcile support for a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, on the grounds that the baby may suffer an impairment, with support for the rights of people with disabilities, says Shakespeare. </p> <p>Most people within the movement are not against genetic screening but they are worried about the implications, he says. People with disabilities can understand why someone might want to terminate a pregnancy if the foetus has a serious degenerative illness with a very short life expectancy, but many would be unhappy about a termination for something like a cleft palate. </p> <p>\"I don't think all doctors are Nazis and are setting out to eliminate disabled people through screening,\" Shakespeare says. \"But there are serious problems with current policies. Abortion [on the grounds of an impairment] is a significant step and shouldn't be taken lightly.\" </p> <p>But very often doctors do not have enough information to put the case for continuing with the pregnancy, says Bill Albert, chair of the British Council of Disabled People's international committee. He says doctors are well-versed in the medical side of a disability but know very little about living with an impairment. </p> <p>Shakespeare says more work is needed to ensure that women have all the information they need to give informed consent to tests and that they aren't bullied into ending the pregnancy. </p> <p>Activists also argue that people with disabilities could face widespread discrimination in employment and financial services unless they are fully involved in debates on the future of genetics. </p> <p>Feelings run high when it comes to misuse of genetic information. In a recent survey carried out by the disability organisation Radar, nine out of 10 respondents thought it should be illegal for employers and insurance companies to have access to the results of genetics tests. They feared that, in the wrong hands, they could be used to refuse people insurance. </p> <p>No doubt this will be one of the issues discussed by the Human Genetics Commission, set up to advise the government. The commission is in the process of drawing up a work programme that will look at the ethical implications of storing genetic information and testing foetuses during pregnancy. As a member of the commission, Albert intends to ensure disabled people's views are heard. </p> <p>Agnes Fletcher, parliamentary officer for Radar, will be speaking at the conference. She believes that, within the next 10 years, there will be legislation to address the discrimination on the grounds of genetic make-up. Meanwhile, \"discussion can only bring us closer together,\" she says. \"We need to reach a consensus in order to create a campaign agenda.\" </p> <p>\"The issues are so emotive and difficult that people need guidance through the 'moral maze',\" says Shakespeare. He hopes the conference will produce a report to help \" men and women make the decisions that are right for them\".</p> <p>\u0095 Reproductive Choices and Disability Rights, will be held at Disability North on April 11, the Dene Centre, Castle Farm Road, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne NE3 1PH (tel: 0191 284 0480; Text phone 0191 285 7261).

People with disabilities can understand why someone might want to terminate a pregnancy if the foetus has a serious degenerative illness with a very short life expectancy, but many would be unhappy about a termination for something like a cleft palate. \"I don't think all doctors are Nazis and are setting out to eliminate disabled people through screening,\" Shakespeare says. \"But there are serious problems with current policies. Abortion [on the grounds of an impairment] is a significant step and shouldn't be taken lightly.\" But very often doctors do not have enough information to put the case for continuing with the pregnancy, says Bill Albert, chair of the British Council of Disabled People's international committee. He says doctors are well-versed in the medical side of a disability but know very little about living with an impairment. Shakespeare says more work is needed to ensure that women have all the information they need to give informed consent to tests and that they aren't bullied into ending the pregnancy. Activists also argue that people with disabilities could face widespread discrimination in employment and financial services unless they are fully involved in debates on the future of genetics. Feelings run high when it comes to misuse of genetic information. In a recent survey carried out by the disability organisation Radar, nine out of 10 respondents thought it should be illegal for employers and insurance companies to have access to the results of genetics tests. They feared that, in the wrong hands, they could be used to refuse people insurance. No doubt this will be one of the issues discussed by the Human Genetics Commission, set up to advise the government. The commission is in the process of drawing up a work programme that will look at the ethical implications of storing genetic information and testing foetuses during pregnancy. As a member of the commission, Albert intends to ensure disabled people's views are heard. Agnes Fletcher, parliamentary officer for Radar, will be speaking at the conference. She believes that, within the next 10 years, there will be legislation to address the discrimination on the grounds of genetic make-up. Meanwhile, \"discussion can only bring us closer together,\" she says. \"We need to reach a consensus in order to create a campaign agenda.\" \"The issues are so emotive and difficult that people need guidance through the 'moral maze',\" says Shakespeare. He hopes the conference will produce a report to help \" men and women make the decisions that are right for them\". \u0095 Reproductive Choices and Disability Rights, will be held at Disability North on April 11, the Dene Centre, Castle Farm Road, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne NE3 1PH (tel: 0191 284 0480; Text phone 0191 285 7261). The symposium is from April 10-12.",

Hence the requirement to have a lay person on the board, along with local GPs, nurses and social services representatives. Overall, the board has one main function - to decide what services are needed to improve the health of its local residents. Simple as that may sound, it is far from straightforward, as I have discovered over the past year and a half. </p> <p>It didn't take me long to realise that there was a problem with resources. Although the Middlesbrough and Eston PCG has an annual budget in excess of \u00a3100m, the bulk of the money automatically goes on buying routine services (hip replacements, coronary artery by-pass grafts and the like) as well as covering the \u00a320m prescribing budget. In other words, existing demands make it difficult for the PCG to start to shift priorities in the direction of, say, health promotion or complementary therapies. </p> <p> M ore recently, I found out more about the way that money is devolved to the PCG. Believe it or not, instead of getting all its money at the beginning of the financial year, a certain amount goes direct to the local hospitals the PCG contracts with. </p> <p>The reason, apparently, is to cover the costs of inflation faced by the acute sector. This happens, mark you, before the PCG has even decided what its priorities are for that year. It's a bit like going to the local greengrocer and only having enough left over to buy one banana from the bunch, because someone else has already handed your money over to cover the greengrocer's inflationary costs in getting those bananas (whether you wanted them or not). </p> <p>By this stage, I was six months into the job and still grappling with the intricacies of NHS finances and its structures. I had done very little in the way of consultation with local people. I now needed to think about how the board was going to find out what local people wanted in terms of health care. But that in itself is an expensive business and begs a number of difficult questions. For instance, what should the PCG ask its local residents? Whom should it ask and how many? How does it ask them? Through questionnaires? Or a representative sample of the public? Or a citizens' jury? Or a selected group of people on a talk-back panel? And how often? Finally, and crucially, how should the PCG weigh up conflicting public demands, given that 195,000 people are unlikely to agree on one set of priorities? </p> <p>To make matters even more complicated, I have also realised recently that the PCG cannot consult in a vacuum. In other words, people need information on which to base their decisions. For instance, there is no point asking people for their views about, say, a change in service, without giving them the relevant information. The trouble is that the only people likely to be interested are those who already make use of it. And the chances are that they will oppose it. </p> <p>What I have learnt over the past year and a half is that the general public is not much interested in the provision of health care services at all, whether at a local or national level.

Billions have been spent, particularly under a Tory government, transforming docklands and riversides, creating flashy business parks, building office blocks and hotels - in short, making city centres look nicer. </p> <p>The idea was that the wealth from these publicly-funded enterprises would somehow trickle down to the poorest in society, improving cities as a whole. It didn't. Coming to power almost three years ago, Labour recognised that bricks and mortar alone could not solve deep-seated problems. It launched the social exclusion unit, led by a young Treasury cum Downing Street high flyer, Moira Wallace, to work out how the marginalised in society - often ghettoised on run-down estates - could be brought up to the norm. </p> <p>As Tony Blair lamented 18 months ago, when unveiling its preliminary neighbourhood renewal strategy, urban problems - from decaying housing, unemployment, street crime, nightmare neighbours, abandoned banks and shops - had become so acute that . . . \"over the last two decades, the gap between these 'worst estates' and the rest of the country has grown . . . it has left us with a situation no civilised society should tolerate . . . it shames us as a nation.\" </p> <p>On a reborn council estate in Hackney, rescued from the brink by tenants in partnership with the local council, the prime minister started an initiative designed to cut across government departments and present neighbourhoods with co-ordinated programmes - some task, when the performance and innovation unit at the cabinet office reported barely two months ago that \"there are too many government initiatives causing confusion, not enough co-ordination, and too much time spent on negotiating the system, rather than delivering.\" So there's some ground to make up. </p> <p>On that Hackney estate, alongside councillors and com munity leaders, Tony Blair launched an \u00a3800m New Deal for Communities programme, with pilot schemes in 17 \"pathfinder\" districts. Crucially, he also set in train 18 cross-cutting policy action teams (Pats) to report on problems in a variety of areas - from job and skill shortages, to business revival, housing abandonment and anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>Next week, a full-blown national strategy of neighbourhood renewal, based on reports from those action teams, will be launched by Tony Blair. There will be much talk of cross-cutting initiatives, new programmes - probably an extension of New Deal - and even, perhaps, a new (or re-branded) minister to push things forward. More money - lots of it - is being sought from July's three-year comprehensive spending review, which will kick-in next year. </p> <p> Research for the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has already identified 1,370 estates which can be classified as \"run-down\"; the English house condition survey has actually identified at least 3,000 poor neighbourhoods. But the exclusion unit has pointed to 44 local authority districts with the highest concentrations of deprivation in England. </p> <p>They have nearly two thirds more unemployment than average, a level of underage pregnancy and lone parenting one-and-a-half-times the norm, mortality rates 30% higher than average and up to three times the level of poor housing. Throw in a quarter of adults with poor literacy and numeracy, poor exam results among teenagers and high levels of income support all round, and you construct an urban horror story. Our run-down neighbourhoods are now among the poorest in the western world. </p> <p>While the 18 policy action team reports, most of which have now been completed, make sober reading, they do point a way forward. The scale of unpopular, or blighted, housing - 377,000 coun cil houses (11% of the national stock) and a further 90,000 housing association properties (8%) - is identified for the first time. Recommendation: think of alternative uses (students, nurses?). </p> <p>Anti-social behaviour, not surprisingly, is on the increase, with reports to police of disorder offences up by 20% in the two years up to 1998 alone. But then, it is fuelled by \"wider problems of social exclusion and deprivation . . . poverty, unemployment, family breakdown.\" Suggestion: crime and disorder partnerships, promote prevention, improve street lighting, etc. </p> <p>Jobs, business, skills, are also covered. While some of the findings might appear self-evident, reminding decision makers \"of a lack of networks linking people without jobs to the employers with jobs to fill\" is no bad thing; that education and training for adults is often \"physically remote\" and that public sector education and training somehow misses the disadvantaged. </p> <p>Crucially, there is no national strategy or framework for providing support to enterprise in deprived communities, with services seen as inaccessible or unapproachable. Marooned on estates with few of the facilities most of us take for granted, the poor have simply withdrawn (or been forced to withdraw): over 2m use no financial service. With no car, and with public transport expensive, they can't take advantage of cut-price shopping. While the number of superstores has almost trebled in 10 years to well over 1,100, the number of independent stores has dropped by 40%. </p> <p>In short, the scale of deprivation in England has never been subjected to such rigorous analysis. Whether it can be tackled by an administration committed to joining up initiatives - while, ironically, still presiding over a complex array of disjointed programmes - remains to be seen. And whether regional economies, particularly in the more depressed north, can be tilted to address the marginalised and the \"have nots\" is another question altogether.</p>",

As Tony Blair lamented 18 months ago, when unveiling its preliminary neighbourhood renewal strategy, urban problems - from decaying housing, unemployment, street crime, nightmare neighbours, abandoned banks and shops - had become so acute that . . . \"over the last two decades, the gap between these 'worst estates' and the rest of the country has grown . . . it has left us with a situation no civilised society should tolerate . . . it shames us as a nation.\" On a reborn council estate in Hackney, rescued from the brink by tenants in partnership with the local council, the prime minister started an initiative designed to cut across government departments and present neighbourhoods with co-ordinated programmes - some task, when the performance and innovation unit at the cabinet office reported barely two months ago that \"there are too many government initiatives causing confusion, not enough co-ordination, and too much time spent on negotiating the system, rather than delivering.\" So there's some ground to make up. On that Hackney estate, alongside councillors and com munity leaders, Tony Blair launched an \u00a3800m New Deal for Communities programme, with pilot schemes in 17 \"pathfinder\" districts. Crucially, he also set in train 18 cross-cutting policy action teams (Pats) to report on problems in a variety of areas - from job and skill shortages, to business revival, housing abandonment and anti-social behaviour. Next week, a full-blown national strategy of neighbourhood renewal, based on reports from those action teams, will be launched by Tony Blair. There will be much talk of cross-cutting initiatives, new programmes - probably an extension of New Deal - and even, perhaps, a new (or re-branded) minister to push things forward. More money - lots of it - is being sought from July's three-year comprehensive spending review, which will kick-in next year. Research for the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has already identified 1,370 estates which can be classified as \"run-down\"; the English house condition survey has actually identified at least 3,000 poor neighbourhoods. But the exclusion unit has pointed to 44 local authority districts with the highest concentrations of deprivation in England. They have nearly two thirds more unemployment than average, a level of underage pregnancy and lone parenting one-and-a-half-times the norm, mortality rates 30% higher than average and up to three times the level of poor housing. Throw in a quarter of adults with poor literacy and numeracy, poor exam results among teenagers and high levels of income support all round, and you construct an urban horror story. Our run-down neighbourhoods are now among the poorest in the western world. While the 18 policy action team reports, most of which have now been completed, make sober reading, they do point a way forward. The scale of unpopular, or blighted, housing - 377,000 coun cil houses (11% of the national stock) and a further 90,000 housing association properties (8%) - is identified for the first time. Recommendation: think of alternative uses (students, nurses?). Anti-social behaviour, not surprisingly, is on the increase, with reports to police of disorder offences up by 20% in the two years up to 1998 alone. But then, it is fuelled by \"wider problems of social exclusion and deprivation . . . poverty, unemployment, family breakdown.\" Suggestion: crime and disorder partnerships, promote prevention, improve street lighting, etc. Jobs, business, skills, are also covered. While some of the findings might appear self-evident, reminding decision makers \"of a lack of networks linking people without jobs to the employers with jobs to fill\" is no bad thing; that education and training for adults is often \"physically remote\" and that public sector education and training somehow misses the disadvantaged. Crucially, there is no national strategy or framework for providing support to enterprise in deprived communities, with services seen as inaccessible or unapproachable. Marooned on estates with few of the facilities most of us take for granted, the poor have simply withdrawn (or been forced to withdraw): over 2m use no financial service. With no car, and with public transport expensive, they can't take advantage of cut-price shopping. While the number of superstores has almost trebled in 10 years to well over 1,100, the number of independent stores has dropped by 40%. In short, the scale of deprivation in England has never been subjected to such rigorous analysis. Whether it can be tackled by an administration committed to joining up initiatives - while, ironically, still presiding over a complex array of disjointed programmes - remains to be seen. And whether regional economies, particularly in the more depressed north, can be tilted to address the marginalised and the \"have nots\" is another question altogether.",

In Los Angeles, five gay men fell sick with rare symptoms suggestive of immunological problems, which prompted two local doctors to write a paper for the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Meanwhile, in Mugana, northern Tanzania, a German missionary doctor saw five women from the Ugandan border region, all suffering from untreatable anaerobic ulcers of the groin and anus. Some new pathogen was abroad, and these doctors were among the first to recognise that fact. </p> <p>Before long, the beast was named. By 1983, the condition of immune collapse had swept through gay communities in the western world, and was given the acronym Aids. Meanwhile, in Africa, the condition spread almost as rapidly among men, women and children. Tanzanian villagers christened the newly-arrived disease \"Juliana\" and Ugandans named it \"Slim\". By 1985, it was realised that the US and African outbreaks were caused by the same pathogen. In both cases, it seems, this pathogen, HIV, had been planted in fertile seed-beds (the gay bath-houses of Los Angeles; the smuggling zone around Lake Victoria) and had prospered. But this begged a further question: where had the new virus sprung from? </p> <p>The classic view about emerging viruses is that there is an unprecedented interaction between humans and their environment (traveller visits bat cave, logging company opens up virgin rain forest), which triggers a zoonosis - a human disease caused by crossover of an animal pathogen. This scenario seems to work well for killer diseases like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa Fever, and has considerably boosted funds to American virology labs. But does it apply equally well to HIV? </p> <p>The disciples of \"natural transfer\", such as the microbiologist Beatrice Hahn, from the University of Alabama, and geneticist Paul Sharp, from the University of Nottingham, believe it does. They propose that a hunter or bushmeat- seller who had skinned or butchered a chimpanzee somewhere in west-central Africa became infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and that this gave birth to the HIV variant (HIV-1 Group M) which has now infected more than 50 million persons worldwide, causing 16 million deaths from Aids. </p> <p>Two other outbreaks of HIV-1 infection (Groups O and N) have been recognised in the 1990s, and these, they say, arose in the same way. When asked why there have apparently been no Aids outbreaks before the late 20th century, they reply that perhaps there have been, but that it took road-building, urbanisation, and new sexual freedoms following independence, to allow the viruses to break free from sequestered African environments and begin their awful spread. </p> <p>This theory of west-central African origin was presented in February 1999, with Hahn adding that a reduction in the chimpanzee bushmeat trade would lessen the chances of future Aids outbreaks. She further claimed (misleadingly) that the local subspecies of chimp was in danger of extinction, which might prevent the development of an effective vaccine. It was a sexy package and it grabbed headlines. </p> <p>However, there were some problems with the theory. First, in the slave trade up to the 1860s, more than 10m Africans from the western seaboard were transported to the Americas. Their viruses and retroviruses came too, but apparently no SIVs or HIVs. Furthermore, there were huge internal population movements in Africa - caused by colonial labour recruitment for plantations, mines and the construction of roads and railways - in the early 20th century, while millions of Africans fought in the two world wars. Yet there was not one visible outbreak of Aids. </p> <p>Second, although the two minor HIV-1 variants, Group O and Group N, have a clear epidemiological hearth in west-central Africa, the pandemic variant, Group M, does not. There is no evidence of Group M being present there before 1981. </p> <p>There is, meanwhile, another HIV, HIV-2, which appears to have descended from the SIV of the sooty mangabey, and which has a hearth in West Africa, especially the tiny state of Guinea-Bissau. </p> <p>The American virologist, Preston Marx, carried out extensive research on sooty mangabey SIV and HIV-2 infections in West Africa and he reached a startling conclusion: that sooty mangabey SIV acquired by hunters or bushmeat sellers resulted in non-pathogenic infections that were hardly, if at all, transmissible; \"dead-end infections\", in short. Natural transfer, he decided, was not by itself enough to cause Aids. </p> <p>Marx felt that an extra factor was needed to turn such viruses into epidemic forms, and he proposed needles - either those reused in poorly-equipped \"country clinics\" or those inadequately sterilised during mass vaccination programmes. What Marx was proposing was a natural transfer from sooty mangabeys, followed by an iatrogenic (physician-caused) amplification of the virus in humans. </p> <p>So, could the needles hypothesis apply in west-central Africa also, and explain the outbreaks of HIV-1-related Aids? </p> <p>The natural transfer school thought it could. In February this year, one of Hahn's colleagues, Bette Korber, addressed a press conference about her research on the dating of the pandemic. She had used a \"super-computer\" to compare many different Group M viral sequences, and proposed that the date of the \"last common ancestor\" was 1930, plus or minus 20 years. Most reporters interpreted this as a chimp hunter getting infected in west-central Africa in 1930, and Korber did not disavow them. </p> <p>When other scientists looked for mass vaccination campaigns in the area, they came up with inoculations against smallpox, yaws, sleeping sickness and yellow fever, starting as long ago as the late 19th century and continuing right through to the present day. </p> <p>I believe, however, that this actually weighs against the natural transfer theory, for despite claiming mechanisms for crossover and amplification, Hahn and Korber still cannot provide evidence of Group M infection in west-central Africa before 1981. However, there is considerable evidence further east, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and Burundi, where M-infected blood is seen from the late 1950s onwards, and Group M-related Aids from the early 1970s. </p> <p>Hahn and Sharp argue that a chimp hunter from west-central Africa could have travelled here soon after getting infected, and sparked the Group M pandemic. The problem is there are approximately 12 subtypes of Group M, which appear to have emerged in the 1950s. Just how did the itinerant hunter start all these? </p> <p>The answer, I believe, is that he did not. I propose a different origin for HIV-1 Group M, pertaining to Chat, an experimental oral polio vaccine (OPV) which, I believe, was prepared in the kidney cells of chimpanzees, nearly 400 of which were sacrificed between 1956 and 1958 at Lindi camp, a vaccine research facility in the then Belgian Congo (now the DRC). </p> <p>The primate cells used to produce Chat were never documented at the time and have never since been revealed. But between 1957 and 1960, Chat vaccine was fed to over a million Africans in the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi - and 64% of all the earliest (retrospectively recognised) Aids cases in Africa, through 1980, come from the same places where Chat was fed. So do 82% of the earliest HIV-1 Group M infections, again through 1980. I have documented 28 Chat campaigns in these former Belgian colonies, and the introduction of different chimp SIV variants in different vaccination venues may provide the explanation for the very different Group M subtypes. </p> <p>It is only 200 miles from the Ruzizi valley, where the biggest mass trial of Chat was staged in 1958, to northern Tanzania, where the Tanzanian army camped for three months in 1978 before driving Idi Amin from Uganda, and where the first cluster of African Aids cases was seen in 1980. And the only other place where experimental variants of Chat were tested was on babies born at Clinton, a women's prison in New Jersey, which lies just 50 miles from where the first plausible HIV-1 infection in the US was identified. </p> <p>My own position has changed somewhat since my book, The River, was published. I now believe that both methods of transfer (natural and iatrogenic, cut hunter and contaminated vaccine) may work. Scientists are now finding \"sputtering forms\" of HIV-1 in the Cameroon, variants which are not related to any of the known subtypes and which look suspiciously like those dead-end HIV-2 infections. Increasingly it seems that natural transfers of SIVs from sooty mangabeys and chimps may occasionally take in humans, but that they neither spread easily, nor readily cause Aids. </p> <p> But for an Aids epidemic or pandemic to occur, I believe what is needed is a mass exposure, as through a vaccination campaign. Perhaps SIVs stand a better chance of infecting humans when prepared in cell culture, and are then introduced by an \"unnatural\" route. Or perhaps it is simply a question of numbers - and only 1 in 10,000 (or 100,000) human exposures to SIV results in a productive infection. </p> <p>My bet is that even those smaller outbreaks of HIV-1 Group O and HIV-2 may have been sparked by experimental vaccine trials. In the late 50s', French polio vaccines, prepared in cells from African primates, were tested in the French colonies of west Africa and west-central Africa. The preferred primates were Guinea baboons which, records reveal, were frequently gang-caged with other monkeys, including sooty mangabeys. </p> <p>However, scores of chimps were also present in the manufacturing labs for vaccine safety testing, and it may be their kidneys (undamaged by this testing) were later incorporated into the French vaccines - just as I believe happened with the Lindi chimps and Chat vaccine.</p> <p>\u0095 Edward Hooper is the author of The River: A Journey Back to the Source of HIV and Aids (Allen Lane/Penguin Press). \u00a9 Edward Hooper 2000</p>",

In Los Angeles, five gay men fell sick with rare symptoms suggestive of immunological problems, which prompted two local doctors to write a paper for the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

      "body": "<p>To many, the government's green paper proposals on the reform of the Mental Health Act appear to be a fait accompli . Their basic premise - that public safety overrides individual rights - appears to be outside the scope of the consultation, which ends on Friday. Concentration on administrative detail has hidden a fundamental erosion in safeguards for the people detained. Few of them have committed any crime, yet they are subject to what would otherwise be deemed false imprisonment and assault. An example of this erosion of safeguards is the abolition of the Mental Health Act managers. </p> <p>Under the current 1983 act, people detained in hospital can ask for their detention to be reviewed by the managers of the hospital. These are lay people, essentially volunteers, and are appointed by the NHS trust to represent its board - which is ultimately responsible for the deprivation of liberty which being sectioned entails. Such a review usually takes the form of an appeal hearing, at which the patient (sometimes through an advocate or solicitor) puts their case for the section to end, and the psychiatrist and other professionals argue why it should not. The managers can end the section, except where a court or the Home Office has imposed restrictions, and thus enable the person to leave hospital. It is a power used sparingly, but it is used - much to the chagrin of psychiatrists, who are not used to their clinical judgment being challenged by members of the public. </p> <p>In addition, the managers' review system has been accused of time-wasting duplication, because detained patients can also appeal to the more formal (and much slower) mental health review tribunal (MHRT). </p> <p>In the green paper, the power to detain is vested in a new type of tribunal only, and this sidesteps any appeal to the trust's managers. The new tribunal may have a minority of lay members, but essentially statutory mental health care is being further formalised and excessively professionalised. </p> <p>Managers - ordinary citizens - are seen as a risky inconvenience, although there is no evidence that managers make any more mistakes than psychiatrists or the MHRT in discharge decisions. NHS trusts have devoted increasing resources to recruiting, inducting and training managers. A unique resource which has taken years to build up - thousands of volunteers with an intimate knowledge of mental health - will be scrapped. </p> <p>The system of managers' hearings is the Robin Hood of statutory mental health care. It robs professionals of time, but it redistributes it to the patient. Often matters get discussed at a managers' hearing which have not been fully aired in ward rounds, where time is rationed. Managers' hearings can even have a therapeutic role, in that when a patient is not discharged, they can sometimes come to a better understanding of why they are detained and, having had their case heard, a greater acceptance of the necessity of detention. </p> <p> The green paper's emphasis is on managing public anxiety - often unfounded - regarding the risk of violence, and not about human rights and the civil liberties of people with mental health problems. There is no discussion about the number of people who will be subjected to compulsion who ought not to be. </p> <p>Professionals are encouraged to err on the side of caution, in an obsessive attempt to capture everyone who might possibly pose a risk to themselves or others. People with mental health problems are not significantly more violent than the population as a whole: if we really want to reduce the amount of threatening behaviour and violence we would do better to lock up every young man leaving a pub after 10pm. </p> <p>Dramatic intervention is sometimes needed to deliver proper treatment when the person cannot make a rational decision on the matter. However, after decades of abuse in Victorian mental institutions, we are in danger of 21st-century complacency that powers of compulsion - in hospital or in the community - will not be misused.</p> <p>\u0095 Nigel Turner has been a Mental Health Act manager for over 15 years; he chairs the Lambeth committee in the South London and Maudsley NHS trust.

Their basic premise - that public safety overrides individual rights - appears to be outside the scope of the consultation, which ends on Friday. Concentration on administrative detail has hidden a fundamental erosion in safeguards for the people detained. Few of them have committed any crime, yet they are subject to what would otherwise be deemed false imprisonment and assault. An example of this erosion of safeguards is the abolition of the Mental Health Act managers. Under the current 1983 act, people detained in hospital can ask for their detention to be reviewed by the managers of the hospital. These are lay people, essentially volunteers, and are appointed by the NHS trust to represent its board - which is ultimately responsible for the deprivation of liberty which being sectioned entails. Such a review usually takes the form of an appeal hearing, at which the patient (sometimes through an advocate or solicitor) puts their case for the section to end, and the psychiatrist and other professionals argue why it should not. The managers can end the section, except where a court or the Home Office has imposed restrictions, and thus enable the person to leave hospital. It is a power used sparingly, but it is used - much to the chagrin of psychiatrists, who are not used to their clinical judgment being challenged by members of the public. In addition, the managers' review system has been accused of time-wasting duplication, because detained patients can also appeal to the more formal (and much slower) mental health review tribunal (MHRT). In the green paper, the power to detain is vested in a new type of tribunal only, and this sidesteps any appeal to the trust's managers. The new tribunal may have a minority of lay members, but essentially statutory mental health care is being further formalised and excessively professionalised. Managers - ordinary citizens - are seen as a risky inconvenience, although there is no evidence that managers make any more mistakes than psychiatrists or the MHRT in discharge decisions. NHS trusts have devoted increasing resources to recruiting, inducting and training managers. A unique resource which has taken years to build up - thousands of volunteers with an intimate knowledge of mental health - will be scrapped. The system of managers' hearings is the Robin Hood of statutory mental health care. It robs professionals of time, but it redistributes it to the patient. Often matters get discussed at a managers' hearing which have not been fully aired in ward rounds, where time is rationed. Managers' hearings can even have a therapeutic role, in that when a patient is not discharged, they can sometimes come to a better understanding of why they are detained and, having had their case heard, a greater acceptance of the necessity of detention. The green paper's emphasis is on managing public anxiety - often unfounded - regarding the risk of violence, and not about human rights and the civil liberties of people with mental health problems. There is no discussion about the number of people who will be subjected to compulsion who ought not to be. Professionals are encouraged to err on the side of caution, in an obsessive attempt to capture everyone who might possibly pose a risk to themselves or others. People with mental health problems are not significantly more violent than the population as a whole: if we really want to reduce the amount of threatening behaviour and violence we would do better to lock up every young man leaving a pub after 10pm. Dramatic intervention is sometimes needed to deliver proper treatment when the person cannot make a rational decision on the matter. However, after decades of abuse in Victorian mental institutions, we are in danger of 21st-century complacency that powers of compulsion - in hospital or in the community - will not be misused. \u0095 Nigel Turner has been a Mental Health Act manager for over 15 years; he chairs the Lambeth committee in the South London and Maudsley NHS trust. He is chief executive of Ealing Consortium, which provides supported housing and community care services.",

Silverstone believes the voluntary sector is lagging behind in responding to the recommendations on tackling institutional racism made by the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. \"I don't feel that the sector has really grasped the issue of diversity,\" he explains. \"If health or local government had acted this slowly people would say it's a scandal. Other sectors have engaged in a fundamental reconsideration of the way they work.\" </p> <p>He points out that new research by London Borough Grants suggests that tackling the diversity question needs to be more co-ordin ated and integrated. \"Addressing this should not just be left to the black and minority ethnic voluntary sector,\" he says. \"The whole sector needs to take all this on board. Our research highlights the view that though some of the larger organisations have equal opportunity procedures, they have become rather passive about the whole thing.\" </p> <p>Silverstone wants to see more directors, trustees, senior managers, policy makers and volunteers from ethnic minority backgrounds. \"I think it's fair to say voluntary organisations are yet to take up this challenge,\" he says. \"Just pick any large major charity and look at how many black trustees they have.

Because these organisations are more involved at the cutting edge of minority issues, there's a sense that they are less likely to be institutionally racist - which, of course, is not necessarily the case.\" </p> <p>Jeremy Crook, director of the Black Training and Enterprise Group, will speak tomorrow on the future role of the black voluntary sector. He agrees that the voluntary sector as a whole needs to be more proactive in addressing race and involving ethnic minorities in what they do. \"The government has taken a lead by setting targets for the recruitment of black and minority individuals and I believe this idea should be adopted by the voluntary sector,\" he says. </p> <p>Crook accepts that the black voluntary sector itself has a lot of work to do. \"The Home Office has put money into the infrastructure of black voluntary groups, and what we are hoping is that this will lead to more engagement with the mainstream voluntary sector,\" he says, adding that black charities tend to feel isolated from mainstream networks. \"Often local contracts are very bureaucratic and many of the smaller groups feel excluded from taking part in the process. Black organisations need to get to grips with business planning, then go out and seize the opportunities on offer.\" </p> <p>He believes that until now the whole subject of diversity has been consigned to the margins of debate. \"But I think that's changing and we're starting to see signs of willingness among the mainstream sector to look at race issues, though only because the Home Office has made it a priority,\" he says. </p> <p>Crook welcomes government moves towards making grants available for mainstream organisations on condition that they have a black voluntary sector partner. \"It's good to see funding being used that way.\" </p> <p>On the issue of funding, tomorrow Charityfair sees the publication of the third UK Voluntary Sector Almanac, which charts trends in charity income.

Both were selected for the first World Cup, in 1975, but Sobers had to pull out with a knee injury \u0095 Don Bradman ranked Shane Warne alongside Bill O'Reilly as the best two spinners he had seen, in a 1995 interview. \"Warne challenges the world's best batsmen like no-one else,\" observed The Don \u0095 Viv Richards and Shane Warne were due to cross swords during Australia's 1993 tour of England, when Richards was playing for Glamorgan - but he didn't play in the match. They will both be on the same field this summer: they have each agreed to play in a memorial match for Malcolm Marshall in London on July 27 (details from Andrew White, 01189 323600) Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Take two innings at another of his favourite spots, the Recreation Ground at St John's, Antigua. West Indies played their first Test there in 1981 - mostly thanks to the prominence Richards himself had given the island. He willed himself to a hundred, edgy by his standards. Five years later, against England again, his mission was to entertain those who had seen him grow up. One hundred came from 56 balls, the swiftest Test century recorded. Sixes disappeared down the high street. Richards could destroy both clinically and ferociously, provided he had a cause to play for.

      "bodyText": "Sir Isaac Alexander Vivian Richards (he was knighted by the Antiguan Government in 1999) separated himself from his rivals by his ability to perform at his peak on the grand occasion. He adored Lord's in a way that is peculiar to overseas players, who first pictured the ground while listening to crackling radios in the old colonies. He played in eight Lord's finals, five for Somerset and three for West Indies, and failed - by normal standards - only once. Even that day, the inaugural World Cup final against Australia in 1975, his fielding altered the course of the match. \"When I was batting at Lord's,\" he said, \"I wanted to make sure that no one else was going to come in. It was my stage.\" When it really mattered, he might proceed a little more cautiously at the start of his innings; he would sweat even more profusely, and then he would set about tinkering with fate as only the great players can. Take two innings at another of his favourite spots, the Recreation Ground at St John's, Antigua. West Indies played their first Test there in 1981 - mostly thanks to the prominence Richards himself had given the island. He willed himself to a hundred, edgy by his standards. Five years later, against England again, his mission was to entertain those who had seen him grow up. One hundred came from 56 balls, the swiftest Test century recorded. Sixes disappeared down the high street. Richards could destroy both clinically and ferociously, provided he had a cause to play for. He usually did.

McKenna was best known for his controversial views on the impact of psychotropic plants on human culture and evolution, expounded through his books Archaic Revival, Food of the Gods and True Hallucinations, his website and lectures. He argued that language, and even consciousness itself, may have been sparked off by consumption of psychoactive mushrooms in ancient cultures and that the human fascination with altered states of consciousness reveals much about our origins as human beings and our place in nature. Travelling widely throughout the Amazon and Tropics, McKenna explored a variety of shamanic cultures and drew heavily on his experiences in his writing; his last book, True Hallucinations, published in 1999, documents his spiritual adventures in the Colombian jungle. As a result of his fears about environmental threats to the rainforest, McKenna co-founded the 19-acre Botanical Dimensions reserve in Hawaii, dedicated to collecting and propagating medicinal and shamanic plants from the world's tropics, as well as the rapidly disappearing folk-knowledge associated with them. McKenna's theories and writings were wide-ranging, evident from the title of his most popular book: The Archaic Revival: Speculations on Psychedelic Mushrooms, the Amazon, Virtual Reality, Ufos, Evolution, Shamanism, and the Rebirth of the Goddess.

      "body": "<b>What does the report say?</b> <br> The report, Consumers Call The Tune, says users have to wait hours to download files and it notes that teenagers - among the biggest devotees of both music and the net - are excluded from legitimately buying online unless they are 18 or over. Meanwhile, adults are wary of using credit cards online because of security risks. The study says people will buy from pirate sites and foreign competitors if they cannot get quicker and easier online access to music. The report was compiled by a section of the government's music industry forum which includes Martin Mills of the Beggars Banquet label and Tony Wadsworth of EMI. <p><b>What does the report recommend?</b><br> A secure online payment system for youngsters and adults; home computers, digital TVs and mobile phones that will be able to play music; and cheaper, faster access to the internet and online music through greater competition among phone operators, digital and cable services. Culture secretary Chris Smith said: \"Consumers are driving the online revolution, and they want the ability to get the music they want, when they want it and where they want it. If the UK music industry is to continue to prosper it must give consumers what they need and a safe way of paying for it.\"</p> <p><b>How do I download music from the net? </b></p> <p><a href=\"http://mp3.com/\" target=\"_NEW\"> MP3</a> was the first digital audio format that made it possible to make music downloadable from the web, but that is now being challenged by a format being developed by <a href=\"http://www.liquidaudio.com/\" target=\"_NEW\"> Liquid Audio</a>, which has come up with its own online digital audio software. <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com/\" target=\"_NEW\"> Emusic</a> is the biggest seller of downloadable music.</p> <p><b>If people can download for free, why do we need music companies? </b></p> <p>True, the net offers access to all and lets bands distribute music without middle men. But click on a site like <a href=\"http://peoplesound.com/home_index.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">peoplesound.com</a>, and shoppers are swamped by unknown bands. Superstardom requires promotion and marketing. The market research company <a href=\"http://www.jup.com/home.jsp\" target=\"_NEW\"> Jupiter Communications</a> said that the revolution would not be instant, forecasting that digital download would not take off until 2003 when it could have an estimated turnover of $147 million.</p> <p><b>Can artists go it alone?</b></p> <p>Some big names have tried to skip the middlemen without much success. <a href=\"http://membres.tripod.fr/ecnirp/ecnirp.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> The Artist's</a> recent attempts to circumvent the record companies and distribute his own music online have not reversed his steady commercial decline. <a href=\"http://www.davidbowie.com/\" target=\"_NEW\"> David Bowie's</a> release of Hours stirred up more media interest than actual sales. But <a href=\"http://www.davidbowie.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Roger Clyne &amp; The Peacemakers</a> showed what can be done. He recorded his band in a little bar club and sold it as digital downloads and Honky Tonk Union made number one on the Top Internet Sales chart in <a href=\"http://www.billboardtalentnet.com/indexhome.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> Billboard magazine</a>. That was only 1,200 internet sales but Clyne marketed himself using the net, a physical CD and live appearances to jumpstart a career.</p> <p><b>How are the record companies fighting back?</b></p> <p>The record labels are countering the threat from MP3 downloads by embracing more sophisticated digitised music formats like Liquid Audio or Microsoft's Windows Media Audio.

      "bodyText": "What does the report say? The report, Consumers Call The Tune, says users have to wait hours to download files and it notes that teenagers - among the biggest devotees of both music and the net - are excluded from legitimately buying online unless they are 18 or over. Meanwhile, adults are wary of using credit cards online because of security risks. The study says people will buy from pirate sites and foreign competitors if they cannot get quicker and easier online access to music. The report was compiled by a section of the government's music industry forum which includes Martin Mills of the Beggars Banquet label and Tony Wadsworth of EMI. What does the report recommend? A secure online payment system for youngsters and adults; home computers, digital TVs and mobile phones that will be able to play music; and cheaper, faster access to the internet and online music through greater competition among phone operators, digital and cable services. Culture secretary Chris Smith said: \"Consumers are driving the online revolution, and they want the ability to get the music they want, when they want it and where they want it. If the UK music industry is to continue to prosper it must give consumers what they need and a safe way of paying for it.\" How do I download music from the net? MP3 was the first digital audio format that made it possible to make music downloadable from the web, but that is now being challenged by a format being developed by Liquid Audio, which has come up with its own online digital audio software. Emusic is the biggest seller of downloadable music. If people can download for free, why do we need music companies? True, the net offers access to all and lets bands distribute music without middle men. But click on a site like peoplesound.com, and shoppers are swamped by unknown bands. Superstardom requires promotion and marketing. The market research company Jupiter Communications said that the revolution would not be instant, forecasting that digital download would not take off until 2003 when it could have an estimated turnover of $147 million. Can artists go it alone? Some big names have tried to skip the middlemen without much success. The Artist's recent attempts to circumvent the record companies and distribute his own music online have not reversed his steady commercial decline. David Bowie's release of Hours stirred up more media interest than actual sales. But Roger Clyne &amp; The Peacemakers showed what can be done. He recorded his band in a little bar club and sold it as digital downloads and Honky Tonk Union made number one on the Top Internet Sales chart in Billboard magazine. That was only 1,200 internet sales but Clyne marketed himself using the net, a physical CD and live appearances to jumpstart a career. How are the record companies fighting back? The record labels are countering the threat from MP3 downloads by embracing more sophisticated digitised music formats like Liquid Audio or Microsoft's Windows Media Audio. These enable files to self-destruct after a pre-set period unless customers pay the required download fee. What about the music stores? Physical retailers are the ones most under threat from the internet revolution. HMV and other retailers face competition from online music sellers such as Amazon.com, as well as from musicians selling their own material directly to the public. Before its deal with Warner Music, EMI entered an agreement with Liquid Audio to digitise its catalogue for potential download. This way EMI would be able to have its archive of material available on demand without having to keep manufacturing copies on CD. Useful links lycos MP3 search site Rioport.com, an audio site",

      "body": "<p>Tracey Emin said it all, really. She was there at Gimpel Fils on Monday night for the great art auction in support of Ken Livingstone. Of course she was. Everyone who was anyone donated works for the great cause - Damien Hirst, Antony Gormley, Sir Anthony Caro, Maggi Hambling, Mona Hatoum (in dazzling pink), Howard Hodgkin et al. Among the glamourati were Neil Pearson alongside a stunning supermodel. Amongst the bidders was David Elstein, head of Channel 5. Champagne popped, Tracey kissed Ken and over \u00a3100,000 was raised for \"the cause\". Thus the art world rode gallantly to the aid of underdog Ken, who is only an unstoppable 30% ahead.</p> <p>So when I asked her why, this is what Tracey Emin said. \"I've been waiting all my life for a Labour government and now I've got one, it's shit.\" Why, exactly? \"It's done nothing for people like me\". (No, don't boggle). Such as? \"There's no money for the health service and people like me don't dare use it and have to go private, so what about the people who can't afford to? Same with education.\" Anything else? \"It's just an incredibly conservative, boring government. Ken's interesting, sexy and dynamic. We need a charismatic, stylish mayor and one who dresses good.\" Yes, it's cool to support Ken. Don't stop to think, just jerk your knee and Ken is where it's at. So of course the art world is there, it's the place to be.</p> <p>As for Tony Blair, he is definitely, definitely not cool, not any more, though he was once. Were any of the radical chic at Gimpel Fils dancing the night away at New Labour's triumph on May 1 1997? Maybe some were in the Festival Hall itself, the glam place to be at the time. But that was then and this is now. Politics-as-fun only offers rare moments of synergy with the glam world, for they are planets best kept well apart. It's a mistake to invite Oasis to Downing Street. What did politics do for Billy Bragg's cred? And of course he dumped on Labour in the end - bound to. They all will, these butterflies from elsewhere. Getting political sense from artists is as likely as getting Tony Blair to resurrect Ugly Rumours and cut a number one hit. Keep these worlds well apart or risk cross-contamination and mutual foolishness.</p> <p>Ken is good at cool, you have to give him that and his hip shelf life may last longer than most. If he keeps needling the boring old government like a teenager taunting his parents he can keep the adolescent tendency happy indefinitely: it's what he does best. How is the uncool grown-up government to handle him? They need to keep one step ahead, give him no easy goals, take away his best lines, but there's scant sign yet of that agility. Like angry parents they rant on, with no damage-limitation strategy. Despairing of Dobson, they sulk in their tent for nothing can stop Livingstone now (even fat cat tax-avoidance seems to charm his fans). And so on Monday Labour needlessly handed Ken yet another quick hit with the chatterati at Gimpel Fils. This is the kind of thing a quick-witted government should see coming.</p> <p>It concerns the vexed question of museum charges. Labour's other heartland - the liberal intelligentsia - care more about this than almost anything. It is a totemic issue, alongside proper funding of the BBC. This Chris Smith well understood: he won the BBC enough money and he promised to fight for free museum admissions. (Charges nearly halved admission numbers).</p> <p>It should have been an easy win and this week he nearly succeeded - but you wouldn't think so. Where are the big headlines? Where the celebrations? For the \u00a330m spent the government has earned precious little credit. For lack of one vital ingredient they have thrown away all the glory - handing Ken a neat anti-government line on the arts. Yet again Labour snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.</p> <p>The good news is that next year all national collections that currently charge will be free to pensioners, children and those on benefits. The rest pay just \u00a31 - victory, you might think. But instead it has left the museum world angry and edgy. Those cutting their charges to \u00a31 cannot guarantee not to raise fees again in future if the government doesn't index-link their grants in perpetuity. But Chris Smith, like any minister, can't guarantee a budget in, say, five years' time, so uncertainty remains. As for a \u00a31 fee, it will cost 70p to collect while another 17.5p goes in VAT, leaving just 12.5p per admission. Why bother? Museums expect to rake in far more from their shops and cafes with so many extra visitors.</p> <p>The reason for the remaining \u00a31 is a governmental absurdity. That token \u00a31 qualifies the charging museums for VAT rebates worth a lot of money. The non-charging museums still get no such rebates which is grossly unfair and a strong incentive for them to charge \u00a31 against their will, to qualify. All those who have stayed free for all these years at great cost now find they are still penalised: those who turned themselves into businesses are rewarded. No, says the government, if any of the free museums try charging that \u00a31 to get the VAT refund, they'll have their grants clawed back accordingly.</p> <p>The villain is customs and excise and Chris Smith lost the crucial battle with them. Perversely, they only let businesses collect VAT rebates. Until now they only deemed museums to be businesses if they charged at least \u00a33, (now reduced to \u00a31). The British Museum has a huge building project on which they can't reclaim most VAT because they don't charge. But it's not even that simple. Behind the scenes the BM and others each negotiate private deals with customs so they don't actually pay full VAT, but a sum secretly agreed. This is arbitrary tax law, giving extraordinary power to customs officers. The National Art Collections Fund (NACF) drew up a plan agreed with the Department for Culture to remove VAT from all museums. Smith promised to do or die with the Treasury over it - and lost. It wasn't the estimated \u00a310m cost. It was customs's claim that it would open the VAT floodgates to all arts and charities. Not so, say the NACF, a water-tight definition ring-fencing the national collections exists which opens no floodgate to anyone else.</p> <p>Joined-up government this is not. Departmental pig-headedness and lack of strategy has left the government spending a lot on doing almost the right thing, but getting no kudos. Who's in charge here? Where was the clever news plan for a happy headline \"Labour frees museums for all\"? What a missed moment. As for all those political butterflies in the art world, why don't they use their energy in their own sphere and campaign for free, no-VAT museums for the next budget? In the meantime, Ken Livingstone will go on having fun with the issue to their applause. Is this a lesson learned? How sadly often Labour drops the ball.</p>",

      "body": "<p> After weeks of speculation, Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Century can now be revealed. They are Sir Donald Bradman (Australia), Sir Garfield Sobers (West Indies), Sir Jack Hobbs (England), Sir Vivian Richards (West Indies), and Shane Warne (Australia). </p> <p>Bradman's supremacy was dramatically underlined by the fact that every single member of the panel voted for him. Sobers did almost as well, receiving 90 votes and leaving no room for any doubt as to who is the all-rounder of the century.</p> <p>Warne, shortly to join Hampshire, is the only current player in the quintet, the only specialist bowler, and the only man without a knighthood. This is the latest in a series of honours for him which began with his being named in Australia's Team of the Century and continued when he broke Dennis Lillee's Australian Test-wickets record. </p> <p>The choice was made for Wisden by a special panel of 100 players and observers of the game, from Alf Gover (aged 92) to Steve Waugh (34). The panel included voters from every Test nation, but their final choice of five came from only three teams - two Australians, two West Indians and an Englishman. </p> <p> If Bradman and Sobers were shoo-ins, the final three places were hotly contested, with 47 other players receiving at least one vote, but in the end, there was a clear verdict.

      "bodyText": "After weeks of speculation, Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Century can now be revealed. They are Sir Donald Bradman (Australia), Sir Garfield Sobers (West Indies), Sir Jack Hobbs (England), Sir Vivian Richards (West Indies), and Shane Warne (Australia). Bradman's supremacy was dramatically underlined by the fact that every single member of the panel voted for him. Sobers did almost as well, receiving 90 votes and leaving no room for any doubt as to who is the all-rounder of the century. Warne, shortly to join Hampshire, is the only current player in the quintet, the only specialist bowler, and the only man without a knighthood. This is the latest in a series of honours for him which began with his being named in Australia's Team of the Century and continued when he broke Dennis Lillee's Australian Test-wickets record. The choice was made for Wisden by a special panel of 100 players and observers of the game, from Alf Gover (aged 92) to Steve Waugh (34). The panel included voters from every Test nation, but their final choice of five came from only three teams - two Australians, two West Indians and an Englishman. If Bradman and Sobers were shoo-ins, the final three places were hotly contested, with 47 other players receiving at least one vote, but in the end, there was a clear verdict. Hobbs received 30 votes, Warne 27, and Viv Richards 25, six more than the best of the rest, Dennis Lillee and Sir Frank Worrell (19 each). Warne was far and away the greatest of today's players in the eyes of the panel, winning twice as many votes as the other four current players on the list put together - Sachin Tendulkar of India (6), Wasim Akram of Pakistan (3), Curtly Ambrose of West Indies and Allan Donald of South Africa (1 each). England had 17 players on the list, but not many recent ones. After Hobbs, England's top 12 of the century were reckoned to be Wally Hammond (18 votes), Denis Compton (14), SF Barnes and Sir Len Hutton (both 11), Ian Botham (only 9), Harold Larwood (6), Wilfred Rhodes (4), Godfrey Evans (3), and Sir Alec Bedser, Fred Trueman and Frank Woolley (2 each).

John Denham, the health minister, has said: \"It will be for local communities to decide the pace of change that is right for them.\" </p> <p>His words have come back to haunt him in Southend, however, where the PCT has been given the green light despite a 58% vote against the plan by local GPs. The postal ballot, organised by the local medical committee, attracted an 87% response and prompted the four national bodies representing family doctors to issue an unprecedented joint declaration that \"no primary care group should proceed to primary care trust status until the majority of GPs are in favour of it\". </p> <p> Following the ballot, Denham said the Southend trust should proceed only if \"significant progress\" was made before April 1 to meet local doctors' concerns. A Department of Health spokeswoman said last week that the regional NHS office was satisfied that such progress had been achieved. But local opinion remains sharply divided. </p> <p>Brian Balmer, secretary of Southend medical committee, says he is unaware of any progress. \"What people have been asking for is the chance to evaluate the PCG. We are constantly told to practise evidence based medicine, but here we are moving from the unproven to the totally unknown. Why the rush?\" </p> <p>Some support for this view comes in a new, interim report of a national evaluation of PCGs by the health services management centre at Birmingham University. To date, says the report, the groups have been largely preoccupied with getting themselves up and running: service commissioning has been slow to develop and \"tangible service changes are taking time to appear\". In essence, the groups remain in development. </p> <p>A sense of unseemly haste in pushing ahead with PCTs is felt particularly by many in the mental health field. Ministers initially signalled a preference for creating specialist mental health trusts, but then changed tack and announced that PCTs could opt to provide community mental health services. </p> <p>Muijen is enthusiastic about the flexibility and responsiveness of the PCT idea in relation to health care as a whole. It is even possible, he acknowledges, that some effective approaches to mental health could emerge within a few years. But meanwhile he is alarmed at the prospect of an increasingly confused structure, with some PCTs running services and some not, and with gulfs reopening between hospital and community care and between health and social services provision. </p> <p>Paraphrasing the famous dictum of the late Sir Roy Griffiths, architect of the 1993 community care system, Muijen warns that this week's watershed could lead to mental health being treated as \"everyone's distant relative but no one's child\".</p>",

Near misses are inevitable because humans will always make mistakes. What the airline industry has done is to accept this and set up systems which will compensate for human error and avoid disaster. The health service, much to taxpayers' and patients' cost, has not yet managed to do that. It should set to work on that task and stop demonising both the patients, who rightly seek compensation when their health is damaged by avoidable error, and the lawyers who help them.",

The last name is that of a striker, West Ham's Paul Kitson (currently on loan at Charlton). He's scored for the Hammers, Newcastle, Derby and Leicester. Q \"I don't suppose you know the name of the music played during Match of the Day's 'Goal of the Month competition?\" asks James. A The title of the music is 'Sequence 3' by Italian brotherly beat combo GF and GP Reverbi. It's taken from an album entitled 'Erotica Italia' which is available on Bistro records. You might also be interested to know that the original Match of the Day music is by Barry Stoller and the Musicians, and was especially commissioned for the programme in 1964. Unfortunately it's not commercially available. Finally, the music used at the top of the programme during Gary Lineker's introduction is called 'You Must Know' by Bernard Butler, and is available on Creation Records. Q \"Please could you name the England U-21 team that played in the Toulon tournament in 1990?\" asks Richard Glover A In 1990 England's U-21 squad won the eight-nation tournament in Toulon for the first time with the following squad: Crossley, Muggleton, Lee, Sharpe, Le Saux, Barrett, Tiler, Sherwood, James, Ebbrell (capt.), Blake, Matthew, Thomas, Stuart, Slater, Olney, Robins. Shortly afterwards the full England side reached the semi-finals of the World Cup, and many thought this U-21 team would make up the nucleus of England's 1994 World Cup side. Things didn't quite turn out as forecast, although some players did go on to become full England internationals (notably Le Saux, Sharpe and Sherwood), and one (Crossley) bizarrely played for Wales. Sadly, most of the exalted class of 1990 have become journeyman club players, plying their trade in the lower leagues.",

Myles Hodgson, the PA cricket correspondent, reacted quickest to the news, which was broken at 10am on www.wisden.com, and led with the omission of Ian Botham, saying he had been \"surprisingly overlooked\". Hodgson went on to mention that Botham, \"widely regarded as one of the great players of the modern era, finished a disappointing 16th\".

She loves every minute of her time in this culturally unique region.</p> <p>How you'd make out financially would depend on your family circumstances, whether you eat local produce or imported food, and who you work for. The Language Centre, Sultan Qaboos University, pays 700 rials a month (\u00a31,129 with an exchange rate of .63 rials to the \u00a3) to instructors with an RSA DipTEFL or equivalent and 800 rials to lecturers with a master's. This is tax free, as is the accommodation - usually a three bedroom house on campus or villa or flat off campus. Your utilities would average out at 10 - 15 rials a month for water, electricity and internet connection; that is, if you use bottled gas and have water connected to the mains. Petrol is .180 rial per litre, while a fresh chicken is .800, so you can live quite cheaply.</p> <p>English is widely spoken and understood but courtesy would demand you speak some Arabic and this is widely appreciated, especially by the people in the interior.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"\" b> Teaching</a></strong><br> ELT is a growth industry. Thirty years ago, Oman had three schools, now there are almost a thousand state schools, with 20 university-level colleges as well as many private schools and an internationally renowned university. </p> <p>The Language Centre, Sultan Qaboos University conducts an intensive programme of general and academic English to prepare an intake of over a thousand students to study for their degree subjects in English. The 120-plus staff teach on average 20 hours a week. Juliet Arden-Close, a lecturer at the Centre, is not unusual in enjoying teaching at the Centre: 'The students are keen, highly motivated and fun to teach.'</p> <p>The British School, Muscat, provides a programme based on the British National Curriculum with English as the medium of instruction. Experience of the British school system would be an important asset for prospective applicants rather than years of overseas EFL teaching.</p> <p>Sarah Joseph teaches EFL to learners ranging from 11 - 15 at the Royal Guard of Oman College of Technology in Muscat: \"The boys are generally excellent and very polite and a joy to teach.\" Salaries start from 950 rials per month, with free accommodation and 'good holidays'. Recruitment is either local or through the UK TEFL press.</p> <p>The British Council offers a range of opportunities including teaching young learners and young adults and general and job-related English to adults. CELTA and an add-on CELTYL module are also delivered. Recruitment is either local or through the BC in UK or, if you are already at post, through the Council's bulletins.</p> <p>The colleges of Education at Sohar, Salalah, Sur, Ibri, Rustaq and Nizwa provide opportunities for teaching general and ESP but the trainee teachers are not going to teach English, and problems of motivation might have to be addressed by a resourceful teacher. At the time of writing, recruitment for these posts is shifting from private agencies to the Ministry of Education, though CfBT Reading might be able to advise.</p> <p>Oman is a rewarding place to teach and has all the advantages of a vibrant and fascinating culture and dignified, friendly people. </p> <p>Class size is rarely more than twenty and this is consistent with the EFL methods preferred, whether students are interacting with a text, the teacher or each other, an approach which means lively classes. As school curricula are constantly being upgraded, most students have not up to now been used to this type of interactive learning at secondary school, and a degree of tact and patience is required to break down shyness and a reluctance to speak in class; this could be due to male students being unaccustomed to a woman teacher or vice versa, or from the fact that male and female students are together - though sitting apart - in the same classroom. </p> <p>Autonomous learning and independent thinking are stressed in Oman today and students at SQU first research a project utilising their freshly acquired library skills and later in the year present a topic to the class, complete with OHTs. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"\" c>Key points to remember </a></strong><br> \u0095 Check your terms and conditions</p> <p>\u0095 Check when your first paycheque will arrive</p> <p>\u0095 SQU insists on attested certificates of service from former employers - check which they want as this can be costly and time-consuming.

How you'd make out financially would depend on your family circumstances, whether you eat local produce or imported food, and who you work for. The Language Centre, Sultan Qaboos University, pays 700 rials a month (\u00a31,129 with an exchange rate of .63 rials to the \u00a3) to instructors with an RSA DipTEFL or equivalent and 800 rials to lecturers with a master's. This is tax free, as is the accommodation - usually a three bedroom house on campus or villa or flat off campus. Your utilities would average out at 10 - 15 rials a month for water, electricity and internet connection; that is, if you use bottled gas and have water connected to the mains. Petrol is .180 rial per litre, while a fresh chicken is .800, so you can live quite cheaply. English is widely spoken and understood but courtesy would demand you speak some Arabic and this is widely appreciated, especially by the people in the interior. Teaching ELT is a growth industry. Thirty years ago, Oman had three schools, now there are almost a thousand state schools, with 20 university-level colleges as well as many private schools and an internationally renowned university. The Language Centre, Sultan Qaboos University conducts an intensive programme of general and academic English to prepare an intake of over a thousand students to study for their degree subjects in English. The 120-plus staff teach on average 20 hours a week. Juliet Arden-Close, a lecturer at the Centre, is not unusual in enjoying teaching at the Centre: 'The students are keen, highly motivated and fun to teach.' The British School, Muscat, provides a programme based on the British National Curriculum with English as the medium of instruction. Experience of the British school system would be an important asset for prospective applicants rather than years of overseas EFL teaching. Sarah Joseph teaches EFL to learners ranging from 11 - 15 at the Royal Guard of Oman College of Technology in Muscat: \"The boys are generally excellent and very polite and a joy to teach.\" Salaries start from 950 rials per month, with free accommodation and 'good holidays'. Recruitment is either local or through the UK TEFL press. The British Council offers a range of opportunities including teaching young learners and young adults and general and job-related English to adults. CELTA and an add-on CELTYL module are also delivered. Recruitment is either local or through the BC in UK or, if you are already at post, through the Council's bulletins. The colleges of Education at Sohar, Salalah, Sur, Ibri, Rustaq and Nizwa provide opportunities for teaching general and ESP but the trainee teachers are not going to teach English, and problems of motivation might have to be addressed by a resourceful teacher. At the time of writing, recruitment for these posts is shifting from private agencies to the Ministry of Education, though CfBT Reading might be able to advise. Oman is a rewarding place to teach and has all the advantages of a vibrant and fascinating culture and dignified, friendly people. Class size is rarely more than twenty and this is consistent with the EFL methods preferred, whether students are interacting with a text, the teacher or each other, an approach which means lively classes. As school curricula are constantly being upgraded, most students have not up to now been used to this type of interactive learning at secondary school, and a degree of tact and patience is required to break down shyness and a reluctance to speak in class; this could be due to male students being unaccustomed to a woman teacher or vice versa, or from the fact that male and female students are together - though sitting apart - in the same classroom. Autonomous learning and independent thinking are stressed in Oman today and students at SQU first research a project utilising their freshly acquired library skills and later in the year present a topic to the class, complete with OHTs. Key points to remember \u0095 Check your terms and conditions \u0095 Check when your first paycheque will arrive \u0095 SQU insists on attested certificates of service from former employers - check which they want as this can be costly and time-consuming. You will also need attested degree certificates.

Nor does it contain a player from the subcontinent. </p> <p>Killing these two birds with one man isn't easy: the only contenders are Wasim Akram (great but not that great), Waqar Younis (ditto), Kapil (a great entertainer, and a great survivor, but surely fourth out of four among the allrounders of his time), and Imran. </p> <p>Imran was the first great fast bowler ever to come out of Pakistan, and the only one from anywhere who managed to turn himself, when his pace faded, into a front-line batsman. He was also an outstanding captain who won the World Cup with a superhuman recovery from a desperate position. He came 10th equal in this poll; in my book, he would have come fifth.

The boy's mother and 12 other Cubans were drowned on their disastrous migrant voyage to the US in November. \"As a precaution, I will not tell him until everything is certain,\" she told journalists before she fell ill. She claimed that whenever the possibility of the father's arrival was mentioned, \"all he asks me is 'please don't let them take me'.\" Juan Miguel Gonzalez and Cuban officials have accused Elian's Miami relatives of manipulating the boy to suit the rightwing exile groups backing them, for whom his fate has become a symbolic struggle with Fidel Castro's regime. Meanwhile, the Cuban government has taken over negotiations on behalf of Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Luis Fernandez, spokesman at the Cuban Interests Office in Washington, said yesterday: \"Juan Miguel is coming as soon as he receives the guarantee from the justice department and the INS [Immigration and Naturalisation Service] that he is going to receive the custody of his boy.\" Al Gore, the vice-president and Democratic contender for the presidency, intervened once more in the family tussle yesterday. In an apparent bid to win Cuban-American votes in Florida, Mr Gore stunned the White House last week by breaking ranks with the Clinton administration and backing measures to grant Elian and his father permanent residence and to hand the matter of custody to a family court. Yesterday, after criticism from senior Democrats, Mr Gore argued that the boy should be allowed to return to Cuba with his father \"if the father says on free soil that he believes that the son should go back to Cuba with him.\" An opinion poll published yesterday found that 56% of US citizens questioned believed Elian should be allowed to return to his father and to Cuba while 31% opposed his return. However, more than 80% of Cuban-Americans in Florida are backing the Miami relatives' battle to gain custody of Elian, and they are expected to be a big factor in determining who wins Florida in this year's presidential elections. The state's governor, Jeb Bush - brother of the Republican presidential contender George W Bush - met public safety officials to discuss how to respond to civil unrest if Elian was returned to Cuba. Papers take up the fight: Boston Herald While sad and unfortunate that his mother died in the process of her kidnapping, all appropriate considerations compel a swift return of Elian to his father's home in Cuba. And, without a Cuban circus intertwined with an American presidential election campaign, that is what should have happened! Seattle Times The US means well, but we are rapidly losing our ability to do anything that makes sense regarding little Elian. However well-motivated Elian's Florida relatives might have been at the beginning, there seems no doubt that at least some of them have come to regard Elian not as their spunky little cousin, but as a political trophy. San Francisco Chronicle The plight of Elian has been trapped behind the iron barricades for too long, drowned out by the rabble rousers and buried in speechmaking by officials. Elian, the desperate castaway child has given way to Elian the street crusade.",

      "bodyText": "Europe is preparing to spearhead large aid deliveries to the Horn of Africa in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the famine that claimed close to a million lives in Ethiopia 15 years ago. The United Nations warned that up to 16m people could face starvation within weeks after repeated crop failures caused by prolonged drought and years of conflict in the region. It appealed for $200m (\u00a3122m) to address the crisis. The EU commissioner for development, Poul Nielson, yesterday said donors plan to ship 800,000 tonnes of food to Ethiopia, where the bulk of people are at risk. \"We are getting organised and we see this [famine] as a big threat coming,\" he said. \"Everybody is following this situation with very great concern. If we now can plan in a reasonably professional way actually to move 800,000 tonnes, that's a good start. \"We have people from the European commission on site in the Horn of Africa today trying to assess the situation. It is indeed a major operation,\" he added. The World Food Programme director, Catherine Bertini, is scheduled to fly to the region next week to assess the extent of the crisis. The Ethiopian government says 8m of its people face starvation. Millions more in Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda and Djibouti are at risk. Among the hardest hit areas is the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia, where it has not rained in three years. Aid workers say dozens, if not hundreds, of children are dying each day from malnutrition and diseases such as measles and tuberculosis. Thousands of people have left their homes in search of water and food. Earlier this week, the UN children's agency, Unicef, complained that there had not been any response to earlier appeals for urgent famine relief. But EU officials say that enough food aid for the region has been committed by Europe, the US and international aid agencies. Britain says \u00a32.4m of UK food aid is already being distributed. The problem now is to find efficient ways of delivering it. Continued fighting in Somalia makes distribution very difficult, as does the civil war in Sudan. The conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has closed the port of Massawa in Eritrea and left Djibouti as the only port in the region open to handle food distribution.It is not large enough to cope with the amounts needed. \"If we had peace and normal relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea, then the harbour of Massawa would also be available and the problem more manageable,\" Mr Nielson said. As it is, a large proportion of food will probably have to be airdropped, considerably increasing costs. Britain's international development secretary, Clare Short, said: \"The failure of the last three years' rains is the root cause of Ethiopia's current crisis, but there is little doubt that the continuing conflict with Eritrea is hampering the response to the relief effort and valuable resources are being diverted to perpetuating the conflict.\" She urged all sides to \"intensify their efforts\" to end the conflict \"so that all efforts can be focused on providing relief and on the longer-term struggle against deep-seated poverty in Ethiopia\". But Oxfam yesterday blamed the looming crisis in part on the EU for delivering little more than half the food it promised last year. It said that food donations are still not coming fast enough. \"The world can't wait for that to happen.

Burundi in particular is facing a poor harvest because about 800,000 Hutu peasant farmers were herded into what the government calls \"relocation camps\" and others have denounced as concentration camps. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, severe food shortages and malnutrition are reported among large numbers of refugees in the north and east of the country, which has been the focus of the civil war. The World Food Programme is already committed to months of food deliveries to nearly 1m people hit by floods and cyclones in Mozambique and Madagascar.",

      "body": "<p>Tensions have risen further in Zimbabwe with the news that a policeman was shot dead yesterday, apparently by squatters resisting arrest for beating a white farmer.</p> <p>Police were arresting several squatters for allegedly assaulting farmer Ian Kay when a fracas broke out and shots were fired. A police spokesman, Bothwell Mugariri, confirmed that a constable died, but gave no other details.</p> <p>Mr Kay was severely assaulted on Monday by about 25 squatters on his farm near Marondera, 75 miles east of Harare. The squatters bound Mr Kay's wrists with wire, whipped him across the back and beat his head. He was hospitalised in Marondera and was expected to be released late yesterday.</p> <p>The squatters are led by veterans of Zimbabwe's war against Rhodesian rule. Since February thousands of squatters have invaded 800 white-owned farms, claiming that they are taking back land that was stolen from their ancestors by Rhodesian colonialists. There is considerable evidence that President Robert Mu gabe's government organised the farm invasions. Mr Mugabe himself enthusiastically supports the squatters and has disobeyed a court order to have the illegal squatters evicted. It appears that Mr Mugabe is attempting to win the votes of rural blacks.</p> <p>The uneasy standoff between the white farmers and squatters has become more heated as Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections approach.

      "bodyText": "Tensions have risen further in Zimbabwe with the news that a policeman was shot dead yesterday, apparently by squatters resisting arrest for beating a white farmer. Police were arresting several squatters for allegedly assaulting farmer Ian Kay when a fracas broke out and shots were fired. A police spokesman, Bothwell Mugariri, confirmed that a constable died, but gave no other details. Mr Kay was severely assaulted on Monday by about 25 squatters on his farm near Marondera, 75 miles east of Harare. The squatters bound Mr Kay's wrists with wire, whipped him across the back and beat his head. He was hospitalised in Marondera and was expected to be released late yesterday. The squatters are led by veterans of Zimbabwe's war against Rhodesian rule. Since February thousands of squatters have invaded 800 white-owned farms, claiming that they are taking back land that was stolen from their ancestors by Rhodesian colonialists. There is considerable evidence that President Robert Mu gabe's government organised the farm invasions. Mr Mugabe himself enthusiastically supports the squatters and has disobeyed a court order to have the illegal squatters evicted. It appears that Mr Mugabe is attempting to win the votes of rural blacks. The uneasy standoff between the white farmers and squatters has become more heated as Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections approach. Support is growing throughout the country for the new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). In response Mr Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party have threatened the country with violence. Mr Kay was reportedly attacked by the squatters because he supports the MDC and has held rallies on his farm. On other farms in Zimbabwe, squatters have become more aggressive, smashing into houses, seizing guns and threatening farmers and their workers. Last week the head of the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents the white landowners, was warned by top government officials that farmers would meet with violence unless they stopped all support for the MDC. But many farmers have rejected the government pressure. In the wake of the beating of Mr Kay, many white farmers warn that they must protect themselves, with arms if necessary. Violent incidents between the white farmers and the black squatters could quickly spill out of control. Support for the MDC has grown, among blacks as well as whites, as people blame Mr Mugabe for economic mismanagement, corruption, fuel shortages, human rights abuses and the illegal farm invasions. Faced with rising support for the MDC, Mr Mugabe's government has responded with violence. Two MDC members have been killed in the past week in clashes with supporters of Zanu-PF. Over the weekend a multiracial peace march by 4,000 opposition supporters in Harare was attacked by 150 supporters of Mr Mugabe. Armed with clubs, iron bars, bricks and rocks, the Zanu-PF supporters beat the peaceful marchers, injuring 15. One man was beaten unconscious and remains in intensive care. The shooting yesterday of the police constable is expected to further inflame racial and political tensions. Mr Mugabe has not yet announced the date for the parliamentary elections, but on Monday he told the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, in Cairo that the polls would be held in mid-May. Confronted by a rapidly declining economy, falling living standards and waning support, Mr Mugabe has pushed Zimbabwe towards political confrontation. Some analysts suggest that Mr Mugabe will use the chaos he is creating as an excuse to declare a state of emergency. He would then be able to assume sweeping powers and avoid holding elections.",

      "body": "<p>\"The world needs a big bank\", is the mantra from Barclays in a swish new advertising campaign led by film stars such as Sir Anthony Hopkins and Nick Moran. </p> <p>In Britain, though, millions of Barclays customers might begin to believe that the message should be \"small is beautiful\", as the bank prepares to close 172 branches. </p> <p>The move, which will leave many rural communities without a bank on the high street, continues the inexorable decline in the British financial sector. In the last 10 years more than 6,000 branches have disappeared as a result of takeovers, and amid pressure to reduce costs to please the banks' shareholders. </p> <p>Yet Barclays has attracted more flak than its rivals - who have closed down many more branches. Its managers believe this is because it has become the \"last bank in town\". In some instances it might also be the last of the \"great British institutions\", as supermarkets and many other familiar high street names desert towns and villages for new, more cost-efficient \"out of town\" complexes. </p> <p>\"We have stayed longer than any one else,\" a Barclays spokesman said yesterday. Indeed, when Barclays unveiled the plans to close the branches and cut 6,000 jobs in a bid to reduce its costs, the City welcomed the move after criticising it for being slower than its rivals to take action. </p> <p>Its rivals also believe that Barclays has done itself few favours. The cuts come during a turbulent period for the bank.

      "bodyText": "\"The world needs a big bank\", is the mantra from Barclays in a swish new advertising campaign led by film stars such as Sir Anthony Hopkins and Nick Moran. In Britain, though, millions of Barclays customers might begin to believe that the message should be \"small is beautiful\", as the bank prepares to close 172 branches. The move, which will leave many rural communities without a bank on the high street, continues the inexorable decline in the British financial sector. In the last 10 years more than 6,000 branches have disappeared as a result of takeovers, and amid pressure to reduce costs to please the banks' shareholders. Yet Barclays has attracted more flak than its rivals - who have closed down many more branches. Its managers believe this is because it has become the \"last bank in town\". In some instances it might also be the last of the \"great British institutions\", as supermarkets and many other familiar high street names desert towns and villages for new, more cost-efficient \"out of town\" complexes. \"We have stayed longer than any one else,\" a Barclays spokesman said yesterday. Indeed, when Barclays unveiled the plans to close the branches and cut 6,000 jobs in a bid to reduce its costs, the City welcomed the move after criticising it for being slower than its rivals to take action. Its rivals also believe that Barclays has done itself few favours. The cuts come during a turbulent period for the bank. Last year, it incensed the industry with moves to charge for withdrawals from cash machines over the Link network. That episode followed an embarrassing search for a chief executive after a boardroom row that led to the resignation of the old Etonian, Martin Taylor. His initial replacement lasted just one day in the new job after it was discovered that he had a heart condition. Things got worse when the new chief executive, the Irish-Canadian, Matthew Barrett, was embroiled in controversies about a lucrative pay deal and over his estranged wife. Barclays privately admits that these incidents have been damaging. A spokesman said: \"The number of high-profile issues in which we are involved are inter-related and reflect rapidly changing forces in the industry brought about by the customer.\" The bank argues that it has a real economic case for the branch closures, which are based on \"changing customer demand\". It cites a move by customers away from using branches for basic transactions and towards using the telephone, cash machines and the internet for basic banking needs. Last week alone 20,000 of its 13m customers registered for internet banking. Tim Sweeney, director general of the British Bankers' Association, the industry's lobby group, has argued against nostalgia for a \"golden age\", when banks, along with churches and pubs were a \"pillar of our national social life\". The banks believe that branch closures are a result of the changing nature of society in Britain driven by technological changes. The cruel realities of the financial world mean that the banks cannot afford to keep \"unprofitable\" branches open if they are to appease their shareholders, many of whom are ordinary men and women who invest indirectly in the shares by way of their pension schemes. The banks argue that competition for customers means that people can now get access to their cash and financial services more easily than ever - through cash machines on filling station forecourts and \"cashbacks\" in supermarkets - and get advice by picking up the telephone or logging on to the internet at any time of the day or the night. But this argument is unlikely to satisfy critics of Barclays, who insist that branch closures most hurt Britain's least well-off and elderly citizens, who may be more reluctant to pick-up the telephone or log on to the internet.",

Now many will find that while it is easy to buy shares in small, illiquid companies when prices are rising, it is all but impossible to sell them when prices are falling.</p> <p>So is the new economy yesterday's stuff? No. In fact, now is probably the time at least to consider laying a bet on the opposite being the case. The divergence in the real economy between those companies which apply technology to increase their productivity and those that just hope the so-called internet bubble has burst will continue to grow.</p> <p><b> Cause to pause </b><br></p> <p>On the face of it, the febrile state of the world's post-Microsoft stock markets makes life even more complicated for the Bank of England's monetary policy committee as it starts its two-day monthly meeting today. This was always going to be a tough call - perhaps the toughest decision the MPC has had in its brief life - and financial turmoil merely adds to the mass of conflicting signals.</p> <p>The reality is, however, that the events of the past two days have made a rate rise in the UK slightly less probable and might just have tipped the balance in favour of no change this month. It is far too early, of course, to say that dot.com has turned into dot.bomb, but the Bank will probably want the dust to settle before it takes actions it might regret later. That would certainly be the wisest course of action.</p> <p>All the signs of anxiety were there when Eddie George broke the customary pre-MPC purdah to speak to the annual meeting of the British Chambers of Commerce. Noting that the pressures on some manufacturers as a result of the strong pound were \"excessive\", the governor said that there was not an awful lot he and the other eight members of the MPC could do about it.</p> <p>Mr George frankly admitted that were he a farmer, a steelmaker, a motor manufacturer or even a hotel owner he would be sorely tempted to be calling for lower interest rates, in the hope that the result would be a cheaper currency. However, Mr George is not an indust rialist and never has been. He is a career central banker who believes that cutting borrowing costs now would merely stoke inflationary pressure in the already over-strong domestic economy, leading to greater pain all round. House prices are rising at 15% a year, earnings growth is 5.9%, consumer demand is expanding by 4.5% a year. Mr George remembers where this all ended in 1988 and has no desire to sit through a repeat.</p> <p>However, the combination of the four previous increases in interest rates and the strength of the pound means that monetary policy has already been tightened considerably since the autumn. At a time when Britain has the lowest inflation rate in Europe and BMW has just pulled the plug on Rover, the Bank may be looking for a reason to put off what would be a politically explosive decision for a month. The shenanigans on Wall Street last night suggest it need look no further.</p>",

Now many will find that while it is easy to buy shares in small, illiquid companies when prices are rising, it is all but impossible to sell them when prices are falling. So is the new economy yesterday's stuff? No. In fact, now is probably the time at least to consider laying a bet on the opposite being the case. The divergence in the real economy between those companies which apply technology to increase their productivity and those that just hope the so-called internet bubble has burst will continue to grow. Cause to pause On the face of it, the febrile state of the world's post-Microsoft stock markets makes life even more complicated for the Bank of England's monetary policy committee as it starts its two-day monthly meeting today. This was always going to be a tough call - perhaps the toughest decision the MPC has had in its brief life - and financial turmoil merely adds to the mass of conflicting signals. The reality is, however, that the events of the past two days have made a rate rise in the UK slightly less probable and might just have tipped the balance in favour of no change this month. It is far too early, of course, to say that dot.com has turned into dot.bomb, but the Bank will probably want the dust to settle before it takes actions it might regret later. That would certainly be the wisest course of action. All the signs of anxiety were there when Eddie George broke the customary pre-MPC purdah to speak to the annual meeting of the British Chambers of Commerce. Noting that the pressures on some manufacturers as a result of the strong pound were \"excessive\", the governor said that there was not an awful lot he and the other eight members of the MPC could do about it. Mr George frankly admitted that were he a farmer, a steelmaker, a motor manufacturer or even a hotel owner he would be sorely tempted to be calling for lower interest rates, in the hope that the result would be a cheaper currency. However, Mr George is not an indust rialist and never has been. He is a career central banker who believes that cutting borrowing costs now would merely stoke inflationary pressure in the already over-strong domestic economy, leading to greater pain all round. House prices are rising at 15% a year, earnings growth is 5.9%, consumer demand is expanding by 4.5% a year. Mr George remembers where this all ended in 1988 and has no desire to sit through a repeat. However, the combination of the four previous increases in interest rates and the strength of the pound means that monetary policy has already been tightened considerably since the autumn. At a time when Britain has the lowest inflation rate in Europe and BMW has just pulled the plug on Rover, the Bank may be looking for a reason to put off what would be a politically explosive decision for a month. The shenanigans on Wall Street last night suggest it need look no further.",

      "body": "<p>Karl Marx always said capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction - but perhaps it contains the seeds of its own salvation, too. Is that too optimistic a reading of Monday night's US court ruling against the computer behemoth Microsoft? Maybe. But it is a tempting one. </p> <p>For in the most capitalist nation in the world, a judge nominated by the most conservative president in living memory has plunged an arrow into the corporate beast. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, a free-marketeer appointed to the United States District Court by Ronald Reagan in the go-go 1980s, has achieved in an instant what leftwing activists have dreamed of for years. He has branded one of global capital's biggest players a corporate lawbreaker, a bully which abused its monopoly power to stifle creativity and innovation in an industry which relies on those qualities for its survival. He lambasted Microsoft for keeping \"an oppressive thumb\" on the computer software market, forcefeeding consumers Microsoft's operating system, Windows, and then its internet browser, Explorer. These were not the words of some crunchy, eco-warrior shaking his fist at the big boys of Seattle: this was the measured judgment of an American judge, administering American law. </p> <p>It could not be more important - or more heartening. For what Judge Jackson has done is place a limit on corporate power. He has drawn a line and told mega-capitalism, \"This far and no further.\" That counts as a blow not just against boardroom greed - but against the twin diseases of our globalised era, fatalism and passivity. By his ruling, the judge has reaffirmed the power of consumers and citizens. He has reminded us that, even in a world dominated by economics and market forces, politics - and the law - still matter. </p> <p>It could not have come at a better time. Defeatism in the face of the market is rife just now, especially in Britain. We watch the 50,000 workers of the west Midlands facing redundancy thanks to BMW's sell-off of Rover, and we feel powerless. People want the government to do something, but few know what. Most of the current demands amount to requests to soften the blow. </p> <p>We see Barclays close up to 4,000 bank branches, thereby stranding rural communities across Britain, and we feel just as impotent. Chris Mullin, a junior minister, gamely suggests a boycott. It's a good idea - but few of us are convinced it will make much difference. Whether it's Barclays or BMW, we feel the market has an iron logic and it would be quixotic, Scargillite madness to buck it. </p> <p>Not now. Judge Jackson, with the help of the US statute book, has proved capitalism need not run wild: it can be tamed. He has not had to craft some new, interventionist ideal from the bench. Instead he has simply enforced America's anti-trust (or anti-monopoly) laws. These are the same rules which in 1911 took one look at John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil - which by then had gobbled up 90% of the American petroleum industry - and demanded the company break up. In 1984 it was AT&amp;T's domination of the telephone market which fell on the wrong side of the anti-trust rules. \"You're getting too big,\" said the law. \"It's time to break up.\" If Judge Jackson's ruling is not overturned on appeal, he may well end up prescribing the same medicine to Bill Gates. </p> <p>Is it just America that boasts this protection against excessive capitalism? Does it work like a vaccine, so that a nation where capitalism coarses through the collective bloodstream is somehow uniquely protected against its ill effects? Not necessarily. The European Union cannot claim the scalps won by America's anti-trust laws, but Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome are darts that can be fired at corporate bullies who try to choke competition.

      "bodyText": "Karl Marx always said capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction - but perhaps it contains the seeds of its own salvation, too. Is that too optimistic a reading of Monday night's US court ruling against the computer behemoth Microsoft? Maybe. But it is a tempting one. For in the most capitalist nation in the world, a judge nominated by the most conservative president in living memory has plunged an arrow into the corporate beast. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, a free-marketeer appointed to the United States District Court by Ronald Reagan in the go-go 1980s, has achieved in an instant what leftwing activists have dreamed of for years. He has branded one of global capital's biggest players a corporate lawbreaker, a bully which abused its monopoly power to stifle creativity and innovation in an industry which relies on those qualities for its survival. He lambasted Microsoft for keeping \"an oppressive thumb\" on the computer software market, forcefeeding consumers Microsoft's operating system, Windows, and then its internet browser, Explorer. These were not the words of some crunchy, eco-warrior shaking his fist at the big boys of Seattle: this was the measured judgment of an American judge, administering American law. It could not be more important - or more heartening. For what Judge Jackson has done is place a limit on corporate power. He has drawn a line and told mega-capitalism, \"This far and no further.\" That counts as a blow not just against boardroom greed - but against the twin diseases of our globalised era, fatalism and passivity. By his ruling, the judge has reaffirmed the power of consumers and citizens. He has reminded us that, even in a world dominated by economics and market forces, politics - and the law - still matter. It could not have come at a better time. Defeatism in the face of the market is rife just now, especially in Britain. We watch the 50,000 workers of the west Midlands facing redundancy thanks to BMW's sell-off of Rover, and we feel powerless. People want the government to do something, but few know what. Most of the current demands amount to requests to soften the blow. We see Barclays close up to 4,000 bank branches, thereby stranding rural communities across Britain, and we feel just as impotent. Chris Mullin, a junior minister, gamely suggests a boycott. It's a good idea - but few of us are convinced it will make much difference. Whether it's Barclays or BMW, we feel the market has an iron logic and it would be quixotic, Scargillite madness to buck it. Not now. Judge Jackson, with the help of the US statute book, has proved capitalism need not run wild: it can be tamed. He has not had to craft some new, interventionist ideal from the bench. Instead he has simply enforced America's anti-trust (or anti-monopoly) laws. These are the same rules which in 1911 took one look at John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil - which by then had gobbled up 90% of the American petroleum industry - and demanded the company break up. In 1984 it was AT&amp;T's domination of the telephone market which fell on the wrong side of the anti-trust rules. \"You're getting too big,\" said the law. \"It's time to break up.\" If Judge Jackson's ruling is not overturned on appeal, he may well end up prescribing the same medicine to Bill Gates. Is it just America that boasts this protection against excessive capitalism? Does it work like a vaccine, so that a nation where capitalism coarses through the collective bloodstream is somehow uniquely protected against its ill effects? Not necessarily. The European Union cannot claim the scalps won by America's anti-trust laws, but Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome are darts that can be fired at corporate bullies who try to choke competition. In 1997 Brussels struck out at Boeing whose $14bn merger with McDonnell Douglas would have handed them a virtual monopoly in the world market for aircraft. The merger went ahead, but only after Europe had attached some useful strings. The continent's arsenal may not be as mighty as America's antitrust law, but it does exist.

      "bodyText": "Hooray to Madeleine Bunting (An eternal struggle, April 3) for encouraging a redressing of the balance between education and training and between work and leisure. But surely the situation is more serious than she suggests. The instrumental approach which concerns her is shortsighted, not only in undervaluing the private in favour of the public, but underestimating the dangers to society as a whole and to economic success. The dichotomy is not that clearcut. Whilst basic skills of numeracy and literacy are crucial, an educational experience which deprives our youngsters of opportunities to develop their creative and critical skills will not only sell them short but disable employers across the spectrum, who increasingly will be dependent on people who can learn and think in the fast-moving world of the \"information revolution\". This is not just a matter for the academically inclined. The need for all to be able to learn new skills and work in new cultures is already obvious. The \"lifelong learning\" agenda will be doomed if the early years are dominated by a procrustean approach informed only by a narrow minded and ill-informed view of current urgent and specific skills shortages.

Some libertarian economists ask: why worry? Technological monopolies have short lives; upstart companies always undermine them (as Microsoft did with IBM). Even the revered guru Peter Drucker points out that no non-governmental monopoly in history has lasted longer than 15 years. But this ignores two points. First, why should companies be allowed to enjoy monopoly profits - ie money that should have gone to the consumer - even for 15 years? Second, companies like Microsoft, having done it themselves, are learning from the mistakes of the past. Nearly five years ago Microsoft saw a start-up called Netscape in its rear view mirror, which quickly captured an 80% share of the market for internet \"browsers\". It responded by bundling its own (bought-in) browser with its operating system - the main point at issue in this case - and all but snuffed Netscape out. Microsoft now has nearly 80% of the browser market. </p> <p>Judge Jackson has the difficult choice of either deconstructing Microsoft into smaller competing units or insisting on good behaviour. He should go for the tougher structural solution. Microsoft can't be relied on to change its ways. It deeply believes that it has done nothing wrong (monopolists are notoriously myopic) and has such a fierce business culture that to ask it to change would be like appealing to a tiger to behave like a pussy cat. The key is to try to preserve the one positive thing that has come out of the monopoly situation - a common world standard for computers - while shedding the bad effects of stifling competition and innovation. There is no intrinsic reason why a browser or a spreadsheet has to be bundled in with an operating system. Who would dare launch a new browser now to compete with the one Microsoft gives away \"free\" with its operating system (on which it earns monopoly profits)? Operating systems should be constructed to take all sorts of competing software, and if they can't then they should be regulated like a utility. Microsoft often boasts of its innovation but most of its strengths (including its Excel spreadsheet and the operating system itself) originated outside the company. If Microsoft were broken up into competing units it would not only be good for consumers and Microsoft - whose huge reservoir of skilled people could be unleashed on other activities - but also for the computer industry, whose creative energies have been held back by the long shadow of Microsoft's dominance. When AT&amp;T's telephone monopoly was broken in the 1980s, it led to the highly successful \"Baby Bells\". History can be repeated.</p>",

But his contribution leaves unanswered an important question: will he provide the political leadership needed to translate good principles into action?</p> <p>Later this month, at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, the world's governments have a real opportunity to tackle the crisis in global education. As the prime minister says, this crisis is at the heart of global poverty and inequality. Unfortunately, the opportunity provided by the Dakar conference is under threat, thanks to inept leadership. The draft plan of action now under consideration is little more than a shopping list of vague principles devoid of anything meriting the term \"action\". It contains no new commitments on mobilising the financial resources needed to achieve universal primary education by the target date of 2015.</p> <p>Tony Blair should provide the political leadership needed to drag the Dakar conference out of the mire into which the UN and northern governments are leading it.</p> <p>At present no G8 leaders are attending the event. If he were to participate and throw his weight behind calls for a decisive plan of action, it could transform Dakar from a talking shop into a springboard for action. <br><b>Kevin Watkins</b><br>Senior policy advisor, Oxfam</p> <p>\u0095 Tony Blair says that education is our strongest weapon against global poverty. Your front page (Scandal of the food Britain throws away, April 4) shows how the big supermarkets are throwing away more food than poor countries can produce.</p> <p>If further large-scale supermarket developments were stopped and people had more access to local shops, if vouchers were stopped and people had more income to buy healthy food, if worldwide weapons industries were stopped and poor countries had more control of their own economies ... If education started nearer to home?<br><b>John Nicholson</b><br>Chief executive, UK Public Health Association<br>john@ukpha.org.uk</p> <p>\u0095 Tony Blair's defence of his \"policies\" regarding making education available to 130m children around the world fails to convince.</p> <p>He says developing countries \"need to give increased priority to primary and basic education\". Many countries do give it a high priority but thanks to \"aid\" programmes and the \"development\" banks, they have been obliged to spend money on debt repayment, arms, dams, etc, rather than on education. Britain profits hugely from the various \"aid\" packages that take money away from education. Local leadership in many countries have been arguing for education spending but have been obliged to turn away, to service their debts.<br><b>Amal Chatterjee</b><br>University of Glasgow<br> akc@arts.gla.ac.uk</p> <p>\u0095 Your section on the right to education gives a vivid picture of the acute problems around the world and some encouraging examples of what is being done about it. The footnote on \"What you can do to help\" is a letdown.</p> <p>The whole emphasis is on applying pressure to Tony Blair and raising money. Surely the starting point must be the people of the countries concerned finding their own solutions. There is a valuable role for charities and government but they should support such people, not tell them what to do. Would that not be colonialism reborn?<br><b> George Wolfe</b><br>Calver, Derbyshire<br> GeoWolfe@aol.com</p>",

      "bodyText": "We welcome the fact that Tony Blair's passion for education goes beyond our national borders (We must not let our children down, April 4). But his contribution leaves unanswered an important question: will he provide the political leadership needed to translate good principles into action? Later this month, at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, the world's governments have a real opportunity to tackle the crisis in global education. As the prime minister says, this crisis is at the heart of global poverty and inequality. Unfortunately, the opportunity provided by the Dakar conference is under threat, thanks to inept leadership. The draft plan of action now under consideration is little more than a shopping list of vague principles devoid of anything meriting the term \"action\". It contains no new commitments on mobilising the financial resources needed to achieve universal primary education by the target date of 2015. Tony Blair should provide the political leadership needed to drag the Dakar conference out of the mire into which the UN and northern governments are leading it. At present no G8 leaders are attending the event. If he were to participate and throw his weight behind calls for a decisive plan of action, it could transform Dakar from a talking shop into a springboard for action. Kevin Watkins Senior policy advisor, Oxfam \u0095 Tony Blair says that education is our strongest weapon against global poverty. Your front page (Scandal of the food Britain throws away, April 4) shows how the big supermarkets are throwing away more food than poor countries can produce. If further large-scale supermarket developments were stopped and people had more access to local shops, if vouchers were stopped and people had more income to buy healthy food, if worldwide weapons industries were stopped and poor countries had more control of their own economies ... If education started nearer to home? John Nicholson Chief executive, UK Public Health Association john@ukpha.org.uk \u0095 Tony Blair's defence of his \"policies\" regarding making education available to 130m children around the world fails to convince. He says developing countries \"need to give increased priority to primary and basic education\". Many countries do give it a high priority but thanks to \"aid\" programmes and the \"development\" banks, they have been obliged to spend money on debt repayment, arms, dams, etc, rather than on education. Britain profits hugely from the various \"aid\" packages that take money away from education. Local leadership in many countries have been arguing for education spending but have been obliged to turn away, to service their debts. Amal Chatterjee University of Glasgow akc@arts.gla.ac.uk \u0095 Your section on the right to education gives a vivid picture of the acute problems around the world and some encouraging examples of what is being done about it. The footnote on \"What you can do to help\" is a letdown. The whole emphasis is on applying pressure to Tony Blair and raising money. Surely the starting point must be the people of the countries concerned finding their own solutions. There is a valuable role for charities and government but they should support such people, not tell them what to do. Would that not be colonialism reborn?

The original showed a baby holding a syringe and gripping with his teeth a cord that was wrapped around his arm.</p> <p>The text read: \"John Donaldson. Age 23. Battered as a child, it was always possible that John would turn to drugs. With Barnardo's help, child abuse need not lead to an empty future.\"</p> <p>The ASA said: \"Because the advertisers used the image to raise awareness of the seriousness of drug abuse and the action that could be taken to prevent it, the advertisement was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence or undue distress.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Virgin yesterday withdrew an advert for a video game judged by the ASA to incite violence against pedestrians.

      "bodyText": "Barnardo's, the children's charity, was justified in using the \"stark image\" of a baby injecting heroin to drive home its role as a safe haven, the Advertising Standards Authority said yesterday. Rejecting 28 complaints attacking the newspaper campaign as shocking and offensive, the ASA said it was obvious that Barnardo's had tried to convey a \"serious and important message\". When the advert appeared in January, the Committee of Advertising Practice, the industry body which writes the code administered by the ASA, asked publications not to use it. Barnardo's marketing director, Andre Nebel, called this response \"ill-considered and over-hasty\". \"We are a charity trying to raise awareness of our work aimed at creating better futures for children and young people threatened by disadvantage, abuse and neglect. This message is clearly reflected in our advertising.\" Most newspapers, including the Guardian, ran the advert, but in the face of protest Barnardo's replaced the image with one of a happier baby. The original showed a baby holding a syringe and gripping with his teeth a cord that was wrapped around his arm. The text read: \"John Donaldson. Age 23. Battered as a child, it was always possible that John would turn to drugs. With Barnardo's help, child abuse need not lead to an empty future.\" The ASA said: \"Because the advertisers used the image to raise awareness of the seriousness of drug abuse and the action that could be taken to prevent it, the advertisement was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence or undue distress.\" \u0095 Virgin yesterday withdrew an advert for a video game judged by the ASA to incite violence against pedestrians. The poster for Carmageddon featured a naked bottom with the words \"Pedestrians. Kiss yours goodbye\", and underneath: \"Puts the car into carnage\" with \"carnage\" dripping in red. Virgin Interactive Entertainment said the advert was humorous but apologised for any offence caused.",

The government's official position, given by Helen Liddell, the trade and industry minister, is that BNFL got the contract because of its expertise in clearing up nuclear waste and decommissioning. The scheme to develop new nuclear weapons has not been announced by the government, which is under pressure to reduce weaponry under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Also among the papers is the programme \"to ensure safe, secure and reliable stockpile\" of nuclear weapons by next month. The work plan details the need for new partnerships with universities and secondment and swaps of staff with French and American nuclear weapons laboratories. The plan also involves assessing the skills of Aldermaston employees to make sure enough experts are retained who are capable of designing new nuclear weapons. The documents make it clear that Aldermaston is still dismantling warheads from the now defunct Polaris fleet and hopes to develop a plan for dealing with them by next month. The government's plans to save money on nuclear weapons partly involve cutting the workforce at Aldermaston and Burghfield by 1,400 from 4,500.

The Channel Express plane, piloted by Martin Bulgin, of Corfe Mullen, Dorset, and co-pilot Ian Rhodes, 41, of Swindon, crashed in January 1999. Wembley attack: man for trial Jonathan Edmonds, 31, of Slough, yesterday elected to stand trial accused of attacking Ruth Lelacheur, 30, at the Leicester City-Tottenham Hotspur Worthington Cup final at Wembley in March.

She added: \"We expected Jack Straw to show some understanding but this shows that he is not capable of it.\"</p> <p>Shah, an illiterate Muslim from Mirpur in Pakistan, arrived in England in the mid-1970s and had an arranged marriage which broke up in 1980.</p> <p>She was convicted at Leeds crown court in December 1993 of killing Azam, a heroin-dealing Bradford businessman whom she met after her husband left.</p> <p>During the trial Shah, 49, did not mention the abuse she had suffered.

      "bodyText": "A woman who poisoned a man with arsenic after allegedly suffering repeated sexual and physical abuse could be released on parole in four years following a decision to reduce her life imprisonment tariff, it emerged yesterday. Zoora Shah, who was convicted of murdering Mohammed Azam in 1993, received papers from the home secretary, Jack Straw, saying her tariff had been cut from 20 years to 12. It means she will be eligible for parole in 2004. Shah's eldest daughter, Naseem, whose campaign for her mother's release is a cause celebre in Britain's Asian community, welcomed the decision but said a 12-year tariff was still \"a farce\". She added: \"We expected Jack Straw to show some understanding but this shows that he is not capable of it.\" Shah, an illiterate Muslim from Mirpur in Pakistan, arrived in England in the mid-1970s and had an arranged marriage which broke up in 1980. She was convicted at Leeds crown court in December 1993 of killing Azam, a heroin-dealing Bradford businessman whom she met after her husband left. During the trial Shah, 49, did not mention the abuse she had suffered. She said later she did not want to bring shame on her family. But during an appeal against her conviction, which was lost, she admitted twice poisoning Azam with arsenic because he had physically and sexually abused her. Shah said she agreed to have sex with Azam in return for his finding her a home. She alleged that in 1982 he asked her to bring drugs back from Pakistan and that he was violent when she returned empty handed. She said she was beaten, raped and \"used as a bed\" by him for 12 years. When Azam was jailed for drug offences in 1984, he allegedly encouraged associates to visit her for sex. Shah said she tried to hire a hitman to kill him but had to take matters into her own hands when he took a sexual interest in her two teenage daughters. To begin with, she laced a samosa with arsenic in the hope it would reduce his sex drive. Although Azam was ill for a month he continued to abuse her, so she spiked a sweet and fed it to him at a family gathering. He died the next day. In May 1998 the court of appeal was suspicious of Shah's fresh evidence, asking why no one seemed to have noticed a single bruise other than one black eye. Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Butterfield and Mr Justice Richards, said he was surprised Shah felt unable to inform anyone. Naseem Shah said the appeal judges had failed to understand the cultural issues involved. Hannana Siddiqui, of the campaign group Southall Black Sisters, said yesterday: \"It is an indictment of our times that the criminal justice system still cannot distinguish between those who kill from a position of power and those who do so out of despair.\" The Home Office stressed there was no guarantee Shah would be paroled in four years. \"The tariff is the bare minimum she will have to serve before she is eligible for parole,\" a spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "A husband bludgeoned his estranged wife's lover to death with a hammer and then shot himself after confronting the pair in the grounds of a country hotel, Sussex police said yesterday. The double killing in the grounds of Effingham Park Hotel in Copthorne, West Susex, happened late on Monday night following what is thought to have been a row between the husband and his wife's lover. Residents near the scene of the killing described how they were woken during the night by \"the most appalling screaming\" and the sound of someone being repeatedly clubbed. The killings took place around 11pm when a 55-year-old man confronted his wife and her lover, a hotel maintenance worker, as they got out of the man's car in the hotel's staff car park. A spokesman for Sussex police said: \"We believe he [the husband] hit him on the head with a hammer, and then it looks like he did himself in.\" The maintenance worker survived the intial beating and managed to stumble into the staff quarters of the hotel after the attack but collapsed despite attempts by staff to help him. He later died on his way to New East Surrey hospital in Redhill. According to Sussex police, the wife watched in horror as her husband attacked the hotel worker, but she was uninjured in the attack. A police spokesman was unable to say whether the woman had intervened in the struggle between the two men. She was yesterday being interviewed by police and her children were being looked after by friends. Her husband's body was found two hours later by police sniffer dogs 100 yeards from the main hotel building on the hotel golf course, where he had apparently shot himself in the head. All three are from Felbridge, a village five miles from Copthorne. The dead maintenance worker lived at the hotel and moved into the staff quarters at Chapel Lane, a quarter of a mile from the hotel, around six months ago. Nigel Mather, the deputy manager of the hotel, said yesterday: \"We are all in shock and our deepest sympathies go to the families of those involved. We do not know how the incident occurred.\" Hotel staff were yesterday still being interviewed by the police. The staff building where the attack took place is set back from the hotel in a wooded area and cannot be seen by hotel guests, many of whom were milling around the bar at the time of the attack, a hotel employee said. The four-star hotel is part of the Copthorne Hotels chain and is popular with business people and holidaymakers, and flight crews from nearby Gatwick airport. Diana Rummey, 51, a teacher who lives next door to the hotel's staff quarters, said she was woken in the night by \"the most appalling screaming\". She said: \"Someone was in serious trouble, they were really loud, terrified screams. In between the screaming, there was someone actually being hit.\" Mrs Rummey added: \"It then went quiet for a minute and as I was about to ring for an ambulance I saw the flashing lights from my bedroom window.\" Mrs Rummey said the hotel staff were good neighbours. \"They sometimes play loud music and because they do shift work they are constantly going backwards and forwards.

      "bodyText": "When Entrust - the country's only privately owned and run regulatory body - was set up in 1996 it was given responsibility to police cash handed over to non-profit making environmental trusts for activities relating to \"a tightly drawn list of approved purposes approved by government\", according to the badly worded Department of Environment press release at the time. The press release emphasised that the trusts had to be \"at arm's length from the landfill operators who contribute to them\". What was not expected was that the regulatory body, which is now responsible for \u00a3250m donated by the landfill operators, and approves and audits 1,900 bodies, would be so dominated by the industry. The company is chaired by Lord Cranbook, chairman of the environment advisory board of the Shanks Group, one of the country's largest waste disposal companies. The board secretary is Roger Hewitt, former chief executive of Shanks and McEwen before it became the Shanks Group, and treasurer of the Institute of Waste Management. A third non-executive director is Peter Neill, chief executive of the Environment Services Association, which is the trade body of the waste industry, and chief executive of Lancashire Waste Services. Marion Carter, an independent environment consultant, is a member of ESA's board and was a consultant to its environmental body, Esart. Her firm advised Esart on how to spend research money donated by landfill operators. The other five members of the board include one council leader, an accountant, lawyer, a professor of environmental science and an independent environment consultant. Until the Guardian began its investigation a year ago, Entrust had only audited one of the 800 environmental trusts which had received cash . Since then it has started auditing 200 organisations. Already four have had their grant money revoked and two are under investigation by the serious fraud office.",

Wayne Richards, 17, was killed last Friday morning on Woodbury Common, Devon. An investigation into the shooting is being led by Devon and Cornwall police, in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence. A Devon and Cornwall police source said last night that the shooting happened when the recruits were sitting in a depression on the common. \"The instructors attacked them and threw a couple of thunder flashes into the hole. \"One of the instructors had a magazine loaded with live rounds and opened fire,\" the police source added. Mr Richards was hit in the sternum, and the bullet ricocheted under his chin, and through his jaw and head, said the police source. When asked about the claim that an instructor had live rounds, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"The investigation into the incident is still continuing. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.\" The marines, who have given no details of the weapon involved, described the incident as a \"tragic accident\". It is understood the police investigation is focusing on how live and blank rounds were mixed up during the training exercise. Richards, from Cwm Avon in the Swansea valley, was in the ninth week of a 30-week course to qualify for the coveted green beret. He was exercising with the 780 troop from the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, a riverside base a few miles from Woodbury Common which is regularly used by the marines for training exercises. On the day of the shooting, Chief Superintendent Liam McGrath said that live ammunition was carried by the marines against the threat of terrorism. \"Clearly any further detail as to why live ammunition was involved in this incident is the subject of our inquiry,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair faced embarrassment yesterday when a cabinet colleague admitted that the prime minister's flagship initiative to modernise the government had proved a flop.</p> <p>In a rare admission of failure by Labour, the treasury chief secretary Andrew Smith said that hundreds of targets imposed on every Whitehall department had created \"shortcomings\" that had hindered the government's performance. The system is to be radically overhauled in the coming months.</p> <p>Mr Smith's remarks were the most candid admission by the government that Mr Blair's much vaunted \"public service agreements\" had proved cumbersome and inoperable.</p> <p>Unveiled amid fanfare in 1998 at the same time as the first spending round, the agreements were designed to improve the performance of departments through targets; Gordon Brown threatened to cut departmental budgets if they did not meet them.</p> <p>With negotiations intensifying in the run-up to the chancellor's second spending round in July, Mr Brown's deputy admitted yesterday that the first set had proved over-ambitious.</p> <p>\"The radical nature of [the agreements] and their immediate impact on departments inevitably led to shortcomings,\" Mr Smith said in a speech to the Blairite think tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research. \"Some of our targets are simply not very good, because we were new to the business.\"</p> <p>He acknowledged ministers had been high-handed in forcing each department to reduce sickness levels among staff. \"Our emphasis on the serious issue of sickness absence in the public sector looks unabalanced when we didn't have comparable measures in other areas of people management,\" said an astonishingly frank Mr Smith.</p> <p>The government also had been mistaken in attempting to set an example to business by paying all invoices on time. \"Setting targets to achieve 100% prompt payment of invoices looks good but will often be unachievable for very sound reasons, if an invoice needs to be investigated,\" he said.</p> <p>In a clear sign of ministerial alarm at the targets' failure, Mr Smith said that the system would be radically changed in July: instead of an average of 30 targets per department, the Mr Brown would set an average of 10: \"The current spending review is a big opportunity to improve the [system] and learn from experience, both positive and negative, as we take them forward.\"</p> <p>Mr Smith's admission was seized on by Labour's opponents. Only last month, in the Budget, the chancellor had said that billions of extra money to be pumped into health and education would be linked to \"modernisation targets\".</p> <p>Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, said last night: \"The targets are political, and the money is drip-fed according to ministers' judgments on who is behaving well. No wonder people cannot plan and manage on that basis.</p> <p>\"It is the height of hypocrisy for Labour leaders to lecture hard working men and women in the public and private sectors about improving their performance when minister cannot even set coherent, workable targets.\"</p> <p>John Garrett, a former Labour MP, rounded on the targets in a Guardian article last year that was praised by Mr Smith. Mr Garrett welcomed the admission and said: \"Public service agreements aim to confuse by swamping people with information. I would like to see them simplified and made more meaningful.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair faced embarrassment yesterday when a cabinet colleague admitted that the prime minister's flagship initiative to modernise the government had proved a flop. In a rare admission of failure by Labour, the treasury chief secretary Andrew Smith said that hundreds of targets imposed on every Whitehall department had created \"shortcomings\" that had hindered the government's performance. The system is to be radically overhauled in the coming months. Mr Smith's remarks were the most candid admission by the government that Mr Blair's much vaunted \"public service agreements\" had proved cumbersome and inoperable. Unveiled amid fanfare in 1998 at the same time as the first spending round, the agreements were designed to improve the performance of departments through targets; Gordon Brown threatened to cut departmental budgets if they did not meet them. With negotiations intensifying in the run-up to the chancellor's second spending round in July, Mr Brown's deputy admitted yesterday that the first set had proved over-ambitious. \"The radical nature of [the agreements] and their immediate impact on departments inevitably led to shortcomings,\" Mr Smith said in a speech to the Blairite think tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research. \"Some of our targets are simply not very good, because we were new to the business.\" He acknowledged ministers had been high-handed in forcing each department to reduce sickness levels among staff. \"Our emphasis on the serious issue of sickness absence in the public sector looks unabalanced when we didn't have comparable measures in other areas of people management,\" said an astonishingly frank Mr Smith. The government also had been mistaken in attempting to set an example to business by paying all invoices on time. \"Setting targets to achieve 100% prompt payment of invoices looks good but will often be unachievable for very sound reasons, if an invoice needs to be investigated,\" he said. In a clear sign of ministerial alarm at the targets' failure, Mr Smith said that the system would be radically changed in July: instead of an average of 30 targets per department, the Mr Brown would set an average of 10: \"The current spending review is a big opportunity to improve the [system] and learn from experience, both positive and negative, as we take them forward.\" Mr Smith's admission was seized on by Labour's opponents. Only last month, in the Budget, the chancellor had said that billions of extra money to be pumped into health and education would be linked to \"modernisation targets\". Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, said last night: \"The targets are political, and the money is drip-fed according to ministers' judgments on who is behaving well. No wonder people cannot plan and manage on that basis. \"It is the height of hypocrisy for Labour leaders to lecture hard working men and women in the public and private sectors about improving their performance when minister cannot even set coherent, workable targets.\" John Garrett, a former Labour MP, rounded on the targets in a Guardian article last year that was praised by Mr Smith. Mr Garrett welcomed the admission and said: \"Public service agreements aim to confuse by swamping people with information. I would like to see them simplified and made more meaningful.\"",

      "byline": "Meg Carter",

      "body": "<p>If you've ever wondered what happens to rock stars when they die, Channel 4 has the answer. In a new late-night animated series which starts on Wednesday, five late popsters - Marc Bolan, Freddie Mercury, Kurt Cobain, John Denver and Biggie Smalls (aka Notorious BIG) - are condemned to an afterlife in limbo as unlikely housemates, while each awaits his turn to finally rest in peace. </p> <p>The new show - The House Of Rock - echoes South Park, Beavis And Butthead and Stella Street. But its setting and storylines go far further - they're more sophisticated, and more surreal - on just a fraction of its predecessors' budget. And thanks to its late-night slot, the humour can cut even closer to the bone. </p> <p>In episode one we are introduced to the five dead stars. Each has been condemned to the House Of Rock for their various abuses - drink, women, drugs... in Bolan's case: lip gloss. The exception is Denver, of course, whose presence is the result of an administrative mistake. The focus of the five's sitting room-bound afterlife is their TV. Upset by coverage of the Mercury Music Awards, Freddie laments being dead means he is no longer eligible to win. So the others cheer him up with the first Dead Rock Star Awards. </p> <p>This, however, is only the entr\u00e9e. Subsequent episodes include Kurt Cobain's discovery of the meaning of true happinesss (although his \"revelation\" turns out to be the result of an amateur lobotomy performed by Bolan), Notorious BIG's sexual obsession with a fridge... and the discovery of Michael Hutchence behind the bathroom door. Tasteless? Undoubtedly. But, the show's creators insist, they've not set out to offend. </p> <p>\"You can certainly go far further with animated sketches than you can with live action - because of context, and because of cost\", House Of Rock producer Gavin Claxton admits. \"But like anything in comedy, you only go with it if it's funny. Which this is. If we thought we'd really upset someone we wouldn't have gone with it at all.\" Besides, he adds, in the world of House Of Rock, deceased favourites can live again. \"We don't just show Marc Bolan crashing into a tree: anyone could do that\", he says. </p> <p>Channel 4 has commissioned House Of Rock as part of its on-going campaign to champion and develop new, home-grown, grown-up animation. The show, animated by cartoonist Andy Watt, has been produced by independent production company Fireside Favourites, which was set up last year to make a one-off comedy pilot for the channel called All Aboard The Cat Bus. </p> <p>Cat Bus's story gives a flavour both of where Fireside are coming from and the direction in which Channel 4 would like to see its adult animation go. The one-off featured Gwyneth Paltrow, who loses her English accent and attempts to get it restored by the Queen. The magic cat bus helps her on her journey - but not before she meets Shaun and Bez from The Happy Mondays, who are on their way to play a game at a pitch-and-putt centre run by the author JD Salinger. </p> <p>Theirs is a brand of animated humour people either instantly love or loathe, Claxton admits. But the success of The Simpsons, South Park and Futurama have made commissioning editors interested in stretching the genre in new directions. And Claxton and his writing partners Richard Preddy and Gary Howe - whose extensive comedy writing credits include work for Harry Enfield, Mel and Griff and Smack The Pony - are eager to cash in. </p> <p>For House Of Rock, Channel 4 wanted an animated series of short sequences to link the live action shows in its late-night 4Music strand. Fireside came up with the idea of Colonel Tom Parker's pickled brain interviewing contemporary rock acts like Beck. Channel 4, however, encouraged the team to pursue other ideas along the dead rock-star theme. Having seen Watt's cartoon work published in SFX, FHM and The Guardian, Claxton approached him to develop the \"look\". \"My style fits the mood, humour and sense of ridiculous in the scripts\", Watt says. \"It appealed because the dialogue and storylines are far more sophisticated than things like Beavis And Butthead.\" </p> <p>The resulting House Of Rock concept persuaded Channel 4 to commission Fireside to make 14 five-minute shorts - each will be split to run around 4Music programmes then repeated in full at each night's end - and a half-hour special due to air in the summer. Budget limitations have restricted the amount of movement seen on screen (another echo of South Park). \"It's been made for pennies rather than the \u00a31 million per episode the makers of The Simpsons enjoy\", Claxton concedes. But necessity has had its benefits - honing the focus of the writers who, between them, also do the show's voices and have written and performed the music. </p> <p>\"Usually, broadcasters say to us: 'Isn't that just a little too strange?'\" adds Claxton. \"With this, though, we were simply told: 'Make it darker.'\" Fireside's efforts so far, however, have paid off. Soon to complete production on House Of Rock, they are also developing Dominion, an animated sci-fi soap about Roger, a man abducted by aliens, due to air on Channel 4 this autumn and again with animation by Andy Watt. </p> <p>\u0095 The House Of Rock, 2.10am, C4</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you've ever wondered what happens to rock stars when they die, Channel 4 has the answer. In a new late-night animated series which starts on Wednesday, five late popsters - Marc Bolan, Freddie Mercury, Kurt Cobain, John Denver and Biggie Smalls (aka Notorious BIG) - are condemned to an afterlife in limbo as unlikely housemates, while each awaits his turn to finally rest in peace. The new show - The House Of Rock - echoes South Park, Beavis And Butthead and Stella Street. But its setting and storylines go far further - they're more sophisticated, and more surreal - on just a fraction of its predecessors' budget. And thanks to its late-night slot, the humour can cut even closer to the bone. In episode one we are introduced to the five dead stars. Each has been condemned to the House Of Rock for their various abuses - drink, women, drugs... in Bolan's case: lip gloss. The exception is Denver, of course, whose presence is the result of an administrative mistake. The focus of the five's sitting room-bound afterlife is their TV. Upset by coverage of the Mercury Music Awards, Freddie laments being dead means he is no longer eligible to win. So the others cheer him up with the first Dead Rock Star Awards. This, however, is only the entr\u00e9e. Subsequent episodes include Kurt Cobain's discovery of the meaning of true happinesss (although his \"revelation\" turns out to be the result of an amateur lobotomy performed by Bolan), Notorious BIG's sexual obsession with a fridge... and the discovery of Michael Hutchence behind the bathroom door. Tasteless? Undoubtedly. But, the show's creators insist, they've not set out to offend. \"You can certainly go far further with animated sketches than you can with live action - because of context, and because of cost\", House Of Rock producer Gavin Claxton admits. \"But like anything in comedy, you only go with it if it's funny. Which this is. If we thought we'd really upset someone we wouldn't have gone with it at all.\" Besides, he adds, in the world of House Of Rock, deceased favourites can live again. \"We don't just show Marc Bolan crashing into a tree: anyone could do that\", he says. Channel 4 has commissioned House Of Rock as part of its on-going campaign to champion and develop new, home-grown, grown-up animation. The show, animated by cartoonist Andy Watt, has been produced by independent production company Fireside Favourites, which was set up last year to make a one-off comedy pilot for the channel called All Aboard The Cat Bus. Cat Bus's story gives a flavour both of where Fireside are coming from and the direction in which Channel 4 would like to see its adult animation go. The one-off featured Gwyneth Paltrow, who loses her English accent and attempts to get it restored by the Queen. The magic cat bus helps her on her journey - but not before she meets Shaun and Bez from The Happy Mondays, who are on their way to play a game at a pitch-and-putt centre run by the author JD Salinger. Theirs is a brand of animated humour people either instantly love or loathe, Claxton admits. But the success of The Simpsons, South Park and Futurama have made commissioning editors interested in stretching the genre in new directions. And Claxton and his writing partners Richard Preddy and Gary Howe - whose extensive comedy writing credits include work for Harry Enfield, Mel and Griff and Smack The Pony - are eager to cash in. For House Of Rock, Channel 4 wanted an animated series of short sequences to link the live action shows in its late-night 4Music strand. Fireside came up with the idea of Colonel Tom Parker's pickled brain interviewing contemporary rock acts like Beck. Channel 4, however, encouraged the team to pursue other ideas along the dead rock-star theme. Having seen Watt's cartoon work published in SFX, FHM and The Guardian, Claxton approached him to develop the \"look\". \"My style fits the mood, humour and sense of ridiculous in the scripts\", Watt says. \"It appealed because the dialogue and storylines are far more sophisticated than things like Beavis And Butthead.\" The resulting House Of Rock concept persuaded Channel 4 to commission Fireside to make 14 five-minute shorts - each will be split to run around 4Music programmes then repeated in full at each night's end - and a half-hour special due to air in the summer. Budget limitations have restricted the amount of movement seen on screen (another echo of South Park). \"It's been made for pennies rather than the \u00a31 million per episode the makers of The Simpsons enjoy\", Claxton concedes. But necessity has had its benefits - honing the focus of the writers who, between them, also do the show's voices and have written and performed the music. \"Usually, broadcasters say to us: 'Isn't that just a little too strange?'\" adds Claxton. \"With this, though, we were simply told: 'Make it darker.'\" Fireside's efforts so far, however, have paid off. Soon to complete production on House Of Rock, they are also developing Dominion, an animated sci-fi soap about Roger, a man abducted by aliens, due to air on Channel 4 this autumn and again with animation by Andy Watt. \u0095 The House Of Rock, 2.10am, C4",

Flight commander Sergei Zalyotin, on his first space mission, and flight engineer Alexander Kaleri, on his third, blasted off from the launch site at Baikonur in Kazakhstan on the two-day flight to dock with Mir. A spokesman at mission control said: \"The launch was perfect.\" Russia's president-elect Vladimir Putin, keen to stress his commitment to prestige projects, recently reversed plans to scrap the 14-year-old orbiting space laboratory while Mir's 21st century viability was further boosted by the decision in January of a group of American millionaires to invest up to $200m (\u00a3125m) in the project to exploit Mir's commercial potential. The two-man crew boarded a Soyuz-TM-30 rocket and went into orbit early yesterday morning. The 48-hour flight to Mir means they are to rendezvous with the station tomorrow. They are to attempt to repair an air leak and prepare Mir for further manned operations. Not on board the Soyuz craft, however, was Vladimir Steklov, a Russian actor being trained to fly to Mir to star in a proposed Anglo-Russian feature film set in space. \"Expect to see me in the next change of crew,\" Mr Steklov quipped yesterday at the Baikonur cosmodrome, adding that the film's backers had so far failed to raise the necessary finance for the project. The American businessmen who revitalised the space station's prospects in January by offering to invest $20m and trying to raise up to $200m for future missions announced yesterday that they were looking for business partners around the world to make Mir fit for space tourism, advertising in space, and for the development of hi-tech products. \"It will be a purely commercial project,\" said Jack Manber, the president of Mir-Corp, the firm set up by the American businessmen to rent the space station from the Russians.

Unveiling plans yesterday for sweeping changes in housing in England, the deputy prime minister held out the vison of a social revolution to give more choice when choosing a home to rent or to buy. His initiative, including other measures to deal with unscrupulous landlords and with homelessness and to give councils a new strategic role, was described by the Tories as \"all mouth and no money\". Pride of place in the housing green paper, billed as the most important review in 25 years, is a \"starter home initiative\" under which key workers in the booming south east, such as nurses and teachers, would be given state aid to buy houses. Mr Prescott told the Commons he was asking housing associations and councils to refine a plan (apparently yet to be costed) \"which could involve interest free loans, development grants and other innovative approaches\". Though the scheme has been trailed, it seems clear the Treasury has yet to give a concrete commitment - a point driven home by the shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman. He said a 132-page document merely represented a shopping list for consultation. \"How much has been costed, who is going to pay, when is he going to deliver?\" Mr Prescott rounded on the Tories for leaving England with a \u00a319bn repairs backlog for council housing after selling 1.3m homes altogether, but it is clear that he is pitching everything on a cash boost from Gordon Brown in July's three-year comprehensive spending review, which takes effect next year. This means that the starter homes initiative, along with other ideas floated yesterday, is in effect a commitment for after the general election, a point tacitly acknowledged when Mr Prescott said firm details would be announced \"in the light of responses\" to the paper and after the chancellor's spending review. Although it was widely expected that the government would signal the end of council housing, Mr Prescott was more cautious yesterday. Eight \"pathfinder\" schemes would be piloted under which the best-performing councils can set up arms-length housing companies and use rental income to borrow on the open market. At present Treasury rules prevent authorities, though not housing associations, borrowing in such a way.",

It was a trenchant, detailed report of the Australian government's protracted negotiations with Britain on sharing the cost of \"safe-sealing\" waste plutonium.</p> <p>Hitherto, much of this highly toxic nuclear material had been lightly bulldozed into the soil rather than buried in deep, secure concrete pits. The question became even more urgent when the Trajrutja people of this central Australian aboriginal nation, some 600 miles north- west of Adelaide, demanded - and were promised - the return of their tribal lands.</p> <p>Anderson's article, backed by an editorial supporting the Australian claim, was timed to appear days before meetings between the respective foreign ministers. His evidence, and the media attention engendered by the material in such a prestigious science journal, played a crucial role in the successful conclusion of the talks.</p> <p>Anderson was born and raised in the Melbourne suburb of Elwood, and began his career as a reporter on Rupert Murdoch's morning tabloid, the Sun News- Pictorial. In 1972, he became deputy information officer at Monash University, while reading for an arts degree.</p> <p>He and his wife Robin, a cancer researcher, had married when he was 21. It was a partnership in which Robin would play a key role in Ian's vocation. In 1979, the couple moved to London, where Robin worked for the Medical Research Council. By chance, they found an advertisement in the New Scientist seeking freelance contributions, through which Robin was able to link her scientific expertise to her husband's journalististic skills. Thus was Ian launched on a new career.</p> <p>In 1982, the couple went to California, where Ian covered Silicon valley for the magazine and freelanced for papers worldwide - including the Guardian - while Robin researched at Stanford University.</p> <p>In 1990, Ian returned to Melbourne to set up an Australasian edition of the New Scientist; he was appalled at the low standard of science journalism in Australia, and was determined to establish a benchmark of excellence - which he did.</p> <p>In 1993, he won two Michael Daley awards for his Maralinga articles. Five years later, in 1998, he won the public communication award from the American Society for Microbiology - his subject was the escape of the rabbit calcivirus - and the New Zealand government awarded him two fellowships, one of which took him to the Antarctic.</p> <p>Ian maintained a lifelong passion for spectator sports, particularly Australian rules football.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife and two sons.</p> <p>Ian Anderson, science journalist, born March 8 1947; died March 30 2000</p>",

Hitherto, much of this highly toxic nuclear material had been lightly bulldozed into the soil rather than buried in deep, secure concrete pits. The question became even more urgent when the Trajrutja people of this central Australian aboriginal nation, some 600 miles north- west of Adelaide, demanded - and were promised - the return of their tribal lands. Anderson's article, backed by an editorial supporting the Australian claim, was timed to appear days before meetings between the respective foreign ministers. His evidence, and the media attention engendered by the material in such a prestigious science journal, played a crucial role in the successful conclusion of the talks. Anderson was born and raised in the Melbourne suburb of Elwood, and began his career as a reporter on Rupert Murdoch's morning tabloid, the Sun News- Pictorial. In 1972, he became deputy information officer at Monash University, while reading for an arts degree. He and his wife Robin, a cancer researcher, had married when he was 21. It was a partnership in which Robin would play a key role in Ian's vocation. In 1979, the couple moved to London, where Robin worked for the Medical Research Council. By chance, they found an advertisement in the New Scientist seeking freelance contributions, through which Robin was able to link her scientific expertise to her husband's journalististic skills. Thus was Ian launched on a new career. In 1982, the couple went to California, where Ian covered Silicon valley for the magazine and freelanced for papers worldwide - including the Guardian - while Robin researched at Stanford University. In 1990, Ian returned to Melbourne to set up an Australasian edition of the New Scientist; he was appalled at the low standard of science journalism in Australia, and was determined to establish a benchmark of excellence - which he did. In 1993, he won two Michael Daley awards for his Maralinga articles. Five years later, in 1998, he won the public communication award from the American Society for Microbiology - his subject was the escape of the rabbit calcivirus - and the New Zealand government awarded him two fellowships, one of which took him to the Antarctic. Ian maintained a lifelong passion for spectator sports, particularly Australian rules football. He is survived by his wife and two sons. Ian Anderson, science journalist, born March 8 1947; died March 30 2000",

Even Linus Torvalds, the Finn who wrote Linux's small core, thinks the system is three years away from being competitive on desktop and, he reminds us, that is what he said three years ago.

Why have some analysts and journalists been suggesting Microsoft is doomed, the PC industry is doomed, and that the tech world is going to be taken over by network computers, high-powered games consoles, television set-top boxes, mobile phones or whatever else happens to be flavour of the month? It is Microsoft's bad luck to be under attack just after it has beaten off one lot of competition and just before the next lot arrives. Although Microsoft's Windows won the battle for the PC operating systems market, this was no foregone conclusion. There were half a dozen proprietary suppliers supplying their own hardware bundled with their own software, including the Acorn Archimedes, Apple Macintosh, Atari ST, Commodore Amiga, the NeXT cube and the Sinclair QL. This is the sort of competition the US justice department seems to want, with lots of pointless duplication of effort and users getting locked in to single suppliers instead of being free to change between hardware brands. There have also been many alternatives to Windows on PCs, including Digital Research's GEM (Graphical Environment Manager), Quarterdeck's DesQview and Be's BeOS. The market had lots of choice, it made its choice and it is not the US government's job to try to roll back or rewrite history. It is especially not the US government's job to decide the course of software development by defining what belongs in an operating system, and what does not - unless it is also planning to throw out the copyright laws. But the question remains: what can be done to control Microsoft while it has a monopoly, and while it struggles for survival against whatever the next generation of technology throws its way. The US Department of Justice needs to think hard about that, because it seems to suppose that problems of conduct and pricing can be solved by making structural changes - to Microsoft or to the market or both. From the consumer's point of view, it would be better advised to apply the existing laws that would increase competition. For example, PC manufacturers and consumers would benefit from published standard prices for Windows, and Microsoft might even make more money out of it. What is more, if people resort to blackmail and other threats, why not throw them into jail?",

The 53-year-old son of a Brooklyn postman has been here before. Klein is the most successful entrepreneur in the US federal bureaucracy - the pen pusher who turned the justice department's anti-trust unit into an astonishing profit centre for the treasury by collecting more than $750m in fines over two years, mostly from European monopolists. This is the man who blocked the merger of two of the biggest names in the US defence industry, charged a group of the world's largest banks with running an illegal conspiracy to control the international credit card industry and then picked a fight with Microsoft within the space of six months. Now he has felled the wealthiest man in the world. </p> <p>Klein may not have the sex appeal of Erin Brockovich. But before the year is out the film rights to the legal war he waged against Microsoft will almost certainly be on its way to the big screen. </p> <p>His contribution was applauded by his boss, Janet Reno, the US attorney general, who described him as \"the man who deserves so much of the credit\" for bringing Microsoft to its knees. But the praise comes not just for completing the case successfully but for starting it in the first place. </p> <p>George Carey, a senior anti-trust lawyer in Washington, said yesterday: \"Joel deserves a lot of the credit because he had the courage to actually pursue the case.\" </p> <p>Klein, who appeared during important parts of the 77-day court hearing against Microsoft, acted as a sort of field general in the campaign. David Boies, the chief prosecutor with a penchant for red meat and cheap suits, was his chief gladiator. Klein limited his appearances to a few post-victory salutes wearing his trademark Cheshire Cat grin and navy blue suits. </p> <p>But unlike Boies, Klein made his name fighting for the impoverished, the mentally ill and people with learning difficulties. Growing up in public housing in the New York district of Queens, Klein was an unlikely candidate for the Washington in-crowd. When he was appointed chief trust-buster he was treated with the cold suspicion usually reserved for an outsider, because he was thought to be soft on big business. </p> <p>Some tried to block his appointment. \"The only thing Justice would use its enforcement authority on is the merger of Jupiter with Neptune,\" said Lloyd Constantine, a former anti-trust official. In 1997 Klein was decried as a \"weak\" choice by the New York Times. </p> <p>Now that Judge Thomas Jackson has ruled against Microsoft, Klein's critics are concerned about his strength. They worry that he is overzealous and even an enemy of commerce. When asked whether Klein was still regarded as pro-business, Carey, who once worked with him, laughed. \"I don't think there's anyone that thinks that any more,\" he said. </p> <p>But Klein rejects any claim that his battle against the commercial big guns is driven by ideology. He said he would not kowtow to the public demands for blood at the same time as refusing to bow down to big business. \"The public notion of tackling giants, that's a mistake,\" he says. \"You have to look at the particular facts of a case. I'm not here to tackle big corporations or get in the way of economic efficiencies. </p> <p>\"I don't have this overarching theoretical model I'm trying to lower on the economy,\" he says. \"I'm trying to decide each case on its merits, one at a time, not on ideological grounds.\" He credits mainstream economic thinkers rather than legal or political ones as his great influences. \"My thinking is mainstream economic thinking,\" he says. </p> <p>However, Klein does have a healthy mistrust of monopolies. At a gathering of computer industry leaders last October, a sensitive time in the case, Klein said simply: \"Monopolies have to be held to a different standard because they have monopoly power.\" </p> <p>While his motivations may be eclectic, the vigour with which he wages his battles is all his own. His friends, who describe him as both \"scrappy\" and \"sophisticated\", believe that his fighting methods highlight his defining characteristics: his immense intelligence and street-smart aggression. When talks broke down with Microsoft, the company's lawyers blamed the politicking local attorney generals rather than the justice department. Yet Klein is on the record as saying that he would rather go to trial than quietly negotiate financial penalties. </p> <p>Klein started his career by winning a scholarship to Columbia University, where he earned a degree in economics, and then went to Harvard University law school. He was awarded magna cum laude at both. After working with people with disabilities he went on to become a corporate lawyer before breaking off to start his own company. Like many Democrats in the Clinton era, his career took a new turn when he met the president. Klein and his wife, Patsy Davis, were regulars at the \"renaissance weekends\" hosted by the Clintons in the 80s. In 1993, he was asked to help shepherd a Clinton nomination through the supreme court. </p> <p>In the two years he worked at the White House he managed to gain a cameo role in the two greatest scandals of the Clinton presidency. During the Whitewater affair he argued that all White House documents implicated in the matter should be made public. It was this viewpoint that would earn him the wrath of the First Lady. And he was the man responsible for moving Linda Tripp, the woman who secretly taped Monica Lewinsky, from the White House, thus provoking her ire. </p> <p>The fact that he would become even slightly embroiled in both scandals tells us something about the desire of the man to be where the action is. The fact that he survived them both tells us something about his ability to outsmart his detractors. </p> <p>But his proximity to power, and hunger for it, has not left him without endearing human qualities. Lloyd Cutler, a friend and former colleague in the White House counsel's office, has said: \"He's just about the only lawyer my wife likes. He can communicate feelings and read other people's feelings.\" </p> <p>He went through a divorce at the start of the Microsoft proceedings almost two years ago. But his teenage daughter still lives with him when she is not away at school and he often says he wants to go home to spend \"quantity time\" with her when he leaves the office . </p> <p>His interests include tennis and reading biographies of famous jurists. The government safely proved that Microsoft was such a beast by simply pointing out that its Windows software is used on more than 90% of the world's computers. Robert Pitofsky, the federal trade commission chairman and an old friend of Klein, says: \"He doesn't fit comfortably into any one camp in anti-trust. He takes his cases one at a time.\" </p> <p>But the case Klein chose to pursue, against the company credited with making more millionaires than any other in the history of corporate America, was also likely to get more coverage around the world than almost any other. Although Klein has allowed several huge mergers in the telecommunications industry, he is credited with helping the Clinton administration bring anti-trust issues to the front of the political agenda. Some campaigners believe Klein was simply in the right place at the right time.

Other analysts argue that he will be only too glad to give up his relatively tiny government salary, estimated at about $148,000 (\u00a390,000), for \"10 times as much\" as a corporate lawyer.

Her ex-husband, identified as AZ, objected, even though his ex-wife showed seven consent forms he had signed over the years saying that if the couple separated, the embryos would revert to her for implantation.</p> <p>A family court had ruled in favour of AZ, saying that because the couple had had twins, circumstances had changed too much for him to be held to it.</p> <p>But the supreme judicial court, in a ruling it made in February but has only now backed up with a detailed opinion, took a big step further. The consent forms, it said, had some problems, but \"even had the husband and wife entered into an unambiguous agreement between themselves regarding the disposition of the frozen pre-embryos, we would not enforce an agreement that would compel one donor to become a parent against his or her will. As a matter of public policy, we conclude that forced procreation is not an area amenable to judicial enforcement.\"</p> <p>The opinion, by Justice Judith Cowin, said that \"respect for liberty and privacy requires that individuals be accorded the freedom to decide whether to enter into a family relationship\".</p> <p>In similar cases, state courts have tended to rule that whenever possible, the agreement a couple signs with a fertility clinic about what to do with their embryos in the event of a divorce or death should be considered a contract. A few legislatures have considered or passed laws requiring such agreements. But the Massachusetts ruling, experts say, indicates that such a contract is far from ironclad.</p> <p>Couples \"cannot assume that one or the other can use the frozen embryos in the event of a divorce in Massachusetts or any court jurisdiction that follows Massachusetts\", said Susan Crockin, a lawyer specialising in reproductive technology. <b>The New York Times</b></p>",

The opinion is expected to influence court decisions around the country in a nascent area of the law: how to treat hi-tech baby-making, and in particular, how to decide the fates of frozen embryos when the couples who have made them separate or divorce. Such cases have reached three state supreme courts, are pending in half a dozen other states and are likely to become more common as the number of frozen embryos, now estimated at 150,000, increases. In the Massachusetts case, a woman identified in court as BZ wanted to try, at 44, to become pregnant using the four frozen embryos left from her years of fertility treatments. Her ex-husband, identified as AZ, objected, even though his ex-wife showed seven consent forms he had signed over the years saying that if the couple separated, the embryos would revert to her for implantation. A family court had ruled in favour of AZ, saying that because the couple had had twins, circumstances had changed too much for him to be held to it. But the supreme judicial court, in a ruling it made in February but has only now backed up with a detailed opinion, took a big step further. The consent forms, it said, had some problems, but \"even had the husband and wife entered into an unambiguous agreement between themselves regarding the disposition of the frozen pre-embryos, we would not enforce an agreement that would compel one donor to become a parent against his or her will. As a matter of public policy, we conclude that forced procreation is not an area amenable to judicial enforcement.\" The opinion, by Justice Judith Cowin, said that \"respect for liberty and privacy requires that individuals be accorded the freedom to decide whether to enter into a family relationship\". In similar cases, state courts have tended to rule that whenever possible, the agreement a couple signs with a fertility clinic about what to do with their embryos in the event of a divorce or death should be considered a contract. A few legislatures have considered or passed laws requiring such agreements. But the Massachusetts ruling, experts say, indicates that such a contract is far from ironclad. Couples \"cannot assume that one or the other can use the frozen embryos in the event of a divorce in Massachusetts or any court jurisdiction that follows Massachusetts\", said Susan Crockin, a lawyer specialising in reproductive technology.

Beyond doubt, he was a spy,\" said Romano Canosa, author of Mussolini's Secret Service, published this week.</p> <p>Silone became a spy in 1924 and under the codename Silvestri betrayed his colleagues to the dictator's secret police, said Mr Canosa, a historian and a judge.</p> <p>The motive was neither money nor love but an ideological ambiguity. \"He was a complicated man, it's difficult to know what drove him.\"</p> <p>The author, who some critics have credited with inspiring George Orwell's Animal Farm, stopped spying in 1930. In a letter to a Fascist functionary, Emilia Bellone, he confessed an existential crisis. He wanted to shed \"everything in my life that is based on falsehood and duplicity\".</p> <p>Later that year he wrote Fontamara, a tale about a village's revolt against landlords and fascist thugs sent to enforce unjust laws. The novel's power and beauty made it an instant classic. Mr Canosa suggested the work was motivated by guilt.</p> <p>Silone's treachery remained a secret after he moved to Switzerland and, with George Orwell and Arthur Koestler, galvanised opponents of totalitarianism with The God that Failed, a collection of essays.</p> <p>The death of Silone's brother in a fascist jail cemented his status as a favourite of the left. His novel Bread and Wine was hailed as another onslaught on intolerance. The veneration continued after his death in 1972.</p> <p>Stuart Hood, who escaped an Italian prisoner-of-war camp, fought with partisans and translated Italian literature, was astonished at the revelation.</p> <p>\"It is an extraordinary story, shocking. Silone was an icon of humanistic communism. Fontamara was viscerally anti-fascist, it was deeply empathetic with the peasants. It had a huge impact.</p> <p>\"These claims raise question marks over all his work. Either the accusations are false or Fontamara is false. This will create a lot of sorrow.\" The case echoes claims that Orwell spied for the British secret services.</p> <p>Two other scholars, Dario Biocca and Mauro Canali, have made the same claims in another new book, The Informer: Silone, the Communists and the Police.</p> <p>The veteran commentator Indro Montanelli savaged the claims in the newspaper Corriere della Sera. He said that the first person to be put in charge of intelligence documents in the central state archive was Palmiro Togliatti, head of the Communist party and sworn foe of Silone. It was wrong to put the past on trial.</p> <p>However Antonella Passarelli, who teaches Italian literature at the American University at Rome, said the accusations could have a profound impact.</p> <p>\"If this is true our interpretation of Fontamara and other works will have to change. We will have to re-read everything and think again.\"</p>",

Silone became a spy in 1924 and under the codename Silvestri betrayed his colleagues to the dictator's secret police, said Mr Canosa, a historian and a judge. The motive was neither money nor love but an ideological ambiguity. \"He was a complicated man, it's difficult to know what drove him.\" The author, who some critics have credited with inspiring George Orwell's Animal Farm, stopped spying in 1930. In a letter to a Fascist functionary, Emilia Bellone, he confessed an existential crisis. He wanted to shed \"everything in my life that is based on falsehood and duplicity\". Later that year he wrote Fontamara, a tale about a village's revolt against landlords and fascist thugs sent to enforce unjust laws. The novel's power and beauty made it an instant classic. Mr Canosa suggested the work was motivated by guilt. Silone's treachery remained a secret after he moved to Switzerland and, with George Orwell and Arthur Koestler, galvanised opponents of totalitarianism with The God that Failed, a collection of essays. The death of Silone's brother in a fascist jail cemented his status as a favourite of the left. His novel Bread and Wine was hailed as another onslaught on intolerance. The veneration continued after his death in 1972. Stuart Hood, who escaped an Italian prisoner-of-war camp, fought with partisans and translated Italian literature, was astonished at the revelation. \"It is an extraordinary story, shocking. Silone was an icon of humanistic communism. Fontamara was viscerally anti-fascist, it was deeply empathetic with the peasants. It had a huge impact. \"These claims raise question marks over all his work. Either the accusations are false or Fontamara is false. This will create a lot of sorrow.\" The case echoes claims that Orwell spied for the British secret services. Two other scholars, Dario Biocca and Mauro Canali, have made the same claims in another new book, The Informer: Silone, the Communists and the Police. The veteran commentator Indro Montanelli savaged the claims in the newspaper Corriere della Sera. He said that the first person to be put in charge of intelligence documents in the central state archive was Palmiro Togliatti, head of the Communist party and sworn foe of Silone. It was wrong to put the past on trial. However Antonella Passarelli, who teaches Italian literature at the American University at Rome, said the accusations could have a profound impact. \"If this is true our interpretation of Fontamara and other works will have to change. We will have to re-read everything and think again.\"",

      "bodyText": "An emergency government meeting was called yesterday to deal with a crisis of confidence in France's management of international bank cards in which foreign-issued plastic is considered particularly vulnerable to fraud. Insurance firms have threatened to cancel cover against losses for both French cards, which incorporate a microchip, and foreign issues protected by a magnetic strip. The move follows accusations by an independent consumer inquiry that fraud was at least 17 times higher than reported by the 175 French institutions that jointly manage Visa, Mastercard and other popular systems in France. The consumer minister, Marylise Lebranchu, summoned charge card managers, user groups and traders to her office over the alleged mismanagement of the 34m cards issued in France and the failure to protect plastic used by foreign visitors. An investigation by the consumer wing of the trade union Force Ouvri\u00e8re, which is strongly represented in banks, claimed that at least \u00a3300m a year was creamed off through charge card fraud - 17 times more than admitted by the big banks joint management group, GIE. Although bankers said the estimate was \"a fantasy\" and that France had \"the safest system in the world\", they lost public trust after hackers issued internet instructions on how to make microchip cards that can fool cash machines. This year, a programmer was given a 10-month suspended sentence for cracking a supposedly unbreakable charge card code and asking for \u00a320m to develop a fail-safe response. According to Force Ouvri\u00e8re's spokesman, Charles Riguardati, French banks hid the extent of customer losses by failing to reveal statistics on the cost to foreign visitors using British-style plastic. \"This amounts to at least \u00a3220m a year,\" he said. \"To diminish the size of overall criminal losses even further, banks disclose only claims repaid by insurance firms - nowhere near the real level of this type of fraud.\" Insurance companies have warned that unless protection is tightened within 45 days they will withdraw cover.",

The crisis was triggered by rejection of the restructuring programme put forward by the troubled company's new-broom chief executive, Bill Simpson. It was not clear last night whether Mr Simpson, who was appointed only in December, was still with the company. Gresham's shares, which stood as high as 189p just over a year ago, yesterday lost another 2p, dropping to 36p. The chairman, Roger Graham has resigned, as have two other non-executive directors, Peter Bickerton and Clifford Jakes. The company's financial adviser, the Close Brothers merchant bank, and its stockbroker, SG Securities, have also resigned. It seems that Mr Simpson's strategy of selling off some businesses and concentrating on three main areas - website testing, e-business software design and financial systems consultancy - failed to win support from two major director-shareholders, Sid Green, with 30.6%, and Steve Purchase, with 15.1%. Mr Simpson, who joined Gresham in June last year, is thought to have planned a sale of the US data storage business and its computer personnel subsidiary. He was formerly with both British computer group ICL and America's IBM group. Mr Jakes joined the board in September. In February, Gresham announced losses of \u00a3864,000 for the year to October 31 1999, against profits the previous year of \u00a33,003,000. Mr Graham said that escalating costs and sluggish growth had helped tip the group into the red. He described the results as \"extremely disappointing\", adding that fears for the millennium bug had choked off business as clients put major projects to one side until after the new year celebrations. In December, Gresham disappointed fans of speedway motorcycle racing by announcing that it would not be renewing its sponsorship of the Oxford team, which is owned by Mr Purchase. Gresham had previously supported the team to the tune of about \u00a350,000 a year.",

      "body": "<p>Vaccine specialist Peptide Therapeutics yesterday insisted it was strong enough to survive as an independent, despite a 57% jump in its full-year losses to \u00a313.6m. </p> <p>The company's production line includes vaccines for yellow fever, typhoid and travellers' diarrhoea. However, it has been weakened by setbacks to several products over the last year. </p> <p>Peptide admitted last week that it was in preliminary bid talks. Speculation about the identity of the bidder has settled on Cantab Pharmaceuticals, and there were also suggestions yesterday of interest from the US. However, Peptide chief executive John Brown said: \"We could stay on our own. We've got very strong finances, a good portfolio and technology which can lead to more products.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown said any offer would have to be \"one that makes us a more robust company\". He added: \"It's got to be a good fit. People don't merge to cut costs in this industry.\" </p> <p>Cantab also specialises in vaccines, although its products aim to treat, rather than prevent, disease. Its products include therapies for genital warts, cervical cancer and nicotine addiction. Cantab's chief executive, Jurek Sikorski, has said he wants to do deals to build critical mass. Peptide's shares fell 15p to 99p, valuing the business at \u00a378m. Another company mentioned as a possible suitor, Powderject Pharmaceuticals, is not believed to be seriously interested. Peptide's losses were higher because of its recent $20m (\u00a312.5m) purchase of OraVax, a loss-making American vaccines firm.

      "bodyText": "Vaccine specialist Peptide Therapeutics yesterday insisted it was strong enough to survive as an independent, despite a 57% jump in its full-year losses to \u00a313.6m. The company's production line includes vaccines for yellow fever, typhoid and travellers' diarrhoea. However, it has been weakened by setbacks to several products over the last year. Peptide admitted last week that it was in preliminary bid talks. Speculation about the identity of the bidder has settled on Cantab Pharmaceuticals, and there were also suggestions yesterday of interest from the US. However, Peptide chief executive John Brown said: \"We could stay on our own. We've got very strong finances, a good portfolio and technology which can lead to more products.\" Mr Brown said any offer would have to be \"one that makes us a more robust company\". He added: \"It's got to be a good fit. People don't merge to cut costs in this industry.\" Cantab also specialises in vaccines, although its products aim to treat, rather than prevent, disease. Its products include therapies for genital warts, cervical cancer and nicotine addiction. Cantab's chief executive, Jurek Sikorski, has said he wants to do deals to build critical mass. Peptide's shares fell 15p to 99p, valuing the business at \u00a378m. Another company mentioned as a possible suitor, Powderject Pharmaceuticals, is not believed to be seriously interested. Peptide's losses were higher because of its recent $20m (\u00a312.5m) purchase of OraVax, a loss-making American vaccines firm. The group's first product, to prevent yellow fever, is to be launched next year, with potential sales of $25m. But analysts were doubtful about its ability to survive without a deal. Max Herrmann of Charterhouse Securities said: \"They're not a viable entity to go it alone. They have about two years' more cash and they'll have a hard time raising more.\" \u0095 Biotechnology firm Scotia Holdings could target disorders including heart disease after a deal with American group Techniclone yesterday.",

      "byline": "Brian Logan",

      "body": "<p>One approaches a visit to Edward Bond in his own home rather as one might steel oneself for a trip to Bluebeard's castle. One doesn't expect to leave intact. The playwright's \"difficult\" reputation, as much as the increasing difficulty of his plays, has precipitated exile from the British theatre which his lacerating dramas of moral responsibility - Saved, Lear, Early Morning - once animated. The last time I interviewed him, with the director of his 1996 play Coffee - Dan Baron Cohen - sitting in too, Bond parroted the phrase \"I agree with Dan\" in response to every inquiry. </p> <p>This time it's different. Bond is the very soul of courtesy, reserving his ire for the \"nonentities\" of the theatre world he's left behind and for the injustices of global capitalism he delineates in his new radio play, Chair. Before the tape recorder is even on, he's damning British theatre - specifically the work of Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, who once revived Bond's The Sea - as \"an obscenity\", and crowing about the imminent French productions of Coffee and of a new play, Crime of the 21st Century. </p> <p>His success in Europe is integral to the Bond myth. \"The Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise says I'm the most important theoretician of drama since Brecht,\" he says, before adding, with an immodest shrug, \"Well, it's a fact.\" Chair may be Bond's first radio play (\"I wrote it in two and a half days, just like that,\" he says), but the writer doesn't doubt that our continental cousins will stage it. </p> <p>About the play - an oblique dramatic poem set in a futuristic dystopia that outlaws community and busses old ladies to their execution - Bond is even more talkative, reciting at interminable length his critique of societies, such as ours, that colonise or cauterise their citizens' imaginations. He decries what he calls \"social madness_ the people who went off in 1914 were socially mad; the people who dropped A-bombs on Hiroshima and named the bombs after their mothers, they were mad - there's no other way of describing it. But it's totally acceptable. Why is that so? Because our societies are unjust.\" </p> <p>Bond talks in essays. In his grand sweep, he embroils theoretical leaps with which it's impossible to keep up (\"when Galileo looked through that telescope, Auschwitz became inevitable\") and lucid, if desiccated, arguments. This isn't a conversation, and it takes several interruptions to persuade him to discuss Chair rather than to orate about it. I suggest that the society he envisages in the play is too apocalyptically atomised to credit. \"Whatever the economy needs to maintain itself, the government will do it,\" he replies, tangentially. \"That means we are caught in a terrifying dilemma. The natural order says certain things are born, make love, eat and die. The economy says: consume, destroy. Those two things clash, and they disrupt society. So society has become more and more disorientated, lost and destructive.\" </p> <p>Bond cites the fear of crime, mass incarceration in the States, erosion of trial by jury. \"We're on a treadmill, and the fact that some of the bars of the treadmill are made of sugar candy, and we can lick them as they go round, doesn't make our position any securer. The world of Chair is absolutely possible if we don't learn to describe what's happening to us.\" </p> <p>Bond's thoughts on his profession are consistent with his thoughts on the world. \"It has become a product,\" he says of the theatre. \"Humanity's become a product and when humanity is a product, you get Auschwitz and you get Chair.\" It should be theatre's role \"to recreate what it means to be human, to redefine our relationship with the world\", while the dramatist's problem is \"how do you speak sanity to the insane?\" </p> <p>So far, so polemical - but here's the ambition. \"It seems absurd in our society to say, 'Well, actually, we could be saved by our theatre.' People would say, 'How bloody ridiculous.' But who did they say was the greatest Englishman of the millennium? What Shakespeare and the Greeks were able to do was radically question what it meant to be a human being. Do you really think that what happens at the RSC or at the National Theatre or in your average television show is doing that?\" </p> <p>This is audaciously idealistic talk - until one remembers that Bond is complicit in his own alienation from the British stage. If he wants to re-invent our \"corrupt\" theatre, why not fight, or compromise, to have his work performed? If he seeks to inaugurate a new theatre for a wider audience, why write such dense, difficult plays? </p> <p>Compromise is anathema to Bond, who cites as his heroes \"C\u00e9zanne, who threw his pictures out of the window, and Michelangelo, who smashed his marbles because he was unhappy with them.\" Compromise is also unnecessary. \"If you engage people on a vital, important level, they will respond. But you can't just go to factory workers and say, \"Here's Hamlet.\" You have to learn the language of Hamlet. It would take time.\" Time for which the commercial imperative Bond seeks to circumvent will not allow. </p> <p>In any event, he's constitutionally incapable of a rapprochement with \"Americanised\" British theatre. \"Supposing you went to Holy Communion,\" says Bond, his nose wrinkling, \"and the priest was so drunk he was pissing himself. You'd say, 'This can't be right.' But we do the equivalent on our stages.\" </p> <p>The biggest sadness, he says, is that new writers are forced to homogenise. \"They cannot go beyond the symptom. They're like Terence Rattigan but with obscenities.\" The exception is Sarah Kane, who Bond knew and admired, but who \"was surrounded by really trivial people\", whose work was \"trivialised and made pretty\" and who was \"killed by our theatre\". </p> <p>If he regrets this rupture with the community in which he made his name, he hides it in relish of his own acerbity. At one point, describing how Trevor Nunn has turned the National into \"a Technicolor sewer\", Bond winks at me, \"Put some of those remarks in, please.\" While the Royal Court considered opening their new building with a revival of Saved, Bond's new work is more likely to be performed by Theatre in Education groups, which he famously adores. \"A child of 14 or 15 asks the questions Plato asked,\" he attests, \"and if you engage the child in drama on that level the child is fascinated.\" The enthusiasm isn't counterfeit: non-institutional theatre meets Bond's need to see theatre having an immediate imaginative effect in a classless environment.

      "bodyText": "One approaches a visit to Edward Bond in his own home rather as one might steel oneself for a trip to Bluebeard's castle. One doesn't expect to leave intact. The playwright's \"difficult\" reputation, as much as the increasing difficulty of his plays, has precipitated exile from the British theatre which his lacerating dramas of moral responsibility - Saved, Lear, Early Morning - once animated. The last time I interviewed him, with the director of his 1996 play Coffee - Dan Baron Cohen - sitting in too, Bond parroted the phrase \"I agree with Dan\" in response to every inquiry. This time it's different. Bond is the very soul of courtesy, reserving his ire for the \"nonentities\" of the theatre world he's left behind and for the injustices of global capitalism he delineates in his new radio play, Chair. Before the tape recorder is even on, he's damning British theatre - specifically the work of Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, who once revived Bond's The Sea - as \"an obscenity\", and crowing about the imminent French productions of Coffee and of a new play, Crime of the 21st Century. His success in Europe is integral to the Bond myth. \"The Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise says I'm the most important theoretician of drama since Brecht,\" he says, before adding, with an immodest shrug, \"Well, it's a fact.\" Chair may be Bond's first radio play (\"I wrote it in two and a half days, just like that,\" he says), but the writer doesn't doubt that our continental cousins will stage it. About the play - an oblique dramatic poem set in a futuristic dystopia that outlaws community and busses old ladies to their execution - Bond is even more talkative, reciting at interminable length his critique of societies, such as ours, that colonise or cauterise their citizens' imaginations. He decries what he calls \"social madness_ the people who went off in 1914 were socially mad; the people who dropped A-bombs on Hiroshima and named the bombs after their mothers, they were mad - there's no other way of describing it. But it's totally acceptable. Why is that so? Because our societies are unjust.\" Bond talks in essays. In his grand sweep, he embroils theoretical leaps with which it's impossible to keep up (\"when Galileo looked through that telescope, Auschwitz became inevitable\") and lucid, if desiccated, arguments. This isn't a conversation, and it takes several interruptions to persuade him to discuss Chair rather than to orate about it. I suggest that the society he envisages in the play is too apocalyptically atomised to credit. \"Whatever the economy needs to maintain itself, the government will do it,\" he replies, tangentially. \"That means we are caught in a terrifying dilemma. The natural order says certain things are born, make love, eat and die. The economy says: consume, destroy. Those two things clash, and they disrupt society. So society has become more and more disorientated, lost and destructive.\" Bond cites the fear of crime, mass incarceration in the States, erosion of trial by jury. \"We're on a treadmill, and the fact that some of the bars of the treadmill are made of sugar candy, and we can lick them as they go round, doesn't make our position any securer. The world of Chair is absolutely possible if we don't learn to describe what's happening to us.\" Bond's thoughts on his profession are consistent with his thoughts on the world. \"It has become a product,\" he says of the theatre. \"Humanity's become a product and when humanity is a product, you get Auschwitz and you get Chair.\" It should be theatre's role \"to recreate what it means to be human, to redefine our relationship with the world\", while the dramatist's problem is \"how do you speak sanity to the insane?\" So far, so polemical - but here's the ambition. \"It seems absurd in our society to say, 'Well, actually, we could be saved by our theatre.' People would say, 'How bloody ridiculous.' But who did they say was the greatest Englishman of the millennium? What Shakespeare and the Greeks were able to do was radically question what it meant to be a human being. Do you really think that what happens at the RSC or at the National Theatre or in your average television show is doing that?\" This is audaciously idealistic talk - until one remembers that Bond is complicit in his own alienation from the British stage. If he wants to re-invent our \"corrupt\" theatre, why not fight, or compromise, to have his work performed? If he seeks to inaugurate a new theatre for a wider audience, why write such dense, difficult plays? Compromise is anathema to Bond, who cites as his heroes \"C\u00e9zanne, who threw his pictures out of the window, and Michelangelo, who smashed his marbles because he was unhappy with them.\" Compromise is also unnecessary. \"If you engage people on a vital, important level, they will respond. But you can't just go to factory workers and say, \"Here's Hamlet.\" You have to learn the language of Hamlet. It would take time.\" Time for which the commercial imperative Bond seeks to circumvent will not allow. In any event, he's constitutionally incapable of a rapprochement with \"Americanised\" British theatre. \"Supposing you went to Holy Communion,\" says Bond, his nose wrinkling, \"and the priest was so drunk he was pissing himself. You'd say, 'This can't be right.' But we do the equivalent on our stages.\" The biggest sadness, he says, is that new writers are forced to homogenise. \"They cannot go beyond the symptom. They're like Terence Rattigan but with obscenities.\" The exception is Sarah Kane, who Bond knew and admired, but who \"was surrounded by really trivial people\", whose work was \"trivialised and made pretty\" and who was \"killed by our theatre\". If he regrets this rupture with the community in which he made his name, he hides it in relish of his own acerbity. At one point, describing how Trevor Nunn has turned the National into \"a Technicolor sewer\", Bond winks at me, \"Put some of those remarks in, please.\" While the Royal Court considered opening their new building with a revival of Saved, Bond's new work is more likely to be performed by Theatre in Education groups, which he famously adores. \"A child of 14 or 15 asks the questions Plato asked,\" he attests, \"and if you engage the child in drama on that level the child is fascinated.\" The enthusiasm isn't counterfeit: non-institutional theatre meets Bond's need to see theatre having an immediate imaginative effect in a classless environment. Among the chattering classes who frequent mainstream theatre, this rarely happens. Should we be ashamed of that, and of Bond's assertion that his brand of rigorously investigative theatre \"still has a validity abroad that it doesn't have in this country\"? Bond's polemics are often justified. Who that loves theatre doesn't wish it were as vital as he demands it should be? Whether his still prolific output could help bring such a theatre about is open to question - a question Chair, which is minor Bond, won't answer. I think a writer with his uniquely epic faith in the possibilities of drama deserves a platform in his own country, and deserves, not uncritically, to be indulged. But it won't happen. \"It's wonderful to be able to sit down and write a play,\" says Bond, \"it fascinates me. The fact that I don't have to go along and watch Sam Mendes direct it,\" he adds, conclusively, \"is a great relief.\" \u0095 Chair is on Radio 4 at 9pm on Friday.",

      "body": "<p>In 1982 Jon Hough was a happy 21-year-old student with everything to look forward to. Within a year, following the death of his mother and the onset of depression, he had been sectioned and put in a mental hospital. His weight dropped below four stone and he fell into a coma. </p> <p>He was transferred to the Maudsley hospital, south London, where he stayed for over a year before being discharged with a handshake and the offer of a year's psychotherapy. He might have gone mad; instead he discovered the stage. </p> <p>With his theatre company Ridiculusmus, Hough produced one of the few high points of last year's Edinburgh festival, an extraordinary two-hander about madness. Now that play, Yes, Yes, Yes, is about to open at London's BAC. </p> <p>Yes, Yes, Yes is an upbeat title for a piece that while very funny is touched by the sadness of madness. But then, Hough and Ridiculusmus's co-founder, David Woods, want us to embrace the idea of insanity. Madness, they argue, is a social construct. Some cultures and societies revere the wise fool. </p> <p>This approach may sound simplistic, even flip, but Hough and Woods have earned the right to be funny about madness. While Hough was experiencing his breakdown, the teenage Woods was coming to terms with the fact that at least three generations of his family had experienced mental illness: \"It took me a long time to realise that it wasn't normal for members of your family just to collapse upon you in states of severe anxiety.\" </p> <p>Five years ago Woods's elder brother, a computer engineer, flew off to China on business. He came back in an ambulance. Nobody knows exactly what happened. But Woods says the family has tried to piece together the story and it seems exhaustion, a dinner involving raw chicken's feet and perhaps a genetic predisposition, pushed his brother over the edge. He now spends most of his time in bed. </p> <p>Like his grandfather before him, Woods's brother suffers from a condition called florid psychosis, a mental illness that makes the patient believe he has gained unique insights into life. There is evidence that some religious leaders also suffer from the condition. </p> <p>Hough and Woods play cleverly with the idea of florid psychosis in Yes, Yes, Yes, in which Mr H, an excitable bundle of confused identity, and his manic-depressive friend Chatterjee try to explain the meaning of life through an evening of philosophical discussion peppered with autobiographical touches. </p> <p>This brief description hardly begins to do justice to 70 minutes that is endearingly funny and combines first-rate physical skill with such superb comic timing that the descent into mayhem seems quite logical, even as everything that could go wrong does. The hapless Mr H loses his money, job, wife and status but remains unfailingly optimistic. His optimism is a complete madness in the face of reality. </p> <p>The stroke of brilliance is never mentioning the word madness and never setting out to be funny. Back in the early 90s, Hough and Woods's rejection of the gag or punchline was so intense that they ran an anti-comedy club that invited people to do very unfunny routines. \"You don't have to try to be funny,\" says Woods. \"The truth is generally hilarious.\" But he adds that audience response to Yes, Yes, Yes is extremely varied. One performance in Northern Ireland raised not a single laugh; in Dorset almost everyone was crying by the end. When I saw the show in Edinburgh last summer, playing in a room in a VD clinic, the small audience was in fits of laughter. </p> <p> But the creation of Yes, Yes, Yes has been long and painful, and performing takes its toll too. \"I love doing The Exhibitionists [Ridiculusmus's award-winning play about what gallery attendants get up to when nobody is looking], but doing Yes, Yes, Yes is like having to be coaxed out of a dark room,\" says Woods. Hough argues that the process the company uses to create its shows is akin to having a breakdown: \"We go into a room with an idea and ourselves, and for 10 hours a day you delve into yourself. There is chaos and a search for order preceded by depression and boredom.\" </p> <p>The pair first began working on the idea in 1994, but Yes, Yes, Yes was really shaped by a trip to India in 1996. They met a swami, who invited them to come to his mission, where they found a community of \"ranting men\" and other mentally ill patients. The pair stayed for some weeks working with these men, playing ring-a-ring a roses and other games. Some of that strange innocence informs Yes, Yes, Yes. </p> <p>Later, in Bangalore, they came across a man called MM Murthy, who runs the International Humour Society and believes that laughing brings you closer to God. \"It is like a sect and his speeches go on for hours and are full of terrible jokes and puns.\" Mr M in Yes, Yes, Yes is a close cousin of MM Murthy. </p> <p>Pitched somewhere between meta-theatre, philosophical treatise and frivolous stupidity, Yes, Yes, Yes suggests the mad are truly sane and that anyone who doesn't recognise that we're all in a mess must be utterly insane. Perhaps it should be no surprise that the company's next show, Say Nothing, is about the Northern Ireland peace process and includes a scene in which two characters face off, each menacingly wielding a chair and trying to determine who will decommission their chair first. </p> <p>\u0095 Yes, Yes, Yes is at BAC, London SW11 (0171-223 2223) till April 16.</p>",

Now visitors to Bankside from around the world can take a trip across the river to Ye Museum of Ye Younge British Artists in picturesque Hoxton Square. \u0095 White Cube 2 opens on April 15 at 48 Hoxton Square, London N1 (0171-930 5373).",

Wagnerians are used to the opera being performed in a single act, but the ROH does it in three for \"safety reasons\", according to the management. Michael Varcoe-Cocks of London W6, in a letter to the Times this week, detects a more sinister agenda: for \"safety reasons\", he suggests, read \"financial reasons\". The ROH, he complains, has been transformed into \"an expensive restaurant providing bites of opera or dance between the courses\". He fears the three-interval La Boh\u00e8me will end up with five (\"aperitif, first course, main course, cheese, pudding, coffee\"). </p> <p>I'm not much of an opera-goer, but I can sympathise. In fact, one reason I prefer cinema-going to opera or theatre is that I can't stand intervals. I still haven't got over the notoriously short first act of David Mamet's The Cryptogram - you'd only just stuffed your coat under your seat when you were back in the bar arguing about Eddie Izzard's American accent. But it's not so much that intervals shatter the dramatic illusion or break the concentration, I just feel uncomfortable standing around at a loss for intelligent comments about what I've not yet digested. </p> <p>I know I'm a weak-willed spectator: it just seems reckless for theatres to put temptation in the way of punters like me and provide a break where we can slip out. So I welcome the implicit understanding in cinema that no matter how long or how bad a film is, you'll sit tight to the bitter end. </p> <p>On the whole, intermissions are alien to cinema-going. The Rio cinema in London is currently showing the three-hour Magnolia in two halves, breaking after reel five of a 10-reeler. It's not done to sell more orange-juice: it's just that the cinema has an old-fashioned \"tower\" projection system that can only show up to 156 minutes at one go. </p> <p>Three-hour mainstream films are now so common (The Green Mile; Meet Joe Black) that the studios seem to have developed a touching faith in the capacity of audiences' attentions and bladders. There isn't a natural narrative break in Magnolia, and in a sense, its rather fatiguing relentlessness is part of the appeal. Maybe I could have used that breather, but the film is more effective without it. </p> <p>The last film I saw with a scheduled break was the 222-minute Lawrence of Arabia, re-released some 10 years ago. The intermission was an integral part of the film's his tory: on its release in 1962, audiences who'd been staring at sand dunes for two hours caused an unprecedented boom in ice-cream sales. But in many countries, cinemas routinely interrupt standard-length films, and in Britain, some cinemas even quite recently used to do it for the confectionery revenue, at the risk of being caught out by the Society of Film Distributors. </p> <p>The hardcore art-house crowd might recoil at such interruptions, but concessions are often made to the standard rhythms of human attention. Even among legendarily long films, few demand unbroken viewing: Peter Greenaway's 185-minute mock-documentary The Falls used to be billed with the proviso that people could walk in and out. You wouldn't sit watching Andy Warhol's film of the Empire State for eight hours straight, any more than you'd stare at the actual building for that time. Even the notoriously gruelling seven-hour Hungarian film Satantango was shown in New York with two intervals (presumably with gall-and-wormwood liqueurs available in the bar). </p> <p>Given that we're increasingly attuned to the fragmentary rhythms of video and DVD viewing, it can't be long before Hollywood starts to make films with ad breaks pro-grammed in, or ever more formless epics you can wander in and out of when you get the munchies, or when a car chase goes on too long. </p> <p>Perhaps the uninterrupted session will soon be for aesthetes only. After all, you don't sit and read a novel without a break (although the late American comedian Andy Kaufman used to drive audiences to despair with uninterrupted recitals of The Great Gatsby). Come to think of it, a non-stop Proust marathon has potential. You'd need the odd break, but think how many madeleines they could shift in the caf\u00e9.</p>",
