I thought the referee was a disgrace.\" </p> <p>It's a cruel game and here are the figures to prove it. Ipswich had 16 shots on target to Wolves's three. Ipswich may lack wingers but they still found ways around a Wolves team forced to spend much of the game lined up just outside their penalty area. Michael Oakes had to make some athletic saves, but Tony Mowbray, when offered a free header early in the second half, failed to test him. </p> <p>File this result under aberration, then; like Charlton even the best and bravest should be allowed one.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You could sniff the air around Molineux on Saturday evening and imagine that the auguries are evil for Ipswich. They swarmed all over Wolves but had nothing to show for it after running into Haavard Flo at the moment he came good and a referee whose unsteady judgment turned against them at the game's critical moment. James Scowcroft had pulled a goal back after Flo had struck twice from unpromising positions when five minutes from the end Richard Naylor spun round Kevin Muscat in the penalty area and tumbled over an outstretched leg. The linesman raised his flag, but Michael Jones waved play on. Muscat himself, if Scowcroft is to be believed, said: \"How he hasn't given that I don't know.\" George Burley did not know either. \"Everybody in the ground saw it was a penalty,\" said the Ipswich manager. \"I thought it was a disgrace. I thought the referee was a disgrace.\" It's a cruel game and here are the figures to prove it. Ipswich had 16 shots on target to Wolves's three. Ipswich may lack wingers but they still found ways around a Wolves team forced to spend much of the game lined up just outside their penalty area. Michael Oakes had to make some athletic saves, but Tony Mowbray, when offered a free header early in the second half, failed to test him. File this result under aberration, then; like Charlton even the best and bravest should be allowed one.",

      "body": "<p>The big battalions are now lined up with intent to contest the third Champions League place, but the only sound this weekend has been of opportunities spurned. </p> <p>Home draws for Chelsea and Liverpool presented Arsenal with a chance to go third had they beaten Middlesborough yesterday. But shorn of their all-English backline, plus the England goalkeeper David Seaman who departed at half-time, they lacked the resourcefulness to prosper. </p> <p>If Middlesbrough's first goal, scored by Paul Ince three minutes into the second-half, ended a vague Arsenal ascendancy, then the second from Hamilton Ricard came when Arsenal's defensive chaos was at its height. An exquisite chip from Dennis Bergkamp 20 minutes from time ensured a frantic finale, but no recovery. </p> <p>No away victory since December 4 tells its own story. \"Our inconsistency away from home has cost us the championship,\" said Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e9ne Wenger. \"But the short recovery period after European competition is a nonsense.\" </p> <p>For Wenger, even an enactment of his football fantasy brought no release. He has been among those consulted as Fifa press for uniformity in European seasons and contends that summer football will become inevitable with England adopting a close season between November and February. </p> <p>Teesside could not quite deliver summer but spring was abundant. The Cleveland Hills shimmered in the distance and Boro fans bared their beer bellies for the first time since September. </p> <p>Fifa will no doubt get its wish - never underestimate the bureaucratic obsession with standardisation - but that ignores the fact that another mild English winter has been entirely conducive to football and that any rescheduling would make dark winter days even drearier. Wenger would probably pass them on a tropical beach. </p> <p>This was a strange Arsenal: Emmanuel Petit back in central defence and Nigel Winterburn, complete with captain's armband, in central midfield. Neither looked happy. </p> <p>The greatest surprise of all, however, was to see Ray Parlour imagine himself to be a flying winger between two defenders before thudding a 20-yard shot against Mark Schwarzer's right-hand post. </p> <p>Arsenal's aerial shortcomings left them vulnerable against the likes of Ricard and Brian Deane. Twice Deane rose above Silvinho to meet crosses from the left, but his first header was grabbed by Seaman at the second attempt and his second flew wide. </p> <p>However, Arsenal had most of the few creative moments before half-time. Thierry Henry, released by Nwankwo Kanu, shot against Schwarzer's legs and Kanu then almost stole in at the near post. </p> <p>They never looked as impressive again. Seaman did not resume because of a cricked neck (the danger of a sloppy 70s hairstyle) and Alex Manninger had a tortuous start, beaten almost immediately by Ince's back-header after Curtis Fleming had headed back Christian Ziege's half-cleared corner. </p> <p>Manninger then had no option but to fall on Freddie Ljungberg's back pass - Ziege blazing a hasty free kick over at the second attempt - and conceded a second goal when Andy Campbell's energy forced a wild pass inside from Patrick Vieira and Ricard nut megged Petit before finishing with rare subtlety. </p> <p>Manninger's double-save from Ricard lifted his spirits and Arsenal could point to a disallowed goal for Henry and a possible penalty when Steve Vickers handled Petit's cross to claim that only their luck, not their spirits, was awry. That away record does not support their contention.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The big battalions are now lined up with intent to contest the third Champions League place, but the only sound this weekend has been of opportunities spurned. Home draws for Chelsea and Liverpool presented Arsenal with a chance to go third had they beaten Middlesborough yesterday. But shorn of their all-English backline, plus the England goalkeeper David Seaman who departed at half-time, they lacked the resourcefulness to prosper. If Middlesbrough's first goal, scored by Paul Ince three minutes into the second-half, ended a vague Arsenal ascendancy, then the second from Hamilton Ricard came when Arsenal's defensive chaos was at its height. An exquisite chip from Dennis Bergkamp 20 minutes from time ensured a frantic finale, but no recovery. No away victory since December 4 tells its own story. \"Our inconsistency away from home has cost us the championship,\" said Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e9ne Wenger. \"But the short recovery period after European competition is a nonsense.\" For Wenger, even an enactment of his football fantasy brought no release. He has been among those consulted as Fifa press for uniformity in European seasons and contends that summer football will become inevitable with England adopting a close season between November and February. Teesside could not quite deliver summer but spring was abundant. The Cleveland Hills shimmered in the distance and Boro fans bared their beer bellies for the first time since September. Fifa will no doubt get its wish - never underestimate the bureaucratic obsession with standardisation - but that ignores the fact that another mild English winter has been entirely conducive to football and that any rescheduling would make dark winter days even drearier. Wenger would probably pass them on a tropical beach. This was a strange Arsenal: Emmanuel Petit back in central defence and Nigel Winterburn, complete with captain's armband, in central midfield. Neither looked happy. The greatest surprise of all, however, was to see Ray Parlour imagine himself to be a flying winger between two defenders before thudding a 20-yard shot against Mark Schwarzer's right-hand post. Arsenal's aerial shortcomings left them vulnerable against the likes of Ricard and Brian Deane. Twice Deane rose above Silvinho to meet crosses from the left, but his first header was grabbed by Seaman at the second attempt and his second flew wide. However, Arsenal had most of the few creative moments before half-time. Thierry Henry, released by Nwankwo Kanu, shot against Schwarzer's legs and Kanu then almost stole in at the near post. They never looked as impressive again. Seaman did not resume because of a cricked neck (the danger of a sloppy 70s hairstyle) and Alex Manninger had a tortuous start, beaten almost immediately by Ince's back-header after Curtis Fleming had headed back Christian Ziege's half-cleared corner. Manninger then had no option but to fall on Freddie Ljungberg's back pass - Ziege blazing a hasty free kick over at the second attempt - and conceded a second goal when Andy Campbell's energy forced a wild pass inside from Patrick Vieira and Ricard nut megged Petit before finishing with rare subtlety. Manninger's double-save from Ricard lifted his spirits and Arsenal could point to a disallowed goal for Henry and a possible penalty when Steve Vickers handled Petit's cross to claim that only their luck, not their spirits, was awry. That away record does not support their contention.",

This performance will help raise his spirits but the Spurs manager's search for strikers goes on. He praised Armstrong, said his performance belied the criticism but did not pretend he was the answer.

      "body": "<p>The government often accuses the media of being obsessed with covering spin and government presentation, to the exclusion of issues of substance. But it's a criticism that's strange from this government, which believes in the crucial importance of presentation.</p> <p>In tonight's Panorama, Spin Doctors, we examine the use of spin in the NHS. John Ware reports how the use of PR has become not just an issue of media manipulation, but of direct relevance to the formation of policy. He concludes that the inflation of spending claims by the government has increased expectations of what Labour has done for the NHS since it came to office.</p> <p>That meant that when the January NHS crisis hit the prime minster had to dip into his war chest to con vince the public that he was serious about changing the NHS. Now, that pledge has been downgraded to an aspiration, and the spin doctors are in a fierce debate trying to massage expectations of what Blair's promises on the David Frost programme meant.</p> <p>Labour's concentration on presentation is vividly captured in Panorama's interview with Romola Christopherson, the former head of communications at the department of health. She says: `I think they have devoted an enormous amount of energy to that communications drive.' She reveals that she warned against the notorious triple counting involved in the government's announcement of a three year, \u00a321bn spending plan on the NHS.</p> <p>Christopherson says: `I certainly had reservations about it . . . The accusations of triple counting and the use of mirrors were accusations that I could anticipate.' She says she alerted ministers to the potential criticism, but in the end they decided to go ahead.</p> <p>Like the Clinton team, Campbell and company are advocates of the `permanent campaign'. Blair has even described the war in Kosovo as having elements of a political campaign and he believes that an essential part of a campaign is good presentation.</p> <p>In last night's BBC2 retrospective on Kosovo, Moral Combat, he told Allan Little: `It wasn't just a military campaign, it was also a propaganda campaign and we had to take our public opinions with us . . . I felt a bit like, you know, at the beginning of a big political campaign.'</p> <p>If the Kosovo war was like a political campaign, Christopherson goes further. She says that for New Labour everything is like an election campaign: `I think they really have been in a campaigning mode, interestingly enough from virtually day one of getting into power.'</p> <p>One of the tenets of that philosophy is that most voters pay almost no attention to political news, so to get messages through, they have to be repeated ad nauseam. Christopherson reveals the thinking: `I remember Alastair Campbell saying: `By the time you and me have got absolutely fed up to the back teeth with repetition, that's probably when it's beginning to get through to the wider constituency.''</p> <p>Spin Doctors details how \u00a320m for the new instant booking system for NHS patients has been announced on four separate occasions: in September 1998, November 1998, April 1999 and September 1999. On each occasion, the announcements talked of the service being `boosted' or `an extra \u00a320m' or `a \u00a320m boost'. None of the press notices at the time of the three repeated announcements made clear that this money had previously been made available. It is, of course, reasonable for the government to reiterate its message, but is it right when those announcements do not make clear that they are being repeated?</p> <p>Whitehall civil servants have told Panorama that such statements are always cleared directly by ministers, who are keen that the words `modernised', `beacon', `extra' and `boost' are frequently used.</p> <p>Clearly, the media techniques the government employs were used, although probably to a lesser extent, by the Tories in the past. There are also reasonable arguments to make for the professional implementation of information and you might expect to hear the health secretary making that case on tonight's programme. But, as we say in the trade, `he declined to appear'.</p> <p>The battle over interviews is a vital one for broadcasters. Print can get away with not having on-the-record quotes, but TV and radio need interviewees. It is of particular importance for current affairs programmes to call the powerful to account. But ministers are increasingly careful about when to appear. It is no use researchers and producers arguing with government press officers that the public interest would be served by them coming on. They invariably ask: `What's in it for us?'</p> <p>Of course, the Conservatives played this game very hard too. When I edited Newsnight from 1994 to 1997, predominantly in the Conservative era, government press officers would insist that ministers would not discuss directly with their Labour shadows. They wanted to be `lone and last'.</p> <p>Labour, naturally, complained bitterly to us about the injustice of this, but the moment they were in power they immediately instituted a similar system. Just count the number of times that a minister discusses directly with his or her opposite number on Today or Newsnight. It's very much the exception.</p> <p>For a pre-recorded programme, such as Panorama, the interviewing game is played at least as toughly. Cabinet ministers make a calculation about whether they want to appear. If they feel that a particular programme has little in it for them they may well put up a junior minister or decide that no one will appear.</p> <p>As well as considering the merits of each case, the departments also take into account the track record of each programme. In some cases, New Labour can be very open. For instance, Downing Street has just announced that they will be granting access to Michael Cockerell to make a film about Number Ten's media operation. But Panorama is now very much out of favour (and this article won't help, but there you are).</p> <p>Panorama's main offence has been three programmes we have done in the past year looking at devolution and Labour selection procedures in Wales, Scotland and London.

      "bodyText": "The government often accuses the media of being obsessed with covering spin and government presentation, to the exclusion of issues of substance. But it's a criticism that's strange from this government, which believes in the crucial importance of presentation. In tonight's Panorama, Spin Doctors, we examine the use of spin in the NHS. John Ware reports how the use of PR has become not just an issue of media manipulation, but of direct relevance to the formation of policy. He concludes that the inflation of spending claims by the government has increased expectations of what Labour has done for the NHS since it came to office. That meant that when the January NHS crisis hit the prime minster had to dip into his war chest to con vince the public that he was serious about changing the NHS. Now, that pledge has been downgraded to an aspiration, and the spin doctors are in a fierce debate trying to massage expectations of what Blair's promises on the David Frost programme meant. Labour's concentration on presentation is vividly captured in Panorama's interview with Romola Christopherson, the former head of communications at the department of health. She says: `I think they have devoted an enormous amount of energy to that communications drive.' She reveals that she warned against the notorious triple counting involved in the government's announcement of a three year, \u00a321bn spending plan on the NHS. Christopherson says: `I certainly had reservations about it . . . The accusations of triple counting and the use of mirrors were accusations that I could anticipate.' She says she alerted ministers to the potential criticism, but in the end they decided to go ahead. Like the Clinton team, Campbell and company are advocates of the `permanent campaign'. Blair has even described the war in Kosovo as having elements of a political campaign and he believes that an essential part of a campaign is good presentation. In last night's BBC2 retrospective on Kosovo, Moral Combat, he told Allan Little: `It wasn't just a military campaign, it was also a propaganda campaign and we had to take our public opinions with us . . . I felt a bit like, you know, at the beginning of a big political campaign.' If the Kosovo war was like a political campaign, Christopherson goes further. She says that for New Labour everything is like an election campaign: `I think they really have been in a campaigning mode, interestingly enough from virtually day one of getting into power.' One of the tenets of that philosophy is that most voters pay almost no attention to political news, so to get messages through, they have to be repeated ad nauseam. Christopherson reveals the thinking: `I remember Alastair Campbell saying: `By the time you and me have got absolutely fed up to the back teeth with repetition, that's probably when it's beginning to get through to the wider constituency.'' Spin Doctors details how \u00a320m for the new instant booking system for NHS patients has been announced on four separate occasions: in September 1998, November 1998, April 1999 and September 1999. On each occasion, the announcements talked of the service being `boosted' or `an extra \u00a320m' or `a \u00a320m boost'. None of the press notices at the time of the three repeated announcements made clear that this money had previously been made available. It is, of course, reasonable for the government to reiterate its message, but is it right when those announcements do not make clear that they are being repeated? Whitehall civil servants have told Panorama that such statements are always cleared directly by ministers, who are keen that the words `modernised', `beacon', `extra' and `boost' are frequently used. Clearly, the media techniques the government employs were used, although probably to a lesser extent, by the Tories in the past. There are also reasonable arguments to make for the professional implementation of information and you might expect to hear the health secretary making that case on tonight's programme. But, as we say in the trade, `he declined to appear'. The battle over interviews is a vital one for broadcasters. Print can get away with not having on-the-record quotes, but TV and radio need interviewees. It is of particular importance for current affairs programmes to call the powerful to account. But ministers are increasingly careful about when to appear. It is no use researchers and producers arguing with government press officers that the public interest would be served by them coming on. They invariably ask: `What's in it for us?' Of course, the Conservatives played this game very hard too. When I edited Newsnight from 1994 to 1997, predominantly in the Conservative era, government press officers would insist that ministers would not discuss directly with their Labour shadows. They wanted to be `lone and last'. Labour, naturally, complained bitterly to us about the injustice of this, but the moment they were in power they immediately instituted a similar system. Just count the number of times that a minister discusses directly with his or her opposite number on Today or Newsnight. It's very much the exception. For a pre-recorded programme, such as Panorama, the interviewing game is played at least as toughly. Cabinet ministers make a calculation about whether they want to appear. If they feel that a particular programme has little in it for them they may well put up a junior minister or decide that no one will appear. As well as considering the merits of each case, the departments also take into account the track record of each programme. In some cases, New Labour can be very open. For instance, Downing Street has just announced that they will be granting access to Michael Cockerell to make a film about Number Ten's media operation. But Panorama is now very much out of favour (and this article won't help, but there you are). Panorama's main offence has been three programmes we have done in the past year looking at devolution and Labour selection procedures in Wales, Scotland and London. The programme broadcast in December, The Blair Mayor Project, examined how the Labour party's London membership lists came to make their way from Millbank to Frank Dobson's campaign. Margaret McDonagh, Labour's general secretary, complained about the programme repeatedly both in advance and after transmission. However, despite being responsible for the implementation of the rules for Labour's selection contests, she has always refused to be interviewed on this subject (or indeed on any other). That does not prevent her complaining of bias. Of course, it might be that the perceived bias could be ameliorated by her appearing and making her case, but she decides not to. The BBC is then left in the Kafkaesque situation of responding to a complaint of bias, to which we cannot reply: `Well, why didn't you just come on the programme and explain yourself?' Our duty is to be fair, irrespective of whether interviewees appear. This history of complaints against the programme certainly impedes us in our dealings with the highly co-ordinated government information machine. When BBC current affairs was making the Kosovo programme Moral Combat, we requested an interview with Blair, an interview which, given the outcome of the war, would probably be relatively benign for the government. After many weeks, we had heard nothing from Downing Street. We then spoke to a press officer who explained the hold up. `We thought you were something to do with Panorama.' We explained that the programme was on BBC2 and was not therefore a Panorama. `Oh, that's all right then' said the press officer and the interview went ahead. It no longer shocks me that the government machine plays such a blatant `favourites game'. But it may surprise viewers who believe that decisions about the presentation of information and the appearance of ministers on programmes is part of a compact with the public about their right to have information presented fairly and defended openly.

Experienced staff were made to feel unwelcome in the new school and were turned down for jobs. Rather than \"benefiting\" from new personnel, the school suffered from lack of continuity. Stability and structure were sacrificed for soundbite. The result was chaos - increased truancy, vandalism and discipline problems. It was not a fight last October over a bag of chips that defeated Mr Friedag. He was a victim of the very politics he so eagerly embraced - the attempt to blame teachers and unions for poor results rather than direct resources to where they are most needed. There was an alternative: to bring in new staff to work alongside George Orwell staff without the chaos of closure and reopening. Staff, parents and pupils could have spent \u00a38m building a successful comprehensive school with the interests of pupils, not political spin-doctoring, at heart.

The lonely one's four-day strike came to an end today as he agreed to train for Real Madrid. By himself, naturally. Nic will also have to explain his constant sulking at an extraordinary meeting with the club's directors this evening. He is expected to tell that nice Lorenzo Sanz that it's all Steve McManaman's fault.</p> <p>However, it seems that the man with more self-confidence than a bunch of bankers at the races could be heading for a fall. Madrid coach Vincente del Bosque has said: \"He is just confused, lives in a world of his own and will have to get out of it,\" while Sanz, the club's chairman has declared Lonely Nic to be of unsound mind. \"Something does not turn around properly in his head, \" said Sanz this weekend, \"and we must make sure that it turns around.\"</p> <p>The Spanish press suggests that to achieve this goal, Real will fine Nic a quarter of his annual salary (probably about \u00a31,000,000,000m) for his recent misdemeanours. Rumours also have the man whose best friends are ghosts on the move to Marseille in the summer for \u00a37m. Another solution could be to drill a little hole in Lonely Nic's skull and attach some kind of handle. Not only would this control his temperamental urges but it would also provide something to hold on to in the (unlikely) event of Nic straying into an offside position.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Liverpool are at the head of the queue to sign 18-year-old River Plate starlet Andreas D'Allessandro.</p> <p>Mark Viduka will not be leaving Celtic, according to his agent.

Smith believes that the trio, along with fellow thirty-something John Collins, can add some necessary savvy to the side. \"We need a more experienced player up front,\" he said. \"And Mark is one of those who has an influence on players around him.\" Francis Jeffers was gluing on a chest wig at the time of going to press. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I can enjoy my time out with the wife a bit more than usual tonight.\" Profligate Spurs striker Chris Armstrong after scoring twice at the weekend. You wonder whether his wife has him on some sort of incentive scheme. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NURSE! THE TREPANNING EQUIPMENT! The Fiver wonders whether Nicolas Anelka will still be playing football at 41. The lonely one's four-day strike came to an end today as he agreed to train for Real Madrid. By himself, naturally. Nic will also have to explain his constant sulking at an extraordinary meeting with the club's directors this evening. He is expected to tell that nice Lorenzo Sanz that it's all Steve McManaman's fault. However, it seems that the man with more self-confidence than a bunch of bankers at the races could be heading for a fall. Madrid coach Vincente del Bosque has said: \"He is just confused, lives in a world of his own and will have to get out of it,\" while Sanz, the club's chairman has declared Lonely Nic to be of unsound mind. \"Something does not turn around properly in his head, \" said Sanz this weekend, \"and we must make sure that it turns around.\" The Spanish press suggests that to achieve this goal, Real will fine Nic a quarter of his annual salary (probably about \u00a31,000,000,000m) for his recent misdemeanours. Rumours also have the man whose best friends are ghosts on the move to Marseille in the summer for \u00a37m. Another solution could be to drill a little hole in Lonely Nic's skull and attach some kind of handle. Not only would this control his temperamental urges but it would also provide something to hold on to in the (unlikely) event of Nic straying into an offside position. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Liverpool are at the head of the queue to sign 18-year-old River Plate starlet Andreas D'Allessandro. Mark Viduka will not be leaving Celtic, according to his agent. The Australian striker had been linked with a move to various Premiership sides, but says his representative Bernie Mandic: \"I keep getting asked what the situation is with Mark Viduka at Celtic and I keep telling them he has got another three years to go at Parkhead.\" Middlesbrough are not expected to sign Juninho on a permanent basis after the Brazilian's less than scintillating form since his return to the Riverside. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Norwich City's statement on the resignation of Bruce Rioch. \"Following an approach from first team manager Bruce Rioch and subsequent discussion, the Board and the first team manager have agreed to end his contract with the club with immediate effect. Whilst the Board was surprised and disappointed at this development, which was not expected, the Board and Bruce agree that it is now in the best interests of the club and Bruce to part company.\" Sunderland and Scotland winger Allan Johnston has signed a pre-contract agreement with Glasgow Rangers. \"Everyone knows I have supported Rangers since I was a boy, \" said Johnston, \"This is a dream come true for me.\" Kanu has signed his new contract at Arsenal, thought to be worth around \u00a325,000-a-week. Sheffield United midfielder Michael Brown, 23, and Stockport defender Tony Dinning, 24, have been charged with public order offences following an incident in The Living Room bar in Manchester. * * * * * * * * * * * * * MMMMMM, HOLIDAYS We're on the ball! travelstore.com, the new revolutionary online travel service offers complete online flight, car and hotel booking facilities. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Sports Show (11.30pm) Can anyone imagine Eamonn Holmes playing a sport?

Why do you ask? </p> <p> <strong> Any driving-test tales?</strong> </p> <p> Of course not. I passed first time without incident. </p> <p> <strong> What was your first car?</strong> </p> <p> A 1958 Ford Anglia. It was brown, which helped disguise the rust. </p> <p> <strong> Have you ever crashed/got a speeding ticket/got any points?</strong> </p> <p> I was involved in a collision with an articulated lorry in the above vehicle. The car was a mess, but it spawned one of my finest songs to date, Incident on the Snake Pass. Fortunately, my injuries were superficial. Having said that, to me they were very real. </p> <p> <strong> What do you use your car for?</strong> </p> <p> A shop at Netto, and daily runs to the reservoir to check the water level. </p> <p> <strong> Have you ever experienced road rage?</strong> </p> <p> In Netto's car park I once saw a woman nutting the steering-wheel. I thought, Oh dear, she's forgotten a major item off her list. Then I realised she was just trying to pull her seat forward. </p> <p> <strong> What sort of state is your car in?</strong> </p> <p> Frankly, it's beginning to niff a bit. I left a slice of gala pie in the glove compartment two weeks ago. </p> <p> <strong> What else is in the glove compartment?</strong> </p> <p> A road atlas, spare batteries for my organ and a pair of wellies, just in case the reservoir requires a closer look. </p> <p> <strong> Have you ever had any romantic encounters in a car?</strong> </p> <p> Once my wife Mary came with me to check the reservoir level. It was abnormally low, and we became concerned for our children's futures.

      "bodyText": "What are you driving? An Austin Ambassador - Y reg, beige exterior, maroon interior. What does that say about you? I have immaculate taste and a keen sense of colour coordination. What do you like about it/not like about it? Roomy glove compartment - but the catch is broken, preventing access to the glove compartment. Why did you buy it? I have asked myself that occasionally. What kind of driver are you? Cautious, yet swift to react in moments of danger. Any bad habits? I make soft clucking noises when measuring a piece of timber prior to sawing. Why do you ask? Any driving-test tales? Of course not. I passed first time without incident. What was your first car? A 1958 Ford Anglia. It was brown, which helped disguise the rust. Have you ever crashed/got a speeding ticket/got any points? I was involved in a collision with an articulated lorry in the above vehicle. The car was a mess, but it spawned one of my finest songs to date, Incident on the Snake Pass. Fortunately, my injuries were superficial. Having said that, to me they were very real. What do you use your car for? A shop at Netto, and daily runs to the reservoir to check the water level. Have you ever experienced road rage? In Netto's car park I once saw a woman nutting the steering-wheel. I thought, Oh dear, she's forgotten a major item off her list. Then I realised she was just trying to pull her seat forward. What sort of state is your car in? Frankly, it's beginning to niff a bit. I left a slice of gala pie in the glove compartment two weeks ago. What else is in the glove compartment? A road atlas, spare batteries for my organ and a pair of wellies, just in case the reservoir requires a closer look. Have you ever had any romantic encounters in a car? Once my wife Mary came with me to check the reservoir level. It was abnormally low, and we became concerned for our children's futures. I put my arm round Mary and gave her a reassuring squeeze. What music do you listen to on the road? That's easy: Chris Rea. And, for high-speed motorway journeys, the Lighthouse Family. What would be your dream car? A camper van like Doreen Melody's (She's a good friend of Mary's; they go to Bums, Tums and Thighs together on Thursdays) with a sturdy chrome ladder for immediate access to the roof, and a stove for brewing up during longer visits to the reservoir. Who would be your dream passenger? Chris Rea. I'd like to drive him home for Christmas. Graham Fellows, aka John Shuttleworth, tours his new show, 2000 &amp; John, from Friday.",

A pop-art, 70s-kitsch S&amp;M dungeon with pools of excessively bright light amid dense shadows, the Korova was designed by John Barry (not the composer) and was one of the few sets built for Kubrick's notorious film, re-released on Friday after an absence of 26 years. </p> <p>Apart from two other interior sets, A Clockwork Orange was filmed on location in and around London. The immediate reason was cost: the film's budget was $2m, chicken-feed in Kubrick's terms, even in 1971. Yet, at the time, the locations that would best express the dystopian world Alex and his droogs inhabited had just been built by architects, most of them employed by local authorities. If the Korova had existed it would have been somewhere in the Tavy Bridge shopping centre, Thamesmead, London SE28. </p> <p>The postcode is real, London's most extreme in numerical terms. This is where Alex lives in one of the concrete \"neighbourhood\" blocks linked by elevated walkways. It was underneath one of these, by the shopping centre, that Kubrick filmed the droogs attacking an old tramp. Later, when Alex (played by Malcolm McDowell) becomes the subject of medical research at the \"Ludovico Institute\", he is really in Brunel university, Uxbridge, another brand-new concrete megastructure. </p> <p>Kubrick and his designers found the sets by trawling through the latest architectural magazines. These were mostly in love with Thamesmead. Naturally the mini-new town, planned from 1961 by the London County Council and built from 1965 by the architects department of the Greater London Council, won awards. </p> <p>Thamesmead, a name chosen by readers of the now defunct London Evening News, was designed as a brave new home for 60,000 lucky Londoners, who were to live in a cluster of ostensibly rational, pre-fabricated concrete \"neighbourhoods\". Each neighbourhood would offer between 1,500 and 1,700 \"dwelling units\" for between 8,000 and 9,000 residents. Neighbourhoods would be connected, South Bank style, by elevated walkways, and meet in a large civic piazza with a shopping centre. The site, east of Woolwich and Plumstead marshes, is on wet ground, squeezed up beside the old Crosswell sewage treatment plant where the fine Victorian steam compound rotative beam engine that pumped London's effluence from its centres of population is now being lovingly restored. </p> <p>More than 30 years on, Thamesmead itself would benefit from a little tender loving. In parts it looks like a film set, so strange is the town-planning premise on which it is founded. Concrete towers, flanked by two artificial lakes, rise around a set-piece square facing the Thames. This original core is then wrapped around with the sort of tweedy, bricky, neo-nothing family houses many of us fear will swamp the banks of the Thames as John Prescott's London overspill housing policy is translated into action. The strangest views of the area are those you can get from a boat heading towards Southend and the Channel, or those framed by the ruins of the abbey built from 1191 by Sir Richard de Lucy as a penance for the murder of St Thomas \u00e0 Beckett. </p> <p>What is striking about the locations chosen for A Clockwork Orange and other films documenting alienation is that they were meant to enhance human life. Today only the herons, swans and geese that haunt the lakes and riverside at Thamesmead seem serene. These and the carp and tench that idle through the dark waters of the lakes created by the GLC's landscape gardeners. And maybe those families in search of a four-bedroom detached home with 30ft lounge, double garage and front and back gardens for under \u00a3120,000 (there are plenty of them). The price they pay, if they commute (and most do) is a long bus ride, or an uncertain journey by train to London Bridge. This and a catalogue of worries to do with crime, schooling, the usual things. And a very specific sense of isolation. </p> <p>One of the criticisms of Thamesmead and towns like it is that they are fundamentally middle-class constructs imposed on what were, at the time of their first building, working-class families. Those who first came here had given up life in inner-city streets. True, these were classified as slums, yet they were \"home\" in the sense that Thamesmead has never been. </p> <p>Well-intentioned GLC architects and planners (several of those who worked on the design of Thamesmead had previously helped to develop London's South Bank) were genuinely surprised when residents said there was nowhere for children to play. What about the 300 acres of parks the GLC had generously provided? That wasn't the point. Previously children had been able to kick balls around local streets and alleys. The idea was that the middle classes would come here too, but they never really did. Thamesmead remains solidly Old Labour, despite being a new town. In the May 1997 election, the turnout was 66%. Labour held the seat with 62% of the vote. The extreme right-wing vote was low, with the British National Party wooing just 1.7%. </p> <p>The working-class nature of Thamesmead was sympathetically depicted in the 1996 film of Jonathan Harvey's play Beautiful Thing - though it stressed the lack of privacy so many people felt growing up in the world Alex and the droogs knew. In that future everything was exposed, up-front and violent. No secrets. How different, how very different from life lived behind the screen of privets in middle-class suburbs. </p> <p>One could not say that Thamesmead was in any way cynical, a form of middle-class or local-government manipulation of the lives of those way down the pecking order. It wasn't. Nor was it cheap. A fortune was spent in the first five years (1965-70). Local government was a costly business in the 60s because there was a consensus that new housing, schools, hospitals, parks and other amenities were needed and that these could not, should not, be left in the hands of the private sector. Certainly the private sector would never attempt to build a housing development as complex and costly as Thamesmead. It was true, though, that the concrete flats leaked and were prone to condensation, and the smell of the sewage works on summer days was \"strong enough to peel paint at 50 paces\", according to one local. By 1974 just 12,000 people lived there. Today the population is 30,000 and the mini-new town is considered to be no more than half-complete. After the abolition of the GLC in 1986, it was handed over to Thamesmead Town Limited. Rents are high, residents say, and services are poor. </p> <p>But at least Thamesmead was built with some sense of vision - however misguided. Nowadays, business parks, distribution depots and Prescott memorial housing threaten the marshlands that give this odd stretch of far-flung London its strangely haunting character and its glorious birds and other wildlife. Maybe it's still a tough and isolated place to live, but it has its \"horrorshow\" side. </p> <p>A Clockword Orange opens on Friday.</p>",

If the Korova had existed it would have been somewhere in the Tavy Bridge shopping centre, Thamesmead, London SE28. The postcode is real, London's most extreme in numerical terms. This is where Alex lives in one of the concrete \"neighbourhood\" blocks linked by elevated walkways. It was underneath one of these, by the shopping centre, that Kubrick filmed the droogs attacking an old tramp. Later, when Alex (played by Malcolm McDowell) becomes the subject of medical research at the \"Ludovico Institute\", he is really in Brunel university, Uxbridge, another brand-new concrete megastructure. Kubrick and his designers found the sets by trawling through the latest architectural magazines. These were mostly in love with Thamesmead. Naturally the mini-new town, planned from 1961 by the London County Council and built from 1965 by the architects department of the Greater London Council, won awards. Thamesmead, a name chosen by readers of the now defunct London Evening News, was designed as a brave new home for 60,000 lucky Londoners, who were to live in a cluster of ostensibly rational, pre-fabricated concrete \"neighbourhoods\". Each neighbourhood would offer between 1,500 and 1,700 \"dwelling units\" for between 8,000 and 9,000 residents. Neighbourhoods would be connected, South Bank style, by elevated walkways, and meet in a large civic piazza with a shopping centre. The site, east of Woolwich and Plumstead marshes, is on wet ground, squeezed up beside the old Crosswell sewage treatment plant where the fine Victorian steam compound rotative beam engine that pumped London's effluence from its centres of population is now being lovingly restored. More than 30 years on, Thamesmead itself would benefit from a little tender loving. In parts it looks like a film set, so strange is the town-planning premise on which it is founded. Concrete towers, flanked by two artificial lakes, rise around a set-piece square facing the Thames. This original core is then wrapped around with the sort of tweedy, bricky, neo-nothing family houses many of us fear will swamp the banks of the Thames as John Prescott's London overspill housing policy is translated into action. The strangest views of the area are those you can get from a boat heading towards Southend and the Channel, or those framed by the ruins of the abbey built from 1191 by Sir Richard de Lucy as a penance for the murder of St Thomas \u00e0 Beckett. What is striking about the locations chosen for A Clockwork Orange and other films documenting alienation is that they were meant to enhance human life. Today only the herons, swans and geese that haunt the lakes and riverside at Thamesmead seem serene. These and the carp and tench that idle through the dark waters of the lakes created by the GLC's landscape gardeners. And maybe those families in search of a four-bedroom detached home with 30ft lounge, double garage and front and back gardens for under \u00a3120,000 (there are plenty of them). The price they pay, if they commute (and most do) is a long bus ride, or an uncertain journey by train to London Bridge. This and a catalogue of worries to do with crime, schooling, the usual things. And a very specific sense of isolation. One of the criticisms of Thamesmead and towns like it is that they are fundamentally middle-class constructs imposed on what were, at the time of their first building, working-class families. Those who first came here had given up life in inner-city streets. True, these were classified as slums, yet they were \"home\" in the sense that Thamesmead has never been. Well-intentioned GLC architects and planners (several of those who worked on the design of Thamesmead had previously helped to develop London's South Bank) were genuinely surprised when residents said there was nowhere for children to play. What about the 300 acres of parks the GLC had generously provided? That wasn't the point. Previously children had been able to kick balls around local streets and alleys. The idea was that the middle classes would come here too, but they never really did. Thamesmead remains solidly Old Labour, despite being a new town. In the May 1997 election, the turnout was 66%. Labour held the seat with 62% of the vote. The extreme right-wing vote was low, with the British National Party wooing just 1.7%. The working-class nature of Thamesmead was sympathetically depicted in the 1996 film of Jonathan Harvey's play Beautiful Thing - though it stressed the lack of privacy so many people felt growing up in the world Alex and the droogs knew. In that future everything was exposed, up-front and violent. No secrets. How different, how very different from life lived behind the screen of privets in middle-class suburbs. One could not say that Thamesmead was in any way cynical, a form of middle-class or local-government manipulation of the lives of those way down the pecking order. It wasn't. Nor was it cheap. A fortune was spent in the first five years (1965-70). Local government was a costly business in the 60s because there was a consensus that new housing, schools, hospitals, parks and other amenities were needed and that these could not, should not, be left in the hands of the private sector. Certainly the private sector would never attempt to build a housing development as complex and costly as Thamesmead. It was true, though, that the concrete flats leaked and were prone to condensation, and the smell of the sewage works on summer days was \"strong enough to peel paint at 50 paces\", according to one local. By 1974 just 12,000 people lived there. Today the population is 30,000 and the mini-new town is considered to be no more than half-complete. After the abolition of the GLC in 1986, it was handed over to Thamesmead Town Limited. Rents are high, residents say, and services are poor. But at least Thamesmead was built with some sense of vision - however misguided. Nowadays, business parks, distribution depots and Prescott memorial housing threaten the marshlands that give this odd stretch of far-flung London its strangely haunting character and its glorious birds and other wildlife. Maybe it's still a tough and isolated place to live, but it has its \"horrorshow\" side. A Clockword Orange opens on Friday.",

      "body": "<p>Running a small weekly journal of opinion presents its editor with the recurring problem: visibility. How, with a limited marketing budget, do you create enough noise to get your opinions noticed? </p> <p>The answer successive editors of the Spectator have come up with is to stir up controversy. Typically, this involves throwing a stone through someone's front window and then waiting behind the hedge for the red-faced resident to appear. </p> <p>This is not a risk-free enterprise, but there is also risk for the red-faced resident. Chasing giggling schoolboys down the street is at best undignified and, at worst, may invite another stone the moment the front door is closed. Often it is best simply to stay put on the sofa and call the glazier the next day. So it is with a slightly heavy heart - and only after three stones - that I stir myself. </p> <p>The missiles that have been lobbed through the Guardian's window recently concern our coverage of Ireland. Something that may have long been apparent to alert Guardian readers has come to the attention of the Spectator's media columnist: that we have, in our editorials, shown a considerable degree of understanding towards the leaders of Sinn Fein as they have attempted the near-impossible task of persuading a movement devoted to violence that democratic politics is a more worthwhile and effective way of resolving the nightmare of conflict in Northern Ireland. We have also been careful to note how the problems the Sinn Fein leaders have with their hardliners are mirrored by the difficulties David Trimble has with his instinctive rejectionists. </p> <p>This is not, you might think, a terribly extreme position. It is, give or take the odd nuance, the position of the British, American and Irish governments. Senior British intelligence sources, policemen and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have shown an engaged interest in our editorials. As a stance on Northern Ireland it might be thought at least as mainstream as, say, the Spectator's sister paper, the Daily Telegraph, which has been resolutely hostile to the peace process from the start. </p> <p>As on most newspapers, our editorial line is settled upon by the leader writers of the day - in our case, generally between four and six in number. Three or four of us have written on Ireland in recent months. The two main writers arrived at broadly the same conclusion about Ireland after years of discussions with different sources on all sides of the political, religious and international divides. </p> <p>At the same time as the leaders have appeared we have run a variety of op-ed pieces on Ireland, many of them notably unsympathetic to Sinn Fein. In the past year we have run pieces by Hugo Young, Roy Hattersley, David Trimble (three times), John Taylor and Seumas Mallon. We have run one piece by Gerry Adams. </p> <p>In addition to this I personally signed up serialisation of Eamonn Collins's account of being in the IRA - a work so detested by the Provos that Collins paid for it with his life. We are now being sued for our coverage of this book by his cousin Micky, accused in the book of being in the IRA. </p> <p>So far, so unremarkable. You may not agree with the editorial line. It may turn out to be wise, we may be made to look foolish. But we have been straight down the middle in our reporting and have deliberately allowed plenty of space to different views. Our editorial line has been honestly arrived at after considerable thought, soul-searching and open discussion. </p> <p>The media commentator of the Spectator, Stephen Glover, thinks otherwise. He made the startling discovery - known, I guess, to all Guardian employees and numerous others in Fleet Street and the worlds of publishing and television - that the deputy editor of the Guardian, Georgina Henry, lives with the author Ronan Bennett, who is open about his support for a united Ireland. After considerable research, Mr Glover chanced upon the singular fact that Georgina was pregnant. </p> <p>Sleuthing further, he found out that Bennett had once been in Long Kesh and had been convicted of the murder of an RUC policeman - though he was just cute enough to concede that Bennett had also subsequently been acquitted. </p> <p>He also told his readers that a serial Bennett had made about the Easter 1916 rising had been rejected by the Irish TV station, RTE, for being \"too sectarian\". </p> <p>All this was almost too exciting to be true, especially when Glover subsequently thought he had discovered that Georgina wrote leaders on Northern Ireland and was in the habit of slagging off our sister paper, the Observer, for being \"dangerously sympathetic to the Unionists\". </p> <p>Bingo! Bennett had not only impregnated Georgina with his baby, he had also succeeded in impregnating her with his sectarian views and - through her - had turned the Guardian into \"an alarmingly pro-IRA\" paper. You doubt that a \"media commentator\" could pen so crude a sub-Freudian analysis of a newspaper? Oh but he did - right down to stating: \"she is pregnant with his child\" [emphasis added]. </p> <p>Moreover, Glover had found out, all this had been done behind the editor's back - though he dangled the theory that I enjoyed the \"chic idea of drinking with Provos\". And all this without us ever telling Guardian readers who Bennett was! The little boys must have hugged themselves with glee as they penned the headline: \"The Republican cell at the heart of the Guardian.\" </p> <p>The problem was that virtually none of it was true. Bennett's serial has not been rejected by RTE. Georgina has never written a leader on Northern Ireland and does not hold the view of the Observer ascribed to her. She had a baby last December (do try to keep up, Mr Glover!), was on maternity leave at the time of the recent editorials that have most offended the Spectator and played absolutely no part in their formulation. </p> <p>The development of the Guardian leader line was emphatically not done behind my back. Bennett's time in Long Kesh was hardly a secret from Guardian readers: he wrote a 2,000-word G2 cover story on the subject in September 1998 (since then he has written precisely one piece for the Guardian - a book review). And no leader writer on the Guardian - myself excepted - has ever discussed Irish politics with Bennett. </p> <p>This was a fairly spectacular list of errors and might be thought to torpedo the entire basis of the piece. It is, as I have discovered, a mistake to try to discuss matters such as this with Glover himself, since he has only a hazy notion of respecting private conversations. So I wrote a long, careful - and private - letter to the magazine's editor, Boris Johnson, asking if he would consider correcting the five main errors. </p> <p>There was a long silence from the Spectator's offices at Doughty Street, so I rang Johnson. He exploded into a string of apologies and conceded they'd got all the \"personal stuff\" wrong. But, pressed for a correction, he got distinctly ratty and described the errors as trivial and \"hair-splitting\". He muttered something about our leaders immediately after the Docklands bomb and promised to write me a letter. </p> <p>No letter arrived. I faxed him our leaders on the Docklands bomb, which unequivocally condemned the IRA. As his deadline neared I rang Johnson again. I could, he said, write a letter but there would be no correction. It transpired during these exchanges that anyone who felt any admiration for anything Adams and McGuinness had done during these past five years was regarded by the Spectator as being \"pro-IRA\". </p> <p>No letter came. The magazine appeared with no correction. Johnson is reputed to have a sense of humour, so I penned a jokey 200-word leader about the matter in which one in every two facts was wrong, and invited readers to guess which was true and which was garbage. </p> <p>Johnson said he loved it and asked if he could repeat some of Glover's accusations in a letter to the Guardian. I said that would be just fine once they corrected all the mistakes in his own magazine. I settled back on the sofa. End of the affair. </p> <p>Wrong. There was still giggling from behind the hedge. Johnson briefed a number of journalists about the \"controversy\" and gained his quota of helpful publicity. Several papers wrote about the \"row\" until Guardian readers were the only ones left out of the loop. Hence this article. </p> <p>He returned to the theme last week, more elegantly than Glover, but still maintaining that the original article was substantially correct (\"if we got anything significantly wrong (and I don't think we did), then I apologise unreservedly\"). It was a more moderate rehearsal of the cell thesis, and we all presumed that was truly the end of the affair. </p> <p>Far from it. This week Glover returned to his sombre duty. Same theme, same headline. The notion that something might be corrected (something the Guardian itself does as a matter of routine and policy four or five times a day) had by now become a sinister inhibition on free speech. Even to ask showed that the Guardian - supposedly a champion of open debate - was \"worse than the Downing Street heavies\". Glover bravely announced that he would not be silenced by these \"threats\". </p> <p>Glover then did what is known in Fleet Street as \"doing a Glover\". He glancingly accepted that he had got some things wrong, while claiming that the real truth was even more significant. For the record, he now accepts that RTE did not, as he originally claimed, reject Bennett's series. He has replaced this with a new claim (\"possibly more illuminating\") - that RTE demanded changes to the script. This, illuminatingly enough, is also untrue. </p> <p>Glover is also happy to accept that Georgina has never written a leader on Northern Ireland. He thinks this a \"minor point\", adding: \"It scarcely matters that her fingers never make contact with the keyboard.\" </p> <p>There is a also an interesting (if unacknowledged) shift in language. Glover has quietly retreated from his deliberate and repeated charges that the Guardian is \"alarming pro-IRA\" to the charge that the Guardian is now \"pro-Sinn Fein/IRA\", or even just plain pro-Sinn Fein. All this is a start. </p> <p>But his dogged researches have turned up fresh outrages. Last year, he reports, Bennett introduced me to Gerry Adams. Bennett did make a call on my behalf - though it was three years ago. I wanted to meet Adams, who at this time was talking freely to the British, American and Irish governments. This is hardly shocking - or new - stuff. The great CP Scott met Michael Collins twice at the time of the October 1921 \"peace process\". He even persuaded him to write for the paper. Imagine the frothy excitement of the media commentators of the day: \"Scott chic: dining with killers!\" </p> <p>I arranged the meeting with Adams through Bennett because I knew he knew Adams and because our then Irish correspondent, David Sharrock, was writing a biography of Adams which he had told me was going to be unsympathetic. But I did ask Sharrock (now the Telegraph's Belfast correspondent) if he could arrange dinner with two leading unionist politicians for the following evening. This he did. It is odd that Glover cannot find room for this detail. </p> <p>Next Glover finds that Jonathan Freedland, this paper's policy editor, and I conducted a \"Pravda\"-like interview with McGuinnesss and \"put him under no pressure about punishment beatings\". </p> <p>This is what McGuinness said on the record about punishment beatings in that interview: \"I think punishment beatings are brutal, and I think they should stop. No matter who's involved. That is my view and it has been my view for some considerable time. Now, I can't make a clearer statement than that. I think they are wrong and I think they should stop.\" Glover could not find room for this quote. </p> <p>And so on. In a sense, this is all missing the point. The Spectator is there as a journal of opinion. It has lots of opinions - many of them irritating, some of them interesting, some barking mad. What it has had trouble with is facts. It often can't get them right and its response when challenged is always to feel persecuted and shout its opinions even louder. </p> <p>If other journalists could learn to realise this is the game they might be slower to rush in with the \"controversy\" stories that the Spectator so badly needs to oxygenate its little band of readers. As for the Guardian's views on Ireland, what you see is what you get. There are no secret cells, no hidden strings. (Before Glover makes an exciting new \"discovery\": Bennett is a friend of mine and we are writing a script together. Not about Ireland which, he may believe it or not, we seldom discuss.) </p> <p>Anyone who doesn't like our views on Ireland is free to damn them. Glover's arrogant mistake is to believe that those who hold different views from his own cannot have arrived at them openly and honestly. </p> <p>I happen to disagree passionately with the Telegraph's views on Ireland. I sometimes think it odd that Charles Moore, its editor, should stand on a political platform in Belfast to denounce the proposed Patten Reforms of the RUC. But I believe he holds his opinions sincerely and honestly and I respect both them and him. And it wouldn't occur to me to ask what his wife thinks about Northern Ireland or whether she has shaped his views. </p> <p>One of Moore's regular contributors and sources on Ireland is the former IRA killer, Sean O'Callaghan, who in 1990 was given a 539-year sentence for two murders and more than 40 other terrorist offences. Unlike Bennett, his convictions were never overturned. Within eight years Moore was paying him a lucrative serialisation fee for his memoirs. He is, I note, a welcome contributor to the pages of the Spectator. </p> <p>In 1993 - long before the current peace process - O'Callaghan was visited in prison by Andrew Neil, then editor of the Sunday Times. In 1994/5 Moore also made the journey to Maghaberry prison to listen to him. The two men got on well. I would be surprised if Glover has not also been seeking his counsel. </p> <p>Bennett's commitment to the peace process is every bit as solid as O'Callaghan's, and Glover can produce no evidence to the contrary. Why, then, is Bennett demonised three weeks running by the Spectator and not O'Callaghan? Is this anything to do with Glover's supposed subject - \"Media Studies\" - or is it simple political prejudice laced with personal venom? </p> <p>But you have to admit, they got me off my sofa. Now, boys, why not find another window?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Running a small weekly journal of opinion presents its editor with the recurring problem: visibility. How, with a limited marketing budget, do you create enough noise to get your opinions noticed? The answer successive editors of the Spectator have come up with is to stir up controversy. Typically, this involves throwing a stone through someone's front window and then waiting behind the hedge for the red-faced resident to appear. This is not a risk-free enterprise, but there is also risk for the red-faced resident. Chasing giggling schoolboys down the street is at best undignified and, at worst, may invite another stone the moment the front door is closed. Often it is best simply to stay put on the sofa and call the glazier the next day. So it is with a slightly heavy heart - and only after three stones - that I stir myself. The missiles that have been lobbed through the Guardian's window recently concern our coverage of Ireland. Something that may have long been apparent to alert Guardian readers has come to the attention of the Spectator's media columnist: that we have, in our editorials, shown a considerable degree of understanding towards the leaders of Sinn Fein as they have attempted the near-impossible task of persuading a movement devoted to violence that democratic politics is a more worthwhile and effective way of resolving the nightmare of conflict in Northern Ireland. We have also been careful to note how the problems the Sinn Fein leaders have with their hardliners are mirrored by the difficulties David Trimble has with his instinctive rejectionists. This is not, you might think, a terribly extreme position. It is, give or take the odd nuance, the position of the British, American and Irish governments. Senior British intelligence sources, policemen and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have shown an engaged interest in our editorials. As a stance on Northern Ireland it might be thought at least as mainstream as, say, the Spectator's sister paper, the Daily Telegraph, which has been resolutely hostile to the peace process from the start.

      "body": "<p> Radio 1 is on a mission. We are looking for six creative and talented young people to come and work with us. We aim to bring the best new music to the widest possible young audience and we have an important role to play in introducing new talent to our listeners. </p> <p>The most important ingredient needed to achieve this is a young, energised and skilled group of people, which includes producers, broadcast assistants, music programmers and, of course, DJs. It's not an easy job because our audiences demand a service from Radio 1 that is in touch, credible and knows what it is talking about. The best way to achieve that is to ensure that there is always fresh, young talent in the team. </p> <p>Since I've been controller, I've wanted to start a Radio 1 trainee scheme that attracts a range of talented young people. The idea is to immerse trainees in the channel's culture and train them in all aspects of the station, whether it be marketing, production or being a DJ. </p> <p>These days so many of the roles have become interchangeable. Zo\u00eb Ball was a researcher on the Big Breakfast, Jo Whiley a journalist and Mark Radcliffe a radio producer. Many of our specialist DJs work in the music industry some way or another, so I did not want to be prescriptive and pigeonhole people from the beginning. </p> <p>This is the sort of scheme that I would have given everything for when I was 20. I was passionate about working in radio from a ludicrously early age (eight, actually). It was not until I was in my 20s that I got a traineeship as a studio manager. The BBC's trainee schemes at the time seemed completely impenetrable. </p> <p>Hopefully, not any more. I feel this new trainee scheme, supported by the Guardian, can provide a point of access for young people and has an important role that can be systematic in its training and talent development. That way, we won't leave the next generation at Radio 1 to chance. </p> <p>The scheme is open to anyone aged 18-25, and each traineeship will last 12 months. In the first six months, each person will spend a short period working in each of the major departments in Radio 1, as well as undergoing formal training in all the digital technologies, editing, music-making and the internet. In the second part of the scheme, each candidate will be placed within a single department or programme. </p> <p>I would like a group of people from really varied backgrounds and their selection will be based solely on their potential, not on any previous radio experience. It will benefit Radio 1 in that it will bring a new perspective and fresh ideas into the station. </p> <p>We took the decision to put the application process on the Radio 1 website. This came about when we were asking current staff and DJs what skills they felt were important to their job. A quick look around the Radio 1 building is enough to show that being computer literate and internet-friendly are very much a part of working life here. The second stage of the application will be designed to draw on each candidate's creative talents and his/her ability, both to generate new and exciting ideas and communicate them effectively. </p> <p>If I were giving advice to people thinking about applying for the scheme, I would tell them to trust their instincts and to be honest when filling in the questionnaire. No two people who work at Radio 1 at the moment share exactly the same talents and experience, and we are looking for the same variety of strengths in the successful trainees. </p> <p>The only unchangeable criteria is that anyone who works here must have an active passion for music, which is why this has become one of the key phrases of the Radio 1 talent campaign. Also, the more they know about the station's output, both in terms of the shows and the music that we play, the more likely they are to be the kind of person we are looking for. I would encourage them not to be put off by the high number of applicants that we are expecting. There are enough different stages to the selection process to ensure their strengths will shine through.</p> <p>To enter the Radio 1 talent scheme, go to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1\">www.bbc.co.uk/radio1</a> or call 0906 5550000. Brochures with details of the scheme are available from sponsors Top Shop, Top Man and Odeon cinemas. They are also available at WH Smith</p>",

      "bodyText": "Radio 1 is on a mission. We are looking for six creative and talented young people to come and work with us. We aim to bring the best new music to the widest possible young audience and we have an important role to play in introducing new talent to our listeners. The most important ingredient needed to achieve this is a young, energised and skilled group of people, which includes producers, broadcast assistants, music programmers and, of course, DJs. It's not an easy job because our audiences demand a service from Radio 1 that is in touch, credible and knows what it is talking about. The best way to achieve that is to ensure that there is always fresh, young talent in the team. Since I've been controller, I've wanted to start a Radio 1 trainee scheme that attracts a range of talented young people. The idea is to immerse trainees in the channel's culture and train them in all aspects of the station, whether it be marketing, production or being a DJ. These days so many of the roles have become interchangeable. Zo\u00eb Ball was a researcher on the Big Breakfast, Jo Whiley a journalist and Mark Radcliffe a radio producer. Many of our specialist DJs work in the music industry some way or another, so I did not want to be prescriptive and pigeonhole people from the beginning. This is the sort of scheme that I would have given everything for when I was 20. I was passionate about working in radio from a ludicrously early age (eight, actually). It was not until I was in my 20s that I got a traineeship as a studio manager. The BBC's trainee schemes at the time seemed completely impenetrable. Hopefully, not any more. I feel this new trainee scheme, supported by the Guardian, can provide a point of access for young people and has an important role that can be systematic in its training and talent development. That way, we won't leave the next generation at Radio 1 to chance. The scheme is open to anyone aged 18-25, and each traineeship will last 12 months. In the first six months, each person will spend a short period working in each of the major departments in Radio 1, as well as undergoing formal training in all the digital technologies, editing, music-making and the internet. In the second part of the scheme, each candidate will be placed within a single department or programme. I would like a group of people from really varied backgrounds and their selection will be based solely on their potential, not on any previous radio experience. It will benefit Radio 1 in that it will bring a new perspective and fresh ideas into the station. We took the decision to put the application process on the Radio 1 website. This came about when we were asking current staff and DJs what skills they felt were important to their job. A quick look around the Radio 1 building is enough to show that being computer literate and internet-friendly are very much a part of working life here. The second stage of the application will be designed to draw on each candidate's creative talents and his/her ability, both to generate new and exciting ideas and communicate them effectively. If I were giving advice to people thinking about applying for the scheme, I would tell them to trust their instincts and to be honest when filling in the questionnaire. No two people who work at Radio 1 at the moment share exactly the same talents and experience, and we are looking for the same variety of strengths in the successful trainees. The only unchangeable criteria is that anyone who works here must have an active passion for music, which is why this has become one of the key phrases of the Radio 1 talent campaign. Also, the more they know about the station's output, both in terms of the shows and the music that we play, the more likely they are to be the kind of person we are looking for. I would encourage them not to be put off by the high number of applicants that we are expecting. There are enough different stages to the selection process to ensure their strengths will shine through. To enter the Radio 1 talent scheme, go to www.bbc.co.uk/radio1 or call 0906 5550000. Brochures with details of the scheme are available from sponsors Top Shop, Top Man and Odeon cinemas. They are also available at WH Smith",

Now, that pledge has been downgraded to an aspiration, and the spin doctors are in a fierce debate trying to massage expectations of what Blair's promises on the David Frost programme meant. </p> <p>Labour's concentration on presentation is vividly captured in Panorama's interview with Romola Christopherson, the former head of communications at the department of health. She says: \"I think they have devoted an enormous amount of energy to that communications drive.\" She reveals that she warned against the notorious triple counting involved in the government's announcement of a three year, \u00a321bn spending plan on the NHS. </p> <p>Christopherson says: \"I certainly had reservations about it . . . The accusations of triple counting and the use of mirrors were accusations that I could anticipate.\" She says she alerted ministers to the potential criticism, but in the end they decided to go ahead. </p> <p>Like the Clinton team, Campbell and company are advocates of the \"permanent campaign\". Blair has even described the war in Kosovo as having elements of a political campaign and he believes that an essential part of a campaign is good presentation. </p> <p>In last night's BBC2 retrospective on Kosovo, Moral Combat, he told Allan Little: \"It wasn't just a military campaign, it was also a propaganda campaign and we had to take our public opinions with us . . . I felt a bit like, you know, at the beginning of a big political campaign.\" </p> <p>If the Kosovo war was like a political campaign, Christopherson goes further.

Christopherson reveals the thinking: \"I remember Alastair Campbell saying: 'By the time you and me have got absolutely fed up to the back teeth with repetition, that's probably when it's beginning to get through to the wider constituency.'\" </p> <p>Spin Doctors details how \u00a320m for the new instant booking system for NHS patients has been announced on four separate occasions: in September 1998, November 1998, April 1999 and September 1999. On each occasion, the announcements talked of the service being \"boosted\" or \"an extra \u00a320m\" or \"a \u00a320m boost\". None of the press notices at the time of the three repeated announcements made clear that this money had previously been made available. It is, of course, reasonable for the government to reiterate its message, but is it right when those announcements do not make clear that they are being repeated? </p> <p>Whitehall civil servants have told Panorama that such statements are always cleared directly by ministers, who are keen that the words \"modernised\", \"beacon\", \"extra\" and \"boost\" are frequently used. </p> <p>Clearly, the media techniques the government employs were used, although probably to a lesser extent, by the Tories in the past. There are also reasonable arguments to make for the professional implementation of information and you might expect to hear the health secretary making that case on tonight's programme. But, as we say in the trade, \"he declined to appear\". </p> <p>The battle over interviews is a vital one for broadcasters. Print can get away with not having on-the-record quotes, but TV and radio need interviewees. It is of particular importance for current affairs programmes to call the powerful to account. But ministers are increasingly careful about when to appear. It is no use researchers and producers arguing with government press officers that the public interest would be served by them coming on. They invariably ask: \"What's in it for us?\" </p> <p> Of course, the Conservatives played this game very hard too. When I edited Newsnight from 1994 to 1997, predominantly in the Conservative era, government press officers would insist that ministers would not discuss directly with their Labour shadows. They wanted to be \"lone and last\". </p> <p>Labour, naturally, complained bitterly to us about the injustice of this, but the moment they were in power they immediately instituted a similar system. Just count the number of times that a minister discusses directly with his or her opposite number on Today or Newsnight. It's very much the exception. </p> <p>For a pre-recorded programme, such as Panorama, the interviewing game is played at least as toughly. Cabinet ministers make a calculation about whether they want to appear. If they feel that a particular programme has little in it for them they may well put up a junior minister or decide that no one will appear. </p> <p>As well as considering the merits of each case, the departments also take into account the track record of each programme. In some cases, New Labour can be very open. For instance, Downing Street has just announced that they will be granting access to Michael Cockerell to make a film about Number Ten's media operation. But Panorama is now very much out of favour (and this article won't help, but there you are). </p> <p>Panorama's main offence has been three programmes we have done in the past year looking at devolution and Labour selection procedures in Wales, Scotland and London. The programme broadcast in December, The Blair Mayor Project, examined how the Labour party's London membership lists came to make their way from Millbank to Frank Dobson's campaign. </p> <p>Margaret McDonagh, Labour's general secretary, complained about the programme repeatedly both in advance and after transmission. However, despite being responsible for the implementation of the rules for Labour's selection contests, she has always refused to be interviewed on this subject (or indeed on any other). </p> <p>That does not prevent her complaining of bias. Of course, it might be that the perceived bias could be ameliorated by her appearing and making her case, but she decides not to. The BBC is then left in the Kafkaesque situation of responding to a complaint of bias, to which we cannot reply: \"Well, why didn't you just come on the programme and explain yourself?\" Our duty is to be fair, irrespective of whether interviewees appear. </p> <p>This history of complaints against the programme certainly impedes us in our dealings with the highly co-ordinated government information machine. When BBC current affairs was making the Kosovo programme Moral Combat, we requested an interview with Blair, an interview which, given the outcome of the war, would probably be relatively benign for the government. </p> <p>After many weeks, we had heard nothing from Downing Street. We then spoke to a press officer who explained the hold up. \"We thought you were something to do with Panorama.\" We explained that the programme was on BBC2 and was not therefore a Panorama. \"Oh, that's all right then\" said the press officer and the interview went ahead. </p> <p>It no longer shocks me that the government machine plays such a blatant \"favourites game\". But it may surprise viewers who believe that decisions about the presentation of information and the appearance of ministers on programmes is part of a compact with the public about their right to have information presented fairly and defended openly. That is increasingly not the case. </p> <p>Peter Horrocks is editor of Panorama and was executive editor of Moral Combat: Nato at War on BBC2. Panorama, the Spin Doctors, is on BBC1 tonight at 10pm.</p>",

They wanted to be \"lone and last\". Labour, naturally, complained bitterly to us about the injustice of this, but the moment they were in power they immediately instituted a similar system. Just count the number of times that a minister discusses directly with his or her opposite number on Today or Newsnight. It's very much the exception. For a pre-recorded programme, such as Panorama, the interviewing game is played at least as toughly. Cabinet ministers make a calculation about whether they want to appear. If they feel that a particular programme has little in it for them they may well put up a junior minister or decide that no one will appear. As well as considering the merits of each case, the departments also take into account the track record of each programme. In some cases, New Labour can be very open. For instance, Downing Street has just announced that they will be granting access to Michael Cockerell to make a film about Number Ten's media operation. But Panorama is now very much out of favour (and this article won't help, but there you are). Panorama's main offence has been three programmes we have done in the past year looking at devolution and Labour selection procedures in Wales, Scotland and London. The programme broadcast in December, The Blair Mayor Project, examined how the Labour party's London membership lists came to make their way from Millbank to Frank Dobson's campaign. Margaret McDonagh, Labour's general secretary, complained about the programme repeatedly both in advance and after transmission. However, despite being responsible for the implementation of the rules for Labour's selection contests, she has always refused to be interviewed on this subject (or indeed on any other). That does not prevent her complaining of bias. Of course, it might be that the perceived bias could be ameliorated by her appearing and making her case, but she decides not to. The BBC is then left in the Kafkaesque situation of responding to a complaint of bias, to which we cannot reply: \"Well, why didn't you just come on the programme and explain yourself?\" Our duty is to be fair, irrespective of whether interviewees appear. This history of complaints against the programme certainly impedes us in our dealings with the highly co-ordinated government information machine. When BBC current affairs was making the Kosovo programme Moral Combat, we requested an interview with Blair, an interview which, given the outcome of the war, would probably be relatively benign for the government. After many weeks, we had heard nothing from Downing Street. We then spoke to a press officer who explained the hold up. \"We thought you were something to do with Panorama.\" We explained that the programme was on BBC2 and was not therefore a Panorama. \"Oh, that's all right then\" said the press officer and the interview went ahead. It no longer shocks me that the government machine plays such a blatant \"favourites game\". But it may surprise viewers who believe that decisions about the presentation of information and the appearance of ministers on programmes is part of a compact with the public about their right to have information presented fairly and defended openly. That is increasingly not the case. Peter Horrocks is editor of Panorama and was executive editor of Moral Combat: Nato at War on BBC2. Panorama, the Spin Doctors, is on BBC1 tonight at 10pm.",

Everybody, it seems, wants a piece of a company that at the 11th hour can get you a flight to Spain or two tickets for the theatre. So much so that by tomorrow night Lastminute.com will be worth - on paper at least - as much as Manchester United, the world's richest football club. </p> <p>The dizzying price tag attached to a company that has been in business for all of 19 months seems a perfect symbol for the giddy mood of affluence that has gripped much of Britain since the words dot com became synonymous with easy money. With a pressure cooker stockmarket fuelling a frenzy of spending, the signs of an 80s-style boom are all around: soaring house prices, roaring sales of the most preposterous luxury goods, and the surest indicator of all, figures for the consumption of champagne that suggest some people are confusing it with sparkling water. </p> <p>But as punters sit and dream of the untold riches that Lastminute.com will bring them, they would do well to ponder four little words - the four most dangerous words in finance. This time it's different. Of course, speculators caught up in the frenzy are not doing any pondering at all. They're sticking to the dreaming. We've had stock market bubbles before, so their argument goes, but they were based on uncontrollable greed and hysteria. This time it's different. We've had stock market bubbles before, but back then there was no Alan Greenspan, the head of America's central bank, to steer us to safety. This time it's different. We've had stock market bubbles before, but that was when companies were run by charlatans and deadbeats rather than dynamic, young entrepreneurs. This time it's different. </p> <p>But what if it isn't? What if this bubble - this wild speculation in companies unheard of six months ago - is about to go the way of all the others, from tulip mania in 17th-century Holland to the Japanese stock market in the late 80s - and end in a spectacular crash? </p> <p>If - or rather when - it happens, it will happen suddenly. And the impact will be savage. Two weeks before the crash of 1929, the New York Times carried a headline: \"Stocks will stay at high level for years to come.\" A week later, when the first signs of a problem were emerging, the eminent Yale economist Irving Fisher, had some soothing words. \"Fisher says prices of stocks are low,\" declared the stately New York daily. In subheadings it added: \"Quotations have not caught up with real values as yet, he declares. Sees no cause for slump.\" </p> <p>A week later came Black Tuesday, when the floor of the New York Stock Exchange descended into pandemonium and dealers tried to offload shares at any price. Stocks that had been previously been the most fashionable - such as Radio Corporation of America - were among the biggest losers. The pages of the Times took on a more sombre tone. </p> <p>Slowly, perhaps too slowly, today's policy makers are starting to wake up to the idea that it could all happen again, that the laws of economics have not been rewritten by Bill Gates et al, and that unless investors tread warily, Lastminute.com could turn into Lastgasp.com. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, last week urged investors to exercise caution, suggesting \"people will want to look at the performance of each of these individual (high-tech) companies.\" </p> <p>Howard Davies, head of the Financial Services Authority, the City's watchdog, was even more blunt, saying: \"When a company is valued more on hope than on expectation, then you can expect it to be a volatile stock. We know from previous experience that many of the companies around at the moment will not be around in three to five years.\" </p> <p>A similar attempt to let the air gently out of the stock market bubble is underway on the other side of the Atlantic, where Greenspan has been nudging up interest rates to slow down America's booming economy. He believes that there has been a renaissance in the US economy, and he's right, but not one that justifies the extraordinary rise in high-tech stocks on Wall Street. A year ago, the Nasdaq index of new technology companies stood at around 2,000; it hit 3,000 in November, 4,000 in December and 5,000 last week. Tim Congdon, one of the City's leading economists calls the valuations on the Nasdaq index \"insane\". Greenspan now has the unenviable task on his hand: how to deflate the bubble without bursting it. </p> <p>Will he be successful? In all honesty, nobody knows. In financial markets everybody is blessed with 20:20 hindsight, but anyone who says they can say precisely when there will be a crash is lying. It could be this year, next year, sometime, never. What can be stated with some justification is that the warnings are justified by historical precedent and that the longer the high-tech frenzy goes on, the shorter the odds on an eventual day of reckoning. </p> <p> Some of the valuations of the high-tech companies look - how shall we put it - somewhat optimistic. Lastminute.com, for example, is expected to have a notional value of \u00a31bn when its shares go on sale today. Its revenues in the last quarter, which included the peak Christmas buying season, totalled \u00a3409,000. So far, what the company has going for it is a bright idea and a good brand, but not that many customers. It is losing money, lots of money. </p> <p>Those who argue - as did Irving Fisher in 1929 - that the market is not over-valued would say that there is nothing wrong with that. Plenty of companies lose money when they are getting the business established, when building up a customer base takes precedence over profitability. Capital investment is expensive and so is advertising. </p> <p>In the end, however, companies that succeed in a market economy are those that make profits. That may sound brutal, but it's a fact of life. A company's share price reflects the profits that investors expect it to make in the future, and eventually they will want to see some signs that those profits are going to be delivered. And here's the rub: not only have the vast majority of the dot.com companies never made a profit, but they are unlikely ever to do so. Why? Because there are too many companies chasing business at a time when profit margins are being squeezed by intense competition. </p> <p>The online market for books is a case in point. Amazon is the market leader in this field, although it, too, has never made a profit. Yet anybody keen to buy a book over the net can log on to a website called <a href=\"http://www.bookbrain.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Bookbrain.co.uk</a>, which will search all the online booksellers and give a rundown of price, delivery times and the cost of packaging and postage. Take Delia's second How to Cook book, for example. This is available for \u00a316.99 from the BBC but much more cheaply online. According to Bookbrain, Amazon has it at \u00a310.94 including p&amp;p, but two other outlets - Alphabetstreet and Country Bookstore are churning it out at \u00a38.49. All this is wonderful news for the consumer, but doesn't do much for the bottom line of Amazon, or any of the other online bookstores. </p> <p>The cannier investors are starting to latch on to this inescapable truth. Last month's stock market darling, <a href=\"http://www.freeserve.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Freeserve,</a> saw a third wiped off its share price last week when it became clear that a price war among internet service providers was bound to cut revenues and profits. </p> <p>While all eyes have been on the go-go stocks in the high-tech sector, shares in so-called old economy companies have been in the doldrums. Brewers, banks, supermarkets, retailers, power companies have been churning out healthy profits, but no one has been even remotely interested in fuddy-duddy companies run by men in suits. For those who believe in happy endings, the hope is that when the bubble bursts for the high-tech sector, the money will simply rotate into the old economy stocks again and the technological revolution - which is for real - will embed itself into the economy without any of the accompanying hype. If that happens, there will be a short period of turbulence, but nothing worse. </p> <p>But there are pessimists who argue that this ignores the factor that has characterised all post-bubble periods - panic. When sentiment turns, it can turn so quickly that policy makers cannot respond quickly enough and by the time remedial measures kick in it is too late. One favourite scenario for the Cassandras is that the determination of America to live beyond its means forces Greenspan to continue ratcheting up interest rates. At some point, companies start reporting that their profits are being affected, leading to a crash in share prices. Foreign investors - up to their necks in Wall Street - suffer big losses, leading to knock-on effects on stock markets around the world. The fall in the stock market then undermines the hitherto strong dollar, affecting exports from Europe and Asia by making them more expensive. In these circumstances, there would be a very nasty global recession, with the strong possibility of falling house prices and the certainty of sharply rising unemployment. </p> <p> The worst-case scenario, of course, would be a full-scale 30s-style slump. This is possible, but still highly improbable unless politicians and central bankers repeat the serious mistakes made in the aftermath of the 1929 crash, when they failed to cut interest rates quickly enough and raised taxes to keep budgets in balance. </p> <p>Graham Turner, economist at GFC economics, said: \"This is not going to be pleasant. But only if prices come down so quickly that they turn negative and we get a period of deflation will policy makers be in serious trouble. Otherwise, we should come out the other side.\" He added that the likeliest outcome was that the men in suits at the old economy companies would have the last laugh. \"A lot of internet companies will be swallowed up by traditional firms, who will be able to cherry pick the best brand names at the bottom of the market. Let's be honest: there are some good brands out there but they won't be able to keep going when there is a big correction.\" </p> <p>For the rest, the future looks less bright. One of the internet's most entertaining sites is <a href=\"http://www.itulip.com\" target=\"_NEW\">iTulip.com</a>, which brilliantly lampoons the whole high-tech bubble. \"Now you, too, can enjoy the thrill of owning an uneconomical internet company's stock certificate without fear of losing all your money,\" it says. \"Buy an iTulip.com Stock Certificate. Not only does iTulip.com not have any assets, revenues or profits, it doesn't even exist. Of course, some internet companies won't exist either after the internet stock speculative mania ends.\" </p> <p>At the moment, iTulip.com is plain funny. Before long, it could seem less amusing. </p> <p><strong>Bubble trouble: the tell-tale signs</strong></p> <p>* It's spend spend spend, as the lucky winners offload their gains. Champagne and cocaine fuelled the City in the 80s; today the traders blow their bonuses at lap dancing bars.

Everybody, it seems, wants a piece of a company that at the 11th hour can get you a flight to Spain or two tickets for the theatre. So much so that by tomorrow night Lastminute.com will be worth - on paper at least - as much as Manchester United, the world's richest football club. The dizzying price tag attached to a company that has been in business for all of 19 months seems a perfect symbol for the giddy mood of affluence that has gripped much of Britain since the words dot com became synonymous with easy money. With a pressure cooker stockmarket fuelling a frenzy of spending, the signs of an 80s-style boom are all around: soaring house prices, roaring sales of the most preposterous luxury goods, and the surest indicator of all, figures for the consumption of champagne that suggest some people are confusing it with sparkling water. But as punters sit and dream of the untold riches that Lastminute.com will bring them, they would do well to ponder four little words - the four most dangerous words in finance. This time it's different. Of course, speculators caught up in the frenzy are not doing any pondering at all. They're sticking to the dreaming. We've had stock market bubbles before, so their argument goes, but they were based on uncontrollable greed and hysteria. This time it's different. We've had stock market bubbles before, but back then there was no Alan Greenspan, the head of America's central bank, to steer us to safety. This time it's different. We've had stock market bubbles before, but that was when companies were run by charlatans and deadbeats rather than dynamic, young entrepreneurs. This time it's different. But what if it isn't? What if this bubble - this wild speculation in companies unheard of six months ago - is about to go the way of all the others, from tulip mania in 17th-century Holland to the Japanese stock market in the late 80s - and end in a spectacular crash? If - or rather when - it happens, it will happen suddenly. And the impact will be savage.

With 95% of votes counted, his Popular party was expected to obtain 183 seats in the 350-seat parliament while the main Socialist opposition dropped to 125, their worst showing since the early 1980s. Conceding defeat, the Socialist leader, Joaquin Almunia, announced his resignation. \"We have not been able to convince Spaniards with our project for the future; we have not been able to connect with their hopes and aspirations,\" he said. The results were a resounding endorsement for Mr Aznar's softly-softly approach to economic reform that has led to high growth and a job creation rate three times that of any other European country. The prime minister has also dispelled doubts that his party was a reincarnation of the old, autocratic right rather than a modernising centralist force. It is the first time that the conservative party has obtained a majority since Spain became a democracy following the death of the fascist dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975. Mr Almunia's attempts to rally the left through an electoral alliance with the Communist-led United Left appeared to have failed miserably. \"We have not been able to motivate leftwing voters, even though they are the majority in society,\" he said. \"That project remains for the future.\" Mr Almunia's claim that the government had practised \"crony capitalism\", enriching a few personal friends of the prime minister at the expense of the population as a whole, fell on deaf ears.

      "body": "<p>The unsettling thing about new media is that there is always, well, something new. It's not just a set of content and services that will steadily mature and be absorbed into the established order. It is always changing, always being enlarged, always coming up with new challenges. That is also the satisfying thing about it, of course. The latest challenge for the news media is mobile internet.</p> <p> Just when the newspapers, agencies and broadcasters were getting used to the internet, along comes internet-on-the-move. The downside from the media's point of view is yet another set of protocols, delivery mechanisms, interfaces and business models to be understood and developed. The upside is that it could make the economics of the whole industry upwardly mobile.</p> <p> And the glint of riches-to-come is leading media companies into the middle of the seething activity that characterises the entire mobile phone industry. Phone networks, makers of handsets, PDAs (personal digital assistants) and pagers, software and hardware companies and the content providers are all jostling for the lead positions in a business that will certainly be worth billions of pounds within three years.</p> <p> They are forming a bewildering array of defensive and aggressive alliances to try to ensure their particular interests prevail. There are announcements from major companies every week. So far this year we have heard of mobile internet plans from AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo, Oracle, Vodafone, Orange, The Woolwich, BBC, ITN and many others.</p> <p> \"Everybody is sleeping with everyone else, everyone is hedging their bets and the market will decide what people want and which partnerships work ultimately,\" says Jane Zweig of Herschel Shosteck Associates, a wireless consultancy in Washington DC.</p> <p> Putting the internet on to mobile phones, pagers and PDAs is not exactly new. It's been possible, in a modest way, for some time now. But the take-up has largely been confined to techies, nerds and enthusiasts. That is about to change. In the US, for example, the current total of 1.7m mobile internet users is expected to rise to 24m within three years. Although there is no evidence that the public is demanding mobile internet access, the supply-side is convinced the time is right to turn this into a massive new business.</p> <p> Why? Because the present generation of cell phones can already provide enough data-handling capability to give some web access, as well as email, banking and ticket reservations. All these things are available in Japan on the NTT \"I-mode\" service launched almost exactly a year ago. The public reaction has been hugely favourable and more than three million people now use the service. Even allowing for cultural differences, it is assumed that much of this success could be repeated in the west.</p> <p> The next two generations of mobile phone technology, known as 2.5 and 3G, will greatly improve the ability of the handheld devices to deliver more varied data content, eventually including video, to much bigger, clearer screens on the handset. 2.5 should start to appear in Europe next year and 3G, which should work anywhere in the world, by 2003.</p> <p> So the news that is now created for personal computers on desktops - or something like it - will become available on your mobile phone wherever you are in the world. Within three years you will be able to use your phone to read headlines, listen to audio, watch news video and interrogate the news companies' content databases to get tailored information and search the archive.</p> <p> But how do we get there? For the news media, the challenges are technical, editorial and financial.</p> <p> The first set of news content to make it to the mass market on mobile phones will be delivered by Wap (wireless application protocol). This is likely to be an interim technology since it is mostly intended to overcome the constraints in data-handling on the present generation of telephones. But then, all technology can be regarded as interim nowadays and Wap probably has a good two years of dominance ahead of it.</p> <p> So, news content has to be put into the right form for Wap. Then it has to be made to \"look right\" on the handset. Wap screens are larger than the displays on most people's current mobiles, but they still show only a small number of words. There might be people who want to read a 500-word article (the average length of a BBC News Online story) this way, but 60-80 words is much easier because it involves only a small amount of \"scrolling\".</p> <p> This happens to be the length of stories created for teletext services, so these can easily be re-purposed for mobile phones. The BBC is currently sending Ceefax stories, in Wap format, to Vodafone as the basis of an experimental news service. These meet the key criteria of form, timeliness and comprehensiveness. Any news organisation wanting to offer competitive mobile services will need to meet these two needs.</p> <p> Timeliness, in particular, would seem even more relevant on mobile platforms than it is on desktop PCs. People on the move have less time to read, it will almost certainly cost more to do it, and there will be much less screen space to look at. This seems to many in the business to lend itself more to up-to-the-minute or \"breaking\" news than to longer-form, considered coverage.</p> <p> And that in turn reinforces the challenge to newspapers. \"Breaking\" news is not their strong point and to succeed in the mobile internet space they will probably need to continue further down the route that the Guardian and others have taken, of expanding their web publishing activities beyond the content that is prepared for the printed page.</p> <p> Wireless industry analyst Andrew Seybold, author of the respected Andrew Seybold's Outlook, says general web surfing is unlikely to be satisfying for a mobile-phone user. \"I believe that many people's first experience with the internet will be wireless and that might be an OK thing. But coming from the world of the 17-inch monitor to the wireless web is going to be painful - unless folks understand that wireless is about a surgical strike into the internet for specific information, and not about surfing.\"</p> <p> But when phone display screens get bigger, and as audio and video are progressively added to the service, the offering will become much richer and more complex. Making the coverage coherent in the mobile interface will be a significant task in the months ahead for all news companies. Re-versioning existing content might continue to work, and that would suit the marketing and finance people in the news business who love the efficiency suggested by phrases such as \"write once, use often\".</p> <p> The rewards for getting it right could be fundamental to the future of web news. Like almost every other type of web business, commercial news sites have struggled to make money. Mobile internet could be their salvation.</p> <p> There are several reasons for this, but the main one is the simple fact that access from mobile devices is certain to make the internet market bigger. CNN Interactive is already a good example of this factor at work.</p> <p> Surprisingly, for a big web company, CNN is fairly candid about its financial position. Last year, for the first time since its launch, the CNN web arm covered its operating costs. The figures are not publicly available, but CNN has a staff of 450 and a big technical infrastructure, so the revenues must have been considerable. By comparison, the BBC site, with a third of the staff and a much smaller infrastructure, costs about \u00a38m a year.</p> <p> One of the ways CNN \"hit the black\" was by selling on their content to mobile phone networks.

      "bodyText": "The unsettling thing about new media is that there is always, well, something new. It's not just a set of content and services that will steadily mature and be absorbed into the established order. It is always changing, always being enlarged, always coming up with new challenges. That is also the satisfying thing about it, of course. The latest challenge for the news media is mobile internet. Just when the newspapers, agencies and broadcasters were getting used to the internet, along comes internet-on-the-move. The downside from the media's point of view is yet another set of protocols, delivery mechanisms, interfaces and business models to be understood and developed. The upside is that it could make the economics of the whole industry upwardly mobile. And the glint of riches-to-come is leading media companies into the middle of the seething activity that characterises the entire mobile phone industry. Phone networks, makers of handsets, PDAs (personal digital assistants) and pagers, software and hardware companies and the content providers are all jostling for the lead positions in a business that will certainly be worth billions of pounds within three years. They are forming a bewildering array of defensive and aggressive alliances to try to ensure their particular interests prevail. There are announcements from major companies every week. So far this year we have heard of mobile internet plans from AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo, Oracle, Vodafone, Orange, The Woolwich, BBC, ITN and many others. \"Everybody is sleeping with everyone else, everyone is hedging their bets and the market will decide what people want and which partnerships work ultimately,\" says Jane Zweig of Herschel Shosteck Associates, a wireless consultancy in Washington DC. Putting the internet on to mobile phones, pagers and PDAs is not exactly new. It's been possible, in a modest way, for some time now. But the take-up has largely been confined to techies, nerds and enthusiasts. That is about to change. In the US, for example, the current total of 1.7m mobile internet users is expected to rise to 24m within three years. Although there is no evidence that the public is demanding mobile internet access, the supply-side is convinced the time is right to turn this into a massive new business. Why? Because the present generation of cell phones can already provide enough data-handling capability to give some web access, as well as email, banking and ticket reservations. All these things are available in Japan on the NTT \"I-mode\" service launched almost exactly a year ago. The public reaction has been hugely favourable and more than three million people now use the service. Even allowing for cultural differences, it is assumed that much of this success could be repeated in the west. The next two generations of mobile phone technology, known as 2.5 and 3G, will greatly improve the ability of the handheld devices to deliver more varied data content, eventually including video, to much bigger, clearer screens on the handset. 2.5 should start to appear in Europe next year and 3G, which should work anywhere in the world, by 2003. So the news that is now created for personal computers on desktops - or something like it - will become available on your mobile phone wherever you are in the world. Within three years you will be able to use your phone to read headlines, listen to audio, watch news video and interrogate the news companies' content databases to get tailored information and search the archive. But how do we get there? For the news media, the challenges are technical, editorial and financial. The first set of news content to make it to the mass market on mobile phones will be delivered by Wap (wireless application protocol). This is likely to be an interim technology since it is mostly intended to overcome the constraints in data-handling on the present generation of telephones. But then, all technology can be regarded as interim nowadays and Wap probably has a good two years of dominance ahead of it. So, news content has to be put into the right form for Wap. Then it has to be made to \"look right\" on the handset. Wap screens are larger than the displays on most people's current mobiles, but they still show only a small number of words. There might be people who want to read a 500-word article (the average length of a BBC News Online story) this way, but 60-80 words is much easier because it involves only a small amount of \"scrolling\". This happens to be the length of stories created for teletext services, so these can easily be re-purposed for mobile phones. The BBC is currently sending Ceefax stories, in Wap format, to Vodafone as the basis of an experimental news service. These meet the key criteria of form, timeliness and comprehensiveness. Any news organisation wanting to offer competitive mobile services will need to meet these two needs. Timeliness, in particular, would seem even more relevant on mobile platforms than it is on desktop PCs. People on the move have less time to read, it will almost certainly cost more to do it, and there will be much less screen space to look at. This seems to many in the business to lend itself more to up-to-the-minute or \"breaking\" news than to longer-form, considered coverage. And that in turn reinforces the challenge to newspapers. \"Breaking\" news is not their strong point and to succeed in the mobile internet space they will probably need to continue further down the route that the Guardian and others have taken, of expanding their web publishing activities beyond the content that is prepared for the printed page. Wireless industry analyst Andrew Seybold, author of the respected Andrew Seybold's Outlook, says general web surfing is unlikely to be satisfying for a mobile-phone user. \"I believe that many people's first experience with the internet will be wireless and that might be an OK thing. But coming from the world of the 17-inch monitor to the wireless web is going to be painful - unless folks understand that wireless is about a surgical strike into the internet for specific information, and not about surfing.\" But when phone display screens get bigger, and as audio and video are progressively added to the service, the offering will become much richer and more complex. Making the coverage coherent in the mobile interface will be a significant task in the months ahead for all news companies. Re-versioning existing content might continue to work, and that would suit the marketing and finance people in the news business who love the efficiency suggested by phrases such as \"write once, use often\". The rewards for getting it right could be fundamental to the future of web news. Like almost every other type of web business, commercial news sites have struggled to make money. Mobile internet could be their salvation. There are several reasons for this, but the main one is the simple fact that access from mobile devices is certain to make the internet market bigger. CNN Interactive is already a good example of this factor at work. Surprisingly, for a big web company, CNN is fairly candid about its financial position. Last year, for the first time since its launch, the CNN web arm covered its operating costs. The figures are not publicly available, but CNN has a staff of 450 and a big technical infrastructure, so the revenues must have been considerable. By comparison, the BBC site, with a third of the staff and a much smaller infrastructure, costs about \u00a38m a year. One of the ways CNN \"hit the black\" was by selling on their content to mobile phone networks. Scott Woelfel, editor-in-chief, says: \"It was only one contributory factor but mobile services give you the ability to leverage content over a wider range of distribution, thereby increasing the margin.\" What type of content is likely to \"sell\" over mobile internet? CNN has found that general content like news summaries is popular, but so is the more granular information that can be highly personalised, for example sports results and stock prices. This coincides with the view of Psion, the UK company whose future is bound up in the success of mobile internet access. Psion is not only a leading manufacturer of PDAs but also has a big stake in Epoc, the most popular operating system for mobiles. \"Our aim is to put the internet in your pocket,\" says David Levin, Psion chief executive. \"Three things are converging [through the next generations of mobile phones]: the internet, broadband services and computing power, and that will create a rich environment in which to innovate services for personal and corporate users. \"We think three factors are crucial to the future of mobile services: location of the user, so that services that are available there can be accessed; time sensitivity - people want things right now; and personalised information - the stuff that matters to me.\" Although there is no shortage of \"vision\" within the industry, it is an exceptionally difficult environment in which to work because of the scramble for \"first-mover-advantage\". \"There are two words, wireless and internet, that make rich and smart people very dumb,\" says Seybold. \"There are some real good deals being put together and some real good stuff happening here . . . but we have to go through all the hype and bullshit before we get there.\" And Bob Egan, wireless specialist with the Gartner Research Group, warns media and other companies not to expect too much too soon: \"The wireless web access market for cell phones is likely to die a thousand deaths before any internet portal or m[mobile]-commerce company makes money in this market.

Writing to his superior in Ulster, Lieutenant General Harry Tuzo, Ford observed that the Bogside's stone-throwing rioters -dubbed \"Derry Young Hooligans\" (DYH) by the army-were no longer deterred by conventional crowd control weapons such as rubber bullets and CS gas.</p> <p>An alternative had to be found because the regular rioting, which included petrol bombs and nail bombs, prevented the army from patrolling the \"no go\" area of the Bogside and the Creggan and often formed a cover for IRA snipers, turning foot patrols into high-risk operations.</p> <p><b> Brutal conclusion</b><br></p> <p>At the time of Ford's memo - three weeks before Bloody Sunday - the army was under pressure from Stormont and Westminster to restore law in the Catholic enclaves. Ford had to weigh up whether to sit things out in the hope that the rioting would taper off, invade the enclaves with his limited resources, or develop more effective methods of deterring the hooligans.</p> <p>His brutally frank conclusion was that: \"The minimum force necessary to achieve a restoration of law and order is to shoot selected ring leaders among the DYH, after clear warnings have been given.\" Ford considered that soldiers would be justified in opening fire with their 7.62mm self-loading rifles (SLRs), then the army's main infantry weapon, but he was understandably worried about the risk of collateral casualties.</p> <p>The high-velocity rounds could penetrate an iron railway line at short range and had been known to travel for three miles; a bullet could tear straight through one person's body and retain sufficient force to kill another. Ford proposed adapting some SLRs to take a smaller .22in high-velocity round \" to enable ring leaders to be engaged with less lethal ammunition\".</p> <p>In early January, Ford sent 30 of the modified rifles to Derry for training purposes, though he emphasised they would not be deployed without authorisation. The question facing Saville is whether any of the adapted rifles were ever used - particularly on Bloody Sunday.</p> <p>After Saville had formally opened the new inquiry in 1998, he asked the MoD to provide all the SLRs fired by the paratroopers. For the 1972 official inquiry into the killings - carried out by Lord Widgery, then lord chief justice - 29 rifles were produced but they were no longer in service.</p> <p>In 1986, the SLR was replaced by a lighter rifle, the SA80, which fired a smaller 5.56 mm round (coincidentally, the equivalent of a .22in). The SLRs were progressively scrapped. The MoD reported to Saville that 14 of the 29 rifles had been destroyed and another 10 sold to private companies.</p> <p>The inquiry received an assurance that the remaining five rifles would be preserved as evidence, but last January, in defiance of an internal MoD order, two more of the SLRs were destroyed, leaving only three. Saville was livid. In a written answer in the Commons, Geoff Hoon expressed \"deep regret\" and ordered an investigation by the head of the MoD police, with officers from the West Mercia constabulary also involved. Saville was invited to nominate an observer.</p> <p>But what could the paratroopers' rifles have told the new inquiry after so many years?</p> <p>Forensic evidence produced for the Widgery tribunal established that two bullets, said to be 7.62mm rounds, lodged in two of the dead were matched to rifles of paratroopers identified as Soldier F, a lance corporal, and Soldier G, a private. Soldier F shot 17-year-old Michael Kelly and Soldier G shot Gerald Donaghy, also 17, both in the stomach. They bled to death.</p> <p>According to army statements for Widgery, all the ammunition issued that day was either 7.62mm rounds for the SLRs, or 9mm for Browning pistols, mostly carried by the officers. And post-mortem examinations established that all but one of the entry wounds on the 13 dead measured between 6-8mm, corresponding to the 7.62 round. But the bullet that killed Kevin McElhinney, 17, who was shot from behind, left a significantly smaller entry wound that measured only 3mm. It entered his left buttock and sliced through his bladder, colon and severed an artery. He died almost immediately.</p> <p>Could the pathologists have made a mistake or was the bullet of a different calibre - a .22in perhaps?</p> <p>The Widgery tribunal heard that the soldier who shot McElhinney could not be identified; it might have been either Seargent K, or Privates L or M. Soldier L's evidence did not mention what type of rifle he had; Soldier M said he had a 7.62mm SLR; Sgt K had a sniper's rifle, an SLR with a telescopic sight, but he did not mention the calibre.</p> <p>Forensic pathologists acknowledge that the size of entry wounds does not tell the whole story. The same bullet can produce a hole of different dimensions depending on how it flies through the air, whether it is deflected on the way to its target (a ricochet), and the type of body tissue it enters.</p> <p><b> Soft target</b><br></p> <p>When a rifle bullet leaves the barrel it wobbles initially, then stabilises and spins like a top and, in theory, travels nose first. But in practice bullets always yaw slightly and never hit the target nose on. The greater the yaw the larger the surface area of the bullet presented to the target, and, therefore, the larger the entry wound. If a bullet hits something on its way to the target, it might start to tumble, causing an even larger entry wound. For example, the bullet, said to have been a 7.62 round, that killed Gerald Donaghy, 17, made a gaping 3 x 2cm hole and Saville's experts have concluded that it was a ricochet.</p> <p>If the bullet strikes a soft target, such as the tissue of a buttock, as in McElhinney's case, the entry may appear smaller because the tissue can close round the wound. The only way to check is from photographs taken of the corpse but Saville's experts say too few were taken and many were taken at too great a distance.</p> <p>At the time of the Widgery inquiry, General Ford's memo about the .22in rifles was still secret, so the question of whether any of the soldiers had rifles of a different calibre was never asked. Now, with only three of the original rifles now available, it may never be answered.</p> <p>The missing rifles could also make it much harder for Saville to unravel the mystery of what happened to the 19 rounds fired by the paratrooper identified as Soldier H. He said he was shooting at a gunman behind a bathroom window in a flat in the Bogside, but it was established that this was not the case. So what were his 19 bullets really aimed at if, indeed, it was he who fired them? Saville may wish to consider whether Soldier H was the fall guy for comrades who had fired more rounds than they wanted to admit.</p> <p>Another way of matching a bullet to a rifle is by its casing. Each time a bullet is fired the ejected casing has a mark made by the hammer in the firing mechanism. The spoils of war among citizens in the Bogside included spent bullet casings.</p> <p>If all, or even most of the rifles, used by the paratroopers were still available, cas ings collected by civilians on Bloody Sunday - and some spent bullets were handed in to Widgery - could have been tested to see if they matched.</p> <p>Finally, with only three of the rifles left, Saville may be handicapped in finding out the distance from which the paratroopers fired.

Many Catholics - let alone those outside the church - naturally feel that the apology has been issued scandalously late. But it also comes hard on the heels of a Vatican declaration that Pius IX, a notoriously anti-Semitic 19th century pontiff, is to be beatified on September 3. The move will place him in line to be declared a saint soon afterwards; but as Professor Owen Chadwick, Britain's foremost church historian, comments: \"Pius IX's [record] verges on the criminal.\"</p> <p>Pius IX (born Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti), a symbol of unbending resistance to the modern world, reigned for a record period between 1846 and 1878. He is chiefly remembered for proclamations on the immaculate conception (1854) and infallibility (1870), and for his condemnation in The Syllabus of Errors of anyone who held that \"the Roman Pontiff can and should reconcile himself with progress, liberalism and modern civilisation\".</p> <p>His anti-Semitism, though not untypical of the period, caused dismay even to many contemporary Catholics. As the world has now been reminded, in 1858 the papal police in Bologna entered the home of a Jewish couple and abducted their six-year-old son. Their pretext was that the boy, Edgardo Mortara, had been baptised while dan gerously ill by a housemaid several years earlier. Edgardo was detained and subsequently adopted by Pope Pius, who refused to give him back to his distraught parents unless they converted to Catholicism.</p> <p>Even when seen in the most sympathetic light (Pius clearly believed he was saving Edgardo from damnation), this record is hardly synonymous with sainthood. Why should the present Pope - an intellectual who says he welcomes dialogue between theology and other disciplines, and a staunch advocate of human rights - now be giving his blessing to a figure as ignominious as Mastai-Ferretti?</p> <p>The decision is a mark of the deep contrasts and contradictions in John Paul's character. Though a lifelong critic of the right and leftwing dictatorships he lived under before his election, this Pope has been happy to accept or extend an authoritarian style of church government. His approach to saint-making - avid, controversial and unchallengeable - is as clear a mark of his conservative agenda as the Vatican's regular silencing of independently minded theologians has been.</p> <p>Normally, a prime requirement of beatification is that a cult should have arisen around the candidate in question. Though an icon of resistance to the Risorgimento during his lifetime, Pius has signally failed to satisfy this test. He will be beatified on the same day as Pope John XXIII, a figure of genuine stature who opened the Catholic church to the modern world through the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65.</p> <p>The joint ceremony will form a coded warning that liberalism can only operate within strict limits, and take place soon before an equally contentious service to beatify several hundred \"martyrs\" from the Spanish civil war.</p> <p>\"The irony of infallibility,\" says Owen Chadwick, \"is that it places limitations on popes because they can't contradict their predecessors.\" (The doctrine was first invoked during the Renaissance by Franciscans who told the then pope that he could not contradict an earlier pontiff's declaration that Christ had lived in poverty.) A Catholic historian who wishes not to be named goes further. \"Not being able to condemn a predecessor is one thing. But affirming a former pope so explicitly is quite another. John Paul II's action is a disgraceful abuse of his authority.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Rupert Shortt was formerly assistant editor of the Tablet</p>",

As the world has now been reminded, in 1858 the papal police in Bologna entered the home of a Jewish couple and abducted their six-year-old son. Their pretext was that the boy, Edgardo Mortara, had been baptised while dan gerously ill by a housemaid several years earlier. Edgardo was detained and subsequently adopted by Pope Pius, who refused to give him back to his distraught parents unless they converted to Catholicism. Even when seen in the most sympathetic light (Pius clearly believed he was saving Edgardo from damnation), this record is hardly synonymous with sainthood. Why should the present Pope - an intellectual who says he welcomes dialogue between theology and other disciplines, and a staunch advocate of human rights - now be giving his blessing to a figure as ignominious as Mastai-Ferretti? The decision is a mark of the deep contrasts and contradictions in John Paul's character. Though a lifelong critic of the right and leftwing dictatorships he lived under before his election, this Pope has been happy to accept or extend an authoritarian style of church government. His approach to saint-making - avid, controversial and unchallengeable - is as clear a mark of his conservative agenda as the Vatican's regular silencing of independently minded theologians has been. Normally, a prime requirement of beatification is that a cult should have arisen around the candidate in question. Though an icon of resistance to the Risorgimento during his lifetime, Pius has signally failed to satisfy this test. He will be beatified on the same day as Pope John XXIII, a figure of genuine stature who opened the Catholic church to the modern world through the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65. The joint ceremony will form a coded warning that liberalism can only operate within strict limits, and take place soon before an equally contentious service to beatify several hundred \"martyrs\" from the Spanish civil war. \"The irony of infallibility,\" says Owen Chadwick, \"is that it places limitations on popes because they can't contradict their predecessors.\" (The doctrine was first invoked during the Renaissance by Franciscans who told the then pope that he could not contradict an earlier pontiff's declaration that Christ had lived in poverty.) A Catholic historian who wishes not to be named goes further. \"Not being able to condemn a predecessor is one thing. But affirming a former pope so explicitly is quite another. John Paul II's action is a disgraceful abuse of his authority.\" \u0095 Rupert Shortt was formerly assistant editor of the Tablet",

Redundant in an age of large private sector financial flows. The United Nations? Inefficient, little more than an expensive talking shop. </p> <p>Even more worrying is that the attacks on the global institutions have come from left and right. The right has always been suspicious of any form of governance and sees the Bank and the Fund as relics of a discredited age interventionism. For a variety of reasons - debt, structural adjustment, dams, bananas - a section of the left has lost its faith in multilateralism. </p> <p>It is not difficult to see why these views are held. In the immediate post-war period, the Fund was the custodian of the fixed exchange rate system set up at Bretton Woods and helped countries through short-term balance of payments crises. But since the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the early 1970s the Fund has had its fingers in every economic pie, with little success. </p> <p>Even so, it would be mistake to give up on multilaterism. It is tempting to believe that a world without a WTO or an IMF would return to a state of pre-globalisation nirvana, but it would not. All that would happen is that there would a state of global anarchy in which the strongest would use their muscle to extract concessions from the weak. The result of dismantling the Fund, for example, would not be that poor countries cease to have inappropriate policies foisted on them: it would simply mean the inappropriate policies would be imposed by the rich countries of the G7 rather than by the IMF. </p> <p>So let's not kid ourselves. A retreat from multilaterism would not be a victory for the forces of progressivism, it would leave the field open for the forces of conservatism. The solution is to reshape the way multilateral institutions work and create new ones to address issues such as environmental protection. </p> <p>Although they are often caricatured as being unaccountable, the multilateral organisations reflect the policies of the countries that make up their membership. Should the IMF wish to promulgate expansionary macro-economic policies, with domestic autonomy protected by controls on capital, there is no reason why it could not do so, provided that is what its main shareholders want. </p> <p>Indeed, this was what was enshrined in the first article of agreement of the Fund in 1944. Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, the US negotiator, faced down protests from Wall Street and committed the IMF to \"the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income, and the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy\". Nothing there about deflation, budget cuts, structural adjustment, privatisation and the rest of the neo-liberal catechism. That came later, when the west turned its back on the economic policies of the golden age. While it is tempting for countries to blame the Fund for unpopular and painful policies, the truth is that countries - especially the G7 countries - dictate to the Fund rather than the other way round. </p> <p>Now is a good time to attempt progressive reform of the Fund. The financial instability of recent years has dented faith in the main tenets of neo-liberalism and created space to redefine the role of the multilateral institutions. If the left does not engage in this debate it will leave the field open to those on the right who would prefer minimal global governance or none at all. </p> <p>A contribution to the debate came last week from the Meltzer report on future US policy towards the Fund, the Bank, the regional development banks, the Bank for International Settlements and the WTO. One of the main recommendations - that the Fund and the Bank should write off their claims against all highly indebted poor countries - was welcome; the other, that the Fund restrict its lending to the provision of short-term liquidity and withdraw from the arena of poverty reduction altogether, was far more questionable. </p> <p>Certainly, the Fund's track record in developing policies that will combine macro-economic success with poverty reduction has been abysmal. It has been arrogant and wrong. But it would be naive to assume that the absence of the Fund would mean that poor countries would be left to their own devices, because they assuredly would not. The same policies would be imposed by the G7 and, more particularly, the US treasury. Those on the left who want to see the demise of the Fund have to ask themselves whether that would be a better or worse outcome. </p> <p>Let us start from a different perspective: that the Fund is intrinsically a good thing. Let us also assume that it has good and honourable people working for it whose intention is to improve global welfare. Can it be harnessed to make the world a better place? </p> <p>The answer is yes. First, there is a question of democratic control. As the shenanigans over who is to succeed Michel Camdessus as managing director have shown, the IMF is essentially a plaything of the G7, which with only 14% of global population controls 57% of the vote. It is much less democratic than the WTO, where all carry equal weight. Such a system is impossible in the Fund, because members expect to call the tune. But restricting the vote of any country to 10% while increasing the voting power of developing countries would be a step in the right direction. As Oxfam says: \"It is unacceptable that people in Africa, whose lives are arguably most affected by IMF programmes, account for only 2% of voting rights. It is outrageous that loan conditions are used to promote policy reforms in poor countries - such as agricultural market liberalisation, rapid trade liberalisation, financial market deregulation - which would be rejected in G7 countries.\" </p> <p><strong> Lender of last resort</strong></p> <p>Second, the IMF and other multilateral institutions need to remember that one of the principles upon which they were established was that the burden of adjustment in times of difficulty should fall on creditors as well as debtors. In the case of the Fund, countries running balance of payments surpluses should operate expansionary demand policies to help those in deficit. This principle has been turned on its head: the presumption is that deficit countries must resolve their own problems by deflating. </p> <p>Third, the Fund should operate as a proper lender of last resort, but this is something that it cannot do unless it is also prepared to tame global capital markets. Naturally, this is something that the US, the Fund's biggest shareholder, is not prepared to countenance, but the reality is that a lender of last resort can only work if there are effective national and global policies to restrict volatility. The object of the Fund should be to foster liquidity and output, not create Wall Street buying opportunities. </p> <p>It would be wrong to say this will be easy. It won't be, given that even at a time when so-called social democratic governments are in power across most of the west, the G7 seems unable to state the obvious: that the neo-liberal emperor has no clothes. What will change that? As Harold Macmillan once said: \"Events, dear boy, events.\" </p> <p><em>larry.elliott@theguardian.com</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>A Scottish morning dawns in Troon, a blustery South Ayrshire town of old folk and tea shops, and Malcolm Rifkind, ex-conservative cabinet minister and unseated MP, takes to the streets with a plum in his mouth, leaflets in his hand and a spring in his step.</p> <p>In his Barbour jacket and tartan tie he strides around, canvassing for the local candidate in this Thursday's byelection for the Scottish parliament, with the confidence of man apparently oblivious to the oblivion which has been inflicted on his own party in recent elections north of the border. \"We haven't seen a favourable reaction like this for a Tory candidate for some years,\" he says. \"You can sense that the mood is changing.\"</p> <p>The voters look set to oust Labour and return a Tory to the Scottish parliament. According to the polls their lead is narrow but consistent - although a huge number remain undecided. A victory would make John Scott, a local farmer, the first Conservative MSP to be elected on the first-past-the-post basis. The prospect has put Tories in jubilant mood, with supporters pouring in from all over Scotland.</p> <p>The ramifications of a Tory victory here go beyond the Tweed to the nation at large. Its importance is reflected in the big guns that have been sent to the area from Westminster. The Conservative leader, William Hague, arrives today. The cabinet enforcer, Mo Mowlam, was here on Thursday. It is also illustrated by a high-level snub last week from the prime minister. Despite a visit to Scotland Tony Blair declined to come to the constituency, claiming pressure of work. Many here accuse him of running scared of association with almost certain defeat.</p> <p>It is easy to grasp the significance of such a defeat for Conservatives. Most commentators have either written them out of the current political narrative as an irrelevance or written them in as a joke. When shadow spokesmen and women are wheeled in front of the cameras one presumes that (with the possible exception of Anne Widdecombe) they have been invited either out of sympathy or in a desperate search for balance - not because they might have something to contribute, however nefarious, to any particular debate. Hague is regarded as a man holding the fort and clearing up the mess until a grown-up steps in - not as the possible leader of the next government.</p> <p>Victory in Ayr, Tories hope, followed by gains in council elections in May, might signal the green shoots of a general recovery. \"I very much hope that this election is seen as the turning point in Tory party fortunes throughout the country,\" says Scott. \"It will show that we have learnt our lesson from the last election and that the voters can trust us.\"</p> <p>If he wins this, many far more extravagant claims will be made by the right which should be treated with extreme caution rather than dismissive ridicule. Defeat in Ayr will not send Millbank into a tailspin. This is not like Dudley West, which went from a 5,789 Conservative majority to a 20,694 Labour win in 1994, presaging the 1997 landslide. Labour won by only 25 votes in Ayr last year. If the Conservatives cannot overturn that slender margin almost three years into Labour's term then there is little hope for them.</p> <p>But the result should serve as a timely reminder that, unlike Monty Python's infamous parrot, the Tory party is not dead, but merely sleeping.</p> <p>The shock Conservative victory in last year's Euro elections shows just what a mistake it is to write them off. The sense of drift, introspection and lack of unity they display may evoke Labour during the early 80s.

      "bodyText": "A Scottish morning dawns in Troon, a blustery South Ayrshire town of old folk and tea shops, and Malcolm Rifkind, ex-conservative cabinet minister and unseated MP, takes to the streets with a plum in his mouth, leaflets in his hand and a spring in his step. In his Barbour jacket and tartan tie he strides around, canvassing for the local candidate in this Thursday's byelection for the Scottish parliament, with the confidence of man apparently oblivious to the oblivion which has been inflicted on his own party in recent elections north of the border. \"We haven't seen a favourable reaction like this for a Tory candidate for some years,\" he says. \"You can sense that the mood is changing.\" The voters look set to oust Labour and return a Tory to the Scottish parliament. According to the polls their lead is narrow but consistent - although a huge number remain undecided. A victory would make John Scott, a local farmer, the first Conservative MSP to be elected on the first-past-the-post basis. The prospect has put Tories in jubilant mood, with supporters pouring in from all over Scotland. The ramifications of a Tory victory here go beyond the Tweed to the nation at large. Its importance is reflected in the big guns that have been sent to the area from Westminster. The Conservative leader, William Hague, arrives today. The cabinet enforcer, Mo Mowlam, was here on Thursday. It is also illustrated by a high-level snub last week from the prime minister. Despite a visit to Scotland Tony Blair declined to come to the constituency, claiming pressure of work. Many here accuse him of running scared of association with almost certain defeat. It is easy to grasp the significance of such a defeat for Conservatives. Most commentators have either written them out of the current political narrative as an irrelevance or written them in as a joke. When shadow spokesmen and women are wheeled in front of the cameras one presumes that (with the possible exception of Anne Widdecombe) they have been invited either out of sympathy or in a desperate search for balance - not because they might have something to contribute, however nefarious, to any particular debate. Hague is regarded as a man holding the fort and clearing up the mess until a grown-up steps in - not as the possible leader of the next government. Victory in Ayr, Tories hope, followed by gains in council elections in May, might signal the green shoots of a general recovery. \"I very much hope that this election is seen as the turning point in Tory party fortunes throughout the country,\" says Scott. \"It will show that we have learnt our lesson from the last election and that the voters can trust us.\" If he wins this, many far more extravagant claims will be made by the right which should be treated with extreme caution rather than dismissive ridicule. Defeat in Ayr will not send Millbank into a tailspin. This is not like Dudley West, which went from a 5,789 Conservative majority to a 20,694 Labour win in 1994, presaging the 1997 landslide. Labour won by only 25 votes in Ayr last year. If the Conservatives cannot overturn that slender margin almost three years into Labour's term then there is little hope for them. But the result should serve as a timely reminder that, unlike Monty Python's infamous parrot, the Tory party is not dead, but merely sleeping. The shock Conservative victory in last year's Euro elections shows just what a mistake it is to write them off. The sense of drift, introspection and lack of unity they display may evoke Labour during the early 80s. But electorally their share of the popular vote in 1997 is almost identical to Labour's in 1987. And come the next election there will be many more slender margins out there for them to whittle away at - more than a third of Labour's majority comes from constituencies won by less than 5,000 votes; add to this almost half the Liberal Democrat seats which are held by the same margin and it becomes clear that in 18 months the Tories could be in a position to mount a credible opposition. Yet they do not seem ready for the role. There is more to opposition than arithmetic. They will owe a victory in Ayr only to disillusionment with the government both in Westminster and Holyrood. If Labour crash to third position behind the SNP, as one poll suggested they might, it will be because three-quarters of those those who currently don't know how to vote on Thursday voted Labour last time. Turning disaffected Labour supporters into active Tories will not be easy - especially so long as the economy is strong. But it might not be impossible. Many of those who backed Labour at the last election did so for the first time and, given the right incentive, could be attracted back without too much concern about loyalty. This is Blair's worst nightmare - the Tories galvanising their core support while Labour voters sit on their hands. Paradoxically, given that it was the issue which tore them apart before the last election, the most popular policy the Conservatives have is on Europe.

      "body": "<p>When Simon Walters, the Mail on Sunday's political editor, telephoned Alastair Campbell nine days ago he knew what to expect. He was about to tell the prime minister's formidable press secretary that his paper knew all about a supposedly secret book written by the Blair family's former nanny, Ros Mark. But this tape-recorded call, received by Campbell after he had watched his beloved Burnley lose a match, did not go as Walters, or his editor Peter Wright, anticipated.</p> <p>It was the beginning of a story that was still rumbling over the weekend, a row that was still producing many column inches in yesterday's Sunday papers. The case of the nanny, the Blairs and the MoS has raised a myriad of important issues concerning press ethics.</p> <p>Walters thought Campbell would be amazed when he revealed to him that Mark had written a book and would probably explode when he explained that the MoS was planning to write a story about it.</p> <p>Instead, Campbell was unsurprised. He had had a conversation hours earlier with Mark in which she had told him that she had been approached by the MoS. She told him she had written \"a manuscript\" which she had passed on to an agent, whom she had since dismissed. She didn't know what to do, she said. Mark assured Campbell that there was no question of her publishing anything without obtaining the full permission of the Blairs. It was, she explained, a sort of social history. The agent had told her he couldn't sell the manuscript because it was an affectionate portrait of the Blair household and not a kiss-and-tell story.</p> <p>Campbell suggested that Mark write to the paper to ensure that nothing in the least bit controversial might be published. She then sent Wright an email message asking what the paper intended to publish and asking whether it might be possible to delay any story for a couple of weeks until she had finished her teacher-training course.</p> <p>Believing he had taken sensible precautions, Campbell was relaxed throughout his call from Walters. He wanted to avoid any headline critical of Blair.</p> <p>On his side, Walters wanted to conceal the fact that the paper knew exactly what was in the manuscript. So the conversation was like a surreal bout of shadow boxing.</p> <p>My belief is that Walters was trying to provoke Campbell into launching some kind of legal action, or at least a fearsome threat of one, enabling the paper to publish a story headlined along the lines of \"Blair gags nanny\". Aware of this tactic, Campbell assumed an air of nonchalance, a reaction which probably upset Wright's plans. Walters asked Campbell if he had \"a problem\" with the paper saying that Mark was seeking a publisher for her book.</p> <p>Given the assurances from Mark, Campbell was noncommital. It was going to be a routine story, he thought, so he even told Walters: \"If you want a quote say 'Tony and Cherie think Ros Mark is a 100% good person. They would trust her not to say anything that would harm or embarrass the family'.\"</p> <p>That single conversation was to prove crucial to the storm that was to break hours later. It is possible, with hindsight, to see how important it was. For some reason, mainly due to Campbell's high regard for Mark, neither of the calls - from Mark and Walters - rang alarm bells. The woman had had an exemplary record while working for the Blairs, was loved by the children and had kept in regular touch with the family since leaving her job in August 1998.</p> <p>According to people close to the Blairs, she was capable, conscientious and clever. Whatever the problems and strains, she was \"a rock\", coping calmly whatever the crisis. Soon after Mark joined the household in January 1994, Cherie Blair realised her good fortune in having found her. Though sad when the nanny left, she understood: Mark wanted to put her intelligence and skills to better use by becoming a teacher.</p> <p>Aware of all this, Campbell's antennae were not tuned in. In an unusual example of naivety, he accepted that there was not a completed book.</p> <p>According to Mark, the MoS had virtually tricked their way into her house and she appears not to have informed Campbell of the extent of the \"manuscript\". He was left feeling it was an \"outline\" for a book and not the 451-page, 180,000-word document she had typed over the previous year. Mark had first been visited at her home in Galgate, near Lancaster, by the MoS's writer, Fiona Barton, on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>Barton wasn't invited in but Mark did confirm during a doorstep conversation that she had written a book. They parted - on friendly terms, according to the MoS, though not according to Mark - and Barton returned, with a photographer, the next day. Barton made two more visits on Saturday morning and this time she was allowed into the house, also meeting Mark's mother, Margaret, known as Mig. During the course of these visits, Mark talked much more fully about the book's content. She also posed happily for pictures and even handed over pictures of herself with the Blair family.</p> <p>Mark was later to claim that she posed reluctantly when told that pictures of her taken at a distance made her look \"tired\". Wouldn't she prefer to see herself looking groomed? Whether true or not, most journalists know of this ruse.</p> <p>During those talks, Barton came to believe that Mark did want the book published and was also hoping for a newspaper serialisation. Surely though, asked Barton, there was some kind of confidentiality agreement between her and the Blairs? Yes, replied Mark, there was. In fact, she had raised it with Cherie a couple of years into her tenure, but a friend had convinced her that it wasn't binding.</p> <p>At this point, the MoS's editor and lawyers knew they had to be careful. No paper has a better first-hand knowledge of the Blairs' desire to protect their children. The MoS was censured by the Press Complaints Commission last year for running a story about the schooling of Kathryn Blair, and no matter how much the adjudication rankled with Wright, he was unlikely to stray into a legal confrontation with the Blairs without taking great care. What tipped the balance was their interpretation of the Walters-Campbell call. Since Campbell knew they had been talking to the nanny and offered them a quote, it must be OK to go ahead.</p> <p>A splash was written with a prediction which soon turned out to be spot on: a \"sensational\" account by their nanny \"would spark a major controversy with the Blairs\". She had written it, she explained to the paper, because \"I had been part of a moment in history and I wanted to write about it for historical reasons\".</p> <p>The next mystery is how the paper came by Mark's manuscript in the first place. By her account, she handed a disk of her would-be book to an agent selected at random, Jonathan Harris, asking him to find a publisher.</p> <p>The MoS is coy about how it came to know of the book, claiming it came from \"sources in the publishing industry\". Harris has stated unequivocally that he \"played absolutely no part whatsoever\" in the MoS story, which he told me yesterday remains the case. If he did approach publishers with the manuscript, a lot of people could have tipped off the paper. What we do know is that no publisher made an offer and Mark, frustrated with Harris's failure, dispensed with his services.</p> <p>It wasn't until 9.40pm last Saturday that Campbell realised the full import of the MoS story. It wasn't just a case of reporting the fact of the book's existence after all. It also included anecdotes and incidents from the manuscript. In a hastily convened conference call with Cherie, in London, Tony Blair in Durham and Lord Falconer, it was decided that, if those details were not to gain further currency once in the public domain, they must go for an injunction. The key was the confidentiality agreement signed by Mark. She had, in Cherie's view, broken both the spirit and the letter of it. The injunction was granted, leading to the paper recalling copies and publishing a new front page.</p> <p>Though the Blairs were to issue supportive statements about Mark, stressing how much they liked her, some aides have since pointed out that she is entirely to blame for all that has happened. \"They've been over-generous really, which does them credit,\"said one. \"But you can't help feeling that Ros, or perhaps her mother, saw a chance to make a lot from their 15 minutes of fame.\"</p> <p>Mark is certainly guilty, at the very least, of naivety in thinking that - to use her own phrase - she could \"get round\" her agreement with Cherie. Having worked so closely with the Blairs, it seems remarkable, given her undoubted intelligence, that she thought publishing even an affectionate book would be possible, especially while Blair is in office.</p> <p>The Blairs have a right to feel let down. They offered the hand of friendship to Mark's family. At one time, her mother acted as a home help while her brother, Tom, also helped out. There is some incredulity at Number 10 at suggestions in the press that Tom was Blair's \"butler-cum-valet\" or even his \"personal dresser\".</p> <p>The arrangement appears to have been less a case of hired domestic service than a job creation scheme by the Blairs, an act of kindness to people who were, at the time, virtually homeless.</p> <p>The sense of personal betrayal was heightened by the fact that although Mark kept in touch regularly after leaving she never mentioned writing about the family. She even called Blair on his daughter's birthday, just three days before the MoS publication, telling the paper: \"I didn't tell him about the book.\"</p> <p>With the legal clamp still in place, the contents of the MoS story cannot be repeated or even touched upon. But it is fair to say that it contained material which was intrusive and could have been used to satirise and undermine the Blairs. Far from being an anodyne story, it was potentially harmful. It can also be seen as the thin end of the wedge. If this was allowed to pass then other revelations were bound to surface.</p> <p>That was certainly the view adopted by the judge last Friday who upheld the injunction, ruling against the MoS, a fact the MoS failed to report in its lengthy justification of its actions yesterday.</p> <p>This episode does reveal a great deal about the nature of our present society, where privacy is at a premium, human relationships have become a commodity and the prime minister is beginning to attract the kind of press hostility that is clouding editorial judgment.</p> <p>But my canvass of other editors suggests that they don't agree with the MoS, in spite of odd columnists claiming the injunction threatens press freedom. Most journalists agree, for once, with the Sun, which last week stated: \"Nobody should have the spotlight shone on everything they do in their own home. This kitchen table tittle-tattle had no public interest justification.\"</p> <p>Quite so.</p>",

On his side, Walters wanted to conceal the fact that the paper knew exactly what was in the manuscript. So the conversation was like a surreal bout of shadow boxing. My belief is that Walters was trying to provoke Campbell into launching some kind of legal action, or at least a fearsome threat of one, enabling the paper to publish a story headlined along the lines of \"Blair gags nanny\". Aware of this tactic, Campbell assumed an air of nonchalance, a reaction which probably upset Wright's plans. Walters asked Campbell if he had \"a problem\" with the paper saying that Mark was seeking a publisher for her book. Given the assurances from Mark, Campbell was noncommital. It was going to be a routine story, he thought, so he even told Walters: \"If you want a quote say 'Tony and Cherie think Ros Mark is a 100% good person. They would trust her not to say anything that would harm or embarrass the family'.\" That single conversation was to prove crucial to the storm that was to break hours later. It is possible, with hindsight, to see how important it was. For some reason, mainly due to Campbell's high regard for Mark, neither of the calls - from Mark and Walters - rang alarm bells. The woman had had an exemplary record while working for the Blairs, was loved by the children and had kept in regular touch with the family since leaving her job in August 1998. According to people close to the Blairs, she was capable, conscientious and clever. Whatever the problems and strains, she was \"a rock\", coping calmly whatever the crisis. Soon after Mark joined the household in January 1994, Cherie Blair realised her good fortune in having found her. Though sad when the nanny left, she understood: Mark wanted to put her intelligence and skills to better use by becoming a teacher. Aware of all this, Campbell's antennae were not tuned in. In an unusual example of naivety, he accepted that there was not a completed book. According to Mark, the MoS had virtually tricked their way into her house and she appears not to have informed Campbell of the extent of the \"manuscript\". He was left feeling it was an \"outline\" for a book and not the 451-page, 180,000-word document she had typed over the previous year. Mark had first been visited at her home in Galgate, near Lancaster, by the MoS's writer, Fiona Barton, on Friday afternoon. Barton wasn't invited in but Mark did confirm during a doorstep conversation that she had written a book. They parted - on friendly terms, according to the MoS, though not according to Mark - and Barton returned, with a photographer, the next day. Barton made two more visits on Saturday morning and this time she was allowed into the house, also meeting Mark's mother, Margaret, known as Mig. During the course of these visits, Mark talked much more fully about the book's content. She also posed happily for pictures and even handed over pictures of herself with the Blair family. Mark was later to claim that she posed reluctantly when told that pictures of her taken at a distance made her look \"tired\". Wouldn't she prefer to see herself looking groomed? Whether true or not, most journalists know of this ruse. During those talks, Barton came to believe that Mark did want the book published and was also hoping for a newspaper serialisation. Surely though, asked Barton, there was some kind of confidentiality agreement between her and the Blairs? Yes, replied Mark, there was. In fact, she had raised it with Cherie a couple of years into her tenure, but a friend had convinced her that it wasn't binding. At this point, the MoS's editor and lawyers knew they had to be careful. No paper has a better first-hand knowledge of the Blairs' desire to protect their children. The MoS was censured by the Press Complaints Commission last year for running a story about the schooling of Kathryn Blair, and no matter how much the adjudication rankled with Wright, he was unlikely to stray into a legal confrontation with the Blairs without taking great care. What tipped the balance was their interpretation of the Walters-Campbell call. Since Campbell knew they had been talking to the nanny and offered them a quote, it must be OK to go ahead. A splash was written with a prediction which soon turned out to be spot on: a \"sensational\" account by their nanny \"would spark a major controversy with the Blairs\". She had written it, she explained to the paper, because \"I had been part of a moment in history and I wanted to write about it for historical reasons\". The next mystery is how the paper came by Mark's manuscript in the first place. By her account, she handed a disk of her would-be book to an agent selected at random, Jonathan Harris, asking him to find a publisher. The MoS is coy about how it came to know of the book, claiming it came from \"sources in the publishing industry\". Harris has stated unequivocally that he \"played absolutely no part whatsoever\" in the MoS story, which he told me yesterday remains the case. If he did approach publishers with the manuscript, a lot of people could have tipped off the paper. What we do know is that no publisher made an offer and Mark, frustrated with Harris's failure, dispensed with his services. It wasn't until 9.40pm last Saturday that Campbell realised the full import of the MoS story. It wasn't just a case of reporting the fact of the book's existence after all. It also included anecdotes and incidents from the manuscript. In a hastily convened conference call with Cherie, in London, Tony Blair in Durham and Lord Falconer, it was decided that, if those details were not to gain further currency once in the public domain, they must go for an injunction. The key was the confidentiality agreement signed by Mark. She had, in Cherie's view, broken both the spirit and the letter of it. The injunction was granted, leading to the paper recalling copies and publishing a new front page. Though the Blairs were to issue supportive statements about Mark, stressing how much they liked her, some aides have since pointed out that she is entirely to blame for all that has happened. \"They've been over-generous really, which does them credit,\"said one. \"But you can't help feeling that Ros, or perhaps her mother, saw a chance to make a lot from their 15 minutes of fame.\" Mark is certainly guilty, at the very least, of naivety in thinking that - to use her own phrase - she could \"get round\" her agreement with Cherie. Having worked so closely with the Blairs, it seems remarkable, given her undoubted intelligence, that she thought publishing even an affectionate book would be possible, especially while Blair is in office. The Blairs have a right to feel let down. They offered the hand of friendship to Mark's family. At one time, her mother acted as a home help while her brother, Tom, also helped out. There is some incredulity at Number 10 at suggestions in the press that Tom was Blair's \"butler-cum-valet\" or even his \"personal dresser\". The arrangement appears to have been less a case of hired domestic service than a job creation scheme by the Blairs, an act of kindness to people who were, at the time, virtually homeless. The sense of personal betrayal was heightened by the fact that although Mark kept in touch regularly after leaving she never mentioned writing about the family. She even called Blair on his daughter's birthday, just three days before the MoS publication, telling the paper: \"I didn't tell him about the book.\" With the legal clamp still in place, the contents of the MoS story cannot be repeated or even touched upon. But it is fair to say that it contained material which was intrusive and could have been used to satirise and undermine the Blairs. Far from being an anodyne story, it was potentially harmful. It can also be seen as the thin end of the wedge. If this was allowed to pass then other revelations were bound to surface. That was certainly the view adopted by the judge last Friday who upheld the injunction, ruling against the MoS, a fact the MoS failed to report in its lengthy justification of its actions yesterday. This episode does reveal a great deal about the nature of our present society, where privacy is at a premium, human relationships have become a commodity and the prime minister is beginning to attract the kind of press hostility that is clouding editorial judgment. But my canvass of other editors suggests that they don't agree with the MoS, in spite of odd columnists claiming the injunction threatens press freedom. Most journalists agree, for once, with the Sun, which last week stated: \"Nobody should have the spotlight shone on everything they do in their own home. This kitchen table tittle-tattle had no public interest justification.\" Quite so.",

They did, but they played their revolutionary songs about freedom, justice, peace and unity. \"I told them afterwards that I'd been in detention and didn't have time to compose any for the occasion.\" </p> <p>The Smith regime peddled photographs of Mapfumo with Muzorewa as proof TM had crossed over; it even broadcast his songs from army helicopters hovering above war zones. It took him years to recover his reputation. \"Some people thought we had sold out,\" says Mapfumo, who cites Malcolm X and Martin Luther King as inspirations. \"They didn't realise the music had never changed.\" </p> <p>He remained prolific after Zimbabwean independence in 1980, introducing the mbira to the Blacks Unlimited line-up, releasing album after socially aware album and influencing other home-grown stars such as Oliver \"Tuku\" Mtukudzi.

When they came into power they promised us many things, but the people are still suffering and the country is a mess. So what did we fight for?\" Corruption is now so widespread that Mapfumo believes Zimbabwe would crumble without it. It's a subject he addressed in his 1990 album Chamunorwa (Corruption), which was duly banned from the state-owned media. </p> <p>Though heartened by last month's No vote on a new constitution to enhance presidential powers and allow for the seizure of white-owned land without compensation (a vote Mugabe has chosen to ignore, triggering the invasion of white-owned farms by former guerrillas), Mapfumo expects the worst for the parliamentary elections in April. (Or at least, they are due in April; no date has yet been scheduled.)

      "bodyText": "Riot police yesterday clashed with demonstrators protesting against a march through central Berlin by German neo-Nazis to show solidarity with the Austrian far-right leader J\u00f6rg Haider. Police said they arrested more than 18 anti-Nazi protesters throwing stones and bottles at some 500 members of the National Democratic party (NPD) as they marched towards the Brandenburg Gate. Attempts by the city government to ban the NPD march were rejected by the courts on Saturday. Judges ruled that the rally, held to mark the anniversary of Nazi Germany's 1938 annexation of Austria, did not pose a significant threat to public order. More than 1,500 riot police with water cannons and tear gas were on hand to stop serious clashes. The anti-Nazi demonstration was attended by the parliamentary president, Wolfgang Thierse. \"It is encouraging that so many people have turned out to demonstrate,\" he said. \"Right-wing extremism must not be given any chances in Europe.\"",

The answer could come from the latest television technology. Onscreen electronic programme guides (EPGs) are already here. Other smart machines, able to tell you what you want to watch and when you want to watch it, are not far behind. Do they herald the end of the dear old weekly TV listings magazine lying on top of your set? </p> <p>EPGs are the beginning of what OnDigital's Andrew Marre calls \"personal television\". Digital TV providers, such as Sky and Cable &amp; Wireless, all currently offer broadly similar EPG services, where part of the TV screen shows viewers what they are watching now, what they might watch on other channels and what they could be watching tomorrow. But what sounds like a souped-up Teletext is actually far more sophisticated. </p> <p>At the flick of a button on the remote, viewers can arrange channels so their favourites are first on the channel list. EPGs can also be used to order films on demand through Sky and C&amp;W, while the latter provide a search facility by programme title or genre and onscreen reminders shortly before a searched-for programme starts. </p> <p>Like forgetting your favourite programme, the days of wrestling with the video will also fade from view. US company Replay Networks have developed hardware to enable viewers to pause a \"live\" broadcast, make a cup of tea and then carry on watching. Sky have just signed a deal with Replay Networks' Silicon Valley neighbour, TiVo, to sell their personal video recorders in the UK, which will provide a beefed-up EPG of 14-days' listings plus programme recording at the touch of a \"thumbs up\" button. </p> <p>\"The next major step of our EPG is when it becomes web-based,\" says Bill Goodland, head of content production at Cable &amp; Wireless. Making EPGs part of the fast-developing TV internet firmament, Goodland argues, will provide enormous potential to link from programme descriptions to reviews. It will also provide opportunities for live chat, debate and email. </p> <p>Web-based EPGs coming through your interactive TV are mere months away and digital companies are already counting the cash flows these lucrative TV portals will bring in. Forrester Research calculate that EPGs will generate $3.2bn of advertising in the US within five years. </p> <p>\"The power of TV brands is absolutely enormous. EastEnders engages the loyalty of millions, but is almost unexploited outside the broadcast arena,\" says Goodland. </p> <p>The mobile phone will also have a crucial say in how we get our TV information. Despite signing deals with BT Cellnet and Vodaphone, Sky, like C&amp;W, remain undecided about whether to use Wap (wireless application protocol) phones for TV listings. </p> <p>Whatever they decide, a six-strong internet start-up team operating from a shed in Devon has already beaten them to it. Russ Freeman calls his DigiGuide a \"proactive agent to look out for good stuff on TV\". 75,000 users have already downloaded DigiGuide's free software, which seeks out TV choices, stores favourites, and alerts you to all programmes featuring John Wayne if you have registered such an interest. </p> <p>In a couple of weeks their new web service will be transferable on to palm pilots and Wap phones. When your Wap phone rings on the train it could be to remind you not to miss Tomorrow's World on the TV that night. </p> <p>But for the bewildered viewer who does not like the sound of the future TV world, will there still be a battered copy of a weekly listings magazine near the TV to guide them through the jungle of channels? </p> <p>The resounding verdict of almost all in digital and dog-eared media is yes. \"People are still going to flick through magazines and read columns by Alan Titchmarsh and Polly Toynbee,\" says Sky spokesman Andrew Sholl. </p> <p>\"Our customers do not just want an EPG which is like a railway timetable. They want gossip and background,\" adds Goodland. C&amp;W are currently in discussions with several potential content partners and Goodland sees the arrival of EPGs as \"a great opportunity for some of those well-known brands in the TV magazine space, like the Radio Times, to extend their presence into online and e-commerce territory\". </p> <p>Ashley Munday, the Radio Times's publisher, agrees. \"It's the first time since the deregulation of TV listings in 1990 that we are able to go on the offensive. Rather than threatening our position, the new technology is allowing us to develop.\" </p> <p>Munday wants the Radio Times to \"become the dominant broadcast publishing brand\". His strategy is to get the venerable 76-year-old TV listings magazine on to as many platforms as possible. Its 70-strong editorial team has been augmented by a digital publishing division to repackage its content for the new interactive technology, for which partners are now being courted. </p> <p>\"You can split listings into two major functions: navigation and guidance,\" says Munday. \"Navigation is what's on.

It's the only medium that you can consume while you're doing something else which, as we all get busier, is useful. And, despite the efforts of some politicians, we remain in love with our cars, which is where so many of us listen to the radio. Also radio is the preferred accompaniment of the net surfer. </p> <p>This leaves the press. The medium the doom-merchants thought would be the first to be destroyed by the internet. On the contrary, there is no evidence that the internet is reducing the popularity of the printed word. I predict that magazines will continue to proliferate. While many of their information needs are serviced by the net, people love the tactile process of turning glossy pages, and appreciate the skills of the editor and art director. As long as there isn't political interference in the freedom of our national press, I'm sure it, too, will continue to prosper. Although there is an overall decline in newspaper reading, quality newspapers are doing fine - and by \"quality\" I don't just mean the broadsheets, but all newspapers which know their audiences and deliver what their readers want. </p> <p>Finally, the regional press. The internet is thought to be especially threatening to local and regional media, particularly as they rely so heavily on classified advertising. I disagree. The regional press is a strong medium. It has powerful links with its local community, good geographical targeting capabilities, and is trustworthy. While there's scepticism about the contents of the nationals, people seem to believe what's in their local papers. </p> <p>Advertisers have been reluctant to use the regional press as a national medium, partly because it can be expensive and partly because it's like embarking on an obstacle course to run a national campaign that way. But the regional press has launched a new initiative - Creating New Perspectives - to position themselves as a national media alternative. It will make it easier to buy regional press advertising on a national basis, to supply artwork, and to improve reproduction across the myriad of titles. </p> <p>This reminds me of how radio got its act together and transformed itself into a coherent industry with a national offering.

In a series of eight essays, authors John Seely Brown, Xerox's chief scientist, and Paul Duguid, a historian and social theorist at the University of California, gently deflate the more extreme claims of \"the blinkered euphoria of the infoenthusiasts\". </p> <p>The authors make the case that reducing libraries to \"information warehouses\", universities to \"information providers\" and office work to \"information handling\" makes it easy to vastly overstate the impact that digital technology will have on society. </p> <p>At the centre of their argument is the observation that popular thinking about technology today is ruled by a kind of relentless \"endism\" which forecasts the death of everything from mass media to the nation state, government to politics, universities to regions, even distance itself.

      "bodyText": "* Katharine Mieszkowski www.salon.com The Social Life of Information dives into the muck of failed predictions to show why the future isn't likely to let go of the past. In a series of eight essays, authors John Seely Brown, Xerox's chief scientist, and Paul Duguid, a historian and social theorist at the University of California, gently deflate the more extreme claims of \"the blinkered euphoria of the infoenthusiasts\". The authors make the case that reducing libraries to \"information warehouses\", universities to \"information providers\" and office work to \"information handling\" makes it easy to vastly overstate the impact that digital technology will have on society. At the centre of their argument is the observation that popular thinking about technology today is ruled by a kind of relentless \"endism\" which forecasts the death of everything from mass media to the nation state, government to politics, universities to regions, even distance itself. It's the end of the world as we know it, and the technopundits feel fine.

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, has an unprecedented opportunity to show that Labour is the party of the family in the budget next week. </p> <p>He has already committed himself to a shake-up of the tax credit system, with a fundamental shift of resources from wallet to purse, when he was setting out ideas last autumn for an integrated child credit to be paid directly to the main carer in the family. </p> <p>He could go much further. Tax credits, the most radical anti-poverty initiative introduced by this government, boost the incomes of poor working families by, on average, \u00a324 a week. </p> <p>They can also, however, as experience in the United States has shown - have perverse and unintended effects on families, removing fathers from mainstream family life. </p> <p>Let us take a look at how the tax credit system works and the proposed reforms. </p> <p>The working families tax credit is a major weapon in the government's armoury, making work pay and tackling child poverty. The government has committed itself to halving child poverty by 2010 and abolishing it by 2020. </p> <p>The figures are startling. The number of children living in poverty has soared over the past 30 years and today over 4m live below the poverty line. </p> <p>The rise has been closely linked to two factors: the growth in the number of children with no working parent; and the rise in the number of lone parent households. </p> <p>But the WFTC only helps tackle child poverty in those families with someone in work, restricting its impact to a fraction of those who really need financial support. </p> <p>According to the treasury the new child credit would be complemented by an employment tax credit paid through the wage packet to working households - be they with or without children. </p> <p>That will allow the chancellor to extend the ambition of his anti-poverty measures, using the integrated child credit to reach every household, in or out of work. </p> <p>The new child credit should also please critics of the WFTC, such as the women's budget group, who say that the replacement of family credit by a tax credit paid to the main earner tends to take money out of the purse and put it into the wallet </p> <p>They argue that women are more likely than men are to spend the income they receive directly on the family, while men use theirs as personal spending money. </p> <p>The new child credit is likely to be paid to the main carer, alongside child benefit, overcoming this problem. </p> <p>However, there is another, less discussed, effect of the tax credit system - that is the effect on family life and particularly on fathers. </p> <p>Almost half of tax credit recipients at the moment are lone parents in low-paid jobs. But the design of the WFTC penalises single parents who wish to take a long-term partner or declare if they are living with the father of their child. </p> <p>Take, for instance, a mother with two children working full time and earning the minimum wage. After the WFTC is calculated she receives \u00a3199.53 a week. </p> <p>If she marries another minimum wage worker their income would be \u00a3256.80 with the tax credit. But if she does not declare that she has a partner their joint income would be much higher - \u00a3317.26. In other words, she is penalised by more than \u00a360 a week for declaring her partner. </p> <p>One solution is to move towards what has been called \"income splitting\" - that is, adding both partners' incomes together, splitting the total in half, and calculating the credit on each half. With no change in behaviour, the treasury has estimated that the cost of such a policy, combined with a reduction in the income at which credits start to be withdrawn, from \u00a390 to \u00a345 a week, could be up to \u00a35bn. </p> <p>But that could be lowered by phasing in the reforms, or lowering the level at which the taper cuts in. It is also likely that behaviour would change if the system were reformed, reducing the number of claims. </p> <p>Reforming the system may be expensive. But it is a small price to pay if the result is that fathers resurface in low-income communities, reinvigorating family life. </p> <p>\u0095 Reforming the Working Families Tax Credit - How an Integrated Child Credit Could Work for Families and Children, by Ruth Kelly, MP for Bolton West, is published this week by the Fawcett Society</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, has an unprecedented opportunity to show that Labour is the party of the family in the budget next week. He has already committed himself to a shake-up of the tax credit system, with a fundamental shift of resources from wallet to purse, when he was setting out ideas last autumn for an integrated child credit to be paid directly to the main carer in the family. He could go much further. Tax credits, the most radical anti-poverty initiative introduced by this government, boost the incomes of poor working families by, on average, \u00a324 a week. They can also, however, as experience in the United States has shown - have perverse and unintended effects on families, removing fathers from mainstream family life. Let us take a look at how the tax credit system works and the proposed reforms. The working families tax credit is a major weapon in the government's armoury, making work pay and tackling child poverty. The government has committed itself to halving child poverty by 2010 and abolishing it by 2020. The figures are startling. The number of children living in poverty has soared over the past 30 years and today over 4m live below the poverty line. The rise has been closely linked to two factors: the growth in the number of children with no working parent; and the rise in the number of lone parent households. But the WFTC only helps tackle child poverty in those families with someone in work, restricting its impact to a fraction of those who really need financial support. According to the treasury the new child credit would be complemented by an employment tax credit paid through the wage packet to working households - be they with or without children. That will allow the chancellor to extend the ambition of his anti-poverty measures, using the integrated child credit to reach every household, in or out of work. The new child credit should also please critics of the WFTC, such as the women's budget group, who say that the replacement of family credit by a tax credit paid to the main earner tends to take money out of the purse and put it into the wallet They argue that women are more likely than men are to spend the income they receive directly on the family, while men use theirs as personal spending money. The new child credit is likely to be paid to the main carer, alongside child benefit, overcoming this problem. However, there is another, less discussed, effect of the tax credit system - that is the effect on family life and particularly on fathers. Almost half of tax credit recipients at the moment are lone parents in low-paid jobs. But the design of the WFTC penalises single parents who wish to take a long-term partner or declare if they are living with the father of their child. Take, for instance, a mother with two children working full time and earning the minimum wage. After the WFTC is calculated she receives \u00a3199.53 a week. If she marries another minimum wage worker their income would be \u00a3256.80 with the tax credit. But if she does not declare that she has a partner their joint income would be much higher - \u00a3317.26. In other words, she is penalised by more than \u00a360 a week for declaring her partner. One solution is to move towards what has been called \"income splitting\" - that is, adding both partners' incomes together, splitting the total in half, and calculating the credit on each half. With no change in behaviour, the treasury has estimated that the cost of such a policy, combined with a reduction in the income at which credits start to be withdrawn, from \u00a390 to \u00a345 a week, could be up to \u00a35bn. But that could be lowered by phasing in the reforms, or lowering the level at which the taper cuts in. It is also likely that behaviour would change if the system were reformed, reducing the number of claims. Reforming the system may be expensive. But it is a small price to pay if the result is that fathers resurface in low-income communities, reinvigorating family life. \u0095 Reforming the Working Families Tax Credit - How an Integrated Child Credit Could Work for Families and Children, by Ruth Kelly, MP for Bolton West, is published this week by the Fawcett Society",

The prime minister has been told by the treasury that a shortfall on the project will have to be met by the injection of taxpayers' money. The plan's initial investment costs of \u00a37bn have now risen to around \u00a312bn. The project's architect, John Prescott, had hoped that sufficient funds would be found from the private sector over the 30-year period of the contract. But bidders for the contract, due to be finalised in April 2001, say that they are not prepared to bear the shortfall in the escalating costs. The government also has to bear in mind that the fares on the underground will have to be kept to reasonable limits. Ministers are unlikely to accept independent forecasts that fares on the tube would have to rise by at least 30% to offset the cost of the huge project. Fierce opposition to the public-private partnership (PPP) by Mr Livingstone in the mayoral election has raised fears among some bidders that the project to upgrade the tube could fold. Peter Mason, chief executive of the construction group Amec, which is bidding for two of the three contracts, said: \"We have long been concerned about the political impact of the PPP on the mayoral election.\" Ministers are convinced that some bidders are using the threat of Mr Livingstone's election as a bargaining tool to cut the price. But treasury officials admit that the shortfall is real and that taxpayers will have to support the project. Some bidders have offered to reduce their price by up to 33% if London Underground allows them to shut down large sections of the system for several months at a time to speed up building work, and to contain costs. But LU has rejected this plan as politically unacceptable. Bidding for two of the tube contracts must be submitted to Mr Prescott by the end of the month. These are for the deep tube lines. The remaining bid for the sub-surface lines, including the Metropolitan and Circle lines, has been delayed because Mr Prescott decided to withhold the contract from Railtrack after the Paddington train disaster last October. Contractors have until August to bid for this contract. The PPP does not fall into the mayor's jurisdiction until the contract is signed, although the mayor will be responsible for transport in the capital, including the operation of services and the setting of fares.

As a last resort, Mr Prescott can pull back from signing the PPP if he feels that the bids do not offer value for money. This would be regarded by Mr Livingstone as a vindication of his opposition to the PPP. Treasury estimates put the shortfall on the project at \u00a3200m a year for the duration of the 30-year contract.

Great going! The Republicans have shot their prospects in the foot. New Labour would appear to have shot itself in the head. Blah about loyalty and broken promises turns to ashes in the mouth.</p> <p>And see how inevitably re-adjustment follows imbecility. McCain has gone, but he doesn't intend to be forgotten. He will have to be placated - and already the GOP's spin doctors peddle the thought that, after Bush's inevitable defeat, a chastened party might turn to a 67-year-old war hero in 2004. Hang in there boy; they're serving jam tomorrow.</p> <p>Meanwhile Mr Livingstone is beginning to wallow in jam today. Will Labour party members who give him a hand be disciplined or expelled? Er, no: there are too many of them. Will Downing Street decline to work with a Livingstone London administration? Er, no: what government heading into a general election wants to penalise 5m voters for being wrong? Will Millbank, all adjectives blazing, go down with the Titanic called Dobbo? Apparently not: the bilges have dried up already and only bizarre leaks about Irish \"distress\" at his mayoralty swill below decks.</p> <p>The machine's minders, in short, would appear to be edging towards a bizarre neutrality. They can't unleash a TV fortune's worth of negative advertising against Livingstone. (And, even if they could, the bullying would rebound). They can't shut him out of the publicity race, because most of his publicity comes free. They can't rely on the foot soldiers of doorstep canvassing, who mostly voted for Ken in the first place. They can't resuscitate Frank Dobson by feeding him Clint Eastwood's leftover lines. Nobody can remake his day.</p> <p>W hy keep banging your head against a wall? The prudent recourse in adversity (an American way) would be to withdraw the \"official\" candidate, issue no further \"advice\" to Labour voters and sit the weeks till May 4 out. That way you don't have to keep eating humble pie round the clock. But party machines - like supertankers - have an interminable turning circle.</p> <p>There are two schools of received wisdom about this fiasco. One is that, in a while, it won't matter because peo ple forget and winning general elections is a different game. The other is that the sheer incompetence of the past few months has wiped away the sheen of Blair hegemony for ever. Actually, both of those verdicts may be right. The polls of popularity set on Blair, but the Hague never rises.</p> <p>There is, though, a deeper and more durable lesson. Simply: that in a largely non-ideological age, the voters have grown cynical, too. They think that machine fixes insult their intelligence. They can't relate to nouveau apparatchiks like Paul Boateng spouting pre-rehearsed texts like George W Bush on speed. Loyalty? Where is compassion as poor, loyal Dobbo is cut adrift? Moral disgust at Ken's \"broken word\"? It is a signal (and little-mentioned) fact that Bill Clinton's approval rating today - on the last Opinion Dynamics poll - stands at 66%: better than Reagan, better by far than the president's election- winning score in '96, the age before Monica.</p> <p>What counts in this new age of politics is prosperity delivered, good jokes, straight talk and a semblance of humanity. The levers of schmaltz on the fabled machines are broken, hanging loose. And those of us who don't want to vote Livingstone will have to find a damned good reason not to. Ah!

First, the wildlife bill delivered almost everything the environmentalists had wanted on protecting wild animals as well as, after 65 years of campaigning, the right to roam.</p> <p>Last week the government came up trumps on climate change; fears that New Labour would renege on its manifesto commitment to a 20% cut in carbon dioxide by 2010 proved groundless. The United Kingdom can now rightly claim to be a world leader in cutting carbon emissions, and John Prescott will play a key role in the Hague in November in developing the international architecture needed to implement the targets agreed at Kyoto. What is more, environment minister Michael Meacher made it clear that this is just an instalment towards the target of 60-70% cuts by 2050.</p> <p>Of course, environmentalists still have gripes. They complain the government has failed to grasp the nettle on transport; traffic figures continue rising. They want changes in the planning system to match a Danish-style push for the adoption of wind power.

      "bodyText": "The green lobby has had much to celebrate lately. First, the wildlife bill delivered almost everything the environmentalists had wanted on protecting wild animals as well as, after 65 years of campaigning, the right to roam. Last week the government came up trumps on climate change; fears that New Labour would renege on its manifesto commitment to a 20% cut in carbon dioxide by 2010 proved groundless. The United Kingdom can now rightly claim to be a world leader in cutting carbon emissions, and John Prescott will play a key role in the Hague in November in developing the international architecture needed to implement the targets agreed at Kyoto. What is more, environment minister Michael Meacher made it clear that this is just an instalment towards the target of 60-70% cuts by 2050. Of course, environmentalists still have gripes. They complain the government has failed to grasp the nettle on transport; traffic figures continue rising. They want changes in the planning system to match a Danish-style push for the adoption of wind power. But in the big picture, after a long wait, New Labour has finally begun to deliver on the environment.

      "body": "<p>\"It would be enormously helpful, Senator Pinochet, if you claimed you were a member of the IRA\", the pinstripe-suited man with a briefcase labelled LAWYER tells the glum Chilean ex-dictator. The lawyer in the cartoon looks nothing like Pinochet's solicitor, Michael Caplan, but then Caplan's features are hardly well known. Throughout his client's 16-month sojourn as a hostage to Spanish and British justice, he eschewed the TV interviews and newspaper soundbites. He decided not to fight the issues in the media, but to keep the arguments for court. Only now, his client safely back in Santiago, has he agreed to an interview.</p> <p>The walls of Caplan's tiny, functional office in London's Clerkenwell are hung with cartoons, most of them marking the highlights of the case of a lifetime. Above his desk, the room's only touch of colour is a court artist's drawing of the historic scene in the House of Lords when the law lords pronounced their final judgment removing the legal obstacles to Pinochet's extradition to Spain to face torture charges. Caplan appears as an anonymous figure in a far corner, belying his central role in the saga.</p> <p>After 16 months on the unrelenting rollercoaster the case turned out to be, he admits he breathed a sigh of relief when the Chilean air force 707 taxied down the runway 10 days ago, within hours of Jack Straw's decision that the general was unfit to stand trial and would not be extradited to Spain. As the plane started to move, \"there was a great sense with all the officials there, of witnessing a bit of history\".</p> <p>He almost ended up as an extra to the jubilant entourage when he boarded the plane to hand the general the plate Lady Thatcher had entrusted to him. She had left strict instructions that Caplan, who travelled to Waddington airbase as part of the convoy, should hand over the plate, inscribed \"Margaret Thatcher\", only when his client was safely on the plane. But his getaway wasn't as swift as he'd planned. \"A lot of people wanted to say goodbye to me and express their thanks, which I found rather embarrassing - embarrassing in the sense that I have a role to play and my role was to deal with the legal issues. It was only when I got off that I was told they had closed the doors and taken the steps away. They had had to put the steps back up.\"</p> <p>Only when the plane took off could Caplan be sure that his client was safely on his way home to Chile at last. Up to that point, a last-ditch legal challenge by human rights groups or one of the four countries seeking his extradition could have blocked his departure.</p> <p>Tension was high as the convoy headed down the motorway. \"I realised that even though we'd received the decision from the home office at eight o'clock that morning, the case was far from over. I had set up direct links with my office so I would be informed on a separate line whilst we were moving up the A1. I had to take along a separate mobile because the press had got hold of my mobile number.

      "bodyText": "\"It would be enormously helpful, Senator Pinochet, if you claimed you were a member of the IRA\", the pinstripe-suited man with a briefcase labelled LAWYER tells the glum Chilean ex-dictator. The lawyer in the cartoon looks nothing like Pinochet's solicitor, Michael Caplan, but then Caplan's features are hardly well known. Throughout his client's 16-month sojourn as a hostage to Spanish and British justice, he eschewed the TV interviews and newspaper soundbites. He decided not to fight the issues in the media, but to keep the arguments for court. Only now, his client safely back in Santiago, has he agreed to an interview. The walls of Caplan's tiny, functional office in London's Clerkenwell are hung with cartoons, most of them marking the highlights of the case of a lifetime. Above his desk, the room's only touch of colour is a court artist's drawing of the historic scene in the House of Lords when the law lords pronounced their final judgment removing the legal obstacles to Pinochet's extradition to Spain to face torture charges. Caplan appears as an anonymous figure in a far corner, belying his central role in the saga. After 16 months on the unrelenting rollercoaster the case turned out to be, he admits he breathed a sigh of relief when the Chilean air force 707 taxied down the runway 10 days ago, within hours of Jack Straw's decision that the general was unfit to stand trial and would not be extradited to Spain. As the plane started to move, \"there was a great sense with all the officials there, of witnessing a bit of history\". He almost ended up as an extra to the jubilant entourage when he boarded the plane to hand the general the plate Lady Thatcher had entrusted to him. She had left strict instructions that Caplan, who travelled to Waddington airbase as part of the convoy, should hand over the plate, inscribed \"Margaret Thatcher\", only when his client was safely on the plane. But his getaway wasn't as swift as he'd planned. \"A lot of people wanted to say goodbye to me and express their thanks, which I found rather embarrassing - embarrassing in the sense that I have a role to play and my role was to deal with the legal issues. It was only when I got off that I was told they had closed the doors and taken the steps away. They had had to put the steps back up.\" Only when the plane took off could Caplan be sure that his client was safely on his way home to Chile at last. Up to that point, a last-ditch legal challenge by human rights groups or one of the four countries seeking his extradition could have blocked his departure. Tension was high as the convoy headed down the motorway. \"I realised that even though we'd received the decision from the home office at eight o'clock that morning, the case was far from over. I had set up direct links with my office so I would be informed on a separate line whilst we were moving up the A1. I had to take along a separate mobile because the press had got hold of my mobile number. There were lawyers and police officers in the car and every time the phone rang, everyone looked anxiously at it.\" The case had taken over much of Caplan's life since the Friday in October 1998 when Pinochet was arrested. He needed a lawyer fast. Kingsley Napley, Caplan's firm, was recommended for its international law reputation - one of his partners, Stephen Pollard, had represented rogue trader Nick Leeson - and Caplan, with previous experience in extradition cases, met the Pinochet family on the Sunday. Kingsley Napley supports Amnesty International, the human rights group that worked hard to deliver Pinochet to his Spanish accusers, but there was never any question of turning the ex-dictator down. Unlike barristers, solicitors are not obliged to take on any client who seeks their help, but criminal lawyers are not in the business of turning away unpopular clients. If they were, hate figures like Myra Hindley, Ian Brady, Harold Shipman and Fred and Rosemary West would go unrepresented. Caplan, who sits as a part-time judge for four weeks a year, sees himself as fulfilling a professional role, like a doctor, who would never refuse to treat a patient just because he he was accused of heinous crimes. He will not divulge where his own political sympathies lie but most criminal lawyers, who tend to have an anti-establishment streak, are more likely to be leftish than rightish in their views. He faced abuse from human rights campaigners and was even assaulted coming out of court, but he makes no complaint. \"I'm a great believer in free speech.

President Bill Clinton's refusal to allow Apache helicopters to attack Serb positions did nothing to improve the prickly relationship between General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme allied commander who complained he was having to fight a war with one hand tied behind his back, and the Pentagon. And when Nato later turned on a wide range of economic and industrial targets across Serbia, the bombing almost inevitably led to the deaths of more innocent civilians. British ministers were forced to defend the attack on the Serbian television headquarters in Belgrade, which led to several civilian deaths, describing it as a \"legitimate military target\".",

But what was originally a disappointing placement at St Mary's, Durham University's unique single-sex college, soon became a love affair and now she is celebrating an important step towards maintaining her college's women-only status.</p> <p>Ask fellow student Sally Cheesman what is so special about an all-women college and she begins by describing a boarding school atmosphere, where they all go to breakfast in their pyjamas. But her focus intensifies as she speaks of a support system like no other. \"When someone's ill, we look after her. When someone's stuck on an essay, we encourage her and give her advice if we can.\"</p> <p>Why would that necessarily be different if there were men here? \"I don't know, but it would change things. It's not like we don't interact with the mixed student body - we do, every day. But here, where we live, we have our own space.\"</p> <p>A space of her own has undergone many different meanings in the past 150 years. The first women's college in Cambridge had to be built two miles from the city limits, lest the mingling of the sexes distract one and deprave the other. But to have their own space meant being able to have an education (albeit not, until 1948, a degree) and many women were grateful for that.</p> <p>Long after mixed schooling became commonplace, the perks of separate spaces emerged in surprising ways. If school space is shared, the boisterous boys take teachers' attention from the quieter girls. Girls can lose their footing among more confident boys. Any unease they have with science and maths is compounded by assumptions that \"these aren't girls' subjects anyway\". If the class is girls-only, the teacher inevitably fosters girls' abilities. There are strong educational arguments for separate schools.</p> <p>Recent trends in grades, with girls showing more gains than boys (in mixed and single-sex schools), show teachers have become skilled in overcoming prejudice. We hear about the \"Can Do Girls\": confident, motivated, optimistic. But these forward-looking young women have a history and we should take lessons from that history before we conclude that the value of a special women's space is obsolete.</p> <p>In the 60s and 70s, the women's movement was a bid for women to get out of what was defined as their space - the kitchen or the home - into the world abroad. They did this by joining other women, in a very different kind of women-only space. This was the space indicated on the cover of Marilyn French's cult consciousness-raising novel, in which \"Ladies\" on a lavatory door is crossed out and replaced with \"Women\". In a ladies' room, there's female-only space, but the label implies social control. In the women's room, they break with ladylike conventions and become self-aware people who fight for their rights. From the networks formed in the women's room, they stepped into male cultures of work and politics.</p> <p>Finding space here was a slow and uncomfortable process. They kept guard, careful not to be too feminine. They dressed soberly, lowered their voices, preened themselves to be tough and competitive. Some social critics have argued that this was the time when the skinny female figure became an ideal. Thinness shaved away womanly features and minimised the space she took up.</p> <p>The expectation was that once enough women entered the workplace, they wouldn't have to conform to a male model. Management expert Rosabeth Moss Kanter estimated that when women form 15% of employees, they have a comfortable presence. Less than that and they suffer a strange combination of invisibility (too few to be noticed) and exposure (so odd as to be a freak).</p> <p>Now there are more women in the workplace, there's a lot of talk about its feminisation. This means the styles and values associated with women (caring, nurturing) are marketable. No longer do managers issue orders. Instead they listen and collaborate. In principle, being macho (except over working hours) is frowned upon and sensitivity rewarded.</p> <p>Well, maybe. Many organisations are high on feminine-value vocabulary but not on real value for what's feminine. A 1998 survey of 5,000 enterprises in the EU showed the average profile of the British female manager has changed little since the 80s. She is less likely to be married and twice as likely to be divorced as her male counterpart. She also earns less, even at director level. The workplace may have changed style but to call it \"feminised\" is stretching the term. A feminised place is one in which women's needs meet with a direct, intuitive response. These places tend to be populated by women.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a strong argument against women-only spaces is that they are a throwback to earlier times when women were kept in \"their proper place\". Some years ago, I was in a mixed college that wanted to have a women's meeting place. The bursar couldn't understand us. Having fought so hard to enter a man's world, we now seemed to be engaging in a voluntary retreat.</p> <p>Retreat? That has two meanings: losing ground in a war and a safe haven. A woman's space is not a retreat in the slow march towards equality, but it is a retreat where one can gain strength and regroup. Sometimes it is no more than a girls' night out, sometimes it is three years in a women-only college.</p> <p>As with all retreats, reality is waiting. \"Life is about getting out and mixing with other people,\" Sally Cheesman reflects. \"I love being at St Mary's now and I'll always appreciate a women's environment, but I won't always have one.\"</p> <p>Emily Agg-Manning believes, however, that she can take this special place with her. \"I have gained an inner confidence here. Nothing and no one could make me feel that women aren't equal to anything.\" Wherever that knowledge is provided is a good educational space.</p> <p>* St Mary's is not the only all-female college: three at Cambridge (Newham, New Hall, Lucy Cavendish) and one at Oxford (St Hilda's) are men-free.</p> <p>* Legislation originally designed to increase opportunities for women often present a threat to women's institutions. For example, Oxford University is prevented by law from funding academic posts advertised for women only, so St Hilda's has to fund them itself and is said to be running out of money. Thanks to a different administrative structure, Cambridge can sidestep sex discrimination law.</p> <p>* The University Women's Club in Mayfair was founded in 1886 by 300 women campaigning to get women accepted into university. Its 1,200 members include Betty Boothroyd, Barbara Mills, Judi Dench and PD James. Unlike many gentlemen's clubs, the average age of members is falling, thanks to an influx of women in their 20s.</p>",

When someone's stuck on an essay, we encourage her and give her advice if we can.\" Why would that necessarily be different if there were men here? \"I don't know, but it would change things. It's not like we don't interact with the mixed student body - we do, every day. But here, where we live, we have our own space.\" A space of her own has undergone many different meanings in the past 150 years. The first women's college in Cambridge had to be built two miles from the city limits, lest the mingling of the sexes distract one and deprave the other. But to have their own space meant being able to have an education (albeit not, until 1948, a degree) and many women were grateful for that. Long after mixed schooling became commonplace, the perks of separate spaces emerged in surprising ways. If school space is shared, the boisterous boys take teachers' attention from the quieter girls. Girls can lose their footing among more confident boys. Any unease they have with science and maths is compounded by assumptions that \"these aren't girls' subjects anyway\". If the class is girls-only, the teacher inevitably fosters girls' abilities. There are strong educational arguments for separate schools. Recent trends in grades, with girls showing more gains than boys (in mixed and single-sex schools), show teachers have become skilled in overcoming prejudice. We hear about the \"Can Do Girls\": confident, motivated, optimistic. But these forward-looking young women have a history and we should take lessons from that history before we conclude that the value of a special women's space is obsolete. In the 60s and 70s, the women's movement was a bid for women to get out of what was defined as their space - the kitchen or the home - into the world abroad. They did this by joining other women, in a very different kind of women-only space. This was the space indicated on the cover of Marilyn French's cult consciousness-raising novel, in which \"Ladies\" on a lavatory door is crossed out and replaced with \"Women\". In a ladies' room, there's female-only space, but the label implies social control. In the women's room, they break with ladylike conventions and become self-aware people who fight for their rights. From the networks formed in the women's room, they stepped into male cultures of work and politics. Finding space here was a slow and uncomfortable process. They kept guard, careful not to be too feminine. They dressed soberly, lowered their voices, preened themselves to be tough and competitive. Some social critics have argued that this was the time when the skinny female figure became an ideal. Thinness shaved away womanly features and minimised the space she took up. The expectation was that once enough women entered the workplace, they wouldn't have to conform to a male model. Management expert Rosabeth Moss Kanter estimated that when women form 15% of employees, they have a comfortable presence. Less than that and they suffer a strange combination of invisibility (too few to be noticed) and exposure (so odd as to be a freak). Now there are more women in the workplace, there's a lot of talk about its feminisation. This means the styles and values associated with women (caring, nurturing) are marketable. No longer do managers issue orders. Instead they listen and collaborate. In principle, being macho (except over working hours) is frowned upon and sensitivity rewarded. Well, maybe. Many organisations are high on feminine-value vocabulary but not on real value for what's feminine. A 1998 survey of 5,000 enterprises in the EU showed the average profile of the British female manager has changed little since the 80s. She is less likely to be married and twice as likely to be divorced as her male counterpart. She also earns less, even at director level. The workplace may have changed style but to call it \"feminised\" is stretching the term. A feminised place is one in which women's needs meet with a direct, intuitive response. These places tend to be populated by women. Nevertheless, a strong argument against women-only spaces is that they are a throwback to earlier times when women were kept in \"their proper place\". Some years ago, I was in a mixed college that wanted to have a women's meeting place. The bursar couldn't understand us. Having fought so hard to enter a man's world, we now seemed to be engaging in a voluntary retreat. Retreat? That has two meanings: losing ground in a war and a safe haven. A woman's space is not a retreat in the slow march towards equality, but it is a retreat where one can gain strength and regroup. Sometimes it is no more than a girls' night out, sometimes it is three years in a women-only college. As with all retreats, reality is waiting. \"Life is about getting out and mixing with other people,\" Sally Cheesman reflects. \"I love being at St Mary's now and I'll always appreciate a women's environment, but I won't always have one.\" Emily Agg-Manning believes, however, that she can take this special place with her. \"I have gained an inner confidence here. Nothing and no one could make me feel that women aren't equal to anything.\" Wherever that knowledge is provided is a good educational space. * St Mary's is not the only all-female college: three at Cambridge (Newham, New Hall, Lucy Cavendish) and one at Oxford (St Hilda's) are men-free. * Legislation originally designed to increase opportunities for women often present a threat to women's institutions. For example, Oxford University is prevented by law from funding academic posts advertised for women only, so St Hilda's has to fund them itself and is said to be running out of money. Thanks to a different administrative structure, Cambridge can sidestep sex discrimination law. * The University Women's Club in Mayfair was founded in 1886 by 300 women campaigning to get women accepted into university. Its 1,200 members include Betty Boothroyd, Barbara Mills, Judi Dench and PD James. Unlike many gentlemen's clubs, the average age of members is falling, thanks to an influx of women in their 20s.",

The work, costing \u00a3800,000, goes against all recent restorations. \"We could have recreated the original appearance,\" said Mr Bryant. \"There would have been just one problem: the paintings would have looked disgusting.\" When Lord Iveagh died in 1927, he had not begun redecorating Kenwood - so English Heritage and Mr Cobbe took their lead from his homes in Ireland. The dining room curtains are a direct copy of those made in Dublin in 1828 for another Irish mansion, Mr Cobbe's family home.",

Addressing members of the Australia-Ireland Fund in Melbourne, he said: \"It would make an immense contribution to confidence-building if the public could feel assured that every organisation that was involved in the Northern Ireland conflict accepts that a return to an armed campaign is not an option. \"But all of us, not least the two governments, have an absolute obligation to ensure that all aspects of the [Good Friday] agreement are implemented in full. \"This includes the de-escalation of military dispositions by the security forces as provided for in the agreement, especially in certain border areas such as South Armagh, where they are still a source of harassment and annoyance.\" His call came four days after the Irish foreign minister, Brian Cowen, said the nationalist communities needed to see politics were working: \"If there is a reality for people in nationalist areas [it is] that the security presence, far from decreasing since the ceasefire has, if anything, increased in some instances.\" The Stormont assembly was suspended last month due to an impasse over decommisioning. Since then, intense discussions have been taking place. Yesterday Mr Ahern also said that the best way to resolve the crisis would be to first reinstate the assembly. Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, made a similar plea yesterday at a Belfast rally. Little progress is expected before Northern Ireland politicians arrive in Washington later this week for St Patrick's Day celebrations, where president Bill Clinton will host informal talks.",

      "body": "<p>All too often, documentaries consist of little else than men with nasty ponytails riding around in the back of jeeps claiming that something interesting once happened on a drab piece of Turkish roadside. Either that, or the special effects team get so carried away with a new piece of software that we're left squinting through the hi-tech equivalent of Vaseline on the lens. So it's a surprise and a delight to find an unashamedly old-fashioned doc on BBC2 - one that lets the story speak for itself. </p> <p>And what a story. <strong> Moral Combat - Nato At War</strong> (Sunday) unfolded with calm authority the ugly story of the Nato campaign in Kosovo, from its beginnings as a local guerrilla war through the stupendous bunglings of the diplomatic process to a bloody conclusion. Two hours is a long time in TV, particularly when there's no sex and precious few laughs, but Allan Little's film never flagged, never dipped into sentimentality and kept even the worst-informed viewer up to speed with a narrative of Byzantine complexity. To no one's surprise, the politicians emerged with egg all over their faces, confessing that they had no control over a situation that they pretended was a masterpiece of international co-operation. The Americans, among them Madeleine Albright, were politely evasive, stressing tactics over casualties; Tony Blair at least had the grace to admit that war is a messy business and that people will get hurt. </p> <p>What seemed like a nightmare at the time appears as a monumental balls-up with the benefit of hindsight. Nightly bombing schedules were leaked by Nato officers to the Yugoslavian government; General Nebojsa Pavkovic, commander of the Yugoslav army in Kosovo, actually winked to an off-camera crony when describing his success in avoiding air strikes. At the end of the conflict, peace was brokered by a shady Swedish financier. It was all very Jack Higgins. </p> <p>The most effective moments - deployed sparingly - came from footage captured by cameras in the nose-cones of Nato missiles as they showered over Kosovo. There can be no image more acute of the role of communications technology in modern warfare. </p> <p>ITV's Sunday night drama <strong> Hero Of The Hour</strong> deployed a much cruder special effect in the looming form of Ross Kemp, fresh out of EastEnders, with a lot to prove. Dramas featuring ex-EastEnders are ten a penny these days - some of us are still hoping that Punk Mary will get the break she deserves, by the way - but even so, Kemp seemed more than most a big fish in a small pond. Would he have what it takes to break out of soap? </p> <p>We needn't have worried, for he deftly sidestepped the issue by playing, basically, Grant in a funny hat. Richie Liddle was a security guard, and thus Kemp joins the ranks of ex-EastEnders who have gone straight into uniform (Nick Berry and Paul Nicholls as policemen, Michael French as a surgeon). He bravely foiled a warehouse burglary, got himself shot in the leg and then, in a moment of aberration, decided to nick the money himself. This lapse haunted him for the rest of the show, which lasted for another two hours, during which time Kemp looked alternately cross and confused.

      "bodyText": "All too often, documentaries consist of little else than men with nasty ponytails riding around in the back of jeeps claiming that something interesting once happened on a drab piece of Turkish roadside. Either that, or the special effects team get so carried away with a new piece of software that we're left squinting through the hi-tech equivalent of Vaseline on the lens. So it's a surprise and a delight to find an unashamedly old-fashioned doc on BBC2 - one that lets the story speak for itself. And what a story. Moral Combat - Nato At War (Sunday) unfolded with calm authority the ugly story of the Nato campaign in Kosovo, from its beginnings as a local guerrilla war through the stupendous bunglings of the diplomatic process to a bloody conclusion. Two hours is a long time in TV, particularly when there's no sex and precious few laughs, but Allan Little's film never flagged, never dipped into sentimentality and kept even the worst-informed viewer up to speed with a narrative of Byzantine complexity. To no one's surprise, the politicians emerged with egg all over their faces, confessing that they had no control over a situation that they pretended was a masterpiece of international co-operation. The Americans, among them Madeleine Albright, were politely evasive, stressing tactics over casualties; Tony Blair at least had the grace to admit that war is a messy business and that people will get hurt. What seemed like a nightmare at the time appears as a monumental balls-up with the benefit of hindsight. Nightly bombing schedules were leaked by Nato officers to the Yugoslavian government; General Nebojsa Pavkovic, commander of the Yugoslav army in Kosovo, actually winked to an off-camera crony when describing his success in avoiding air strikes. At the end of the conflict, peace was brokered by a shady Swedish financier. It was all very Jack Higgins. The most effective moments - deployed sparingly - came from footage captured by cameras in the nose-cones of Nato missiles as they showered over Kosovo. There can be no image more acute of the role of communications technology in modern warfare. ITV's Sunday night drama Hero Of The Hour deployed a much cruder special effect in the looming form of Ross Kemp, fresh out of EastEnders, with a lot to prove. Dramas featuring ex-EastEnders are ten a penny these days - some of us are still hoping that Punk Mary will get the break she deserves, by the way - but even so, Kemp seemed more than most a big fish in a small pond. Would he have what it takes to break out of soap? We needn't have worried, for he deftly sidestepped the issue by playing, basically, Grant in a funny hat. Richie Liddle was a security guard, and thus Kemp joins the ranks of ex-EastEnders who have gone straight into uniform (Nick Berry and Paul Nicholls as policemen, Michael French as a surgeon). He bravely foiled a warehouse burglary, got himself shot in the leg and then, in a moment of aberration, decided to nick the money himself. This lapse haunted him for the rest of the show, which lasted for another two hours, during which time Kemp looked alternately cross and confused. Range isn't something that you'd expect from a man who looked cross and confused for nearly ten years in Albert Square, but at least Kemp has a certain physical charisma. The rest of the cast, notably Maggie O'Neill as his justifiably fed-up wife, acted rings around the star as he groped towards some kind of personal peace. Sadly, this came at least half an hour too late, by which time audiences must surely have dropped off and thus missed the edifying sight of Kemp cuddling a baby that looked exactly like him - bald, wide-eyed and a bit dazed.

The pair are off to the Cornish moors to collar the ghastly hound that's been eating the unfortunate Baskerville clan. Suspenseful to the end, this is the one that ends with addict Holmes calling for his needle. Killer's Kiss (Stanley Kubrick, 1955) 6pm, FilmFour The late Kubrick's second feature is a modest but poignant melodrama, shot on location in New York with $75,000 provided by friends and family. Jamie Smith is a recently KO'd boxer rescuing dance hostess Irene Kane from her vicious boyfriend-come-boss Frank Silvera: a good deed that lands them both in trouble. A familiar thriller plot, atmospherically shot in monochrome, but with little to hint at the grand visions to come. Reach The Rock (John Hughes, 1998) 8pm, Sky MovieMax An interesting experiment from former teen obsessive Hughes, albeit one that fails comprehensively. Smalltown drifter smashes window.

The parents have lived in Switzerland for more than 12 years, have no criminal record, speak Swiss-German dialect and hold steady jobs with a local engineering firm. Their two sons were born and educated in Switzerland and play for the local football team. But when the Yugoslav couple's bid for Swiss passports was submitted to a local referendum yesterday, along with that of 52 other applicants, their neighbours in the industrial town said no. Armed with a brochure with the address, photograph, CV and tax details of the 56 applicants, Emmen's electorate - on a 54% turnout - accepted only eight of them, all Italians. Nonetheless, the Avramovics and the others, mainly Yugoslavs, are still legally entitled to stay in Switzerland with their existing work permit. The exercise appears to be little more than an outlet for fear and prejudice. The result also confirmed a trend that emerged last year in neighbouring regions, where only EU nationals gained widespread acceptance. Under pressure from the rightwing Swiss People's party, the practice of asking the local electorate to pick new citizens has slowly been gaining ground in central Switzerland over the past two years. Emmen's result indicates that the process is institutionalising xenophobia. While it is limited to only a few dozen nationality applications every year, the People's party wants to expand the process to major cities such as Zurich and Berne - to the alarm of anti-racism groups. Switzerland's unique system of direct democracy is coveted, and reactions from opponents of the People's party have been muted. Even the official racism watchdog is waiting for the results of a comparative study of the country's complex array of local citizenship procedures. \"We don't know at all if there's a link between democratic choice and racial discrimination,\" Bo\u00ebl Sambuc, the vice-president of the Federal Commission against Racism, said. \"But this method implies that people judge you on something that's inherent, your origin - not your individual behaviour.

      "bodyText": "Japanese police were embarrassed at the weekend by revelations that they sub-contracted the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult to write software for supposedly secret operations. As a result of this glaring breach of security, the Supreme Truth cult - public enemy number one since it killed 12 people and injured thousands of others in a nerve gas attack on the Tokyo underground in 1995 - gained access to classified information and earned 2m yen (\u00a311,950) from the police. It is the latest evidence of the ease with which computer companies linked to Aum have penetrated the top echelons of the Japanese government, including the defence agency, as well as many of the country's biggest companies and academic institutions. Last month the defence force, which controls one of the world's most powerful military arsenals, had to suspend part of its computer network after discovering that the Aum firm was one of the installation sub-contractors. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, the metropolitan police department contracted IBM Japan to set up a computer system to manage its patrol cars, some of which were likely to have been involved in monitoring the cult. Part of this job was sub-contracted through a complex series of channels to Vainqueur, a software firm affiliated to Aum, for about 2m yen. Neither IBM nor the police were aware of the identity of their software provider until a month before the new system was to go into operation in early 1998, by which time the cult had already seen classified data on the deployment of 115 police vehicles, including unmarked cars. In a frantic effort to minimise the damage, police took some of the cars out of use and changed the licence plates on others. The revelations represent a blow to the police, whose previously strong public image has taken a hammering in recent weeks with revelations of drug-taking, cover-ups and negligence. But they are not alone in providing funds and secret information to Vainqueur. It has also emerged that cult members worked on computer systems at the construction, education and telecommunications ministries, as well as at key corporations such as NTT, Kiyo Bank and the East Japan Railway. In recent raids of cult facilities, inspectors have found a database with information on thousands of officials at Japanese corporations. Police suspect that the cult's computer companies stole this and other data. Neither Aum or the police have commented on the latest revelations. The 2,000-member cult has recently enacted a series of reforms, including changing its name to Aleph and disavowing the teachings of its guru, Shoko Asahara, in an effort to counter a police crackdown and growing public pressure for the cult to disband.",

Huge losses of livestock have directly affected 500,000 people, 20% of Mongolia's population, the report said, adding: \"The famine will continue for at least the next 12 months.\" Mounting livestock deaths in the coming months are expected to add to the problems of the herding population, which has already seen 1.5m animals perish owing to insufficient fodder, it said. Many herders have lost almost all their animals - the only source of food, transport, heating materials, purchasing power and access to medical services and children's education. The report recommended immediate shipment of animal fodder, food supplements and veterinary medicines. Reuters, Ulan Bator Russian rocket fails to launch A Russian space launch ended in failure yesterday, sending its US payload plunging towards earth, a spokesman for Russian mission control said. Interfax news agency said the payload was a communications satellite built by the US firm Hughes. Mission control said the Zenit-3 SL rocket, launched from a ship at the equator, failed 467 seconds into its flight. The spokesman initially said it was a Ukrainian rocket carrying a Ukrainian payload but later said it was American. Reuters, Moscow Sharif wife accused of treason Police have filed a complaint against the wife of Pakistan's deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif, accusing her of treason after she criticised the military government that toppled her husband, authorities said yesterday. Khulsoom Sharif and several leaders of her husband's Pakistan Muslim League are accused of inciting people against the state in speeches in Hyderabad last week. Under Pakistan's legal system, a police complaint is the initial step before formal charges are filed. Mrs Sharif said she had spoken out against the October 12 army coup that ousted her husband. \"Now they have gone to the extent of framing a woman like me on treason charges,\" she said. \"I have come out of the house for democracy and to save the life of my husband. Mr Sharif, his brother and five aides are on trial on hijacking, treason, kidnapping and attempted murder charges. Reuters, Karachi",

Mr Aznar had urged voters not to jeopardise the country's economic success by opting for a leftwing alliance between the Socialists and Communists. The Socialist leader Joaquin Almunia, 51, accused the government of practising \"crony capitalism\" which has enriched a few personal friends of the prime minister but done little for the population as a whole. Mr Aznar, 47, a former tax inspector once ridiculed as too dull to last in office, heads one of the few conservative governments in the European Union. He cast his vote in Madrid shortly after polls opened, telling voters: \"Have a nice election day.\" Mr Almunia, speaking at his Madrid polling station, called for a large turnout, something that some political analysts said could favour his centre-left party. Spain's 34m voters were choosing their eighth government since democracy was restored after the death of the fascist dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The threat of Basque terrorist violence has loomed over the election. On Saturday evening, youths linked to the Basque separatist group ETA threw petrol bombs at a government tax office in the coastal resort of San Sebastian. They also poured glue into the locks of several polling stations. ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna, boycotted the elections in protest at the government's refusal to contemplate independence for the Basque country.

      "body": "<p>Hundreds of grieving relatives gathered at a pithead in eastern Ukraine yesterday to mourn the victims of Europe's worst mine disaster in 20 years as the death toll from the Barakova mine tragedy rose to 82.</p> <p>The president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, cancelled a foreign trip as a government inquiry was launched into the cause of the explosion more than 610 metres (2,000ft) below ground, believed to have been sparked by a lethal mix of coal dust and methane gas.</p> <p>The death toll made Saturday's Barakova mine disaster in the small town of Sukhodolsk the worst since 84 miners were killed in a colliery explosion in 1980, also in Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the mining industry in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine has gone into steep decline, making the the region the most dangerous in Europe for a miner.</p> <p>In a region that now presents a bleak picture of destitution, 297 miners were killed last year, and 360 in 1998. The Barakova disaster brought the death toll in Ukraine's mining industry to more than 120 in the first 10 weeks of the year. Experts have calculated that five miners die in Ukraine for every million tonnes of coal extracted.</p> <p>The Donbass coal industry employs more than half a million people at more than 200 pits, which are starved of investment. Miners go unpaid for months and valuable materials are routinely pilfered. Safety rules are generally flouted and management knowingly exposes employees to lethal risks to pocket profits.</p> <p>\"Disasters happen every day here,\" said an EU official who is advising the Ukrainian government on how to restructure its coal industry. \"Carelessness is the most common cause of accidents.\"</p> <p>At the Barakova mine about 200 miners staged an underground strike last year to demand their wages. Several threatened to commit suicide, and when they surfaced many bore self-inflicted knife wounds, marks of desperation.</p> <p>The mother of one dead miner told journalists at the pithead yesterday that her husband had died previously in the same mine. \"May this mine be cursed. I hate it.\"</p> <p>\"In all the years I've being doing this I've never seen so many bodies. It was a nightmare,\" said one of the rescue workers bringing corpses out from the shaft. \"They all died of suffocation and burns in the coal dust explosion.\"</p> <p>President Kuchma said more than \u00a31m was being made available for the families of the dead. At the same mine last year he accused \"unscrupulous directors\" at unnamed mines of \"criminal dealings\" by ignoring safety and pushing production to pocket the mine's earnings. The mine is owned by a Ukrainian state holding company.</p> <p>The local trade union leader said the management at the 43-year-old pit regularly ignored breaches of safety to increase output. \"The extra tonnes are paid for with the miners' lives.\"</p> <p>\"This is really the worst catastrophe in the history of Ukrainian independence,\" said the energy minister, Serhiy Tulub. More than 200 workers were in the mine at the time of the explosion, 91 in the vicinity. Officials said the number of dead rose from 80 on Saturday to 82 yesterday, with four escaping unhurt and the remainder in hospital.</p> <p>The eastern region of Luhansk, where the mine is situated, is also experiencing many cases of tuberculosis. Local hospitals, which were previously funded by the mines, now rely on patients' families to pay for treatment.</p>",

The president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, cancelled a foreign trip as a government inquiry was launched into the cause of the explosion more than 610 metres (2,000ft) below ground, believed to have been sparked by a lethal mix of coal dust and methane gas. The death toll made Saturday's Barakova mine disaster in the small town of Sukhodolsk the worst since 84 miners were killed in a colliery explosion in 1980, also in Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the mining industry in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine has gone into steep decline, making the the region the most dangerous in Europe for a miner. In a region that now presents a bleak picture of destitution, 297 miners were killed last year, and 360 in 1998. The Barakova disaster brought the death toll in Ukraine's mining industry to more than 120 in the first 10 weeks of the year. Experts have calculated that five miners die in Ukraine for every million tonnes of coal extracted. The Donbass coal industry employs more than half a million people at more than 200 pits, which are starved of investment. Miners go unpaid for months and valuable materials are routinely pilfered. Safety rules are generally flouted and management knowingly exposes employees to lethal risks to pocket profits. \"Disasters happen every day here,\" said an EU official who is advising the Ukrainian government on how to restructure its coal industry. \"Carelessness is the most common cause of accidents.\" At the Barakova mine about 200 miners staged an underground strike last year to demand their wages. Several threatened to commit suicide, and when they surfaced many bore self-inflicted knife wounds, marks of desperation. The mother of one dead miner told journalists at the pithead yesterday that her husband had died previously in the same mine. \"May this mine be cursed. I hate it.\" \"In all the years I've being doing this I've never seen so many bodies. It was a nightmare,\" said one of the rescue workers bringing corpses out from the shaft. \"They all died of suffocation and burns in the coal dust explosion.\" President Kuchma said more than \u00a31m was being made available for the families of the dead. At the same mine last year he accused \"unscrupulous directors\" at unnamed mines of \"criminal dealings\" by ignoring safety and pushing production to pocket the mine's earnings. The mine is owned by a Ukrainian state holding company. The local trade union leader said the management at the 43-year-old pit regularly ignored breaches of safety to increase output. \"The extra tonnes are paid for with the miners' lives.\" \"This is really the worst catastrophe in the history of Ukrainian independence,\" said the energy minister, Serhiy Tulub. More than 200 workers were in the mine at the time of the explosion, 91 in the vicinity. Officials said the number of dead rose from 80 on Saturday to 82 yesterday, with four escaping unhurt and the remainder in hospital. The eastern region of Luhansk, where the mine is situated, is also experiencing many cases of tuberculosis. Local hospitals, which were previously funded by the mines, now rely on patients' families to pay for treatment.",

      "body": "<p>At 94, Lord Longford, the prisoner's friend, is the oldest sitting member of the House of Lords. He is an ancient will o' the wisp, his head a boiled sweet from which his few strands of hair stand upright as if under electric shock.</p> <p>His teeth look as if they've melted together. But he is sharp as a tack. \"Is this on the record? Stop writing,\" he orders at one point. \"You asked me a question. Let me finish,\" he barks at another. He spits \"No. Never,\" several times. \"Are you a homo?\" he asks the photographer, who's taking a close-up. \"I support homosexuals, I always have,\" (though he doesn't believe, he adds, in lowering the age of consent). Does he have homosexual colleagues in the House. \"What?\" he says. \" Elderly gentlemen? Elderly gentlemen homosexuals? There were many homos at Eton and Oxford, but in the House of Lords? Elderly gentlemen. No, no, no.\"</p> <p>We're talking in a small dark anteroom, just along from the debating chamber. He spoke last week on the reform of the House of Lords. Twelfth speaker. Just before 6pm. Eight minutes. He always keeps to eight minutes. \"It takes people years to understand there's something called attention span. Do you understand?\" he says. The day before this he was visiting Dennis Nilsen.</p> <p>Longford is, famously, Myra Hindley's longest supporter. He implies an indirect involvement in last week's judgment disallowing Brady from starving himself to death. \"It's simple enough. He should not be allowed to die because he's in hospital, the responsibility of those who look after him. It would be different if you told me you wanted to die because of an unhappy love affair. But if the man's mental, he's your responsibility.\" There are pearls of spittle in the corners of his mouth, and on his lapel. \"I told them that. I told him that too when he talked to me about it.\" He bangs the table with his hand, keeping time to his own drum.</p> <p>He might have banged it a bit too loudly, because it's about then that I tell him he's being a bit frightening. \"What?\" he says. \"Frightening? What? Oh God. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm awfully sorry. Was I being frightening? I'm sorry. No, no, no. I am a timid soul. Oh God. Oh God, what can I do about it? I'm awfully sorry. Oh God, I am going to have to ask forgiveness. I mean, I'm 'frightening'. What can I do - kneel in front of you?\" He has been flopping about from side to side, and now, a Catholic since his conversion in 1940, he makes a flamboyant sign of the cross. It's all I can do to stop him falling to the floor. \"I'll have to confess to it later. But how do I? Do I crawl in front of you?\"</p> <p>How seriously should one take Francis Aungier Pakenham, KG, PC, 7th Earl of Longford? In his time he has been called \"Lord Porn\", \"the Loony Lord\" (The Sun), \"a strayed and silly old goat\" (Jean Rook), and \"a dangerous and woolly-minded buffoon whose views are taken seriously because of his accidental social status\" (Anne West, the mother of one of Brady and Hindley's victims). Dick Crossland described his cabinet career after the war as \"farcical\". Harold Wilson, who removed him from the front bench to make him leader of the Lords in 1964, said he had \"the judgment of a 12-year-old\". \"People have called me a lot, which is extremely annoying,\" says Longford, \"including effing pervert as you know.\"</p> <p>But age has its benefits. And to some Longford has attained the status of a national treasure. \"If you want to know what Christianity is,\" wrote the commentator AN Wilson last week, \"look at the life of Lord Longford. Year in, year out has found him changing trains on windy platforms and journeying all over the country to visit prisons. Contemplating his bald old head, I wish there were a God and imagine if there were one he would be just like Lord Longford.\"</p> <p>So, I put it to him. Effing pervert or the closest thing to God we have? Longford gives a smirk. \"I suppose if I were a holy man I would obtain a whip and lash myself,\" he says. \"Wonderful of Andrew [Wilson].\"</p> <p>Conversing with Longford involves a series of such mental adjustments. Within the good Catholic references to forgiveness and redemption, he strikes notes that are disconcertingly off-key. There is the combination of self-flagellation and name-dropping - only natural from a man who has known Gaitskill and Keynes, Beveridge and Betjeman, and whose close family members include Antonia Fraser and Rachel Billington (daughters), Anthony Powell and Harold Pinter (brother-in-law and son-in-law respectively). At times it strays into moral greyness. He vehemently defends Jonathan Aitken for example, piling scorn on the Guardian for \"hounding him\". But he lied. \"Only a very little lie,\" he says. \"And anyway he acknowledged it.\" But only after he was forced to. \"Well done Guardian,\" says Longford sarcastically. \"Anyway,\" he adds, \"I'm biased if you like. I knew his grandfather, Lord Rugby. I knew his mother...\"</p> <p>So far as Hindley and Brady are concerned, he says Myra is \"a good woman, a good Christian woman\". But there is something disconcertingly jolly in his description of Brady as \"brilliant bonkers\". He calls Brady and Hindley's relationship \"a marriage made in heaven\" and there's quite a long pause before he remembers to add \"or hell\". He says their cleverness was really \"unlike working class people\" and that it doesn't surprise him that people find it hard to forgive them. \"It's only natural. People are ignorant.\"</p> <p>Does he never find it hard to separate the sin from the sinner? \"No because it's happened already. I mean Nilsen strangled 12 people-\" He makes a comic motion at his neck to illustrate this. \"But when you meet him you can't imagine him doing it. If you saw it happening, who knows?\"</p> <p>He has been married for 70 years to Elizabeth, a royal biographer. He can't imagine life without her, but to hope to go first would be: \"Very selfish. I will be feeble, but to wish that would be contemptible.\" They have had eight children, one of whom, Catherine, died in a car crash at the age of 23. I ask if his religion helped him then. He says: \"I'm sure it helped Elizabeth. She became a Catholic herself about that time. But for me? Not quite so much. A man doesn't feel the same as a woman.\"</p> <p>All in all, he says, he is a second-rate father. \"I did my duty. The boys were at Ampleforth up in Yorkshire and I went up to visit them for what seemed like about 20 years so I did my duty.\" He seems momentarily distracted. \"There are some wonderful fathers,\" he adds. \"I saw Lord Shawcross, who is the oldest member of the House (though he doesn't come) and his son, who is himself quite old, at a party a while ago and the son kissed his father on the lips. Well you know that's lovely but it's so remote from the way I was bought up.\"</p> <p>Longford's father was a war hero and was killed at Gallipoli. Even his older brother, \"the fattest man in Ireland\", who died in 1961, had \"guts\" and came out as a supporter for Sinn Fein while at Eton \"so was a hero in his way\". Longford was invalided out of the army during the war (after a nervous breakdown) and has taken refuge in failure ever since. \"I think that was very helpful,\" he says. \"I was a total failure and now today I'm partially sighted. I hobble about with a stick. If you're a peer, you've been a cabinet minister, you're interviewed by the Guardian, you might think of yourself as superior to other people but old age has the one advantage that you can't.\"</p> <p>\"I'm a very self-critical person,\" he continues happily. \"My record says that. I started as a Conservative, became Labour. Started as some sort of Protestant, became Catholic. Didn't have much use for Irish nationalism, became a champion- You can't do all these things if you're not a critical person. Even today, I'm wondering how to lead a better life.\" But doesn't he have a place booked in heaven? \"God, no,\" he says. \"I want to be purified long before that. I wouldn't like to arrive in heaven and someone say, 'OK Longford, what do you like playing?' 'I like playing tennis.' 'Come in, we've got lovely courts.' That's a really appalling thought: to spend the rest of eternity no better than you are now.\"</p> <p>One of the things that will keep him in purgatory, he says, is impatience.</p> <p>He calls a halt to the interview then and takes me to tea where he's meeting a neighbour from the country who has some points to raise with him about the position of widows in the House. \"I wrote to you,\" she tells him. \"But you must have been very busy because you didn't answer.\"</p> <p>Longford, who suddenly appears to have gone a little more deaf, bows his head and sways guiltily. When she goes on to mention another occasion in which he \"waved her away\", he starts swooning and moaning again. \"I waved you away. Oh God, I waved you away. How awful of me. Oh God. What can I do?\" She outlines her argument once more. By the time the cakes arrive it's obvious his patience has run out. \"Write to me about it, write to me,\" he mutters, lost in his fondant fancy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>'I liked the verdict so much, I wish I could have bought the jury,\" said Victor Kiam as he emerged from the high court on Friday after winning his libel case against the Mirror. As we chatted in the taxi taking us back to his suite at Claridge's the quip seemed to please him as much as the \u00a3105,000 plus costs he had just won from the newspaper which last year made the mistake of suggesting he was losing his touch.Kiam wasn't in London for the money - after 30 years as a successful entrepreneur, he isn't short of that - but for the principle. \"What the Mirror's City Slickers had written about me and the Ronson company was grossly unjust. Everything was wrong. When that article ran, we had just gone through six months when we had straightened everything out. But the Mirror said I was about to close everything down. I'm sitting there thinking 'I've worked my ass off but it's all been worth it' and I read a headline saying, 'He's had it, he's over the hill.' \"</p> <p>The Mirror had offered him an eleventh-hour settlement, but he had refused: \"I wanted to really win so that the world would know that I won. You have to be careful about what is written on financial matters so that the city pages of newspapers don't become gambling tout sheets.\"</p> <p>Kiam spent more than a day in the witness box, and the jury warmed to him. He is a funny, engaging, leathery 73-year-old who looks like an ageing crooner, dresses nattily and talks with a streetwise New York accent (though he was born in New Orleans and can drawl with the best of them down south). \"I feel like a 21-year-old who still wants to see the future, and I am enjoying making the future come sooner,\" he told the court in a virtuoso performance. Mirror editor Piers Morgan and the ex-Slickers opted to miss the show.</p> <p>The attractive thing about Victor Kermit Kiam II is that, though every inch a successful American capitalist, he is the antithesis of corporate man: he is a risk-taker whose speciality is turning companies round (hence his involvement in the mid-90s with the ailing Ronson). He puts in his own money and then pitches into the management of the company, too. \"An entrepreneur not only innovates,\" he explains, \"but works his tail off to make sure the project succeeds.\"</p> <p>He loves gadgets and fishes the new Ronson disposable lighter out of his pocket to demonstrate it. His current enthusiasms include a pair of ear-plugs which combat that buzzing in the ears you get on planes and a health light for people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder.</p> <p>\"I like products and services that have something unique about them,\" he says. \"If you don't have something different, you have to create it. For example, Remington: the killer was 'shaves as close as a blade or your money back'; it was a guarantee that it would match whatever you did with a blade. You can't advertise a me-too product, you've got to have some differential. I believe in advertising; my whole career has been advertising.\"</p> <p>That statement is literally true because what made Kiam into a household name were the Remington ads - \"I liked it so much I bought the company\" - in which he starred for 15 years after buying the firm in 1979. When Kiam was discussing the deal, his wife Ellen bought him a Remington shaver to try out, and he was suitably impressed. When he told his UK ad agency the story, they saw an opportunity and thought about getting Kevin Keegan to appear in the ads. Kiam couldn't see the logic in that and insisted on doing them himself. An advertising classic was born.</p> <p>\"I did a couple of commercials coming out of the bathroom in a bath-robe,\" he recalls. \"The other ones I did from a desk, but you couldn't get any depth on the camera because the office wasn't big enough, so I sat on the edge of the desk and was shot from the waist up. People thought I was a midget and they were amazed at how tall I was when they met me in person.\"</p> <p>Kiam had an unconventional upbringing, and perhaps that explains his pleasingly idiosyncratic approach to business - and to life. His parents were divorced when he was three, and he was brought up in New Orleans by his grandparents (his grandfather was an artist - significant, perhaps); at 11 he headed north and alternated between mother and father before going to a boarding school and then into the navy, in time to escort Atlantic convoys in the latter part of the war. Post-demob, he went to Yale (economics), the Sorbonne (languages) and Harvard (the all-important MBA), before living out of a suitcase for Lever Bros and spending more than a decade with Playtex.</p> <p>He left Playtex, where he was head of marketing, in 1968 when it was bought by a corporate raider intent on breaking up the business. He disliked asset stripping then, and he dislikes it still. \"I don't go into things because I can sell this, sell that, and be left with a chunk of cash,\" he says. \"I may have to sell some things to keep the core business, but that's only the first step to build. I have one great weakness - once I get into something, it becomes a child; I can't get rid of it. A lot of the businesses I've gone into, I went into because I enjoy.

      "bodyText": "'I liked the verdict so much, I wish I could have bought the jury,\" said Victor Kiam as he emerged from the high court on Friday after winning his libel case against the Mirror. As we chatted in the taxi taking us back to his suite at Claridge's the quip seemed to please him as much as the \u00a3105,000 plus costs he had just won from the newspaper which last year made the mistake of suggesting he was losing his touch.Kiam wasn't in London for the money - after 30 years as a successful entrepreneur, he isn't short of that - but for the principle. \"What the Mirror's City Slickers had written about me and the Ronson company was grossly unjust. Everything was wrong. When that article ran, we had just gone through six months when we had straightened everything out. But the Mirror said I was about to close everything down. I'm sitting there thinking 'I've worked my ass off but it's all been worth it' and I read a headline saying, 'He's had it, he's over the hill.' \" The Mirror had offered him an eleventh-hour settlement, but he had refused: \"I wanted to really win so that the world would know that I won. You have to be careful about what is written on financial matters so that the city pages of newspapers don't become gambling tout sheets.\" Kiam spent more than a day in the witness box, and the jury warmed to him. He is a funny, engaging, leathery 73-year-old who looks like an ageing crooner, dresses nattily and talks with a streetwise New York accent (though he was born in New Orleans and can drawl with the best of them down south). \"I feel like a 21-year-old who still wants to see the future, and I am enjoying making the future come sooner,\" he told the court in a virtuoso performance. Mirror editor Piers Morgan and the ex-Slickers opted to miss the show. The attractive thing about Victor Kermit Kiam II is that, though every inch a successful American capitalist, he is the antithesis of corporate man: he is a risk-taker whose speciality is turning companies round (hence his involvement in the mid-90s with the ailing Ronson). He puts in his own money and then pitches into the management of the company, too. \"An entrepreneur not only innovates,\" he explains, \"but works his tail off to make sure the project succeeds.\" He loves gadgets and fishes the new Ronson disposable lighter out of his pocket to demonstrate it. His current enthusiasms include a pair of ear-plugs which combat that buzzing in the ears you get on planes and a health light for people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder. \"I like products and services that have something unique about them,\" he says. \"If you don't have something different, you have to create it. For example, Remington: the killer was 'shaves as close as a blade or your money back'; it was a guarantee that it would match whatever you did with a blade. You can't advertise a me-too product, you've got to have some differential. I believe in advertising; my whole career has been advertising.\" That statement is literally true because what made Kiam into a household name were the Remington ads - \"I liked it so much I bought the company\" - in which he starred for 15 years after buying the firm in 1979. When Kiam was discussing the deal, his wife Ellen bought him a Remington shaver to try out, and he was suitably impressed. When he told his UK ad agency the story, they saw an opportunity and thought about getting Kevin Keegan to appear in the ads. Kiam couldn't see the logic in that and insisted on doing them himself. An advertising classic was born. \"I did a couple of commercials coming out of the bathroom in a bath-robe,\" he recalls. \"The other ones I did from a desk, but you couldn't get any depth on the camera because the office wasn't big enough, so I sat on the edge of the desk and was shot from the waist up. People thought I was a midget and they were amazed at how tall I was when they met me in person.\" Kiam had an unconventional upbringing, and perhaps that explains his pleasingly idiosyncratic approach to business - and to life. His parents were divorced when he was three, and he was brought up in New Orleans by his grandparents (his grandfather was an artist - significant, perhaps); at 11 he headed north and alternated between mother and father before going to a boarding school and then into the navy, in time to escort Atlantic convoys in the latter part of the war. Post-demob, he went to Yale (economics), the Sorbonne (languages) and Harvard (the all-important MBA), before living out of a suitcase for Lever Bros and spending more than a decade with Playtex. He left Playtex, where he was head of marketing, in 1968 when it was bought by a corporate raider intent on breaking up the business. He disliked asset stripping then, and he dislikes it still. \"I don't go into things because I can sell this, sell that, and be left with a chunk of cash,\" he says. \"I may have to sell some things to keep the core business, but that's only the first step to build. I have one great weakness - once I get into something, it becomes a child; I can't get rid of it. A lot of the businesses I've gone into, I went into because I enjoy. They weren't necessarily money making.\" Kiam is chairman of 10 companies - including Remington and Ronson - and has realised that retirement is not for him. \"I decided to retire in 1995 and I was going to live permanently in Florida. I loved January; February was OK; March, I was getting awfully itchy; and by April I said 'Is this what I'm going to be doing?' I like to play tennis, but I didn't want to play tennis every day.\" He still lives in Florida, but the tennis and his beloved bridge are now mixed with the deal-making and company- doctoring that became a way of life after he left Playtex. Maybe the Slickers didn't realise what they were taking on when they refused to apologise to Kiam.

      "body": "<p>War crimes trials of old Nazis, Bosnian butchers, Chilean dictators and African warlords are now a fixture of the international human rights agenda. But in January, the anti-Nazi partisan \"hero\" Vasily Kononov, 77, made legal history when he was sentenced to six years in prison in Latvia for war crimes committed in the cause of anti-fascism.</p> <p>Riga court's guilty verdict against Kononov was the first time in the former Soviet Union, and perhaps anywhere in Europe, that a second world war combatant who fought on the winning side against the Nazis had been convicted for war crimes. \"It's a unique case in Latvia, certainly, and perhaps not only here,\" admits Andris Gulans, head of Latvia's supreme court.</p> <p>On May 27 1944, Kononov, then a 22-year-old former Red Army soldier who had been parachuted by the Russians behind German lines to command a unit of 18 guerrillas, moved with his men into the eastern village of Mazie Bati in the densely wooded countryside of Nazi- occupied Latvia.</p> <p>It was a mild Saturday evening and the men of the village were relaxing over a customary drink after their weekly scrub in the communal bathhouse. Kononov and his men wore stolen German uniforms and fraternised with the locals, many of whom were familiar to the young anti-Nazi commander, who had been born in another hamlet nearby. Then the partisans, led by Kononov, unleashed their machine guns on several of the villagers. Six men and three women, one heavily pregnant, were killed.</p> <p>A few months later the Russians displaced the Nazis as Latvia's occupying power. Kononov was on the winning side. A year after the incident, the second world war ended. Kononov went on to make a career in the police through the years of Soviet rule of Latvia.</p> <p>Since 1945 there have been attempts to prosecute anti-fascist fighters for war crimes in Austria and Italy. But the attempts failed, says Winfried Garscha, a war crimes historian at Vienna's Wartime Resistance Documentation Centre. \"I don't know of any cases like this one in Latvia,\" he adds.</p> <p>The Latvian justice minister, Valdis Birkavs, bluntly insists it matters not a jot who won the war or who perpetrated the crimes. \"War criminals have to be prosecuted. Innocent men and women were killed. Justice is justice.\"</p> <p>But Villis Samsons, a historian and wartime commander of 3,000 Latvian partisans, is outraged at the Kononov verdict, which he sees as a deliberate attempt by the new Latvian state to rewrite history and \"condemn and discredit the entire partisan movement that fought against Hitler. Why don't they do something about the real war criminals who organised the Holocaust in Latvia?\"</p> <p>Samsons is not alone in his outrage. Russia is incensed and is seeking international support against the verdict, demanding that the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe lean on the Latvians to release Kononov. But, says Birkavs, \"the OSCE has no mandate to mediate in this.\"</p> <p>Boris Yeltsin, Russia's former president, refused to accept Latvia's highest state award in protest at the Kononov verdict. The acting president, Vladimir Putin, offered Kononov and his family political asylum. The case, Putin warned, could herald \"mass prosecution of fighters against fascism\". Last week, the Latvian embassy in Moscow was daubed in paint and its windows smashed.</p> <p>Latvia's troubled wartime past and its current dilemmas in dealing with that past suddenly leapt on to Britain's front pages at the beginning of this year when Konrad Kalejs, 88, a former Nazi collaborator and a member of Latvia's vicious Arajs militia - which butchered tens of thousands, mainly Jews - was discovered living in Britain, in a Midlands nursing home . Then last month, Kalejs, an Australian citizen, fled to Melbourne to avoid deportation from Britain. The home secretary, Jack Straw, had ruled that there was insufficient evidence against him to warrant prosecution in the UK. Latvia, too, says it is unable to mount a case against Kalejs.</p> <p>The contrast between the Kononov and Kalejs cases is striking. \"The Latvians have never asked for anyone's extradition for war crimes,\" says Efraim Zuroff, the Nazi war crimes researcher who heads the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem and who has been lobbying heavily in the Kalejs case. \"Not once of their own volition have the Latvians prosecuted anyone for the murder of the Jews, in great contrast to the energy with which they are trying to bring communists to trial.\"</p> <p>Three days after the Nazis arrived in Riga in July 1941, Latvian anti-semites torched Riga's main synagogue. Within six months, 60,000 of Latvia's pre-war Jewish community of 80,000, one of the most prosperous communities in eastern Europe, had been massacred. Latvians played a prominent role in the mass killings.</p> <p>Kalejs's Arajs militia rounded up Jews, took them to the Rumbula forest and Salaspils concentration camp outside Riga and shot them. The Riga ghetto was emptied to accommodate Jews who had been deported by the Nazis from Germany and Austria.</p> <p>The Holocaust historian Professor Raul Hilberg writes that \"on a per capita basis, the Latvians were represented as heavily as any nation in the destruction of the Jews\".</p> <p>By 1943 there were two Latvian SS divisions and around 100,000 Latvians were in German uniform, either in auxiliary police units or in the SS legion. Unusually, the Nazis dispatched their Latvian collaborators way beyond their native territory, to Byelorussia, Ukraine and Warsaw.</p> <p>The SS legionnaires are now feted in Latvia as freedom fighters. This Thursday, March 16, the SS veterans will march to the soaring art deco Freedom and Fatherland monument in central Riga as they have for the past seven years. Last year, the government decreed the day a national holiday. This year, however, because of international protest, it will be an unofficial holiday only.</p> <p>Ausma Rubene, one of the prosecutors in the Kononov case, cites the Allies' charter for the postwar Nuremberg tribunal as one of the legal foundations for putting Kononov on trial, although the first words of the charter specify that the tribunal is to try \"major war criminals of the European Axis\".</p> <p>\"The Red partisans were stealing food and clothes and torching houses,\" says Mrs Rubene. \"Kononov committed war crimes against peaceful civilians.\" When questioned further, she admits that the male villagers, in a region that was close to the frontline in 1944, were armed. \"They had rifles, but they were not a fascist armed formation. They were given rifles to defend themselves and their homes.\"</p> <p>Three months earlier, in the same village of Mazie Bati, there was a day-long battle between German troops and a Red Army reconnaissance unit in which 14 Russians were herded into the village bathhouse and burnt alive. That, at least, is the partisan version. The deaths aren't contested, but Rubene says the bathhouse was set ablaze accidentally by tracer fire.</p> <p>\"We know there were three women killed [on May 27],\" says former partisan leader Samsons. \"That was unfortunate, but there was a war on and it was very cruel. And the armed men in the village were auxiliary police for the German occupiers. They would round up deserters and turn them over to the Germans.\"</p> <p>The bitterness triggered by the Kononov trial and Latvia's ambivalence towards its wartime past is fuelled by its hostility towards the Russians. \"Latvia sees the war as two occupations, one bad, one good and the good one is the German,\" says a western observer in Riga.</p> <p>It was Stalin, not Hitler, who ended Latvia's independence and occupied the Baltic state in 1940, ushering in a year-long reign of terror that saw tens of thousands of Latvians killed or sent to Siberia. When the Nazis drove out the Red Army in 1941, the Germans were seen by many as liberators.</p> <p>\"It's the Soviet occupiers who have to be blamed first for the Holocaust here,\" says Professor Aivars Stranga, a Riga historian heading a national commission on the war years. \"Not every Latvian was a fascist and not every Latvian wanted to kill Jews. Stalin created the second world war when he divided Poland and Europe into spheres of influence.\" Kononov's crimes against civilians, he adds, \"were terrible, the same level of barbarity as sending people to Auschwitz\".</p> <p>While Latvia has not sought to try Kalejs or mounted any other prosecutions of pro-Nazi war criminals, the authorities point out that the Soviet powers did a thorough job in the postwar years, putting more than 2,000 Latvians on trial for war crimes. \"We want to put Nazis on trial but it was all done during Soviet times,\" says the justice minister, Birkavs. But rather than seeking to put ageing Nazis on trial, Latvia, says Zuroff, of the Wiesenthal Centre, is quietly rehabilitating dozens of convicted Nazi war criminals while prosecuting the likes of Kononov. Zuroff says 41 war criminals have been pardoned since Latvia achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. That means they qualify for pensions and perks denied to old anti-Nazi fighters.</p> <p>A week after Kononov got six years, president Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia told the Holocaust Remembrance conference in Stockholm that the \"precise number\" of Latvians who participated in the mass murder of Jews was \"not known but was estimated to exceed 1,000\".</p> <p>Nazi-hunters and historians say that that figure is risibly low. But while Latvia is not preparing any Nazi war crimes trials, Aleksandrs Ogurcovs, Kononov's lawyer, says that he expects another six prosecutions of anti-Nazi fighters. \"Only in Latvia,\" he says. \"I've never heard of anyone who fought the Germans being jailed for war crimes.\"</p>",

We are saying at the very least shareholders should make their decision with their eyes open about the wider implications. So bidders should be required to make some sort of social and environmental impact statement.\" </p> <p>The government's two-year project to transform Britain's Victorian corporate legal structure will report on Wednesday. It will reject calls to broaden directors' legal duties and force companies to report on a wide range of non-financial issues. But it is expected to suggest that directors should take a broad, long-term view, and to encourage broader reporting while stopping short of making that mandatory. </p> <p>In its analysis, The Corporate Reporting Jigsaw, the centre says business is not ready even for the recommendations of the legal review. Conventional annual reports need to be scrapped because they are a symptom of a malaise which has led to public disillusionment with the business world. </p> <p>Instead reports should include \"soft and future\" issues, including social and environmental factors, as well as indicators measuring relationships with customers and other stakeholder groups. </p> <p>\"Within two years the glossy annual report will be history,\" Mr Goyder said. \"The challenge is to broaden the range of indicators which are in regular use by companies as part of the process of performance measurement and properly audited reporting.\"</p>",

The losers will be those who only disclose what is dragged out of them.\" Mr Goyder said directors needed to consider the interests of customers, employees and other stakeholders but this was difficult when faced with a takeover bid. \"At that point they have to concentrate on the worth of the offer for today's shareholders. We are saying at the very least shareholders should make their decision with their eyes open about the wider implications. So bidders should be required to make some sort of social and environmental impact statement.\" The government's two-year project to transform Britain's Victorian corporate legal structure will report on Wednesday. It will reject calls to broaden directors' legal duties and force companies to report on a wide range of non-financial issues. But it is expected to suggest that directors should take a broad, long-term view, and to encourage broader reporting while stopping short of making that mandatory. In its analysis, The Corporate Reporting Jigsaw, the centre says business is not ready even for the recommendations of the legal review. Conventional annual reports need to be scrapped because they are a symptom of a malaise which has led to public disillusionment with the business world. Instead reports should include \"soft and future\" issues, including social and environmental factors, as well as indicators measuring relationships with customers and other stakeholder groups. \"Within two years the glossy annual report will be history,\" Mr Goyder said. \"The challenge is to broaden the range of indicators which are in regular use by companies as part of the process of performance measurement and properly audited reporting.\"",

He's a controversial figure with a reputation for being something of an autocrat who has tended to gravitate towards a repertoire which may broadly be described as right-wing.</p> <p> On this occasion, however, he turned in some of the finest Strauss conducting heard in London for years. Effectively, he sees the score through the Marschallin's eyes: aware that time erodes beauty, love and sexual pleasure, she futilely tries to halt its progress by stopping the clock at night; Thielemann, similarly, seeks to stall the ceaseless flow of Strauss's music by lingering in vain over its elusive, slippery beauty.</p> <p> The effect is ravishing, but it's also relentless, tinged with desperation. The prelude has a clingy wildness, suggestive of frenetic, yet furtive sexual activity. The Marschallin's great monologue is accompanied by slithering dissonances which rob her of any sense of equanimity. Even in the pause before the great Trio - which Thielemann sustains for a terrifying 30 seconds or so - one has a shocking sense of the opera's impending, painful resolution. </p> <p>It's the finest thing Thielemann has ever done, and much the same can also be said of Ren\u00e9e Fleming's Marschallin. She's arrived back in London in a blaze of hype, and just for once the fuss is worth it. This is a very great account of the role. Strauss once commented that Octavian wasn't the Marschallin's first lover and won't be her last, all of which Fleming perfectly conveys with her remarkable presence and sexual allure. Yet she sheds new light on the Marschallin's predicament by revealing her as a loving woman who knows that she will never be genuinely loved in return. When she sends Octavian away at the end of act one, she's already aware she's lost him. </p> <p>Her final gesture is a brief abandonment of self-control as she pauses to embrace him one last hopeless time, her peerlessly beauti ful voice turning clotted and broken with pain. </p> <p>Susan Graham's Octavian approaches this phenomenal woman with a combination of explosive physicality and touching bewilderment until bashful gawkiness sets in when he finally meets Sophie. Graham is impressive, though one misses the character's sense of violent confusion. Christine Sch\u00e4fer's Sophie is a model of gauche, bourgeois restraint. Vocally she takes a while to settle, though in the final scene she's glorious. Franz Hawlata's Ochs is an ambivalent creature, young enough and handsome enough to be a provincial Don Juan, yet lacking a certain aristocratic dignity. These are minor flaws. The whole is a devastating experience which demands to be heard. You miss it at your peril. </p> <p>In rep until April 10 (0171-304 4000).</p>",

Attends, and hates,boarding school before moving to Westminster public school . Wins a scholarship to Cambridge , where he gains a first-class degree. Joins CND shortly afterwards, then the Royal Court as an assistant director. Marries Deirdre Hamilton-Hill in July 1962. They have two children. Joins the Workers Revolutionary Party in 1971. Leaves Deirdre in1974. In the 70s and 80s becomes political organiser for the WRP. Leaves in 1985 and founds Marxist Party . Marries Kika Markham in 1985. Two more children. Forms the Moving Theatre Company with Vanessa in 1993, with the aim of joining politics and art. </p> <p> It's easy to forget that Corin Redgrave is a hard-left revolutionary, with his soft voice, sensitive turn of phrase and shy manner. Yet he has served his time on the barricades. He spent almost 15 years in the Workers Revolutionary Party, years in which his first marriage collapsed and he stood as an MP and encouraged his sister Vanessa to join the organisation. The pair then broke away to found the Marxist Party. His political career ostensibly blighted a promising acting career: he has suggested that his connections with the WRP got him blacklisted at the BBC and may have lost him film and theatre roles. </p> <p>But Redgrave is a member of one of Britain's most celebrated acting dynasties, and that world would never be entirely closed to him. He never stopped acting, he says, never lost sight of it - although he was out of the limelight for the best years of a performer's life. And now the 60-year-old father of four is enjoying a belated popularity. A powerful performance in Noel Coward's Song at Twilight - which has just finished in London's West End - followed a spate of acclaimed stage and screen roles. Now he is about to play Macbeth. He seems unstoppable. </p> <p>Surely 60 is rather old to play Macbeth? \"Maybe it is something that audiences won't be comfortable with,\" he says, sipping lemon tea in a Soho cafe. And, he admits, the schedule makes no concessions. \"I am hurtling towards a production that has only four weeks rehearsal and three weeks playing. Shall we know anything about the play by the time we reach the end of that?\" But he does have one ace up his sleeve: he has played Lady Macbeth. He recalls how his father helped him to research that role, showing him what sort of eye movements to make during the sleepwalking scene. </p> <p>Life often comes crashing into art in Redgrave's world. Hugo Latymer, the character he has just been playing in Song at Twilight, is a repressed homosexual. After publishing his self-serving memoirs, Hugo is forced to confront his past by two women central to his life, a former lover (played by Redgrave's sister Vanessa), and his wife (played by his second wife, Kika Markham). \"He is so buttoned up about himself,\" he says, \"and is really intolerant. The play is about repression. And people who are repressed very often become the worst oppressors. It applies sadly,\" he continues, digressing almost by reflex into politics, \"to Kosovo in the way so many Kosovars have worked out their feelings of loss on the Roma people.\" </p> <p>While that may be true, there is a much more personal parallel to his performance. His father, Michael Redgrave, had gay relationships, one with the playwright Noel Coward, as he revealed to Corin with the words \"I think I ought to tell you, that I am, to say the least of it, bisexual\" before dissolving into tears. It was this declaration that inspired Corin to write the gentle biographical portrait Michael Redgrave, My Father, published in 1995. \"It was helpful to me to write it and is possibly helpful to other people in a similar situation,\" he says. \"It has to do with an apparent reversal of roles. A lot has been written of the problems which gay men have as sons telling their parents, but not a great deal has been written about the other direction.\" </p> <p>Discussing the parallels with Hugo Latymer, it is clear that he is enjoying acting again. But is there a sense of lost opportunity? \"There are parts that I haven't played and would have liked to have played, but I have no regrets at all. Absolutely none. Coming back to more full-time acting, full of other life experiences, perhaps has made me a better actor.\" </p> <p>Has ambition brought him to Macbeth? \"Ambition is not confined to the young,\" he says. \"The young are not counting days or months or even years to begin with. As they pass by, so you can afford to be laid back. Ambition is far more troubling when you look at the clock, because then you have to measure where you want to get to by the amount of time that you have to get there, and it becomes a much harsher thing. </p> <p>\"There is one advantage that a 60-year-old has over a 30-year-old in playing this part, and that is knowing what it is like for your way of life to be falling into the 'sear, the yellow leaf'. If you are honorable, loyal and tender towards the feelings of others you had better not be ambitious, because the two things will be in conflict.\" </p> <p>But ambition, in Redgrave's case, is seemingly selfless. \"In all areas I have ambitions that I have still to fulfil,\" he says, \"especially in politics, which is the area in which one's aims continually fall short.\" He cannot seem to separate his acting craft from political motivation. He begins to articulate the debt that art owes to multiculturalism and then becomes agitated when he thinks how it cannot grow or develop in \"the monocultural world that the Daily Mail imagines people want\". It's interesting that Redgrave singles out that paper for criticism, as it was the Mail that paid to serialise his book about his father. </p> <p>His political choler rises when he starts to talk about the lack of funding for theatre, and he suggests radical measures of protest - such as voluntarily closing all the theatres and kicking up an almighty fuss in the way that French lorry drivers do. \"Art and politics,\" he insists, \"can converge.\" </p> <p>Macbeth is at BAC, London SW11 (0171-223 2223) from March 24 to April 16.</p>",

It's interesting that Redgrave singles out that paper for criticism, as it was the Mail that paid to serialise his book about his father. His political choler rises when he starts to talk about the lack of funding for theatre, and he suggests radical measures of protest - such as voluntarily closing all the theatres and kicking up an almighty fuss in the way that French lorry drivers do. \"Art and politics,\" he insists, \"can converge.\" Macbeth is at BAC, London SW11 (0171-223 2223) from March 24 to April 16.",

But really there's no reason for reading them.\" Revising and remembering names of hospital departments is part of the job. \"There are a lot of -ologys - gynaecology, oncology, urology . . . It does require some concentration.\" \"There's nothing worse than doing a misfile. Our supervisor is great - if there is a misfile, he'll go through everything and, although it sounds crazy, he'll try to get us all to look at the misfiled number as if someone's read it wrong.\" If they can't find file 33, for instance, they will look under 83, or 88, reversing the numbers and checking against other pairs which are commonly confused. \"It is strange but you get used to certain numbers being misfiled and it's a method that usually works.\"",

      "body": "<p>How would you like private health insurance, a BMW, a personal parking space, free weekend hotel breaks and use of a Lear jet to fly down to the company flat in Monte Carlo? </p> <p>The days when the only perk you received was a box of Quality Street from the boss at Christmas are over for most secretaries and PAs, and while you'd be very lucky to be given all of the above, the quality of perks is streets ahead of what it once was. But two recent surveys, by recruitment specialists Select Appointments and Gordon Yates and the Guardian, reveal that not all perks are popular - both with employers and workers. </p> <p>This may well be because some are taxable benefits or perhaps they have limited appeal - not everyone wants to pump iron at lunchtime in a sweaty environment or head for a Henley hotel at the weekend when really they urgently need to visit Homebase. Some employees would argue that they'd rather have their salaries increased and be free to choose what they spend them on. </p> <p>Interestingly, what workers want and what management thinks they want can differ enormously. The Gordon Yates survey found that half the companies questioned offered private health insurance, while only 35% of employees found this the most attractive perk. </p> <p>According to Select Appointments, a year ago a third of companies used performance-related pay as part of their remuneration package, but this proportion has doubled. Staff pension schemes are also on the up, particularly for workers in the financial sector. But other job sectors have their pluses - if you work in publishing or printing, for instance, you'll almost certainly receive free tea and coffee. </p> <p>Before accepting a perk, say the experts, find out the tax implications. According to Paul Hodgson at independent researchers Income Data Services, \"If you're offered a company car, unless you're racking up high mileage which qualifies for tax discounts, it may not be worth your while.\" Accepting a cash allowance for a car may be more tax efficient than taking a company vehicle. Watch the forthcoming budget closely for any possible tax changes. </p> <p>The perks you receive are very much dictated by the job sector you work in - and generosity varies greatly. If you work in construction or engineering, you'll be very lucky to be offered a creche, whereas in local government or public services more than a quarter of workers have access to childcare facilities. </p> <p>Bob Wicks, managing director at Select, says: \"Many women, including young mothers and women returners, are specifically looking for flexible work, often part-time and temporary jobs. We would expect and encourage employers to invest in childcare provision to support parents in all these situations. Businesses that don't offer this benefit risk losing highly talented and committed staff.\" </p> <p>Rebecca Childs is a typical high-flying PA who enjoys a range of enviable perks from her company, a City broker. The 33-year-old works directly for the chief executive and says, \"I travel the world with my boss and it looks as if I'll be spending a couple of months in Australia on business this year. I also have a company credit card, which I can use for taking personnel out to dinner, but anything I spend has to be signed off! </p> <p>\"On top of that, I have a company mobile phone with all calls paid for, private health insurance and a variable annual bonus.\" So attractive is her bonus package that Childs says she prefers it to an increased salary. \"I doubt I would spend my own money on sensible things such as health insurance. But I think it's important to have them.\" Though she does concede that \"being able to travel the world and have a mobile phone makes me sound a bit like a Miss World contestant!\" </p> <p>As a London PA, Childs already stands a better chance of receiving good benefits. This is a simple case of supply and demand - because of the greater employment opportunities in London, the home counties and the south east, employers have to compete through offering higher salaries and benefits to attract the best staff. </p> <p>Some staff even see perks in a job that their employers don't notice. A spokeswoman for Gordon Yates said that one respondent \"considered the stunning view over London from her office as a perk, and another was attracted to work for a small firm because it was close to a watersports school and she could waterski at lunchtimes!\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "How would you like private health insurance, a BMW, a personal parking space, free weekend hotel breaks and use of a Lear jet to fly down to the company flat in Monte Carlo? The days when the only perk you received was a box of Quality Street from the boss at Christmas are over for most secretaries and PAs, and while you'd be very lucky to be given all of the above, the quality of perks is streets ahead of what it once was. But two recent surveys, by recruitment specialists Select Appointments and Gordon Yates and the Guardian, reveal that not all perks are popular - both with employers and workers. This may well be because some are taxable benefits or perhaps they have limited appeal - not everyone wants to pump iron at lunchtime in a sweaty environment or head for a Henley hotel at the weekend when really they urgently need to visit Homebase. Some employees would argue that they'd rather have their salaries increased and be free to choose what they spend them on. Interestingly, what workers want and what management thinks they want can differ enormously. The Gordon Yates survey found that half the companies questioned offered private health insurance, while only 35% of employees found this the most attractive perk. According to Select Appointments, a year ago a third of companies used performance-related pay as part of their remuneration package, but this proportion has doubled. Staff pension schemes are also on the up, particularly for workers in the financial sector. But other job sectors have their pluses - if you work in publishing or printing, for instance, you'll almost certainly receive free tea and coffee. Before accepting a perk, say the experts, find out the tax implications. According to Paul Hodgson at independent researchers Income Data Services, \"If you're offered a company car, unless you're racking up high mileage which qualifies for tax discounts, it may not be worth your while.\" Accepting a cash allowance for a car may be more tax efficient than taking a company vehicle. Watch the forthcoming budget closely for any possible tax changes. The perks you receive are very much dictated by the job sector you work in - and generosity varies greatly. If you work in construction or engineering, you'll be very lucky to be offered a creche, whereas in local government or public services more than a quarter of workers have access to childcare facilities. Bob Wicks, managing director at Select, says: \"Many women, including young mothers and women returners, are specifically looking for flexible work, often part-time and temporary jobs. We would expect and encourage employers to invest in childcare provision to support parents in all these situations. Businesses that don't offer this benefit risk losing highly talented and committed staff.\" Rebecca Childs is a typical high-flying PA who enjoys a range of enviable perks from her company, a City broker. The 33-year-old works directly for the chief executive and says, \"I travel the world with my boss and it looks as if I'll be spending a couple of months in Australia on business this year. I also have a company credit card, which I can use for taking personnel out to dinner, but anything I spend has to be signed off! \"On top of that, I have a company mobile phone with all calls paid for, private health insurance and a variable annual bonus.\" So attractive is her bonus package that Childs says she prefers it to an increased salary. \"I doubt I would spend my own money on sensible things such as health insurance. But I think it's important to have them.\" Though she does concede that \"being able to travel the world and have a mobile phone makes me sound a bit like a Miss World contestant!\" As a London PA, Childs already stands a better chance of receiving good benefits. This is a simple case of supply and demand - because of the greater employment opportunities in London, the home counties and the south east, employers have to compete through offering higher salaries and benefits to attract the best staff. Some staff even see perks in a job that their employers don't notice. A spokeswoman for Gordon Yates said that one respondent \"considered the stunning view over London from her office as a perk, and another was attracted to work for a small firm because it was close to a watersports school and she could waterski at lunchtimes!\"",
