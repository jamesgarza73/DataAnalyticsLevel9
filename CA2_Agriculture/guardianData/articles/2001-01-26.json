      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Another week in sunny Sarawak, this beautiful unspoilt area. My last afternoon in Kuching we rode out to a village with a longhouse. These are tribal, communal buildings built mostly of bamboo on stilts with living areas subdivided for families but the veranda, kitchen, store houses etc shared. This one was almost a village on stilts with 'streets' going off it. It was much more ramshackle than the small neat examples at the cultural village. There was now electricity, and you could glimpse the odd TV, but the water was still collected from the river beside. Some living areas were padlocked and an old woman making baskets said that many families had moved to the towns. I always feel somewhat uncomfortable on these occasions, the 'rich' tourist come to gawp at their way of life, but it was fascinating to see nonetheless.</p> <p>So Saturday off to Sibu by bus, a long bumpy journey. Sibu is a busy port, the last place linking the China sea with the Batang Rejang river. Again I had arrived on the day that the huge pagoda temple, with magnificent views from the top, was closed. I spent the day wandering around the fascinating street markets. I confess to having problems with meals. There is an abundance of eating places but they do not have menus and they make the dishes up as they are asked for - difficult when you haven't a clue what anything is called and also have a dread of ending up with seafood of a 'slimy' nature. The market stalls are OK as you can point to things, but you then there's nowhere to eat it in the busy throng. I refuse to resort to the KFCs which are everywhere, and usually end up with noodles and something or other but never the same thing twice.</p> <p>Next day another bus to Miri, an oil town that is the jumping off point for the Mulu National Park. On both buses I had been the only non-Malaysian. The buses stop every so often but nobody seemed able to tell me for how long so I hardly dared move away. When the drivers were ready it was one loud blast of the horn and away. No such thing as a head count. On the Miri bus I was sitting next to a Malaysian girl. We didn't talk, but I offered her one of my mangy biscuits which she refused. At the next stop when we got back on she had bought me some chopped local fruit and a bunch of rambutan, red horse chestnut-like things with a delicious lychee-like fruit inside. She had to show me how to open them, which is a two-handed twist around the middle. I was very touched by this act of kindness. </p> <p>On the subject of fruit I had, in Kuching, sampled the local 'king of the fruits' durian, a huge very prickly thing the size and weight of a medicine ball, much revered and loved in Malaysia. It opened into segments of white gooey stuff like ice cream mixed with marshmallow which you scooped out and sort of sucked up. I had been warned it had a very strong smell but didn't expect it to taste as bad as it smelt and to linger with you for days to come. I will give this one a miss in future. Sorry. All other fruits are lovely and the selection makes Sainsbury's shelves seem boring and bare.</p> <p>I had been emailed by Jeremy and Gay, who live in Miri. They collected me from my hotel and took me out for a meal and back to their bungalow for coffee and a quick read of my email. I love this interactive travelling - people are so kind. They have even offered me the use of their washing machine when I return from the park - an offer they may regret when I open my bag! I had a shock in their car when on the radio I heard Capital Radio! Apparently it was the favourite station of one of the Brunei royal family when in England so he had it beamed out to Brunei, just across the border from Miri.</p> <p>Time for my second national park, Mulu. This park can only be reached by plane, so it was another new experience flying in a twin-engine Otter below the clouds with a wonderful view of the ground below. A few patches of land totally denuded by logging were a reminder of the conflicting demands on this land, rich in natural resources but with an economy devastated by the Asian financial crisis of a few years ago.</p> <p>I had decided to forgo the extremely expensive travel agency tours, with prearranged trips and guides and play it by ear when I arrived. A very wise decision as it turned out as guides are totally unnecessary and the system of permits a lottery. This was my first real taste of hostel living - a different experience from the cheap hotels I had opted for so far. What you lose in privacy is gained in mixing easily with other travellers. In the three days I was there, two Canadians, two Americans, a Slovakian, two Swedes, a German and an assortment of English came and went, all (with one exception)very friendly and good fun.</p> <p>That first night I had left a plastic bag of odds and ends of food beside my bed and was woken by loud rustling sounds from the bag. I froze but decided there was no way I could get back to sleep with my imagination running riot - cockroach? lizard? monkey? deadly snake? - the creatures were growing bigger by the second. Finding my torch I grabbed the bag, still rustling, flung it in the kitchen and closed the door. When I dared to look next morning what ever it was had long gone so I will never know.</p> <p>Mulu park has the largest limestone cave system in the world. There are four show caves. Wednesday I set off for the Deer and Lang caves. With what appears to be becoming my usual timing I picked the day the generator broke down so the caves were not lit. Deer cave is huge, home to millions of bats. The towering walls and rock formations are all covered with a layer of guano. You had to be careful not to gape too much at the magnitude of the cave as the smell of ammonia was very powerful, or to not slip on the fine layer of droppings on the walkway. There was quite a lot of natural light here, but when I saw the pitch black entrance to Lang cave I decided my little torch was not up to the job. I sat on a rock and waited for someone else to arrive. First along were a group of about 10 young Malaysians sporting a good array of torches and flashlights. I showed them my torch and they immediately agreed I would be better off with them. In the cave the weird and beautiful rocks, stalagmites and stalactites were amazing. At times there was an Escher-like impossibility to their twists and turns.</p> <p>I then parked myself at the bat observatory to await the nightly exit of the Two million or so bats from Deer cave, usually about 5.30, and was gradually joined by about 20 other people. By 6.45, no sign of a bat, it was getting dark and most people had gone. Five of us were determined to stick it out and were rewarded after 7pm by a couple of short strings and a doughnut or two of bats emerging. Whether they had missed their afternoon fix of electric light, or the rare lack of rain for two days upset them, or they knew that I had waited three hours with camera at the ready, I do not know. But whatever the reason, tonight was definitely not the night! That meant that the 45 minute walk back with a couple from KL had to be done by the light of my little torch. I also had the embarrassment of slipping on some wet leaves and landing heavily on my backside.</p> <p>The next day most of the hostel were setting off for the three-day trek to the pinnacles. I had decided against this when a couple of the very fit young men said it was hard! That left me and superfit Canadian Dave, the postman who jogs his round. I asked if he minded if Sue, the not very fit netjetter, joined him on the 4km walk to the other caves. He gallantly said not at all. Wind Cave was another impressive display of nature being artistic in stone.</p> <p>Clearwater Cave is 51km long with a stream going through it. At the end of the walkway, a few 100m in, I left Dave the jogging postman forging on into the unlit depths of the cave following the stream. I decided if he had not returned by midnight I would alert the authorities. A few ringits to a boatman saw me hitching a boat ride back, joining a rather bewildered family on their way back to the posh hotel further down the river from the park.(Dave did eventually return many hours later.)</p> <p>That afternoon a few of us were invited to have coffee on the veranda of the house of one of the local Berawan tribe. We were told the story of the tribe's struggle to save their traditional lands from the loggers and developers. They had reluctantly agreed to have an area of their land declared the national park - Mulu, but then 20 acres more were 'sold' to developers with government and Japanese connections, for a pittance and the Royal Mulu Resort (the posh hotel) was built. </p> <p>Since the early 1990s they have been trying to acquire another 250 acres to build a golf course. This and the extension of the tiny airport would involve the demolition of two huge limestone hills. The Berawan have resisted through the courts, saying this is Native Customary Rights land, and through a peaceful demonstration, where four were arrested. An arson attack on the parks generators also led to more arrests and alleged beatings. The dispute rumbles on in the courts, but we were shown the heavy machinery already active at the base of one of the hills. The locals try to enlist support from foreign visitors to the park. Unfortunately for them, the people who stay in the park - although the last people to want golf courses and monorails - are mostly backpackers, the people with money and clout stay in the Resort.

      "bodyText": "Another week in sunny Sarawak, this beautiful unspoilt area. My last afternoon in Kuching we rode out to a village with a longhouse. These are tribal, communal buildings built mostly of bamboo on stilts with living areas subdivided for families but the veranda, kitchen, store houses etc shared. This one was almost a village on stilts with 'streets' going off it. It was much more ramshackle than the small neat examples at the cultural village. There was now electricity, and you could glimpse the odd TV, but the water was still collected from the river beside. Some living areas were padlocked and an old woman making baskets said that many families had moved to the towns. I always feel somewhat uncomfortable on these occasions, the 'rich' tourist come to gawp at their way of life, but it was fascinating to see nonetheless. So Saturday off to Sibu by bus, a long bumpy journey. Sibu is a busy port, the last place linking the China sea with the Batang Rejang river. Again I had arrived on the day that the huge pagoda temple, with magnificent views from the top, was closed. I spent the day wandering around the fascinating street markets. I confess to having problems with meals. There is an abundance of eating places but they do not have menus and they make the dishes up as they are asked for - difficult when you haven't a clue what anything is called and also have a dread of ending up with seafood of a 'slimy' nature. The market stalls are OK as you can point to things, but you then there's nowhere to eat it in the busy throng. I refuse to resort to the KFCs which are everywhere, and usually end up with noodles and something or other but never the same thing twice. Next day another bus to Miri, an oil town that is the jumping off point for the Mulu National Park. On both buses I had been the only non-Malaysian. The buses stop every so often but nobody seemed able to tell me for how long so I hardly dared move away. When the drivers were ready it was one loud blast of the horn and away. No such thing as a head count. On the Miri bus I was sitting next to a Malaysian girl. We didn't talk, but I offered her one of my mangy biscuits which she refused. At the next stop when we got back on she had bought me some chopped local fruit and a bunch of rambutan, red horse chestnut-like things with a delicious lychee-like fruit inside. She had to show me how to open them, which is a two-handed twist around the middle. I was very touched by this act of kindness. On the subject of fruit I had, in Kuching, sampled the local 'king of the fruits' durian, a huge very prickly thing the size and weight of a medicine ball, much revered and loved in Malaysia. It opened into segments of white gooey stuff like ice cream mixed with marshmallow which you scooped out and sort of sucked up. I had been warned it had a very strong smell but didn't expect it to taste as bad as it smelt and to linger with you for days to come. I will give this one a miss in future. Sorry. All other fruits are lovely and the selection makes Sainsbury's shelves seem boring and bare. I had been emailed by Jeremy and Gay, who live in Miri. They collected me from my hotel and took me out for a meal and back to their bungalow for coffee and a quick read of my email. I love this interactive travelling - people are so kind. They have even offered me the use of their washing machine when I return from the park - an offer they may regret when I open my bag! I had a shock in their car when on the radio I heard Capital Radio! Apparently it was the favourite station of one of the Brunei royal family when in England so he had it beamed out to Brunei, just across the border from Miri. Time for my second national park, Mulu. This park can only be reached by plane, so it was another new experience flying in a twin-engine Otter below the clouds with a wonderful view of the ground below. A few patches of land totally denuded by logging were a reminder of the conflicting demands on this land, rich in natural resources but with an economy devastated by the Asian financial crisis of a few years ago. I had decided to forgo the extremely expensive travel agency tours, with prearranged trips and guides and play it by ear when I arrived. A very wise decision as it turned out as guides are totally unnecessary and the system of permits a lottery. This was my first real taste of hostel living - a different experience from the cheap hotels I had opted for so far. What you lose in privacy is gained in mixing easily with other travellers. In the three days I was there, two Canadians, two Americans, a Slovakian, two Swedes, a German and an assortment of English came and went, all (with one exception)very friendly and good fun. That first night I had left a plastic bag of odds and ends of food beside my bed and was woken by loud rustling sounds from the bag. I froze but decided there was no way I could get back to sleep with my imagination running riot - cockroach? lizard? monkey? deadly snake? - the creatures were growing bigger by the second. Finding my torch I grabbed the bag, still rustling, flung it in the kitchen and closed the door. When I dared to look next morning what ever it was had long gone so I will never know. Mulu park has the largest limestone cave system in the world. There are four show caves. Wednesday I set off for the Deer and Lang caves. With what appears to be becoming my usual timing I picked the day the generator broke down so the caves were not lit. Deer cave is huge, home to millions of bats. The towering walls and rock formations are all covered with a layer of guano. You had to be careful not to gape too much at the magnitude of the cave as the smell of ammonia was very powerful, or to not slip on the fine layer of droppings on the walkway. There was quite a lot of natural light here, but when I saw the pitch black entrance to Lang cave I decided my little torch was not up to the job. I sat on a rock and waited for someone else to arrive. First along were a group of about 10 young Malaysians sporting a good array of torches and flashlights. I showed them my torch and they immediately agreed I would be better off with them. In the cave the weird and beautiful rocks, stalagmites and stalactites were amazing. At times there was an Escher-like impossibility to their twists and turns. I then parked myself at the bat observatory to await the nightly exit of the Two million or so bats from Deer cave, usually about 5.30, and was gradually joined by about 20 other people. By 6.45, no sign of a bat, it was getting dark and most people had gone. Five of us were determined to stick it out and were rewarded after 7pm by a couple of short strings and a doughnut or two of bats emerging. Whether they had missed their afternoon fix of electric light, or the rare lack of rain for two days upset them, or they knew that I had waited three hours with camera at the ready, I do not know. But whatever the reason, tonight was definitely not the night! That meant that the 45 minute walk back with a couple from KL had to be done by the light of my little torch. I also had the embarrassment of slipping on some wet leaves and landing heavily on my backside. The next day most of the hostel were setting off for the three-day trek to the pinnacles. I had decided against this when a couple of the very fit young men said it was hard! That left me and superfit Canadian Dave, the postman who jogs his round. I asked if he minded if Sue, the not very fit netjetter, joined him on the 4km walk to the other caves. He gallantly said not at all. Wind Cave was another impressive display of nature being artistic in stone. Clearwater Cave is 51km long with a stream going through it. At the end of the walkway, a few 100m in, I left Dave the jogging postman forging on into the unlit depths of the cave following the stream. I decided if he had not returned by midnight I would alert the authorities. A few ringits to a boatman saw me hitching a boat ride back, joining a rather bewildered family on their way back to the posh hotel further down the river from the park.(Dave did eventually return many hours later.) That afternoon a few of us were invited to have coffee on the veranda of the house of one of the local Berawan tribe. We were told the story of the tribe's struggle to save their traditional lands from the loggers and developers. They had reluctantly agreed to have an area of their land declared the national park - Mulu, but then 20 acres more were 'sold' to developers with government and Japanese connections, for a pittance and the Royal Mulu Resort (the posh hotel) was built. Since the early 1990s they have been trying to acquire another 250 acres to build a golf course. This and the extension of the tiny airport would involve the demolition of two huge limestone hills. The Berawan have resisted through the courts, saying this is Native Customary Rights land, and through a peaceful demonstration, where four were arrested. An arson attack on the parks generators also led to more arrests and alleged beatings. The dispute rumbles on in the courts, but we were shown the heavy machinery already active at the base of one of the hills. The locals try to enlist support from foreign visitors to the park. Unfortunately for them, the people who stay in the park - although the last people to want golf courses and monorails - are mostly backpackers, the people with money and clout stay in the Resort. It is a story repeated at many levels all over the world. I personally hope the Berawan retain their rights to decide the future of their land, but history and the way the modern world works are heavily against them. I consider myself fortunate to travel here now, what will 10 years bring? I enjoyed Mulu very much but the only trails were to the caves and the Pinnacles. I would have enjoyed other half day walks if they had been available. Last week I changed my tickets and extended my stay in Sarawak a few more days rather than rush everything. I'm off to the Niah national park on Sunday and then on to Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. Can one become addicted to rainforests? I wonder how the peninsular will compare to Sarawak? I'll let you know over the next couple of weeks. May I just wish my friend Philip a speedy recovery from his op? I tend to think of England as in suspended animation while I am away.

They do it out of the kindness of their heart, not for a political agenda. They do this to make friends.\"</p> <p><b> Dinner</b><br></p> <p>The brothers are known by friends by their initials, SP and GP. Businessman GK Noon, a Labour party member, also attended: \"SP Hinduja made a speech welcoming Mr Hague. Well, if you invite someone for dinner, you have to praise them. The room was absolutely full, it was a lavish function.\"</p> <p>Mr Noon added: \"Mr Hague has enjoyed their hospitality. Having enjoyed himself the hospitality of the Hindujas, was there any rationale in attacking the way he did on Wednesday?\"</p> <p>A Tory insider present at the function said: \"People were saying, why haven't they hosted it on their own? They did not want to identify themselves exclusively with the Tory party. It was them playing both sides, covering their options in case we got back in.\"</p> <p>Last night a Conservative party spokesman, asked about the Hindujas' function in Hague's honour first replied: \"Since William became leader in 1997, the Hindujas have not made any donations to the party.\" Pressed for an answer to the question actually asked, the spokesman said: \"We're not in a position to deny or confirm that the Hindujas held functions in William Hague's honour.\"</p> <p>The Tory insider remembered another example of the Hindujas' largesse to the party. When Margaret Thatcher was still prime minister the brothers attended a party ball: \"A bottle of House of Commons whisky autographed by Margaret Thatcher was autioned off. They paid \u00a325,000. They are teetotal and they returned it. Some saw this as being smug.\"</p> <p>Details of the Hague bash emerged as panic gripped Whitehall last night as ministers and MPs trawled diaries and papers to clarify details of conversations and meetings with the billionaire brothers following Peter Mandelson's spectacular resignation after misleading Tony Blair about his interventions with the Home Office on behalf of SP. \"We are getting some traffic with other departments. It is not the kind of stuff you can do in a couple of hours,\" said a senior civil servant.</p> <p>The tentacles of the Hindujas have touched prominent figures in all the main parties, the brothers appearing to hedge their bets by consorting with Labour, Tory and Liberal Democrat politicians. About a dozen candidates at the last election, Labour and Tory, are rumoured at Westminster to have received donations from the brothers who are facing possible corruption charges in India over an arms scandal.</p> <p>The minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, will be grilled by former Treasury solicitor Sir Anthony Hammond QC after he was named in the parliamentary written answer that triggered Mr Mandelson's downfall. Mr Vaz, Britain's most high-profile Asian politician, made \"inquiries\" about an application by SP and the Home Office refused to divulge details until the inquiry report is published later this year.</p> <p>Mr Vaz yesterday would not answer detailed questions, but one report claimed he sent letters drafted by the Hindujas for his signature to Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson in October 1997. Last night a government department also said they believed that the Hindujas had staged a party when Mr Vaz became Europe minister at the Foreign Office.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's department said, after checking Lord Irvine's diary: \"The lord chancellor attended a function at New Zealand House on September 22 which we believe was hosted by the Hindujas to mark the appointment of the first British Asian minister of state in recent times, Keith Vaz.\"</p> <p>Mr Vaz faces problems on a second front with Elizabeth Filkin, parliamentary commissioner for standards, expected to raise concerns that individuals who gave evidence to an inquiry into the minister received letters from the local Labour party challenging them to put up or shut up.</p> <p>The minister strongly denies allegations from businessmen that he accepted money in exchange for exerting influence in a planning case in Leicester where he is an MP. Mr Vaz is said be a regular visitor to the 14th floor of New Zealand House, and one source said he is obsequious in the presence of SP and GP. Tony and a sari-clad Cherie Blair have attended a Diwali party hosted by the brothers in Alexandra Palace, north London. One picture of the event showed an anxious Mandelson hovering in the background.</p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, found himself drawn into the Hinduja affair last night when it emerged he has held a series of meeting with the brothers. Sources close to the minister confirmed he met the brothers at his office to discuss a multi-million pound joint project they are funding in India with Powergen.</p> <p><b>Fear</b><br></p> <p>\"Stephen met the brothers to discuss the project at the department,\" the source said. \"He also met them at a reception hosted by the brothers attended by 200 other people. All their discussions were about trade.\"</p> <p>In a sign of the fear gripping Whitehall in the wake of Mr Mandelson's resignation, Mr Byers instructed officials to search hundreds of files to check exact details of contacts between his ministers and the brothers.</p> <p>Sir Edward Heath, who acted as a referee on GP Hinduja's passport application form, ordered his staff to check his private papers to discover whether he has ever received money from the brothers.</p> <p>Sir Edward has known the Hindujas for more than 20 years and recently served as a trustee of an academic institute at Cambridge founded by the brothers in memory of SP's only son, Dharam, who set fire to himself and his wife, an Anglo-Indian Catholic, in 1992. His death is a highly sensitive matter for SP after a coroner's report said that the family had objected to them living together.</p> <p>Sir Edward also served as a trustee of the Dharam Hinduja Institute of Indic Research which carries out work on the Vedas, the most ancient of India's sacred texts.</p> <p>A spokesman for the former prime minister said he did not believe that Sir Edward had received payments from the Hinduja brothers. \"We have received odd presents of fruit but we will have to check if there was anything else,\" he said.</p> <p>The Hinduja brothers did not limit their generosity to the two main parties. At least one of the brothers regularly attends the annual Liberal Democrat ball at the Dorchester hotel where tables cost thousands of pounds. Lord Razzall, the party's treasurer who is a close aide to the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy, said last night: \"I have seen one or more of the Hinduja brothers at our annual balls. But they have not made any donations to the party.\"</p> <p>\"They put themselves about,\" said a party official. Sir Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dems' former leader, met them \"several times\" at functions. But Sir Paddy insisted yesterday he did not call, write or lobby any civil servants or ministers about a passport for either of the brothers.</p> <p>In the City, the secrecy surrounding the Hindujas' business affairs is increasingly the subject of speculation.Their battle to become British citizens appears to date from the first signs of trouble in India over allegations centring on \u00a330m of kickbacks allegedly paid out by the Swedish arms firm Bofors to secure a \u00a3775m deal to provide howitzer guns to the Indian army in 1986. On January 22 1990 GP was named as a suspect in a report by police at India's central bureau of investigation.</p> <p>Less than a month later, on February 21, both SP and GP applied for British naturalisation. The applications were turned down the following April. Both the brothers' spokesman and Home Office sources now say SP was turned down on residency grounds.</p> <p>But no explanation has been given for the refusal of GP's application. Since 1983 the brothers have attracted controversy. One India expert who has followed their career in detail said: \"It is unimaginable that MI6 and the Foreign Office would not have drawers of files on them.\"</p> <p>Did GP seek his passport because of the storm brewing over Bofors? Is it coincidence that in 1991 an Indian CBI investigator arrived in London to make inquiries in connection with the controversy?</p> <p>On March 5 1997 GP applied again. The naturalisation certificate was granted on November 4 1997. The speed with which the application went through was described as one expert as \"remarkably quick\".</p> <p>SP then applied again on October 20 1998, gaining naturalisation on March 23 1999 - again a very speedy result.</p>",

Some saw this as being smug.\" Details of the Hague bash emerged as panic gripped Whitehall last night as ministers and MPs trawled diaries and papers to clarify details of conversations and meetings with the billionaire brothers following Peter Mandelson's spectacular resignation after misleading Tony Blair about his interventions with the Home Office on behalf of SP. \"We are getting some traffic with other departments. It is not the kind of stuff you can do in a couple of hours,\" said a senior civil servant. The tentacles of the Hindujas have touched prominent figures in all the main parties, the brothers appearing to hedge their bets by consorting with Labour, Tory and Liberal Democrat politicians. About a dozen candidates at the last election, Labour and Tory, are rumoured at Westminster to have received donations from the brothers who are facing possible corruption charges in India over an arms scandal. The minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, will be grilled by former Treasury solicitor Sir Anthony Hammond QC after he was named in the parliamentary written answer that triggered Mr Mandelson's downfall. Mr Vaz, Britain's most high-profile Asian politician, made \"inquiries\" about an application by SP and the Home Office refused to divulge details until the inquiry report is published later this year. Mr Vaz yesterday would not answer detailed questions, but one report claimed he sent letters drafted by the Hindujas for his signature to Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson in October 1997. Last night a government department also said they believed that the Hindujas had staged a party when Mr Vaz became Europe minister at the Foreign Office. A spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's department said, after checking Lord Irvine's diary: \"The lord chancellor attended a function at New Zealand House on September 22 which we believe was hosted by the Hindujas to mark the appointment of the first British Asian minister of state in recent times, Keith Vaz.\" Mr Vaz faces problems on a second front with Elizabeth Filkin, parliamentary commissioner for standards, expected to raise concerns that individuals who gave evidence to an inquiry into the minister received letters from the local Labour party challenging them to put up or shut up. The minister strongly denies allegations from businessmen that he accepted money in exchange for exerting influence in a planning case in Leicester where he is an MP. Mr Vaz is said be a regular visitor to the 14th floor of New Zealand House, and one source said he is obsequious in the presence of SP and GP. Tony and a sari-clad Cherie Blair have attended a Diwali party hosted by the brothers in Alexandra Palace, north London. One picture of the event showed an anxious Mandelson hovering in the background. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, found himself drawn into the Hinduja affair last night when it emerged he has held a series of meeting with the brothers. Sources close to the minister confirmed he met the brothers at his office to discuss a multi-million pound joint project they are funding in India with Powergen. Fear \"Stephen met the brothers to discuss the project at the department,\" the source said. \"He also met them at a reception hosted by the brothers attended by 200 other people. All their discussions were about trade.\" In a sign of the fear gripping Whitehall in the wake of Mr Mandelson's resignation, Mr Byers instructed officials to search hundreds of files to check exact details of contacts between his ministers and the brothers. Sir Edward Heath, who acted as a referee on GP Hinduja's passport application form, ordered his staff to check his private papers to discover whether he has ever received money from the brothers. Sir Edward has known the Hindujas for more than 20 years and recently served as a trustee of an academic institute at Cambridge founded by the brothers in memory of SP's only son, Dharam, who set fire to himself and his wife, an Anglo-Indian Catholic, in 1992. His death is a highly sensitive matter for SP after a coroner's report said that the family had objected to them living together. Sir Edward also served as a trustee of the Dharam Hinduja Institute of Indic Research which carries out work on the Vedas, the most ancient of India's sacred texts. A spokesman for the former prime minister said he did not believe that Sir Edward had received payments from the Hinduja brothers. \"We have received odd presents of fruit but we will have to check if there was anything else,\" he said. The Hinduja brothers did not limit their generosity to the two main parties. At least one of the brothers regularly attends the annual Liberal Democrat ball at the Dorchester hotel where tables cost thousands of pounds. Lord Razzall, the party's treasurer who is a close aide to the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy, said last night: \"I have seen one or more of the Hinduja brothers at our annual balls. But they have not made any donations to the party.\" \"They put themselves about,\" said a party official. Sir Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dems' former leader, met them \"several times\" at functions. But Sir Paddy insisted yesterday he did not call, write or lobby any civil servants or ministers about a passport for either of the brothers. In the City, the secrecy surrounding the Hindujas' business affairs is increasingly the subject of speculation.Their battle to become British citizens appears to date from the first signs of trouble in India over allegations centring on \u00a330m of kickbacks allegedly paid out by the Swedish arms firm Bofors to secure a \u00a3775m deal to provide howitzer guns to the Indian army in 1986. On January 22 1990 GP was named as a suspect in a report by police at India's central bureau of investigation. Less than a month later, on February 21, both SP and GP applied for British naturalisation. The applications were turned down the following April. Both the brothers' spokesman and Home Office sources now say SP was turned down on residency grounds. But no explanation has been given for the refusal of GP's application. Since 1983 the brothers have attracted controversy. One India expert who has followed their career in detail said: \"It is unimaginable that MI6 and the Foreign Office would not have drawers of files on them.\" Did GP seek his passport because of the storm brewing over Bofors? Is it coincidence that in 1991 an Indian CBI investigator arrived in London to make inquiries in connection with the controversy? On March 5 1997 GP applied again. The naturalisation certificate was granted on November 4 1997. The speed with which the application went through was described as one expert as \"remarkably quick\". SP then applied again on October 20 1998, gaining naturalisation on March 23 1999 - again a very speedy result.",

      "body": "<p>At least they had something to talk about as they waited for the late-running Dior show to start on Monday. Not only who was going to take over at Givenchy (fashion-land is still getting used to the idea of surprise front-runner Olivier Theyskens), but what were McQueen's clothes actually like? After LVMH pulled the plug on the Givenchy show for \"production problems\", the house showed to an audience of 60 specially selected clients - ie no press. </p> <p>There were varied reports of the 30-odd outfits. McQueen's overall theme was apparently Africa and the collection included an \"unbelievably beautiful\" but \"unwearable\" asymmetric gown in perforated snakeskin, held together by rings of tortoiseshell. McQueen was present, but witnesses saw him jump in a taxi minutes after the show. He is still supposed to be showing Givenchy ready-to-wear in six weeks' time - anyone want to place bets on when that show's cancelled? </p> <p>Then there were the week's other top stories to discuss, about the take-over plans at Gucci. If you believe the rumours, Tom Ford and Domenico de Sole have been busy - they are said to be close to signing up hot labels Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta.

      "bodyText": "At least they had something to talk about as they waited for the late-running Dior show to start on Monday. Not only who was going to take over at Givenchy (fashion-land is still getting used to the idea of surprise front-runner Olivier Theyskens), but what were McQueen's clothes actually like? After LVMH pulled the plug on the Givenchy show for \"production problems\", the house showed to an audience of 60 specially selected clients - ie no press. There were varied reports of the 30-odd outfits. McQueen's overall theme was apparently Africa and the collection included an \"unbelievably beautiful\" but \"unwearable\" asymmetric gown in perforated snakeskin, held together by rings of tortoiseshell. McQueen was present, but witnesses saw him jump in a taxi minutes after the show. He is still supposed to be showing Givenchy ready-to-wear in six weeks' time - anyone want to place bets on when that show's cancelled? Then there were the week's other top stories to discuss, about the take-over plans at Gucci. If you believe the rumours, Tom Ford and Domenico de Sole have been busy - they are said to be close to signing up hot labels Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta. Sources say the deals would be similar to the one they've made with McQueen, giving the designers (Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re and Giles Deacon) creative freedom and strong financial support. When the Dior show started, the gossip wasn't over. In a week low on celebrities (the A-list were in Hollywood for the Golden Globes), Dior had bagged the most.

      "bodyText": "Gay website Queercompany.com is to auction off the huge \"Lesbian Kiss\" ad hoarding that created such a storm last month. Queercompany said it would frame the image from the ad hoarding at Centrepoint in the West End, sell it off to the highest bidder and split the proceeds between gay campaigning group Stonewall and \"queer arts projects\". The number of potential bidders will be limited however by its size - 90x10m. Today the company splashed a \"For Sale\" strip across the billboard, which shows two women kissing on a bed and the strapline \"Thank God for Women\". \"This is a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind memento of the breaking of a major barrier in the depiction of lesbian and gay lives in our society,\" said Dominic Richards, CEO of Queercompany. The ad campaign, created by agency Anti Corp, is running on 11 billboards at major junctions in London. Other executions showed two semi-naked men embracing with the strapline, \"Thank God for Men\". Despite 50 complaints from members of the public - who complained it promoted homosexuality to children - and outrage from some tabloid newspapers, the Advertising Standards Authority cleared the campaign on January 12. The ASA ruled that it was not sexually explicit and was unlikely to affect children. \"We have been amazed by the response to our poster and we're delighted that in the space of a month it has become a cultural icon, appearing in newspapers and magazines around the world,\" added Mr Richards. He said Queercompany has been inundated with emails praising the ads and the uncompromising stance that they take. The site has also received pleas for posters and T-shirts bearing the images.

Pushing open the glass doors to the deserted catwalk area, I learnt my first valuable lesson, that fashion is never on time. </p> <p>Watching the couture customers, fashion editors and celebs arrive was as interesting as the show itself.

The photographers began pushing each other in earnest as Lil' Kim and Pamela Anderson appeared. According to the show notes on my seat, Donatella has decreed that shoulders are altars, but here they were being used in a most ungodly way. </p> <p>As the techno music became so loud that my already vibrating seat was ready to spring into another galaxy, the show started. The clothes were stunning. My favourite was a green shimmery micro-mini - perfect, I thought, for going down the pub in on a Saturday night. </p> <p>At 25 minutes, the show was much shorter than I had expected and the applause at the end was muted, which surprised me as I'd assumed there would be standing ovations, flowers thrown and cries of \"Bravo!\" Even when Donatella appeared, the reception was hardly enthusiastic. </p> <p>Later in the week, John Galliano produced a collection for Dior so brilliant that I wanted to start a mexican wave, but still the clapping was half-hearted. Yet at the Morteza Pashai show, which had all the atmosphere of a school assembly, with clothes that would not have looked out of place at M&amp;S, the reception was thunderous. </p> <p>The Dominique Sirop show was chaotic, with models parading around on the balcony as everyone spilled free champagne over each other in the race to get the best view. One gorgeous dress, of sheer black and gold material, had the model naked underneath - and as his wife nattered on to him, one lecherous man made it clear his mind and other parts of his anatomy were elsewhere. </p> <p>At Emanuel Ungaro's show, the models walked around in groups, chatting. It looked rather contrived and one girl forgot where she was and gave her poor arm a good scratch. But the superb fuchsias, oranges and turquoises added vibrancy to a dull morning. At every show, there was one outfit that made me want to shout: \"Mine! Give it here!\" In this case it was a pale pink suit with silver threads. </p> <p>The show I enjoyed most was Dior. I knew it would be fun as soon as a tiny old woman near me, with incredibly short, blue-tinted hair, began clicking her diamant\u00e9 cowboy boots in time to the Knight Rider tune being played. Dior had distinct themes, ranging from a dramatic cavewoman wearing gold silk to the idealised 1950s woman. He even managed to make plastic rain-hats and cocktail glass-print dresses look chic. </p> <p>At the Louis F\u00e9raud and Hanae Mori shows, the clothes took a back seat. At Mori, I was distracted by one couture customer saying to another: \"I love your jacket. Of course my husband gave me a dressier version for my birthday, which we spent at our third home in Morocco.\" The man who showed me to my seat was so fantastically good-looking that concentrating was difficult, but even to my naive eye the clothes were perfectly tailored, though more to my mother's taste than mine. </p> <p>At F\u00e9raud, the very late start gave everyone ample opportunity to knock back the Mo\u00ebt. As a result, the normally sedate front row shouted out increasingly slurred commands - \"Stop, turn around!\" - to the startled models. </p> <p>The Yves Saint Laurent show was a fitting end to my first couture collections. The clothes were very beautiful, very 1950s French Riviera. Much less flesh was on view than normal, which was great because after days bloating out on chocolate and Camembert, I couldn't face seeing any more ribs, stomachs and hipbones. Saint Laurent himself looked like a sweet old boy who'd tell you to button up your coat if it was cold out. </p> <p>After just five days of hurtling around in taxis, schmoozy lunches and having to make a real effort with my own appearance, I was exhausted. But I had a great time and at the very least I learnt to walk in four-inch heels.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I have seen some weird and wonderful things on catwalks. Tap-dancing, cartwheeling, fake snow, real rain, boys dressed as girls, supermodels dressed as pantomime horses, Playboy centrefolds in babydoll negligees and, I'd wager, more naked breasts than Peter Stringfellow has had highlights. </p> <p>But until this week, I had rarely seen a bottom. Oh, I've seen endless back views of girls in thongs - but the nakedness serves only to accentuate the fact that there is not a bottom in sight. Catwalk models have a totally different physique from normal women. Viewed from the side they are as long and thin and sleek as eels; from behind they have shoulderblades, then pebble-path spines, then legs. No bottom. </p> <p>But at Paris couture this week, there were definitely bottoms. I'm sure of it. Not because the models had got any bigger, but because the clothes were deliberately designed to shape the wearer's behind - even to create one out of thin air, or skin and bone. </p> <p>It all started at Versace. Which seems apt, somehow, since Donatella herself has a pint-size glamour model figure with an unmistakable derri\u00e8re. She has long made clothes for women with proper curves - Ms Lopez herself (you didn't think we could get through a piece about bottoms without mentioning her, did you?) looks particularly fine in a pair of white Versace hipsters. On the catwalk, however, the Versace image has up until now been of the bosomy-but-snake-hipped Gisele ilk. </p> <p>But this time breasts were upstaged. A tortoiseshell corset over a black dress placed the emphasis firmly on the curves of the waist - going out, as well as in - for the first time in years. A pink swimsuit-dress was boned and shaped to give a tiny waist which served to make the hips look wider. A black corset dress with spiking bustier had a skirt tight to the knee, then flared, emphasising the hips by contrasting them with the radius at the knee. Until I saw Erin O'Connor, a model who resembles a skinny heron, looking as if she had hips, I had never quite realised the power of corsets. </p> <p>There were plenty of opportunities to marvel at these wonders of engineering over the next few days. At Christian Dior, the eroticism of corsets - restrained sexuality straining at its silk ribbon ties - was played to the hilt with sexy secretaries wearing basques and suspenders under sheer skirts and blouses. At Gaultier, Sophie Dahl looked utterly luscious spilling out of her bandage-tight pale pink dress, trailing ribbons. At Lacroix, Alek Wek looked heart-stopping (and possibly at risk from a heart attack) roped into a cartoonishly tight corset and thigh-high boots. </p> <p>Thankfully, the hourglass shape was also achieved by gentler means. Fishtail skirts, nipped in tight at the knee to emphasise the curve of the hips (and accentuate wiggle), were an eveningwear staple at Versace and Chanel. </p> <p>Easier still were the curvy belted suits at Valentino and Yves Saint Laurent. These are just about the only shows where couture is still about knocking 'em dead at Le Caprice rather than at the Oscars. Here, suits had sharp shoulders and slightly puffed sleeves, to accentuate a teeny-tiny belted waist; instead of falling in a sleek column from the hip, skirts were nipped in at the back to emphasise the swell of the bottom. </p> <p>While manipulating tiny bodies into a different shape may not be much of a step forward for fashion, it still felt liberating to look at bodies that weren't built like dainty skyscrapers. For almost a decade, a willowy silhouette has dominated fashion. Tom Ford's early collections for Gucci, which focused on unbuttoned shirts tucked into long hipster trousers worn with spike heels, cast a long shadow. </p> <p>Not only did those long-legged trousers look fantastic on the catwalk: real women, who tend to have a less than happy relationship with their bottoms, tried them (or the high street copies), found that they magically made hips disappear (almost) and adopted them with almost religious zeal. </p> <p>What goes around comes around and the seeds of this week's hourglass revival were sown last season at Gucci. Then, the boned corset dresses and bustiers looked almost shocking, and received a mixed reception. But perhaps the new shape will catch on now the Paris couturiers have given it their blessing. Couture, after all, is fashion's VIP room. </p> <p>The security guards are scarier, the models thinner, the free champagne of better vintage. What happens behind this red rope is naturally imitated by those who seek admittance. And being unfettered by commercial considerations, couture functions as a chichi brainstorming session for ideas that later take root in ready-to-wear collections. Fancy, women having hips. Whatever will fashion dream up next?</p>",

But at Paris couture this week, there were definitely bottoms. I'm sure of it. Not because the models had got any bigger, but because the clothes were deliberately designed to shape the wearer's behind - even to create one out of thin air, or skin and bone. It all started at Versace. Which seems apt, somehow, since Donatella herself has a pint-size glamour model figure with an unmistakable derri\u00e8re. She has long made clothes for women with proper curves - Ms Lopez herself (you didn't think we could get through a piece about bottoms without mentioning her, did you?) looks particularly fine in a pair of white Versace hipsters. On the catwalk, however, the Versace image has up until now been of the bosomy-but-snake-hipped Gisele ilk. But this time breasts were upstaged. A tortoiseshell corset over a black dress placed the emphasis firmly on the curves of the waist - going out, as well as in - for the first time in years. A pink swimsuit-dress was boned and shaped to give a tiny waist which served to make the hips look wider. A black corset dress with spiking bustier had a skirt tight to the knee, then flared, emphasising the hips by contrasting them with the radius at the knee. Until I saw Erin O'Connor, a model who resembles a skinny heron, looking as if she had hips, I had never quite realised the power of corsets. There were plenty of opportunities to marvel at these wonders of engineering over the next few days. At Christian Dior, the eroticism of corsets - restrained sexuality straining at its silk ribbon ties - was played to the hilt with sexy secretaries wearing basques and suspenders under sheer skirts and blouses. At Gaultier, Sophie Dahl looked utterly luscious spilling out of her bandage-tight pale pink dress, trailing ribbons. At Lacroix, Alek Wek looked heart-stopping (and possibly at risk from a heart attack) roped into a cartoonishly tight corset and thigh-high boots. Thankfully, the hourglass shape was also achieved by gentler means. Fishtail skirts, nipped in tight at the knee to emphasise the curve of the hips (and accentuate wiggle), were an eveningwear staple at Versace and Chanel. Easier still were the curvy belted suits at Valentino and Yves Saint Laurent. These are just about the only shows where couture is still about knocking 'em dead at Le Caprice rather than at the Oscars. Here, suits had sharp shoulders and slightly puffed sleeves, to accentuate a teeny-tiny belted waist; instead of falling in a sleek column from the hip, skirts were nipped in at the back to emphasise the swell of the bottom. While manipulating tiny bodies into a different shape may not be much of a step forward for fashion, it still felt liberating to look at bodies that weren't built like dainty skyscrapers. For almost a decade, a willowy silhouette has dominated fashion. Tom Ford's early collections for Gucci, which focused on unbuttoned shirts tucked into long hipster trousers worn with spike heels, cast a long shadow. Not only did those long-legged trousers look fantastic on the catwalk: real women, who tend to have a less than happy relationship with their bottoms, tried them (or the high street copies), found that they magically made hips disappear (almost) and adopted them with almost religious zeal. What goes around comes around and the seeds of this week's hourglass revival were sown last season at Gucci. Then, the boned corset dresses and bustiers looked almost shocking, and received a mixed reception. But perhaps the new shape will catch on now the Paris couturiers have given it their blessing. Couture, after all, is fashion's VIP room. The security guards are scarier, the models thinner, the free champagne of better vintage. What happens behind this red rope is naturally imitated by those who seek admittance. And being unfettered by commercial considerations, couture functions as a chichi brainstorming session for ideas that later take root in ready-to-wear collections. Fancy, women having hips. Whatever will fashion dream up next?",

Mr McNeil believes he will take six months or even a couple of years as a transition period, and that he is unlikely to do anything too dissimilar from being a politician for a while. Other avenues of income open to Mr Mandelson include after dinner speeches and lectures. While he may not be able to charge around \u00a320,000 per speech as John Major is said to do in the US, he still has a degree of political star quality he can capitalise on. But what chance a Lazarus-like, third ministerial comeback? \"Never going to happen,\" counsels Dr Viney, who says he would be happy to give Mr Mandelson some pointers on his next Phoenix routine.

      "bodyText": "The Express has axed its star columnist, Jane Asher, in the latest round of cost-cutting by new boss Richard Desmond. Express insiders said that Ms Asher's contract, which runs out at the end of February, will not be renewed. Today it emerged that her column, \"Tricks of the Trade\", cost the newspaper more than \u00a3200,000 a year. It dealt with solving readers' household and consumer problems. Ms Asher was on a salary of \u00a3180,000, but a writer, Alice Westgate, was also hired as a researcher for the column at a cost of around \u00a320,000 a year. On top of the salary, Ms Asher was able to claim expenses, which, sources say, included her cookery ingredients. There were also charges for photographs of her carrying her various props of the week - she insisted on being snapped by a particular photographer, John Swannell, instead of Express staff, say sources on the paper. Her demise signals the end of the \"dream team\" put together by Rosie Boycott who quit as editor yesterday. Only at the beginning of this week, Ms Asher was being touted in the Express's sister paper, the Daily Star, as part of the paper's \"dream team\". Others in the team, all appointed by former editor Rosie Boycott, included Alan Titchmarsh and Express astrologer Jonathan Cainer. Two weeks ago, Mr Cainer announced his plans to join the Mirror. The news follows the resignation yesterday of the Express's editor, Rosie Boycott, and deputy editor Chris Blackhurst. The new owner of Express Newspapers, Richard Desmond, is looking for opportunities to cut costs across the board, and has already made a number of advertising, marketing and support staff redundant. Staff fear he will now try wield the axe in the newsroom with speculation mounting that as many as 100 jobs are on the line. Jane Asher was unavailable for comment.",

And Ladbrokes is quoting 10-1 on the group taking the prized Christmas number one slot. \"Despite the fact that even the line-up has yet to be revealed and they haven't recorded a note, we believe they've got an excellent chance of the first single being a hit,\" said a Ladbrokes spokesman. \"The Australian winners Bardot went straight to number one with their first single and album - and if the release is timed right they won't have to sell that many records for it to be a big hit.\" The TV show has already attracted huge amounts of media attention making an unlikely celebrity of its maker, \"nasty\" Nigel Lythgoe. Such is the hype behind the show that even the rejected contestants have become media stars. Relevant stories Jan 22: Popstars proves big hit for ITV",

      "body": "<b>What is the scandal about?</b> <br>The story revolves around the efforts made in 1998 by two Indian tycoons to acquire British passports. They applied - and later qualified for citizenship. <p><b>So far so good. Why the scandal?</b><br>It now appears that the tycoons' applications were assisted by two Labour ministers, Peter Mandelson, then the secretary of state for trade and industry, and Keith Vaz, then a junior, unpaid, parliamentary private secretary, but now minister for Europe. Quite what the ministers did and whether or not their intervention affected the standard application process is unclear, though it now seems the tycoons received their passports in six months rather than the usual 20. That has raised eyebrows.</p> <p><b>What did the ministers do?</b><br>Peter Mandelson, who resigned on Wednesday, has admitted to making a phone call while he was at the department of trade and industry to the then immigration minister, Mike O'Brien. The call - says Mr O'Brien - lasted less than two minutes. Mr Mandelson apparently enquired about the progress of the application made by one of the tycoons, SP Hinduja. He says he did not lobby on the man's behalf and merely asked whether new rules would help the application. Since Mr Mandelson's resignation, Keith Vaz has also admitted involvement in the applications, writing to the Home Office to ask about the progress of the applications. He says he too has nothing to hide.</p> <p><b>So why has Mr Mandelson resigned?</b><br>Because he did not make the fact that he had telephoned about the application clear to the culture secretary, Chris Smith (who had to answer a Commons question on the subject), or to the prime minister's press secretary, Alistair Campbell. Mr Campbell told journalists at a briefing on Monday that Peter Mandelson had not been involved. On Tuesday he had to admit that this information was wrong and shortly afterwards Mr Mandelson resigned, for misleading colleagues and, indirectly, parliament.</p> <p><b>So if he had come clean earlier, would he have had to resign?</b><br>Probably not. Though the phone call may technically have been in breach of some rules governing ministerial conduct, the offence was not a serious one - unless Mr Mandelson and Mr Vaz had actively lobbied on behalf of the Hinduja brothers. They say that they did not and are willing to cooperate with an enquiry that the government has set up.</p> <p><b>What will happen next?</b><br>The Conservative party will want to make Keith Vaz resign, too and hope to tag the prime minister with accusations of sleaze. But they may find this difficult, not least because it seems that the Hinduja brothers also associated with several Tory politicians, including the former prime minister, Sir Edward Heath.</p> <p><b>Full text</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">The resignation speech</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/\">Mandelson resigns</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Mandelson: a career in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124white.ra\">Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14)</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427479,00.html\">24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427569,00.html\">24.01.2001: Blair backs 'courageous' Mandelson </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427562,00.html\">24.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427481,00.html\">24.01.2001, analysis: Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427491,00.html\">24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427558,00.html\">24.01.2001, analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427475,00.html\">24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,427264,00.html\">Profile: Srichand Hinduja</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427465,00.html\">24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,427417,00.html\">Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3291\" target=\"_new\">Press briefing</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a><br><a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a> </p>",

Nearer the site, it's shocking to see that the mudslide has left occasional houses and streets standing, when logic tells you they should have been crushed along with the rest. Cars are mangled and twisted out of all recognition, except for the odd wheel. Personal items litter the mud. And, in the midst of all this destruction, untouched shrubs of crimson bougainvillea blossom against whitewashed walls, reminding you of the quiet residential streets that have disappeared. While the number of deaths - 700 to 1,000 - is shocking and many residents of Santa Tecla are unable to bury their dead, people are slowly turning their attention to the enormous task of helping the living to get back on their feet. It's thought that at least 1m people, out of a population of 6.5m, have been affected by the quake, with 185,000 homes damaged or totally destroyed. The figures are difficult to grasp. Talking to families in the camps, you begin to see what it means. But what brought it closer to home was sitting in front of the hotel computer last night in a slight daze because of the late hour. I became aware of an underground train passing beneath the hotel. Within seconds, I realised it was my first aftershock. I jumped up and ran into the foyer. Postcards were shaking in their stand, but no other effects were visible and it was over in about 10 seconds. But I had an inkling of what the Salvadorans have just experienced and the uncertainty they are still feeling.",

FCB 20-80, owned by the True North advertising group, will develop a global campaign to build awareness of a new resort format aimed at young holidaymakers. The main Club Med ad account is held by Publicis, which is also thought to have pitched for the Bazic business. The Bazic concept offers stripped-down holiday resorts run along similar lines to low-cost airlines. Club Med believes an emphasis on sport and music - with rudimentary levels of service and simple accommodation - will appeal to the booming market of 18 to 30- year-olds. The first Bazic resort will open in Tunisia this summer and around 10 more should follow over the next five years. Club Med, 50 years old this month, has traditionally aimed its all-inclusive resort concept at middle-class couples. But Philippe Bourguignon, the former Disney executive who took over as chief executive in 1997, is gradually revolutionising the chain, having rescued it from near bankruptcy. He has revamped Club Med's 120 resorts and brought down prices to make the holidays appeal to families.

Mr Vaz said publication would have to wait until after a government inquiry led by Sir Anthony Hammond QC. The prime minister, Tony Blair, lent the minister support today, saying: \"From the look of the papers I have seen I cannot see anything wrong with what has been done. \"Keith is a prominent Asian MP, they are prominent people from the Asian community - he made representations on their behalf.\" Mr Blair, speaking in his Sedgefield constituency, added: \"I cannot see anything wrong in him making representations on [behalf of] other members of the Asian community.\" Mr Vaz, MP for Leicester East, has become embroiled in the controversy over the application for naturalisation by wealthy Indian brothers Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja. The controversy that followed Peter Mandelson's resignation over the row showed no sign of dying down today with the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, tabling parliamentary questions asking for more details. The Home Office has already disclosed that Mr Vaz asked when decisions would be made in the brothers' cases. \"Let's get the facts, let's not talk about innuendo,\" Mr Vaz told BBC Radio Leicester this morning. \"Let's put aside all the garbage that's written about Peter Mandelson.

Mr Hague has said a \"whiff of suspicion\" was hanging over the government and warned ministers against trying to duck outstanding questions by hiding behind Sir Anthony's review.

      "bodyText": "Software giant Microsoft admitted late last night that it was the victim of hackers who left millions of customers without access to popular services like Hotmail and Expedia for most of Thursday. Yesterday marked the third day running that Microsoft web sites had been down, though the company said site failures on Tuesday and Wednesday were due to an error made by a company technician and not a hacker. The company has asked the FBI to investigate Thursday's incident, which Microsoft described as a denial-of-service attack. These attacks happen when hackers flood a network with useless traffic so that it cannot respond to normal requests from users. The company said that normal access has now been restored, and added: \"It is unfortunate that an individual or group of individuals would engage in this kind of illegal activity. Microsoft has made the FBI aware of this situation.\" Similar attacks caused problems for companies like Amazon, CNN, eBay and Yahoo! last year. Last week, a 16-year-old Canadian boy known as \"Mafiaboy\" pleaded guilty to 56 charges of mischief in connection with some of those attacks. Ten other charges were dropped. Microsoft, which prides itself on providing reliable internet access, was quick to point out that none of the site failures had anything to do with its software. \"This was an operational error, and not the result of any issue with Microsoft or third party products nor the security of our networks.

Money and power make explosive chemistry: the struggle to separate the two has been the story of the birth of democracy since the first reform acts ended pocket boroughs and public voting. Yet the world's leading democracies are all mired in financial scandals. The stench of politicians trading favours and honours for cash hangs in a thick pall from the Potomac to the Rhine. Little of it concerns old fashioned Jonathan Aitken or Neil Hamilton back-handers. Most of it concerns raising private money for political parties or for semi-political projects like the dome. Enough words have sent Peter Mandelson on his lonely way: the man has paid a painful price. But the question remains - should democratic politicians ever be put into a position where they have to raise vast sums from rich men? As a mea culpa, Labour's manifesto should now include a pledge to end political fund-raising sleaze once and for all and commit to state funding and regulation of parties from now on.</p> <p>The party conferences reek of ill-gotten cash, more each year that passes. Delegates and press alike are forcibly decked out in advertising slogans of sponsors on security passes. Everything is sponsored, chairs you sit on, air you breathe, all sponsors fruitily praised and thanked for the canapes and drinks at meetings or the printing of the party agenda packs, as ministers scuttle between gold plate dinners among the fund-raising access, easements and embellishments. Looking round the colossal exhibition halls at Labour's conference last year, the smell of lucre from industrialists, lobbyists, benefactors and even cash-paying fatcat charities overpowered the fish and chips. What were they all doing there, paying a small fortune for their showy booths to catch the politicians' eyes? Either it was for the personal vanity of CEOs who want to be there while their shareholders or charity fund collectors pay the bill - or it is plain cash for influence. An aroma of favours, the minister's ear, influence, greasy palms, the shimmer of power swills together in foetid hotel meeting rooms. Innocent by US standards, nothing like the ostentatious company champagne flowing at Tory conferences in their glory days, still small beer - but this is how it begins.</p> <p>Its tentacles reach out to the think-tanks and party affiliates. Those that can persuade potential benefactors that they have the true ear of their party leaders can expect rich rewards in spon sorship money. Is it because companies, banks or management consultancies genuinely want to nurture creative new political thought? More likely they hope that linking their name to a close party organisation will somehow, some day ease their way into whatever it is they want - a contract or just a pleasing rubbing of shoulders with the mighty for their managing director.</p> <p>It is the big money from the millionaires that is most lethally damaging. Asil Nadir, Jeffrey Archer, Michael Ashcroft, the Hindujas, Bernie Ecclestone, Michael Wheeler, Stanley Kalms, Robert Bourne - whether eccentrics or sincere believers, whether paying to steer the party's ideology or paying for naked gain, the mud always sticks. And it sticks both ways. Scrupulously honest men like David Sainsbury or Paul Hamlyn get tarred with the same brush by the simple act of giving to a cause they support: in politics generosity is turned to acid spite. There is no free lunch, there is no donation without strings. Even those who want nothing are still using their deep pockets to promote the party of their choice. But the days of buying elections must be over now. A royal commission should be appointed to devise a generally acceptable fair funding formula: there is no perfect system, but anything is better than government by millionaire.</p> <p>Labour has been oddly tentative about this. Not because it has anything to fear - it is the Tories who might suffer more from fair state funding. The Blairites fear that politicians and parties are so thoroughly loathed that the public would rebel at taxpayers' money paying for Millbank and Central Office. This super-caution on all electoral reform is Labour cowardice: part of the reason for cynicism, low turnout and sinking public trust is because of the slush money. On the doorsteps too many people say: \"None of them! They're all the same, only in it for themselves!\" They do not distinguish clearly between dubious party fundraising and criminal lining of politicians' pockets. Voters would be easily persuaded that a piffling sum from the Treasury - around \u00a350m - is a price well worth paying for seagreen incorruptibility. A royal commission would have to devise a quid pro quo for state funding: the IPPR points out that present near-derelict parties would need a duty to engage voters with a recruit-or-die formula instead of running local democracy as private fiefdoms.</p> <p>On February 16, the Neill/Nolan reforms come into force obliging revelation of all gifts over \u00a35,000 and banning foreign donors. But each revelation only adds to public contempt. This election each party will be capped at \u00a320m, money splashed all over the country in gigantic hoardings selling incredible promises and preposterous insults against the enemy that bring politics into disrepute. People will rightly see this as money badly raised and badly spent, futile frittering of fortunes to virtually zero electoral effect, offending the voters' IQ. Trade unions (30%) and individual big donors (20%) now pay for half Labour funding: an unknown but higher proportion of Tory costs are paid by companies and big donors. Tony Blair said he was \"absolutely proud\" of the mega- donations from successful entrepreneurs. He cannot be serious - but how can he admit it is shaming and humiliating to a democratic leader?</p> <p>This is a pretty clean government. Venality accusations just don't stick to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown or the rest - so how have they allowed Eccelstone and Hinduja allegations to sink them in the mud? Because big money will always corrode politics. Helmut Kohl's giant reputation for uniting Germany when lesser leaders might have hesi tated now lies in perpetual ruin because of illegal channelling of \u00a3600,000 in undisclosed donations to his party. French president Jacques Chirac and his party likewise are mired in allegations of selling building contracts for party-funding deals. As for George Bush, nearly \u00a3.5bn was raised and spent in hard and soft money - hugely more than Al Gore: the indulgences it bought are already rolling out. How is the west to high-horse it over third world dictatorships diverting national treasuries into Swiss bank accounts if our own democratic elections are financed by cash for favours?</p> <p>This is Labour high ground and Labour should go for it, do it now and defy the Tories to defend the buying of votes by plutocrats.</p> <p>polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</p>",

      "body": "<p>The career of Libertad Lamarque, who has died aged 92, spanned more than 70 years. In the 1930s, she was one of Argentina's great tango singers and first cinema stars; later, she left the country after a public fight with the young Eva Duarte, \"Evita\" Per\u00f3n.</p> <p>Born in Rosario, on the Rio de la Plata, Lamarque was the daughter of an ironmonger, himself the child of French immigrants. It was in sketches he wrote for the anarchists that she began to perform, and the family moved to Buenos Aires to promote her career. In 1926, she began singing tangos in Calle Corrientes variety shows, and, in 1932, won a national contest, from whence she became universally known as the \"queen of tango\".</p> <p>It seemed that her own life came straight out of tango and its passions. She was married at 18, and had her only child, her daughter Mirtha. The marriage did not last, and stormy love affairs followed. One story recalls how, desperate in love, Lamarque threw herself out of a hotel window while performing in the Chilean capital, Santiago, only to land on top of a dentist who happened to be walking by. This saved her life, and the dentist became a hero throughout Latin America.</p> <p>Lamarque also had great acting talent. She was fortunate to come to the fore just as the film industry was starting up, and in 1929 appeared in Adi\u00f3s Argentina, shot in a single day by the Italian Mario Parpagnoli.

      "bodyText": "The career of Libertad Lamarque, who has died aged 92, spanned more than 70 years. In the 1930s, she was one of Argentina's great tango singers and first cinema stars; later, she left the country after a public fight with the young Eva Duarte, \"Evita\" Per\u00f3n. Born in Rosario, on the Rio de la Plata, Lamarque was the daughter of an ironmonger, himself the child of French immigrants. It was in sketches he wrote for the anarchists that she began to perform, and the family moved to Buenos Aires to promote her career. In 1926, she began singing tangos in Calle Corrientes variety shows, and, in 1932, won a national contest, from whence she became universally known as the \"queen of tango\". It seemed that her own life came straight out of tango and its passions. She was married at 18, and had her only child, her daughter Mirtha. The marriage did not last, and stormy love affairs followed. One story recalls how, desperate in love, Lamarque threw herself out of a hotel window while performing in the Chilean capital, Santiago, only to land on top of a dentist who happened to be walking by. This saved her life, and the dentist became a hero throughout Latin America. Lamarque also had great acting talent. She was fortunate to come to the fore just as the film industry was starting up, and in 1929 appeared in Adi\u00f3s Argentina, shot in a single day by the Italian Mario Parpagnoli. Four years later, she starred in what is generally regarded as Argentina's first sound film, appropriately enough entitled Tango! The 1930s were boom years in Argentine cinema, and Lamarque was tied into film production just like a Hollywood star, churning out one or two movies a year. In these, she represented the suffering woman who - in a world full of faithless men, impossible love, treacherous female friends, and dying children - found her only consolation in the bittersweet melancholy of the tango. These films met with an enormous success throughout Latin America, and proved more popular than anything offered by Hollywood; Argentinians like to say that it was to steal her talents that Lamarque was offered a huge Hollywood contract. She refused, staying on to make more films in Argentina, and marry a second time, to her long-standing companion, Alfredo Malerba.

So I'm betting on them both.</p> <p>Everton can't score for Toffee (I'm really sorry) unless they're playing Coventry, and if a team like Manchester City can put five past them, a Jason Koumas-inspired Tranmere can certainly grind out another Cup shock.</p> <p>The other bet looks more dodgy, as Southampton are solid and have a good home record.

      "bodyText": "Current totals (from their initial \u00a3100 kitties): Scott Murray = \u00a3154.49, Sean Ingle = \u00a352.75, Football Unlimited punters collective = \u00a339.40, Paul MacInnes = \u00a328.15 Scott Murray: Sheffield Wednesday to win at Southampton (\u00a35 at 15/2); Tranmere to win at Everton (\u00a35 at 13/2). It's Super Bowl weekend. Shall I watch the big game with a corn dog and a soda? What about a Sloppy Joe and a root beer? Or maybe I'll cheer on the Red Bay Sox or whoever the hell is playing with salami with extra mayo on rye, followed by a burger. Sometimes it's difficult making choices. Sometimes, like couch-bound US sports fans, it's best to go for the lot, just to be sure. This week, I can't decide whether the FA Cup shock of the weekend will see Tranmere win at Everton or Sheffield Wednesday triumph at Southampton. So I'm betting on them both. Everton can't score for Toffee (I'm really sorry) unless they're playing Coventry, and if a team like Manchester City can put five past them, a Jason Koumas-inspired Tranmere can certainly grind out another Cup shock. The other bet looks more dodgy, as Southampton are solid and have a good home record. But they're not scoring at the moment, a problem that could be exacerbated if James Beattie misses the game with head and foot injuries - and the return of Marian Pahars could mean little if he's stuck out on the wing again. Wednesday have already dumped one Premiership team out of cup competition this season - West Ham in the Worthy - and if Koumas can inspire Tranmere at Everton, someone like Owen Morrison can scrape a winner here. Pretzel, anyone? Sean Ingle: Most goals tomorrow selection: \u00a35 on Bristol City @ 3/1 and \u00a32 on Sunderland at 12/1. With my betting stash dropping faster than Chris Evans's trousers, I've decided to switch tack. Again. I like the look of Blue Square's Special on which team out of the eight they have chosen - Charlton, Bristol City, Southampton, Arsenal, Sunderland, Everton, Blackburn and Manchester City - will score the most goals tomorrow. You can virtually write off the last three teams - and I don't fancy Southampton to put many past Sheffield Wednesday either.

Joe Fortune of the Football Unlimited Punters Collective: Sunderland v Ipswich - half-time draw, full-time Sunderland \u00a35 @ 4/1. I'd expect Sunderland should win this as they have an excellent home record, while Ipswich are coming off of a 4-1 thumping at Chelsea. However, Sunderland aren't the most prolific of scorers and Ipswich have an excellent away record, which makes me think it will be quite a tight game. Hence it seems quite likely that the sides will make it to half-time on level terms, with Sunderland's home advantage hopefully telling thereafter (Marcus Stewart not willing). Make sure and get some rest, poorly Paul MacInnes!",

      "bodyText": "The government has said there is \"no question\" of the UK government following Scotland's lead in offering free personal care to people living in residential homes in England and Wales. Ministers stood firm today in the face of claims that the Scottish executive's shock decision would create a \"two-tier system\" of elderly care in the UK. But they face renewed pressure to amend elderly care policy after the Scottish executive was last night forced to offer free long-term care for Scotland's pensioners. The Scottish executive promised to introduce free personal care \"as soon as practicable\" in an astonishing policy u-turn designed to head off a potentially damaging parliamentary defeat. The decision reversed an announcement made 24 hours earlier in which the executive said it would not make personal care for the elderly universally free. Events in Scotland immediately gave fresh hope to campaigners in England, who hope to persuade the government to change their position on long term care. Age Concern director general Gordon Lishman said Westminster would now have to \"seriously consider\" bringing policy into line with Scotland. Proposals to provide free nursing care - but means tested personal care - in England and Wales are contained in the health and social care bill currently working its way through parliament. Commons select committee chair David Hinchliffe said he wanted to see the government make amendments to the bill, which is currently at committee stage. But health minister John Hutton said there was \"no question\" of the government following Scotland's lead. He told the BBC: \"Both the government and the Scottish executive are committed to improving health and social care services for older people, but we are doing it in different ways. \"We do not believe that this would be the best way forward for improving elderly care services in England.\"",

Lady Goldsmith was on the plane with her daughter Jemima Khan and other celebrities, including singer Bryan Ferry. She said she \"watched aghast as the BBC portrayed Paul Mukonyi in a sympathetic light\" in its Ten O'Clock News on Monday night. Mr Mukonyi had seized the controls of the BA jumbo jet on a flight to Nairobi, almost causing it to crash. The BBC bulletin led with the interview, which was branded an \"exclusive\", on the night it went head to head with ITV's reinstated News at Ten. In a letter published in today's Daily Telegraph, Lady Goldsmith said: \"Mr Mukonyi was interviewed in bed.

      "body": "<p>Our bus was full when it left Tangiers, but it's even fuller now. Along the way we've picked up a dozen extra passengers and they're standing, crammed in the aisle, for a six-hour journey.</p> <p>This is both illegal and dangerous, but not to worry - the surplus passengers don't officially exist. They won't show up in the bus company's records because they haven't got tickets. Instead, they have come to a private understanding with the driver and conductor.</p> <p>Financially, this is a happy arrangement for all concerned. The extra passengers pay less than full fare, while the driver and conductor make some money on the side - which in turn saves the bus company the expense of paying them a decent wage.</p> <p>Getting money is one thing, but hanging onto it in a poor country like Morocco is something else: other people want a share.</p> <p>You can't go many miles along a main road without coming to a police checkpoint where officers are on the lookout for overcrowded vehicles, or those with bald tyres, smoky exhausts and other defects they'll be prepared to ignore in exchange for a few dirhams.</p> <p>As we approach the checkpoints the conductor tells the standing passengers to sit on the floor so that they can't be seen through the windows.</p> <p>The police order the bus to stop but they don't take a look inside. Instead, the conductor folds up a small banknote in the palm of his hand and gets out to greet one of the officers. He shakes hands with the policeman. The policeman's hand slides discreetly into his pocket and out again, then he waves us on. Everything is in order.</p> <p>Last Monday a crowded bus on another route - from Marrakesh to Asni in the Atlas mountains - careered off the road and rolled down a hillside, killing 31 people and injuring 34.</p> <p>Nobody in Morocco was terribly surprised by this, and the local media that bothered to report the tragedy had little to say beyond emphasising that King Mohammed had personally sent condolences to the victims' families and that the injured were being treated in military hospitals (ie the sort with decent facilities).</p> <p>A full investigation into the accident has been promised but whatever it finds, you can be sure that any part played by roadside corruption will not be mentioned.</p> <p>Cavalier approaches to safety are not just a Moroccan problem, but they are certainly a bigger problem in Arab countries than in the west. Nor is it just a matter of road accidents: the number of jerry-built houses in Egypt, for example, that fall down, killing their occupants, is quite amazing.</p> <p>At one level, this can be blamed on a widespread sense of fatalism - that God alone determines whether we live or die. In most Middle Eastern countries if you get into a taxi and try to fasten your seat belt, the driver will, if he's in a good mood, merely ridicule you. The more macho ones treat it as defamatory comment on their driving skills. Many cars have colourful stickers on their dashboard saying, in Arabic calligraphy, \"Ma sha' Allah\" (Whatever God wills).</p> <p>In the poorer countries, fatalism is coupled with a belief that safety is an expensive luxury. It is certainly cheaper to put your trust in God and buy a little sticker to say so, than to replace worn-out brake linings.</p> <p>Sometimes this comes down to a choice between daily necessities and hypothetical possibilities. Imagine a family whose only source of income is the father's unroadworthy taxi. Should they go short of food in order to repair it, or carry on and pray that he won't have an accident?</p> <p>That, of course, is where safety laws come in: to protect us from our own (and other people's) reluctance to take precautions. But laws in the Middle East are rarely what they seem. Often they exist, not for the public good, but for the good of those appointed to enforce them.</p> <p>Anyone who is inconvenienced by a law can usually get round it by lubricating the bureaucracy with a little cash. Over time, this becomes the norm and laws serve only to generate income for the officials in charge.</p> <p>Privately, most Arabs find the system disgusting. Some quote a verse from the Koran which says that the person who pays a bribe is as guilty as the person who receives it - but a refusal to pay can, at the very least, prove enormously time-consuming.</p> <p>Others find ways to avoid a confrontation. One Moroccan of my acquaintance bought a stethoscope which he keeps on his car's dashboard where any policeman who stops him will see it and assume he's a doctor. Policemen, he says, are superstitious about harassing doctors lest they be struck down with sickness.</p> <p>From time to time, when the level of grumbling gets too much, governments announce an anti-corruption drive. In Yemen, a couple of years ago, the president reportedly drove incognito from Sana'a to Aden to see how many policemen would ask for bribes along the way. That certainly scared a few people, but nothing more.</p> <p>Once institutionalised, corruption becomes very difficult to eradicate. A good first step, in many countries, would be to reduce temptation by paying the police (and other officials) a decent salary. But that would mean putting up taxes - and persuading people to pay them without bribing the tax collectors.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:brian.whitaker@theguardian.com\"> brian.whitaker@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel &amp; the Middle East</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/0,2759,180403,00.html\">Iraq</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yemen/0,2759,193338,00.html\">Yemen</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/The_Kurds/0,2759,192981,00.html\">The Kurds</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28brian+whitaker%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=brian+whitaker&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Brian Whitaker</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Al-bab.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.arabicnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Arabic News</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.middleeastwire.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East News Online</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.middleeastdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East Daily</a></p>",

Along the way we've picked up a dozen extra passengers and they're standing, crammed in the aisle, for a six-hour journey. This is both illegal and dangerous, but not to worry - the surplus passengers don't officially exist. They won't show up in the bus company's records because they haven't got tickets. Instead, they have come to a private understanding with the driver and conductor. Financially, this is a happy arrangement for all concerned. The extra passengers pay less than full fare, while the driver and conductor make some money on the side - which in turn saves the bus company the expense of paying them a decent wage. Getting money is one thing, but hanging onto it in a poor country like Morocco is something else: other people want a share. You can't go many miles along a main road without coming to a police checkpoint where officers are on the lookout for overcrowded vehicles, or those with bald tyres, smoky exhausts and other defects they'll be prepared to ignore in exchange for a few dirhams. As we approach the checkpoints the conductor tells the standing passengers to sit on the floor so that they can't be seen through the windows. The police order the bus to stop but they don't take a look inside. Instead, the conductor folds up a small banknote in the palm of his hand and gets out to greet one of the officers. He shakes hands with the policeman. The policeman's hand slides discreetly into his pocket and out again, then he waves us on. Everything is in order. Last Monday a crowded bus on another route - from Marrakesh to Asni in the Atlas mountains - careered off the road and rolled down a hillside, killing 31 people and injuring 34. Nobody in Morocco was terribly surprised by this, and the local media that bothered to report the tragedy had little to say beyond emphasising that King Mohammed had personally sent condolences to the victims' families and that the injured were being treated in military hospitals (ie the sort with decent facilities). A full investigation into the accident has been promised but whatever it finds, you can be sure that any part played by roadside corruption will not be mentioned. Cavalier approaches to safety are not just a Moroccan problem, but they are certainly a bigger problem in Arab countries than in the west. Nor is it just a matter of road accidents: the number of jerry-built houses in Egypt, for example, that fall down, killing their occupants, is quite amazing. At one level, this can be blamed on a widespread sense of fatalism - that God alone determines whether we live or die. In most Middle Eastern countries if you get into a taxi and try to fasten your seat belt, the driver will, if he's in a good mood, merely ridicule you. The more macho ones treat it as defamatory comment on their driving skills. Many cars have colourful stickers on their dashboard saying, in Arabic calligraphy, \"Ma sha' Allah\" (Whatever God wills). In the poorer countries, fatalism is coupled with a belief that safety is an expensive luxury. It is certainly cheaper to put your trust in God and buy a little sticker to say so, than to replace worn-out brake linings. Sometimes this comes down to a choice between daily necessities and hypothetical possibilities. Imagine a family whose only source of income is the father's unroadworthy taxi. Should they go short of food in order to repair it, or carry on and pray that he won't have an accident? That, of course, is where safety laws come in: to protect us from our own (and other people's) reluctance to take precautions. But laws in the Middle East are rarely what they seem. Often they exist, not for the public good, but for the good of those appointed to enforce them. Anyone who is inconvenienced by a law can usually get round it by lubricating the bureaucracy with a little cash. Over time, this becomes the norm and laws serve only to generate income for the officials in charge. Privately, most Arabs find the system disgusting. Some quote a verse from the Koran which says that the person who pays a bribe is as guilty as the person who receives it - but a refusal to pay can, at the very least, prove enormously time-consuming. Others find ways to avoid a confrontation. One Moroccan of my acquaintance bought a stethoscope which he keeps on his car's dashboard where any policeman who stops him will see it and assume he's a doctor. Policemen, he says, are superstitious about harassing doctors lest they be struck down with sickness. From time to time, when the level of grumbling gets too much, governments announce an anti-corruption drive. In Yemen, a couple of years ago, the president reportedly drove incognito from Sana'a to Aden to see how many policemen would ask for bribes along the way. That certainly scared a few people, but nothing more. Once institutionalised, corruption becomes very difficult to eradicate. A good first step, in many countries, would be to reduce temptation by paying the police (and other officials) a decent salary. But that would mean putting up taxes - and persuading people to pay them without bribing the tax collectors.

      "body": "<p>With George Bush now installed, the defeated Democratic Party is beginning to contemplate post-Clinton realities rather than to agonise about what might have been.</p> <p>There were two clear signs of that at the top this week. First, Al Gore emerged from media exile to announce that he is getting a new life next month as a lecturer at Columbia University and at two colleges in his home state of Tennessee.</p> <p>Second, at a lunch for Democratic senators this week, their leader Tom Daschle faced his colleagues with the cold facts. They no longer control the White House, the Senate or the House of Representatives. \"All we have is us,\" Daschle said. \"Our only hope of survival is each other.\"</p> <p>Things are moving on in American politics. Bush is finding his way in the White House - and is making an impressively confident start. Florida is beginning to become just a memory. Bill Clinton has left the stage in a cloud of criticism over his pardons and his unembarrassed exit from which the dust has not yet quite settled. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, is trying to understand what hit it.</p> <p>The debate inside the party started in earnest this week. It's an important debate, and not just for the Democrats themselves. It will shape the next decade of American politics. It will be carefully watched from abroad too, and by no one more intently that by the British Labour Party, which has developed a not entirely healthy habit of seeing American politics as a dry run for future British developments. If only it took European domestic politics half so seriously.</p> <p>The most striking thing about the US debate is simply that there is very little agreement. In recent weeks, two of Gore's pollsters have each produced analyses of what went wrong, but the question they ask is just about the only thing the two analyses have in common.</p> <p>Mark Penn, who became pollster of choice to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, released a report this week which was a devastating centrist indictment of Gore and his campaign. Gore's \"populist\" campaign - with its emphasis on working families, its attack on tax cuts that favoured the rich, and its emphasis on an activist government - worked well with the party faithful, Penn concluded. But it fell far short with the swing voters who could have pushed him over the top.</p> <p>In particular, Penn argued, Gore's decision not to talk about the Clinton administration's economic achievements meant that the Democrats forsook a golden opportunity to win over the large majority of Americans who felt that the US was on the right track.</p> <p>The contrast between Penn's analysis and that of Gore's other pollster, Stanley Greenberg, a familiar crony of Tony Blair through his connection with Labour's Philip Gould, was striking. Greenberg has offered a robust defence of what Gore tried to do.</p> <p>Gore was hamstrung by four factors, Greenberg argues. First, the 2000 election was a cultural battle, in which hostility to Clinton's scandals severely constrained Gore from celebrating the Clinton legacy. Second, Gore mishandled the campaign at key moments, leading to doubts about his trustworthiness. Third, Bush successfully blurred a lot of issues by his compassionate conservatism campaign.

      "bodyText": "With George Bush now installed, the defeated Democratic Party is beginning to contemplate post-Clinton realities rather than to agonise about what might have been. There were two clear signs of that at the top this week. First, Al Gore emerged from media exile to announce that he is getting a new life next month as a lecturer at Columbia University and at two colleges in his home state of Tennessee. Second, at a lunch for Democratic senators this week, their leader Tom Daschle faced his colleagues with the cold facts. They no longer control the White House, the Senate or the House of Representatives. \"All we have is us,\" Daschle said. \"Our only hope of survival is each other.\" Things are moving on in American politics. Bush is finding his way in the White House - and is making an impressively confident start. Florida is beginning to become just a memory. Bill Clinton has left the stage in a cloud of criticism over his pardons and his unembarrassed exit from which the dust has not yet quite settled. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, is trying to understand what hit it. The debate inside the party started in earnest this week. It's an important debate, and not just for the Democrats themselves. It will shape the next decade of American politics. It will be carefully watched from abroad too, and by no one more intently that by the British Labour Party, which has developed a not entirely healthy habit of seeing American politics as a dry run for future British developments. If only it took European domestic politics half so seriously. The most striking thing about the US debate is simply that there is very little agreement. In recent weeks, two of Gore's pollsters have each produced analyses of what went wrong, but the question they ask is just about the only thing the two analyses have in common. Mark Penn, who became pollster of choice to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, released a report this week which was a devastating centrist indictment of Gore and his campaign. Gore's \"populist\" campaign - with its emphasis on working families, its attack on tax cuts that favoured the rich, and its emphasis on an activist government - worked well with the party faithful, Penn concluded. But it fell far short with the swing voters who could have pushed him over the top. In particular, Penn argued, Gore's decision not to talk about the Clinton administration's economic achievements meant that the Democrats forsook a golden opportunity to win over the large majority of Americans who felt that the US was on the right track. The contrast between Penn's analysis and that of Gore's other pollster, Stanley Greenberg, a familiar crony of Tony Blair through his connection with Labour's Philip Gould, was striking. Greenberg has offered a robust defence of what Gore tried to do. Gore was hamstrung by four factors, Greenberg argues. First, the 2000 election was a cultural battle, in which hostility to Clinton's scandals severely constrained Gore from celebrating the Clinton legacy. Second, Gore mishandled the campaign at key moments, leading to doubts about his trustworthiness. Third, Bush successfully blurred a lot of issues by his compassionate conservatism campaign. Fourth, there are a lot of white working class men in America who basically dislike government and who preferred Bush to Gore in the absence of a Ross Perot or a Jesse Ventura. These are big differences - and this summary only scratches the surface of the strikingly contrasted picture that the two men's reports paint. And these are only two, albeit two very well-placed, voices among many others. At a seminar in Washington this week, organised by the centrist Democratic Leadership Council (for whom Penn is the house pollster), there was a strong defence of Gore by trade union political strategists, who pointed out that Gore's most successful moments in the campaign all came when he went unashamedly to the left in the manner of which Penn and the DLC so disapproved. Meanwhile, at the same seminar, there was also a devastating attack on Gore's handling of the campaign from the man whose intervention played such a crucial role in ensuring that Bush won the election, the Green candidate Ralph Nader. The Democrats' willingness to debate these issues is undoubtedly a healthy sign. Whether the party can really agree about what went wrong, on the other hand, and what they can do about it if they can agree, remain very uncertain. There is a great danger, one senses, that the participants will simply fasten on the conclusions which confirm their prejudices, which is certainly what seems to have happened in Labour's internal reflections on the US election. Meanwhile, as Gore heads off to give a few recuperative lectures, the question of who will lead the party against Bush in 2004 will begin to be asked more soon than it should. In that respect, the event to watch is not Gore's lectures, or Hillary Clinton's performance in the senate, let alone the debate among the strategists and pollsters. It is how Governor Gray Davis handles California's energy crisis. If the Democrats don't realise the political significance of Davis's performance in this testing emergency, I can assure you that the Republicans certainly do.

It is understood that an emergency meeting of RCN council last night agreed to offer Ms Malone the \u00a3100,000-a-year post and she is expected to accept within days. Ms Malone, a deputy assistant secretary at the US Department of Health, was chosen from a shortlist of four for the top job. Her appointment follows a row within the college over who should succeed the present general secretary Christine Hancock, who is leaving to be president of the international council of nurses. Ms Malone's arrival could see the departure of deputy RCN general secretary Tom Bolger, who was controversially not shortlisted for the position. Another internal candidate who was not shortlisted, RCN head of policy Pippa Gough, is understood to have already resigned. Ms Malone has a formidable reputation in international nursing circles and was named by Ebony magazine as one of the most influential African-Americans. However, she could face a rocky introduction to the UK nursing scene - she is not currently registered within the UK as a nurse, and there is speculation that she may face problems obtaining a UK work permit.

      "body": "<p>British troops were shot at by Kosovo Albanians yesterday on the boundary with Serbia. The soldiers, part of the K-for peacekeeping force in Kosovo, were trying to prevent the flow of men and weapons to and from the province.</p> <p>The patrol from the first battalion, the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, challenged a group of 10 armed men crossing from Serbia into Kosovo. The gang responded by firing two shots and running off. Nobody was hurt.</p> <p>Those who recruit and train the gunmen say they are preparing for a new offensive.</p> <p>Tension on the boundary has increased since K-for stepped up its patrols in October after ethnic Albanian militiamen, some of them disgruntled former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, began trying to take over three Albanian towns in southern Serbia.</p> <p>On Wednesday the British commander in the area, Lieutenant-Colonel Stephen Kilpatrick, met leaders of the rebel bands to try to avoid just such an incident.</p> <p>But while K-for tries to keep a lid on the situation, Belgrade fumes at the Albanian attempt on Serbian territory, and local people grow more apprehensive, the rebels are busy training more fighters. A ceasefire agreed in November is only just holding.</p> <p>At a training camp in the area, the two men in charge - who gave their names as Commander Zola and Commander Rama - said they had trained up to 600 volunteers in 10 months.</p> <p>The camp belongs to a group calling itself the Karadaku brigade.</p> <p>The commanders disputed the US estimate of the current Albanian fighting force in this sector, saying it was four or five times greater.</p> <p>Whatever the truth about the numbers of gunmen, the continued existence of the training camp shows that the Nato-led peacekeeping force has been unable to stop the rebel movement, though its action has put some constraints on the commanders.</p> <p>The camp lies in the hills near the boundary with Kosovo and border with Macedonia. It is away from the eyes of Yugoslav troops and Serb police, to whom the area is off-limits, under the terms agreed with Nato.</p> <p>Up to 60 recruits are in the camp at any time and are given a month of basic training.</p> <p>\"Then they go home and wait, so they are ready for when the fighting starts,\" Commander Rama said.</p> <p>\"We are preparing for war but are always ready to give a chance to diplomacy. War will happen when everything else fails.\"</p> <p>The recruitment goes on while K-for tries to foster talks between local Albanian leaders and the Yugoslav government.</p> <p>\"Currently we are under a peace agreement,\" said Commander Rama.</p> <p>\"All the same, our warriors are getting trained and armed to be ready for an offensive to get the Serbs out of this area.\"</p> <p>The rebel movement in this corner of Kosovo and Serbia emerged in February last year. It wants independence for three Albanian populated towns in southern Serbia, and names itself after them, the liberation army of Presevo Medvedja, and Bujanovac, (UCPMB).</p> <p>Its existence has become a real embarrassment to K-for, because the gunmen have penetrated what is supposed to be a military exclusion zone in Serbia stretching three miles back from the boundary with Kosovo.</p> <p>The zone was set up by Nato in 1999 to keep the Yugoslav army away from Kosovo. But the UCPMB has used it as a spring board for attacks on Serbian security forces.</p> <p>\"These three municipalities were under Kosovo's administration until 1956 and they should again be under Kosovo's administration. No other agreement will be taken into consideration,\" said Commander Rama.</p> <p>\"We are ready to achieve our goals, the army will have the last say.\"</p> <p>Additional British and Norwegian troops have been sent to back up the US soldiers in the area, but their patrols appear to have had a limited impact.</p> <p>Commander Rama said the numbers of recruits had increased ever since the rebels took over a key Albanian village after Serbian police withdrew from the area under the November ceasefire agreement.</p> <p>\"There have been more volunteers since the raising of the flag in Ternovac. Now we are in the position that we have too many soldiers and we are sending them elsewhere to be trained.\"</p> <p>US army officers have estimated that in this corridor the number of Albanian fighters is between 500 and 800, stretching along a 25-mile stretch of land. The Karaduku camp commanders say it is closer to 3,000. Neither estimate can be independently confirmed.</p> <p>Commander Rama admitted that supplies of food and weapons from Kosovo were becoming more restricted, due to K-for patrols.</p> <p>Trains of mules now had to bring in food from deeper inside Serbia. But in the two days I had access to the camp, supplies were brought in by car and mule both days.</p> <p>While most trainees go home, the commander said, some are sent on operations and some stay to become instructors. Their ages range from mid-teens to men in their forties. Their clothes are a mix of Swiss, Belgian, Italian and American fatigues and anything that's green.</p> <p>Most are equipped with semi-automatic rifles, many of the butts carved with the letters UCK, the initials of the formally disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army. A small number of men had mortars and heavy calibre machine guns.</p> <p>Spirits were high as soldiers sang songs to the tune of the US marines' chants.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British troops were shot at by Kosovo Albanians yesterday on the boundary with Serbia. The soldiers, part of the K-for peacekeeping force in Kosovo, were trying to prevent the flow of men and weapons to and from the province. The patrol from the first battalion, the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, challenged a group of 10 armed men crossing from Serbia into Kosovo. The gang responded by firing two shots and running off. Nobody was hurt. Those who recruit and train the gunmen say they are preparing for a new offensive. Tension on the boundary has increased since K-for stepped up its patrols in October after ethnic Albanian militiamen, some of them disgruntled former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, began trying to take over three Albanian towns in southern Serbia. On Wednesday the British commander in the area, Lieutenant-Colonel Stephen Kilpatrick, met leaders of the rebel bands to try to avoid just such an incident. But while K-for tries to keep a lid on the situation, Belgrade fumes at the Albanian attempt on Serbian territory, and local people grow more apprehensive, the rebels are busy training more fighters. A ceasefire agreed in November is only just holding. At a training camp in the area, the two men in charge - who gave their names as Commander Zola and Commander Rama - said they had trained up to 600 volunteers in 10 months. The camp belongs to a group calling itself the Karadaku brigade. The commanders disputed the US estimate of the current Albanian fighting force in this sector, saying it was four or five times greater. Whatever the truth about the numbers of gunmen, the continued existence of the training camp shows that the Nato-led peacekeeping force has been unable to stop the rebel movement, though its action has put some constraints on the commanders. The camp lies in the hills near the boundary with Kosovo and border with Macedonia. It is away from the eyes of Yugoslav troops and Serb police, to whom the area is off-limits, under the terms agreed with Nato. Up to 60 recruits are in the camp at any time and are given a month of basic training. \"Then they go home and wait, so they are ready for when the fighting starts,\" Commander Rama said. \"We are preparing for war but are always ready to give a chance to diplomacy. War will happen when everything else fails.\" The recruitment goes on while K-for tries to foster talks between local Albanian leaders and the Yugoslav government. \"Currently we are under a peace agreement,\" said Commander Rama. \"All the same, our warriors are getting trained and armed to be ready for an offensive to get the Serbs out of this area.\" The rebel movement in this corner of Kosovo and Serbia emerged in February last year. It wants independence for three Albanian populated towns in southern Serbia, and names itself after them, the liberation army of Presevo Medvedja, and Bujanovac, (UCPMB). Its existence has become a real embarrassment to K-for, because the gunmen have penetrated what is supposed to be a military exclusion zone in Serbia stretching three miles back from the boundary with Kosovo. The zone was set up by Nato in 1999 to keep the Yugoslav army away from Kosovo. But the UCPMB has used it as a spring board for attacks on Serbian security forces. \"These three municipalities were under Kosovo's administration until 1956 and they should again be under Kosovo's administration. No other agreement will be taken into consideration,\" said Commander Rama. \"We are ready to achieve our goals, the army will have the last say.\" Additional British and Norwegian troops have been sent to back up the US soldiers in the area, but their patrols appear to have had a limited impact. Commander Rama said the numbers of recruits had increased ever since the rebels took over a key Albanian village after Serbian police withdrew from the area under the November ceasefire agreement. \"There have been more volunteers since the raising of the flag in Ternovac. Now we are in the position that we have too many soldiers and we are sending them elsewhere to be trained.\" US army officers have estimated that in this corridor the number of Albanian fighters is between 500 and 800, stretching along a 25-mile stretch of land. The Karaduku camp commanders say it is closer to 3,000. Neither estimate can be independently confirmed. Commander Rama admitted that supplies of food and weapons from Kosovo were becoming more restricted, due to K-for patrols. Trains of mules now had to bring in food from deeper inside Serbia. But in the two days I had access to the camp, supplies were brought in by car and mule both days. While most trainees go home, the commander said, some are sent on operations and some stay to become instructors. Their ages range from mid-teens to men in their forties. Their clothes are a mix of Swiss, Belgian, Italian and American fatigues and anything that's green. Most are equipped with semi-automatic rifles, many of the butts carved with the letters UCK, the initials of the formally disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army. A small number of men had mortars and heavy calibre machine guns. Spirits were high as soldiers sang songs to the tune of the US marines' chants.",

No, last year was the worst for American movies since the end of the silent era, according to a straw poll of critics in USA Today, the nation's largest-circulation newspaper. </p> <p> Never mind that some seemed to recall similar judgments being delivered every year about this time and that the public didn't appear to notice the dearth of quality: a new record was set at the box office in 2000 - $7.46bn, an increase of 2% - but then a new record was set in each 12-month period throughout the past decade. </p> <p> Two of the movies exempted from this derision, Almost Famous and Wonder Boys, have at least three things in common: they didn't make much money; they, and their stars, are being talked about for Oscars; and, finally, the woman in blue denims recommending the pancakes in a cafe above a supermarket on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. </p> <p> Frances McDormand knows all about the opening skirmishes of the movie prize-giving season but will just as readily discuss motherhood, playgrounds and schools, the way chain stores and shopping malls are stifling diversity, and what happens to the neighbourhood when you can't find a launderette. Then there's the mortgage that needs to be paid. </p> <p> \"Guess what?\" she asks rhetorically, in the manner favoured by New Yorkers. \"I am an ordinary person. And when I fart in a minute, you'll know I am.\" She and her husband Joel, one half of the film-making Coen brothers, threw a party the night before and she breaks off every so often to exchange small talk or greet a friend passing through the coffee shop. \"See you, hon.\" </p> <p> But not so many ordinary people have won an Oscar (for her part as the pregnant police chief in the Coens' Fargo) or have been nominated for a Golden Globe (for her part as the mother of the impossibly young rock writer in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous - she was beaten by co-star Kate Hudson). \"It's like all those awards things. It's the movie social season, it's the time when everybody celebrates that they're in the business. It's interesting for us because we don't live there.\" </p> <p> She means that she and Coen inhabit neither the physical Hollywood, nor its machine. And no, she does not need awards to fuel her ego or her self-esteem. \"I'm really proud of my work, of all the movies that I've made in the last year. It's nice when you make a movie and other people think the same thing and you're not deluding yourself. But it's also the case that I already knew it.\"</p> <p> She also knows bullshit when she sees it, and says so - she greets the observation that she once shared an apartment with fellow Oscar-winner Holly Hunter with the inquiry: \"What's so amazing about that?\" \"Confidence? No, I've just got that perspective. Been doing it for 20 years. I think awards are good for the movie. They can bring a new audience to the movie. I've always claimed that things like that don't get you work. Work gets you work. That's my blue-collar protestant work ethic.\" </p> <p> Graduates of Yale are not usually remarkable for their blue-collar work ethic, protestant or otherwise. \"Yale? I was at Yale on a scholarship. I guess it shouldn't be a sensitive subject after all this time, should it?\" </p> <p> \"All this time\" started 43 years ago, when a preacher and his wife had a baby and they called her Frances. The family lived in Illinois, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee before coming to a halt in Pennsylvania when she was eight. McDormand moved to New York City after finishing at Yale School of Drama, and her second job, in 1984, was a lead role in a low-budget thriller directed by a couple of first-time film-makers: the Coen brothers' Blood Simple. </p> <p> Since then, she has worked in television and theatre, notably A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway and, 10 years later, in Dublin. Two years ago, she co-starred with Billy Crudup in an off-Broadway production of Oedipus. On screen, she is most closely identified with the films made by her husband and his brother Ethan, even if she has appeared in only three of them, unless you include an uncredited bit part in Miller's Crossing; the other was Raising Arizona. Other roles include that of a Klansman's wife in Mississippi Burning - another Oscar nomination - a human rights activist in Ken Loach's contentious Northern Ireland drama Hidden Agenda, Tim Robbins's lover in the Robert Altman triumph Short Cuts, and a football-mad divorcee in John Sayles's Lone Star. </p> <p> It is a hallmark of her work that you tend to come away from it full of admiration for an actress who is an essential part of the fabric without being the movie itself. Rarely do you feel that you have just seen a Frances McDormand movie: she says that, even in Fargo, hers was never intended as the central role.</p> <p> \"I don't think of myself as a movie star and I can pretty easily convince other people that I'm not a movie star. I love it, and this happens rarely, but I'm at the grocery store or I'm on the subway and someone says, 'What are you doing here?' and I say 'I'm going to work' or 'I'm buying my groceries, for God's sake. What do you mean what am I doing here?' It's partly the way I look but it's also the characters I play. It's all pretty familiar and it's all pretty acceptable. There's nothing mysterious about any of them or off-putting. I've never played a psycho killer, although I'd love to.\" </p> <p> Movies, says McDormand, will never give her the same charge as the theatre, and she has been back at Yale recently talking to drama students, exchanging her experience for their energy and lack of cynicism. \"It's a scary thing going into the workforce with a $50,000 debt and you've been trained as a classical theatre actor. There's always a depression in the theatre. There's only two givens with choosing acting as a profession: one is you will always be unemployed, always, and it doesn't matter how much money you make, you're still always going to be unemployed; and that you have no power. The only power you have is the word no.\" McDormand says that it is a word she uses often and never regrets. \"I forget about 'em. No, no, no, no, no. I don't hold on to them. It can't be about regret or I wouldn't have chosen this job.\" </p> <p> She wishes, though, that some people would use the power a little more often, not being a great admirer of big stars who chose to slum it for a spell on the stage, giving a grateful public their Hamlet, for instance. \"It's bullshit. Even though I'm an actor, I've gone to productions where there has been someone whose work is known in film and you can't take your eyes off them. It unbalances the production. Whether they're good or not, it doesn't matter.\" </p> <p> McDormand is not a creature of the gossip columns, a mainstay of much of the New York press, but Coen brothers films have a long shelf-life and, no matter how elusive her lustre, that Oscar must confer some sort of celebrity. Wrong again. \"You know what? Here's what I have at my advantage: I've never been a personality. I've always been a character actor. I think it's also about people not knowing who I am.\" </p> <p> She is, among other things, someone who appreciates a knowledgeable audience in the theatre. Dublin? \"Great. They have a steady exposure to it and it's about education.\" New York? \"Here it's about being able to say who you saw and what you did, not the experience. I sat behind these two women the other night in the theatre and, granted, it wasn't a great production but it was an interesting production. And they got up in the middle of the act to go to the bathroom, rustle, rustle, they were looking at their fingernails during the play, they were commenting on the age of one of the actresses on stage. I mean, what are you doing here? It was astounding.\" </p> <p> This is not the sort of behaviour one would expect from either of the characters she plays in Wonder Boys (an academic involved in an extra-marital affair) or Almost Famous (a mother who is also an academic).</p> <p> Cameron Crowe's film is based on his time as a juvenile rock writer who goes on the road for Rolling Stone in the early 1970s. The McDormand role is the vehicle for some of its funniest and most touching moments. Naturally, she is concerned for the boy, but even back then, only the absurdly over-protective could have seen Satan in Simon and Garfunkel. </p> <p> \"It's really fascinating; it's not about rock'n'roll, it's about innocence, and it's a lot about journalism. There's nothing controversial about the movie, there's no real hard edges, there's no real deep pits. But, hey, not every movie needs that. It's a good story well told. </p> <p> \"It's not nostalgic, because it's more immediate than that. You know when the kid flips through those albums? I can't tell you how many, and it was great, it's like guys my age were on the verge of tears when Cream comes up and it's 'My God! duh, duh...' It tells so much. Within the realms of female archetypes - there's the mom, there's the daughter, there's the sister, there's the girlfriend - within that, it was a great role.\" </p> <p> But McDormand has her mind set on something beyond the secondary parts in which she has had so much success. \"I haven't had that challenge in movies hardly ever, only in the theatre, where the thrust of the story is about the female character. I'd like to try that. But then I have to be available for that, too. It's much easier to play supporting roles because that's what I do in my life: I support my son.\" Until then, there is a month's work on a movie directed by Michael Caton-Jones and, later in the year, a stage production of Phaedra with the Soho avant-garde theatre company the Wooster Group. Right now, though, she must get back to six-year-old Pedro. And, no, McDormand never did follow through on her threat to deploy the effect that would prove just how ordinary she really is. </p> <p>\u0095 Almost Famous is released on February 9.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Actress Sally Field (pictured) is to become only the third woman in the history of the American Society of Cinematographers to receive its prestigious Board of Governors Award. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Field will follow in the footsteps of Jodie Foster and Fay Kanin. The award, the only prize which the ASC presents to people who are not cinematographers, is intended to recognise individuals who make \"significant and enduring contributions to advancing the art of filmmaking.\" The award will be presented during the 15th annual ASC Outstanding Achievement Awards ceremony on February 18. \u0095 Elliott Gould is the latest actor to be added to the starry cast of Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven, according to Michael Fleming in Variety. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon have already signed up for the much-hyped remake of the ratpack classic. Gould will play Ruben Tischkoff, the man who finances Danny Ocean's casino heist. \u0095 Actor-director Edward Burns and supermodel Christy Turlington have announced their engagement, according to ananova. The couple, both 32, had just ended relationships with other people when they met. Burns and actress Heather Graham broke up last spring, just before Turlington's six-year relationship with actor Jason Patric ended. Burns, who has been acclaimed for She's the One and The Brothers McMullen, has a new movie, 15 Minutes, coming out in May.",

But it is a dirty war, and a war in which, according to Christopher Hitchens, they have repeatedly found themselves on the wrong side. </p> <p>Steven Soderbergh's watchable, ambitious, multi-storyline, multi-ethnic movie about the drug trade is adapted from the 1989 Channel 4 drama series Traffik, about the trade route from Pakistan to Germany and England. Soderbergh and his producers, Edward Zwick, Marshall Herskovitz and Laura Bickford have imported this racy stuff from Europe but cut it with quite a bit of pro- American schmaltz. </p> <p>It's now the Mexican Connection: two infinitely wealthy, infinitely violent Tijuana cartels are at war over the exclusive prerogative of exporting under-the-counter analgesics to Tio Sam in the form of solid cocaine-dolls called Spastic Jacks. Meanwhile their Californian connection is taken in by the DEA and the new White House-appointed drugs tsar, frowningly played by Michael Douglas, finds that his own daughter is an end user. But despite an apparent equivalence of moral squalor between Mexico and the United States, Traffic makes it subtly clear that the official corruption is all happening south of the Rio Grande; the worst that the Americans are guilty of is a surfeit of innocence. </p> <p>Naivety aside, Traffic demonstrates a big, bold HBO-isation of the big screen. For some time, the subtlety and sophistication of shows like The Sopranos and Larry Sanders, with their ability to develop characters and plots over hours and hours of broadcast time, has been thought to represent a serious challenge to the movies. Traffic looks like a response to this - and a very dynamic and energetic response. It differs from \"portfolio\" movies like Short Cuts or Pulp Fiction, in looking like a giant, strenuous compression of the sort of far-reaching, intermingling storylines more familiar from the small screen, and in which the denouement feels a lot like a \"series finale\". </p> <p>The movie's undoubted star is Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez, a harassed underpaid street cop in Tijuana, already mired in the venal business of back- handers over parking violations. But he and his partner Manolo (Jacob Vargas) are doing an eye-catchingly honest job in tackling drug felons and attract the attention of the sinister General Salazar, played by Tomas Milian, who co-opts them into his own ruthless theatre of operations in the drug war. This is a riveting performance from Del Toro: understated, flintily tough, reticent and, finally, infinitely weary and battle scarred. </p> <p>Meanwhile, over the border, their equivalents are the DEA foot soldiers played by Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle who dream of the ultimate prize: \"busting white people\". And when their team busts a top-ranking white person, his haughty trophy wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is astonished by what her husband has actually been doing to keep her in the style to which she has become extensively accustomed. This is a rather stately, proprietorial performance from Ms Zeta-Jones, who, according to the publicity material, used her \"own accent\" for the film: a cultured English-American. </p> <p>But at the apex of Wasp self-deception is Michael Douglas as Judge Robert Wakefield, the anti-drugs supremo unable to face up to the fact that his pampered, preppie daughter Caroline, played by Erika Christensen, is a serious addict. The scene in which she is getting high with her unspeakably spoilt rich friends is a black comic gem: one of them collapses with a life-threatening fit and they all shrug and giggle and finally panic, rowing over whose father to call. \"Your dad's a doctor !\" \"He's a doctor in sequencing the pig genome!\" </p> <p>Caroline eventually disappears into the street-cauldron and Michael Douglas goes on a George C Scott Hardcore-type quest to find her among the exotic drug dens. Soderbergh appears to be inviting us to consider his eventual reunion with her, and support for her therapy programme, as the morally redemptive centre of this big complex film. </p> <p>It's a bit suspect. Traffic aspires to show a total vision of drugs, and yet the only actual users shown are The Kids: whereas we all know the users are The Adults, too: blue-collar and white-collar, lawyers, truck-drivers, cops and, erm, movie folk. It would be a bit cheeky for Hollywood to sell us a straightforward anti-drugs line, and Traffic ostentatiously doesn't do that, its teeming 147 minutes favouring neither the crackdown hawks nor the decriminalisation doves. The movie appears to content itself with anatomising the huge geopolitical hypocrisy of it all. </p> <p>But to work as an exposure of hypocrisy, its geopolitical assumptions have to be a lot less loaded than this. Persistently, Mexico is shown as corrupt in a way the US evidently isn't: the Mexican cops and army are on the take; the DEA and American political establishment are not. Everything down Mexico way is photographed in a burning, flickering, hellish glow, whereas high-tone Georgetown in Washington DC is filmed neutrally, while Michael Douglas gets his straight-A offspring tearfully back on the straight and narrow. </p> <p>Well, the evasions and confusions can't cancel-out the fact that this is an entertaining piece of storytelling, handled with real chutzpah by Soderbergh, who is not merely out of the wilderness, but top of the A-list with a flurry of classy, commercially plausible movies: Out of Sight, The Limey, Erin Brockovich and now this. He will surely pick up an Academy award this spring, and leapfrog his way up the director's power list.</p>",

Well, the evasions and confusions can't cancel-out the fact that this is an entertaining piece of storytelling, handled with real chutzpah by Soderbergh, who is not merely out of the wilderness, but top of the A-list with a flurry of classy, commercially plausible movies: Out of Sight, The Limey, Erin Brockovich and now this. He will surely pick up an Academy award this spring, and leapfrog his way up the director's power list.",

      "bodyText": "In a happy accident of scheduling, US audiences this week were blessed to receive not only the third directorial effort from the first Mr Ciccone, but also Snatch, the second film from the very latest Mr Ciccone. Having seen Snatch in preview late last year, my timing was scrambled by the time of the official release, and it's only now that I've noticed just how cunningly those nuptials were timed to maximise the movie's US box office. Apparently I retain one shred of naivety after all. Still, it reached number four, not bad in a chart still boasting several long-haul Christmas heavyweights. But it raises one serious, ugly question: will Ritchie really find a place for his new missus in his next movie? Will he overcome the obstacles that thwarted Sean Penn and even Warren Beatty when it came to making the charisma-lite Material Girl into a film star? Will he help her surpass both Shanghai Surprise and Body of Evidence? But should we care? If the woman had any brains she'd never have co-sponsored Evita or The Next Best Thing.

The day provides one sort of answer to the question of how Holocaust denial can be challenged. Instead of legislation to make it illegal, a Memorial Day aims to supply the educational tools with which Holocaust denial can be countered. </p> <p>Yet though I understand the motives, I'm not persuaded by the methods. Is an institutionalised day the best way of remembering an event? It's one thing in Israel where Yom Hashoah, the annual day of Holocaust remembrance is, for obvious reasons, an important part of collective mourning. But in Britain, whose connection with the Shoah is less direct, institutionalising the day may actually serve to promote the process of forgetting. </p> <p>The Holocaust scholar James Young, writing about Holocaust memorials, has argued that \"once we assign monumental form to memory, we have to some degree divested ourselves of the obligation to remember. In shouldering the memory-work, monuments may relieve viewers of their memory burden\". The recent debate about the statuary in Trafalgar Square is proof. Drained of vitality, they've become empty tributes to the institutionalised great and good. </p> <p>Even in Israel, Yom Hashoah doesn't have the shared, universal meaning which a national day of commemoration is designed to create. Sephardic immigrants and Arab-Israelis have different, almost certainly dissonant, memories and reactions, not unlike the black Bronx schoolchildren who cheered when they watched Schindler's List. </p> <p>I fear the shared sanctimony which a Holocaust Memorial Day will inevitably bring. Even in the Department for Education and Employment education pack, although prepared by an impressive team of Holocaust educators and well-informed, the platitudes are inescapable. The Spielberg agenda of using the Holocaust to teach liberal values is strongly in evidence. Of course children should be taught to challenge racism and appreciate difference, yet I feel seriously discomfited by the notion of lessons to be learnt from the Holocaust. </p> <p>The historian Peter Novick has argued that \"If there are, in fact, lessons to be learnt from history, the Holocaust would seem an unlikely source... because of its extremity. Lessons for dealing with the sorts of issues that confront us in ordinary life, public or private, are not likely to be found in this most extraordinary of events\". By all means teach children to cherish each other, but why have recourse to the Holocaust to do so? </p> <p>Bracketing the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides with the Shoah - as the Holocaust Memorial Day does - is equally problematic. Not because it disturbs the notion of the Holocaust's uniqueness (that most spurious and sterile of debates), but because it's doubtful that the factors which these distinct atrocities share can be boiled down to a set of neat, progressive maxims. </p> <p>One assumes that Holocaust Memorial Day will be primarily directed at children. But what of their parents and grandparents? Let's not forget that anti-Semitism actually increased in Britain during the second world war, with many sharing the Joyce Grenfell belief that \"there's something a bit un-cosy about a non-Aryan refugee in one's kitchen\". </p> <p>And if we're to have an annual Holocaust commemoration, it shouldn't idealise the British government either, whose policy on pre-war refugees and post-war survivors was pitted with prejudice and self-interest. </p> <p>Above all, I'm sceptical about a Holocaust Memorial Day because it arrives on a wave of Holocaust material. In a dizzyingly short period, a 50-year near silence has turned into an omnipresent obsession. Both distort, and each serves current social needs. As a culture we've become grave-robbers, raiding the past for the ethical meanings - of good and evil - which the present can't supply, and which shouldn't be imposed upon the Shoah. </p> <p>That said, the day is here and must be used. When the Holocaust was first included in the national curriculum, it stimulated the creation of a mass of effective new educational materials. The memorial day may do the same. As a daughter of survivors, I also hope that survivors and refugees will be involved in public speaking - they constitute the best educational aid of all. </p> <p>At my most optimistic, I think the day might enhance sensitive teaching about the Holocaust. And yet I worry that, by creating the conditions through which it becomes part of official rhetoric, we risk desensitising future generations to the Shoah. In 50 years' time, will there be schools full of children chafing at having to feign sorrow over a distant historical atrocity? Can you mandate collective memory? </p> <p>\u0095 Anne Karpf is a journalist, Jewish Chronicle columnist, and author of The War After: Living With The Holocaust, (Minerva). </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The Spielberg agenda of using the Holocaust to teach liberal values is strongly in evidence. Of course children should be taught to challenge racism and appreciate difference, yet I feel seriously discomfited by the notion of lessons to be learnt from the Holocaust. The historian Peter Novick has argued that \"If there are, in fact, lessons to be learnt from history, the Holocaust would seem an unlikely source... because of its extremity. Lessons for dealing with the sorts of issues that confront us in ordinary life, public or private, are not likely to be found in this most extraordinary of events\". By all means teach children to cherish each other, but why have recourse to the Holocaust to do so? Bracketing the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides with the Shoah - as the Holocaust Memorial Day does - is equally problematic. Not because it disturbs the notion of the Holocaust's uniqueness (that most spurious and sterile of debates), but because it's doubtful that the factors which these distinct atrocities share can be boiled down to a set of neat, progressive maxims. One assumes that Holocaust Memorial Day will be primarily directed at children. But what of their parents and grandparents? Let's not forget that anti-Semitism actually increased in Britain during the second world war, with many sharing the Joyce Grenfell belief that \"there's something a bit un-cosy about a non-Aryan refugee in one's kitchen\". And if we're to have an annual Holocaust commemoration, it shouldn't idealise the British government either, whose policy on pre-war refugees and post-war survivors was pitted with prejudice and self-interest. Above all, I'm sceptical about a Holocaust Memorial Day because it arrives on a wave of Holocaust material. In a dizzyingly short period, a 50-year near silence has turned into an omnipresent obsession. Both distort, and each serves current social needs. As a culture we've become grave-robbers, raiding the past for the ethical meanings - of good and evil - which the present can't supply, and which shouldn't be imposed upon the Shoah. That said, the day is here and must be used. When the Holocaust was first included in the national curriculum, it stimulated the creation of a mass of effective new educational materials. The memorial day may do the same. As a daughter of survivors, I also hope that survivors and refugees will be involved in public speaking - they constitute the best educational aid of all. At my most optimistic, I think the day might enhance sensitive teaching about the Holocaust. And yet I worry that, by creating the conditions through which it becomes part of official rhetoric, we risk desensitising future generations to the Shoah. In 50 years' time, will there be schools full of children chafing at having to feign sorrow over a distant historical atrocity? Can you mandate collective memory? \u0095 Anne Karpf is a journalist, Jewish Chronicle columnist, and author of The War After: Living With The Holocaust, (Minerva). comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Sexual health charities have spoken out against a House of Lords initiative to deny Britain's women over-the-counter access to the morning after pill, a measure only recently introduced. The Family Planning Association has slammed the move, saying that peers would be guilty of \"an extraordinary attack on women's health\" by voting for such a proposal. A spokesman for the Brook Advisory Centre said: \"We hope the Lords won't reverse the government's decision. It would be a huge step backwards and there's no good reason for the decision to be reversed.\" Lady Young, the Tory former leader of the Lords, has tabled a motion calling for immediate quashing of the decision to make the emergency contraception available to women aged over 16 at all chemists, instead of on prescription, which came into effect on January 1. Peers will vote on the procedural order on Monday, and, if they back it, will succeed in immediately quashing the order permitting over-the-counter sale. Last night, the Department of Health warned: \"It will be a major step backwards and pharmacies would have to be alerted immediately to shop sales of a safe and effective emergency form of hormonal contraception.\" The pill would still be available on prescription but the immediacy - important if the drug, which can be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, is to be most effective - would be lost. Women \"should be able to access emergency contraception as quickly as possible for it to be most effective\", added its spokeswoman, Juliet Hillier. \"We hope that the Lords will recognise this and vote against Lady Young's motion.\" Lady Young, who led the campaign against the bill lowering the gay age of consent to 16, and successfully persuaded peers to back her and reject the change before the government used the Parliament Act to force it on the statute books, was last night unavailable for comment. She also last year successfully led opposition to the government's bid to scrap clause 28 which bans the promotion of homosexuality in schools. But the Tories, who tired to halt the decision in the Commons, will back her and could secure a victory if the Lib-Dems decide not to support the government, or if a Labour-Lib-Dem coalition fails to turn out in sufficient numbers. The Tories' criticism of the government's decision has been unremitting, with the shadow health secretary Dr Liam Fox telling the Nursing Standard on Wednesday: \"My worry is not about the ability of pharmacists but about whether the high street chemist is the appropriate place for it to be given.\"",

In the case of Obukhov, the Russian newspaper quoted the Tomlinson book as saying that \"Spencer\" continued to meet the junior Russian diplomat on a bi-monthly basis in Tallin, then later in Moscow until Russian counter-intelligence arrested Obukhov in Moscow in April 1996. A writer of pulp spy novels who has been in psychiatric care and whose relatives and lawyers said he was a schizophrenic, Obukhov is the son of Alexei Obukhov who was deputy Soviet foreign minister to Eduard Shevardnadze in the Gorbachev era. After Obukhov was arrested, triggering the tit for tat spy row, the Moscow city court found him unfit to stand trial and ordered compulsory psychiatric treatment which he received from 1997 until July last year when he was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. Last month an appeal court overruled the 11-year sentence and Obukhov now faces a new hearing.",

Sponsorship experts believe the Big Brother 2 package may be sold for up to \u00a35m as Channel 4 promises more sex appeal from the new series. The broadcaster says it is already talking with potential sponsors amid rumours that C4 bosses will pick contestants most likely to have sex on the show. Nick Theakston, head of broadcast at MediaVest, which negotiated Southern Comfort's original sponsorship, said he thought the sponsorship would go for \"at least \u00a33-4m\". The deal is likely to exceed Alliance &amp; Leicester's \u00a33m tie-up with ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, announced this week, and run second only to Cadbury's \u00a310m backing of Coronation Street. Southern Comfort, \u00a31m sponsor of the first series, is still considering whether it can afford to bid for the second. The new series is expected to smash the 4.7m audience attracted by the first outing, while the profile of viewers is the advertiser's \"holy grail\" - upmarket 16 to 34-year-olds. This makes it particularly attractive to high-spending youth brands such as beers, soft drinks and computer games. \"The success of Big Brother 1 is obvious.

      "bodyText": "A mixed race English family has been flown to Africa to live in a mud hut without electricity or running water for an upcoming factual series for Channel 4. The family of five from south London will have to live in a rural village in Swaziland for three months for the show, African Village, which is being made by UK indie RDF Television. The two adults and three children are taking a full part in village life, with the grown-ups going out to work and their offspring attending the local school. The mother, who is a nurse back in Britain, is working alongside the other village women washing and working on the land. Her partner, a lorry driver back home, is looking for a driving job. Their eldest child, a 13-year-old boy, has to walk 9km to school each morning. The schoolteachers have big sticks they are not afraid to use, according to the show's executive producer, RDF director of programmes Stephen Lambert. Mr Lambert said the wife was already fed up because local custom meant her husband got hot baths but she didn't, even though she has been out working on the land. \"Swaziland has a very traditional African society with an absolute monarchy,\" he added. \"They still have very strong social structures and consider foreigners to be quite inferior.\" The series gives a new twist to the reality TV genre, which has included Channel 4 shows 1900 House and 1940s House. African Village is being series produced and directed by Helen Richards, who is working on location in Swaziland with a five-strong RDF production team. The three-part series is due to go out on Channel 4 in the autumn.",

It's the way they lived.\" </p> <p>The Duchess of Devonshire told her visitors she hated seeing (in TV costume dramas) servants hanging around behind chairs, bobbing and curtsying, saying Ma'am and Miss all the time. \"She said that they were much more functional, just there, and not so precious,\" says Harwood. \"She was also very adamant that at coming-out balls (there's one for the central character, Linda), the girls, only 18 or 19 years old, would wear a string of pearls at most, not jewels.\" </p> <p>The key challenge for Moggach was what to do about Lord Alconleigh - Uncle Matthew - who is, by modern standards, totally beyond the pale in his ravings and prejudices. But the team were adamant he shouldn't be edited down to a shadow. Uncle Matthew was a very close portrait of the real Mitford father, and the Duchess confirmed that he was very fond of the books. </p> <p>Harwood says \"You'd be amazed at how few people can play such parts.

      "body": "<p>The controversy over the exact circumstances in which a billionaire Indian businessman applied for a British passport threatened to engulf a second government minister last night as the scope of the official inquiry was widened to embrace the entire nine-year saga.</p> <p>Keith Vaz, Europe minister, became embroiled in the controversy that ruined Peter Mandelson when the Conservatives tabled a clutch of parliamentary questions about his involvement with the controversial Hinduja brothers.</p> <p>The investigation, by former Treasury solicitor Anthony Hammond QC, will include letters written by Mr Vaz to the Home Office asking about progress on the applications for UK passports from SP Hinduja and his brother GP Hinduja.</p> <p>Sir Anthony promised Downing Street a report on the affair within \"weeks not months\", before the expected May general election. The QC started reading key documents yesterday amid a welter of new allegations.</p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, last night ordered his officials to check official records for his contacts with the Hindujas. The Tories also demanded to know why Mr Vaz, described by Downing Street as \"an important point of contact with the Asian community\", had written to Mr Blair or Mr Mandelson about the Indian tycoons. The Hindujas are not his constituents.</p> <p>\"What are the full contents of Mr Vaz's representations on their behalf?\" asked William Hague, who raised the campaign stakes further with a fresh personal attack on Tony Blair's role. The prime minister could not distance himself from \"a culture of spin, cronyism, dishonesty and deceit\" by sacking his Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Hague said, \"because the values he represents are still there\" in the shape of Mr Blair himself.</p> <p>It was confirmed that Mr Vaz, MP for Leicester East, a Goan Catholic who is Britain's first ethnic Asian minister, did write letters to the Home Office asking about progress on the applications for UK passports from SP and GP Hinduja.</p> <p>Mr Vaz said last night he was \"very relaxed\" about the affair, but would not comment further because of the inquiry.</p> <p>Sir Anthony will read Mr Vaz's letters, as well as any relevant correspondence dating back to the brothers' first, abortive application in 1990. No 10 confirmed that the QC's terms of reference will allow him to range over the whole 1990-99 period.</p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP whose Commons questions elicited Mr Mandelson's weekend evasion - which cost him his political career on Wednesday - established last night that both brothers were turned down for a UK passport in 1990, apparently because they had not spent enough time in Britain. By then the first allegations of corruption involving a huge arms deal in India had surfaced. The pair made inquiries again in 1994 but were warned by the then Tory immigration minister, Charles Wardle, that he could not help them.</p> <p>It also emerged that the Hindujas threw a party in honour of Mr Hague, and the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath served as a trustee on a research institute founded by the brothers.</p> <p>The party, which was held after Mr Hague became Tory leader in 1997, was designed to give him a chance to meet members of the Asian community, according to Surina Narula, a leading Asian Tory. A Tory spokesman declined to comment.</p> <p>Jack Straw, the home secretary, also told Mr Baker last night that GP Hinduja had successfully applied for a passport in March 1997, when John Major was still in power.

      "bodyText": "The controversy over the exact circumstances in which a billionaire Indian businessman applied for a British passport threatened to engulf a second government minister last night as the scope of the official inquiry was widened to embrace the entire nine-year saga. Keith Vaz, Europe minister, became embroiled in the controversy that ruined Peter Mandelson when the Conservatives tabled a clutch of parliamentary questions about his involvement with the controversial Hinduja brothers. The investigation, by former Treasury solicitor Anthony Hammond QC, will include letters written by Mr Vaz to the Home Office asking about progress on the applications for UK passports from SP Hinduja and his brother GP Hinduja. Sir Anthony promised Downing Street a report on the affair within \"weeks not months\", before the expected May general election. The QC started reading key documents yesterday amid a welter of new allegations. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, last night ordered his officials to check official records for his contacts with the Hindujas. The Tories also demanded to know why Mr Vaz, described by Downing Street as \"an important point of contact with the Asian community\", had written to Mr Blair or Mr Mandelson about the Indian tycoons. The Hindujas are not his constituents. \"What are the full contents of Mr Vaz's representations on their behalf?\" asked William Hague, who raised the campaign stakes further with a fresh personal attack on Tony Blair's role. The prime minister could not distance himself from \"a culture of spin, cronyism, dishonesty and deceit\" by sacking his Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Hague said, \"because the values he represents are still there\" in the shape of Mr Blair himself. It was confirmed that Mr Vaz, MP for Leicester East, a Goan Catholic who is Britain's first ethnic Asian minister, did write letters to the Home Office asking about progress on the applications for UK passports from SP and GP Hinduja. Mr Vaz said last night he was \"very relaxed\" about the affair, but would not comment further because of the inquiry. Sir Anthony will read Mr Vaz's letters, as well as any relevant correspondence dating back to the brothers' first, abortive application in 1990. No 10 confirmed that the QC's terms of reference will allow him to range over the whole 1990-99 period. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP whose Commons questions elicited Mr Mandelson's weekend evasion - which cost him his political career on Wednesday - established last night that both brothers were turned down for a UK passport in 1990, apparently because they had not spent enough time in Britain. By then the first allegations of corruption involving a huge arms deal in India had surfaced. The pair made inquiries again in 1994 but were warned by the then Tory immigration minister, Charles Wardle, that he could not help them. It also emerged that the Hindujas threw a party in honour of Mr Hague, and the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath served as a trustee on a research institute founded by the brothers. The party, which was held after Mr Hague became Tory leader in 1997, was designed to give him a chance to meet members of the Asian community, according to Surina Narula, a leading Asian Tory. A Tory spokesman declined to comment. Jack Straw, the home secretary, also told Mr Baker last night that GP Hinduja had successfully applied for a passport in March 1997, when John Major was still in power. He got his passport later that year under Labour. SP Hinduja applied again on October 20 1998, days after the Hinduja donation to the dome's faith zone was confirmed. Though he denies any improper pressure, Mr Mandelson's brief call to Mr O'Brien came in late June, after the Hindujas had offered up to \u00a33m. It was Mr Mandelson's initial claim that his private secretary had made the fateful call that led to his resignation.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of French workers went on strike yesterday in protest against a scheme which threatens their pensions and undermines their right to retire at 60. Many urban areas were engulfed in chaos as trains, buses and domestic flights were cancelled as a result of the one-day action. There were demonstrations in 65 cities. In Lille, firefighters who took to the streets to protest about pensions and the lack of resources for meeting safety standards clashed with riot police and sprayed them with foam. One fireman had to have his hand amputated after one of the many teargas and stun grenades the police fired to control the 600 protesters ripped off a finger and badly damaged the rest of the hand. Eight people were injured, mostly by teargas, the police added. Elsewhere the protests were less violent but equally disruptive. In the Nantes, teachers, police officers, rail workers and hospital staff took to the streets. Lyon, Montpellier and other cities were gridlocked throughout the day as those not on strike tried to drive to work. Union leaders have promised more concerted industrial action if the employers' federation, Medef, does not listen to their demands. They fear that under Medef's scheme 15m employees, most of them in the private sector, will have to continue working well into their 60s to collect a full pension. France's pension system is jointly managed by trade unions and employers. Employees contribute to a state-run minimum pension fund and to two top-up funds which guarantee better retirement packages. Medef is threatening to change the nature of these top-up funds unilaterally, saying that employees must continue working until they are 65 to receive the full rewards, to counter the rising cost of the system. The head of Medef, Ernest-Antoine Seilli\u00e8re, has long warned that unless people work longer the system will collapse when post-war baby boomers begin to retire later this decade. But Medef's decision comes at a time when the unions and the Socialists are pressing for a shorter working week and a better quality of life for employees. \"We live in a modern country which produces more and more wealth, so it is possible to make sure that life is not just systematically about work,\" Bernard Thibault, head of the CGT union, said. He has been backed by the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, who vowed that the state would step in to ensure that workers could continue to retire at 60. \"Contrary to what some people say, retirement at 60 is not a slogan or an outdated situation,\" he said. \"The government is following this issue carefully and will assume its responsibilities if necessary.\" Mr Jospin wants most of the country's labour force to work a maximum of 35 hours a week, as this could help the country reach his primary economic goal of full employment and bring a boom in the leisure industry. Medef's insistence that workers retire at 65 acts against the government's plans to cut unemployment. But a leader in today's Le Monde accuses the prime minister of taking on the employers' federation to court popularity for the forthcoming municipal elections. \"Indulging in polemics with Ernest-Antoine Seilli\u00e8re is just a diversion that does not go to the heart of the question which is this: is the French system of pensions in grave danger?\" it says Medef and the government are already at loggerheads over whether France should encourage economic migrants. The employers suggest that workers from abroad could fill the many manual vacancies; Mr Jospin is worried that this would undermine his full employment goal.",

But, as presented by Israeli politicians and as understood by the majority of electors, this campaign is about none of those things. Instead of debating peace, Israelis are lackadaisically turning over in their minds which of two ex-generals, both discredited in different ways, should hold the unenviable job of prime minister.</p> <p>Indeed, some say that this is the most boring campaign in Israeli political history. The degree of disinterest, according to Mark Heller of Tel Aviv University, an expert on the Israeli political scene, is unprecedented. With less than two weeks to go before the election, polls suggest up to 20% of the electors may not vote at all, either abstaining or casting a blank ballot. Evidence of voter participation, like bumper stickers on cars, neighbourhood meetings, and canvassing, is scant, and few are watching the political broadcasts on television.</p> <p>The reasons for this curiously vacuous response are partly to do with Israel's strange political system and partly with the country's failure to grasp that the relationship with the Palestinians has shifted radically in the past few months. The terms on which peace might be available have changed, yet Israel seems still to be living in a past when it had much greater influence over the way in which Palestinian aspirations were pursued. The polls show that Shimon Peres, who is not a candidate, would take more votes than Ehud Barak and might be able to beat Ariel Sharon.

The result instead was that prime ministers got their big majorities, but that the larger parties were undermined, to the point where the two biggest, Labour and Likud, cannot now even achieve a majority together. Israelis vote in a \"national\" frame of mind for the prime minister, but in an even more sectional way than before for the Knesset. Any Israeli prime minis ter now faces a cohabitation with chaos, as he tries to appease an unruly gaggle of secular, religious, and ethnic interests and the parties that represent them.

Whoever is elected - Barak, Sharon, or Peres, if he should replace Barak as candidate - will face the same unamanageable parliament, and will have little freedom of movement on any front. The likelihood is that general elections to choose both a new prime minister and a new Knesset will have to come soon, and these will certainly feature Binyamin Netanyahu, prevented from joining the present contest. In other words, more important choices are just down the road, so why bother overmuch with what are essentially interim decisions?</p> <p>This inclination is reinforced by the fact that there is little mainstream discussion in Israel of how best to work for peace. The consensus is that Barak offered the maximum possible, so now the problem lies on the Palestinian side. Israel has no op tion but to wait until the Palestinians come to their senses, a process assisted by tough Israeli military and economic measures. All Israeli leaders can do is to offer slight permutations of the Camp David proposals, as Barak is still doing in the talks in Taba, or propose an interim settlement, as Sharon says he plans to do. There is nothing that can be decided in an Israeli election campaign, on this argument, which will affect the fact that the only policy toward the Palestinians is to wait them out.</p> <p>Some, like the American analyst Anthony H Cordesman, suggest that this violence-strewn \"waiting\" could go on for years. The trouble with the waiting game is not only that it takes lives almost every day but that with each death this conflict becomes more entrenched, and the still not wholly dissipated little capital of trust between Israelis and Palestinians wastes away. Nor is there any guarantee that the violence can be stabilised at some particular level. There may be a joint interest, as Cordesman suggests, in avoiding \"excessive\" violence, but that kind of violence could surely come, by accident, or by the design of either side.</p> <p>One exception to the rule that Israeli prime ministers are usually weak is that they can authorise large scale military operations, particularly if they are ex-generals. Escalation cannot be ruled out, and at its worst, it could force Arab neighbours, however reluctantly, to take action against Israel. This may be remote, but it would be foolish to believe it could never happen.</p> <p>In the face of such dangers, the sad thing about the Israeli election campaign is that the proposition that Israel needs to offer significantly more to achieve peace simply cannot be discussed, because it is beyond the limits of the possible except for a minority of radicals. On the Palestinian side it may be that feelings have reached such a point that even if by some miracle Israel did bring itself to make an improved offer it might still be rejected.</p> <p>Whether there is any real exploration of these possibilities going on at Taba seems unlikely. Yasser Arafat ought to want to avoid a Sharon government and, if he does, he must know that some signal of progress from Taba might help Barak. Barak himself seems to be calculating that once he can get Peres out of the picture he will be able to pick up the extra votes he needs to have a chance of victory. If he won, Sharon might behave, as most seem to think, in a circumspect way, but his history suggests there is no guarantee of that. Barak as prime minister would be preferable to Sharon.

      "bodyText": "Days after burying one assassinated leader, the Democratic Republic of Congo is to rake over the bones of another. The son of the murdered independence leader Patrice Lumumba goes to court in Kinshasa today to sue Belgium, Congo's former colonial master, for killing his father. The hearing was originally due on January 17, the 40th anniversary of Lumumba's death, but it was delayed by the assassination of President Laurent Kabila, who always claimed that he had modelled himself on Congo's first elected prime minister. The parallel case is due to be heard in a Belgian court next week. Roland Lumumba, 43, the nationalist leader's youngest son, says he is bringing the action against Belgium, several Belgian individuals, and a CIA officer in an effort to establish the truth about his father's death. It has long been suspected that the Belgium ordered Lumumba's death, and its role has been highlighted recently by a film and several books. The Assassination of Lumumba, by the Flemish expert on Africa Lugo De Witte, claimed that he was assaulted in the presence of Belgian officers, tortured in a villa guarded by Belgian troops, and shot by an execution squad supervised by a Belgian captain. His body was later exhumed by a Belgian police commissioner, Gerard Soete, and dissolved in acid. Mr Soete admitted on Belgian television last year that he had kept two of the victim's teeth, prompting calls for their return to Congo. He insisted that he had later thrown them into the North Sea. \"We are doing this not for revenge but to know the truth,\" said Mr Lumumba, whose case is being funded by the Belgian organisation Affaire Patrice Emery Lumumba. \"They have hidden it for 40 years and that is now enough.\" Lumumba, a postal worker who became an inspirational anti-colonialist leader, was released from jail in 1960 to help negotiate independence terms. Six months later he became Congo's first elected prime minister at the age of 35, charged with holding together a country the size of western Europe. \"Before Lumumba there were only tribal and ethnic movements in Congo,\" said Roland, a tall man with his father's delicate features. \"He began the fight for freedom and unity.\" Belgium, hoping to extend its influence in Congo to exploit its natural resources, preferred the country weak and divided, and encouraged the province of Katanga, rich in copper and diamonds, to secede. As Soviet troops began to arrive in Kinshasa, Colonel Joseph-Desir\u00e9 Mobutu, Lumumba's protege and army chief, turned to the US instead, then seized power, beginning a corrupt 32-year dictatorship. Lumumba was murdered together with two political followers, whose families are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Embarrassed by the media interest, Belgium set up a parliamentary commission last year to examine the various claims that that it had ordered and carried out Lumumba's death. \"A group of experts, mainly historians, is examining documents to establish the responsibility of Belgium and maybe others,\" Michel Malherbe, deputy spokesman of the Belgian foreign ministry, said in Brussels yesterday. \"It will be a long-term process and there are definitely no plans for a report any time soon.\" He said he was he unaware of the legal actions in Congo and Belgium. Roland Lumumba hopes his case will force the commission's pace. \"Though we don't expect a lot from them, it is a start,\" he said. \"But we hope they will now produce the documents. It was natural that in the case of someone of Lumumba's calibre, \"who died doing his duty\", and \"with accusations flying here and there\", someone should demand a trial to find out exactly what happened. Mbu ne Letang Ntwa-Me-Zo, Mr Lumumba's lawyer, said: \"The death of the Lumumba was the origin of our problems over 40 years. \"We want this trial to force the Belgium government to give us all the evidence surrounding the assassination. The truth will be established and sanctions will follow.\" The families of Lumumba and the men murdered with him are suing for a nominal sum, but they say they reserve the right to amend this as more evidence comes to light. But the case is not about money, Mr Lumumba says. \"If this was about money we would have gone to Mobutu: he knew how to give money away,\" he said - a reference to the dictator's legendary corruption. \"Lumumba said the history of Congo will be written not in New York or Paris but here, and we are trying to learn that history. For me this is not personal. \"We have a duty to our children at least to try to find out the truth.\"",

Little of it concerns old fashioned Jonathan Aitken or Neil Hamilton back-handers. Most of it concerns raising private money for political parties or for semi-political projects like the dome. Enough words have sent Peter Mandelson on his lonely way: the man has paid a painful price. But the question remains - should democratic politicians ever be put into a position where they have to raise vast sums from rich men? As a mea culpa, Labour's manifesto should now include a pledge to end political fund-raising sleaze once and for all and commit to state funding and regulation of parties from now on.</p> <p>The party conferences reek of ill-gotten cash, more each year that passes. Delegates and press alike are forcibly decked out in advertising slogans of sponsors on security passes. Everything is sponsored, chairs you sit on, air you breathe, all sponsors fruitily praised and thanked for the canapes and drinks at meetings or the printing of the party agenda packs, as ministers scuttle between gold plate dinners among the fund-raising access, easements and embellishments. Looking round the colossal exhibition halls at Labour's conference last year, the smell of lucre from industrialists, lobbyists, benefactors and even cash-paying fatcat charities overpowered the fish and chips. What were they all doing there, paying a small fortune for their showy booths to catch the politicians' eyes? Either it was for the personal vanity of CEOs who want to be there while their shareholders or charity fund collectors pay the bill - or it is plain cash for influence. An aroma of favours, the minister's ear, influence, greasy palms, the shimmer of power swills together in foetid hotel meeting rooms. Innocent by US standards, nothing like the ostentatious company champagne flowing at Tory conferences in their glory days, still small beer - but this is how it begins.</p> <p>Its tentacles reach out to the think-tanks and party affiliates. Those that can persuade potential benefactors that they have the true ear of their party leaders can expect rich rewards in sponsorship money. Is it because companies, banks or management consultancies genuinely want to nurture creative new political thought? More likely they hope that linking their name to a close party organisation will somehow, some day ease their way into whatever it is they want - a contract or just a pleasing rubbing of shoulders with the mighty for their managing director.</p> <p>It is the big money from the millionaires that is most lethally damaging. Asil Nadir, Jeffrey Archer, Michael Ashcroft, the Hindujas, Bernie Ecclestone, Michael Wheeler, Stanley Kalms, Robert Bourne - whether eccentrics or sincere believers, whether paying to steer the party's ideology or paying for naked gain, the mud always sticks. And it sticks both ways. Scrupulously honest men like David Sainsbury or Paul Hamlyn get tarred with the same brush by the simple act of giving to a cause they support: in politics generosity is turned to acid spite. There is no free lunch, there is no donation without strings. Even those who want nothing are still using their deep pockets to promote the party of their choice. But the days of buying elections must be over now. A royal commission should be appointed to devise a generally acceptable fair funding formula: there is no perfect system, but anything is better than government by millionaire.</p> <p>Labour has been oddly tentative about this. Not because it has anything to fear - it is the Tories who might suffer more from fair state funding. The Blairites fear that politicians and parties are so thoroughly loathed that the public would rebel at taxpayers' money paying for Millbank and Central Office. This super-caution on all electoral reform is Labour cowardice: part of the reason for cynicism, low turnout and sinking public trust is because of the slush money. On the doorsteps too many people say: \"None of them! They're all the same, only in it for themselves!\" They do not distinguish clearly between dubious party fundraising and criminal lining of politicians' pockets. Voters would be easily persuaded that a piffling sum from the Treasury - around \u00a350m - is a price well worth paying for seagreen incorruptibility. A royal commission would have to devise a quid pro quo for state funding: the IPPR points out that present near-derelict parties would need a duty to engage voters with a recruit-or-die formula instead of running local democracy as private fiefdoms.</p> <p>On February 16, the Neill/Nolan reforms come into force obliging revelation of all gifts over \u00a35,000 and banning foreign donors. But each revelation only adds to public contempt. This election each party will be capped at \u00a320m, money splashed all over the country in gigantic hoardings selling incredible promises and preposterous insults against the enemy that bring politics into disrepute. People will rightly see this as money badly raised and badly spent, futile frittering of fortunes to virtually zero electoral effect, offending the voters' IQ. Trade unions (30%) and individual big donors (20%) now pay for half Labour funding: an unknown but higher proportion of Tory costs are paid by companies and big donors. Tony Blair said he was \"absolutely proud\" of the mega-donations from successful entrepreneurs. He cannot be serious - but how can he admit it is shaming and humiliating to a democratic leader?</p> <p>This is a pretty clean government. Venality accusations just don't stick to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown or the rest - so how have they allowed Eccelstone and Hinduja allegations to sink them in the mud? Because big money will always corrode politics. Helmut Kohl's giant reputation for uniting Germany when lesser leaders might have hesitated now lies in perpetual ruin because of illegal channelling of \u00a3600,000 in undisclosed donations to his party. French president Jacques Chirac and his party likewise are mired in allegations of selling building contracts for party-funding deals. As for George Bush, nearly \u00a3.5bn was raised and spent in hard and soft money - hugely more than Al Gore: the indulgences it bought are already rolling out. How is the west to high-horse it over third world dictatorships diverting national treasuries into Swiss bank accounts if our own democratic elections are financed by cash for favours?</p> <p>This is Labour high ground and Labour should go for it, do it now and defy the Tories to defend the buying of votes by plutocrats.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Because big money will always corrode politics. Helmut Kohl's giant reputation for uniting Germany when lesser leaders might have hesitated now lies in perpetual ruin because of illegal channelling of \u00a3600,000 in undisclosed donations to his party. French president Jacques Chirac and his party likewise are mired in allegations of selling building contracts for party-funding deals. As for George Bush, nearly \u00a3.5bn was raised and spent in hard and soft money - hugely more than Al Gore: the indulgences it bought are already rolling out. How is the west to high-horse it over third world dictatorships diverting national treasuries into Swiss bank accounts if our own democratic elections are financed by cash for favours? This is Labour high ground and Labour should go for it, do it now and defy the Tories to defend the buying of votes by plutocrats. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Ken Saro-Wiwa, the writer and Ogoni activist hanged by the Nigerian military government five years ago, is once again on trial - this time before the country's truth commission. The families of four Ogoni chiefs murdered by Saro-Wiwa's supporters have told a special hearing by the commission, which is investigating human rights abuses under military rule, that he was responsible for the killings and deserved to hang. Saro-Wiwa's supporters say he was the victim of a conspiracy between the army and Shell to break the Ogoni protests. Saro-Wiwa,leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop), was hanged with eight supporters in November 1995 after a widely discredited military tribunal convicted him of ordering the murder of the four chiefs because they questioned his confrontational tactics in the Ogoni campaign for political autonomy and against Shell's dire environmental standards. The executions, which coincided with a Commonwealth summit in New Zealand, drew strong world condemnation. Although abroad he was widely regarded as a peaceful environmental activist, Saro-Wiwa kept a tight political grip on Ogoniland. His opponents there accused him of using brutal tactics against dissenters. The families of the four chiefs told the truth hearings that Saro-Wiwa used Mosop's youth wing as a personal militia against opponents, and that he condemned the chiefs to death by denouncing them as collaborators with General Sani Abacha's government. \"Saro-Wiwa's faction of Mosop unleashed terror on the community. They set up vigilante courts where they tried innocent Ogonis for unimaginable crimes and executed them by burying,\" the families said in their submission. \"We are here to seek justice and compensation for the loss of our fathers,\" Joseph Kobani, brother of one of the murdered chiefs, was reported to have told the panel in Port Harcourt. But Ledum Mitee, the present Mosop leader and the only one of the Ogonis on trial with Saro-Wiwa acquitted, said the hanged men were victims of a long conspiracy between Nigeria's various military rulers and Shell. He accused the oil company of arming the police and military so that they could crush opponents of its drilling in the Niger delta. He alleged that armed men had on several occasions used Shell-owned boats and helicopters in attacks on Ogoni villages. Shell is expected to make a submission later in the hearing. Military officers have also been called to testify about their role in Ogoniland.

You should worship me.\" Asked why he had once told a news conference that he knew of more than 200 ways to kill people and that the Ogonis had discovered only three or four, he said the statement was \"psychological warfare\". Mr Mitee said: \"If soldiers with the attitude of Colonel Okuntimo are allowed to walk free, then this panel will come to nothing.\" Before the hearing, the commission's chairman, Justice Chukwudifu Oputa, visited Ogoniland and offered an emotional apology. \"We all know that the Ogoni people, along with tens of other communities in the Niger delta, have suffered excessively [and] many precious lives were lost,\" he said. \"I call on you to forgive and forget the past ...

Well it was one of those TV moments that make years of sofa-dwelling worthwhile. </p> <p>It was in the genre of \"celeb gets dropped in the middle of nowhere and is left to fend for himself with only a video camera for company\". Our Ross was dropped on the edge of a very scenic lake, as I recall, and told to build his own shelter (which he did, but it flooded while he went to look for wood, so he had to build another one). The camera crew duly slunk off at sundown, leaving Kemp with only a gun and a cuddly bear provided by his (quite famous) girlfriend for company. </p> <p>Needless to say, especially if you watched the Without Motive dramas on ITV last year, he survived. Even if he did wake up to find the paw-print of something very large and grizzly right outside his tent. Scary! </p> <p>And now Jamie Oliver lookalike Ewan McGregor is having a go.

      "bodyText": "Does anyone remember when Ross Kemp got his bald head bitten by mosquitos in Alaska? No? Well it was one of those TV moments that make years of sofa-dwelling worthwhile. It was in the genre of \"celeb gets dropped in the middle of nowhere and is left to fend for himself with only a video camera for company\". Our Ross was dropped on the edge of a very scenic lake, as I recall, and told to build his own shelter (which he did, but it flooded while he went to look for wood, so he had to build another one). The camera crew duly slunk off at sundown, leaving Kemp with only a gun and a cuddly bear provided by his (quite famous) girlfriend for company. Needless to say, especially if you watched the Without Motive dramas on ITV last year, he survived. Even if he did wake up to find the paw-print of something very large and grizzly right outside his tent. Scary! And now Jamie Oliver lookalike Ewan McGregor is having a go. He's currently slogging it out in a South American jungle, learning how to survive for a BBC1 programme, Trips That Money Can't Buy. The hour-long special should be on our screens later this year, assuming he does survive (one wonders what the companies insuring these actors think of all this Tarzan business). But a final question remains. Is McGregor the right frontman for a programme called Trips That Money Can't Buy? Surely McGregor could afford just about any trip he wants, anywhere in the world, even one that involved swinging from vines in deepest Peru.

Minutes before a vote on the issue in the Scottish parliament yesterday, the executive announced a dramatic policy u-turn and said it would implement plans to fund long-term care for all pensioners. Scottish pensioners will now get free personal care, including bathing, changing dressings and assistance with eating - services that pensioners in England and Wales will continue to pay for. The government thought it had repaired its reputation with pensioners by promising to increase pensions faster than inflation this year, but the policy split between London and Edinburgh may make it harder for Labour to garner the grey vote at the forthcoming election. The decision to implement the care package, at a cost of \u00a3110m a year, reverses the announcement by Mr McLeish just a day earlier when he had offered a scheme that stopped short of the universal free care recommended by the Sutherland royal commission. Facing certain defeat after a stormy debate on the issue yesterday, the parliament minister, Tom McCabe, revealed the free care in an emergency statement. The u-turn had been brought about by the prospect of a cross-party rebellion which threatened to see Labour's LibDem coalition partners desert them to join an axis of SNP and Conservative MSPs and reject the compromise care package. The decision opens the biggest policy rift yet between Holyrood and Westminster. Mr McLeish, who had hinted when he took office that he wanted to implement the Sutherland recommendations in full, was said to have been pressed by Downing Street not to offer a vastly superior care package in Scotland because of the problems it would create, not least raising the spectre of care being decided by postcode.

      "byline": "David Hencke  and  Patrick Wintour",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Only four weeks ago John Reid, the new Northern Ireland secretary, was at the centre of a row for threatening and intimidating witnesses who gave evidence to an inquiry by Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner, into the forbidden use of taxpayers' cash for the benefit of the Labour party. She claimed that Mr Reid's conduct amounted to \"an attempt to frustrate my investigation\".</p> <p>The report contained an extraordinary tape-recording showing an increasingly irascible Mr Reid pressing witness Alex Rowley, the former general secretary of the Scottish Labour party, just before he was due to be interviewed by Ms Filkin on the scandal.</p> <p>The inquiry began after a complaint by journalist Dean Nelson, then with the Observer. He reported that Mr Reid, then Scottish secretary, and John Maxton, Labour MP for Glasgow Cathcart, had employed three researchers, paying their salaries from the MPs' official allowances. He claimed that the three, contravening the rules governing publicly funded MPs' researchers, were involved in Labour party campaigning. One was Mr Reid's son, Kevin.</p> <p>The parliamentary commissioner upheld the complaint, but MPs on the standards and privileges committee overturned her findings. The money was about \u00a316,000 to pay the salaries of the researchers; and not all their working time was spent on Labour party campaigning. There is no suggestion that Mr Reid misused the money for any other purpose.</p> <p>The main body of Ms Filkin's report, however, concentrates on the way Mr Reid and Mr Maxton - who later apologised - had interfered with four witnesses to the inquiry. They were Alex Rowley; John Rafferty, former Scottish Labour party campaign co-ordinator; Paul McKinney, former Labour party director of communications in Scotland; and Willie Sullivan, former Scottish development officer for the Scottish Labour party.</p> <p>Ms Filkin said \"the conduct of Dr Reid caused serious and increasing concern\" as her inquiries proceeded. \"I was left with the impression that many witnesses felt under considerable pressure as to what they should, or should not, say to me and how far, if at all, they should co-operate with my inquiry.\"</p> <p>In a strongly worded conclusion she found that loyal members of the Labour party had been put under enormous pressure not to provide her with evidence that could damage Mr Reid's explanation.</p> <p><b>Misleading</b><br></p> <p>On Mr Rowley in particular, she said: \"It is clear that Mr Rowley felt, and continues to feel, under pressure from Mr Reid to say things to me which he does not wish to say and which he regards as not wholly accurate or even misleading. And so far as other witnesses are concerned, he has told me: 'I have to say to you that I find it quite astonishing that many young people such as Annmarie Whyte [Scottish Labour party office manager] are being put in the position by one of the most senior politicians in Scotland that they are having to give dishonest information to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. I have been told that others whom you have contacted have felt under immense pressure'.\"</p> <p>Ms Filkin commented in her report: \"I view this conduct by Mr Reid as an attempt to frustrate my investigation.\"</p> <p>She went on: \"I have, for example, received evidence from Mr Rowley that, during two conversations shortly after my investigation began, Dr Reid made threats of a particularly disturbing kind to Mr Rowley, the thrust of which was that if he 'gave evidence which admitted doing wrong' he 'could face criminal prosecution and risked not being adopted by the party as a parliamentary candidate'.</p> <p>She reports: \"Mr Rowley was so concerned by Dr Reid's attitude that he decided, albeit reluctantly, to record their next conversation on tape. During these exchanges, which took place during a telephone call .. it is clear, both from his choice of words and the tone he adopts, that Dr Reid is seeking to agree a line with Mr Rowley which falls short of a full and comprehensive account of the events of which they both have knowledge. Thus, at one point Dr Reid says to Mr Rowley: 'You don't have to tell any lies. Do you know what I mean?' And later he adds: 'They cannot prove anything, Alex'. Towards the end of the conversation Dr Reid strongly discourages Mr Rowley from giving evidence to my enquiry on oath.\"</p> <p>She reported: \"I would add that Mr Rowley's protectiveness towards former colleagues and his continuing loyalty to the party made him initially unwilling to allow me to treat either his statement alleging threats to him by Dr Reid or the transcript of his telephone conversation with Dr Reid as evidence which I could quote in my report. But after it became clear to him that pressure was being applied both to him and other witnesses and that Dr Reid had impugned his integrity as a witness, he decided reluctantly to change his mind.\"</p> <p>This intimidation of the witnesses was carried out by both Mr Maxton and Mr Reid.

      "bodyText": "Only four weeks ago John Reid, the new Northern Ireland secretary, was at the centre of a row for threatening and intimidating witnesses who gave evidence to an inquiry by Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner, into the forbidden use of taxpayers' cash for the benefit of the Labour party. She claimed that Mr Reid's conduct amounted to \"an attempt to frustrate my investigation\". The report contained an extraordinary tape-recording showing an increasingly irascible Mr Reid pressing witness Alex Rowley, the former general secretary of the Scottish Labour party, just before he was due to be interviewed by Ms Filkin on the scandal. The inquiry began after a complaint by journalist Dean Nelson, then with the Observer. He reported that Mr Reid, then Scottish secretary, and John Maxton, Labour MP for Glasgow Cathcart, had employed three researchers, paying their salaries from the MPs' official allowances. He claimed that the three, contravening the rules governing publicly funded MPs' researchers, were involved in Labour party campaigning. One was Mr Reid's son, Kevin. The parliamentary commissioner upheld the complaint, but MPs on the standards and privileges committee overturned her findings. The money was about \u00a316,000 to pay the salaries of the researchers; and not all their working time was spent on Labour party campaigning. There is no suggestion that Mr Reid misused the money for any other purpose. The main body of Ms Filkin's report, however, concentrates on the way Mr Reid and Mr Maxton - who later apologised - had interfered with four witnesses to the inquiry. They were Alex Rowley; John Rafferty, former Scottish Labour party campaign co-ordinator; Paul McKinney, former Labour party director of communications in Scotland; and Willie Sullivan, former Scottish development officer for the Scottish Labour party. Ms Filkin said \"the conduct of Dr Reid caused serious and increasing concern\" as her inquiries proceeded. \"I was left with the impression that many witnesses felt under considerable pressure as to what they should, or should not, say to me and how far, if at all, they should co-operate with my inquiry.\" In a strongly worded conclusion she found that loyal members of the Labour party had been put under enormous pressure not to provide her with evidence that could damage Mr Reid's explanation. Misleading On Mr Rowley in particular, she said: \"It is clear that Mr Rowley felt, and continues to feel, under pressure from Mr Reid to say things to me which he does not wish to say and which he regards as not wholly accurate or even misleading. And so far as other witnesses are concerned, he has told me: 'I have to say to you that I find it quite astonishing that many young people such as Annmarie Whyte [Scottish Labour party office manager] are being put in the position by one of the most senior politicians in Scotland that they are having to give dishonest information to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. I have been told that others whom you have contacted have felt under immense pressure'.\" Ms Filkin commented in her report: \"I view this conduct by Mr Reid as an attempt to frustrate my investigation.\" She went on: \"I have, for example, received evidence from Mr Rowley that, during two conversations shortly after my investigation began, Dr Reid made threats of a particularly disturbing kind to Mr Rowley, the thrust of which was that if he 'gave evidence which admitted doing wrong' he 'could face criminal prosecution and risked not being adopted by the party as a parliamentary candidate'. She reports: \"Mr Rowley was so concerned by Dr Reid's attitude that he decided, albeit reluctantly, to record their next conversation on tape. During these exchanges, which took place during a telephone call .. it is clear, both from his choice of words and the tone he adopts, that Dr Reid is seeking to agree a line with Mr Rowley which falls short of a full and comprehensive account of the events of which they both have knowledge. Thus, at one point Dr Reid says to Mr Rowley: 'You don't have to tell any lies. Do you know what I mean?' And later he adds: 'They cannot prove anything, Alex'. Towards the end of the conversation Dr Reid strongly discourages Mr Rowley from giving evidence to my enquiry on oath.\" She reported: \"I would add that Mr Rowley's protectiveness towards former colleagues and his continuing loyalty to the party made him initially unwilling to allow me to treat either his statement alleging threats to him by Dr Reid or the transcript of his telephone conversation with Dr Reid as evidence which I could quote in my report. But after it became clear to him that pressure was being applied both to him and other witnesses and that Dr Reid had impugned his integrity as a witness, he decided reluctantly to change his mind.\" This intimidation of the witnesses was carried out by both Mr Maxton and Mr Reid. Mr Maxton told Ms Filkin that three of the witnesses had been dismissed by the Labour party and alleged that \"they apparently bear a grudge against Dr Reid as a result\" and he had become \" the unlucky and unwilling victim of that grudge\". Mr Reid accused Mr Rowley of only pursuing the case because he had talked to the Observer and that \"he may feel he cannot back out from this serious attack on [my] probity\". Ms Filkin concluded: \"I have no reason to believe Dr Reid's explanation of Mr Rowley's possible motives in giving evidence in support of the complaint. In any case, Dr Reid's theory begs the question as to why, if they are not true, Mr Rowley should have made the allegations to Mr Nelson in the first place.\" She found no evidence of dismissal for incompetence. The MPs failed to uphold her complaint on the grounds that it was \"not proven.\" They said the tape contained no threats, and what Mr Reid said could have had an innocent explanation. Mr Reid is known to be furious about Ms Filkin's report since he does not regard himself as putting any pressure on witnesses to tell lies to the commissioner.",

At least two more houses on the hilltop estate in Bradford will shortly be boarded up like the six on the Close, where families from Poland, Latvia and the Czech republic said they could not stand the persecution any longer. \"We have started the eviction process against a barbaric and idiotic minority and we will see it through,\" Kris Hopkins, a Bradford city councillor, said yesterday. \"Anyone who comes to Bradford is going to be treated like everyone else.\" The evictions are the first in the country specifically triggered by harassment of asylum seekers - including stone throwing and attacks on children which has nauseated neighbours in the cul de sac. \"They were decent people,\" said Jack Howgate, a retired bus driver whose semi now looks out on eyeless houses with every window sealed by metal grilles. \"I lent them my lawnmower when they moved in last summer and they got into the habit of coming over and mowing my lawn after they'd done theirs.\" Further up the close, Billy Smith, 23, started weight-lifting sessions with Derek, the burliest of the Czechs, who have moved with the other Ferriby families to undisclosed addresses in Bradford. \"They were OK,\" Mr Smith said. \"There was a problem with English but there was a nine-year-old kid called Vanessa who did loads of translating. The trouble is, there are a lot of idiots on this estate - the same ones who stone the buses and spray the drivers with that smelly stuff you get from joke shops.\" There was wider resentment, however, said Derek Learoyd, a night shift truck driver who lives in Ferriby Close. \"There was jealousy when their houses were redecorated ready for them,\" he said. \"Nothing against the families themselves, but everyone round here's been waiting for ever for repairs.\" Initial abuse in the street was followed by stones through windows and trailing of families when they went shopping or to school. Over Christmas, most of the asylum seekers went to see relatives in London and Kent and returned to find their houses burgled and vandalised. The estate's residents' association, Fagley Action Group, tried to use the local grapevine to explain that government refugee money, not Bradford cash, had paid for the repairs. \"We're not standing for a situation where the majority of decent people on estates dare not protest, because they think they'll be out on a limb and the council will just pussyfoot around,\" said Mr Hopkins. \"We're using our standard tenant enforcement policy, agreed with all tenants. This case happens to involve asylum seekers but we'll do the same for anyone who gets picked on.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, choked back his anger last night and ordered his negotiators to continue the peace talks with the Palestinians which had resumed for barely an hour when an Israeli motorist was fatally shot in a car on the road between Jerusalem and Ramallah. Nevertheless, the latest killing could yet deliver the death blow to the stop-start talks. It happened 48 hours after two Tel Aviv cafe owners were shot dead in the West Bank town of Tulkaram. Their death prompted Mr Barak to suspend the talks until the funerals yesterday. The negotiators had been talking for barely an hour when the latest killing came to light. But after conferring for an hour in a separate room, the Israeli team said the talks would go on. \"They talked with the prime minister and decided to stay,\" a senior Israeli source said. Security sources said last night's victim was shot in the head as he drove near the Atarot industrial estate, just north of Jerusalem. With only 12 days to go until Israel votes for a new prime minister, Mr Barak is desperate to persuade the voters that he remains a credible peacemaker. For his part the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has been galvanised by the increasingly real prospect that the hardline Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, could be Israel's next prime minister. Although the burly general's 20-point lead has slipped in the past few days, most analysts say it would take a miracle for Mr Barak to be re-elected. But that is what he and Mr Arafat want from Taba, in Egypt, where the talks are being held. Earlier this week Mr Barak sent the most senior figures in the Israeli peace camp to the resort on the Red Sea to try to restore his reputation for peacemaking, which has been demolished by the 17 weeks of bloody chaos in the West Bank and Gaza. Mr Barak and his campaign aides candidly admit that they do not expect the talks at Taba to produce a final settlement to the Middle East dispute. At most, Mr Barak and Mr Arafat would like to hammer out a road map for future diplomacy which could prevent Mr Sharon, if he is elected on February 6, imposing his own hardline agenda. In his first reaction last night, at a campaign rally for Russian immigrants in the coastal city of Ashdod, Mr Barak condemned the killing as \"a despicable murder\". He swore that Israel would hunt down the killers, but he did not immediately call his negotiators home. That could change, however. Mr Sharon and other rightwing figures criticised Mr Barak yesterday for his indecent haste in resuming the negotiations after the earlier killing.",

      "body": "<p>The extraordinary new double act at the helm of Letsbuyit.com last night insisted that the crisis-hit e-tailer has a bright future - despite issuing Christmas sales figures which again missed analysts' expectations. The chief executive, John Palmer, and his flamboyant white knight, a 27-year-old convicted German computer hacker named Kim Schmitz, insisted that a scaled back Letsbuyit.com would raise the 40m euros (\u00a325m) needed to take it through to 2002, when it says it will be in profit. </p> <p>\"I'm completely convinced that Letsbuyit can reach profitability despite its current problems,\" Mr Schmitz said. </p> <p>Their bullish assessment, combined with confirmation that Mr Schmitz's investment vehicle Kimvestor had agreed to provide 4m euros to stave off the threat of immediate bankruptcy, prompted frenzied trading of Letsbuyit shares on Germany's Neuer Markt. </p> <p>Private investors and day traders piled into the stock, driving its price up by 220% to 77 cents as a record 87m shares changed hands, in the hope that the e-commerce site will imminently resume trading. </p> <p>The duo said that unnamed new and existing investors are interested in putting up the 40m euros needed to push Letsbuyit forward, even though the business's major shareholder, Pro Sieben, said it did not intend to back the company further. </p> <p>\"We're in the final stages of negotiations and hope to make an announcement very soon,\" Mr Schmitz said. </p> <p>British broadcaster BSkyB, which paid \u00a310m for a 10% stake, is unlikely to consider injecting any more money until the Letsbuyit accounts - which have been heavily criticised by administrators - are put into some semblance of order. </p> <p>Lehman Brothers analyst Heidi Fitzpatrick warned that a lot of work had to be done before Letsbuyit became a viable business again. Its fourth-quarter revenues, announced yesterday, were 18% below her forecasts at 18m euros and full-year revenues for 2000 of 38.5m euros were below the company's own published targets of 45m euros. </p> <p>Mr Schmitz said that marketing spend would be reigned in, jobs cut and several offices around Europe closed to trim costs. \"The Paris, Munich and London operations will be the core,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Schmitz's dramatic emergence as a potential saviour has caused amazement in financial circles. \"I've seen some circuses in my time, but this one beats the lot,\" said one analyst. </p> <p><strong>Rags to riches tale</strong><br> </p> <p>The former hacker has achieved widespread fame in his homeland after being convicted of bypassing the security of Nasa, the Pentagon and Citibank under the name of Kimble, after the character of Richard Kimble in the film The Fugitive. </p> <p>After giving himself up to the authorities in the 1990s, Mr Schmitz developed an encryption service that claims to allow secure payments to be made over the internet and sold an 80% stake in this business to German credit firm TUV. </p> <p>The 6'4\", 18-stone giant has since divided his time between growing Kimvestor - which he values at 200m euros - and spending his money on top models, fast cars and expensive boats. He now owns a Challenger jet, a helicopter, several sports cars and a yacht. Last May he spent $1m (\u00a3684,000) chartering a 240-foot luxury yacht for a week, mooring it in Monte Carlo harbour for the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix and throwing lavish parties for guests including Prince Ranier of Monaco. </p> <p>Later that year, the same group of friends flew in his private jet to the party island of Ibiza and then to a castle in Ireland for a pheasant shooting trip. Mr Schmitz has posted pictures of his escapades on his website <a href=\"http://www.kimble.org\">www.kimble.org,</a> which he claims has had 20m hits. </p> <p>\"We are having a lot of fun,\" he said. However, he remains deadly serious about Kimvestor, which is midway through a pre-flotation private placement round with a target of 20m euros. </p> <p>\"Anyone who buys shares in this placement gets a guarantee that their value will eventually triple or they get their money back,\" he said. \"I will personally stand responsible for the state of this company, and you don't see many chief executives doing that. </p> <p>\"Kimvestor will achieve a market capitalisation of 1bn euros within five years.\"</p>",

British broadcaster BSkyB, which paid \u00a310m for a 10% stake, is unlikely to consider injecting any more money until the Letsbuyit accounts - which have been heavily criticised by administrators - are put into some semblance of order. Lehman Brothers analyst Heidi Fitzpatrick warned that a lot of work had to be done before Letsbuyit became a viable business again. Its fourth-quarter revenues, announced yesterday, were 18% below her forecasts at 18m euros and full-year revenues for 2000 of 38.5m euros were below the company's own published targets of 45m euros. Mr Schmitz said that marketing spend would be reigned in, jobs cut and several offices around Europe closed to trim costs. \"The Paris, Munich and London operations will be the core,\" he said. Mr Schmitz's dramatic emergence as a potential saviour has caused amazement in financial circles. \"I've seen some circuses in my time, but this one beats the lot,\" said one analyst. Rags to riches tale The former hacker has achieved widespread fame in his homeland after being convicted of bypassing the security of Nasa, the Pentagon and Citibank under the name of Kimble, after the character of Richard Kimble in the film The Fugitive. After giving himself up to the authorities in the 1990s, Mr Schmitz developed an encryption service that claims to allow secure payments to be made over the internet and sold an 80% stake in this business to German credit firm TUV. The 6'4\", 18-stone giant has since divided his time between growing Kimvestor - which he values at 200m euros - and spending his money on top models, fast cars and expensive boats. He now owns a Challenger jet, a helicopter, several sports cars and a yacht. Last May he spent $1m (\u00a3684,000) chartering a 240-foot luxury yacht for a week, mooring it in Monte Carlo harbour for the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix and throwing lavish parties for guests including Prince Ranier of Monaco. Later that year, the same group of friends flew in his private jet to the party island of Ibiza and then to a castle in Ireland for a pheasant shooting trip. Mr Schmitz has posted pictures of his escapades on his website www.kimble.org, which he claims has had 20m hits. \"We are having a lot of fun,\" he said. However, he remains deadly serious about Kimvestor, which is midway through a pre-flotation private placement round with a target of 20m euros. \"Anyone who buys shares in this placement gets a guarantee that their value will eventually triple or they get their money back,\" he said. \"I will personally stand responsible for the state of this company, and you don't see many chief executives doing that. \"Kimvestor will achieve a market capitalisation of 1bn euros within five years.\"",

Trials have begun on 30 British patients with inoperable lung cancer after indications that regular doses can help shrink tumours and prevent their return. Scientists hope that within five years they will know whether thalidomide is an effective treatment for a range of cancers. It was widely used between 1958 and 1962 as a wonder drug against morning sickness in pregnant women but caused horrific birth defects. Other studies over the past 10 years, mainly in the US, have suggested that the drug can combat some other cancers and threats to the immune system through HIV and lupus. It has an American licence to treat leprosy. Thalidomide appears first to stabilise blood flow around tumours where it tends to pulse and be chaotic. This can allow a better supply of traditional anti-cancer drugs administered through chemotherapy. But then it appears to block blood flow associated with the growth of new tumours. It was this that damaged foetuses more than a generation ago and left babies without limbs. About 450 British thalidomide victims survive, with a further 5,000 in other countries. The Cancer Research Campaign, which has funded some promising work suggesting low dose thalidomide treatment could help renal cancer, is funding the new project which has already recruited 13 volunteers with small cell lung cancer, which accounts for 9,000 deaths a year - a quarter of all those who die from lung cancer. Researchers are looking for more patients for the study based at UCL/Middlesex and Guy's hospitals in London and Cookridge hospital, Leeds.

I stopped being able to read and I have noticed over the last month that my abilities to read are returning and speeding up. I hope that's not coincidence.\" Vivien Kerr, coordinator for the Thalidomide Society, said: \"Some people have extremely strong views that it should never, never be used again because of the side effects and the impact it has had on their lives. \"It should really be used as a drug of last resort. If there is no other drug that has potential benefits in something like cancer, as long as guidelines are in place, are strict and properly monitored, particularly for women of child bearing age, we would not stand in the way.\" Useful links: www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=99 Cancer Research Campaign angiogenesis information www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/1998/20785lbl.htm US food &amp; drug administration thalidomide prescription information",

In a judgment dealing a blow to the Official Secrets Act, the court dismissed an attempt by the attorney general, Lord Williams, on behalf of MI6, to force newspapers to seek clearance before publication. MI6 also wanted the Sunday Times, which brought the case, to have to prove information had come to the \"widespread attention of the public at large\". Michael Tugendhat QC, for the newspaper, said it was ridiculous to expect editors to consult with intelligence officials, lawyers and judges as deadlines approached. After hours of argument, the media can now publish information about the activities of the security and intelligence services \"to such an extent that the information is in the public domain\". \"It is not right that they [editors] should be subjected to a fetter on freedom of expression which goes beyond this,\" said Lord Phillips. What precisely constituted \"the public domain\" was up to the judgment of editors. Extracts have been published in Komsomolskaya Pravda, A Russian tabloid, though the book is not yet widely available in Moscow. While British and Russian journalists in Moscow have copies, the court heard, the British embassy had not been able to find one. John Wadham, director of Liberty, the civil rights group, welcomed the result: \"It can't be right for Russian people to be able to read about the escapades of MI6 but for the people of this country - whose taxes pay for MI6 - to be unable to read the same information.\" But Lord Phillips sitting with Lord Justice Tuckey and Lord Justice Longmore, said it was desirable there was \"consultation\" between the newspaper and MI6 before it published matters which might damage the agency.",

Like other menaces to listed buildings, such as mould, they flourish in damp conditions.</p> <p>The state-of-the-art computer system now hidden in the servants' quarters of the 18th century mansion, near Wakefield, will monitor the humidity level in the dozens of rooms. If it rises to a level silverfish find comfortable, the house can switch on its own heating system to control it. The alarm will be raised not only on the spot but at National Trust headquarters in London.</p> <p>Curator Frances Jackson explained that Nostell Priory had a particular problem with silverfish, which were attracted by the handpainted Chinese wallpaper in the grandest room.

      "bodyText": "At Nostell Priory, one of the stateliest homes in Yorkshire, five miles of computer cable has been buried in the fabric of the building, at a cost of almost \u00a31m, to give the silverfish their marching orders. Silverfish are tiny insects which can devastate paper and textiles. Like other menaces to listed buildings, such as mould, they flourish in damp conditions. The state-of-the-art computer system now hidden in the servants' quarters of the 18th century mansion, near Wakefield, will monitor the humidity level in the dozens of rooms. If it rises to a level silverfish find comfortable, the house can switch on its own heating system to control it. The alarm will be raised not only on the spot but at National Trust headquarters in London. Curator Frances Jackson explained that Nostell Priory had a particular problem with silverfish, which were attracted by the handpainted Chinese wallpaper in the grandest room. In the 1740s Thomas Chippendale, who made most of the furniture for the house was anxiously warning his client Sir Rowland Will that the 18 rolls of paper would set him back 15 shillings (75p) a roll. Over two centuries later, the paper was priceless but had become a running buffet for the silverfish. The insects were attracted in swarms by the egg originally used to bind the paint to the paper. The house has been closed for 18 months for the work, but Ms Jackson estimated yesterday that the new system had extended the life of the contents by up to a century. Nostell Priory was given to the National Trust in the 1950s but it is still partly occupied by the St Oswald family, descendants of the builders. Derek Williams is the project joiner, with the job of dismantling dozens of mahogany door cases, and lifting hundreds of Georgian floorboards to thread the cabling. The trick question for those tendering for the job was how to get the cable across the billiard room. Anyone who suggested moving the long case clock was disqualified. The clock was made by John Harrison whose struggles to win the Admiralty prize for an accurate sea clock were chronicled in the bestseller Longitude.",

Oops, we've got that a bit wrong. It was not Britain but her neighbour, Ireland, to which the EU sent its missive. Yet a few years hence it could easily be Britain. And with a general election looming (as in Ireland) the political consequences would have been - well, interesting.</p> <p>Ireland has not just been the best performing economy in Europe in recent years, but the best in the world. The normally taciturn OECD was moved to refer to its five years of 9% growth recently as a \"stunning economic performance\". It even praised the country's incomes policy (still off limits in New Labour circles) as \"crucial\" in preventing social discord and excessive wage increases. True, the OECD was warning as far back as 1997 about the dangers of overheating the economy, but the Celtic Tiger just cruised on effortlessly confounding its critics.</p> <p>Even now, serious economists in Dublin are refusing to admit that there is a problem. They hint that the EU should be looking to learn from Ireland and not vice versa. Ireland is sitting on the EU's largest budget surplus (EU rules only require it to balance its budget) and though inflation was 6% in November, it fell to 4.6% last month amid expectations that it will fall further.</p> <p>The government argues that inflation is more to do with the weakness of the euro, high energy prices and high mortgage interest rates, now no longer controlled by the Irish. Ireland, for all its dramatic success, accounts for only 1% of the EU's economic wealth, so the ECB is not going to lower interest rates on its account alone.

      "bodyText": "The European Commission yesterday demanded that Gordon Brown abandon his plans for increased public spending and lower taxes on the grounds that they contravened EU policy. Oops, we've got that a bit wrong. It was not Britain but her neighbour, Ireland, to which the EU sent its missive. Yet a few years hence it could easily be Britain. And with a general election looming (as in Ireland) the political consequences would have been - well, interesting. Ireland has not just been the best performing economy in Europe in recent years, but the best in the world. The normally taciturn OECD was moved to refer to its five years of 9% growth recently as a \"stunning economic performance\". It even praised the country's incomes policy (still off limits in New Labour circles) as \"crucial\" in preventing social discord and excessive wage increases. True, the OECD was warning as far back as 1997 about the dangers of overheating the economy, but the Celtic Tiger just cruised on effortlessly confounding its critics. Even now, serious economists in Dublin are refusing to admit that there is a problem. They hint that the EU should be looking to learn from Ireland and not vice versa. Ireland is sitting on the EU's largest budget surplus (EU rules only require it to balance its budget) and though inflation was 6% in November, it fell to 4.6% last month amid expectations that it will fall further. The government argues that inflation is more to do with the weakness of the euro, high energy prices and high mortgage interest rates, now no longer controlled by the Irish. Ireland, for all its dramatic success, accounts for only 1% of the EU's economic wealth, so the ECB is not going to lower interest rates on its account alone. Denied it own monetary policy, the Irish government does not want to tighten fiscal policy (ie raise taxes and reduce spending); Irish tax rates are already higher than in Europe. And it does not want to alienate the unions, whose cooperation was one of the secrets of success, along with inward investment, prudent fiscal policy and EU subsidies. If the independent Bank of England had been controlling interest rates there, it would have raised them a long time ago. Gordon Brown will not be the only one watching to see if Ireland once again confounds its critics and proves that you do not have to be in sync with the rest of the single currency area to run a successful economy.",

He believed passionately that the way in which we read a book, the way in which the eye falls upon the printed page, can radically influence our understanding and enjoyment.</p> <p>Born in London, Ryder left school in the mid-1930s to work as a bookseller at John Baker's Phoenix Book Company. It was at this time that he acquired his own hand-press and, without any formal training, made his first typographical experiments.</p> <p>While a registered conscientious objector during the second world war, he served as a private in the army, working on Britain's east coast defences, loading supply ships in Cardiff and digging for unexploded bombs in Bedfordshire, before joining an airborne surgical unit that was parachuted into Normandy and over the Rhine at Wesel.</p> <p>After a brief period in Palestine, he was demobilised and returned to work for John Baker, who had transferred his bookshop into the pub lishing imprint of Phoenix House, a subsidiary of JM Dent.</p> <p>In 1955, John Ryder published his first book, Printing for Pleasure, a primer that gave enormous encouragement and satisfaction to generations of amateur printers and which went through numerous editions. In 1957 he joined The Bodley Head, and it was during his 30-year career there as art director that, with the support of the firm's new proprietor, Max Reinhardt, he established his reputation as a designer of books.</p> <p>His distinctive, restrained and elegant house style adorned such works as the 1960 edition of Joyce's Ulysses, the first editions of books by authors such as Graham Greene and William Trevor, and some of the outstanding illustrated children's books of the time, including those of his lifelong friend and admirer, Maurice Sendak.</p> <p>\"The typographer's art should be invisible,\" he once said, \"the hand which seeks perfection, but which is never actually seen.\" Ryder's combination of taste, skill and self-effacement was bred in him early in his working life by mentors such as Jan Tschichold, the great German designer who revolutionised design at Penguin Books after the second world war. Another powerful influence was his friend, the Italian scholar-printer and doyen of private presses, Giovanni Mardersteig, on whose beautiful books, produced at the Officina Bodoni in Verona, Ryder was an authority.</p> <p>Ryder's archive of printed books, correspondence and working papers was donated to the Bodleian Library in Oxford in 1974. It was the occasion for a retrospective exhibition, one which gave illuminating insight into the designer's art and revealed Ryder's close involvement with the private press movement and his exceptionally close working relationship with the lettering artist Michael Harvey.</p> <p>In 1979, alarmed by some of the startling techniques engendered by computer setting, Ryder published The Case for Legibility. \"The theatre of war was sometimes terrifying,\" he wrote, \"but the present terror of being overcome by illiteracy and blinded by illegibility is just as real... whatever is done must be done for the reader's benefit and for maximum legibility... You must present an author's work to the reader without fuss and with design techniques as invisible as possible.\"</p> <p>His credo as a book designer was summed up in the last of his nine books, the beautifully produced Intimate Leaves from a Designer's Notebook (1993), in which he expounded his concept of \"visual editing\" and reflected on the many functions of the designer of words.</p> <p>In her introduction, Jan Morris wrote: \"He can gauge exquisitely the effect of congeniality in letterforms or an excess of spacing, he is passionately interested in the relationship between the meaning of words and the look of them, and he demonstrates that the making of the book is really a joint work of creation, achieved in collaboration between its author, its illustrator, its de signer, its binder - and, in a sense, its reader.\"</p> <p>For 17 years Ryder and I worked together at The Bodley Head, where a stream of visitors (printers, jacket artists, librarians, book dealers and collectors) used to file daily through his door. He was a man of exceptional energy and impish humour, totally immersed in the process of publishing. He endeared himself to many of his colleagues.</p> <p>He was also a man of habit, efficient and tidy, with pronounced views on literature, painting and the theatre, but little time for politics or business, or the world outside the parameters he built around himself. He liked listening to Radio 3, but refused to own a television; he enjoyed the Garrick Club, where he was a member for more than 30 years, but was equally happy dining at Pizza Express.</p> <p>He was sustained in everything he did by his wife, the literary agent Herta Hagen. For almost 50 years, until her death in 1995, they shared a passion for collecting books and paintings and listening to music at their home on the edge of Richmond Park.</p> <p>\u0095 John Ryder, book designer, born October 6 1917; died January 18 2001</p>",

While a registered conscientious objector during the second world war, he served as a private in the army, working on Britain's east coast defences, loading supply ships in Cardiff and digging for unexploded bombs in Bedfordshire, before joining an airborne surgical unit that was parachuted into Normandy and over the Rhine at Wesel. After a brief period in Palestine, he was demobilised and returned to work for John Baker, who had transferred his bookshop into the pub lishing imprint of Phoenix House, a subsidiary of JM Dent. In 1955, John Ryder published his first book, Printing for Pleasure, a primer that gave enormous encouragement and satisfaction to generations of amateur printers and which went through numerous editions. In 1957 he joined The Bodley Head, and it was during his 30-year career there as art director that, with the support of the firm's new proprietor, Max Reinhardt, he established his reputation as a designer of books. His distinctive, restrained and elegant house style adorned such works as the 1960 edition of Joyce's Ulysses, the first editions of books by authors such as Graham Greene and William Trevor, and some of the outstanding illustrated children's books of the time, including those of his lifelong friend and admirer, Maurice Sendak. \"The typographer's art should be invisible,\" he once said, \"the hand which seeks perfection, but which is never actually seen.\" Ryder's combination of taste, skill and self-effacement was bred in him early in his working life by mentors such as Jan Tschichold, the great German designer who revolutionised design at Penguin Books after the second world war. Another powerful influence was his friend, the Italian scholar-printer and doyen of private presses, Giovanni Mardersteig, on whose beautiful books, produced at the Officina Bodoni in Verona, Ryder was an authority. Ryder's archive of printed books, correspondence and working papers was donated to the Bodleian Library in Oxford in 1974. It was the occasion for a retrospective exhibition, one which gave illuminating insight into the designer's art and revealed Ryder's close involvement with the private press movement and his exceptionally close working relationship with the lettering artist Michael Harvey. In 1979, alarmed by some of the startling techniques engendered by computer setting, Ryder published The Case for Legibility. \"The theatre of war was sometimes terrifying,\" he wrote, \"but the present terror of being overcome by illiteracy and blinded by illegibility is just as real... whatever is done must be done for the reader's benefit and for maximum legibility... You must present an author's work to the reader without fuss and with design techniques as invisible as possible.\" His credo as a book designer was summed up in the last of his nine books, the beautifully produced Intimate Leaves from a Designer's Notebook (1993), in which he expounded his concept of \"visual editing\" and reflected on the many functions of the designer of words. In her introduction, Jan Morris wrote: \"He can gauge exquisitely the effect of congeniality in letterforms or an excess of spacing, he is passionately interested in the relationship between the meaning of words and the look of them, and he demonstrates that the making of the book is really a joint work of creation, achieved in collaboration between its author, its illustrator, its de signer, its binder - and, in a sense, its reader.\" For 17 years Ryder and I worked together at The Bodley Head, where a stream of visitors (printers, jacket artists, librarians, book dealers and collectors) used to file daily through his door. He was a man of exceptional energy and impish humour, totally immersed in the process of publishing. He endeared himself to many of his colleagues. He was also a man of habit, efficient and tidy, with pronounced views on literature, painting and the theatre, but little time for politics or business, or the world outside the parameters he built around himself. He liked listening to Radio 3, but refused to own a television; he enjoyed the Garrick Club, where he was a member for more than 30 years, but was equally happy dining at Pizza Express. He was sustained in everything he did by his wife, the literary agent Herta Hagen. For almost 50 years, until her death in 1995, they shared a passion for collecting books and paintings and listening to music at their home on the edge of Richmond Park. \u0095 John Ryder, book designer, born October 6 1917; died January 18 2001",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds set to miss the boat A decision on whether Lloyds TSB's proposed bid for Abbey National will be referred for a competition review is likely to be delayed, according to industry sources. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) was due to make its recommendation on the proposed deal in time for trade secretary Stephen Byers to announce a decision by February 2. Abbey National is planning to merge with Bank of Scotland, a deal which is expected to be cleared by regulators by February 8 -ahead of the likely decision on the Lloyds TSB bid. Spreading the Guardian net Guardian Unlimited, the network of websites related to the Guardian newspaper, is being rebranded to make the relationship between the two more explicit. The core web address for the sites is changing to theguardian.com, which will be underscored by a \u00a36m marketing campaign. The group also announced the launch of three new sites: theguardian.com/travel, to be launched in February and others devoted to politics and sport. Guardian Newspapers has so far invested about \u00a320m in the websites over the past three years and expects to break even within three to four years. Valor may slash 400 jobs Up to 400 manufacturing jobs are under threat after Birmingham-based gas fire company Valor announced it is considering relocating to Preston. A review of the business has been underway since Valor's parent company, Newmond, merged with Preston-based rival Baxi three months ago. The company admitted that \"one option being considered\" is to move its manufacturing away from Birmingham, and informed the 400 Valor staff at meetings yesterday afternoon. The Birmingham plant, which the company has described as state of the art, makes one in five of the gas fires sold in the UK. FSA to add a third director The financial services authority is appointing a third managing director who will be charged with improving the public's understanding of financial services, it said yesterday. Boosting financial awareness among consumers will be a key priority during the year ahead, said the FSA in its annual plan and budget for 2001-02. NTL raises subscriber goal NTL, Britain's biggest cable TV company, yesterday set a target of 1.25m digital subscribers by the end of the year. At the end of last year, the figure stood at 530,700. The company is raising its subscription prices by \u00a32 for the basic package of TV channels.

Full of cool kung fu, bodies flying around the trajectory of bullets, it makes John Woo look like Anthony Asquith.

      "body": "<p>Was Max Schreck a real vampire? Did the star of Nosferatu, the 1922 horror classic, strike a bargain with its director FW Murnau - to appear in his movie in return for being allowed to drain the entire cast and crew of their blood afterwards? E Elias Merhige's semi-serious comedy Shadow of the Vampire, starring Willem Dafoe as Schreck, takes this much-mooted fantasy and runs with it to remarkably silly effect. </p> <p>Film buffs have long wondered about Schreck, with his unforgettable visage, ridiculous name (\"schreck\" means \"horror\" in German), and sketchy CV. Could this creepiest of silent goths have harboured a ghastly secret we could only guess at? Such gruesome speculation has only served to invest Nosferatu with an extra frisson singular among German expressionist landmarks. </p> <p>Of course, Schreck was as human as you or I, and no one on the set of Nosferatu actually died. But Shadow of the Vampire only strives for historical accuracy half of the time, and Merhige and screenwriter Steven Katz have a fine old time playing around with the facts. But re-imagining Schreck as his most famous incarnation is only Shadow of the Vampire's most conspicuous untruth. The film also manipulates and manhandles the legend of Murnau himself. John Malkovich plays Murnau as a Teutonic professor running amok in a lab coat and goggles. Ready to sacrifice life, limb and cast members to get \"the shot\", he's a stereotypical director-as-dictator, convinced that since art (and movies) last more or less forever and people don't, then one is expendable in the service of the other. </p> <p>The closest off-screen double to this Murnau is Werner Herzog, the world's most gonzo film-maker and centrepiece of some of the most spectacular and extreme making-of-a-movie stories ever heard. Herzog actually remade Nosferatu in 1977 and, although Klaus Kinski, the lead, was not a real vampire, he was a very real nut. This made him the perfect foil for Herzog, who, unable to get the right shade of rat he wanted for filming, simply painted thousands of white rats grey. Then, notoriously, he let them loose in Bremen. </p> <p>But the real Murnau was a very different animal. Born Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe, Murnau was by all accounts a perfectly decent, disciplined professional - a gay aesthete and self-doubting artist who saw plenty of action as a combat pilot in the first world war and subsequently segued into a career as a theatre director and propaganda editor. He broke into film-making in 1919 and quickly distinguished himself within the German expressionist movement, and had made nine films in three short years before arriving at Nosferatu in 1922. Most of these films are lost (including Der Januskopf, a Jekyll-Hyde rendition starring Bela Lugosi and Conrad Veidt), but the few that aren't, like 1921's The Haunted Castle, are forgettable nonsense. </p> <p>Nosferatu is a quantum leap, an experimental, moody, fluid nightmare that plays today like a crypt dream, damp, rank and perverse. Less a \"masterpiece\" than an artefact whose age and primitive mould contribute lavishly to its effect, Nosferatu was nevertheless a vast improvement in cinematic grace and visual originality over the influential German silents released up until that time, even Paul Wegener's The Golem and Fritz Lang's Spiders. </p> <p>The film's story - essentially Dracula with the names changed to appease Bram Stoker's angry widow - seems to have been incidental for Murnau. He was one of cinema's first poets and his haphazard, accident-strewn body of work leaves the impression of an artist more in love with the abstract possibilities of movies than with the stories he was filming. Monsters, tragedies, lovers - all paled for him beside the simple sensation of cinematic motion. </p> <p>Cinema has always been \"about\" visual movement, starting with 1902's The Great Train Robbery, with its seminal third sequence - shot from the top of a moving train. In that moment, movies departed from any other pre-existing art or cultural form and became quintessentially \"cinematic\" - suddenly, a ribbon of film could do things that no other medium could ever do. Griffith and others used the magnetic power of travelling shots to limited effect, but it was Murnau who revealed that moving the camera in conjunction with action and locale was an act of almost magical force, an unspoken, majestic poetry that still seems to be one of the form's most sublime achievements. </p> <p>Take The Last Laugh (1923), a systematic morality tale about a pompous doorman (Emil Jannings) reduced to a washroom attendant. Now an overused film-school lynchpin , it is remembered less than fondly today. But, looking at it again, the movie is a workshop of experimental ideas, from multiple exposures to warped lenses. The camera hardly stops moving in The Last Laugh. Murnau didn't film a narrative so much as let one happen while he documented the visual-emotional terrain around it, moving in single shots from room to room, from inside the hotel to the street, up and down stairs, and so on. In this way, Murnau became the first powerhouse of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, creating for us a fully 3D world that was completely convincing and progressed for us far beyond the frame edge. Murnau had created that mysterious and still under-appreciated cinematic device: off-screen space. </p> <p>His subsequent films - including a restless version of Tartuffe and a hellzapoppin' version of Goethe's Faust (both 1926) - are German expressionist classics. The latter's sorcerous night-time cityscapes and looming demonic visions are unforgettable (The Crow, for one, could not have existed without it). In both films, as critic David Thomson has pointed out, Murnau took the studied, decorative dead end of expressionism to another level, where it was free to roam and find poetry in the everyday. </p> <p>But it wasn't until Murnau hightailed it to Hollywood that his talent was given full rein (and, as historian Lotte Eisner noted, Murnau's homosexuality was no longer subject to intolerant German law). Contracted by 20th Century Fox, Murnau took a minor, trite story about marital crisis and resolution - subtitled A Song of Two Humans - and crafted what was to become his 1927 masterpiece, Sunrise. </p> <p>Anything but gothic, Sunrise is a rhapsodic, romantic work, and yet the simplistic story and its eventually conservative message were, typically for Murnau, secondary concerns. It was here that the director's camera really soared. The passage in which the discontented country husband (George O'Brien) leaves his wife (Janet Gaynor) and baby behind to meet his trampy, urbanised lover in the moonlit swamplands is, by itself, a testament to the glories of cinematic vision. </p> <p>But even that sequence was beaten by the celebrated trolley scene, in which the couple (the wife now trying to escape from her apologetic husband, who came close to murdering her) take a trolley ride (with Murnau's camera) that passes from the wooded countryside to the city's bustling edge. During the ride, the two characters avoid each other's eyes. As they furtively gaze into space, we watch from our own seats the landscape passing around them, and the movement itself tells us all we'd ever want to know about marriage and fate, about being locked into powerful coupledom that's equal parts devotion and danger as the world outside rockets by. </p> <p>Sunrise showcased every visual flourish Murnau could imagine, and it is a breath-taking achievement. Its failure at the box office, however, seriously restricted Murnau's subsequent studio projects, and he eventually left for Tahiti with documentarian Robert Flaherty to make Tabu (1931). Another conspicuously minor story - tribal laws obstruct the course of true love - Tabu is 90% Murnau, Flaherty having quit some time during shooting. It's difficult to imagine a less opportune pairing than Murnau the spatial poet and Flaherty the practical anthropologist, but Murnau's input ensures that Tabu isn't the travesty it could have been. It is, in fact, a beautiful, sun-soaked portrait of a 3D place lyricised by Murnau's expert eye. </p> <p>Murnau's blossoming American career was cut cruelly short. On the verge of signing with the much more auteur-friendly Paramount, Murnau and his chauffeur died in a car crash on the Pacific coastal highway. (Persistent rumours about the two being engaged in oral sex prior to the crash came courtesy of celebrated scandal-peddler Kenneth Anger.) Murnau was just 42. </p> <p>Murnau was a million miles from the hollering, self-serving autocrat Malkovich portrays him as in Shadow of the Vampire. He was a delicate artist, forever negotiating with industry and society, and tolerating pulp fiction in the service of getting the movie camera to fulfil its destiny. Certainly, he was the least \"vampiric\" of any major director this side of Renoir. </p> <p>Shadow of the Vampire is funny and sharp. But if you want a true portrait of the artist, see Sunrise. By any standards, it is essential viewing. </p> <p>&amp;3149; Shadow of the Vampire is released on Friday February 2. The Murnau season is at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), until January 30.</p>",

Less a \"masterpiece\" than an artefact whose age and primitive mould contribute lavishly to its effect, Nosferatu was nevertheless a vast improvement in cinematic grace and visual originality over the influential German silents released up until that time, even Paul Wegener's The Golem and Fritz Lang's Spiders. The film's story - essentially Dracula with the names changed to appease Bram Stoker's angry widow - seems to have been incidental for Murnau. He was one of cinema's first poets and his haphazard, accident-strewn body of work leaves the impression of an artist more in love with the abstract possibilities of movies than with the stories he was filming. Monsters, tragedies, lovers - all paled for him beside the simple sensation of cinematic motion. Cinema has always been \"about\" visual movement, starting with 1902's The Great Train Robbery, with its seminal third sequence - shot from the top of a moving train. In that moment, movies departed from any other pre-existing art or cultural form and became quintessentially \"cinematic\" - suddenly, a ribbon of film could do things that no other medium could ever do. Griffith and others used the magnetic power of travelling shots to limited effect, but it was Murnau who revealed that moving the camera in conjunction with action and locale was an act of almost magical force, an unspoken, majestic poetry that still seems to be one of the form's most sublime achievements. Take The Last Laugh (1923), a systematic morality tale about a pompous doorman (Emil Jannings) reduced to a washroom attendant. Now an overused film-school lynchpin , it is remembered less than fondly today. But, looking at it again, the movie is a workshop of experimental ideas, from multiple exposures to warped lenses. The camera hardly stops moving in The Last Laugh. Murnau didn't film a narrative so much as let one happen while he documented the visual-emotional terrain around it, moving in single shots from room to room, from inside the hotel to the street, up and down stairs, and so on. In this way, Murnau became the first powerhouse of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, creating for us a fully 3D world that was completely convincing and progressed for us far beyond the frame edge. Murnau had created that mysterious and still under-appreciated cinematic device: off-screen space. His subsequent films - including a restless version of Tartuffe and a hellzapoppin' version of Goethe's Faust (both 1926) - are German expressionist classics. The latter's sorcerous night-time cityscapes and looming demonic visions are unforgettable (The Crow, for one, could not have existed without it). In both films, as critic David Thomson has pointed out, Murnau took the studied, decorative dead end of expressionism to another level, where it was free to roam and find poetry in the everyday. But it wasn't until Murnau hightailed it to Hollywood that his talent was given full rein (and, as historian Lotte Eisner noted, Murnau's homosexuality was no longer subject to intolerant German law). Contracted by 20th Century Fox, Murnau took a minor, trite story about marital crisis and resolution - subtitled A Song of Two Humans - and crafted what was to become his 1927 masterpiece, Sunrise. Anything but gothic, Sunrise is a rhapsodic, romantic work, and yet the simplistic story and its eventually conservative message were, typically for Murnau, secondary concerns. It was here that the director's camera really soared. The passage in which the discontented country husband (George O'Brien) leaves his wife (Janet Gaynor) and baby behind to meet his trampy, urbanised lover in the moonlit swamplands is, by itself, a testament to the glories of cinematic vision. But even that sequence was beaten by the celebrated trolley scene, in which the couple (the wife now trying to escape from her apologetic husband, who came close to murdering her) take a trolley ride (with Murnau's camera) that passes from the wooded countryside to the city's bustling edge. During the ride, the two characters avoid each other's eyes. As they furtively gaze into space, we watch from our own seats the landscape passing around them, and the movement itself tells us all we'd ever want to know about marriage and fate, about being locked into powerful coupledom that's equal parts devotion and danger as the world outside rockets by. Sunrise showcased every visual flourish Murnau could imagine, and it is a breath-taking achievement. Its failure at the box office, however, seriously restricted Murnau's subsequent studio projects, and he eventually left for Tahiti with documentarian Robert Flaherty to make Tabu (1931). Another conspicuously minor story - tribal laws obstruct the course of true love - Tabu is 90% Murnau, Flaherty having quit some time during shooting. It's difficult to imagine a less opportune pairing than Murnau the spatial poet and Flaherty the practical anthropologist, but Murnau's input ensures that Tabu isn't the travesty it could have been. It is, in fact, a beautiful, sun-soaked portrait of a 3D place lyricised by Murnau's expert eye. Murnau's blossoming American career was cut cruelly short. On the verge of signing with the much more auteur-friendly Paramount, Murnau and his chauffeur died in a car crash on the Pacific coastal highway. (Persistent rumours about the two being engaged in oral sex prior to the crash came courtesy of celebrated scandal-peddler Kenneth Anger.) Murnau was just 42. Murnau was a million miles from the hollering, self-serving autocrat Malkovich portrays him as in Shadow of the Vampire. He was a delicate artist, forever negotiating with industry and society, and tolerating pulp fiction in the service of getting the movie camera to fulfil its destiny. Certainly, he was the least \"vampiric\" of any major director this side of Renoir. Shadow of the Vampire is funny and sharp. But if you want a true portrait of the artist, see Sunrise. By any standards, it is essential viewing. &amp;3149; Shadow of the Vampire is released on Friday February 2. The Murnau season is at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), until January 30.",

At the end of the 1940s he joined the touring company of the last of the great actor-managers, Donald Wolfit, at the Bedford theatre in Camden Town.

      "body": "<p>In a way, the whole story is in the ring. The iconic photograph of Leila Khaled, the picture which made her the symbol of Palestinian resistance and female power, is extraordinary in many ways: the gun held in fragile hands, the shiny hair wrapped in a keffiah , the delicate Audrey Hepburn face refusing to meet your eye. But it's the ring, resting delicately on her third finger. To fuse an object of feminine adornment, of frivolity, with a bullet: that is Khaled's story, the reason behind her image's enduring power. Beauty mixed with violence. </p> <p>And the ring? \"I made it from the pin of a hand grenade - from the first grenade I ever used in training,\" she says. \"I just wrapped it around a bullet.\" </p> <p>Leila Khaled - international hijacker for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the papers' favourite 70s \"girl terrorist\" and \"deadly beauty\" - is now 57, and sitting with me in the House of Commons for her first ever interview on British soil. Her cheekbones are still like knives; her eyes are gentle but flicker when moved. She has a Rothmans cigarette constantly dangling languorously between her fingers (she once said of a potentially boring time in Kuwait: \"I was politically conscious and a chain smoker - I needed no other diversions\"). </p> <p>She is, of course, wearing a keffiah , fringed with wool in the Palestinian colours of red, green, black and white, like a shawl. But she looks very different now from the way she did in that famous photo, and not just because of age. Since that picture was taken in 1969, after her first (successful) hijack of a TWA plane, Khaled underwent no fewer than six cosmetic operations on her face, so that no one would ever recognise her again. She refused to wander around with the face of an icon. </p> <p>\"The surgeon just made a few differences to my nose and my chin,\" she says. \"But it worked. No one recognised me.\" She elected to have surgery without a general anaesthetic; because, as she said in her autobiography: \"I have a cause higher and nobler than my own, a cause to which all private interests and concerns must be subordinated.\" </p> <p>Such revolutionary-speak is a reminder that Khaled is from a very different time: an age when hijacks were a political tool of the moment, when commitment, extreme risk and sacrifice were admired and often romanticised. Her sexuality was always emphasised; as recently as 1980, a Norwegian newspaper made jokes about her \"bombs\" (Norwegian slang for breasts) and she is supposed to have been the inspiration for Leela, Dr Who's foxy sidekick in 1975. </p> <p>She is the pin-up of armed struggle; like her hero, Che Guevara, Khaled had the glamour as well as the belief. She had a certain disdain for her fellow western revolutionaries, however: \"We found it very amusing that they honestly believed they were making a 'revolution' if they undressed in public, seized a university building, or shouted an obscenity at bureaucrats,\" she says. </p> <p>The surgery meant that Khaled was able to undertake her second hijack without detection; this time of an El Al jet from Amsterdam. \"At Amsterdam airport my comrade Patrick [Arguello, a Nicaraguan] and I were stopped by Israeli officers,\" she says. \"They searched our bags very thoroughly, but they didn't find anything in there. Because the grenades were in my pockets.\" She takes a deep breath. \"We had passports from Honduras. The officer said to me, 'do you speak Spanish?' At once I said, 'Si se\u00f1or' - I was lucky, because they were the only words I knew.\" </p> <p>In mid-flight, Khaled and Arguello tried to storm the cockpit. They banged on the door; Khaled took the pins out of her grenades with her teeth and ordered the captain to let them in. But there were armed guards on the plane and they began to shoot. \"Patrick was shot in the back four times, and another man came with a bottle of whisky and banged it over his head,\" says Khaled. \"It was terrible.\" Why didn't they shoot her? \"I had grenades,\" she says, with a shrug of her shoulders. \"Eventually I was hit on the back of my head, and I lost consciousness. When I woke up I was tied up and being kicked. </p> <p>\"Passengers were shouting; I heard a woman scream, 'Stop the bloodshed'. But we had very strict instructions: don't hurt the passengers. Only defend yourselves.\" </p> <p>But the grenades would have hurt the passengers, had she released them. \"I did not want to blow up the plane,\" she says, sternly. \"It was only to threaten.\" (While the PFLP was involved in other controversial armed actions in Israel, including some which led to the deaths of civilians, no one died during either of the hijacks in which Khaled was involved. </p> <p>The plane landed at Heathrow and Khaled was taken to Ealing police station where she was held for 28 days, until the then prime minister, Edward Heath, released her in exchange for western hostages held by the PFLP. Her stay in Britain was pleasant, she says. \"People were very nice. They would say to each other: is she the one? They could hardly believe it, this tiny creature sitting on the bench. I was 26 and I was very thin. I had two policewomen with me in my cell, and we were always discussing our cause and our suffering. After I left I sent them books about Palestine; they asked me to. We wrote to each other. One of them had a problem with her boyfriend, and we often discussed this.\" </p> <p>It's an intriguing thought: the Palestinian revolutionary and the Ealing policewoman finding common ground by discussing men. </p> <p>Although it is not, perhaps, so surprising. Women have always related to Khaled. As Eileen Macdonald, in her book Shoot the Women First, puts it: \"She shattered a million and one taboos overnight and she revolutionised the thinking of hundreds of other angry young women around the world.\" </p> <p>She flamboyantly overcame the patriarchal restrictions of Arab society where women are traditionally subservient to their husbands, by taking an equal fighting role with men, by getting divorced and remarried, having children in her late 30s, and rejecting vanity by having her face reconstructed for her cause. </p> <p>There were difficulties with being both a woman and a fighter, however. \"In the beginning, all women had to prove that we could be equal to men in armed struggle,\" says Khaled. \"So we wanted to be like men - even in our appearance.\" Robin Morgan, in her book, The Demon Lover: The Sexuality of Terrorism, writes about how Khaled lost out in two ways. </p> <p>The men in her organisation resented the attention she got, while women were frustrated that she never spoke about women, only about the revolution. (She once said, \"I represent Palestinians, not women.\") This has echoes of something Mairead Farrell, the IRA volunteer who was shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar in 1988, once said: \"I'm oppressed as a woman, but I'm also oppressed because I'm Irish ... We can't succesfully end our oppression as women until we first end the oppression of our country.\" </p> <p>But things seem to have changed for Khaled. \"I no longer think it's necessary to prove ourselves as women by imitating men,\" she says. \"I have learned that a woman can be a fighter, a freedom fighter, a political activist, and that she can fall in love, and be loved, she can be married, have children, be a mother. </p> <p>\"You see, at the beginning we were only interested in the revolution. We were not mature enough politically. The question of women is a part of our struggle but not the only part. Revolution must mean life also; every aspect of life.\" Is she a Palestinian first, or a woman first? \"I cannot differentiate,\" she says. \"A woman and a Palestinian at the same time.\" </p> <p>Khaled was born in Haifa, now on the Israeli coast, but became a refugee with her family at a camp in Tyre, Lebanon, as a toddler in 1948. (During her 1969 hijacking of the TWA flight she forced the pilot to fly over Haifa, so that she could look at the home town she was not permitted to visit.) She can barely recall a time when she was not politicised: she remembers at the age of four being told by her mother not to pick oranges because they were in Lebanon; the fruit was not theirs, they were not in Haifa now. She committed herself full-time to armed struggle at the age of 15. </p> <p>Since the time of the hijacks, Khaled has lived in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, and has brought up two sons who are now 18 and 15. She continued her activism, first as a fighter and then as a politician for the PFLP as a member of the Palestinian National Council. (Her sons offer to be her bodyguards and when they were small really did say: \"Tell us stories about the struggle, mum.\") </p> <p>But she is still as radical as ever. \"The struggle of the Palestinians has taken many faces. Armed struggle, intifada, and now both. Which means as long as there is occupation in our country, the conflict will continue.\" She demands the right to self-determination, a state with Jerusalem as its capital, the right to return for refugees and the withdrawal of Israel from all the land it has occupied since 1967. \"Otherwise the purpose for conflict will always be there.\" And now? \"Now people are fed up. They are saying: now and forever. Let's do it. This time.\" </p> <p>What she says can be difficult for peaceniks, or pacifists, to hear - the unashamed justification for violence. Many ordinary Palestinians share her views, many politicians do not. Similarly, views on Khaled herself are mixed, even among Palestinians: some think she is an inspiring heroine, others believe she reinforces the old 70s image of Palestinians as terrorists. </p> <p>Is she a terrorist? \"Whenever I hear this word I ask another question,\" she says. \"Who planted terrorism in our area? Some came and took our land, forced us to leave, forced us to live in camps. I think this is terrorism. Using means to resist this terrorism and stop its effects - this is called struggle.\" She recalls in her memoirs thinking of the risk to children she saw on the plane she was hijacking, and telling herself: \"We Palestinians are children too and we are a part of the human race.\" </p> <p>Would she still die for the Palestinian cause? She draws on her long cigarette, and turns to face me after some silence. \"Of course.\" She shakes her head, smiling, cigarette burning in her hand. \"Of course.\"</p>",

Since that picture was taken in 1969, after her first (successful) hijack of a TWA plane, Khaled underwent no fewer than six cosmetic operations on her face, so that no one would ever recognise her again. She refused to wander around with the face of an icon. \"The surgeon just made a few differences to my nose and my chin,\" she says. \"But it worked. No one recognised me.\" She elected to have surgery without a general anaesthetic; because, as she said in her autobiography: \"I have a cause higher and nobler than my own, a cause to which all private interests and concerns must be subordinated.\" Such revolutionary-speak is a reminder that Khaled is from a very different time: an age when hijacks were a political tool of the moment, when commitment, extreme risk and sacrifice were admired and often romanticised. Her sexuality was always emphasised; as recently as 1980, a Norwegian newspaper made jokes about her \"bombs\" (Norwegian slang for breasts) and she is supposed to have been the inspiration for Leela, Dr Who's foxy sidekick in 1975. She is the pin-up of armed struggle; like her hero, Che Guevara, Khaled had the glamour as well as the belief. She had a certain disdain for her fellow western revolutionaries, however: \"We found it very amusing that they honestly believed they were making a 'revolution' if they undressed in public, seized a university building, or shouted an obscenity at bureaucrats,\" she says. The surgery meant that Khaled was able to undertake her second hijack without detection; this time of an El Al jet from Amsterdam. \"At Amsterdam airport my comrade Patrick [Arguello, a Nicaraguan] and I were stopped by Israeli officers,\" she says. \"They searched our bags very thoroughly, but they didn't find anything in there. Because the grenades were in my pockets.\" She takes a deep breath. \"We had passports from Honduras. The officer said to me, 'do you speak Spanish?' At once I said, 'Si se\u00f1or' - I was lucky, because they were the only words I knew.\" In mid-flight, Khaled and Arguello tried to storm the cockpit. They banged on the door; Khaled took the pins out of her grenades with her teeth and ordered the captain to let them in. But there were armed guards on the plane and they began to shoot. \"Patrick was shot in the back four times, and another man came with a bottle of whisky and banged it over his head,\" says Khaled. \"It was terrible.\" Why didn't they shoot her? \"I had grenades,\" she says, with a shrug of her shoulders. \"Eventually I was hit on the back of my head, and I lost consciousness. When I woke up I was tied up and being kicked. \"Passengers were shouting; I heard a woman scream, 'Stop the bloodshed'. But we had very strict instructions: don't hurt the passengers. Only defend yourselves.\" But the grenades would have hurt the passengers, had she released them. \"I did not want to blow up the plane,\" she says, sternly. \"It was only to threaten.\" (While the PFLP was involved in other controversial armed actions in Israel, including some which led to the deaths of civilians, no one died during either of the hijacks in which Khaled was involved. The plane landed at Heathrow and Khaled was taken to Ealing police station where she was held for 28 days, until the then prime minister, Edward Heath, released her in exchange for western hostages held by the PFLP. Her stay in Britain was pleasant, she says. \"People were very nice. They would say to each other: is she the one? They could hardly believe it, this tiny creature sitting on the bench. I was 26 and I was very thin. I had two policewomen with me in my cell, and we were always discussing our cause and our suffering. After I left I sent them books about Palestine; they asked me to. We wrote to each other. One of them had a problem with her boyfriend, and we often discussed this.\" It's an intriguing thought: the Palestinian revolutionary and the Ealing policewoman finding common ground by discussing men. Although it is not, perhaps, so surprising. Women have always related to Khaled. As Eileen Macdonald, in her book Shoot the Women First, puts it: \"She shattered a million and one taboos overnight and she revolutionised the thinking of hundreds of other angry young women around the world.\" She flamboyantly overcame the patriarchal restrictions of Arab society where women are traditionally subservient to their husbands, by taking an equal fighting role with men, by getting divorced and remarried, having children in her late 30s, and rejecting vanity by having her face reconstructed for her cause. There were difficulties with being both a woman and a fighter, however. \"In the beginning, all women had to prove that we could be equal to men in armed struggle,\" says Khaled. \"So we wanted to be like men - even in our appearance.\" Robin Morgan, in her book, The Demon Lover: The Sexuality of Terrorism, writes about how Khaled lost out in two ways. The men in her organisation resented the attention she got, while women were frustrated that she never spoke about women, only about the revolution. (She once said, \"I represent Palestinians, not women.\") This has echoes of something Mairead Farrell, the IRA volunteer who was shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar in 1988, once said: \"I'm oppressed as a woman, but I'm also oppressed because I'm Irish ... We can't succesfully end our oppression as women until we first end the oppression of our country.\" But things seem to have changed for Khaled. \"I no longer think it's necessary to prove ourselves as women by imitating men,\" she says. \"I have learned that a woman can be a fighter, a freedom fighter, a political activist, and that she can fall in love, and be loved, she can be married, have children, be a mother. \"You see, at the beginning we were only interested in the revolution. We were not mature enough politically. The question of women is a part of our struggle but not the only part. Revolution must mean life also; every aspect of life.\" Is she a Palestinian first, or a woman first? \"I cannot differentiate,\" she says. \"A woman and a Palestinian at the same time.\" Khaled was born in Haifa, now on the Israeli coast, but became a refugee with her family at a camp in Tyre, Lebanon, as a toddler in 1948. (During her 1969 hijacking of the TWA flight she forced the pilot to fly over Haifa, so that she could look at the home town she was not permitted to visit.) She can barely recall a time when she was not politicised: she remembers at the age of four being told by her mother not to pick oranges because they were in Lebanon; the fruit was not theirs, they were not in Haifa now. She committed herself full-time to armed struggle at the age of 15. Since the time of the hijacks, Khaled has lived in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, and has brought up two sons who are now 18 and 15. She continued her activism, first as a fighter and then as a politician for the PFLP as a member of the Palestinian National Council. (Her sons offer to be her bodyguards and when they were small really did say: \"Tell us stories about the struggle, mum.\") But she is still as radical as ever. \"The struggle of the Palestinians has taken many faces. Armed struggle, intifada, and now both. Which means as long as there is occupation in our country, the conflict will continue.\" She demands the right to self-determination, a state with Jerusalem as its capital, the right to return for refugees and the withdrawal of Israel from all the land it has occupied since 1967. \"Otherwise the purpose for conflict will always be there.\" And now? \"Now people are fed up. They are saying: now and forever. Let's do it. This time.\" What she says can be difficult for peaceniks, or pacifists, to hear - the unashamed justification for violence. Many ordinary Palestinians share her views, many politicians do not. Similarly, views on Khaled herself are mixed, even among Palestinians: some think she is an inspiring heroine, others believe she reinforces the old 70s image of Palestinians as terrorists. Is she a terrorist? \"Whenever I hear this word I ask another question,\" she says. \"Who planted terrorism in our area? Some came and took our land, forced us to leave, forced us to live in camps. I think this is terrorism. Using means to resist this terrorism and stop its effects - this is called struggle.\" She recalls in her memoirs thinking of the risk to children she saw on the plane she was hijacking, and telling herself: \"We Palestinians are children too and we are a part of the human race.\" Would she still die for the Palestinian cause? She draws on her long cigarette, and turns to face me after some silence. \"Of course.\" She shakes her head, smiling, cigarette burning in her hand. \"Of course.\"",

The intelligence was so high grade, Mr Tomlinson says he was told, that it went all the way to the White House and Downing Street. In a separate high risk operation, MI6 spirited the most advanced armoured personnel carrier in the Russian arsenal, the BMP-3, out of Russia to the Polish port of Gdansk and shipped it across, with the help of the Poles, to Southampton where it was taken apart and found to be better than anything Nato had in terms of manoeuvrability, speed, and firepower. The defector, said to have been a colonel working for Russia's elite strategic missiles forces, approached an English territorial army sergeant, in Russia to run the Moscow marathon in June 1992, with a view to defecting, according to the book. He showed up in London shortly afterwards and following a series of debriefing sessions at the Admiralty in Whitehall, the debriefing officer, a physicist and missiles expert called Malcolm Knightley - not his real name - announced he had struck it rich. \"The guy's a goldmine. We've got to get him residency,\" Mr Knightley is quoted as telling the author. The colonel, originally from Kiev, had worked in Soviet missile control for every ballistic missile test done between 1984 and 1990 and the head of the Russian section at MI6 said he was recommending Simakov's acceptance as a full defector to the then foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd. \"'His information would be invaluable to the DIS (defence intelligence service) and, more importantly, to the Americans,\" Mr Tomlinson writes. Mr Knightley told Mr Tomlinson that the intelligence went \"up to the PM. He later told me it eventually reached President George Bush's office\". \"We've hit the jackpot with this guy,\" Knightley is quoted as saying. \"He's just given us the location and layout of a new top secret command bunker set deep inside a mountain in the Urals.\" Mr Tomlinson then describes how he travelled to Moscow under cover as a businessman and attended a conference at the the most exclusive hotel in Moscow to \"exfiltrate\" two notebooks the colonel had secreted in a sewing machine at his mother's flat in a high-rise estate on the city's outskirts. The notebooks are said to have contained data and statistics describing \"perturbations in the flight paths of every ballistic missile fired from the Soviet missile test range in Kamchatka between late 1987 and early 1990.\" MI6 would win considerable kudos by sharing the information with the Americans. Mr Tomlinson describes walking through outer Moscow to visit the colonel's mother, charming his way into the flat with barely a word of Russian, covertly extracting the books, and rushing them to the British embassy from where they were put in the diplomatic bag to London. He also claims that a millionaire arms dealer working for MI6 managed to get the coveted BMP-3 armoured car to Southampton by negotiating a consignment of lower grade armoured cars for export to the United Arab Emirates in 1991.

      "trailText": "<p>Millions of pounds are unwittingly being paid by the UK's student population in taxes they don't owe, according to a new report.</p>",
      "byline": "By Rachel Gordon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Millions of pounds are unwittingly being paid by the UK's student population in taxes they don't owe, according to a new report.</p> <p>'Students: the case for making life easier' has been prepared by the Low Income Tax Reforms Group (LITRG). It says the way students are being treated is shameful and that the tax system is in a complete mess.</p> <p>It slams various government departments for producing complicated and outdated material. It also says the three departments who students are most likely to deal with continue to \"work out of their own silos\" and so don't produce a co-ordinated approach. These are the Inland Revenue, the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) and the Benefits Agency.</p> <p>Students face financial pressures as never before. Over 75% now work part time to try and make ends meets. But John Andrews, the LITRG chairman, says the Inland Revenue is still living in the age when full grants were the norm and working students a rarity.</p> <p>Mr Andrews also criticises the fact that tax matters are not part of the National Curriculum. His report raps the DfEE for the \"lack of thought being given to the tax education of this next generation of workers.\" And it says Benefits Agency staff do not do enough to make sure students understand their tax position. The current limit that most students can earn to without paying tax is \u00a34,385 a year.</p> <p>The report adds that many of the UK's employers are ignorant of the student tax position and so make unnecessary deductions from wages, which are often extremely low.</p> <p>Even though students can claim back tax, many find this a complicated process or are not even aware they area able to. All this just adds to student poverty.</p> <p>The LITRG has put forward a number of proposals to alleviate the problem. It wants to see the Inland Revenue establish a \"students champion\" who will address these issues. </p> <p>It also urges the three departments adopt \"a more joined up approach\" so that students receive the same messages.</p> <p>Other recommendations are that a student pack, both in paper and online, should be produced to explain what students are entitled to. It points out the Inland Revenue does not even have a dedicated section for students on its website. It also says literature produced by the Inland Revenue is out of date.</p> <p>Students who want to work in the holidays must fill in a Form P38(S) if they are to be exempt from tax. The forms should be supplied by the employer, although many, particularly smaller firms, do not know they exist. </p> <p>Many students also work in the term time to support themselves. But the P38 (S) does not apply to this and so even though the money earned is unlikely to exceed allowances, some students are being taxed. The LITRG is calling for the Inland Revenue to clarify the rules on term time working.</p> <p>The main student leaflet produced by the Inland Revenue, called IR60, was last revised in June 1997. This was before the current loan system was introduced. This leaflet also does not focus on mature or overseas students.</p> <p>Around 12% of students are from overseas. They are entitled to certain tax breaks but many are unaware of this and don't know how to find out their entitlements.</p> <p>Mature students, who have worked previously and paid tax, can also find themselves in tax difficulties and need help with sorting out their status.</p> <p>And there are also complications with students who undertake work placements as part of their courses. They can earn up to \u00a37,000 a year and be exempt from tax. This again is not mentioned in the IR60.</p> <p>The LITRG believes the \u00a37,000 is paltry and wants this sum revised. It points out it has not been increased since 1992. The Inland Revenue does produce a range of literature to help students, but LITRG describes much of this as \"poorly focused and difficult to understand.\"</p> <p>These include leaflets, factsheets, a video and Z cards, which are reference guides that can be folded to credit card size. While the report says some of these are useful, it points out that some staff in Inland Revenue offices are not aware of them and neither are staff in other departments.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Inland Revenue hit back at accusations that they were not doing enough to help students. </p> <p>\"We sent out employers packs and they should all have P38(S) forms to supply to students. If they don't have them, then they can request them from us,\" she said.</p> <p>She explained the Inland Revenue planned to step up its outreach programme that involved talking to schools and planned to improve communication with other departments. </p> <p>\"We are looking to build on what we have already done,\" she added.</p> <p>Students can also find out more by contacting the National Union of Students. Its Information Sheet 7 provides on areas such as income tax, avoiding tax on bank and building society interest and self-assessment. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said many students were confused about tax and were not helped by employers who did not understand about exemption. \"Some students have told us employers only know about P45s and haven't heard about P 38s,\" she said. </p> <p>The sheet can be downloaded from the <a href=\"http://www.nusonline.co.uk\">NUS</a>. </p> <p>Another website, launched last week, focuses on students' rights at work, although to date does not offer tax advice.</p> <p>The Unison-backed <a href=\"http://www.troubleatwork.org.uk\">Trouble at work</a> has information primarily on issues such as health and safety, bullying and work related problems. A spokeswoman said they would be happy to respond to emails from students who needed advice on any issue including tax.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Millions of pounds are unwittingly being paid by the UK's student population in taxes they don't owe, according to a new report. 'Students: the case for making life easier' has been prepared by the Low Income Tax Reforms Group (LITRG). It says the way students are being treated is shameful and that the tax system is in a complete mess. It slams various government departments for producing complicated and outdated material. It also says the three departments who students are most likely to deal with continue to \"work out of their own silos\" and so don't produce a co-ordinated approach. These are the Inland Revenue, the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) and the Benefits Agency. Students face financial pressures as never before. Over 75% now work part time to try and make ends meets. But John Andrews, the LITRG chairman, says the Inland Revenue is still living in the age when full grants were the norm and working students a rarity. Mr Andrews also criticises the fact that tax matters are not part of the National Curriculum. His report raps the DfEE for the \"lack of thought being given to the tax education of this next generation of workers.\" And it says Benefits Agency staff do not do enough to make sure students understand their tax position. The current limit that most students can earn to without paying tax is \u00a34,385 a year. The report adds that many of the UK's employers are ignorant of the student tax position and so make unnecessary deductions from wages, which are often extremely low. Even though students can claim back tax, many find this a complicated process or are not even aware they area able to. All this just adds to student poverty. The LITRG has put forward a number of proposals to alleviate the problem. It wants to see the Inland Revenue establish a \"students champion\" who will address these issues. It also urges the three departments adopt \"a more joined up approach\" so that students receive the same messages. Other recommendations are that a student pack, both in paper and online, should be produced to explain what students are entitled to. It points out the Inland Revenue does not even have a dedicated section for students on its website. It also says literature produced by the Inland Revenue is out of date. Students who want to work in the holidays must fill in a Form P38(S) if they are to be exempt from tax. The forms should be supplied by the employer, although many, particularly smaller firms, do not know they exist. Many students also work in the term time to support themselves. But the P38 (S) does not apply to this and so even though the money earned is unlikely to exceed allowances, some students are being taxed. The LITRG is calling for the Inland Revenue to clarify the rules on term time working. The main student leaflet produced by the Inland Revenue, called IR60, was last revised in June 1997. This was before the current loan system was introduced. This leaflet also does not focus on mature or overseas students. Around 12% of students are from overseas. They are entitled to certain tax breaks but many are unaware of this and don't know how to find out their entitlements. Mature students, who have worked previously and paid tax, can also find themselves in tax difficulties and need help with sorting out their status. And there are also complications with students who undertake work placements as part of their courses. They can earn up to \u00a37,000 a year and be exempt from tax. This again is not mentioned in the IR60. The LITRG believes the \u00a37,000 is paltry and wants this sum revised. It points out it has not been increased since 1992. The Inland Revenue does produce a range of literature to help students, but LITRG describes much of this as \"poorly focused and difficult to understand.\" These include leaflets, factsheets, a video and Z cards, which are reference guides that can be folded to credit card size. While the report says some of these are useful, it points out that some staff in Inland Revenue offices are not aware of them and neither are staff in other departments. A spokeswoman for the Inland Revenue hit back at accusations that they were not doing enough to help students. \"We sent out employers packs and they should all have P38(S) forms to supply to students. If they don't have them, then they can request them from us,\" she said. She explained the Inland Revenue planned to step up its outreach programme that involved talking to schools and planned to improve communication with other departments. \"We are looking to build on what we have already done,\" she added. Students can also find out more by contacting the National Union of Students. Its Information Sheet 7 provides on areas such as income tax, avoiding tax on bank and building society interest and self-assessment. A spokeswoman said many students were confused about tax and were not helped by employers who did not understand about exemption. \"Some students have told us employers only know about P45s and haven't heard about P 38s,\" she said. The sheet can be downloaded from the NUS. Another website, launched last week, focuses on students' rights at work, although to date does not offer tax advice. The Unison-backed Trouble at work has information primarily on issues such as health and safety, bullying and work related problems. A spokeswoman said they would be happy to respond to emails from students who needed advice on any issue including tax.",

With celestial backing vocals from Bryan Mills, a military drum tattoo and a spiralling keyboard melody closely related to Can's I Want More, for once the Divine Comedy felt like a band rather than a singer and his backing musicians. There is much work to be done here, but the cause is not wholly irretrievable.",

In Leeds, Dean's current trio continued their leader's dogged 30-year quest by defiantly making a huge racket in front of a handful of people and eliciting a somewhat mixed response. </p> <p>The first half of the show was hard work, with drummer Mark Sanders and double-bass player John Edwards beating us over the head with death-defying acts of virtuosity. The steamrolling power was relentless, but somehow the band missed its target - if indeed it had one. Improvised music is principally not about melody, rhythm or harmony but about generating and swapping vast amounts of energy, and in this sense the performance was faultless. However, a distressing lack of space and sunshine quickly became evident, with none of the instruments quite managing to tell a story. </p> <p>Dean is an unassuming figure, and sometimes his tastefully restrained playing was in danger of being overwhelmed by the agitated and impersonal clatter of his rhythm section. The three instruments played non-stop for over half an hour, somehow succeeding in roaring as a whole while simultaneously trying to break away from each other's tangled orbit. </p> <p>Some members of the audience appeared glum, and most looked pensive. One restless soul at the back of the room did his best to instigate a round of applause whenever the noise thinned out slightly, but no one took his cue, and it was only a matter of time before we were plunged once more into the seething hurricane. </p> <p>Salvation beckoned in the second half as spaces were finally left open, and one truly thrilling groove was established by Sanders's belated decision to quit his tom-toms and stick to the bare-bone jazz essentials of cymbals and bass drum - played at breakneck speed, of course. </p> <p>Now we could stop wringing our hands and properly enjoy Edwards's almost comical assault on his double bass, his performance winding up more physical than musical. </p> <p>Eventually, Dean's vastly accomplished ensemble hit the spot and everyone was happy - apart from the cowards who left at the interval.</p>",

Salvation beckoned in the second half as spaces were finally left open, and one truly thrilling groove was established by Sanders's belated decision to quit his tom-toms and stick to the bare-bone jazz essentials of cymbals and bass drum - played at breakneck speed, of course. Now we could stop wringing our hands and properly enjoy Edwards's almost comical assault on his double bass, his performance winding up more physical than musical. Eventually, Dean's vastly accomplished ensemble hit the spot and everyone was happy - apart from the cowards who left at the interval.",
