      "byline": "Vivek Chaudhary",

      "body": "<p>A country that counts volcanoes, geysers and hot springs among its tourist attractions is accustomed to explosions. </p> <p>A country whose national team have never qualified for the finals of a major championship, where average league attendances are 900 and where there are no full-time professional footballers is unaccustomed to success at the beautiful game. </p> <p>Fortunately for many Icelanders, their most recent explosion has not come within the terra inferna of the snow-capped isle but from the country's spartan dressing rooms and shabby pitches. It is an astonishing success story which has led to one of Europe's smallest and most isolated communities making its footballing mark across the continent. </p> <p>There are about 70 Icelandic footballers plying their trade at clubs around Europe, from the Premiership and Bundesliga to second division Greek and Italian football. In Britain alone there are 22 Icelandic professionals, and more are on the way. </p> <p>Even if the majority are playing at unglamorous, cash-strapped clubs on the lookout for a bargain, the emergence of Icelandic players on the European scene is phenomenal given limited facilities, a population of only 277,000 and the fact that the nation's footballers play on grass for only five months of the year, May to September. </p> <p>Watford recently signed the Icelandic striker Heidar Helguson; he scored on his debut against Liverpool, and Watford's manager Graham Taylor declared that an explosion of Icelandic players was about to take place. </p> <p>Eyolfur Sverrisson has been a pillar of the Hertha Berlin defence, Rikhardur Dadason and Thordur Gudjonsson have made a huge impact in Norway and Belgium, and Tottenham are said to be signing a 16-year-old midfielder who may be the best of the lot. </p> <p>For European scouts and agents there are rich pickings to be had in Iceland, whose players were barely known outside their home towns let alone their shores as little as two years ago. </p> <p>For the players rolling off the production line, the toughest opponents are often poor training facilities, meagre win bonuses and arduous weather. </p> <p>Just consider this: at an indoor equestrian centre just outside Reykjavik last week, where the soft earth is more accustomed to hooves than studs and the stench of horse dung filled the air, the players of IBV, one of Iceland's leading clubs, were undergoing their daily training session after returning from work. A couple of the players may earn win bonuses of up to \u00a3200 a game but the majority of the team are willing to play for a minimal fee, and these are among the elite of domestic footballers. </p> <p>IBV are based in Heimaey, capital of the Vestmann Islands, population 5,000, which lie just off the coast of Iceland. Half the team are in Reykjavik for the close season because of winter weather that makes training impossible and because there is more chance of finding work. </p> <p>\"Our matches often get cancelled at the last minute because of the wind,\" said the coach Kristinn Jonsson. \"Sometimes we can't get to away matches because we can't leave the island. Visiting teams and their fans sometimes can't get home. These are the conditions that our players have to put up with but that makes them more dedicated. They are willing to work harder than most other players in Europe.\" </p> <p>Five of last season's team, which finished second in the league, are now playing at clubs across Europe, including Ivar Ingimarsson, who recently signed for Brentford and scored in their 1-0 win at Blackpool last Saturday. </p> <p>Ingimarsson and his colleagues can date the beginnings of their success to 10 years ago, when Iceland's football association (IFA), sick of having nothing to cheer about, implemented a strategy to raise the nation's game. </p> <p>There was never any doubt within Icelandic football circles that the country possessed footballers with the right physical and mental attributes to succeed. The problem, the administrators felt, lay with the coaches. </p> <p>\"We felt that we really needed to work on the coaches because they are the ones who pass knowledge on to the players,\" said Asgeir Sigurvinsson, the association's technical director and one of the first Icelandic footballers to play outside his country. </p> <p>\"Our coaching methods have improved over the past few years and we made a real effort to focus on this. Our players have always had the appetite for football and the ability to do well but the coaches weren't always able to bring out the best in them.\" </p> <p>Former players such as Gundi Kjartansson, who is currently the Iceland Under-18s coach, were sent on Fifa-approved courses across Europe in an attempt to improve their knowledge of the game and study tactics. </p> <p>\"Our boys have always had a very good fighting spirit,\" said Kjartansson. \"They are very hungry, they are big and strong and they will never let a team down. But we could not always harness this tactically and that is something we learnt to do by attending these courses. </p> <p>\"It really helped our understanding of the game. Players can only improve if the coach knows more about the game than they do.\" </p> <p>The appointment of Gudjon Thordarson as national team coach in 1995 gave further impetus to the game's development. His reign also put Icelandic footballers in the international shop window. </p> <p>Thordarson is now manager of Stoke City and part of an Icelandic consortium, along with Sigurvinsson, that took over the club last year. Under his guidance Iceland moved from 63rd to 43rd in the Fifa world rankings. They held the world champions France to a 1-1 draw in Reykjavik in the Euro 2000 qualifiers and narrowly lost 3-2 in Paris last year. </p> <p>\"We cannot overestimate what Thordarson did for the national team,\" said the IFA press officer Omar Smarason. \"It really improved confidence and the rest of Europe sat up and took notice.\" </p> <p>Though Iceland languishes in mid-table in the world football league, it is rooted to the foot of the world crime league. This has proved to be a blessing in disguise for Olafur Gardarsson, one of the country's few criminal lawyers and Iceland's first Fifa-approved agent. </p> <p>\"As a lawyer in Iceland you have to spread yourself a bit thin: there's not much crime,\" he concedes. \"In the last two years my work in football has really taken off and there is enormous interest from other European clubs in Icelandic players.\" </p> <p>Gardarsson, who works closely with several Premiership clubs, represents 40 players, 20 of whom are playing abroad and the remainder lining up moves to European clubs. A 16-year-old he represents was recently wanted by Liverpool, Leeds and Watford but opted to join a first division Dutch club instead. </p> <p>Gardarsson claims that the first clubs to take Icelanders seriously were in Norway and Denmark. Watford paid \u00a31.5m for Helguson from the Norwegian club Lillestrom, but Gardarsson feels that English clubs have missed out on some bargain buys by ignoring Iceland until now. </p> <p>\"There has been a knock-on effect,\" he said. \"Many of our players were in Scandinavia and that's where English clubs noticed their ability. It's only recently that English clubs have started coming to Iceland directly but they are still slow in acting.

      "bodyText": "A country that counts volcanoes, geysers and hot springs among its tourist attractions is accustomed to explosions. A country whose national team have never qualified for the finals of a major championship, where average league attendances are 900 and where there are no full-time professional footballers is unaccustomed to success at the beautiful game. Fortunately for many Icelanders, their most recent explosion has not come within the terra inferna of the snow-capped isle but from the country's spartan dressing rooms and shabby pitches. It is an astonishing success story which has led to one of Europe's smallest and most isolated communities making its footballing mark across the continent. There are about 70 Icelandic footballers plying their trade at clubs around Europe, from the Premiership and Bundesliga to second division Greek and Italian football. In Britain alone there are 22 Icelandic professionals, and more are on the way. Even if the majority are playing at unglamorous, cash-strapped clubs on the lookout for a bargain, the emergence of Icelandic players on the European scene is phenomenal given limited facilities, a population of only 277,000 and the fact that the nation's footballers play on grass for only five months of the year, May to September. Watford recently signed the Icelandic striker Heidar Helguson; he scored on his debut against Liverpool, and Watford's manager Graham Taylor declared that an explosion of Icelandic players was about to take place. Eyolfur Sverrisson has been a pillar of the Hertha Berlin defence, Rikhardur Dadason and Thordur Gudjonsson have made a huge impact in Norway and Belgium, and Tottenham are said to be signing a 16-year-old midfielder who may be the best of the lot. For European scouts and agents there are rich pickings to be had in Iceland, whose players were barely known outside their home towns let alone their shores as little as two years ago. For the players rolling off the production line, the toughest opponents are often poor training facilities, meagre win bonuses and arduous weather. Just consider this: at an indoor equestrian centre just outside Reykjavik last week, where the soft earth is more accustomed to hooves than studs and the stench of horse dung filled the air, the players of IBV, one of Iceland's leading clubs, were undergoing their daily training session after returning from work. A couple of the players may earn win bonuses of up to \u00a3200 a game but the majority of the team are willing to play for a minimal fee, and these are among the elite of domestic footballers. IBV are based in Heimaey, capital of the Vestmann Islands, population 5,000, which lie just off the coast of Iceland. Half the team are in Reykjavik for the close season because of winter weather that makes training impossible and because there is more chance of finding work. \"Our matches often get cancelled at the last minute because of the wind,\" said the coach Kristinn Jonsson. \"Sometimes we can't get to away matches because we can't leave the island. Visiting teams and their fans sometimes can't get home. These are the conditions that our players have to put up with but that makes them more dedicated. They are willing to work harder than most other players in Europe.\" Five of last season's team, which finished second in the league, are now playing at clubs across Europe, including Ivar Ingimarsson, who recently signed for Brentford and scored in their 1-0 win at Blackpool last Saturday. Ingimarsson and his colleagues can date the beginnings of their success to 10 years ago, when Iceland's football association (IFA), sick of having nothing to cheer about, implemented a strategy to raise the nation's game. There was never any doubt within Icelandic football circles that the country possessed footballers with the right physical and mental attributes to succeed. The problem, the administrators felt, lay with the coaches. \"We felt that we really needed to work on the coaches because they are the ones who pass knowledge on to the players,\" said Asgeir Sigurvinsson, the association's technical director and one of the first Icelandic footballers to play outside his country. \"Our coaching methods have improved over the past few years and we made a real effort to focus on this. Our players have always had the appetite for football and the ability to do well but the coaches weren't always able to bring out the best in them.\" Former players such as Gundi Kjartansson, who is currently the Iceland Under-18s coach, were sent on Fifa-approved courses across Europe in an attempt to improve their knowledge of the game and study tactics. \"Our boys have always had a very good fighting spirit,\" said Kjartansson. \"They are very hungry, they are big and strong and they will never let a team down. But we could not always harness this tactically and that is something we learnt to do by attending these courses. \"It really helped our understanding of the game. Players can only improve if the coach knows more about the game than they do.\" The appointment of Gudjon Thordarson as national team coach in 1995 gave further impetus to the game's development. His reign also put Icelandic footballers in the international shop window. Thordarson is now manager of Stoke City and part of an Icelandic consortium, along with Sigurvinsson, that took over the club last year. Under his guidance Iceland moved from 63rd to 43rd in the Fifa world rankings. They held the world champions France to a 1-1 draw in Reykjavik in the Euro 2000 qualifiers and narrowly lost 3-2 in Paris last year. \"We cannot overestimate what Thordarson did for the national team,\" said the IFA press officer Omar Smarason. \"It really improved confidence and the rest of Europe sat up and took notice.\" Though Iceland languishes in mid-table in the world football league, it is rooted to the foot of the world crime league. This has proved to be a blessing in disguise for Olafur Gardarsson, one of the country's few criminal lawyers and Iceland's first Fifa-approved agent. \"As a lawyer in Iceland you have to spread yourself a bit thin: there's not much crime,\" he concedes. \"In the last two years my work in football has really taken off and there is enormous interest from other European clubs in Icelandic players.\" Gardarsson, who works closely with several Premiership clubs, represents 40 players, 20 of whom are playing abroad and the remainder lining up moves to European clubs. A 16-year-old he represents was recently wanted by Liverpool, Leeds and Watford but opted to join a first division Dutch club instead. Gardarsson claims that the first clubs to take Icelanders seriously were in Norway and Denmark. Watford paid \u00a31.5m for Helguson from the Norwegian club Lillestrom, but Gardarsson feels that English clubs have missed out on some bargain buys by ignoring Iceland until now. \"There has been a knock-on effect,\" he said. \"Many of our players were in Scandinavia and that's where English clubs noticed their ability. It's only recently that English clubs have started coming to Iceland directly but they are still slow in acting. Watford could have signed Helguson for \u00a3300,000 three years ago if they'd moved quicker.\" The cost-effectiveness of Icelandic players in an increasingly inflated European transfer market also makes them attractive to clubs continually looking to save money and unearth a cost-price gem. Icelandic clubs, suffering from poor gates and low turnover, have been quick to seize on the demand for their players knowing that their style, strength and pace suit the English game in particular. Iceland is rapidly emerging as a sellers' market with clubs openly proclaiming their intention to produce as many players as possible with the aim of selling them abroad. The Icelandic champions KR Reykjavik, the biggest club in the country, recently floated on the stock market stating their intention to sell or loan out as many of their players as possible. Last season an average of four to five scouts from around Europe attended their home games. With an annual turnover of \u00a3650,000 and an average home gate of 2,500, the highest in Iceland, KR nevertheless generate almost 50% of their revenue from the sale or loan of players. Of last season's championship-winning team, one player has been sold to Preston North End, two loaned to Stoke City, one sold to a Norwegian club, one loaned to a Belgian club, two are on loan at a Greek club with a view to a permanent move and three recently returned from a loan spell at a German second division club. \"Clubs know they can get a good honest player for a good price,\" said their chief executive Magnus Orri Schram. \"Technically our players are very good and they are willing to work hard. They are a manager's dream.\" Iceland's football explosion looks set to continue and, for the man responsible for touting his country's young talent to clubs across Europe, the reasons may be a lot simpler than originally thought. Not only are they big, strong and exhibit Viking characteristics but, joked Gardarsson: \"Our boys do not complain about the food, they do not complain about the weather, they are used to hard work and they all talk English.\"",

Mr Blair interrupted his tour of Devon to make several phone calls. He spoke twice to Mr Mandelson and had two lengthy conversations with Mr Ahern.

The Ulster Unionists have warned that they will destroy the power-sharing administration by walking out if the government does not suspend the devolution in the IRA decommissioning. With Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's post-dated letter of resignation to his party's ruling council due to take effect tomorrow, ministers are clearly running out of time.

      "bodyText": "Austrian president Thomas Klestil agreed to swear in a coalition government including J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party despite an international outcry and threats of political isolation by Austria's European partners. Klestil's office said the ceremony will take place at noon on Friday. The head of state was clearly reluctant to sanction the new coaltion. Mr Klestil made his feelings plain yesterday, saying he would approve the coalition only against his better judgment because he feared Austria would suffer internationally. \"If I were to swear in this government, I would not do it out of personal conviction, because I fear that Austria would suffer internationally,\" Mr Klestil told NEWS magazine. But, he added: \"In a democracy, a parliamentary majority has to be respected. Personal preferences do not count.\" Mr Haider's Freedom party and Mr Schuessel's People's party hold 104 seats in the 183-seat parliament. Mr Klestil cannot call a new election unless parliament first votes to dissolve itself The announcement is likely to trigger a series of diplomatic measures against Austria by the rest of the European Union, which warned Vienna that its EU membership could be suspended if the government veers from European standards of democracy and human rights. Earlier today, Conservative leader Wolfgang Schuessel and Mr Haider formalised a coalition pact today and issued an unprecedented declaration committing the coalition to the basic principles of European democracy. They also signed a document, \"Responsibility for Austria - A future in the heart of Europe\", was intended to reassure other nations that a coalition including Mr Haider's party would remain committed to the EU, human rights, and western democratic values. The signing took place in the Hofburg Palace, Vienna, against a backdrop of whistles from protestors outside the palace. \"Nobody has to fear anything in Austria,\" Mr Haider told a joint news conference with Mr Schuessel. \"We will try to convince the international community that the new government is a reform government.\" Mr Schuessel and Mr Haider's joint declaration pledged that their federal government would maintain an \"unswerving adherence to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of the peoples of Europe and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law, principles which form the basis of all genuine democracy.\" \"The federal government works for an Austria in which xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism have no place,\" it added. Austria's future chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel has \"dirtied his hands\" by joining far-right leader Joerg Haider in a \"scandalous\" government pact, French European affairs minister Pierre Moscovici said.",

In a plea to unite the country Mr Blair repeated his view that the north-south divide is less important than differences within regions and hit out at those those \"who seek to divide town and country\". The speech to businessmen at Exeter University marked the first stage of his planned two-day visit to Devon and Cornwall after criticisms that his Government was neglecting rural Britain. The prime minister said that while farming needed short term assistance, people in the countryside were more likely to be working in booming service sector or technology jobs than those in the cities. \"The idea that the whole of rural Britain is declining is to undersell its real achievement,\" he said. On his arrival, he was met by a handful of protesting farmers.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday pressed ahead with its plans to hand failing schools over to the private sector as it ordered intervention in three poorly performing Labour-controlled education authorities - including the Sheffield constituency of the education secretary, David Blunkett. Ministers announced a big recruitment drive to hire more consultants to help with the expected increase in interventions, following the publication of three highly critical reports by the schools watchdog, Ofsted, into education services in Leeds, Rotherham and Sheffield. Chris Woodhead, head of Ofsted, admitted that all three reports were disturbing, but singled out the findings on Leeds - one of the biggest local education authorities in England - as by far the most serious and \"shocking\". The school standards minister, Estelle Morris, said consultants would be sent within weeks into all three authorities, but she expected significant transferral of school support services in Leeds to the private sector. Ofsted identified weak leadership in Leeds in the past as the main reason for the current \"parlous state\" of the authority.

A troubled conference call to analysts in October by chief executive Peter Job saw the share price of Reuters slide because of concerns about his leadership and the company's strategic direction. Reuters is also expected to announce plans for its Greenhouse Fund, which holds a portfolio of internet investments. Last month Reuters lured one of Goldman Sachs senior executives, David Lockwood, to head the Greenhouse Fund which was set up in 1994 and is valued at more than $1bn (\u00a3622m). Some of the volatility of Reuters share price last year was attributed to concerns about the sales growth at Instinet because of the fierce competition among online brokers for institutional business. Lorna Tilbian, analyst at West LB Panmure, said there had been long-term speculation, that Reuters would eventually float Instinet to crystallise its hidden value. Instinet was acquired by Reuters in 1987. Since then it has become the largest communications network for equity orders in the United States. The group has built a strong reputation for offering after-market trading to its leading customers, mostly large institutions, that want access to liquid stocks when most major stock markets are closed. It is expected to offer retail trading services by April. The group is also poised to enter two more potentially lucrative markets - institutional fixed-income trading and initial public offerings.

A through ball from Kanu releases Tijani Babangida. The Ajax man bears down on goal, but loses his cool somewhat and allows a scrambling Fouhami to make a save.<br />  <strong>19</strong> Babayaro is fouled five yards outside the Morocco box.

Finidi controls the ball with his right foot, and then drives it with his left. The ball flies over Fouhami and flies into the net, seemingly gathering pace as it does.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'We're creating a major, major museum of modern art and we're rethinking what that is at the same time. I think it's possibly the most thorough rethinking of how you present a historic collection.\" Lars Nittve, director of Tate Modern, laughs at his own audacity. \"That's quite a claim, isn't it? But no, I dare to say that.\" </p> <p>Nittve strolls around the office annexe behind Bankside power station, where his team are writing explanatory wall texts and arranging the transfer of artworks from the Tate Gallery further up the Thames at Millbank. He and his two colleagues in the triumvirate that will run Tate Modern, programme curator Frances Morris and director of exhibitions and displays Iwona Blazwick, seem to be enjoying themselves. </p> <p>They have the good fortune to be driving a juggernaut among cultural institutions. There has been no lack of huge building projects in Britain at the dawn of the new century, or massive claims for projects that are in reality rather slight. But the new Tate is not another folly; its consequences will be profound. It's the first national museum of modern art Britain has ever had. It also has aspirations to be the most important modern art museum in the world. </p> <p>It won't be difficult to sell the architecture of Tate Modern, carved out of the power station's brown brick hulk by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. As the builders start to pull out and the curators move in, the contrast between the vast turbine hall and the warm, glowing lightboxes and subtly designed gallery spaces hanging above makes for a surprisingly intimate space. \"It's quite friendly in some strange way,\" says Nittve, \"given that it's such a very tough building.\" </p> <p>What might be harder to explain to people, however, is the iconoclastic and radical programme of art display that Nittve, Tate chief Nicholas Serota and their team plan for Tate Modern. This museum is not setting out just to be popular, but to challenge the way we think about art. </p> <p>To grasp the scale of this ambition you have to look back more than 70 years to 1929, when the Museum of Modern Art - big MoMA - opened in New York. This was a museum that set out not simply to preserve the art of the past but to alter that of the future. When we say or picture \"modern art\", the image in our heads is one shaped by MoMA, and by one of its directors in particular, Alfred H Barr. In 1936, Barr published a diagram of modern art that defined it as an evolutionary sequence of \"isms\". The flow chart looks strange today: neat arrows connect big printed words and show how cubism connects to Suprematism which connects to Bauhaus as does constructivism. If you follow another arrow from cubism you get Dadaism and surrealism and everything meets up in abstract art. Which, conveniently for MoMA and American art, meant that by 1950 Jackson Pollock was recognised as the climax of artistic evolution. </p> <p>Tate Modern is the first institution to have the cheek to stand up to MoMA and set out to dismantle, once and for all, what curators at Bankside call in icy tones \"the Barr model\". For some time now, artists, art historians and art museums have railed against this image of modern art as an evolution. For one thing it is a story with an ending - it culminates in abstract art and everything after, from Andy Warhol to today's young British artists, becomes so much decadence. For another, it always was part of an American nationalist myth. </p> <p>Not that the new Tate Gallery plans to impose on the 21st century a new nationalist evolutionary scheme, a neat Tate wall text in place of Barr's diagram explaining how Picasso and Duchamp lead to Damien Hirst. But the new museum is as ruthless as New York was in its heyday. It looks at the history of modern art from the standpoint of London now. It dismantles hierarchies, mocks the grand narrative, and asserts that art in Britain today is as exciting and significant as Picasso or Pollock. </p> <p>When the builders started to tear the old industrial machinery out of Bankside, a team of curators at the Tate Gallery started to rethink the history of modern art and how it could be presented in a museum. Frances Morris is a long-standing Tate curator who has commissioned the nonagenarian installation artist Louise Bourgeois to be the first artist to work in Tate Modern's turbine hall. She is also responsible for overseeing the huge team installing the opening displays as art is brought in from the Tate Gallery. </p> <p>\"At Millbank there was an underlying notion of a succession of avant-garde gestures,\" she says, \"almost the Barr model. And I think we wanted to move away from that. From the perspective of the year 2000 it doesn't accommodate a vast history of art in the 20th century.\"Ever since Nicholas Serota announced his grand projet, the question of what will be put in it has been a running joke. There are reasons for scepticism; whatever the Tate says, its own earlier history - in the 30s it had a director who was hostile to modern art and so didn't buy any - has left gaps in the collection compared to somewhere such as MoMA. Since the announcement of the Tate Modern project in December 1992 there have been moves to put these right by acquisitions and loans. </p> <p> But it turns out they have been thinking along somewhat grander terms than simply filling a space. Probably most of us, even though we may go to the Turner Prize show and perhaps enjoy contemporary art, have an assumption at the back of our minds that the jury is out on this art, that it doesn't belong in the same pantheon as Picasso. Morris says simply: \"We're not trying to impose an endpoint or a dead end. We're trying to open doors. We wanted to bring the beginning and the end of the 20th century together.\" </p> <p>To get away from what it sees as the monolithic history of modern art as a series of \"isms\", the new museum will present four separate cuts through art since 1900, four separate \"suites\" of displays. These neatly fit the long, rectangular shape of the galleries disposed on each side of Bankside's big brown chimney. You won't find a progression in any of the suites from cubism through Suprematism to abstract art. Instead you will find juxtapositions of art across time. </p> <p>Perhaps the most provocative of these will be in the room in which a Picasso still life can be seen next to the most controversial artwork ever bought by the Tate Gallery, Carl Andr\u00e9's Equivalent VIII (1966), the infamous bricks which caused a bitter public row when they were acquired in the 1970s. Picasso's 1914 Still Life, a masterpiece of cubist assemblage, is a three-dimensional wooden relief representing a glass, a hunk of bread and a knife, with a piece of curtain fabric hanging down to represent a tablecloth - everyday objects, a bit like bricks, Tate Modern seems to be suggesting. </p> <p>Provocative in another way will be the showing of British painter Howard Hodgkin next to one of his influences, the French \"intimist\" painter Bonnard - one of the themes of Tate Modern's opening displays being that British art is central to the story of modern art. The contemporary American-born but British-based artist Susan Hiller gets a whole room to herself for her collection of objects and texts inspired by London's Freud Museum. </p> <p>\"One of the things that happens in museums,\" says Morris, \"is that the works become part of the history of the museum and lose the context of their making.\" One of the opening displays will centre on Picasso's Weeping Woman, one of the Tate's most treasured paintings. The museum has always shown this painting of a jagged, cut-up woman whose tears turn into butterflies simply as a modern classic. The new display will put it back in history, using film footage, photographs, posters and documents to tell the story of how it came to Britain in 1938 along with Guernica as part of a fundraising tour for the republican cause in the Spanish civil war. </p> <p>This desire, as Morris puts it, \"to make more of a connection between art and life\" informs several Bankside displays. One will examine Primitivism in France at the beginning of the 20th century, the passion for African and Oceanic masks that runs through Picasso's Cubist paintings and returns in Surrealism.

      "bodyText": "'We're creating a major, major museum of modern art and we're rethinking what that is at the same time. I think it's possibly the most thorough rethinking of how you present a historic collection.\" Lars Nittve, director of Tate Modern, laughs at his own audacity. \"That's quite a claim, isn't it? But no, I dare to say that.\" Nittve strolls around the office annexe behind Bankside power station, where his team are writing explanatory wall texts and arranging the transfer of artworks from the Tate Gallery further up the Thames at Millbank. He and his two colleagues in the triumvirate that will run Tate Modern, programme curator Frances Morris and director of exhibitions and displays Iwona Blazwick, seem to be enjoying themselves. They have the good fortune to be driving a juggernaut among cultural institutions. There has been no lack of huge building projects in Britain at the dawn of the new century, or massive claims for projects that are in reality rather slight. But the new Tate is not another folly; its consequences will be profound. It's the first national museum of modern art Britain has ever had. It also has aspirations to be the most important modern art museum in the world. It won't be difficult to sell the architecture of Tate Modern, carved out of the power station's brown brick hulk by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. As the builders start to pull out and the curators move in, the contrast between the vast turbine hall and the warm, glowing lightboxes and subtly designed gallery spaces hanging above makes for a surprisingly intimate space. \"It's quite friendly in some strange way,\" says Nittve, \"given that it's such a very tough building.\" What might be harder to explain to people, however, is the iconoclastic and radical programme of art display that Nittve, Tate chief Nicholas Serota and their team plan for Tate Modern. This museum is not setting out just to be popular, but to challenge the way we think about art. To grasp the scale of this ambition you have to look back more than 70 years to 1929, when the Museum of Modern Art - big MoMA - opened in New York. This was a museum that set out not simply to preserve the art of the past but to alter that of the future. When we say or picture \"modern art\", the image in our heads is one shaped by MoMA, and by one of its directors in particular, Alfred H Barr. In 1936, Barr published a diagram of modern art that defined it as an evolutionary sequence of \"isms\". The flow chart looks strange today: neat arrows connect big printed words and show how cubism connects to Suprematism which connects to Bauhaus as does constructivism. If you follow another arrow from cubism you get Dadaism and surrealism and everything meets up in abstract art. Which, conveniently for MoMA and American art, meant that by 1950 Jackson Pollock was recognised as the climax of artistic evolution. Tate Modern is the first institution to have the cheek to stand up to MoMA and set out to dismantle, once and for all, what curators at Bankside call in icy tones \"the Barr model\". For some time now, artists, art historians and art museums have railed against this image of modern art as an evolution. For one thing it is a story with an ending - it culminates in abstract art and everything after, from Andy Warhol to today's young British artists, becomes so much decadence. For another, it always was part of an American nationalist myth. Not that the new Tate Gallery plans to impose on the 21st century a new nationalist evolutionary scheme, a neat Tate wall text in place of Barr's diagram explaining how Picasso and Duchamp lead to Damien Hirst. But the new museum is as ruthless as New York was in its heyday. It looks at the history of modern art from the standpoint of London now. It dismantles hierarchies, mocks the grand narrative, and asserts that art in Britain today is as exciting and significant as Picasso or Pollock. When the builders started to tear the old industrial machinery out of Bankside, a team of curators at the Tate Gallery started to rethink the history of modern art and how it could be presented in a museum. Frances Morris is a long-standing Tate curator who has commissioned the nonagenarian installation artist Louise Bourgeois to be the first artist to work in Tate Modern's turbine hall. She is also responsible for overseeing the huge team installing the opening displays as art is brought in from the Tate Gallery. \"At Millbank there was an underlying notion of a succession of avant-garde gestures,\" she says, \"almost the Barr model. And I think we wanted to move away from that. From the perspective of the year 2000 it doesn't accommodate a vast history of art in the 20th century.\"Ever since Nicholas Serota announced his grand projet, the question of what will be put in it has been a running joke. There are reasons for scepticism; whatever the Tate says, its own earlier history - in the 30s it had a director who was hostile to modern art and so didn't buy any - has left gaps in the collection compared to somewhere such as MoMA. Since the announcement of the Tate Modern project in December 1992 there have been moves to put these right by acquisitions and loans. But it turns out they have been thinking along somewhat grander terms than simply filling a space. Probably most of us, even though we may go to the Turner Prize show and perhaps enjoy contemporary art, have an assumption at the back of our minds that the jury is out on this art, that it doesn't belong in the same pantheon as Picasso. Morris says simply: \"We're not trying to impose an endpoint or a dead end. We're trying to open doors. We wanted to bring the beginning and the end of the 20th century together.\" To get away from what it sees as the monolithic history of modern art as a series of \"isms\", the new museum will present four separate cuts through art since 1900, four separate \"suites\" of displays. These neatly fit the long, rectangular shape of the galleries disposed on each side of Bankside's big brown chimney. You won't find a progression in any of the suites from cubism through Suprematism to abstract art. Instead you will find juxtapositions of art across time. Perhaps the most provocative of these will be in the room in which a Picasso still life can be seen next to the most controversial artwork ever bought by the Tate Gallery, Carl Andr\u00e9's Equivalent VIII (1966), the infamous bricks which caused a bitter public row when they were acquired in the 1970s. Picasso's 1914 Still Life, a masterpiece of cubist assemblage, is a three-dimensional wooden relief representing a glass, a hunk of bread and a knife, with a piece of curtain fabric hanging down to represent a tablecloth - everyday objects, a bit like bricks, Tate Modern seems to be suggesting. Provocative in another way will be the showing of British painter Howard Hodgkin next to one of his influences, the French \"intimist\" painter Bonnard - one of the themes of Tate Modern's opening displays being that British art is central to the story of modern art. The contemporary American-born but British-based artist Susan Hiller gets a whole room to herself for her collection of objects and texts inspired by London's Freud Museum. \"One of the things that happens in museums,\" says Morris, \"is that the works become part of the history of the museum and lose the context of their making.\" One of the opening displays will centre on Picasso's Weeping Woman, one of the Tate's most treasured paintings. The museum has always shown this painting of a jagged, cut-up woman whose tears turn into butterflies simply as a modern classic. The new display will put it back in history, using film footage, photographs, posters and documents to tell the story of how it came to Britain in 1938 along with Guernica as part of a fundraising tour for the republican cause in the Spanish civil war. This desire, as Morris puts it, \"to make more of a connection between art and life\" informs several Bankside displays. One will examine Primitivism in France at the beginning of the 20th century, the passion for African and Oceanic masks that runs through Picasso's Cubist paintings and returns in Surrealism. The art in which you can see a pursuit of the \"primitive\" will be shown next to artefacts and documents setting it in the context of European empire. Tate Modern will be the first museum of this scale to give the ephemeral gestures of recent avant-gardes the same status as Cubism or Surrealism. The Fluxus group, wacky 60s art radicals who valued spontaneity and chance and counted Joseph Beuys and Yoko Ono as members, get a big display to themselves that includes a floor-to-ceiling chess set and a ping pong table. The presence at Tate Modern of Blazwick \"signals that being out there in the scene is central,\" says Nittve. A former director of exhibitions at the ICA and a prominent figure in the London art world, her brief is to establish a link between the museum and young artists. \"I love that energy in London right now,\" says Blazwick. \"I want it to somehow flow through us as well.\" Opening attempts include a display called Between Cinema and a Hard Place that surveys large-scale installations and video art and stars a host of international artists. Nittve's dream is to combine in Tate Modern the authority of a museum and the excitement of what he calls \"a stage for contemporary culture\".

Bourgeois is, says Morris, \"a symbol of Tate Modern\". The old history of modern art denied this kind of continuity: there was the great modern art of Picasso and then there was all that rubbishy conceptual stuff you see today. Tate Modern takes this attitude and chucks it in the Thames. \"It's essential to what we're doing that there will always be an element of contemporary art,\" says Nittve, \"that there will always be living artists working in the space.\" Yet there are difficulties in making a museum a centre of creativity rather than a storehouse of the past. Museums have an institutional weight that can make them clumsy commissioners of the new.

      "bodyText": "Why is Piers Morgan in trouble? The stock exchange and the Press Complaints Commission are investigating the Mirror editor after he bought around \u00a320,000 worth of shares in a technology company the day before his newspaper tipped its shares, doubling the share price. What was the company? Viglen Technology is a computer hardware company owned by business tycoon Sir Alan Sugar, also the chairman of Tottenham Hotspur and former executive of Amstrad. Where did the tip appear? In the City Slickers column written by Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, who were brought on to the Mirror on the recommendation of Kelvin McKenzie, former editor of the Sun. They revealed \"exclusively\" on January 18 that the Viglen company was about to set up an internet arm, even though this had been known since Christmas. Newspaper and television share tipsters can have an enormous impact on stock market prices, especially on so called penny shares. Show Me The Money, Channel 4's share tipping programme has had a huge impact on share-trading patterns. While it was on air at the end of last year, there was an explosion of sharebuying by small investors. The city watchdog, the financial services authority, was so concerned it issued a warning to retail investors about the danger of dealing in small illiquid stocks. The internet has fuelled the boom in retail trading with sites like Motley Fool and Hemmington Scott. What are the rules for financial journalists and tips? The PCC code of conduct on financial journalism states that even where the law does not prohibit it, journalists must not use for their own profit financial information they receive in advance of its general publication, nor should they pass such information to others. Journalists must not write about companies in which they or their close families hold a significant financial interest without disclosing the interest to their bosses. They must not buy or sell shares about which they have recently written or intend to write about in the near future. What has Mr Morgan had to say? Mr Morgan, who was forced to defend his share dealings to the board of Trinity Mirror, the parent company of his paper, said he was happy to cooperate with the PCC. In a statement, he said: \"My purchase of the shares was made six hours before the City Slickers obtained their story from Viglen's chief executive.\" Have there been past cases of financial tipsters getting into trouble? The most famous case occurred in the mid-1980s when Wall Street Journal share tipster R Foster Winans was convinced of fraud and given an 18-month prison sentence. Winans had been buying shares in companies as well as passing on the information to his gay lover before tipping them in the influential Heard on the Street column. He made only $30,000 in profits from his activities, but his case played an important part in American law on insider dealing, which eventually led to the downfall of Ivan Boesky, a leading financial figure of the 'greed is good' era. What happens next? The PCC inquiry is expected to last about a month. The stock exchange, which never comments on specific investigations, is understood to be investigating both Mr Morgan's dealings and the role of City Slickers share-tipping column, and has referred the case to the department of trade and industry. Insider dealing is an offence under the financial services act and it is the DTI that prosecutes in such cases. In the preliminary stages, the stock exchange uses computers to determine who has made a transaction and when, and can identify \"unusual\" market activity. The stock exchange refers only 30 cases a year to the DTI for investigation. The last high profile investigation into such allegations involved Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare.",

Boro will miss Brian Deane, who is still struggling with a rib injury, but should nevertheless be backed at a best priced 5-2 - or 12-5 at Ladbrokes, the best price for this particular treble. The final leg should fall into place at White Hart Lane where Chelsea have not been defeated in their last 11 visits. Sunday's FA Cup win over Leicester on Sunday extended their unbeaten run to ten games and reminded the world at large that George Weah has been allocated more skill than is strictly fair. On Saturday, expect him drag George Graham's defenders out of position leaving Chris 'missed again' Sutton enough room to open the scoring. You can get 9-1 from bluesq.com John Scales should return in time for this derby, which Spurs lost by five clear goals two seasons ago, but Les Ferdinand is likely to sit it out. He was omitted from the reserve team that played Southampton earlier this week and is likely to be sidelined for a further fortnight. Chelsea, on the other hand, welcome Frank Leboeuf back to the fold after his absence from Sunday's cup tie with Leicester. History and current form both point to the visitors, who have been priced at 6-4 with Ladbrokes. Recommended treble Derby v Sheffield Wednesday - away win Leicester v Middlesbrough - away win Tottenham v Chelsea - away win",

How on earth does he survive in Hollywood? </p> <p>Hicks visited London last month to talk about his new movie, Snow Falling on Cedars (pictured), based on David Guterson's best-selling novel. He was planning to buy a few first editions and pay a visit to explorer Sir Wilfred Thesiger, one of his heroes. Hicks is a director with a hinterland - and a large and exotic one at that. </p> <p>Hicks is the Australian documentary film-maker who sprang to international prominence in 1995 with Shine, which told the story of pianist David Helfgott. It was nominated for seven Oscars, with Geoffrey Rush winning best actor. Hicks is still in touch with Helfgott and his wife, Gillian, and they met up again recently in Australia. \"They realise that the film transformed their lives,\" says Hicks, \"and I'm aware that they allowed me to do the film and that it's transformed my life.\" </p> <p>Transformed, indeed. Hicks spent a decade developing Shine. He had seen Helfgott at a concert in Adelaide - rocking, talking incessantly to himself but \"transporting the room\", and immediately wanted to know more. \"It took 10 years to get the movie made, but it was simply an idea that would never let go. I was making documentaries to earn a living, but in between them my passion was to make that movie.\" </p> <p>Raising the money - all $4m of it - was tricky, but the movie was an instant hit at the Sundance film festival, eventually grossed more than $100m and made Hicks a hot property in Hollywood. \"Suddenly I was bombarded with scripts and ideas. I said I'd read this wonderful book, Snow Falling on Cedars, and started to have discussions with Universal, who had optioned it. Ron Bass was slated to write it, but he's a very busy writer and it took more than a year before the screenplay came in. During that year I got hundreds of offers but nothing quite measured up to this. Finally, about a week after the Oscars in 1997 - which was the end of that glorious ride with Shine - in came an offer from Universal to direct.\" </p> <p>Hicks is 46, long-haired, a Holly wood outsider who chose not to relocate to the US after Shine's success . (He lives in Adelaide with his wife and two children.) Moving from that carefully nurtured, small-budget movie to the world of big studios and megabucks could have been a nightmare. So? \"I took a decision very early on that I was not going to let the size of the juggernaut intimidate me. It was there to help me make a better film. </p> <p>\"One of the first choices I made was the producers - Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall. I wanted producers who not only had an extraordinary track record but who would allow me to make the film I wanted to make, knew how to communicate with the studio and would keep people out of my way. I knew I was making an unusual film for a big- studio picture.\" </p> <p>Snow Falling on Cedars is unusual because it tells a complicated, multi-layered story largely through flashbacks. The setting is a courtroom where a Japanese-American man is on trial for murder, but there is no attempt - in book or film - at a plot-driven courtroom drama. The film aims to capture the poetry of Guterson's novel and let the story unfold through the interconnecting memories of the people who come to the witness stand. \"It's more tone poem than thriller,\" wrote one American critic. It's a fair point: the 127-minute span feels long; the film, shot over 70 days on islands off America's north-western coast, is too self-consciously beautiful; the soaring cellos that underscore the movie's emotional high spots too plangent. There is bags of atmosphere but a lack of narrative tension; the relaxed story-telling of a book is difficult - in this case, perhaps, dangerous - to reproduce in a film. </p> <p>Hicks answers these charges fluently and with no hint of rancour. He is so articulate and reasonable - \"What you see is what you get, for good or ill; that's what I wanted to make\" - that I feel guilty for not liking the movie more. \"This book has a readership that is extremely possessive about it,\" he says, \"and I felt that it was important to try and cleave as close as possible to the feeling of the novel. The atmosphere, which is so densely detailed and descriptive, seemed important to me, and an enormous amount of effort went into trying to create that feeling for the film. </p> <p>\"To me, the novel is a kind of discourse on memory and I thought this is something cinema is really well equipped to do. I felt there was a way to deal with these three or four different stories that are happening simultaneously by working them through people's memories. It's not a courtroom drama: there is a trial, yes, but the courtroom is, in a sense, a springboard into people's memories. In court, you get into the witness box and you're asked to remember. </p> <p>\"It seemed important it was not just one point of view. I felt there were passages in the film that demanded to be told from the point of view of the participants, particularly the Japanese-American scenes. I reject the notion that you can only tell a story by following one individual's journey.\" </p> <p>But isn't it just a little slow? \"It depends on the willingness of an audience to allow themselves to be enveloped in a world. As a film-maker, if you draw the audience in, allow them to be enveloped in another world where they forget they are in the cinema, then you've succeeded. </p> <p>\"The response I've got from people who really love the film is that it is like being in a trance, and you will find out everything you need to know by the end.

      "bodyText": "New shadow chancellor Michael Portillo began a buccaneering first day in the office by renouncing the Tories' opposition to the minimum wage and an independent Bank of England. Within minutes of returning to the Commons despatch box, Mr Portillo overhauled Conservative economic policy and startled many Tory MPs in the chamber by promising to \"respect the independence of the Bank of England and legislate to enhance that independence and create more accountability of the bank to parliament.\" He also pledged that \"the next Conservative government will not repeal the national minimum wage\", which the Tories were implacably opposed to when Labour piloted the legislation through parliament in 1998. A Conservative party spokesman said that the decisions were Mr Portillo's own work, following his surprise promotion in William Hague's reshuffle this week. \"The critical point is that Michael has come in and taken a look at these two issues and he has seen there was a clear direction in which our policy was moving and made a decision,\" he said. Labour MPs who had earlier heckled Mr Portillo's return to frontline politics waved their Commons order papers in delight at the news. Gordon Brown, the chancellor, welcomed Mr Portillo's \"conversion\" of the Tory party to Labour policy and wished him well in trying to get his party to adopt \"a sensible economic policy\". Mr Portillo's surprising shift amounts to a substantial overhaul of the party's economic policy. Since Labour came to power, two key Conservative lines of attack centred chancellor Gordon Brown's decision to hand over interest rate powers to the Bank and imposing the \"burden\" of the minimum wage on businesses. In a later statement, Mr Portillo confirmed the Conservatives would also seek to \"enhance\" the Bank's independence, while increasing its accountability to parliament. \"Our aim will be to reassure markets that monetary decisions will not be taken for political reasons; and also to establish more clearly the independence of the committee's members,\" the shadow chancellor announced. \"Their appointments will be for longer. The committee will be made more accountable to parliament. Committee appointments will be confirmed by parliament. A parliamentary committee will have oversight of the MPC's work.\" Mr Portillo added that the Tories had little to fear from the minimum wage \"at the modest level at which it has been set by the government.\" \"The minimum wage has caused less damage to employment than we feared. We remain concerned at the compliance costs for business, and will seek to improve its administration.\" Tory Treasury spokesman Oliver Letwin caught the reforming mood in the party, disclosing that changes to the working families tax credit were also being considered. Liberal Democrat economics spokesman Matthew Taylor claimed Mr Portillo's announcement was an \"extraordinary admission\" that the Conservatives were out of step with mainstream Britain. Mr Taylor said: \"The Conservatives no longer know what they believe in. They are flailing about to find some way back from political oblivion. \"Michael Portillo has ripped up William Hague's economic strategy and replaced it with his alternative Conservative manifesto. The battle for the Conservative leadership has already begun.\" TUC general secretary John Monks said: \"The Conservative party has clearly caught up with the public's mood as the minimum wage is extremely popular.\" Transport and General Workers Union general secretary Bill Morris called on the government to increase the \u00a33.60 an hour level of the minimum wage. \"It is particularly sad that now the Tories have accepted the arguments for a national minimum wage, the government seems happy to let it wither on the vine,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p><strong>JUST THE TICKET (FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE MISCONDUCT ENQUIRIES)</strong></p> <p>Leicester City started the week by getting themselves knocked out of the FA Cup. They then suffered three days of pain as they were harangued for being boring (in the sort of articles you read for about two paragraphs before drifting off into a daydream about paint drying). So you'd think that winning a place in the Worthington Cup final would represent a happy end to a difficult week for the club. Well it did, but the relief didn't last long.</p> <p>This morning, eight Leicester players and officials were charged with misconduct as part of the FA's fun investigation into the distribution of tickets for last year's Worthington Cup final, where there was a bit of bother between Leicester and Spurs fans in a supposedly segregated section. Steve Guppy, Neil Lennon, Graham Fenton, Arnar Gunnlaugsson and Stuart Campbell have all been notified that a rollicking is imminent, and join their team-mates Tony Cottee and Andy Impey who have already been charged.</p> <p>The Foxes' chief scout Jim Melrose, academy director David Nish and physio Ian Andrews will also be up before the beak at Filbert Street on March 15. But the Fiver doesn't think that will be an end to it. \"We must stress that it is an on-going investigation,\" FA spokesman Steve Double added. \"There are still some matters that we want to clear up to our satisfaction.\" And the Leicester players are, according to a club spokesman, \"extremely angry\", \"taking independent legal advice\" and \"will be protesting their innocence most strongly at the inquiry\".</p> <p>At least there's been some good news for Leicester - the 25 players who were previously charged with failing to assist the FA in their inquiry have been let off the hook. However, these charges were withdrawn after \"further co-operation and information\" - possibly, maybe and perhaps the catalyst for the charges - so this is very much what you could call a 'swings and roundabouts' situation.</p> <p>* The Football League have clamped down on the allocation of tickets for this year's Worthington Cup final. Players were previously entitled to 75 tickets each and club directors were allowed 100. But now only 25 tickets will be given per person.</p> <p><strong>NOT IN THE ARMY NOW</strong></p> <p>Rather than demanding the resignation of the national coach, allowing fans to burn effigies of star players, or watching the media ridicule the manager with a clever turnip photo-montage, the Ivory Coast's military government responded to their team's exit from the African Nations Cup by taking the modest precautionary step of stripping their players of passports and phones and sending them to army camp.</p> <p>It's the sort of strategic team-building exercise that Kelvin Koogan can only wish he dreamt up. But in this instance, international outrage ensued. Inter Milan complained to Fifa, while Celtic were reported to be \"trying to contact Ivory Coast football association\" about the safety of their defender Olivier Tebily with the help of a spokesperson's immaculate Glaswegian West-African French. It must have worked a treat because, according to Le Jour newspaper, the Ivory Coast 22 were freed last night to chortle at each other's passport photos, chat on their mobiles, and scarper back to their European clubs before the wrath of their nation's fans descended on them.</p> <p>The fans duly got down to business. Even though they notched up a respectable win, draw and defeat and unluckily dropped out of the \"group of death\" on goal difference, supporters' chief Francois Amichia complained that \"the Ivory Coast has a high place in African sports, and it is not right to go out in the first round\".

      "body": "<p>Want to buy a new car? Don't, at least not until April, or whenever the government decides what to do about the much publicised rip-off of British car retailing.</p> <p> \"We're telling people to wait,\" says Phil Evans, senior policy adviser at the Consumers' Association (CA). \"Most people are expecting manufacturers will bring their prices down.\" </p> <p>They have certainly been charging over the odds for long enough. If you manufactured highly desirable products, controlled who sold them, set the price they were sold at and refused to supply them to any retailer who tried to discount your price, you would be in court before you cashed your first cheque. </p> <p>Unless, of course, the products were cars. Throughout Europe, they have block exemption from the usual rules of competition, and the manufacturers, who have most to gain from the system, say a jolly good thing too. Almost everyone else says rubbish. </p> <p>Car retailing in Britain is a rip-off. The CA has been saying so for years, and now it seems the competition commission agrees. Last Monday, the commission delivered its report on the industry to the government, though it must have needed a pantechnicon to get it there. It is one of the longest and most complex reports it has ever produced. </p> <p>The report is unlikely to be published for another three months, but it is widely believed to condemn the current practice by which manufacturers control price and supply through the franchised dealer network - and help keep prices much higher than they are in Europe. </p> <p>\"Manufacturers can't actually fix prices,\" says Andrew McIlwraith, editor of the CA's Which? Car guide. \"But they control the wholesale price and set the list price, or recommended retail price. That gives the dealers no room for manoeuvre.\" </p> <p>The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which has huge political clout, is vigorously opposed to any change.

      "bodyText": "Want to buy a new car? Don't, at least not until April, or whenever the government decides what to do about the much publicised rip-off of British car retailing. \"We're telling people to wait,\" says Phil Evans, senior policy adviser at the Consumers' Association (CA). \"Most people are expecting manufacturers will bring their prices down.\" They have certainly been charging over the odds for long enough. If you manufactured highly desirable products, controlled who sold them, set the price they were sold at and refused to supply them to any retailer who tried to discount your price, you would be in court before you cashed your first cheque. Unless, of course, the products were cars. Throughout Europe, they have block exemption from the usual rules of competition, and the manufacturers, who have most to gain from the system, say a jolly good thing too. Almost everyone else says rubbish. Car retailing in Britain is a rip-off. The CA has been saying so for years, and now it seems the competition commission agrees. Last Monday, the commission delivered its report on the industry to the government, though it must have needed a pantechnicon to get it there. It is one of the longest and most complex reports it has ever produced. The report is unlikely to be published for another three months, but it is widely believed to condemn the current practice by which manufacturers control price and supply through the franchised dealer network - and help keep prices much higher than they are in Europe. \"Manufacturers can't actually fix prices,\" says Andrew McIlwraith, editor of the CA's Which? Car guide. \"But they control the wholesale price and set the list price, or recommended retail price. That gives the dealers no room for manoeuvre.\" The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which has huge political clout, is vigorously opposed to any change. It blames the strong pound for high prices, and says the dealer network is essential for expert servicing. The CA disagrees. \"There is a need for service support, but why should that have anything to do with sales,\" says McIlwraith. \"And if the fluctuation in exchange rates made any difference, you would expect prices to go up as well as down. They don't.\" It's now up to the department of trade and industry to decide whether or not to act on the competition commission's report. \"If the government fails the consumer on this, it will be the end of its claim to be the friend of Mondeo man,\" says Evans, adding that the European block exemption comes up for renewal in 2002. \"We want to see the government campaign to end it\".

If you are desperate to change your car before April, you could buy second-hand. \"Prices are the cheapest they have been for a long time, and will probably start to go up again,\" says Evans.

But now, it seems, it has all become too much.</p> <p>Naomi Campbell (pictured right on the catwalk for Fendi in Milan) has decided that she will no longer do \"the shows\", the gruelling schedule that can require a model to appear in three couture shows a day during a city's fashion week.</p> <p>Speaking in Australia yesterday at the launch of her new fragrance, Campbell, the model from Streatham, south London, said she was not planning to appear in shows in London or New York this year.</p> <p>\"I'm definitely not doing New York and definitely not doing London. Milan - I'll wait to see what happens,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I find it really stressful, doing 16 shows and then having to do fittings and dress rehearsals. I'm not saying 'poor me', I just find it very stressful and I want to chill out a bit more, so maybe it's about doing less.\"</p> <p>Campbell, 29, said she had held back from the latest couture shows in Paris and was reassessing her workload. \"I'm not quite sure if I'm going to continue doing the shows all over the world: I think I'll just pick one out of each country.\"</p> <p>Dubbed the \"black Bardot\" by the haute couture world, exposed recently for its racism, she is the world's most famous black model. She reputedly earns \u00a31m a year and has a reputation for being one of the most difficult models in the business.</p> <p>The model's lawyers were last night due to represent her in a Canadian court. She has been accused by her assistant of assault. Georgina Galanis claimed that Campbell hit her over the head with a mobile telephone. The model has always denied the charges and promised to fight them with her \"bare hands and teeth\".</p> <p>In London yesterday, Campbell's agent, Carole White, said it was true her client would be scaling down her catwalk appearances. \"Because she has launched her own brand fragrance - which is why she is in Australia - that has stopped her from doing New York and she's not going to be back in London in time,\" she said. \"She is just not physically able to do it. She is launching in Japan on February 14.</p> <p>\"She won't be doing as many shows again. A model would normally do 16 to 20 shows and she's not going to be doing that again.</p> <p>\"She still models. We are still taking a lot of editorial bookings. If she was available for the shows she would only be doing a selected few. It's a lot of pressure and she doesn't really need it, to do 16 shows back-to-back.\"</p> <p>Ms White added: \"She can cross the Atlantic three times a week. It's very stressful and it's a lot worse than being a pop star on tour. It's a very heavy schedule.</p> <p>\"She will be in New York for a couple of days, then when she comes back to London she has to fly to Paris then fly to Milan. Then she might have a day off. When she comes back from Australia she goes straight back to Dublin to do a charity show, then she goes to Berlin.\"</p>",

Speaking in Australia yesterday at the launch of her new fragrance, Campbell, the model from Streatham, south London, said she was not planning to appear in shows in London or New York this year. \"I'm definitely not doing New York and definitely not doing London. Milan - I'll wait to see what happens,\" she said. \"I find it really stressful, doing 16 shows and then having to do fittings and dress rehearsals. I'm not saying 'poor me', I just find it very stressful and I want to chill out a bit more, so maybe it's about doing less.\" Campbell, 29, said she had held back from the latest couture shows in Paris and was reassessing her workload. \"I'm not quite sure if I'm going to continue doing the shows all over the world: I think I'll just pick one out of each country.\" Dubbed the \"black Bardot\" by the haute couture world, exposed recently for its racism, she is the world's most famous black model. She reputedly earns \u00a31m a year and has a reputation for being one of the most difficult models in the business. The model's lawyers were last night due to represent her in a Canadian court. She has been accused by her assistant of assault. Georgina Galanis claimed that Campbell hit her over the head with a mobile telephone. The model has always denied the charges and promised to fight them with her \"bare hands and teeth\". In London yesterday, Campbell's agent, Carole White, said it was true her client would be scaling down her catwalk appearances. \"Because she has launched her own brand fragrance - which is why she is in Australia - that has stopped her from doing New York and she's not going to be back in London in time,\" she said. \"She is just not physically able to do it. She is launching in Japan on February 14. \"She won't be doing as many shows again. A model would normally do 16 to 20 shows and she's not going to be doing that again. \"She still models. We are still taking a lot of editorial bookings. If she was available for the shows she would only be doing a selected few. It's a lot of pressure and she doesn't really need it, to do 16 shows back-to-back.\" Ms White added: \"She can cross the Atlantic three times a week. It's very stressful and it's a lot worse than being a pop star on tour. It's a very heavy schedule. \"She will be in New York for a couple of days, then when she comes back to London she has to fly to Paris then fly to Milan. Then she might have a day off. When she comes back from Australia she goes straight back to Dublin to do a charity show, then she goes to Berlin.\"",

      "body": "<p>Still standing </p> <p>Business Opportunities Digest, a London-based magazine, appears to live up to its name, spotting business opportunities few of its rivals would dare to exploit. In this case it was at the expense of Neil Hussey of Staffordshire, who cancelled his subscription in 1998. </p> <p>Unfortunately, he neglected to cancel the standing order on his bank account. Last July, he found \u00a359.50 had been deducted from his account and copies of the magazine began arriving again. He returned them with explanatory letters, but despite three further letters to the company, including one sent recorded delivery, he has had no reply. </p> <p>\u0095Callers to Business Opportunity's phone line are greeted by a recorded message inviting them to write or fax. Consumer does both and has heard nothing since, so Hussey would be well advised to get in touch with his local trading standards authority. The moral of the tale is always cancel direct debits and standing orders through your bank when terminating any such contracts.</p> <p>C&amp;W: calls still queueing </p> <p>Last summer Susan Thomas of London sent out 16,000 brochures for a conference and asked interested parties to ring a C&amp;W phone number. Anyone who did would have been met with a blank tone; her line had been unexpectedly cut off. Over the next three-and-a-half months she spent hours trying to get through to the infamous fault line, was stood up by three engineers and received none of the promised call-backs. </p> <p>The only things that did turn up were two bills for non-existent calls. The two engineers who remembered to arrive declared the problem was impossible to fix. Then one day the phone began working without any site visit or roadworks. But it was too late to save the conference. An audience of 200 was projected, but only 56 turned up, all of whom had registered before the phone went dead or after a last-minute mailshot with an alternative BT number. Thomas reckons the lost line cost her \u00a330,000. C&amp;W has offered her \u00a335. </p> <p>Slough of despond </p> <p>The bizarre side effects of rail privatisation - which obliged one reader to spend four weeks and 10 phone calls trying to book a ticket - were recounted last week. This week, Bernard Duffy of Windsor describes the torturous process of travelling on our fragmented rail routes; and his year-long battle against the train giants shows how paltry protection is for the consumer. </p> <p>Duffy has commuted from Windsor to London for the past seven years by one of two routes - to Waterloo or to Paddington. Usually he takes the faster route to Paddington from Slough and has a \u00a32,000 annual season ticket. The ticket covers Slough and London transport zones 1-6, but is also \"valid for travel by any reasonable route.\" And so, when Duffy wanted to go to Feltham, midway between Windsor and central London, he did what he has always done - take the Waterloo line from Windsor, a journey of seven stops. </p> <p>The Slough route would have meant going to Paddington, crossing London via the tube and travelling eight stops from Waterloo.

      "bodyText": "Still standing Business Opportunities Digest, a London-based magazine, appears to live up to its name, spotting business opportunities few of its rivals would dare to exploit. In this case it was at the expense of Neil Hussey of Staffordshire, who cancelled his subscription in 1998. Unfortunately, he neglected to cancel the standing order on his bank account. Last July, he found \u00a359.50 had been deducted from his account and copies of the magazine began arriving again. He returned them with explanatory letters, but despite three further letters to the company, including one sent recorded delivery, he has had no reply. \u0095Callers to Business Opportunity's phone line are greeted by a recorded message inviting them to write or fax. Consumer does both and has heard nothing since, so Hussey would be well advised to get in touch with his local trading standards authority. The moral of the tale is always cancel direct debits and standing orders through your bank when terminating any such contracts. C&amp;W: calls still queueing Last summer Susan Thomas of London sent out 16,000 brochures for a conference and asked interested parties to ring a C&amp;W phone number. Anyone who did would have been met with a blank tone; her line had been unexpectedly cut off. Over the next three-and-a-half months she spent hours trying to get through to the infamous fault line, was stood up by three engineers and received none of the promised call-backs. The only things that did turn up were two bills for non-existent calls. The two engineers who remembered to arrive declared the problem was impossible to fix. Then one day the phone began working without any site visit or roadworks. But it was too late to save the conference. An audience of 200 was projected, but only 56 turned up, all of whom had registered before the phone went dead or after a last-minute mailshot with an alternative BT number. Thomas reckons the lost line cost her \u00a330,000. C&amp;W has offered her \u00a335. Slough of despond The bizarre side effects of rail privatisation - which obliged one reader to spend four weeks and 10 phone calls trying to book a ticket - were recounted last week. This week, Bernard Duffy of Windsor describes the torturous process of travelling on our fragmented rail routes; and his year-long battle against the train giants shows how paltry protection is for the consumer. Duffy has commuted from Windsor to London for the past seven years by one of two routes - to Waterloo or to Paddington. Usually he takes the faster route to Paddington from Slough and has a \u00a32,000 annual season ticket. The ticket covers Slough and London transport zones 1-6, but is also \"valid for travel by any reasonable route.\" And so, when Duffy wanted to go to Feltham, midway between Windsor and central London, he did what he has always done - take the Waterloo line from Windsor, a journey of seven stops. The Slough route would have meant going to Paddington, crossing London via the tube and travelling eight stops from Waterloo. But this carried no weight with the Thames Trains conductor who declared his ticket invalid because he had not travelled from Slough. Duffy was fined \u00a310 and contacted the independent penalty fares appeals service. Alas, the manager said his plea - that the conditions of carriage allowed for travel by the shortest route - was too difficult to understand and beyond her remit. She waived his penalty fare but told him he should never break the rules again. Next stop, the office of the rail regulator, which oversees train operators. The office sympathised but passed him on to the association of train operating companies (ATOC). \"Given that Thames Trains is a member, this hardly constitutes an independent system to protect passenger's rights,\" says Duffy. \"Without even asking for my arguments, they ruled against me. When I protested, I was invited to set out my arguments, then it ruled against me again.\" Undaunted, Duffy went to court to seek a ruling that his ticket was valid. Just before the hearing, Thames Trains and ATOC suddenly decided he was in the right. Duffy won a declaration to that effect and was awarded \u00a3770 in costs. \"There were times when I wondered if I was mad to continue but for evil to triumph, it is enough that good men do nothing,\" says Duffy. \"The conduct of the train companies was disgraceful and the rail regulator has proved itself a toothless tiger.\"",

Around 87,000 lucky Americans were treated for bullet wounds last year; 32,436 unlucky ones died, including a dozen policemen by their own weapons. In one typical case, a young man, Steven Fox, described feeling pieces of his brain fly from his skull after a mugger shot him. He is permanently paralysed.</p> <p>But, hey, that's business for you.

It is an opportunity for snooty comparisons with America's crude and lawless society. This drives Elisa Barnes crazy.</p> <p>Barnes is the lawyer who recently brought a groundbreaking law suit against handgun manufacturers, which were found negligent in the shooting of Fox. \"You [European] guys are so smug.

Smith &amp; Wesson is the number one seller of killer guns - and it's owned by Tomkins plc, of England.\"</p> <p>Armed crime is traditionally viewed as a social problem, but Barnes thought it was too convenient for gun makers to blame the criminal alone. Through investigation and statistical analysis she concluded that sales to criminals are a much-valued - if unpublicised - market segment sought out and provisioned by these upstanding manufacturers.</p> <p>Her calculations are compelling. Gun companies dumped several million weapons into outlets in states with few curbs on purchases, super-saturating the legal market so that excess would flow up the \"Iron Pipeline\" to meet black market demand in New York and other big cities.</p> <p>Like the company that sells cigarette rolling papers in quantities far outstripping sales of legal tobacco, gun manufacturers have a nod-and-wink understanding of where their products end up. Their market models cannot account for half the gun sales in loose-law states such as Georgia.</p> <p>Nor can industry executives fail to have noticed the requests - more than 800,000 of them - to manufacturers from the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency to trace guns captured by police after use in crimes .</p> <p>The Fox case jury found a dozen gun makers guilty of negligent distribution. The shooter's gun was never found. Unable to determine which company made the gun that fired the bullet into Fox's head, the jury ordered all the makers of .25 calibre weapons in the case to pony up $5m for Fox's care and pain.</p> <p>Fox's victory burst the dam. Several hundred lawyers - including the Costanza group, the combine of firms that mangled the tobacco industry - filed suits to make sure the gun industry feels our pain. New Orleans is the first of dozens of cities in court demanding that gun purveyors pay the cost of gathering the wounded off the streets, and the cost of arming the municipal police force in self-defence. The legal profession may finally accomplish what a cowering Congress dare not consider: shutting down firearms sales at source.</p> <p>The civil rights group NAACP has weighed in with a massive class-action suit on behalf of thousands of the wounded and dead, based on yet another theory: product liability. I spoke to one of their counsel, Mike Hausfeld, just after he returned from beating Hitler in a US courtroom. Fifty years after the war, Hausfeld's firm brought a suit against Mercedes-Benz, Siemens, BASF and others who used slave labour from concentration and prison camps under the Nazi regime. The defendants have agreed to create a $1.2bn compensation fund.</p> <p>Hausfeld concedes that the companies were acting under orders of the Reich, but points out: \"Contemporary industrial empires were made from those profits. In 1938 Henry Ford received a medal from the F\u00fchrer, and his German plants continued to provide Ford income through 1942. Those profits belong to the victims.\"</p> <p>I started with guns, but my real topic is America, Home of the Brave Lawsuit. The open courthouse is the best of US democracy, where Davids may sling their rocks at corporate Goliaths. That is sufficient reason for the powers-that-be to malign the US system of civil justice with frightful images of O J Simpson and Louise Woodward where - they imply - juries ran amok.</p> <p>Corporate Europe has good reason to fear US law. Consider other Hausfeld cases. His firm took part in securing $1bn from Hoffman LaRoche and other pharmaceuticals giants to compensate victims of their worldwide conspiracy to fix the price of vitamins.</p> <p>The action, brought in the US, has so far benefited American victims only. European governments can collect fines, but victims of the cartel are effectively out of luck under European Union and British law, even under the supposedly tough new rules.</p> <p>Hausfeld was also one of the legion of lawyers who whacked Exxon for $5bn in punitive damages for the Exxon Valdez spill. While the Wall Street Journal excoriated the courts for vacuuming Exxon's deep pockets, the $5bn hit seems to have focused the oil shipper's attention. Grudg ingly, Exxon-Mobil now spends billions on double-hulled tankers, escort vessels and new safety equipment when operating in the lawyer-infested waters of Alaska.</p> <p>By contrast, the French are still picking dead birds out of the TotalFina oil slick. I can't help thinking that disaster, whatever its technical cause, was a product of the Civil Liability Convention (which Britain joined after the Valdez disaster) - limiting shippers' responsibility for spill damage in European waters to roughly $127m. At that price, as far as shippers are concerned, an oil spill is a bargain compared with the cost of prevention.</p> <p>That brings us to Hausfeld's suit against Monsanto, filed last month. Europe's Greens flatter themselves that they forced the company to retreat from its aggressive promotion of genetically modified grains. But it is difficult to imagine Monsanto's chief executive, Robert Shapiro, frightened by a salvo of well-drafted leaflets. Rumblings of a lawsuit, however, had to disturb his repose, and added to the pressure to seek a haven through merger.</p> <p>After all, every US chemical company executive is schooled in the story of how half the asbestos industry was forced into bankruptcy court to settle several hundred thousand lawsuits that found companies culpable because they claimed the mineral was harmless.</p> <p>Alan Simpson, a British Labour MP, has drafted a law that would make GM food and seed sellers liable to legal action for any medical or environmental damage they may cause, more in line with US law. Simpson suspects that Monsanto, AstraZeneca and their ilk would be less cavalier about seeds with tweaked DNA if the companies knew they would reap what they sow.</p> <p>Where will America's lawsuit-crazed lawyers strike next? General Augusto Pinochet has shopped at Harrods in London, but has never been to Macy's in New York. In fact, since his coup in 1973, the general has not set foot in the US.

While there was no one in the literary world quite like him, with his resolute adherence to elegising in poetry, his whirlwind name-dropping in his criticism, his dandyish insouciance, he also hammed up a familiar traditional role: that of the English upper-middle-class eccentric. </p> <p>Something about Levi never quite belonged. He was a character in Oxford, a good friend of other writers and dons such as Iris Murdoch, John Wain and Lord David Cecil, but I had a comic encounter with him in 1983 which rather punctured any romantic myth I might have entertained about his swashbuckling Oxford life. I had edited a small press anthology and Levi was the only contributor who wondered who I might be and invited me to lunch. My abiding memory is of returning to his room at St Catherine's to hunt out a book and finding another occupant there. He shared the room and they had mixed their days up. This incident rather epitomised his marginal position in the scholarly world, where his books were often criticised for their haste and inaccuracy. </p> <p>He rarely turned a commission down, it seemed, and he didn't disdain popular works: I first saw him when I worked for a firm of Oxford book packagers; Levi was writing the Atlas of the Greek World, the second volume in a series of coffee table books. He would swan in from time to time and generally leave the editors tearing their hair over the gaps he'd left them to fill in. He was briefly notorious in 1988 for claiming a Shakespeare discovery, a trap that seems to lie in wait for Oxonian eccentrics. The episode was short-lived, probably merely a stunt to sell his Shakespeare biography, but it harmed his reputation; the work in question was obviously by a minor poet, one William Skipwith, as it transpired. </p> <p>As a reviewer and poetry critic his impulsiveness could be much more productive. He read very widely and books like The Noise Made By Poems were inspiring in their confident ranging over European poetry. His mode of reviewing was entirely his own and he continued to write them in longhand throughout this career. When his first piece for me at Poetry Review in 1986 went missing in the post, he offered to write it again, and he did: \"I liked it better second time round,\" he said. \"At the end of June I was falling over myself in the annual attempt to become a more serious critic, but now it is 'August for the people and their favourite islands'. \" </p> <p>Levi was born in Ruislip, Middlesex. His father was a Jewish merchant who had converted to Catholicism, and Catholicism was at the centre of Levi's life until 1977. He was educated by the Christian Brothers and ordained as a Jesuit priest in 1964. His education was interrupted by polio while at school and a serious car crash while at Oxford. He said that the two long periods of recuperation encouraged his magpie reading habits: \"dilettantism was thrust upon me\". After graduation he taught at Campion Hall, Oxford, and undertook pastoral work. In 1977 he married Cyril Connnolly's widow, Deirdre (Connolly had died in 1974), and left the Jesuits. Levi had been in love with Deirdre for many years and had wrestled with his destiny before making the break with the priesthood. </p> <p>Levi was Oxford professor of poetry from 1984-89, and for a while I thought he might become Poet Laureate when John Betjeman died. They had a few things in common, though Levi might have been thought to lack the common touch Betjeman had. But he once appeared on Russell Harty's chat show and totally disarmed everyone with his twinkling faux-naivety. Harty was interested in the big turning point in Levi's life, his abandonment of the Jesuit order for marriage and literary life. Something about the way he answered Harty's question on what prompted the change - \"It was love\" - suggested a man who'd been asleep until that point and had been woken into life. </p> <p>He wrote more than 60 books (Amazon list 34 as still available), fiction as well as biography, poems and travel writing. He travelled with Bruce Chatwin and Patrick Leigh Fermor and there is a wonderful photograph, taken by Chatwin, of a turbaned Levi riding in Afghanistan. He had a particular affection for Greece, its literature past and present as well as its archaeology. </p> <p>The face a man presents to the world can tell you a lot. In his photographs Levi usually sports gothic-arch furrowed eyebrows, a gesture at once challenging, querulous and defensive. I admired his lack of the usual English intellectual reserve. </p> <p>His reviews were always passionate and blended life and art in an often intoxicating cocktail: writing of Eliot he said: \"It is even stranger and more thrilling that at Marburg... he missed by a mere couple of years meeting the star philosophy pupil, Boris Pasternak\"; \"thrilling\", \"star\" - this kind of thing could easily be dismissed by more rigorous critics as high table chunter. But Levi gave the impression that he really was star-struck about literature and at his best he conveyed this to his readers. His own assessment of \"the most useful and pleasurable work I've done\" was Marco the Prince: Serbian heroic poems that he translated with his friend Anne Pennington. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Deirdre and by two step-daughters and two step-sons. </p> <p> Peter Chad Tigar Levi, writer, born May 16 1931; died February 1 2000 </p>",

Much of the work that is approved in these meetings is normally prepared and brokered in contacts beforehand. \"The grease that makes the cogs turn in formal council meetings is applied in bilateral meetings outside,\" said one veteran Brussels hand. \"That could be a problem for Austria and the rest of us too.\" A strict ban on bilateral contacts would certainly make it difficult for Austria to take the initiative on issues it is concerned about - which could in turn further damage plummeting popular support for membership of the union. And the 14 also run the risk of looking ridiculous, with a smiling Mr Blair, say, posing with the Austrian chancellor for an \"EU family portrait\" at a summit but refusing to meet him in London. \"What precisely bilateral means is something we will have to see in the days to come,\" admitted a gloomy Mr Faull. \"Council work will be much harder.\" Diplomats insisted that there should be no risk to the year-long intergovernmental conference designed to reform the EU's decision-making procedures to cope with the change and strain imposed by the prospect of 12 more countries joining the union in the next few years. No EU member is contemplating anything as radical as expelling Austria, but the French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, said yesterday that the EU could suspend Austria's voting rights under article 7 of the Amsterdam treaty if a rightwing government repeatedly violated the union's democratic principles.",

      "bodyText": "Kenneth Clarke, the former Tory chancellor who is now deputy chairman of British American Tobacco, today admits that the multinational company supplies cigarettes knowing they are likely to end up on the black market. Mr Clarke publicly defends the world's second largest tobacco company for the first time after the Guardian disclosed how it profits from smuggling. Writing in today's paper, Mr Clarke says it is \"faced with a dilemma\" because smokers switch to other brands or counterfeiters cash in if it restricts supplies. \"Where any government is unwilling to act or their efforts are unsuccessful, we act, completely within the law, on the basis that our brands will be available alongside those of our competitors in the smuggled as well as the legitimate market,\" says Mr Clarke. Internal BAT documents analysed by the Guardian were dated up to 1995 but the non-executive director makes no attempt to deny that the exploitation of smuggling is continuing. The all-party Commons health committee will today consider recalling Martin Broughton, BAT's chairman, as part of an investigation into the tobacco industry. Audrey Wise, a Labour member of the committee, said: \"If there was ever a case of being within the letter of the law but clearly outside the spirit of the law then this is a gem. Smuggled goods are illegal goods, so if you're deliberately making your goods available for smuggling knowingly and deliberately you are an accessory to the fact.\" Clive Bates, head of the anti-smoking group Ash, said: \"It is now absolutely clear that vicious competition for cigarette sales in developing countries has led BAT into the manipulation of illegal markets through intermediaries. \"However they try to distance themselves from it, Clarke's incredible and candid admission does mean that they are treating smuggling as a normal part of tobacco business. \"Once they started down this route, they were inevitably led into the kinds of controlling actions we see described in the memos released in the Guardian.\" The documents obtained from the firm's Guildford depository revealed widespread exploitation of smuggling around the world. BAT had previously claimed it merely turned a blind eye to smuggling but the papers show it is central to the company's operation. Mr Clarke went public after pressure from MPs for a statement. He said it was \"not in our wider commercial interests\" but blamed governments levelling high taxes on cigarettes for the trade.",

Portugal, holder of the EU's rotating presidency, insisted that such a declaration would make no difference and that any coalition involving Mr Haider would lead to the diplomatic isolation threatened by the other 14 EU governments. Antonio Guterres, the Portuguese prime minister, said: \"It is a question of principles and values.\" He warned that acting against Austria was more important than ensuring the smooth running of the EU. Mr Haider won international notoriety 10 years ago by praising Hitler's \"orderly\" employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous Waffen SS as \"men of honour.\" Mr Klestil sounded deeply unhappy in an interview due to be published today: \"If I were to swear in this government, I would not do it out of personal conviction, because I fear that Austria would suffer internationally,\" he admitted.

Mr Irving, who is seeking damages over claims that he is a \"holocaust denier\", rejected the allegation.</p> <p>The accusation was made during cross-examination of the 62-year-old author of Hitler's War by Richard Rampton QC, defending the American academic, Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books.</p> <p>Mr Rampton, questioning Mr Irving on his various \"utterances both in public and private on the subject of Jews, blacks etc\", accused him of teaching his daughter aged nine months a \"racist ditty\" when he took her out for a walk.</p> <p>The QC read out a September 1994 extract from Mr Irving's personal diaries in which the historian referred to a poem he had sung to his daughter when \"half-breed children\" were wheeled past:</p> <p>\"I am a Baby Aryan,</p> <p>\"Not Jewish or Sectarian.</p> <p>\"I have no plans to marry-an</p> <p>\"Ape or Rastafarian.\"</p> <p>Mr Rampton asked: \"Racist, Mr Irving?

The author had said: \"For the time being, for a transitional period I'd be prepared to accept that the BBC should have a dinner-jacketed gentleman reading the important news to us, followed by a lady reading all the less important news, followed by Trevor McDonald giving us all the latest news about the muggings and the drug busts ...\"</p> <p>Mr Rampton, who said the rest was lost in laughter and applause, asked Mr Irving: \"Are you not appalled by that?\" Mr Irving replied: \"Not in the least.\" It was the same kind of speech, he said, which would be given by a stand-up comic at the end of Brighton pier.</p> <p>The court was shown a video of Mr Irving addressing a meeting of the rightwing American organisation the National Alliance, in Tampa, Florida, in October, 1995, in which he talked of the \"leg end\" of the holocaust. Mr Rampton said that Mr Irving had spoken at eight National Alliance events between 1990 and 1998.</p> <p>Mr Irving said that he had no association with the alliance, had no idea what it was and had not attended events which \"to his knowledge\" had been organised by it.</p> <p>The hearing was adjourned until today.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The historian David Irving was yesterday accused in the high court holocaust libel trial of being a racist. Mr Irving, who is seeking damages over claims that he is a \"holocaust denier\", rejected the allegation. The accusation was made during cross-examination of the 62-year-old author of Hitler's War by Richard Rampton QC, defending the American academic, Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books. Mr Rampton, questioning Mr Irving on his various \"utterances both in public and private on the subject of Jews, blacks etc\", accused him of teaching his daughter aged nine months a \"racist ditty\" when he took her out for a walk. The QC read out a September 1994 extract from Mr Irving's personal diaries in which the historian referred to a poem he had sung to his daughter when \"half-breed children\" were wheeled past: \"I am a Baby Aryan, \"Not Jewish or Sectarian. \"I have no plans to marry-an \"Ape or Rastafarian.\" Mr Rampton asked: \"Racist, Mr Irving? Anti-Semitic, Mr Irving?\" Mr Irving, who is representing himself, replied: \"I don't think so.\" Mr Rampton: \"Teaching your little child this kind of poison?\" Mr Irving: \"Do you think a nine-month-old can understand ...\" Mr Rampton: \"The poor little child is being taught a racist ditty by her perverted racist father.\" Mr Irving replied firmly: \"I am not a racist.\" The author is suing Professor Lipstadt and Penguin Books over her 1994 book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, which he says has generated hatred against him. The defendants, who deny libel, have accused him of being a liar and a falisfier of history. Mr Rampton also referred to a speech made by Mr Irving in September 1992. The author had said: \"For the time being, for a transitional period I'd be prepared to accept that the BBC should have a dinner-jacketed gentleman reading the important news to us, followed by a lady reading all the less important news, followed by Trevor McDonald giving us all the latest news about the muggings and the drug busts ...\" Mr Rampton, who said the rest was lost in laughter and applause, asked Mr Irving: \"Are you not appalled by that?\" Mr Irving replied: \"Not in the least.\" It was the same kind of speech, he said, which would be given by a stand-up comic at the end of Brighton pier. The court was shown a video of Mr Irving addressing a meeting of the rightwing American organisation the National Alliance, in Tampa, Florida, in October, 1995, in which he talked of the \"leg end\" of the holocaust. Mr Rampton said that Mr Irving had spoken at eight National Alliance events between 1990 and 1998. Mr Irving said that he had no association with the alliance, had no idea what it was and had not attended events which \"to his knowledge\" had been organised by it. The hearing was adjourned until today.",

      "body": "<p>Let us picture the scene in the Panorama offices as the makers of this week's programme on the crimes and detection of Harold Shipman wrestle with the problem of how to fill our screens. It is 11pm, at a hastily convened production meeting. The room is dim, the only light spills from an Anglepoise bent over a disorderly desk (the names Shipman 1, 2, 3 etc can just be made out on the spines of a tottering stack of videotapes).</p> <p>The producer - seen only in profile, but distinctly stubbled and exhausted - exhales a cloud of smoke, clutches his head in his hands, grinds out yet another cigarette in the ash tray. The tension is palpable - the more so as a series of new faces come jerkily into (blurred, three-quarter profile) view, revealing the rest of the production team in attitudes of extravagant, almost biblical, despair. Then one bright boy has an idea. He jumps to his feet, his hand reaches for the Equity handbook...</p> <p>On the other hand, it may not have been like that at all. That was just a reconstruction, as was a good deal of Monday's Panorama.</p> <p>Like many murderers, Shipman had omitted to leave a broadcast-quality video record of his crimes. How then to represent their enormity? It might be thought, on the very day Shipman was sentenced, when viewers were still taking in the scale of his slaughter, that the mere record of Shipman's crimes, the dreadful delay in his discovery and the words of his victims' families might speak for themselves. But, for the makers of Panorama, the unveiling of Britain's worst ever serial killer was evidently not dramatic enough. Following the current vogue for reconstructions over other less vibrant forms of moving wallpaper, they chose to hire a lookalike, switch to black and white, and turn up the menace.</p> <p>Presumably they feel their reconstruction was most tastefully done, with its odd camera angles and blurry bits, its discreet visual shorthand - the sinister briefcase, meaningful desert boots, remorselessly empty phials. They dutifully showed their work to relatives, and checked its conformity with the advice on reconstructions in the BBC's producers guidelines - which appear, rather wittily, in a chapter headed Accuracy. The guidelines are in no doubt that reconstruction can be a Good Thing, as \"a great help in explaining an issue\".</p> <p>However, the guidebook cautions, \"it must always be done truthfully with an awareness of what is reliably known. Nothing significant which is not known should be invented without acknowledgement.\" Arguably, the producers complied. Assuming their favoured props were identical to Shipman's real car, briefcase and desert boots, there was no deliberate falsehood. Even so, the Panorama reconstruction was an invention. Only Shipman and his victims know what his demeanour was in the minutes before their deaths. The Panorama recon struction, or fiction, may well have conformed with guidelines but it was nonetheless pointless, cheap, a technique which, each time it appeared, momentarily reduced an otherwise impressive investigation to the level of Michael Winner's True Crimes.</p> <p>Why do reputable documentary makers do it? Partly, suggests one programme maker, because so many news and current affairs producers really want to be drama directors and are trying to get noticed; partly because of \"the fear of the talking head\" and a concomitant yearning for non-stop action sequences. Which means, rather oddly, that though it's permissible to have an entirely static drama series called Talking Heads, current affairs programmes feel a compulsion to jettison real talking heads for dramatic effect.</p> <p>\"It was done to move the story on, to make it more understandable, to make the story accessible\", says a BBC spokesman of the Shipman reconstructions. And he points out that each reconstruction was fully flagged up - for the benefit of any viewers who might have thought Panorama had had its cameras trained on Dr Shipman all along. This, of course, is the key difference between virtuous reconstructers and less scrupulous television journalists - such as the makers of Carlton's The Connection, who were fined in 1998 for faking a sequence about a drugs \"mule\". If The Connection had only been honest about its inability to tell the story without stand-ins and pretence, there might have been no trouble.</p> <p>For journalists struggling to make successful current affairs programmes without recourse to drama, Panorama's reconstructions and The Connection's fakes are just different degrees of cop-out, one approved, one unacceptable. Carlton was fined because The Connection \"deceived the public\". Acknowledged reconstructions do not deceive in the same way, but they short-change us, deal in a currency inferior to the truth.</p> <p>But then, television is all-powerful: it makes up its own rules. Nobody now dares to tell it that it can't always have what it wants. On the one hand, this means that if it doesn't have the pictures, it just won't do the programme (so that deceased or otherwise uncooperative artists are a dead loss to television). On the other, it believes simulation is, if anything, superior to reality. \"Reconstruction\" is not the word, suggesting as it does the painstaking restoration of a damaged item. Try \"hopeful guesstimate\" next time. Or maybe just \"fib\".</p> <p>The historian Daniel Boorstin sounded extreme in the 60s, when he outlined the consequences of the public's immoderate expectations of the news: the arrival of the \"pseudo event\". \"Demanding more than the world can give us,\" he wrote in The Image, \"we require that something be fabricated to make up for the world's deficiency.\" Nowadays, it is not enough to find that a doctor may have murdered over 100 patients. Unless reporters can \"move the story on\", inviting us to watch the doctor on his calls, our concentration will waver, we'll reach for the remote - and be back watching something that never happened at all.</p> <p><b>Why Heath needs to lighten up</b><br> Tiresome as ever, the young members of the Oxford Union have decided that their president, Lucy Aitkens, is bringing their debating chamber into disrepute. Ted Heath, for whom union presidency was a high point of his life, has joined the chorus of disapproval, commenting that the current debates, featuring footballers, fashion designers and musicians, illustrate \"the lack of esteem in which the public hold politicians\".</p> <p>It seems a little unfair, for in his autobiography, The Course of My Life, Heath fondly remembers how he began \"to feature regularly in the Union, injecting a little humour into speeches which, I hope, generally bore the Balliol hallmarks...\"</p> <p>In 1938, for instance, he proposed the motion \"That this House deplores the decline of frivolity\". \"I am still quite proud of the ditty I composed for the occasion,\" he writes. \"The flaw in our present-day polity/Is its lack of a light-hearted quality/So the watchword today/I think I may say/Should be Liberty, Fraternity, Frivolity\". Should the author of this ditty now be worrying about Aitkens and her celebrities - particularly as guests invited by her predecessors include Diego Maradona, OJ Simpson, Helen Gurley Brown, Gennifer Flowers and Kermit?</p> <p>If her detractors think Aitken's use of the office for self-promotion is inappropriate, it is they, not she, who misunderstand the ancient traditions of the place. Back to Heath, after he was elected president. \"As a consequence of this victory,\" he notes, with satisfaction, \"I found myself featured in the national press for the first time... the Sunday Express ran a feature Jobbing Builder's Son is an Oxford Star.\" He promptly invited George Bernard Shaw, Churchill, Charles Laughton, Stephen Spender and Lady Astor to come and speak.

      "bodyText": "Let us picture the scene in the Panorama offices as the makers of this week's programme on the crimes and detection of Harold Shipman wrestle with the problem of how to fill our screens. It is 11pm, at a hastily convened production meeting. The room is dim, the only light spills from an Anglepoise bent over a disorderly desk (the names Shipman 1, 2, 3 etc can just be made out on the spines of a tottering stack of videotapes). The producer - seen only in profile, but distinctly stubbled and exhausted - exhales a cloud of smoke, clutches his head in his hands, grinds out yet another cigarette in the ash tray. The tension is palpable - the more so as a series of new faces come jerkily into (blurred, three-quarter profile) view, revealing the rest of the production team in attitudes of extravagant, almost biblical, despair. Then one bright boy has an idea. He jumps to his feet, his hand reaches for the Equity handbook... On the other hand, it may not have been like that at all. That was just a reconstruction, as was a good deal of Monday's Panorama. Like many murderers, Shipman had omitted to leave a broadcast-quality video record of his crimes. How then to represent their enormity? It might be thought, on the very day Shipman was sentenced, when viewers were still taking in the scale of his slaughter, that the mere record of Shipman's crimes, the dreadful delay in his discovery and the words of his victims' families might speak for themselves. But, for the makers of Panorama, the unveiling of Britain's worst ever serial killer was evidently not dramatic enough. Following the current vogue for reconstructions over other less vibrant forms of moving wallpaper, they chose to hire a lookalike, switch to black and white, and turn up the menace. Presumably they feel their reconstruction was most tastefully done, with its odd camera angles and blurry bits, its discreet visual shorthand - the sinister briefcase, meaningful desert boots, remorselessly empty phials. They dutifully showed their work to relatives, and checked its conformity with the advice on reconstructions in the BBC's producers guidelines - which appear, rather wittily, in a chapter headed Accuracy. The guidelines are in no doubt that reconstruction can be a Good Thing, as \"a great help in explaining an issue\". However, the guidebook cautions, \"it must always be done truthfully with an awareness of what is reliably known. Nothing significant which is not known should be invented without acknowledgement.\" Arguably, the producers complied. Assuming their favoured props were identical to Shipman's real car, briefcase and desert boots, there was no deliberate falsehood. Even so, the Panorama reconstruction was an invention. Only Shipman and his victims know what his demeanour was in the minutes before their deaths. The Panorama recon struction, or fiction, may well have conformed with guidelines but it was nonetheless pointless, cheap, a technique which, each time it appeared, momentarily reduced an otherwise impressive investigation to the level of Michael Winner's True Crimes. Why do reputable documentary makers do it? Partly, suggests one programme maker, because so many news and current affairs producers really want to be drama directors and are trying to get noticed; partly because of \"the fear of the talking head\" and a concomitant yearning for non-stop action sequences. Which means, rather oddly, that though it's permissible to have an entirely static drama series called Talking Heads, current affairs programmes feel a compulsion to jettison real talking heads for dramatic effect. \"It was done to move the story on, to make it more understandable, to make the story accessible\", says a BBC spokesman of the Shipman reconstructions. And he points out that each reconstruction was fully flagged up - for the benefit of any viewers who might have thought Panorama had had its cameras trained on Dr Shipman all along. This, of course, is the key difference between virtuous reconstructers and less scrupulous television journalists - such as the makers of Carlton's The Connection, who were fined in 1998 for faking a sequence about a drugs \"mule\". If The Connection had only been honest about its inability to tell the story without stand-ins and pretence, there might have been no trouble. For journalists struggling to make successful current affairs programmes without recourse to drama, Panorama's reconstructions and The Connection's fakes are just different degrees of cop-out, one approved, one unacceptable. Carlton was fined because The Connection \"deceived the public\". Acknowledged reconstructions do not deceive in the same way, but they short-change us, deal in a currency inferior to the truth. But then, television is all-powerful: it makes up its own rules. Nobody now dares to tell it that it can't always have what it wants. On the one hand, this means that if it doesn't have the pictures, it just won't do the programme (so that deceased or otherwise uncooperative artists are a dead loss to television). On the other, it believes simulation is, if anything, superior to reality. \"Reconstruction\" is not the word, suggesting as it does the painstaking restoration of a damaged item. Try \"hopeful guesstimate\" next time. Or maybe just \"fib\". The historian Daniel Boorstin sounded extreme in the 60s, when he outlined the consequences of the public's immoderate expectations of the news: the arrival of the \"pseudo event\". \"Demanding more than the world can give us,\" he wrote in The Image, \"we require that something be fabricated to make up for the world's deficiency.\" Nowadays, it is not enough to find that a doctor may have murdered over 100 patients. Unless reporters can \"move the story on\", inviting us to watch the doctor on his calls, our concentration will waver, we'll reach for the remote - and be back watching something that never happened at all. Why Heath needs to lighten up Tiresome as ever, the young members of the Oxford Union have decided that their president, Lucy Aitkens, is bringing their debating chamber into disrepute. Ted Heath, for whom union presidency was a high point of his life, has joined the chorus of disapproval, commenting that the current debates, featuring footballers, fashion designers and musicians, illustrate \"the lack of esteem in which the public hold politicians\". It seems a little unfair, for in his autobiography, The Course of My Life, Heath fondly remembers how he began \"to feature regularly in the Union, injecting a little humour into speeches which, I hope, generally bore the Balliol hallmarks...\" In 1938, for instance, he proposed the motion \"That this House deplores the decline of frivolity\". \"I am still quite proud of the ditty I composed for the occasion,\" he writes. \"The flaw in our present-day polity/Is its lack of a light-hearted quality/So the watchword today/I think I may say/Should be Liberty, Fraternity, Frivolity\". Should the author of this ditty now be worrying about Aitkens and her celebrities - particularly as guests invited by her predecessors include Diego Maradona, OJ Simpson, Helen Gurley Brown, Gennifer Flowers and Kermit? If her detractors think Aitken's use of the office for self-promotion is inappropriate, it is they, not she, who misunderstand the ancient traditions of the place. Back to Heath, after he was elected president. \"As a consequence of this victory,\" he notes, with satisfaction, \"I found myself featured in the national press for the first time... the Sunday Express ran a feature Jobbing Builder's Son is an Oxford Star.\" He promptly invited George Bernard Shaw, Churchill, Charles Laughton, Stephen Spender and Lady Astor to come and speak. Few subsequent presidents can have rivalled his record in self-promotion, but it is nice to see Aitkens is having a try.",

      "bodyText": "The United States yesterday accused Russia of generating extremism in the Caucasus as Russian troops attacking the Chechen capital, Grozny, said they had captured half of the city. The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, ending a trip to Moscow for talks with the acting president, Valdimir Putin, criticised Russia's conduct in Chechnya, but said there was no point in considering economic sanctions against Russia. The Russian leader put up a robust defence of his hawkish policies. Throughout the US visit, which was the first chance for the American leadership to size up Mr Putin since he succeeded President Boris Yeltsin at the beginning of the year, Mrs Albright warned that Russia was courting pariah status internationally with its behaviour in the Chechnya war. But such warnings of international isolation were undermined by her three hours of talks with Mr Putin, three times what was scheduled, and it appeared that despite the Chechen war Washington was bent on improving relations with Russia, which are at their coolest since the collapse of communism a decade ago ended the cold war. It appeared that arms control, nuclear safety, Russia-Nato relations, and other issues were higher priorities for the Americans in their relations with Russia. Some western European diplomats in Moscow discreetly complained that Washington was being softer than some European Union countries in their stance on Chechnya. \"The fact that Russia continues the war is causing it to be increasingly isolated,\" said a senior US official. \"But we're still doing the national security business of the US with Russia.\" Mrs Albright singled out Mr Putin for praise, describing him as a \"problem-solving Russian patriot\". \"I was impressed by his candid approach to the issues we discussed, his problem-solving approach,\" she said. \"I found him a very well-informed person and a good interlocutor.\" After telling the US plainly that there could be no outside interference in matters of national sovereignty under the guise of \"humanitarian intervention\", Mr Putin stuck to his hard line on Chechnya as his forces sought to tighten their hold on Grozny. The defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, travelled to the Chechen capital where fierce fighting was still raging yesterday despite the tactical retreat from the city by 2,000 Chechen rebel fighters. The rebels' escape from Grozny to fight another day was a huge embarrassment to the besieging Russian forces. The Russian troops surrounded and bombarded the village of Alkhan-Khala west of the city where many of the rebels were recuperating before heading on to their redoubts in the southern mountains. The key Chechen warlord, Shamil Basayev, admitted he had been wounded during the flight from Grozny, but denied reports that he had lost a leg in a mine blast. The mass rebel exodus from Grozny after months of Russian siege made a mockery of Russian claims to have the Chechens cornered, suggesting that the Chechens could move in and out of the city with relative ease. It could also herald a spring guerrilla offensive of ambush and hit-and-run tactics in the run-up to Mr Putin's presidential election on March 26. Also visiting Grozny, the Russian justice minister, Yuri Chaika, said that the Russians were bringing in \"specially equipped\" railway prison wagons for the 1,000 rebel fighters he said were in Russian captivity. While Mrs Albright said she and Mr Putin \"did not mince words\" on Chechnya, the Russian leader said he viewed the US as a \"global partner\". The US side appeared wary of being over-critical in the hope of gaining eventual Russian assent for amendments to the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to proceed with plans for a mini-Star Wars programme of national missiles defence. Germany and France are unhappy with the American plans for a go-it-alone system of space interception of nuclear missiles from \"rogue states\" such as North Korea, and both Mr Putin and his foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said the plan was a \"very serious mistake\" that would undermine the ABM treaty, \"a key element of the international security architecture\". After freezing relations with Nato last year in protest at the bombing campaign against rump Yugoslavia, however, Moscow signalled that it was ready for a rapprochement with the western alliance and the Nato secretary-general, Lord Robertson, is expected in Moscow to cement a deal later this month.",

Even the IRA, when speaking solo - if namelessly - for itself, asserts that its commitment to the process is \"total\", and says it wants \"a permanent peace\".</p> <p>Look at what is happening, says Mr Adams. Irish republicanism has given up its constitutional claim to the north. We have carried the terrorists a long way, as the IRA statement proves. We are sitting down and starting to run the country rather than destroying it. We talk with the hated British government. All this shows our renunciation of the past. It is a fantastic, constructive shift. We have chosen a different track, which we can sustain up to and through the deadline of May 22, even against forays by our dissident groups.</p> <p>The credence to be given to this, moreover, is greater for the length of time over which we resisted it. When we do a U-turn, we are serious. The Good Friday agreement prescribes arms decommissioning by May, but that is not, at bottom, the point. Decommissioning, Mr Adams concedes, is achievable.

Let this objectively existing reality be sustained.</p> <p>On the unionists' side one recognises the same brand of sincerity. By historic standards it is just as startling. The reality of peace has drawn them into credible politics. They have accepted their republican enemies into power. They are starting to run the place together.

These play to the bloody inheritance which unionists believe they alone endured. But the leadership, courageously, has got past that. It sees further. The name is statesmanship. Along with the other partners in Good Friday -London, Dublin, Washington - David Trimble has manoeuvred round the easy negatives which history endorses and on which so many decades of fatalistic rumination have been lavished.</p> <p>T o this state of mind, the republican analysis could seem quite attractive. It is, after all, true. The war seems to be over. The unionists have taken their own steps towards underwriting this happy development. They have lived with the procrasti nation over decommissioning. They will swallow most of the Patten report on the RUC. The hatreds simmer, and Mr Trimble's enemies gather. But on the unionist side, there have been the same successes as on Sinn Fein's, for realism over viscera. Why can't they take one more stride along this fruitful road - which already leads so far away from the dismal past - even though General de Chastelaine cannot yet report any decommissioning by the IRA?</p> <p>To most outsiders, not steeped in the all-consuming obsessionalism of Ulster politics, this must be the way it seems. We don't diminish the importance of the arms. We read the agreement, and we know weapons have to start going. We can see the mistrust that has yet to be de-contaminated by the sincerity and the compromises already made. Having swallowed the camel, aren't unionists straining at the gnat? It is a tempting proposition. One more, final-final deadline in May - as against the possible ruination of a process that has already changed so much. When the unionists insist on Mr Trimble keeping his promise to resign if the gnat is not delivered, will the blood not be on their hands?</p> <p>People say that at this delicate time, it is insensitive to be talking about blame. Republicans, pointing to the absence of war, are particularly prone to that opinion. Mr Adams's optimism, as I say, is sincere enough; and it is remarkable how swiftly his whole demeanour has changed into that of a governing politician. But especially in this delicate end game, it is important not to mistake the matter. No amount of bluster, or axiomatic assertion, or small-print casuistry, or pseudo-statesmanship can obscure the truth that in the hour of crisis it is the republicans who are on trial.</p> <p>Realpolitik has done us proud, but there is a limit to its virtues and we have reached it. Basking in the new-found success of Adams's strategy, Sinn Fein-IRA have to take their own small step and make a decisive - though entirely incomplete - surrender. The symbolic gesture, the token handover, is the substantively meaningless but politically crucial event now required if further credence is to be attached to the promises of peace. Only in the vocabulary of IRA self- regard, which demands that their arms and nobody else's are inalienable, does that appear unreasonable.</p> <p>They say they are serious about peace. Let us believe they mean it, and will continue to deliver - even as they continue to hold, as everyone will know, a secret arsenal. Unfortunately, in the real world, it is not enough to make the promise. The unbearable discomfort of a necessary gesture is required, as proof that republicanism has really entered the world it chose some time ago to belong to.</p> <p>Everything else, at this late stage, is bunker piety, which not only Ulster unionists will rightly curse.</p>",

They will swallow most of the Patten report on the RUC. The hatreds simmer, and Mr Trimble's enemies gather. But on the unionist side, there have been the same successes as on Sinn Fein's, for realism over viscera. Why can't they take one more stride along this fruitful road - which already leads so far away from the dismal past - even though General de Chastelaine cannot yet report any decommissioning by the IRA? To most outsiders, not steeped in the all-consuming obsessionalism of Ulster politics, this must be the way it seems. We don't diminish the importance of the arms. We read the agreement, and we know weapons have to start going. We can see the mistrust that has yet to be de-contaminated by the sincerity and the compromises already made. Having swallowed the camel, aren't unionists straining at the gnat? It is a tempting proposition. One more, final-final deadline in May - as against the possible ruination of a process that has already changed so much. When the unionists insist on Mr Trimble keeping his promise to resign if the gnat is not delivered, will the blood not be on their hands? People say that at this delicate time, it is insensitive to be talking about blame. Republicans, pointing to the absence of war, are particularly prone to that opinion. Mr Adams's optimism, as I say, is sincere enough; and it is remarkable how swiftly his whole demeanour has changed into that of a governing politician. But especially in this delicate end game, it is important not to mistake the matter. No amount of bluster, or axiomatic assertion, or small-print casuistry, or pseudo-statesmanship can obscure the truth that in the hour of crisis it is the republicans who are on trial. Realpolitik has done us proud, but there is a limit to its virtues and we have reached it. Basking in the new-found success of Adams's strategy, Sinn Fein-IRA have to take their own small step and make a decisive - though entirely incomplete - surrender. The symbolic gesture, the token handover, is the substantively meaningless but politically crucial event now required if further credence is to be attached to the promises of peace. Only in the vocabulary of IRA self- regard, which demands that their arms and nobody else's are inalienable, does that appear unreasonable. They say they are serious about peace. Let us believe they mean it, and will continue to deliver - even as they continue to hold, as everyone will know, a secret arsenal. Unfortunately, in the real world, it is not enough to make the promise. The unbearable discomfort of a necessary gesture is required, as proof that republicanism has really entered the world it chose some time ago to belong to. Everything else, at this late stage, is bunker piety, which not only Ulster unionists will rightly curse.",

I am an experienced practice nurse. Due to the unprofessional behaviour of a GP, towards myself and many patients, I reported a serious incident to the GMC and the health authority.</p> <p>The complaint to the GMC was rejected because the \"information you provided did not raise sufficient concern\". I was expected to find and organise the witnesses because the GMC \"have no powers of investigation\". None of the patients involved were aware of any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Many nurses have reported serious matters to the GMC, with little effect except on their own health and stress levels. I am sure the Shipman public inquiry will show that a number of health professionals tried to voice their concerns. I was able to leave the single-GP surgery; most patients are not so fortunate, especially the elderly.</p> <p><b>Name and address supplied</b><br><br>In my group practice of 6,000 patients we have a small number of sudden unexpected deaths at home each year. Unless there is a very obvious cause, eg a history of repeated heart attacks, we would feel unable to issue a death certificate and would refer the case to the coroner for a post-mortem examination. A new worrying trend is that, in such circumstances, we now routinely receive a call from the coroner's officer trying to persuade us to issue a certificate. We have no doubt this is a cost-cutting exercise to reduce the number of post-mortems, but are concerned that suspicious deaths could be easily overlooked.</p> <p><b>Dr Robin Gleek</b><br>Tarporley, Cheshire<br>rgleek@aol.com<br><br><br>Stuart Horner is right (Death made too easy, February 1). My 29-year-old brother was found dead in unexplained circumstances and we, his family, were told by the coroner that the cause of death was \"unascertainable\". Only the intervention of our solicitor forced the authorities to carry out an autopsy which led to the \"unascertainable\" cause of death being discovered and the instigation of a police investigation. We are a working-class family and my brother was found dead in a hostel. I wonder if that had anything to do with our experiences?</p> <p><b>Russell Burrows</b><br>London<br><br><br>My husband died suddenly at 39. I asked for a post-mortem; I was told there was \"no need\"; no underlying cause of death was entered on his death certificate; his death was not reported. Only two and a half years later, did I discover there were two different causes of death on record: one in the mortality statistics, and one in the cremation forms. This latter \"cause\" had no evidence whatever to support it, and the hospital concerned has since acknowledged that. One aspect that has upset me in particular is the laissez faire attitude, the hallmark perhaps of self-regulation. Greater accountability and monitoring of all those involved in such procedures is essential.</p> <p><b>Liz Stevenson</b><br>Edinburgh<br><br><br>I have been a medical referee to a crematorium for 12 years. About \u00a332m is spent each year on fees to doctors for completing forms or post-mortems. This money would be much better spent on a system of medical examiners covering a wide area. This team could audit all death certificates, recording the doctor involved and the cause and the location of death, and undertake audits of case notes etc, both on the basis of suspicion and randomly. This team could also advise coroners and health authorities and pull together the present disorganised arrangements.</p> <p><b>Dr Gordon Pledger</b><br>Morpeth, Northumberland</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dr Moira Baird (Letters, February 2) is correct that a code of conduct obliges nurses to report \"to an appropriate authority\" any circumstances which could jeopardise care of patients. I am an experienced practice nurse. Due to the unprofessional behaviour of a GP, towards myself and many patients, I reported a serious incident to the GMC and the health authority. The complaint to the GMC was rejected because the \"information you provided did not raise sufficient concern\". I was expected to find and organise the witnesses because the GMC \"have no powers of investigation\". None of the patients involved were aware of any wrongdoing. Many nurses have reported serious matters to the GMC, with little effect except on their own health and stress levels. I am sure the Shipman public inquiry will show that a number of health professionals tried to voice their concerns. I was able to leave the single-GP surgery; most patients are not so fortunate, especially the elderly. Name and address supplied In my group practice of 6,000 patients we have a small number of sudden unexpected deaths at home each year. Unless there is a very obvious cause, eg a history of repeated heart attacks, we would feel unable to issue a death certificate and would refer the case to the coroner for a post-mortem examination. A new worrying trend is that, in such circumstances, we now routinely receive a call from the coroner's officer trying to persuade us to issue a certificate. We have no doubt this is a cost-cutting exercise to reduce the number of post-mortems, but are concerned that suspicious deaths could be easily overlooked. Dr Robin Gleek Tarporley, Cheshire rgleek@aol.com Stuart Horner is right (Death made too easy, February 1). My 29-year-old brother was found dead in unexplained circumstances and we, his family, were told by the coroner that the cause of death was \"unascertainable\". Only the intervention of our solicitor forced the authorities to carry out an autopsy which led to the \"unascertainable\" cause of death being discovered and the instigation of a police investigation. We are a working-class family and my brother was found dead in a hostel. I wonder if that had anything to do with our experiences? Russell Burrows London My husband died suddenly at 39. I asked for a post-mortem; I was told there was \"no need\"; no underlying cause of death was entered on his death certificate; his death was not reported. Only two and a half years later, did I discover there were two different causes of death on record: one in the mortality statistics, and one in the cremation forms. This latter \"cause\" had no evidence whatever to support it, and the hospital concerned has since acknowledged that. One aspect that has upset me in particular is the laissez faire attitude, the hallmark perhaps of self-regulation. Greater accountability and monitoring of all those involved in such procedures is essential. Liz Stevenson Edinburgh I have been a medical referee to a crematorium for 12 years. About \u00a332m is spent each year on fees to doctors for completing forms or post-mortems. This money would be much better spent on a system of medical examiners covering a wide area. This team could audit all death certificates, recording the doctor involved and the cause and the location of death, and undertake audits of case notes etc, both on the basis of suspicion and randomly. This team could also advise coroners and health authorities and pull together the present disorganised arrangements. Dr Gordon Pledger Morpeth, Northumberland",

      "bodyText": "Italy is reeling from claims that its aid mission to help Kosovan refugees was hijacked by corrupt officials who colluded with the Albanian mafia after years of siphoning funds from other disaster relief efforts. The head of the mission and three other officials have been arrested on suspicion of systematic embezzlement, false accounting and bribery - igniting fury that up to \u00a340m of private donations to help those fleeing last year's war in Kosovo may have been misappropriated. The accused are alleged to be a tight-knit group within the civil defence who pulled off similar scams after a 1997 earthquake in the centre of Italy and 1998 floods in the south. The investigation into the Albanian mission is the most serious of three inquiries into aid to Albania which have uncovered mounting evidence of systematic corruption. The government-sponsored Rainbow Mission to Albania was a source of national pride after it quickly set up 10 camps to accommodate 25,000 Kosovans who fled Serb ethnic cleansers and Nato bombing. But prosecutors believe that the camp in Vlore, a near-lawless coastal town, was turned into a money-making machine for those who ran it. They are accused of diverting humanitarian aid supplies to the black market, accepting bribes from contractors, paying excessively high prices for services, billing for non-existent vehicles and falsifying the accounts to try to cover their tracks. Gangsters were allegedly allowed to drive off with entire kitchens, use the medical facilities and loot equipment. The four officials - including Luciano Tenaglia, the camp's manager, and Massimo Simonelli, the field director of the mission to Albania - deny serious wrongdoing. Mr Simonelli admits falsifying accounts, but denies personally accepting any money. Last June and July they helped Rhami Isufi, an Albanian businessman, to steal bathroom fittings, thousands of kilos of pasta and other supplies, said Michele Emiliano, a prosecutor in Bari, south Italy. Camp volunteers claim they heard officials discuss the possibility of making large gains, and hoping that the government would extend the mission to Kosovo after the war. Prosecutors have concentrated on Vlore, which accommodated 5,200 refugees before being handed over to the Albanian government last April - but have not ruled out investigating the other camps. Pressure to launch an inquiry started last September after Italian television aired a cook's amateur video footage showing dozens of Albanians looting the Vlore camp while officials stood by. \"The generosity of Italians has been betrayed. Our country is shamed. The government allowed our contributions to be managed by the Albanian mafia,\" said Enrico La Loggia, a senator of the opposition Forza Italia party. Members of the public who responded to the government's plea last year for donations to help refugees are incandescent. After months of insisting all was well, Massimo D'Alema, the prime minister, has admitted he underestimated the accusations. The minister in charge of civil defence, Franco Barberi, has been demoted. Mr D'Alema has attempted to deflect criticism. He met a class of primary school children who demanded the return of their \u00a3100 donation. Disbelief turned to fury when investigators said the officials were a well-established team that had worked together on earthquake and flood relief efforts. They were \"steadily engaged in illegal activities\", said Daniela Rinaldi, a Bari judge. The scandal is blamed on the government's desire to court popularity by being seen to set up and control its own aid effort, rather than passing on the donations to non-governmental agencies that had worked in Albania before. \"There is no doubt that the Rainbow Mission was a political decision, not an operational one,\" said Gianfranco Schiavone, of the Italian Consortium for Solidarity. Two other investigations have compounded the disillusionment with aid efforts in Albania. Some 914 containers of goods donated from Italy and other European countries never left Bari port. Mismanagement, possibly criminal, is blamed for the fiasco.",

      "bodyText": "One of the last taboos of modern Israel was shattered yesterday when its nuclear weapons programme was debated for the first time in the country's parliament. Amid noisy protests, Israel was said to have stockpiled up to 300 bombs, developed with the help of the South African apartheid regime, and it planned to adapt submarines recently bought from Germany to carry nuclear missiles. The historic debate was initiated by Issam Mahoul, an Arab member of the Knesset from the leftwing Hadash group. The government reluctantly allowed the debate to proceed after he threatened to appeal to the supreme court. Repeatedly referring to Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli nuclear technician who was jailed for 18 years in 1986 for revealing Israeli nuclear secrets, Mr Mahoul accused successive governments of \"fraud, lies and deceit\", in which the media and academia had collaborated, \"to brainwash and drug the public\". According to experts' estimates, he said, Israel's stock of nuclear weapons had increased to what he called \"the insane amount of 200-300\". He alleged that the purpose of the German-built submarines was \"to cruise deep in the sea and constitute a 'second strike' force in the event that Israel is attacked with nuclear weapons\". He added: \"That means, that not only do the hundreds of nuclear bombs that Israel possesses not pose [as] a defence, they actually caused the military establishment to fear a nuclear early strike, which escalates the spiral of the non-conventional arms race further and further, at the cost of billions of dollars.\" The nuclear reactor at Dimona in the Negev desert had produced a huge amount of nuclear waste which, if leaked, would contaminate Israel for centuries, Mr Mahoul said. He referred to reports that Israel had exported nuclear waste to Mauritania, in north-west Africa. He attacked the cloak of secrecy surrounding what he described as nuclear missile sites near Kfar Zechariah on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and near Yodfat in the Galilee. He also said Israel was producing \"biological warfare\" material at an institute in Nes Tsiona. Mr Mahoul, who was supported by a member of the liberal Meretz party, as well as by his Knesset faction, described the government's official policy of \"nuclear ambiguity\" as \"nothing but self-delusion\". He said: \"The entire world now knows that Israel has a huge stockpile of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, and that it serves as the cornerstone for the nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\" \"I hope that today's debate will symbolise the breaking of the wall of silence and the beginning of an intensive debate in the Knesset and among the public on this subject,\" Mr Mahoul said. Haim Ramon, the member of the Israeli cabinet in charge of the prime minister's office, said that he could not respond in detail to Mr Mahoul's allegations. \"To do so would aid the enemy,\" he said. But he accused Mr Mahoul of hurting Israel's interests. \"Do you want us to tell Iran and Iraq exactly what we have and what we don't have? It's unheard of,\" he said. At the start of the debate, about two dozen rightwing Knesset members walked out in protest, according to the Associated Press news agency, which added that five Arab members were expelled for heckling. Though Shimon Peres, the father of Israel's nuclear programme has admitted that the Dimona reactor was built as a deterrent, Israel maintains an official policy of studied nuclear ambiguity, saying only that it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",

One thing we can say for certain is that the moment a serial killer is convicted, a familiar game is about to begin: cherchez la femme.</p> <p>Nor am I talking about the tragic list of female victims. In the case of Dr Harold Shipman, convicted on Monday of killing 15 women patients with lethal doses of diamorphine, the spotlight has shifted, swiftly and predictably, to his wife and mother. \"The mummy's boy addicted to murder\" was how the Daily Mail characterised Shipman, describing how, as an adolescent, he watched his beloved mother receive morphine injections as she died of cancer. \"Was it a child's rage that led him to kill women who enjoyed the longevity that she was denied?\" the paper demanded.</p> <p>Variants on this theory appealed to Oliver James, one of the media shrinks most frequently consulted by anxious journalists, and Dr Richard Badcock of Rampton special hospital. As for Shipman's wife Primrose, Dr Badcock told the Daily Telegraph that, because of Shipman's need for control, she might have had no life of her own. But the Mail was surprised by her strength of character, speculating that her husband's attitudes had rubbed off on her, giving her the strength to confront curious onlookers. It also asked, rhetorically: \"How can any wife stand by such a monster?\"</p> <p>Moves to strip Shipman of his pension, while they may provide some comfort to the relatives of his victims, will in effect punish his wife for his crimes. This is not an argument about whether or not Primrose Shipman is a pleasant person, but evidence of a disturbing phenomenon that surfaces when serial killers, especially men who murder women, are apprehended. Their closest female relatives are placed under intense and often hostile scrutiny, while their victims quickly become types, stripped of their individuality.</p> <p>In this case, we are told, Shipman was obsessed with elderly women. It may yet turn out, even allowing for journalistic hyperbole, that he killed more than 100 of them. Twelve of the 15 victims whose final minutes were described at his trial were over 60, three were 81. This common factor is assumed to hold the key to the killings and, with a little digging into his background, reporters quickly came up with Shipman's mother Vera, dead at the unusually early age of 43.</p> <p>But what if the obvious inference is wrong, as it has been in other cases? Serial killers face a number of practical problems, including access to victims and how to cover their tracks. What if Shipman selected his victims with a different thought in mind - that he did not want to be found out? It now transpires that the elevated death rate among his elderly patients had become noticeable enough to prompt an ineffectual police inquiry three months before his actual arrest. So what would people in Hyde have said if, instead of older women dying, his victims had been 25- and 30-year-olds?</p> <p>In a culture obsessed by youth, older women are far less visible, if not expendable. It was not the police but the daughter of Shipman's last victim, Kathleen Grundy, whose efforts finally brought the GP to justice. The first three victims in the court case died over a two-year period and their respective ages were 81, 67 and 77. If the women had been 41, 27 and 37, it would almost certainly have been a different story. This age group is more likely to visit a GP at his surgery and less inclined to share the traditional deference to doctors that apparently led Shipman's victims not to query his treatment.</p> <p>Not taking into account this vital factor, ease of access, has been disastrous in previous operations to track down serial killers. During the Yorkshire Ripper inquiry in the late 70s, West Yorkshire police convinced themselves they were looking for a man who hated prostitutes, a decision based on the fact that the middle group of victims worked in the sex industry. In fact, an analysis of the victims suggests Peter Sutcliffe turned to prostitutes, whom he could lure to a secluded place, after his assaults on women in residential neighbourhoods were disturbed. The police overlooked an early victim, a schoolgirl who provided an excellent photofit of Sutcliffe, and relied on forensic evidence from the murder of a prostitute in Preston which he did not commit.</p> <p>Even more dramatically, police in the US in the 1960s relied on an offender profile that suggested the Boston Strangler was a man with a pathological hatred of his mother, based on the fact that his initial victims were elderly. When a man called Albert DeSalvo confessed to the killings in prison, detectives at first refused to believe him because he had a warm relationship with his mother. He hated his violent father, DeSalvo explained, and his choice of elderly women was dictated by his assessment that they were physically weaker and would put up less of a fight. Later, as he grew more confident, he moved on to younger victims.</p> <p>I could ask a facetious question here: do serial killers have fathers? But there is a deeper problem. Pop psychology makes dramatic headlines, as it has already done in the Shipman case, but it also deflects discussion away from the real, gut-wrenching horror at the heart of these events. The most significant thing about the victims in the Harold Shipman case - as with Peter Sutcliffe, Albert DeSalvo, Ted Bundy, John Christie, Neville Heath and Jack the Ripper - is this. Their confirmed victims are all women.</p> <p>Forget the supposed obsessions with prostitutes, mothers or the elderly; what we have in each instance is a man who systematically set out to destroy women. Of course there are serial killers who target men or children, and their motives are often distorted by the press to create lurid headlines. But serial killing emerged as a crime committed by men against women and what we can say for certain about the motive of a Shipman or a Sutcliffe is that it is misogyny in its purest, most lethal form.</p> <p>If we lived in a society that valued, supported and nurtured women, whatever their age and appearance, this would seem bizarre. But we don't. Murder and violent pornography are at the far end of a scale, with sexual harassment and the demonisation of awkward women - single mothers, lesbians and so on - somewhere in the middle. In the circumstances, looking for an individual woman and a single event to explain Shipman's behaviour is perverse, a means of detaching him from the wider culture we all inhabit. And it is just possible that if we valued certain kinds of women more highly, in this case the elderly, men like Shipman might not get away with murder for quite so long.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The news that Helen Gurley Brown, creator of Cosmopolitan as we know it, was once a Kept Woman will hardly astound anyone for what it reveals about her morals - not anyone who has ever read American Cosmo, anyway. But it is intriguing nonetheless. HGB, she reveals in her autobiography, was 24 when she met her 43-year-old sugar daddy; she was applying for her 15th secretarial job and was told she'd got it after a session on a Moroccan leather couch in his office.</p> <p>After that they switched to a motel, while all she did in office hours was eat peanuts and read novels; it broke up after three months when he left for Europe with his wife. She then applied to an ad agency for her 16th job and was promoted to copy-writing, this being in the days when only by showing you were a lousy secretary were you allowed to do anything else. The rest is history.</p> <p>How did the sugar daddy pay her, I wonder? Leave the cheque on the mantelpiece in the Edwardian fashion? Give her $50 for the powder room, like Holly Golightly in Breakfast At Tiffany's? Or did he simply award her a ridiculously large salary? Putting your mistress on the payroll is fairly standard practice, after all, in some quarters: when it was revealed that a number of Democratic congressmen had done just that, Mrs Walter Mondale, asked how she felt about it, memorably said: \"The Democrats do it to their secretaries, the Republicans do it to the country.\"</p> <p>But being a mistress has its drawbacks. As a kept woman, you are disliked not only by the sugar daddies' short-changed wives but by working women generally. Workmates deeply resent any girl who is thought to be making her way to the top of the firm via the top of the desk, and successful, good-looking women are always furious at any suggestion that they have used their charm to get where they are. When the National Union of Journalists ran Fleet Street, there were stern rules about doing two years in the provinces before coming to London; these were designed to see that bed-worthy secretaries never got jobs above trained journalists. Or at any rate, that any girl journalist who was that way inclined would have to start by sleeping with provincial editors.</p> <p>I doubt if in journalism it is quite so crude - more often, I suspect, blokes kid themselves the desirable girls are really bright. But it seems still to be common enough in showbiz and in modelling - witness the recent scandals about oily agency men exploiting teenage hopefuls.</p> <p>But of course being kept didn't have to involve getting even a nominal job. Old-time mistresses arguably had a far better time of it; they were provided with a house, perhaps, a carriage, champagne. Many a hardworking girl, slogging home on the bus with a take-away and a packet of aspirins, might wistfully think how nice it would be to inhabit a cosily furnished love-nest, with a man to pay the bills and turn up with a bunch of flowers, and no real work to do before bedtime. (Time was, of course, when that was what wives expected, which was why the women's movement sometimes said marriage was just prostitution with better job security; but wives don't get far with such demands these days.) Just having to sleep with the boss on top of an already hard-working schedule seems, by comparison, not much of a deal.</p> <p>But the climate isn't right for a serious demimonde of pampered, witty, amusing mistresses, throwing parties \u00e0 la Traviata, holding salons of philosophers and poets like Aspasia in the Athens of Pericles. The degree to which you get a recognised class of mistress - well maintained by their protectors, supplied with red or white camellias according to the time of the month, all bills paid and a glittering social life - relates to the extent to which legal wives are corseted in respectability and made to stay at home being virtuous and dull. You don't get a mistress class as such when the girls men marry are the same as the ones they sleep with. An old-fashioned friend of bon vivant Cyril Ray once asked him where young men go these days for, you know, harrumph. Ray said he thought they mostly made private arrangements, to which the old boy said: \"What! Fellas sleeping with other fellas' sisters?\"</p> <p>Mistresses exist and always will. But few nowadays will ever aspire to the sort of lavish treatment that Edward VII afforded Lillie Langtry. \"I've spent enough money on you to buy a battleship!\" he once grumbled. \"And you've spent enough in me to float one,\" she demurely replied. I doubt if even the entire staff of Cosmo could match that.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The news that Helen Gurley Brown, creator of Cosmopolitan as we know it, was once a Kept Woman will hardly astound anyone for what it reveals about her morals - not anyone who has ever read American Cosmo, anyway. But it is intriguing nonetheless. HGB, she reveals in her autobiography, was 24 when she met her 43-year-old sugar daddy; she was applying for her 15th secretarial job and was told she'd got it after a session on a Moroccan leather couch in his office. After that they switched to a motel, while all she did in office hours was eat peanuts and read novels; it broke up after three months when he left for Europe with his wife. She then applied to an ad agency for her 16th job and was promoted to copy-writing, this being in the days when only by showing you were a lousy secretary were you allowed to do anything else. The rest is history. How did the sugar daddy pay her, I wonder? Leave the cheque on the mantelpiece in the Edwardian fashion? Give her $50 for the powder room, like Holly Golightly in Breakfast At Tiffany's? Or did he simply award her a ridiculously large salary? Putting your mistress on the payroll is fairly standard practice, after all, in some quarters: when it was revealed that a number of Democratic congressmen had done just that, Mrs Walter Mondale, asked how she felt about it, memorably said: \"The Democrats do it to their secretaries, the Republicans do it to the country.\" But being a mistress has its drawbacks. As a kept woman, you are disliked not only by the sugar daddies' short-changed wives but by working women generally. Workmates deeply resent any girl who is thought to be making her way to the top of the firm via the top of the desk, and successful, good-looking women are always furious at any suggestion that they have used their charm to get where they are. When the National Union of Journalists ran Fleet Street, there were stern rules about doing two years in the provinces before coming to London; these were designed to see that bed-worthy secretaries never got jobs above trained journalists. Or at any rate, that any girl journalist who was that way inclined would have to start by sleeping with provincial editors. I doubt if in journalism it is quite so crude - more often, I suspect, blokes kid themselves the desirable girls are really bright. But it seems still to be common enough in showbiz and in modelling - witness the recent scandals about oily agency men exploiting teenage hopefuls. But of course being kept didn't have to involve getting even a nominal job. Old-time mistresses arguably had a far better time of it; they were provided with a house, perhaps, a carriage, champagne. Many a hardworking girl, slogging home on the bus with a take-away and a packet of aspirins, might wistfully think how nice it would be to inhabit a cosily furnished love-nest, with a man to pay the bills and turn up with a bunch of flowers, and no real work to do before bedtime. (Time was, of course, when that was what wives expected, which was why the women's movement sometimes said marriage was just prostitution with better job security; but wives don't get far with such demands these days.) Just having to sleep with the boss on top of an already hard-working schedule seems, by comparison, not much of a deal. But the climate isn't right for a serious demimonde of pampered, witty, amusing mistresses, throwing parties \u00e0 la Traviata, holding salons of philosophers and poets like Aspasia in the Athens of Pericles. The degree to which you get a recognised class of mistress - well maintained by their protectors, supplied with red or white camellias according to the time of the month, all bills paid and a glittering social life - relates to the extent to which legal wives are corseted in respectability and made to stay at home being virtuous and dull. You don't get a mistress class as such when the girls men marry are the same as the ones they sleep with. An old-fashioned friend of bon vivant Cyril Ray once asked him where young men go these days for, you know, harrumph. Ray said he thought they mostly made private arrangements, to which the old boy said: \"What! Fellas sleeping with other fellas' sisters?\" Mistresses exist and always will. But few nowadays will ever aspire to the sort of lavish treatment that Edward VII afforded Lillie Langtry. \"I've spent enough money on you to buy a battleship!\" he once grumbled. \"And you've spent enough in me to float one,\" she demurely replied. I doubt if even the entire staff of Cosmo could match that.",

      "bodyText": "A European consortium plans to exploit Britain's status as the windiest country in Europe by installing two powerful wind turbines off the Northumberland coast this year. The consortium, Blyth Offshore Wind Ltd, said yesterday they would be the largest offshore turbines in the world when they start generating electricity in August. The combined four megawatt capacity would provide power for 3,000 homes. The project, Britain's first to harness the force of North Sea gales, was unveiled a day after the government set electricity suppliers a target of generating 10% of power from renewable sources by 2010 as part of its campaign to reduce greenhouse gases. The two turbines will be built by a Danish wind energy company, Vestas, half a mile off Blyth in sea 25 feet deep, close to an existing wind farm at Blyth harbour; the consortium hoped they would be the forerunners of much bigger projects in deeper waters further offshore. The consortium - Border Wind, PowerGen Renewables, Nuon UK, a unit of a Dutch firm, and Shell Renewables, part of the huge oil group - said that in theory Britain had sufficient wind to generate three times as much electricity as it consumed. The \u00a34m project, funded partly by the European com mission, is dwarfed by a \u00a36bn potential for offshore farms identified by the department of trade and industry. It is also tiny by comparison with plans to instal 750 megawatts of renewable energy in Denmark by the end of 2004, and an Irish project to build 200 megawatts of wind power six miles offshore in Dublin bay. David Still, managing director of Border Wind, said the UK lagged behind other European countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands in renewable energy but now had the chance to catch up. Offshore wind power, electricity from onshore wind farms, and bio-mass (burning organic waste) are seen as the three elements that can help industry reach the 10% target set by Helen Liddell, the energy minister, on Tuesday. Mr Still said that the Blyth project could lead to far bigger schemes, costing as much as \u00a3200m, that would be more efficient and thus bring down the cost of wind electricity. Mrs Liddell said this week she was \"not ready to see consumers pay through the nose\" for achieving the 10% target. The utilities bill foresees electricity customers receiving a 10% cut in bills so, Mrs Liddell said, they could be asked by suppliers to pay an extra \u00a31.35 on the average quarterly bill to fund green power.

      "bodyText": "Convalescent homes are to re-emerge under government plans for a new \"intermediate\" tier of care to enable elderly patients to be moved out of costly hospital beds but looked after until they are ready to go home. The plans were yesterday outlined by Alan Milburn, the health secretary, who promised to \"build a bridge between home and hospital\" in ways that would free acute care beds for more patients needing treatment. As well as a new generation of convalescent homes, ministers expect to oversee the opening of low-dependency wards in hospitals, run by consultant nurses, and the provision of more intensive domiciliary care to allow some elderly patients to go home sooner than is now possible. Mr Milburn said: \"This new set of intermediate care services needs to be specifically designed around the needs of older patients for a period of rehabilitation and their recovery.\" When in opposition, Labour mooted the idea of investing heavily in rehabilitation services to take pressure off hospitals. The initiative has been spurred by the findings of the department of health inquiry into bed use and availability. Two-thirds of hospital beds are occupied by patients older than 65, and half the rapid increase in emergency admissions in the past five years has been accounted for by people over 75 - one in two of whom has been admitted on grounds of \"symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions\". In an address at the King's Fund health policy centre in London, Mr Milburn said the ageing population and rising incidence of chronic disease meant that the nature of NHS care was changing from dealing with life's incidents, such as heart attacks and bone fractures, to dealing with life's experiences: getting older and becoming frailer. The beds inquiry report, to be published this month, would show no simple link between the number of acute beds in a hospital, the management of emergencies and waiting times for non-urgent surgery. While it was evident that more critical care beds were needed for the gravely ill, and that there would have to be an overall increase in bed numbers in the whole system, the inquiry report would urge wholesale modernisation of the care process. Too many elderly people faced a false choice between hospital and home, the minister said. \"The beds inquiry will show that they are effectively trapped when they should be free to get back on their own feet after a period of hospitalisation,\" he said The plans to bring back convalescent beds, which used to be commonplace but went out of fashion in the 1960s, envisage both a new role for some existing cottage hospitals and the building of some new units, probably with private finance. Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, welcomed the initiative but asked why existing nursing homes could not be used. The same point was made by the Independent Healthcare Association, which said specialist rehabilitation services stood ready and waiting in the private and voluntary sectors. Mr Milburn said nursing homes were associated with dependency and were places people tended to go into, never to come out. \"That might be right for a lot of elderly people, but it's not right for all elderly people,\" he said. \"What I want to foster is not a dependency culture, it's an independency culture.\" Julia Neuberger, chief executive of the King's Fund, said: \"It is essential that the facilities announced today are staffed by people who are skilled in supporting older people and that their primary purpose is to help patients to regain their independence.\"",

Hale is one of a string of postcodes across Manchester's southern commuter belt that has been identified by a credit reference agency, Experian, as the wealthiest area of Britain outside the south-east of England. More than one in 20 householders is a millionaire in the 11-mile strip of affluence running from Altrincham through Hale, Wilmslow, Alderley Edge and Prestbury. The district has long been known as the home of many of Manchester's football and soap stars. Roy Keene has a large detached Victorian house in Hale, Teddy Sherringham is living down the road in Bowdon close to Mr and Mrs Beckham, and Robbie Williams has a home in Alderley Edge. Now a new wave of arriviste businessmen and women is buying up properties. Desirable residencies, say the estate agents, are 30 minutes from the heart of Manchester, 10 minutes from the airport, and in the catchment area of some of the north-west's highest achieving schools. Shopkeepers in the high street at Hale, surrounded by vast detached laurel-hedged residences, have noticed a marked increase in trade. Jonathan Kennedy, of Reed Rains estate agents, said yesterday that he had had an incredibly good year and had sold several properties at prices well over \u00a32m. \"You can get almost any property you like in this area.

Stephen McClean and Noel McCready smirked and sniggered in the dock of Belfast crown court as they were found guilty of what the judge described as one of Northern Ireland's \"most heinous offences\". A third man, Ryan Robley, who had already pleaded guilty to the killings, was also jailed for life. The victims' mothers expressed outrage outside the court when it became clear that the killers, believed to be members of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, could be free by the summer under the terms of the Good Friday agreement. Philip Allen, a 34-year-old Protestant, and Damian Trainor, 25, a Catholic, who had known each other since childhood, died when Mc Clean and McCready opened fire indiscriminately in the Railway Bar, Poyntzpass, a Co Armagh village, in March 1998. As they burst into the bar, one of the gunmen shouted: \"Get down, you bastards.\" Mr Allen, a lorry driver who had announced his engagement shortly before the shootings, and Mr Trainor, a mechanic who was due to be his best man, died in hospital shortly after. Two other men were injured in the attack. The killings united nationalists and unionists who were horrified by the murder of two peaceful friends, from either side of Northern Ireland's sectarian divide, as they enjoyed a drink. Their deaths helped to spur Northern Ireland's political leaders to sign the Good Friday agreement a month after the shootings. Mr Justice Kerr condemned the \"mindless bigotry\" of the killers who had selected the bar in the mistaken belief that it was frequented only by Catholics. In his 70-page judgment, the judge said that the masked intruders, who were both carrying hand guns, had ordered all the customers to lie down. \"When the gunmen had the occupants in a position of complete vulnerability, they opened fire,\" he said. \"It is clear they intended to kill as many people as possible, irrespective of the age or gender.\" The judge added that the two victims typified the spirit of Poyntzpass where Catholics and Protestants lived in harmony. \"That they could have been victims of this cowardly attack is made all the more poignant by the fact that the killers who perpetuated it were motivated by mindless bigotry,\" he said.

Ethel Allen was also opposed to the early release of the killers. But she said: \"At least they will be labelled guilty for the rest of their lives for the murder of my loving son.\" In separate interviews for last night's Belfast Telegraph, the two mothers spoke movingly of how they have struggled to cope with the loss of their sons. Mrs Allen said that for the first year after her son's death she tried to convince herself that he was still alive. \"By day I told myself that he was at work and at night I told myself he was with [his fianc\u00e9e] Carol or Damian,\" she said. McClean, 30, and McCready, 33, from Banbridge, Co Down, were also each given two 20-year sentences for the attempted murders of Stephen Williamson and Clarence Fraser, who were wounded in the shooting. The judge also imposed a 15-year term on the pair for possession of a firearm. All sentences are to run concurrently. The guilty plea by Robley, 30, also from Banbridge, was taken into account and he was given 14 years for the attempted murders and 10 for the firearms charge. A fourth man, David Keyes, 23, was also charged with the murders after showing police the two guns used in the attack.

The out-of-court settlement was agreed yesterday as a district judge at central London county court criticised the \"extraordinary state of affairs\" which led to the arrest and five-hour detention of the theatre group, which included a boy aged 12. The group was rehearsing Mountain Language, a play inspired by the plight of the Kurds which includes violent scenes of torture. The men, who all have home office status as refugees after fleeing torture and oppression in Turkey, brought a civil action against the police for assault, trespass and false imprisonment. In what the men's solicitor called \"a horror story of life imitating art\", dozens of armed police smashed down the doors of the Kurdistan Workers' Association community centre, in Finsbury Park, north London, on the evening of June 19 1996, after a member of the public reported seeing men in combat gear pointing guns at people on the floor. The group was arrested at gunpoint, handcuffed and held in the back of a police van for more than five hours without explanation. The actors were forbidden to speak in their native language - in scenes similar to the play they had been rehearsing. Ahmet Yuksel, then 12, was held elsewhere, uncertain of his friends' whereabouts, while police searched the building and discovered that the weapons were props on loan from the Royal National Theatre - a fact made known to local police weeks earlier. The Metroplitan police, which has not admitted liability, will also pay the legal costs, expected to exceed \u00a345,000. A case brought by a 12th man is still in progress. Scotland Yard declined to comment yesterday but a spokesman said at the time of the arrests that officers had acted \"in good faith\". The New Life Theatre Group had been due to perform Mountain Language in front of Pinter, who wrote the play after witnessing Kurdish persecution in Turkey. The title is a reference to the Turkish-imposed ban on the Kurdish language, which is derided as the \"mountain language\".

A damning report by the Scottish parliament's culture committee yesterday criticised Scottish Opera's former management for its \"arrogant\" attitude to the crisis, which brought the company to the brink of collapse, with debts of around \u00a32.5m. The cross-party report singles out one of the government's key advisers on the arts for particular censure. It says Ruth MacKenzie - then general director of Scottish Opera and now a special adviser to the culture secretary, Chris Smith - failed to meet standards required. Ms MacKenzie and Scottish Opera's former chairman, Sandy Orr, are accused of neither understanding nor accepting responsibility for the crisis. In a hugely personal attack, the report accuses Ms MacKenzie and Mr Orr of gauchely running the company on the assumption that the taxpayer would bail them out of financial difficulties. Mary Mulligan, a Labour MSP and the culture committee's convener, said: \"Scottish Opera were a disaster in terms of their financial management and the way they responded to a bad situation.\" The full extent of the financial crisis only became apparent last year when the company's interim chief executive, Adrian Tricke. went to the Scottish executive with books showing a \u00a32.5m deficit for Scottish Ballet and Scottish Opera. The Scottish education minister Sam Galbraith made a one-off payment of \u00a32.1m to save the national company from closure, using money that he later admitted had been set aside to reduce class sizes. The government has been forced to bail out Scottish Opera 11 times in the past three decades. Scottish Opera has now merged with Scottish Ballet and is run by a joint board. Daniel McGhie, chairman of the new board, said lessons would be learned from the committee's report, but he had no plans to cut back on productions. The report criticises Ms MacKenzie's handling of the finances of a one-off Edinburgh Festival production of Macbeth, which cost \u00a3750,000 when the company was already seriously in debt. \"We believe that there was an attitude within Scottish Opera which simply said budgets don't matter,\" said Mike Russell, the Scottish National Party spokesman on culture. In her accounting of Macbeth, Ms MacKenzie used a procedure she has insisted is proper, which shifted the cost from one financial year to the other. The criticism of Ms MacKenzie comes as an embarrassment to the government, which sought her out for a senior advisory position in the culture department. Ms MacKenzie was unavailable for comment yesterday, but Mr Orr said the committee had failed to understand how arts were funded in Britain. \"There is no substance to any of the extraordinary accusations made against us,\" he said. The Scottish Arts Council is criticised for failing to properly supervise budgets and for allowing a culture that presumed government bailouts would be forthcoming.

Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, is expected to outline the move in a Commons statement amid signs that a frantic round of diplomacy involving Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, his Irish counterpart, has failed to produce a breakthrough. The two prime ministers are expected to mount a final effort to rescue the process this morning when they hold emergency talks during Mr Blair's trip to Devon. Mr Ahern, the taoiseach, is due to report on his talks with the republican movement in Dublin last night where he issued an appeal to Martin Ferris, a member of the IRA army council, to save the process by making a gesture on arms. The appeal appeared to have been unsuccessful when the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, said after the talks last night that the Unionist demands for immediate decommissioning were \"disastrous\". Mr Blair also struck a pessimistic note in the Commons yesterday when he admitted the IRA had still not agreed to disarm, throwing the peace process into a \"serious crisis\" that could place lives at risk. \"Let us never forget that there are people now today that, if we don't get this peace process sorted out and moving forward again, will not grow up either in normal conditions and some will not be alive at all,\" Mr Blair told MPs. The prime minister is expected to make a final decision on restoring direct rule after his meeting with Mr Ahern this morning. Pulling the plug on Northern Ireland's first power-sharing executive in 26 years would be a drastic step that would deeply anger Sinn Fein. Mr Adams has warned that such a move would provoke the IRA into withdrawing from General John de Chastelain's decommissioning body, ending any prospect of disarmament.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is considering changing the law to allow political parties to use all-women shortlists to select parliamentary candidates amid Labour concerns that it could lose its newly-increased share of women's votes. In a meeting with Labour's national executive, Mr Blair acknowledged that his party, which has 101 women MPs, had to act to ensure it did not slip back. After admitting for the first time that he had been a \"complete doubter\" over the all-female shortlists Labour tried to introduced at the last election, Mr Blair acknowledged: \"I do think that the results of that were in fact very important for us at that election.\" Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, is pressing him to introduce legislation after the next election to permit all-women shortlists. Labour's last attempt to use the strategy - introduced under John Smith following pressure from women MPs - was stymied after the all-female lists were ruled illegal. The party chose not to appeal against the judgment, though many legal advisers felt it was open to challenge. Ms McDonagh is convinced that action is needed if the party is to apprach is goal of a 50:50 balance of men and women MPs. However, since there will be no chance of such a legal change before the next election - probably less than 18 months away - the party is having to rely on encouragement and coercion to ensure a respectable number of women candidates in the selection process. This week, Labour constituency secretaries received a letter from Ms McDonagh reminding them that \"the party is committed to increasing the number of women MPs\". Women MPs have been pressing the party high command to recognise that Labour risks jeopardising support from women voters if it is not seen to promote policies directed at women and to prove that the influx of women MPs in the last election was more than a one-off gimmick.",

As Mr Norman made clear that he would not sell his 10% shareholding in Knutsford, a money-spinning takeover vehicle, Labour and the Liberal Democrats stepped up attacks, claiming that the former supermarket whizzkid's extensive business interests would clash directly with his new brief covering environment, transport and the regions. The multi-millionaire businessman, who was appointed to the shadow cabinet on Tuesday in a surprise Conservative reshuffle, also faced mockery from opponents when it emerged that he would not lead a Tory-instigated Commons debate last night on greenfield development - an issue at the core of his environmental portfolio. John Prescott, the environment secretary and deputy prime minister, ridiculed William Hague, saying the appointment of Mr Norman was the worst example of the Tory leader's \"appalling judgment\". He claimed Mr Norman would be \"strangled by conflicts of interest at every turn\". Meanwhile, John Redwood, ousted as environment spokesman to make way for Mr Norman, made clear his \"great shock\" at his sacking in a handwritten letter to Mr Hague. Allies of Mr Redwood insisted that he intended to remain loyal, but there were expressions of sympathy from both wings of his party and outrage within his Wokingham constituency party. There were rumours, too, that Mr Norman had secured his promotion after warning Mr Hague that he would otherwise quit and return to business. After pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats after his appointment, Mr Norman yesterday announced he would step down immediately as a non-executive director of Railtrack, a post he had held since 1994. He will also sell his shares in the company. However, though Asda yesterday said the MP was no longer on its payroll as a paid consultant, Conservative central office later said both sides were still \"in talks\" over Mr Norman's contract to act as a paid consultant until June this year. He is expected to leave the post. Mr Norman, who recently resigned as Asda chairman after turning round the ailing supermarket chain, also remains a director of and share holder in Knutsford, the shell company he helped set up to take over other businesses. Shares in the company plummeted yesterday amid City fears that he would have less time for searching out investment targets. Mr Norman is one of four partners - known as the \"awesome foursome\" - in Knutsford, which was linked with a possible takeover bid for Marks &amp; Spencer. Central office said last night that he had no plans to step down from Knutsford or from the chairmanship of French plc, a small textile firm. He would reconsider if a conflict of interest arose, central office added. The party also pointed out that the Labour ministers Lord Simon and Stephen Timms took three and eight months respectively to put their shares in blind trusts. Don Foster, the Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman, led calls on Mr Norman to place all his shares, including those in Knutsford, in a blind trust, to be \"more rigorously\" managed than trusts used by Labour ministers, which have been frequently condemned by the Tories. Mr Foster also raised concerns about Mr Norman's role, when Asda chairman, in overseeing the merger with the American supermarket company Wal-Mart, which he said had been responsible for \"the death of many small businesses\". \"Asda/Wal-Mart can only prosper if they get a series of major planning consents which conflict with generally agreed planning policy.\"",

      "body": "<p>One thing about being a pundit, no one ever calls you that on air. Notice how Lynda Lee Potter is referred to as \"the writer and journalist\" when she appears on Any Questions to disseminate a world view which makes Jack Straw look a Hampstead liberal. Or how Tony Parsons is introduced as \"the novelist and writer\" as he prepares to deconstruct cultural offerings. Or the way in which David Starkey, a serial occupier of the punditry pulpit, is described as \"the historian\" - except when he is called upon to be rude about the royal family, when it is always \"the constitutional historian\". </p> <p>Yet we all know what punditry is: the game of providing slanted views for those anxious to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of even-handedness. Convention demands that radio or television presenters cannot have an opinion. But since opinions are what the public is deemed to want, producers trawl newspapers for someone less coy about letting the world know what they think. On any subject - from Tony Blair's first 1,000 days to David Beckham's underwear - there will be someone whose opinion will be sought. And occasionally it isn't Boris Johnson. </p> <p>It is, therefore, a calling that deserves to be recognised by its own title: sing it out, sing it loud, we are pundits and we are proud. Besides, the sheer number of media outlets means that the punditry market is growing so vast, soon there won't be time to be anything other than a pundit. Every day, for instance, the licence fees of several score pensioners are absorbed ferrying pundits in to fill the blank acreage of the BBC News 24 schedule. At any moment, the foyer at Television Centre is awash with the opinionated waiting for BBC taxis to transport them on to their next appointment at Sky News, GMTV, or the Ann Diamond Show at LBC. </p> <p>Crack it and there is a whole career out there: news bulletins, documentaries, and for the lucky few the very apex of punditry: laughing at Paul Merton's jokes on Have I Got News For You.

      "bodyText": "One thing about being a pundit, no one ever calls you that on air. Notice how Lynda Lee Potter is referred to as \"the writer and journalist\" when she appears on Any Questions to disseminate a world view which makes Jack Straw look a Hampstead liberal. Or how Tony Parsons is introduced as \"the novelist and writer\" as he prepares to deconstruct cultural offerings. Or the way in which David Starkey, a serial occupier of the punditry pulpit, is described as \"the historian\" - except when he is called upon to be rude about the royal family, when it is always \"the constitutional historian\". Yet we all know what punditry is: the game of providing slanted views for those anxious to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of even-handedness. Convention demands that radio or television presenters cannot have an opinion. But since opinions are what the public is deemed to want, producers trawl newspapers for someone less coy about letting the world know what they think. On any subject - from Tony Blair's first 1,000 days to David Beckham's underwear - there will be someone whose opinion will be sought. And occasionally it isn't Boris Johnson. It is, therefore, a calling that deserves to be recognised by its own title: sing it out, sing it loud, we are pundits and we are proud. Besides, the sheer number of media outlets means that the punditry market is growing so vast, soon there won't be time to be anything other than a pundit. Every day, for instance, the licence fees of several score pensioners are absorbed ferrying pundits in to fill the blank acreage of the BBC News 24 schedule. At any moment, the foyer at Television Centre is awash with the opinionated waiting for BBC taxis to transport them on to their next appointment at Sky News, GMTV, or the Ann Diamond Show at LBC. Crack it and there is a whole career out there: news bulletins, documentaries, and for the lucky few the very apex of punditry: laughing at Paul Merton's jokes on Have I Got News For You. So, how do you become a pundit? How do you leap aboard a train so awash with gravy it makes the EU express to Strasbourg look ascetic? In sport it helps if you once played the game - Alan Hansen and Ian Botham have both proven that an ability to hack a ball into row Z does not necessarily preclude you from stringing two or three coherent sentences together.

      "body": "<p>We are in Baghdad in 1991, and something strange is happening. A hush falls over the city as a huge shimmering face materialises in the sky. Soldiers and citizens prostrate themselves as each hears the voice of Allah coming from within, commanding them to overthrow the evil and treacherous Saddam Hussein. Within minutes an angry mob is storming the palace as the guards flee... </p> <p>This highly imaginative scenario was proposed by US Air Force planners for a bloodless victory in the Gulf conflict. The idea of putting words in God's mouth is not new. Back in the second century AD Lucian described a statue of the god Aesculapius which spoke to believers, aided by a hidden priest with a speaking tube. </p> <p>The Baghdad plan involved projecting a giant hologram over Iraq. This kind of projection requires a mirror behind it, and the scale of the project dictated a mirror several miles across up in space. Orbital mirrors have to be extremely lightweight, so the construction is based around a very a thin sheet of metallised plastic. It is folded for launch; once in orbit it unfurls itself like a giant umbrella. So far the largest mirror has been 30 metres wide, but the present versions are too small to produce a convincing image at ground level. </p> <p>Another approach would be to make a mirror out of thin air. When warm air lies on top of cold air, the difference in density is enough to bend light. This causes the familiar illusory puddles in the road on a hot day. At higher altitudes, a mirage can make whole landscapes appear in the sky, an effect known as fata morgana. An artificial mirage could in theory be made by heating the atmosphere with radio waves or microwaves. </p> <p>The military certainly appears to believe in the potential use of holograms. A USAF think-tank has devised uses ranging from deceptive holographic imaging to the Star Trek sounding distortion field projector. These are described as useful for strategic deception purposes, particularly against an unsophisticated adversary. They would be projected by a special aircraft, the airborne hologram projector. Perhaps the nearest current equivalent is the Commando Solo, a modified Hercules festooned with aerials and antennae and carrying pods of classified electronics. Flown by the 193rd Special Operations Detachment (\"We fire electrons, not bullets\"), it has been involved in the Gulf and the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts. Commando Solos equipment can transmit across the electromagnetic spectrum including radio and television signals. Its other capabilities include jamming, deception and manipulation techniques. </p> <p> T he face of God is not enough on its own. A voice is needed. A new technique using microwaves could produce this. When a high power microwave pulse strikes the human body, a small temperature perturbation occurs. This causes an expansion of tissue which can create an acoustic wave. A report from the USAF scientific advisory board says: \"With a pulse stream, an internal acoustic field of 5-15KHz can be created which is audible. Thus it may be possible to 'talk' to adversaries in a way which would be most disturbing to them.\" </p> <p>The practical difficulties involved in microwave transmission are formidable. The exact sound perceived depends on the size and shape of the skull of the hearer and their orientation to the source. Microwaves can be reflected or damped by solid objects, so there is a risk that God's voice will have the underwater quality of poor radio reception. And would you believe in a God whose voice drops off when you walk behind a lamp-post? </p> <p>Although the plan had major technical hurdles to overcome, the main reasons for rejecting it were cultural. Images of Allah are forbidden in Islam. How can you project an image of God when nobody knows what He is supposed to look like? </p> <p>There is also a fundamental problem with psychology. The plan has Boys' Own Paper view of foreigners as being conveniently superstitious savages, prone to fleeing at the sound of a disembodied voice from a gramophone. This may have been the case in some places a century ago, but the citizens of Baghdad are by no means backward. They have satellite dishes and VCRs like the rest of the world. </p> <p>People have been exposed to years of sophisticated computer-generated imagery and flashy special effects. If the image of God did appear in the heavens, someone would be bound to look up at the wavering image and suggest that it was all done with mirrors.</p>",

Back in the second century AD Lucian described a statue of the god Aesculapius which spoke to believers, aided by a hidden priest with a speaking tube. The Baghdad plan involved projecting a giant hologram over Iraq. This kind of projection requires a mirror behind it, and the scale of the project dictated a mirror several miles across up in space. Orbital mirrors have to be extremely lightweight, so the construction is based around a very a thin sheet of metallised plastic. It is folded for launch; once in orbit it unfurls itself like a giant umbrella. So far the largest mirror has been 30 metres wide, but the present versions are too small to produce a convincing image at ground level. Another approach would be to make a mirror out of thin air. When warm air lies on top of cold air, the difference in density is enough to bend light. This causes the familiar illusory puddles in the road on a hot day. At higher altitudes, a mirage can make whole landscapes appear in the sky, an effect known as fata morgana. An artificial mirage could in theory be made by heating the atmosphere with radio waves or microwaves. The military certainly appears to believe in the potential use of holograms. A USAF think-tank has devised uses ranging from deceptive holographic imaging to the Star Trek sounding distortion field projector. These are described as useful for strategic deception purposes, particularly against an unsophisticated adversary. They would be projected by a special aircraft, the airborne hologram projector. Perhaps the nearest current equivalent is the Commando Solo, a modified Hercules festooned with aerials and antennae and carrying pods of classified electronics. Flown by the 193rd Special Operations Detachment (\"We fire electrons, not bullets\"), it has been involved in the Gulf and the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts. Commando Solos equipment can transmit across the electromagnetic spectrum including radio and television signals. Its other capabilities include jamming, deception and manipulation techniques. T he face of God is not enough on its own. A voice is needed. A new technique using microwaves could produce this. When a high power microwave pulse strikes the human body, a small temperature perturbation occurs. This causes an expansion of tissue which can create an acoustic wave. A report from the USAF scientific advisory board says: \"With a pulse stream, an internal acoustic field of 5-15KHz can be created which is audible. Thus it may be possible to 'talk' to adversaries in a way which would be most disturbing to them.\" The practical difficulties involved in microwave transmission are formidable. The exact sound perceived depends on the size and shape of the skull of the hearer and their orientation to the source. Microwaves can be reflected or damped by solid objects, so there is a risk that God's voice will have the underwater quality of poor radio reception. And would you believe in a God whose voice drops off when you walk behind a lamp-post? Although the plan had major technical hurdles to overcome, the main reasons for rejecting it were cultural. Images of Allah are forbidden in Islam. How can you project an image of God when nobody knows what He is supposed to look like? There is also a fundamental problem with psychology. The plan has Boys' Own Paper view of foreigners as being conveniently superstitious savages, prone to fleeing at the sound of a disembodied voice from a gramophone. This may have been the case in some places a century ago, but the citizens of Baghdad are by no means backward. They have satellite dishes and VCRs like the rest of the world. People have been exposed to years of sophisticated computer-generated imagery and flashy special effects. If the image of God did appear in the heavens, someone would be bound to look up at the wavering image and suggest that it was all done with mirrors.",

Many of our geological sites are of international importance. </p> <p>All over the world, rock strata that record the history of the Earth between 545 and 354 million years ago are referred to periods of geological time which were first recognised and named in Britain. The Cambrian Period (from 545 to 495 million years ago) is from the Latin name for Wales and was founded on the strata and fossils of North Wales. They were named by Adam Sedgwick, a Cambridge professor, friend of Wordsworth and Darwin's tutor in geology. The Devonian Period (417 to 354 million years ago) was also named by Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, a young gentleman geologist and ex-military man who had fought at Corunna in the Peninsular wars. The rocks of our SSSIs have also provided some of the oldest known fossil fish (Orkney), reptiles (Edinburgh), dinosaurs (Sussex), mammals (Bristol) and land plants (Herefordshire). </p> <p>Much of our understanding of the effects of global warming, is derived from the ice age events of the past two and a half million years. Their history is recorded in the landforms of upland Britain and glacially derived sediments of the lowlands (such as the Scilly Isles). </p> <p>Britain played a seminal role in the 19th-century development of geology. Reminiscent of the great Victorian blue books, the Geological Conservation Review (GCR) series will comprise 42 volumes. Sixteen have been published, three are in press and the remaining 23 have been commissioned. </p> <p>The most recent, British Tertiary Stratigraphy, details the network of 58 SSSIs that record life and environments between 65 and 2.6 million years old. During this time, the North Atlantic Ocean was opening up as North America moved away from Europe. Huge volcanoes in the west of Scotland poured out lavas, many hundreds of metres thick, over the landscape. Global climates were at least 10 degrees warmer than now (the London area gently simmered with mean annual temperatures of between 20C and 25C) and sea levels were significantly higher. </p> <p>Shallow seas flooding over the south of England were crammed with fish, sharks, rays, crocodiles, turtles, snakes, corals and clams. The coastline was fringed with mangroves, reed swamps and palms. Inland there was lush semitropical rainforest full of newly evolved mammals and birds. This rich tapestry has been reconstructed over the past 200 years by amateur and professional geologists from sites such as today's uninspiring foreshore muds of Herne Bay and the Isle of Sheppey in the Thames estuary. </p> <p>The geological richness of these sites gives them an international importance and SSSI status. And, several of our most important offshore oil and gas fields (e.g. Frigg, Forties, Montrose) are hosted in Tertiary age sediments. Over the past 12 years, the Frigg Field has produced more than 20 million cubic metres of gas and the Montrose Field over 90 million tonnes of oil. Rocks still have economic clout. </p> <p>\u0095 Information about GCR publications from the GCR Unit, JNCC, Monkstone House, Peterborough PE1 1JY.

The Cambrian Period (from 545 to 495 million years ago) is from the Latin name for Wales and was founded on the strata and fossils of North Wales. They were named by Adam Sedgwick, a Cambridge professor, friend of Wordsworth and Darwin's tutor in geology. The Devonian Period (417 to 354 million years ago) was also named by Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, a young gentleman geologist and ex-military man who had fought at Corunna in the Peninsular wars. The rocks of our SSSIs have also provided some of the oldest known fossil fish (Orkney), reptiles (Edinburgh), dinosaurs (Sussex), mammals (Bristol) and land plants (Herefordshire). Much of our understanding of the effects of global warming, is derived from the ice age events of the past two and a half million years. Their history is recorded in the landforms of upland Britain and glacially derived sediments of the lowlands (such as the Scilly Isles). Britain played a seminal role in the 19th-century development of geology. Reminiscent of the great Victorian blue books, the Geological Conservation Review (GCR) series will comprise 42 volumes. Sixteen have been published, three are in press and the remaining 23 have been commissioned. The most recent, British Tertiary Stratigraphy, details the network of 58 SSSIs that record life and environments between 65 and 2.6 million years old. During this time, the North Atlantic Ocean was opening up as North America moved away from Europe. Huge volcanoes in the west of Scotland poured out lavas, many hundreds of metres thick, over the landscape. Global climates were at least 10 degrees warmer than now (the London area gently simmered with mean annual temperatures of between 20C and 25C) and sea levels were significantly higher. Shallow seas flooding over the south of England were crammed with fish, sharks, rays, crocodiles, turtles, snakes, corals and clams. The coastline was fringed with mangroves, reed swamps and palms. Inland there was lush semitropical rainforest full of newly evolved mammals and birds. This rich tapestry has been reconstructed over the past 200 years by amateur and professional geologists from sites such as today's uninspiring foreshore muds of Herne Bay and the Isle of Sheppey in the Thames estuary. The geological richness of these sites gives them an international importance and SSSI status. And, several of our most important offshore oil and gas fields (e.g. Frigg, Forties, Montrose) are hosted in Tertiary age sediments. Over the past 12 years, the Frigg Field has produced more than 20 million cubic metres of gas and the Montrose Field over 90 million tonnes of oil. Rocks still have economic clout. \u0095 Information about GCR publications from the GCR Unit, JNCC, Monkstone House, Peterborough PE1 1JY.

His company \"provides web content for sites\". He suggests that it is alright to create pages even if the content \"is not the real content\" Twice in the last few days I have had demonstrations of web sites where the proud demonstrator disclaimed all responsibility for the content. Never mind the content, feel the graphics. He has obviously been too busy to read the recent Online article where Jacob Neilsen, the creator of Google.com, made a case for graphic-free sites where the visitor just might be able to find the information required. Alertbox.com and it's top ten mistakes in web design would give him pause for thought. At the nuts and bolts level, Dreamweaver is not free, cheap or easy to use. How do you do your maintenance after 30 days are up? Frames are not an unmitigated good, especially for someone who would like to pass on some of you information in an email say or print it out.

That means they will all be able to look at specially converted web pages and order goods from sites from, among others, the BBC and Virgin Megastore. </p> <p>Virgin is able to offer the service thanks to a unique SIM-card based browser, which means you don't have to buy a special WAP phone. </p> <p>Virgin claims this is \"silicon socialism at its finest\" because you won't have to buy an \"expensive top-of-the-range phone first\" - but that doesn't quite tell the whole story. You'll still spend a lot more on the handset at Virgin because its unsubsidised, line rental-free handsets are all more expensive than their rivals. That means a Nokia 3210 is \u00a329.99 plus contract at Cellnet, but \u00a3149.99 at Virgin. A Cellnet WAP phone costs \u00a3129.99, plus line rental, at Cellnet. The benefit with Virgin is that you do not have to pay line rental or standing charges, or sign a contract. </p> <p>Meanwhile, electronics giant Motorola is fighting back against market leader Nokia and resurgent Ericsson with a new set of mobile phones, previews of innovative devices and an alliance with handheld computer maker Psion. </p> <p>The most eye-catching gadget shown off to journalists in New York last week was the Timeport Wireless Communicator, a messaging device that is around the same size and weight as a pack of cards. </p> <p>Despite its small size, the Communicator can send and receive email and messages independently of a mobile phone, discreetly vibrating when a new email or news update arrives. The device, finished in grey, sports a tiny Querty keyboard and LCD screen which, although not up to the standards of Psion or Palm devices, is adequate for short emails. It also features productivity software like an address book and scheduler. </p> <p>When it goes on sale later in the year, the device will run on GPRS (General Packet Radio Services) - a new, much faster mobile standard due to arrive in the UK this summer. </p> <p>The only problem with the addictive little gadget might be the price. At around the \u00a3200 mark, it might have been a big stocking-filling hit. But we're reliably informed they'll cost quite a bit more than that - keeping them in suits rather than schoolbags. It's up against the new Siemens IC35, announced in Cannes on Tuesday. </p> <p>It looks rather like its Motorola rival, with a tiny keyboard and screen, and has similar functions. But it also carries two advantages: it'll be on sale sooner, in late spring, and it'll be cheaper, at around \u00a3150. The downside is that the IC35 is less elegant a solution than the Motorola, needing to be combined with a mobile phone with built-in data interface in order to do email. We wait to see if playgrounds fill with kids grappling with the intricacies of wireless networking. </p> <p>Also unveiled by Motorola were a series of WAP enabled mobile phones. They included the Timeport P7389e - an e-commerce phone into which you can insert a \"smart\" mircochip-carrying banking card, and buy services and goods from WAP sites. The banking card payment system - using e-cash or credit cards - offers an alternative to paying for your orders through your mobile phone bill. The mobile bill option is a simpler method than fiddling with plastic, but one which, understandably, credit card issuers were less keen on. The e-commerce phone will go on sale this summer. </p> <p>Motorola has also teamed up with handheld computer manufacturer Psion to make a new series of mobile devices. This is only the latest in a series of alliances forged between leading technology companies as the mobile internet battle heats up. </p> <p>In December, Microsoft and Ericsson formed a joint venture to develop a mobile internet browser for handheld devices. </p> <p> Meanwhile Nokia is working with Palm Computing to develop new wireless internet gadgets.

The C-3030 Zoom doesn't just do stills: it can also act as a video camera as well. It features a QuickTime video mode that enables users to capture up to 190 seconds of video at 160x120 resolution. An internal microphone gives users the option of adding audio to their shot or footage. </p> <p>The C-3030 is also the first Olympus digital camera to sport a USB interface and serial port connection.

However, it seems the \u00a39.99 cartridge will also work with Mario Golf and Rare's forthcoming Perfect Dark. The Transfer Pak plugs into the Rumble Pak slot in an N64 control pad, and is expected on March 31. Home golfers take on Tiger Tiger Woods expects to get thrashed during the PGA Tour by armchair golfers. Electronic Arts and the PGA are promising a \"revolution in golf [that] takes computer gaming to a whole new level\" with Play Against The Pros. In other words, users who log on to EA's web site with the forthcoming Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 golf game will be able to play while following the live game in one corner of the screen. Details are expected at www.playagainstthepros.com. Another gaming system that really will link game players with a live sport is being developed in Europe, but won't be announced until next week. The art of big business Electronic Arts has kept its position as the world's biggest independent producer of video games, thanks to the success of Fifa 2000 in Europe and Asia, and SimCity 300 and Madden NFL2000 in the US. In the important Christmas selling season, EA's sales climbed by 15% to $601m, while profits grew by 28% to $93m. Sales of Sony PlayStation games grew by 31%, while sales of Nintendo 64 games were flat. However, the company knows where it's heading now. It says: \"With the expected launch of PlayStation 2 in Japan in March and in the US and Europe in the fall, we continue to focus on developing multiple products for this platform, in order to achieve our top priority in 2000: becoming the leading third party publisher on PlayStation 2.\"",

It's so big, it's hard to appreciate how many things it's going to bring to the lives of our users....\" </p> <p>Kogan, a perky 27-year-old American, has spent nine years in New York, picking up an MBA in corporate identity and marketing and working in television and new media. At the Hill &amp; Knowlton consultancy she worked on high-profile launches, including Boo.com. At <a href=\"http://www.Orientation.com\" target=\"_new\">Orientation.com</a>, which she joined last year, her job is to launch web portals. She's tackling Argentina and Egypt next, and thinking about Moldova, the Baltic countries, the Dominican Republic and Panama. </p> <p>Orientation.com has launched six regional and 22 national portals, and Kogan says they want at least 50. </p> <p>This \"bottom up\" approach to world domination contrasts with the usual approach of the biggest companies: start in the US, by far the biggest market, then expand into the UK and Japan. The UK provides a bridge into Europe, and Japan into Asia, which leaves most of Eastern Europe and Africa way down the list. </p> <p>How long will Bulgaria, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and the United Arab Emirates have to wait before America Online and Yahoo! get around to them? All five already have portals on Orientation's network. </p> <p>Rolling out portals in some places is tough for a variety of reasons. One is language. <a href=\"http://in.orientation.com\" target=\"_new\">Orientation India</a>, for example, is available in both Hindi and English, while <a href=\"http://ht.orientation.com\" target=\"_new\">Orientation Haiti</a> is in English and Creole. </p> <p><a href=\"-\" http: ma.orientation.com\"target=\"_new\">Orientation Morocco</a> will soon be available in English, French, and Arabic. \"We try to be very authentic,\" says Kogan, \"which is part of our long-term positioning.\" </p> <p>Orientation now operates in 11 languages, which Kogan says has involved creating computer codes for languages that didn't have them, such as Bangla [Bengali], Creole and Swahili. </p> <p>The network started in Hong Kong in 1994 with The Black Box, a small software company run by an expatriate American, Jay Tindall. Its products included When Disaster Strikes, an educational CD-rom based on Reuters' material, and Beyond the Nine Dragons, an adventure/travel CD-rom about the Mekong River. </p> <p>In 1994, Black Box also produced one of Hong Kong's first websites, and two years later, it launched Orientation: Asia's Web Directory, the first comprehensive regional directory for Asia. This was followed by Rubani: Africa's Web Directory in 1997, and things took off from there. </p> <p>So why are Kogan and Orientation.com now based in the USA? \"Finance,\" she says. \"The company moved to New York because it was much easier and much quicker to raise funds there.\" </p> <p>Cash was important because the Orientation sites are not designed to make money. Tindall's design was black (from The Black Box and its Black Magic authoring software), and left no space for advertising. The priority was to get market share: income from advertising and e-commerce could come later. </p> <p>However, \"our [business] model's not capital intensive. We operate on a franchise or license model\", says Kogan. \"We partner with local ISPs [internet service providers] and provide them with technology and a co-ordinated identity, but they take on the financial burden.\" Local news agencies, writers and publishers, also provide local content, though Orientation does have strategic global partners. The most important include the BBC World News Service, Lonely Planet (known for its travel guides), and the United Nations. </p> <p>The UN's Sustainable Development Networking Programme [SDNP] supplied the first internet service to 40 developing nations with the aim of encouraging economic growth. But let's not get too carried away with the idea of empowering the downtrodden masses. Orientation's users are, I suggest, mainly rich tourists, corporate travellers and expatriates. </p> <p>\"Our main market is students,\" grins Kogan. \"Kids are shockingly sophisticated about the net: they get it right away. Our primary aim now is to outreach to local businesses and corporate travellers, but we're in the coolest - or hottest - travel destinations, and the travel industry loves it.\" </p> <p>Orientation's long-term view is that its portals will cater for their local markets as net use grows from today's minuscule levels. Kogan argues that there's also a value in providing unbiased information \"as best we can, in its truest form. We haven't got any censors on our site, and I can tell you authoritatively that we never will.\" </p> <p>After listening to Kogan, I suspect that Orientation.com is a sitting duck. Companies like Yahoo! and America Online will sooner or later want portals in every country in the world, and the fastest way to get them will be to take over Orientation.com. </p> <p>\"I'll bet Tim Koogle has you in his sights right now,\" I say. </p> <p>\"Koogle?\" </p> <p>\"Koogle! Runs Yahoo!\" </p> <p>\"Oh, I forget his name a lot,\" says Kogan, and changes the subject. </p> <p>Becoming a takeover victim might be unfortunate but should make Orientation.com fabulously rich.

There's a lot to dislike: it uses frames, it's too fussy, it's horribly slow, and the shortage of alt-tags (labels) means you have to wait for graphics to download.

OK, he's not in the Laetitia Casta class, in web terms, but those hooked on the adventures of JK Rowling's boy wizard there are a few sites worth looking at. Jenna's Unofficial Harry Potter Fan Club site offers The Encyclopedia Potterica, and there's another unofficial site, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, nearby. Potter publishers have official sites in the US and the UK. The latter includes the opening chapter of Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets to get visitors hooked. Doctor on call There's a rash of health sites on the web and Surgery Door ) is one of the more ambitious British examples. It has 60 sections with more than 5,000 core pages, details of all local health services, an on-line pharmacy, and a \"resident\" doctor: practising GP Dr Mark Porter. There's a lot to dislike: it uses frames, it's too fussy, it's horribly slow, and the shortage of alt-tags (labels) means you have to wait for graphics to download. It will be interesting to see if the similar-sounding NetDoctor - launched this week - does a better job. Another new site, Alive2000, is devoted to \"health, fitness and lifestyle\". It provides details of more than 800 fitness clubs and centres, and 350 of those are offering free trial workouts to Alive2000 visitors. Unfortunately you have to register to access the website. Finally Allcures claims to be the UK's first full-service online pharmacy. Now you can get a subscription filled or buy medicines from home, or even from your sickbed - and benefit from special offers and a reward points scheme. Yep Yep is a new \"power tool\" for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and 5 web browsers. The software provides instant chat with other Yep users at the same site at the same time, has a \"follow-me\" feature so \"Yepsters\" can lead one another around, and lets users post reminder notes to themselves on the web. Yep keeps personal surfing statistics (time spent online etc) and also feeds information to Yep.com, WebSideStory's portal. Yep.com rates websites by quality and popularity, with frequently bizarre results. The Yep plug-in can be downloaded from http://get.yep.com Sales pitch The German online auction house, Ricardo.de, has just opened a site in the UK at www.goricardo.co.uk as part of its global expansion plans. What makes Ricardo.de different is that it features 10 hours of live-moderated auctions daily. The UK site isn't very active at the moment, but the company says it will be promoted this month, and ultimately \"it aims to become the largest single point of trading in the UK\". The first items to be auctioned when the site goes live, it says, include Formula One racing cars and outfits, Lennox Lewis's boxing gloves, a Tiger Moth biplane, and a one-man submarine. Join the crew Take one! Two new websites are now fighting for the affections of Britain's TV and film production workers. Ultimatefilm.com is taking a businesslike approach with an online diary and website-to-mobile phone link, and makes you register. Produxion.com is livelier and looks more like a portal. Its news stories and other features certainly offer more to the casual visitor.

      "body": "<p>Fifteen years ago, Avril Dunn's body was found in a shed near her Luton home. Today Duncan Jackson completes the first week of his life sentence for her murder. The passing of the years might have made Jackson believe he had got away with the crime, but time has also been on the side of the forensic scientist. DNA tests, impossible at the time of the murder, last week proved Jackson was the killer.</p> <p> Criminals now need more than a pair of gloves to avoid detection; leaving the smallest trace of almost anything at a crime scene is a disaster. A fleck of dandruff, a single skin cell or a tiny drop of saliva is enough to isolate DNA and link the criminal to the scene. \"Science is moving so quickly that we can detect minute traces that they can't avoid leaving,\" says Detective Inspector Richard Leary, of the West Midlands police. But detectives have a new headache: information overload. Linking and cross-matching mountains of scientific evidence with crime scenes requires keen minds and razor-sharp memories. Or a computer.</p> <p>Leary has created a digital assistant for detectives Flints: the Forensic Led Intelligence System. It is still being polished by the West Midlands police, but it has already helped to put many of the names in its memory behind bars. Darren Baker (not his real name), for example, is a serial burglar: branches of Boots were his speciality. The software highlights such patterns. He left blood at the scene of a couple of break-ins; his blood DNA profile was already in police records and gave them his name. The program mapped out his geography; by the time he had reached nearly 20 entries in the database, they predicted his next move and caught Baker red-handed. </p> <p>Several other forces are queuing up to buy the software. \"You cut down vastly on research time,\" says Detective Constable John Hillsmith of the West Midlands intelligence bureau. \"I might have a fingerprint hit for a certain crime scene, and some blood from another. Previously, I would have had to research several databases and get several mountains of paper out to discover that these matters were linked.\" </p> <p>Flints takes much of the guesswork, the legwork and the paperwork out of investigating \"high-volume\" crimes, like burglary and car theft which have stretched police resources to breaking point. Leary is convinced that Flints will do away with case by case investigations. \"That's not what we need to do now - technology and science enable us to investigate whole rafts of cases at the same time.\" In fact, he says, dealing with forensic information, it's not even worth thinking in terms of cases. \"You shift your mindset: it's not 25 or 30 cases, but 25 or 30 strategic lumps of data.\"</p> <p>Flints is designed to handle case files distilled down to individual pieces of provable information. Scene of crime officers gather raw evidence, and the fingerprints bureau and the forensic science service checks it against its records. Any matches are passed to Flints. From this month it will also hold records of handwriting and footprint evidence. </p> <p>Given all this information, the program points out that Johnny Bloggs - a petty thief - has the same DNA profile or fingerprints as Jimmy Briggs. And Jimmy Briggs is connected with 17 car thefts across the West Midlands. So Johnny Bloggs has his alias blown, and gets picked up for a huge string of offences.</p> <p>Once the computer has shown the link between convicted criminals and unsolved crimes, many of the people involved - even those already behind bars - have held up their hands to the offences.</p> <p>Flints is even more useful in sector policing, used by West Midlands and many other forces. The area is split into 21 operational command units. The problem is that people tend to concentrate on crimes committed in their own sector: two cars could be stolen from different sides of a boundary road and different units would investigate. Three or four units could end up chasing the same man; each unit has had to work without knowing that its neighbours are on the same hunt. Lack of resources, and the abundance of paper-based records don't help. ] But once Flints records a link between a person and a crime, the information, is sent to the relevant OCU. The next day Flints might link the same person with a crime in a different sector, but the package is sent to the same OCU.</p> <p>This system lets detectives leap several layers of the investigative process: there's no hunting through thousands of fingerprint records in dusty basements, no sitting for half a day on a hunch, trying to \"lateral-think\" the link between crimes. \"The traditional approach is that you throw yourself into a great big cauldron of information and hope you'll find something of interest,\" says Leary. \"This system simply helps us to manage our evidence better.\"</p> <p>Type your hunch in to Flints and you get immediate results. \"By asking the database questions about links, associations and patterns you can build evidence networks,\" Leary says. Everything in the database is hard fact: evidence and simple associations. Its answers are therefore admissible in court; Leary is looking forward to the day when a courtroom can examine the Flints database for itself.</p> <p> Another possible output is geography: type in a name and you can see the locations of a criminal's handiwork. One such map showed a neat line of industrial burglaries. A glance at the map shows the burglar was simply running up and down the M6 spotting sites to hit.</p> <p>As the links accumulate, an investigating officer at the OCU has to make decisions about what to do. They might make an arrest based on the evidence, or they might bring the suspect in for questioning. Or they might watch for developments. The database doesn't make detectives redundant, Leary insists. \"The system is not designed to promote innocence or guilt; it's designed to manage the information. We should use computers for counting, and the human brain for inferential analysis.\"</p> <p>West Midlands has the Flints database on just a few computers at its headquarters and in one OCU. During the next few months that will expand to more of the OCUs and eventually, Leary hopes, on to the force intranet. Greater Manchester police and the Lancashire force will begin using it in April. The database is Windows-based and easy to pick up, Leary says, but it does require a shift in attitude. Online scientific fact - not the policeman's hunch - is the new basis for action and deduction.</p> <p>The upper ranks are aware of the possible resistance to new methods, but are committed to them. \"This technology has major implications for crime detection across the country,\" says Chris Sims, assistant chief constable with the West Midlands force. \"Although these new investigative techniques won't completely replace traditional policing methods, they will have a major impact.\"</p> <p>But there is a cost. Collecting evidence from car crimes and domestic burglaries uses a lot of man hours, and testing for DNA profiles from blood or skin cells is an expensive business. Evidence gathering capabilities may have soared in the last few years, but budgets have not necessarily followed.</p> <p>Leary is confident that they will. Science and technology are now part of society: it makes sense to harness them for policing, he says. But it won't be long before car thieves and burglars cotton on to the new strategies, and adapt their behaviour. Rival criminals might start sprinkling a stolen car with their enemy's dandruff, or collecting useful blood from a close encounter and casually dropping it into a burgled house. \"Whilst we change our methods, so do criminals,\" Leary admits. \"What we need to do is make sure our science and technology stay ahead of the game.\" But scene of crime officers have already begun to pinpoint the areas of a car in which they find the best, most conclusive evidence (they're not telling, for fear of giving criminals a leg-up). So, Leary says, such practices are unlikely to fool them. Anyway, he adds, the villains are currently unaware of the technology on their trail, and won't know what to do about it when they do find out.</p> <p>In fact, telling the criminals about Flints might be a useful ruse. During a recent crackdown on burglary, the West Midlands force sent letters to known operators in the area under scrutiny. We're tightening things up round here, it said. Don't offend, because you will get caught. It's not hard to imagine a development of this tactic in the era of the electronic policeman. Look out for the automatic email from police headquarters: \"We have recorded your fingerprints and DNA at several local burglaries. To avoid unpleasantness, please drop in for questioning. Regards\".</p> <p><strong>Single cell that brought killer to a prison cell</strong><br> The Forensic Science Service's latest DNA test can prove that there might be a total of six people on the planet whose DNA would match the sample found on Avril Dunn's body. One of those people happened to be Duncan Jackson, who was questioned by the police about the murder 15 years ago.</p> <p>At the time of the murder, there wasn't enough evidence to support a charge. Now the FSS needs only a single cell to pinpoint the \"one in a billion\" who match its DNA. Dried-up blood or semen, a speck of dandruff, or an eyelash left on the victim all contain enough DNA to identify a suspect. </p> <p>Last year, the FSS used the technique to resolve the 1993 murder of Jean Bellis: tiny specks of blood were preserved under the polish on the shoes of her boyfriend, Peter Hastings. The SGM Plus technique enabled the FSS to extract DNA from the blood, and use it to secure Hastings' conviction.</p> <p>Combining these forensic science techniques with electronics could allow scene of crime officers to identify their suspects within minutes. Electronic scanning of fingerprints to check them against computerised archives is being tested. </p> <p>Obtaining a DNA profile involves a series of laboratory techniques. But FSS researchers are developing a hand-held DNA scanner to process samples at the crime scene then use a modem link to check the result against the national DNA database.</p> <p>The FSS will probably have to wait five years for their first hand-held scanner, and genetic photofits are even further into the future. </p> <p>But civil liberties groups are already becoming concerned by the new technologies. Mary Cunneen, a spokesperson for civil rights group Liberty is concerned that although the law allows people to watch their paper fingerprint records being destroyed, there is no way to check that DNA profiles are being removed from the national database when suspects are cleared.</p>",

The upper ranks are aware of the possible resistance to new methods, but are committed to them. \"This technology has major implications for crime detection across the country,\" says Chris Sims, assistant chief constable with the West Midlands force. \"Although these new investigative techniques won't completely replace traditional policing methods, they will have a major impact.\" But there is a cost. Collecting evidence from car crimes and domestic burglaries uses a lot of man hours, and testing for DNA profiles from blood or skin cells is an expensive business. Evidence gathering capabilities may have soared in the last few years, but budgets have not necessarily followed. Leary is confident that they will. Science and technology are now part of society: it makes sense to harness them for policing, he says. But it won't be long before car thieves and burglars cotton on to the new strategies, and adapt their behaviour. Rival criminals might start sprinkling a stolen car with their enemy's dandruff, or collecting useful blood from a close encounter and casually dropping it into a burgled house. \"Whilst we change our methods, so do criminals,\" Leary admits. \"What we need to do is make sure our science and technology stay ahead of the game.\" But scene of crime officers have already begun to pinpoint the areas of a car in which they find the best, most conclusive evidence (they're not telling, for fear of giving criminals a leg-up). So, Leary says, such practices are unlikely to fool them. Anyway, he adds, the villains are currently unaware of the technology on their trail, and won't know what to do about it when they do find out. In fact, telling the criminals about Flints might be a useful ruse. During a recent crackdown on burglary, the West Midlands force sent letters to known operators in the area under scrutiny. We're tightening things up round here, it said. Don't offend, because you will get caught. It's not hard to imagine a development of this tactic in the era of the electronic policeman. Look out for the automatic email from police headquarters: \"We have recorded your fingerprints and DNA at several local burglaries. To avoid unpleasantness, please drop in for questioning. Regards\". Single cell that brought killer to a prison cell The Forensic Science Service's latest DNA test can prove that there might be a total of six people on the planet whose DNA would match the sample found on Avril Dunn's body. One of those people happened to be Duncan Jackson, who was questioned by the police about the murder 15 years ago. At the time of the murder, there wasn't enough evidence to support a charge. Now the FSS needs only a single cell to pinpoint the \"one in a billion\" who match its DNA. Dried-up blood or semen, a speck of dandruff, or an eyelash left on the victim all contain enough DNA to identify a suspect. Last year, the FSS used the technique to resolve the 1993 murder of Jean Bellis: tiny specks of blood were preserved under the polish on the shoes of her boyfriend, Peter Hastings. The SGM Plus technique enabled the FSS to extract DNA from the blood, and use it to secure Hastings' conviction. Combining these forensic science techniques with electronics could allow scene of crime officers to identify their suspects within minutes. Electronic scanning of fingerprints to check them against computerised archives is being tested. Obtaining a DNA profile involves a series of laboratory techniques. But FSS researchers are developing a hand-held DNA scanner to process samples at the crime scene then use a modem link to check the result against the national DNA database. The FSS will probably have to wait five years for their first hand-held scanner, and genetic photofits are even further into the future. But civil liberties groups are already becoming concerned by the new technologies. Mary Cunneen, a spokesperson for civil rights group Liberty is concerned that although the law allows people to watch their paper fingerprint records being destroyed, there is no way to check that DNA profiles are being removed from the national database when suspects are cleared.",

The beginnings of the epidemic can be traced to nearly 30 years earlier than the date currently accepted. Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory claimed to have traced the Aids evolutionary tree back to around 1930, challenging one of the most widely accepted theories that the Aids epidemic surfaced in the late 50s when a chimpanzee virus accidentally entered a polio vaccine being tested in what was then the Belgian Congo. Dr Bette Korber, head of the research team, told the Seventh Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections that the virus could even be traced as far back as 1910, but 1930 seemed the likeliest date.

The growing crisis sparked new fears that a coup was imminent and rocked Jakarta's financial markets. Only hours after Mr Wahid, who is on a 16-day overseas tour, had said in London that he wanted Gen Wiranto to resign immediately, the cocksure former armed forces commander strode confidently into yesterday's cabinet meeting and sat down next to Mr Wahid's empty chair. He smiled for the cameras but declined to answer questions on his future, which has hung by a thread ever since the country's human rights commission on Monday implicated him in the crimes against humanity committed by the Indonesian army and police during and after the independence referendum in East Timor. The report said Gen Wiranto had full knowledge of the widespread murder, arson, forced evacuation and sexual abuse of women by his troops, but did nothing to stop it. After the report was published, Mr Wahid immediately said Gen Wiranto should step down, although he did not say when. On Tuesday, Mr Wiranto belligerently ignored the demand and said: \"As a soldier, I am going to continue to fight to reveal the truth.\" He insists that rather than being involved in the violence, he was instrumental in efforts to maintain the peace in East Timor. Mr Wahid, who is keen to demonstrate his adherence to international standards of human rights, fired back that it would be better if Gen Wiranto temporarily resigned at once. But the Muslim cleric turned politician is not thought to be helping his own cause. For reasons that he is not willing to explain, Mr Wahid is refusing to confront Gen Wiranto personally, but is instead acting through the media and intermediaries. The first order for Gen Wiranto to resign was given during a press interview, while the second was made via the minister of defence, Juwono Sudarsono, who technically is Gen Wiranto's subordinate. Mr Sudarsono was mysteriously absent from yesterday's cabinet meeting. \"Gus Dur [Mr Wahid's nickname] has his own way of emphasising things,\" said the veteran politician Sarwono Kusumaatmadja. \"His way of working is quite original, but it has worked so far.\" By keeping people guessing and off balance, Mr Wahid has thus far managed to juggle the many competing political elements in his cabinet. However, analysts and diplomats were less confident about Mr Wahid's actions. \"If Wahid was not willing to wield the axe himself, he should have told Megawati [Sukarnoputri, the vice-president] to do it,\" one western diplomat said. \"Perhaps he does not trust her.\" Adding to the dilemma is the military's failure to support Mr Wahid.

It foresaw a ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, a partial withdrawal of Moroccan troops and a referendum allowing the people of Western Sahara to choose between independence and integration with Morocco.</p> <p>Ten years on, the region's estimated 300,000 inhabitants are still waiting for the poll, amid an extraordinary dispute about who is qualified to vote.</p> <p>At first, the electorate was to consist of voters identified in a census by the Spanish in 1974. Then the UN decided to broaden the criteria by admitting members of all 88 clans of the 10 nomadic Saharan tribes listed in the Spanish survey.</p> <p>Polisario objected furiously, considering it an attempt by Morocco to pad out the electorate with descendants of tribesmen who may have migrated elsewhere but who were likely to be loyal to Rabat.</p> <p>Morocco argues that in a nomadic, largely illiterate society, the evidence of ties to the region and eligibility to vote can only realistically be based on oral testimony, rather than formal documents a quarter of a century old.</p> <p>\"We had examples in the same family of fathers being accepted and sons or brothers or aunts being rejected,\" said the Moroccan prime minister, Abdulrahman Youssoufi. \"It was an absurd situation: under the original criteria the present leaders of Polisario themselves would not be eligible to vote.\"</p> <p>For six years the two sides have been haggling over the cases of some 200,000 potential voters, under the glazed eyes of the 350-odd members of the UN mission for the referendum in western Sahara (Minurso).</p> <p>It is an exhausting process, and it is why so many unhappy families are still in those shacks outside Laayoune. They are photographed, fingerprinted, then interviewed by UN officers in the presence of officials from both sides.</p> <p>Oral testimony of their Saharan origins can only be provided by sheikhs recog nised back in 1974. Since many of those have died or are too weak to travel, the whole process is delayed further.</p> <p>In the meantime Rabat has invested massively, building schools, hospitals and sports centres in what looks like a blatant attempt to buy loyalty.</p> <p>To win over voters, the new young king, Mohammed VI, has founded a royal commission to look into the Saharan people's grievances, and he seems as popular here as he is elsewhere in Morocco.</p> <p>But equally importantly, he has made overtures to the Algerian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and hinted at the possibility of limited autonomy for the region if it remains under Moroccan sovereignty.</p> <p>This, the returned Moroccan leftwing leader Abraham Serfaty argues, is the first glimmer of hope in decades. \"A referendum is not the answer,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Victor and vanquished cannot be a solution in such an explosive region. The two sides need to sit down and hammer out an arrangement.\"</p>",

When they eventually did, the independence fighters of the rebel Polisario Front, armed and backed by Algeria, lost no time in declaring a Saharan Arab Democratic Republic in exile, and embarked on a sporadic war of attrition. After one failed reconciliation attempt in 1981, a United Nations deal finally ended the fighting in 1990. It foresaw a ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, a partial withdrawal of Moroccan troops and a referendum allowing the people of Western Sahara to choose between independence and integration with Morocco. Ten years on, the region's estimated 300,000 inhabitants are still waiting for the poll, amid an extraordinary dispute about who is qualified to vote. At first, the electorate was to consist of voters identified in a census by the Spanish in 1974. Then the UN decided to broaden the criteria by admitting members of all 88 clans of the 10 nomadic Saharan tribes listed in the Spanish survey. Polisario objected furiously, considering it an attempt by Morocco to pad out the electorate with descendants of tribesmen who may have migrated elsewhere but who were likely to be loyal to Rabat. Morocco argues that in a nomadic, largely illiterate society, the evidence of ties to the region and eligibility to vote can only realistically be based on oral testimony, rather than formal documents a quarter of a century old. \"We had examples in the same family of fathers being accepted and sons or brothers or aunts being rejected,\" said the Moroccan prime minister, Abdulrahman Youssoufi. \"It was an absurd situation: under the original criteria the present leaders of Polisario themselves would not be eligible to vote.\" For six years the two sides have been haggling over the cases of some 200,000 potential voters, under the glazed eyes of the 350-odd members of the UN mission for the referendum in western Sahara (Minurso). It is an exhausting process, and it is why so many unhappy families are still in those shacks outside Laayoune. They are photographed, fingerprinted, then interviewed by UN officers in the presence of officials from both sides. Oral testimony of their Saharan origins can only be provided by sheikhs recog nised back in 1974. Since many of those have died or are too weak to travel, the whole process is delayed further. In the meantime Rabat has invested massively, building schools, hospitals and sports centres in what looks like a blatant attempt to buy loyalty. To win over voters, the new young king, Mohammed VI, has founded a royal commission to look into the Saharan people's grievances, and he seems as popular here as he is elsewhere in Morocco. But equally importantly, he has made overtures to the Algerian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and hinted at the possibility of limited autonomy for the region if it remains under Moroccan sovereignty. This, the returned Moroccan leftwing leader Abraham Serfaty argues, is the first glimmer of hope in decades. \"A referendum is not the answer,\" he said. \"Victor and vanquished cannot be a solution in such an explosive region. The two sides need to sit down and hammer out an arrangement.\"",

After 10 days of fraught negotiations the two parties announced yesterday that they would campaign on a joint manifesto and govern together under the socialist leader Joaquin Almunia if they won. The pact is the first time Spain's divided left has come together since the country became a democracy after the death of the dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975. Mr Aznar had been the favourite to win but the pact now puts him neck and neck with Mr Almunia. An opinion poll published last weekend by newspaper Vanguardia gave the conservative Popular party 42.5% of the vote, the socialists 37% and the mainly communist United Left (IU) 7.5%. The announcement of an alliance came after days of tense talks in which the IU firmly resisted a Socialist proposal that it refrain from fielding candidates in provinces where it had never won a seat. Mr Almunia, a Basque lawyer who took over from the long-serving prime minister Felipe Gonzalez after he lost the last election in 1996, argued that Spain leaned naturally to the left and that both parties needed to exploit that advantage. In 1996, the Socialists and United Left won 2.5m votes more than the PP which, he said, could have meant a 24 seat advantage in parliament.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The race to be London's mayor is, as we're constantly reminded, a battle of personalities. This is usually held to be a bad thing, an easy opportunity for backstage spinners to murmur that Frank Dobson is depressed, Steven Norris is sexually incontinent, or Ken Livingstone is a \"sad and lonely\" egomaniac - and heaven forbid we should ever get one of those in a position of political power.</p> <p>But those who criticise the focus on personalities seem to have overlooked a side-effect of the phenomenon which has rather happier ramifications for voter education. Instead of being forced to rely on indigestible manifestoes, or five-second policy soundbites, Labour members choosing their candidate and voters choosing their mayor will have access to a vast, intimate and revealing storehouse of information: the seemingly endless column-inches of \"Me and My Toothbrush\"-style celebrity question-and-answer features in the press into which all concerned have been vigorously insinuating themselves for the best part of a year.</p> <p>So what if you can't put a cigarette paper between most of the contenders on poverty, housing or public transport? Far more telling, in this contest of personalities, are the full facts about Glenda's most memorable holiday, Frank's favourite play, Ken's most enjoyable sitcom and, most intriguing of all, the smell that Steven Norris thinks is second only to sex. (It's the smell in the kitchen just before Sunday lunch is served, if you were wondering. Try finding that in his official manifesto.)</p> <p>On one level, of course, these slots provide unbounded opportunities for the setting out of political stalls.

      "bodyText": "The race to be London's mayor is, as we're constantly reminded, a battle of personalities. This is usually held to be a bad thing, an easy opportunity for backstage spinners to murmur that Frank Dobson is depressed, Steven Norris is sexually incontinent, or Ken Livingstone is a \"sad and lonely\" egomaniac - and heaven forbid we should ever get one of those in a position of political power. But those who criticise the focus on personalities seem to have overlooked a side-effect of the phenomenon which has rather happier ramifications for voter education. Instead of being forced to rely on indigestible manifestoes, or five-second policy soundbites, Labour members choosing their candidate and voters choosing their mayor will have access to a vast, intimate and revealing storehouse of information: the seemingly endless column-inches of \"Me and My Toothbrush\"-style celebrity question-and-answer features in the press into which all concerned have been vigorously insinuating themselves for the best part of a year. So what if you can't put a cigarette paper between most of the contenders on poverty, housing or public transport? Far more telling, in this contest of personalities, are the full facts about Glenda's most memorable holiday, Frank's favourite play, Ken's most enjoyable sitcom and, most intriguing of all, the smell that Steven Norris thinks is second only to sex. (It's the smell in the kitchen just before Sunday lunch is served, if you were wondering. Try finding that in his official manifesto.) On one level, of course, these slots provide unbounded opportunities for the setting out of political stalls. Norris is particularly unsubtle in this respect, as he demonstrates in the Daily Mail's Me and My Health. \"Physically, you could say my greatest qualification for being mayor of London is my thoroughly aldermanic figure,\" he notes optimistically of his 17-stone vastness. There's plenty of consolation here for those who seek a strong sense of family values in their politicians.

      "body": "<p>When Norma Perez brought the news to the small town of Esperanza, it spread as only rumours in Cuba can. A spindly woman in her 50s, Norma talks in an urgent conspiratorial whisper, at a speed which even Cubans find hard to follow. The Contreras fortune, she told people, really exists. The money is sitting in the vaults of the Bank of England waiting to be claimed. She heard it from a friend who used to be a bodyguard of Fidel Castro, who had heard them talking about it in the Council of State. It must be true. The other heirs were already organising to reclaim it. If the Contreras did not hurry, they would get left out.</p> <p>Norma's news unleashed a gold fever which has spread the length and breadth of the communist-ruled island, even crossing over to the mainland US and Florida. The story of the Contreras lost gold is an old one, passed down over at least a century. But it has found its most fertile ground to reflower in today's Cuba of frustrated dreams, uncertainties and shortages.</p> <p>The full version is told in a series of highly sensationalist articles published in the Cuban magazine Bohemia in 1946, now being photo-copied and passed from hand to hand in villages across the country.</p> <p>The tale starts with Don Francisco Manzo de Contreras, King Phillip II of Spain's chief justice for the Indies. He arrived in Cuba to clean up smuggling in 1599. He settled in the town of Remedios on Cuba's north coast and over the next 150 years the family became exceedingly rich.</p> <p>In 1776, according to Bohemia, the sole heirs of the fortune were three nuns. The articles describe in great detail how, frightened of pirate raids, they secretly took six chests of gold from their hiding place in the walls of the Santa Clara convent in the dead of night and sent them off to London with a trusted nephew, Joseph Manzo de Contreras y Perez de Prado.</p> <p>The magazine quotes florid conversations between Don Francisco and his trusted servant and between the nuns and their nephew, along with descriptions of the voyage and a portrait of Joseph standing proudly in London - all, it seems, the product of the journalist's highly vivid imagination.</p> <p>The final article features a group of humble sweet-makers in the small village of Majagua in central Cuba - heirs of the \"bounteous fortune\", who, says the chronicler, are about to become millionaires. Fifty-four years later, Angel Contreras, one of those interviewed, is still waiting for a fortune which so far has only brought the family misfortune.</p> <p>Majagua is a hot, dusty little town with a typical Cuban mix of old-style red-tiled houses and Soviet apartment blocks. There is a factory for canning fruit preserves, but the family sweet-making business long since succumbed to collectivisation. Angel assures me that in the 1920s his great-grandfather once had the receipt from the Bank of England. But it did him little good.</p> <p>\"They put him in a madhouse,\" Angel says, \"and then they killed him. All for greed. They wanted the money.\" Angel is never precise about exactly who \"they\" were. However, they never got the receipt because his uncle had hidden it. Unfortunately, he too was murdered and the receipt has remained lost ever since.</p> <p>Of course in Cuba such things no longer happen, he tells me. But outside, in London or the capitalist world, he warns, I had better be careful.</p> <p>\"You should have a bodyguard,\" he says. \"And make sure you are not followed. Otherwise they will wait until you are close to the inheritance - and then kill you!\"</p> <p>After Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cubans had other dreams to occupy their minds and the inheritance was forgotten for a while. The new National Bank president, Ernesto Guevara, summed up the revolutionary attitude to money by signing the notes with a derisory \"Che\".</p> <p>But the collapse of the Soviet bloc has brought the island back down to earth with a crash. There is still support for the practical achievements of the revolution, the health and education systems and low levels of crime. But the end of the millennium has left many people casting around for something in which to believe.</p> <p>The news that Norma brought spread quickly. Members of the Manzo and Loyola families, also heirs, were organising to get the money, she said. The Contreras - who are mostly descended from African slaves - were going to get left out.</p> <p>Over the next six months, led by a fiery orator called Roberto Perez, who is married to a member of the family, the Contreras got to work. They put out messages on the local radio to contact all the possible heirs. Committees were formed to draw up family trees. Roberto travelled up and down the country holding public meetings in town halls, accompanied always by a large man of few words who he only half-jokingly referred to as his bodyguard.</p> <p>Roberto spoke with the passion of a born-again preacher - but using the slogans of the revolution. He assured people that the inheritance had never been recovered before the revolution because only individual heirs had applied. It would be different if all the heirs reclaimed it.</p> <p>\"I've said it a thousand times,\" he told a crowd of several thousand in the city of Camaguey. \"Our strength is in unity.\"</p> <p>It's a slogan which everyone in Cuba has heard many times. Through unity, Roberto said, they would also find the missing documents needed to prove their claim.</p> <p>He called the meetings \"family gatherings\". He assured his audiences that he had informed the Council of State what they were doing. But, he said, the state is not involved.</p> <p>Of course no one believed him. For 40 years nothing has moved in Cuba without Communist party authorisation. How could such a movement grow up, with announcements on state-controlled radio, without government involvement?</p> <p>\"Why don't they just tell us whether it is true or not?\" was the constant complaint.</p> <p>Roberto was too autocratic to last long. He was also accused of deviating funds to hold unauthorised events, such as a pig roast. He was ousted from the leadership by a collective decision - intended to re-impose order. In fact it led to more division.

The Manzos in Miami are waging their own battle. Last month they occupied the street in front of the British consulate in Miami. They shouted slogans against the Queen, accusing her of sending their money to the tyrant Fidel Castro through British aid programmes in Cuba. Nine of them were arrested for causing a disturbance.</p> <p>Adelaida Leopo, the church archivist at Remedios, back where it all started in 1599, has also been busy.

It was propped up precariously on a pile of bricks but was still replete with tyres; the rust made it clear the only place the Merc was going was to pot.</p> <p>Not to be put off by mere trifles such as a wrecked car - which in times of crisis also doubles as the diplomatic residence - we arrange to meet the statesman-cum-legal-warrior in his village. Dunvegan is to be found at the not-so-pretty north-west corner of Skye: it's the village that coach tours pass through on the way to the castle, though the less upmarket ones occasionally stop off at the shabby hotel.</p> <p>For the moment, it is also the home of Robbie the Pict, founder of the state of Pictland of Alba, and, as far as the Scottish executive and anyone with even a passing connection to the Skye bridge is concerned, the biggest pain in the arse to descend from the Highlands since accordion music.</p> <p>Robbie the Pict presents many problems - not least being how you address him: Mr Pict, Mr The Pict or just plain Robbie? But it's the one-time roadie' s obsession with the minutiae of British constitutional law and the lump of concrete and steel which joins Skye to the mainland that offers the greatest pique to all those concerned with such matters.</p> <p>Shortly before Christmas, Robbie lost a long-running appeal about the legitimacy of toll collection on the Skye bridge. As always, he represented himself in court. Robbie may be self-taught, but he is experienced in all things legal. So far, on the matter of the bridge alone, he has represented himself in 56 court cases. In theory, there are another 53 cases to come. There's also the small matter of organising the defence of around 400 other people. And plans to mount yet more legal challenges.</p> <p>It is hard to put an exact figure on it, but the tall Highlander with the ginger hair and tweed cap must have cost the various tiers of British government several hundred thousand pounds in legal fees. And even more in annoyance.</p> <p>Along with the continuous court challenges on every possible detail of the bridge, Robbie refuses to pay tax, he has prosecuted the English crown for reset (handling stolen property) and he drives around - when the Merc is not propped up on bricks, that is - in a car with diplomatic number plates and a tax disc registered to Pictland of Alba. There are legal justifications for all these actions, but, when they're found insufficient by courts - and it happens frequently - he happily goes to prison. Then he thinks of some other ground to fight from.</p> <p>\"Being a pain in the arse is not a factor that I am mindful of at all,\" he says, straight faced. \"You can sit and say, 'I would rather drink beer', or you can take responsibility, do what you can do, and it only takes one guy in a court.\" Since the early 80s, Robbie has frequently been that guy. To the rest of us, his initial motivation may seem a little bizarre, but, to the monotonously serious Robbie, it fanned the flames of ancient anger.</p> <p>The one-man legal crusade began with the passing of the British nationality act 1981. Not, all things considered, the most contentious piece of Tory legislation (even internet search engines can only find one mention of it, and that's information on how to buy it). But the act changed the national status of Scots from subjects of the kingdom of Scotland to citizens of the Westminster parliament. This made Robbie rather angry.

      "bodyText": "There was a slight problem with the diplomatic vehicle. The white Mercedes - a vintage model a few decades old - wasn't moving. It was propped up precariously on a pile of bricks but was still replete with tyres; the rust made it clear the only place the Merc was going was to pot. Not to be put off by mere trifles such as a wrecked car - which in times of crisis also doubles as the diplomatic residence - we arrange to meet the statesman-cum-legal-warrior in his village. Dunvegan is to be found at the not-so-pretty north-west corner of Skye: it's the village that coach tours pass through on the way to the castle, though the less upmarket ones occasionally stop off at the shabby hotel. For the moment, it is also the home of Robbie the Pict, founder of the state of Pictland of Alba, and, as far as the Scottish executive and anyone with even a passing connection to the Skye bridge is concerned, the biggest pain in the arse to descend from the Highlands since accordion music. Robbie the Pict presents many problems - not least being how you address him: Mr Pict, Mr The Pict or just plain Robbie? But it's the one-time roadie' s obsession with the minutiae of British constitutional law and the lump of concrete and steel which joins Skye to the mainland that offers the greatest pique to all those concerned with such matters. Shortly before Christmas, Robbie lost a long-running appeal about the legitimacy of toll collection on the Skye bridge. As always, he represented himself in court. Robbie may be self-taught, but he is experienced in all things legal. So far, on the matter of the bridge alone, he has represented himself in 56 court cases. In theory, there are another 53 cases to come. There's also the small matter of organising the defence of around 400 other people. And plans to mount yet more legal challenges. It is hard to put an exact figure on it, but the tall Highlander with the ginger hair and tweed cap must have cost the various tiers of British government several hundred thousand pounds in legal fees. And even more in annoyance. Along with the continuous court challenges on every possible detail of the bridge, Robbie refuses to pay tax, he has prosecuted the English crown for reset (handling stolen property) and he drives around - when the Merc is not propped up on bricks, that is - in a car with diplomatic number plates and a tax disc registered to Pictland of Alba. There are legal justifications for all these actions, but, when they're found insufficient by courts - and it happens frequently - he happily goes to prison. Then he thinks of some other ground to fight from. \"Being a pain in the arse is not a factor that I am mindful of at all,\" he says, straight faced. \"You can sit and say, 'I would rather drink beer', or you can take responsibility, do what you can do, and it only takes one guy in a court.\" Since the early 80s, Robbie has frequently been that guy. To the rest of us, his initial motivation may seem a little bizarre, but, to the monotonously serious Robbie, it fanned the flames of ancient anger. The one-man legal crusade began with the passing of the British nationality act 1981. Not, all things considered, the most contentious piece of Tory legislation (even internet search engines can only find one mention of it, and that's information on how to buy it). But the act changed the national status of Scots from subjects of the kingdom of Scotland to citizens of the Westminster parliament. This made Robbie rather angry. He began mounting his invariably well-researched, if occasionally unlikely, legal challenges. To help him on his way, a solicitor friend on Skye gave Robbie an acre of land to act as base camp for his constitutional crusade. He declared it Pictland of Alba, the Pictish free state. That was just the start. \"I stopped responding to any tax demands and road-tax demands. I registered my vehicle with Pictland of Alba, Rigg, Skye,\" he says. \"I had my own road-tax disc and I put diplomatic plates on the car, for a bit of fun.\" There were plenty, though, who were not exactly amused by Robbie's peculiar wheeze. On the face of it, it appears to be just a blatant attempt to wind up the authorities. But Robbie claims it is an example of the situationism apparently practised by Dutch peasants (it seemed best not to demand further explanation). Shortly after registering his car to Pictland of Alba, he began parking it on double-yellow lines across Edinburgh. Nothing happened; no ticket appeared. Undeterred, he continued parking the car illegally but, after six weeks, still there was nothing. For those who know Edinburgh, this is immediately apparent as nothing short of a miracle: it was obvious that either ethereal forces were involved, or Pictland had been given diplomatic recognition. It was not until Robbie made a trip to Perth a few days later that things started to go a bit wrong, or, for Robbie at least, have the desired intention. While driving through the town, he was stopped by a local policeman. The bobby was mildly amused by Robbie's tales of Pictland, but he phoned through to check the diplomatic number plates. They were the same as those used by the Nigerian embassy. Robbie was arrested for, among other things, impersonating a Nigerian diplomat. \"I went to Perth sheriff court and then to the high court. I was fined but I didn't pay so I went to prison for 40 days,\" he says with discomfiting nonchalance. \"Jail is just an occupational hazard if you decide to take on imperialism.\" His crusades have supplied him with numerous criminal convictions, but, in 1994, Robbie tried to return the favour to the home office.

Maybe it was coincidence. Robbie's next big legal preoccupation began in 1995 - and continues to this day: the Skye bridge. When, in October of that year, Skye was joined to mainland Britain for the first time in thousands of years, the locals did not take kindly to the costs. Tolls to cross the bridge - built under the hugely controversial private finance initiative and currently owned by the Bank of America - were fairly hefty. (Now they are levied at a much-reduced level of \u00a34.70 each way.) So the islanders, led by Robbie, began a campaign of non-payment. This, though, was not the usual island revolt.

A big TV advertising push, designed to restore the store's reputation, is likely to be part of the new campaign. The ailing firm wants to hire a leading creative mainstream agency and is drawing up a shortlist for the pitch. Until now M&amp;S has used one main agency, BMP4, on a contract basis and brought in other agencies for special projects. An M&amp;S spokesman said: \"We are now looking for one big creative agency who will be a strategic partner to build on the strength of the brand.\" As a result BMP4 - which masterminded the firm's fashion advertising last year - will not be part of the repitch, although M&amp;S has not ruled out its parent company. Granada bid faces delay Media and leisure group, Granada, saw its shares fall 29p to 619p yesterday as chairman Gerry Robinson said a competition commission investigation of the firm's proposed takeover bids for Carlton Communications and United Newspapers may take longer than the minimum three months. The group, which expects to hear within the next 10 days whether the office of fair trading will call for a full inquiry of its two-prong intervention in the proposed merger between Carlton and United, said trading in the first quarter of the current financial year had started well and the strong 1999 performance was continuing. Advertising sales were ahead 9%, while and hotel sales were up 5%. The Travelodge business saw its income climb 16% and there was a 5% advance in revenues from the food services and roadside travel catering divisions. The OFT yesterday sent its recommendations to the department of trade and industry on whether to refer the planned Carlton-United tie up to the competition commission. Shoppers head back to basics Off-licences and speciality foods shops suffered from a new year hangover last month, as shoppers went back to basics after splashing out in December. Retail sales growth slowed in January according to the latest snapshot of the sector published yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry. Hardest hit were the shops which had supplied parties over the Christmas and new year period. Off-licences reported that sales were flat, while specialist food shops recorded a fall. The CBI said the figures showed that the economy was already slowing in the aftermath of the three rises in interest rates since last September. However economists said the underlying picture was strong. PO spends \u00a36m on French firm The Post Office continued its expansion into Europe with the \u00a36m acquisition yesterday of Crie, a Paris-based express mail business and the Post Office's fifth international acquisition in the past 12 months.

The surge came as investors focused on Tarpan's potential, backed as it is by Buch and other heavyweight industry players such as Robert Ware, deputy chief executive of property company MEPC. </p> <p>Tarpan will be reborn as i2s with a view to raising \u00a35m to invest in internet companies.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Tarpan, the cash shell controlled by entrepreneur Neville Buch, leapt to new heights yesterday amid expectation that it is poised to relaunch on AIM tomorrow as an investment vehicle specialising in internet companies. The shares closed up 18%, or 120p, at 775p after touching a new high at 785p. The surge came as investors focused on Tarpan's potential, backed as it is by Buch and other heavyweight industry players such as Robert Ware, deputy chief executive of property company MEPC. Tarpan will be reborn as i2s with a view to raising \u00a35m to invest in internet companies. The company said at its interim results in December that it would seek to take advantage of the strong position held by its broker, Peel, Hunt and Company, in the internet and technology flotation market. Buch was chairman of Blenheim Group before its takeover by United News &amp; Media in 1996. He has steadily sold off property and trading assets at Tarpan to reposition it as an internet investment fund. Buch's aim will be to participate primarily in second round financing, where internet companies have completed development work and are looking for funds to make their operations commercially viable.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Michael Nyman and the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen are among Silvestre Revueltas's biggest fans. And yet, apart from a handful of discs and the occasional appearance in concert programmes, his music is hardly known on this side of the Atlantic. In the US and his native Mexico, however, Revueltas's reputation is slowly being consolidated. His centenary - he was born on New Year's Eve 1899 - has given the cause a decisive push. The recent Revueltas festival in Santa Barbara included no fewer than 18 of his works alongside other pieces from Latin America, plus screenings of three films for which Revueltas wrote the soundtracks, a puppet show and an exhibition of manuscripts. </p> <p>The connection between Revueltas and the Californian city is conductor Gisele Ben-Dor, the Uruguayan-born musical director of the Santa Barbara Symphony Orchestra, who has fervently championed his cause for years. It's entirely due to Ben-Dor's energy and enthusiasm that the Revueltas festival took shape: she planned and conducted all the programmes, and brought in the Revueltas scholar Roberto Kolb-Neuhaus from Mexico City to prepare new editions for some of the works. It was a real labour of love for all involved, and endlessly fascinating and revealing for those like me who arrived knowing barely a handful of Revueltas's pieces. </p> <p>It turns out that the man was as colourful as the music he wrote, and that the few of his pieces that are known - the orchestral Sensemaya, the abrasive Ocho por Radio, the naggingly compulsive Homenaje a Federico Garcia Lorca - are by no means just inspired flashes in the pan. In the 30s, the decade in which Revueltas composed all his major works (he died of alcoholism and pneumonia in 1940), he was a consistent and distinctive voice in contemporary music. His work, like that of all true originals, remains obstinately unclassifiable. </p> <p>He's been called a Mexican Charles Ives, but that's a misleading parallel. Ives regularly introduced popular songs and hymn tunes into his scores as points of reference, but he regarded himself as a high-art composer. Revueltas's intentions were very different: he was aiming for a genuine synthesis between popular Mexican music and the Western art-music tradition. The bright, brittle sound of his scoring, the complexity of his rhythms and the acid tang of his harmonies owe as much to the mariachi bands of northern Mexico as they do to the modernist world of Stravinsky, Varese and Bartok, who seem to have been his major European influences. His body of work has a real radical agenda; Revueltas was a revolutionary, and the barriers he sought to break down were musical as well as social. </p> <p>Born in the Mexican province of Durango, Revueltas trained first as a violinist. He studied in the US and remained there to earn his living conducting and playing in theatre bands. During that time he composed very little; the pieces that he did write have a vaguely French flavour and, apart from the odd flash of sardonic humour, neither show individuality nor hint at the music to come. A little piano study from 1924 has no claim to distinction apart from its title, Tragedy in the Form of a Radish, which pokes not-so-gentle fun at Erik Satie. </p> <p>It was only after Revueltas returned home in 1929 to become assistant conductor of the Mexico Symphony Orchestra that his creativity exploded and the first distinctive pieces began to appear. With his fellow conductor-composer Carlos Chavez and painters like Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, he champi oned the cause of a nationalist Mexican art. When a left-wing government was elected in Mexico in 1934 he began writing socialist realist music for the state-sponsored cinema. Some of the films haven't aged well, but Redes (one of Fred Zinnemann's early successess as a director) was screened in Santa Barbara with Revueltas's wonderfully paced, humane score played live by the SBSO under Ben-Dor. </p> <p>In the next five years Revueltas wrote another nine film scores and a stream of concert works; in 1937 he travelled to Spain to join the fight against Franco. He was an alcoholic and possibly a manic depressive, yet his music retained its ebullience to the end of his short life. It's in the clashing mariachi-isms of Ocho, the busy, almost dangerously vapid outer sections of Homenaje, framing a heartfelt lament for Lorca, and the gentle, rather surreal humour of the children's ballet The Wandering Tadpole. </p> <p>Revueltas's pieces, their sound world, their collage-like patterning of themes and essentially non-developmental forms, are products of a genuinely modernist sensibility. He often relies on three-part, fast-slow-fast structures, but within that simple shape the ordering of events and the shifts of perspectives have their own logic, sometimes almost a constructivist basis. </p> <p>Occasionally the language clings too closely to the models: the recently rediscovered children's entertainment Once Upon a Time There Was a King, from 1940, is heavily mortgaged to Stravinsky's Soldier's Tale, while the string-orchestra version of Cuauhnahuac (1931) sounds more like Bartok than Revueltas. But a work like Planos (1934), with its sensuous superposition of independent rhythmic and melodic layers, or the explosive, virtuosic Toccata (without a Fugue), a condensed, one-movement violin concerto from 1933, or the Two Little Serious Pieces for wind (1940) which are anything but conventionally serious, could only have been written by Revueltas. </p> <p>Establishing the boundaries of that creative identity was the Santa Barbara festival's aim. The programmes were sometimes too long (prefacing the screening of Redes with the US premiere of Villa-Lobos's interminably rambling Tenth Symphony was a mistake) and the performances weren't always perfect: this is music that requires rhythmic tautness of a very special order, and the kind of technical expertise that makes the hardest passages seem effortless. Yet they demonstrated inescapably that this is important, devastatingly endearing music. There's no doubt that alongside the Argentinian Astor Piazzolla, and (on a good day) the Brazilian Villa-Lobos, Revueltas is the most considerable figure that Latin American music has yet produced.</p>",

In the 30s, the decade in which Revueltas composed all his major works (he died of alcoholism and pneumonia in 1940), he was a consistent and distinctive voice in contemporary music. His work, like that of all true originals, remains obstinately unclassifiable. He's been called a Mexican Charles Ives, but that's a misleading parallel. Ives regularly introduced popular songs and hymn tunes into his scores as points of reference, but he regarded himself as a high-art composer. Revueltas's intentions were very different: he was aiming for a genuine synthesis between popular Mexican music and the Western art-music tradition. The bright, brittle sound of his scoring, the complexity of his rhythms and the acid tang of his harmonies owe as much to the mariachi bands of northern Mexico as they do to the modernist world of Stravinsky, Varese and Bartok, who seem to have been his major European influences. His body of work has a real radical agenda; Revueltas was a revolutionary, and the barriers he sought to break down were musical as well as social. Born in the Mexican province of Durango, Revueltas trained first as a violinist. He studied in the US and remained there to earn his living conducting and playing in theatre bands. During that time he composed very little; the pieces that he did write have a vaguely French flavour and, apart from the odd flash of sardonic humour, neither show individuality nor hint at the music to come. A little piano study from 1924 has no claim to distinction apart from its title, Tragedy in the Form of a Radish, which pokes not-so-gentle fun at Erik Satie. It was only after Revueltas returned home in 1929 to become assistant conductor of the Mexico Symphony Orchestra that his creativity exploded and the first distinctive pieces began to appear. With his fellow conductor-composer Carlos Chavez and painters like Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, he champi oned the cause of a nationalist Mexican art. When a left-wing government was elected in Mexico in 1934 he began writing socialist realist music for the state-sponsored cinema. Some of the films haven't aged well, but Redes (one of Fred Zinnemann's early successess as a director) was screened in Santa Barbara with Revueltas's wonderfully paced, humane score played live by the SBSO under Ben-Dor. In the next five years Revueltas wrote another nine film scores and a stream of concert works; in 1937 he travelled to Spain to join the fight against Franco. He was an alcoholic and possibly a manic depressive, yet his music retained its ebullience to the end of his short life. It's in the clashing mariachi-isms of Ocho, the busy, almost dangerously vapid outer sections of Homenaje, framing a heartfelt lament for Lorca, and the gentle, rather surreal humour of the children's ballet The Wandering Tadpole. Revueltas's pieces, their sound world, their collage-like patterning of themes and essentially non-developmental forms, are products of a genuinely modernist sensibility. He often relies on three-part, fast-slow-fast structures, but within that simple shape the ordering of events and the shifts of perspectives have their own logic, sometimes almost a constructivist basis. Occasionally the language clings too closely to the models: the recently rediscovered children's entertainment Once Upon a Time There Was a King, from 1940, is heavily mortgaged to Stravinsky's Soldier's Tale, while the string-orchestra version of Cuauhnahuac (1931) sounds more like Bartok than Revueltas. But a work like Planos (1934), with its sensuous superposition of independent rhythmic and melodic layers, or the explosive, virtuosic Toccata (without a Fugue), a condensed, one-movement violin concerto from 1933, or the Two Little Serious Pieces for wind (1940) which are anything but conventionally serious, could only have been written by Revueltas. Establishing the boundaries of that creative identity was the Santa Barbara festival's aim. The programmes were sometimes too long (prefacing the screening of Redes with the US premiere of Villa-Lobos's interminably rambling Tenth Symphony was a mistake) and the performances weren't always perfect: this is music that requires rhythmic tautness of a very special order, and the kind of technical expertise that makes the hardest passages seem effortless. Yet they demonstrated inescapably that this is important, devastatingly endearing music. There's no doubt that alongside the Argentinian Astor Piazzolla, and (on a good day) the Brazilian Villa-Lobos, Revueltas is the most considerable figure that Latin American music has yet produced.",

The informal soundings are expected to take place amid concerns that investors might be divided in their support for the competing \u00a323bn bids by Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland, or independence for NatWest, which would prevent either of the Scottish bidders reaching the 50% takeover hurdle. The anxiety has failed to diminish since the two Scottish bidders revealed their final bids - a complex mix of cash and shares - for NatWest, neither of which was the \"knock out\" blow which the City had hoped for. \"Institutions are notoriously bad at having conversations with each other (but) we'll put feelers out to find out which way people are leaning,\" one major NatWest shareholder said. The shareholder said he had not decided which bidder was better. \"But what do we do? NatWest has been such an embarassment for so long (it's hard) to allow it to continue.\" While difficult to instigate, the private conversations, appear to be an alternative route to pressurising Sir David Rowland, chairman and chief executive of NatWest, to recommend to his board to agree to a takeover. Few shareholders are prepared to reveal their decisions until they have seen the final presentations from the top executives of all three banks. While a few have indicated that they do not want NatWest to survive - notably Standard Life and Jupiter - no British institution has publicly backed either Scottish bank. Others have said they have not yet ruled out backing the newly installed NatWest management team. Shareholders have until Valentine's Day to decide, while analysts are starting to make their recommendations, with WestLB yesterday said to have joined Commerzbank and Teather and Greenwood in backing NatWest. NatWest's shares ended 24p lower at \u00a311.34 - below the value of both bids - while BoS slipped another 13p to 585p while Royal gained 8p to 979p.",

There have even been suspicions that Latimer might have invented the mysterious Alkan and his hour-long unaccompanied piano concerto. </p> <p>Yet Alkan is in the reference books, an assumed name for one Charles-Henri-Valentin Morhange - a French keyboard genius to challenge Liszt and Brahms, whose friends included Chopin and Victor Hugo, yet whose insularity kept him off the Paris recital circuit, locked inside the world of his own obsessively complex compositions. </p> <p>Latimer delivered Alkan's Concerto for Solo Piano as the first half of his St John's show (Exhibitionist at the Pictures), and a somewhat unexpectedly straightforward jazz trio set as the second. The Alkan concerto is in three breathtaking movements, the first alone running to 1,400 bars (more than Beethoven's entire Hammerklavier Sonata, as Latimer points out). The piano almost sounded like a small orchestra in Latimer's hands, and an orchestra calling on a medley of musical references from the baroque to the modern era Alkan never encountered at that. An opening of jackhammer chords is only fitfully alleviated as a gentler lyrical line develops into a firestorm of sound. A hyperbolic reiteration of thunderous climaxes and brief retreats characterises the entire work, which also suggests everything from battlefields to pealing churchbells, to fairground roundabouts and speeding trains. Its fury and impatience with conventional narrative development makes the concerto's obscurity unsurprising. But Latimer's single-minded inspiration about it may change all that. </p> <p>When the dust had settled after the interval, Latimer's classy jazz trio (Mario Castronari on bass, Harold Fisher on drums) first explored standard songs with a diffident, understated elegance that initially made it hard to believe that the same player was at the keyboard. Monk's Round Midnight and an uptempo bop original were followed by Latimer's Exhibitionist at the Pictures suite, a pleasant blend of soft funky grooves, Latin rhythms, urbane walking-blues and fast postbop, with some very inventive improvisation from Castronari. But the free-jazz finale, a piano/ bass duet developing into flying, Cecil Taylor-like percussive chords, both made the connection with the Alkan concerto and seemed closer to Latimer's idiosyncratic soul.</p>",

When the dust had settled after the interval, Latimer's classy jazz trio (Mario Castronari on bass, Harold Fisher on drums) first explored standard songs with a diffident, understated elegance that initially made it hard to believe that the same player was at the keyboard. Monk's Round Midnight and an uptempo bop original were followed by Latimer's Exhibitionist at the Pictures suite, a pleasant blend of soft funky grooves, Latin rhythms, urbane walking-blues and fast postbop, with some very inventive improvisation from Castronari. But the free-jazz finale, a piano/ bass duet developing into flying, Cecil Taylor-like percussive chords, both made the connection with the Alkan concerto and seemed closer to Latimer's idiosyncratic soul.",

      "body": "<p>British Telecom stunned the markets and its own staff yesterday when it announced a drop in profits and sweeping job cuts. </p> <p>The market reacted adversely to the news by marking the group's shares down by more than 17%, reducing its stock market value by \u00a313bn to \u00a363.5bn. </p> <p>The company said it plans to shed 3,000 middle managers over the next nine months in an attempt to reduce the costs of its traditional UK phone business. The decision to axe one in 10 of its management jobs followed a 6% slump in third-quarter profits. </p> <p>Sir Peter Bonfield, BT chief executive, said the job cuts, which will be achieved through a voluntary redundancy programme, will cost \u00a3340m but are designed to save \u00a3140m annually. </p> <p>BT blamed the downturn on reduced margins as a result of competition in the UK fixed-line market, and on higher wage costs. </p> <p>During the past nine months the BT workforce has grown by 13,000 to 137,700 largely as a result of acquisitions and the switching of agency staff to the company payroll. </p> <p>However, 5,200 extra people were taken on to cope with increased demand for the group's mobile and internet services, and to prepare new products. </p> <p>BT, which has shed 120,000 jobs over the past 10 years, is expecting further - although more modest - job cuts in the next few years. </p> <p>Sir Peter said that mobile, internet and overseas ventures such as Japan Telecom and Viag Intercom were the fastest-growing sectors of the business. </p> <p>He added that the group was likely to be more active in increasing its stakes in its overseas ventures when the opportunity occurred. At present it is a minority shareholder in most cases. </p> <p>Third-quarter turnover rose 19% to \u00a35.58bn while underlying operating profit fell 6% to \u00a3817m. </p> <p>Robert Brace, BT's finance director, said he expected a similar operating profit during the fourth quarter. </p> <p>Sir Peter said the group was in a state of transition, with the setting up of its international calls joint venture with the US group AT&amp;T, the shift towards more mobile, internet and data services, and the introduction of its ADSL broadband network. </p> <p>BT Cellnet, the mobile phone business now fully owned by BT, added 1m customers during the quarter, taking its subscriber base to nearly 7m. </p> <p>In addition, the turnover of the mobile communications division was boosted by contributions from the Martin Dawes and DX Communications businesses acquired last year. </p> <p>Turnover of the fixed network in the UK was hit by continuing price reductions, including the Oftel-imposed 25% cut in the cost of calls from fixed to mobile phones. </p> <p>The number of BT residential lines fell by 100,000 to 20m, although this was offset by a rise of 600,000 in the number of business lines and continued growth in the number of second lines. </p> <p>BT is expecting to write down the value of BT Cellnet's analogue network by about \u00a350m.The network is expected to be switched off long before its licence expires in 2005. </p> <p>BT's pre-tax quarterly profits fell from \u00a3858m to \u00a3651m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British Telecom stunned the markets and its own staff yesterday when it announced a drop in profits and sweeping job cuts. The market reacted adversely to the news by marking the group's shares down by more than 17%, reducing its stock market value by \u00a313bn to \u00a363.5bn. The company said it plans to shed 3,000 middle managers over the next nine months in an attempt to reduce the costs of its traditional UK phone business. The decision to axe one in 10 of its management jobs followed a 6% slump in third-quarter profits. Sir Peter Bonfield, BT chief executive, said the job cuts, which will be achieved through a voluntary redundancy programme, will cost \u00a3340m but are designed to save \u00a3140m annually. BT blamed the downturn on reduced margins as a result of competition in the UK fixed-line market, and on higher wage costs. During the past nine months the BT workforce has grown by 13,000 to 137,700 largely as a result of acquisitions and the switching of agency staff to the company payroll. However, 5,200 extra people were taken on to cope with increased demand for the group's mobile and internet services, and to prepare new products. BT, which has shed 120,000 jobs over the past 10 years, is expecting further - although more modest - job cuts in the next few years. Sir Peter said that mobile, internet and overseas ventures such as Japan Telecom and Viag Intercom were the fastest-growing sectors of the business. He added that the group was likely to be more active in increasing its stakes in its overseas ventures when the opportunity occurred. At present it is a minority shareholder in most cases. Third-quarter turnover rose 19% to \u00a35.58bn while underlying operating profit fell 6% to \u00a3817m. Robert Brace, BT's finance director, said he expected a similar operating profit during the fourth quarter. Sir Peter said the group was in a state of transition, with the setting up of its international calls joint venture with the US group AT&amp;T, the shift towards more mobile, internet and data services, and the introduction of its ADSL broadband network. BT Cellnet, the mobile phone business now fully owned by BT, added 1m customers during the quarter, taking its subscriber base to nearly 7m. In addition, the turnover of the mobile communications division was boosted by contributions from the Martin Dawes and DX Communications businesses acquired last year. Turnover of the fixed network in the UK was hit by continuing price reductions, including the Oftel-imposed 25% cut in the cost of calls from fixed to mobile phones. The number of BT residential lines fell by 100,000 to 20m, although this was offset by a rise of 600,000 in the number of business lines and continued growth in the number of second lines. BT is expecting to write down the value of BT Cellnet's analogue network by about \u00a350m.The network is expected to be switched off long before its licence expires in 2005. BT's pre-tax quarterly profits fell from \u00a3858m to \u00a3651m.",

      "body": "<p>In 1896 Chekhov's play had a disastrous first night in St Petersburg. In Stratford-upon-Avon it nearly had an incendiary one. In the first act the curtains of Konstantin's mock-theatre brushed against candle-flame and caught fire. Prompt action by the production manager, Jasper Gilbert, who leapt up on stage and put out the fire prevented the flames spreading and may well have helped save this beautiful wooden theatre. After 10 minutes or so, the play resumed but it was an unnerving experience for actors and audience alike. </p> <p>But how did you enjoy the play, Mrs Lincoln? In the circumstances, it is difficult to say but I feel Adrian Noble's production is a mixed affair. It is full of acute detail, heightens the play's Hamletesque references and has a very Russian sense of atmosphere. Gulls cry, the wind sighs in the trees, waves lap against the lake shore. There is also a heartstopping moment when the characters sit and listen to the sound of distant music and laughter. It not only evokes past happiness but achingly counterpoints the lovelorn sadness that taints Chekhov's people. </p> <p>If there is a reservation in my voice, it has to do with the need for the RSC to revive The Seagull so soon after Terry Hands's superlative production in The Swan. Without wishing to be ageist, Noble's cast is also, in several crucial cases, much older than Chekhov states -something that may not matter in Shakespeare but that is important in realistic drama. The novelist, Trigorin, is meant to be under 40. Nigel Terry, however, presents us with a grizzled figure who makes up for in energy what he lacks in youth. Dorn, the debonair doctor, is only 55. As played by Richard Johnson he becomes an older figure full of grave melancholy. </p> <p>In the case of Penelope Wilton's superb Arkadina, however, age is simply irrelevant. Wilton presents us with an instantly recognisable figure - the dedicated, self-centred actress determined to keep professional or sexual rivals at bay. When she hisses at her son that his symbolist play is \"decadent\" it is because she senses a threat to her own conventional style of theatre. And when she tells Nina \"I'm sure you must have talent\" it is with the casual disdain of someone who spies a potential erotic challenge. </p> <p>Wilton does not judge Arkadina. She shows how talent is always accompanied by insecurity. Justine Waddell's Nina also presents a genuine threat. She has beauty, spirit and the single-minded intensity of the genuinely ambitious. She also makes sense of that treacherous last act where Nina returns emotionally devastated but determined to endure. There is much in Noble's production, as well as Peter Gill's new version, to admire. But it needs time to mature before it sets out on a UK tour - and fireproof curtains. </p> <p> Until February 24. Box office: 01789 403403. This appeared in some editions yesterday. </p>",
