Equally perversely, she has released her album on the embryonic Glaswegian label Spit and Polish, run by the country fanatic and Radio Sweethearts drummer Francis MacDonald. The connection was established when Cantrell played the band's music on her radio show, and they backed her with their distinctive shuffling swing, her brittle voice sometimes clattering up the high registers as if surprised by her Glaswegian cohorts. The music is about familiar busted hearts and road stops in Reno, but is sung with direct honesty and the tiniest twinkle in Cantrell's eyes. She was born in Nashville and was weaned on the bluegrass of Earl Scruggs and Lester Flatt, and she doesn't attempt to hide it. Cantrell delivered a captivating show, with a hint of the nervy edge of the great Mary Margaret O'Hara. Hell, she proves that even Wall Street analysts can get the honky tonk blues. Big Big Country Festival ends tomorrow.",

      "body": "<p>Technology stocks returned to favour with a vengeance yesterday as heavy buying by investors out to recoup losses suffered in recent weeks prompted a 8% jump in the Techmark 100 index. </p> <p>By the close of trading, the technology-driven index had completed its sixth rise in consecutive days to end up 272.9 points at 3634.95, well off recent a lows of 2925 points. </p> <p>The benchmark FTSE 100 closed up 155.9 points at 6626.4, helped by strong performances from mobile phone company Vodafone AirTouch, handheld computer expert Psion and software group Baltimore Technologies. </p> <p>The London market was also helped by a strong early per formance from the US Nasdaq index which was up 5% at 3694.8 at lunchtime. </p> <p>Traders there were buoyed by receding fears of interest rate rises and figures showing a slight rise in unemployment, indicating the Federal Reserve's attempts to keep a lid on the booming economy were succeeding. </p> <p>On the European mainland Italian internet service provider Tiscali added 6%, while Spain's Terra Networks put on 4%. </p> <p>Dealers said they hoped the rally was evidence that the sell-off had bottomed out although they warned that even some of the day's strongest performers remain valued at less than a third of the highs they reached in early March. </p> <p>Among the strongest per formers were NetBenefit which jumped 50% to 562.5p, Geo Interactive which climbed 34% to 870p and Redstone Telecom up 33% at 327.5p. However, all three shares are still trading at less than a third of their levels of two months ago. \"The quality stocks had been tarred with the same brush as those of lower quality and the selling had gone too far,\" one dealer said. \"The quality plays are now returning to sensible levels.\" </p> <p>Spencer Crooks, a director at stockbroker Winterflood Securities, said: \"We've gone from one extreme to another. Everything was too high in March and now it's looking too low. People are showing interest again. The institutions are increasing their weightings and there are fewer distressed sellers out there. The private punter is also coming back into the equation.\" </p> <p>Another dealer said: \"The momentum investors are get ting back on the bandwagon but whether we see the sort of resurgence we saw six months ago remains to be seen.\" </p> <p>Analysts said the increase in volume of shares traded indicated liquidity was returning to the market. Around 15m Freeserve shares changed hands, with QXL.com rising 20p to 140p on volume of 9.6m. News of an agreement with the Microsoft-backed travel site Expedia prompted renewed interest in Lastminute.com. More than 1m shares changed hands as the price rose 21p to 152.5p. </p> <p>Among the bulletin board favourites, Eidos climbed 75p to 380p on the back of unconfirmed rumours of a deal to design games for Nokia Wap phones, while Durlacher was 14p better off at 85p. </p> <p>The return to form was greeted with huge enthusiasm on the Hemmington Scott internet bulletin board. \"YeeeeeeeeeeeeeeHHHaaaaaaa!!!!!!\" said Gambo55. </p> <p>\"Ages since we had a good Yeeeha on the BB,\" replied HectorP. </p> <p>\"Vol. on Naz looks very impressive ... looks like we're in for a long rally. Have a good w/e,\" added Bullish. </p> <p>However, Miles Saltiel, technology analyst at West LB Panmure, urged caution and said he regarded the mini-recovery as only temporary and a result of bargain hunting among private investors. </p> <p>\"Former retail favourites are being bought back by the bigger fools' younger brothers,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Technology stocks returned to favour with a vengeance yesterday as heavy buying by investors out to recoup losses suffered in recent weeks prompted a 8% jump in the Techmark 100 index. By the close of trading, the technology-driven index had completed its sixth rise in consecutive days to end up 272.9 points at 3634.95, well off recent a lows of 2925 points. The benchmark FTSE 100 closed up 155.9 points at 6626.4, helped by strong performances from mobile phone company Vodafone AirTouch, handheld computer expert Psion and software group Baltimore Technologies. The London market was also helped by a strong early per formance from the US Nasdaq index which was up 5% at 3694.8 at lunchtime. Traders there were buoyed by receding fears of interest rate rises and figures showing a slight rise in unemployment, indicating the Federal Reserve's attempts to keep a lid on the booming economy were succeeding. On the European mainland Italian internet service provider Tiscali added 6%, while Spain's Terra Networks put on 4%. Dealers said they hoped the rally was evidence that the sell-off had bottomed out although they warned that even some of the day's strongest performers remain valued at less than a third of the highs they reached in early March. Among the strongest per formers were NetBenefit which jumped 50% to 562.5p, Geo Interactive which climbed 34% to 870p and Redstone Telecom up 33% at 327.5p. However, all three shares are still trading at less than a third of their levels of two months ago. \"The quality stocks had been tarred with the same brush as those of lower quality and the selling had gone too far,\" one dealer said. \"The quality plays are now returning to sensible levels.\" Spencer Crooks, a director at stockbroker Winterflood Securities, said: \"We've gone from one extreme to another. Everything was too high in March and now it's looking too low. People are showing interest again. The institutions are increasing their weightings and there are fewer distressed sellers out there. The private punter is also coming back into the equation.\" Another dealer said: \"The momentum investors are get ting back on the bandwagon but whether we see the sort of resurgence we saw six months ago remains to be seen.\" Analysts said the increase in volume of shares traded indicated liquidity was returning to the market. Around 15m Freeserve shares changed hands, with QXL.com rising 20p to 140p on volume of 9.6m. News of an agreement with the Microsoft-backed travel site Expedia prompted renewed interest in Lastminute.com. More than 1m shares changed hands as the price rose 21p to 152.5p. Among the bulletin board favourites, Eidos climbed 75p to 380p on the back of unconfirmed rumours of a deal to design games for Nokia Wap phones, while Durlacher was 14p better off at 85p. The return to form was greeted with huge enthusiasm on the Hemmington Scott internet bulletin board. \"YeeeeeeeeeeeeeeHHHaaaaaaa!!!!!!\" said Gambo55. \"Ages since we had a good Yeeeha on the BB,\" replied HectorP. \"Vol. on Naz looks very impressive ... looks like we're in for a long rally. Have a good w/e,\" added Bullish. However, Miles Saltiel, technology analyst at West LB Panmure, urged caution and said he regarded the mini-recovery as only temporary and a result of bargain hunting among private investors. \"Former retail favourites are being bought back by the bigger fools' younger brothers,\" he said.",

One or two analysts recently suggested payouts could be as low as \u00a3350-\u00a3400 as a result of the banking sector having plunged in value on the stock market during the last few months. </p> <p>B&amp;B said this week that every eligible member will receive 250 shares worth an estimated \u00a32.59 to \u00a33.26 each, which works out at a total of \u00a3647-\u00a3815. If one takes the mid-point of this price range, that would mean payouts worth \u00a3731. </p> <p>It was in April last year that B&amp;B members voted by 62% to 38% in favour of carpetbagging plumber Stephen Major's proposal that it float on the stock market and pay windfalls that he claimed would average \u00a32,000 (how wrong he was... ) </p> <p>The result was a terrible blow to the society's board, which had urged members to vote for it to stay a mutual (member-owned), warning them: \"If we turned into a bank, our first priority would change from serving members to maximising profits.\" </p> <p>That was then, this is now - B&amp;B's bosses this week painted a glowing picture of its future as a \"pro-consumer plc\" and insisted that little about the way it deals with its customers would change as a result of conversion. </p> <p>For the change of status to go ahead, members will have to approve the plans. Voting packs, which include the 140-page \"transfer document\" giving full details of the proposal and the voting form, start going out to members from this Monday. </p> <p>Here we answer some of the questions policyholders are likely to have. </p> <p><strong> So what happens now?</strong> </p> <p>B&amp;B is urging members to use their vote. As well as allowing people to vote by post, it is holding a special general meeting at Sheffield Arena on July 17 where they can have their say in person. The result of the ballot will be announced at the end of the meeting. Those voting by post must get their forms back to the scrutineers by midnight on July 12. </p> <p>For conversion to go ahead, 51% or more of B&amp;B's borrowers and at least 75% of savers must vote in favour (and at least half of its savers must take part in the vote). </p> <p>Provided this happens - and, based on past experience, it almost certainly will - B&amp;B will float on the stock market on December 4. A facility will be put in place to allow people to sell shares if they wish. </p> <p><strong> Hang on, the vote took place last year. Why does there have to be another one?</strong> </p> <p>Last year's vote wasn't a proper conversion ballot - it was more of an opinion poll. By law, there now has to be a formal vote on the proposal that B&amp;B becomes a bank. \"Each and every vote is important. A large turnout and a positive vote is required if we are to proceed with conversion,\" says chairman Lindsay Mackinlay. </p> <p><strong> How do I know if I'm eligible for a windfall?</strong> </p> <p>In order to qualify for a payout, a saver must have had at least \u00a3100 in their account(s) on two dates - April 25, 1999 and May 21, 2000 - and must also have held their account(s) continuously between the first of those dates and December 3, 2000. Borrowers need to have had a B&amp;B mortgage on April 25, 1999 and must also hold one with the society on December 3, 2000. </p> <p><strong> I'm a B&amp;B saver and I also have my mortgage with them. Do I get two lots of shares?</strong> </p> <p>Yes. </p> <p><strong> My son has a KidZone children's account. Will he get a windfall?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, provided he meets the eligibility criteria applying to adults. While many past flotations excluded kids from windfalls, B&amp;B is awarding full payouts to 129,000 children, including for the first time 96,000 youngsters whose accounts are in the names of trustees (usually their parents). </p> <p><strong> My husband opened a B&amp;B account in 1995 and died in December last year. I've inherited the account. What's my position ?</strong> </p> <p>Again, provided the minimum balance requirements are met, you'll be entitled to receive the same size windfall your late husband would have got had he been alive at the time of conversion. You'll need to formally notify the society of your husband's death, if you haven't already done so. </p> <p><strong> My mother is in a nursing home and has a B&amp;B account, though it is operated by a nurse there. What happens with her?</strong> </p> <p>Around 10,000 trustee account holders for elderly, ill and disabled people will get payouts under B&amp;B's conversion plans. Legislation was introduced in 1997 to protect the rights of those who rely on others such as carers to operate their accounts. Now, a nurse in a care home operating accounts on behalf of seven mentally disabled residents would get seven payouts, plus one for herself as well if she has her own qualifying account. Under the old system, she would have only got one payout because she was the first-named on the accounts. </p> <p><strong> I've read in the past that mortgage-holders have a lot more to lose from conversion than savers. Is that true?</strong> </p> <p>Yes. B&amp;B has already warned that if it becomes a bank, \"we would have to raise mortgage rates\". Building societies typically charge variable rate borrowers up to 0.5% less than banks. For example, Nationwide's standard variable mortgage rate is 7.29% while the Halifax's is 7.74%. On a \u00a360,000 interest-only mortgage that adds up to an annual saving for the Nationwide borrower of \u00a3270. These figuresshow that many borrowers windfalls could be cancelled out by higher mortgage costs. </p> <p><strong> To find out more</strong></p> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley's conversion helpline, 0845 601 1456, is open 8am-8pm Mon-Fri, 9am-noon Sat.

But a closer look at the data reveals that the north-south divide in property prices is wider than ever, making such averages increasingly meaningless. </p> <p>In Greater London, for example, the average price-tag is now \u00a3163,317 - 23% up on a year ago, when it was \u00a3132,570. This annual rate of house price growth is more than four times that experienced by the north of England, where property values rose only 5% over the same period. There, the average home sells for \u00a359,343. </p> <p>The figures from the Land Registry, a government department (<a href=\"http://www.landreg.gov.uk\">www.landreg.gov.uk</a>), compare prices in the first three months of this year with the same period last year. They are generally regarded as providing the most accurate picture of the state of the housing market because they are based on the vast majority of all house sales. </p> <p>One revelation is that, contrary to what many might have imagined, London is no longer leading the way in terms of house price growth. Prices are rising faster than anywhere else in the genteel Georgian spa town of Bath, where a typical property will now set you back \u00a3130,470 - a whopping 38% up on a year ago, when the figure was \u00a394,028. </p> <p>Meanwhile, two southern seaside towns, Brighton and Bournemouth, are basking in the glow of annual price growth of 27% and 25% respectively. Average property prices there are \u00a3106,169 and \u00a398,000 respectively. Reading is another star performer, with prices there up 26% over the year, and several other locations are giving London a run for its money including Surrey, the town of Poole and Windsor and Maidenhead. </p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, six areas saw property prices fall over the past year: Carmarthenshire, Kingston-upon-Hull, Darlington, north-east Lincolnshire, Rutland and Warrington. </p> <p>London figures provide further evidence that the housing boom has filtered through to traditionally less lusted-after areas. In the borough of Newham prices have surged 38% in a year (from \u00a363,689 to \u00a387,777) and in Southwark the increase was 32% (from \u00a3121,574 to \u00a3160,477). </p> <p>But anyone who thought that London's most desirable locations might be calming down after the huge price increases of the last couple of years is in for a surprise. Buried deep within the Land Registry's 20-page report is a remarkable statistic: the average terraced house in Kensington and Chelsea now costs \u00a31,153,000. That's more than double what you'd have paid a year ago. </p> <p>So it's no surprise to learn that of the 237 houses sold for more than \u00a31m in Greater London between January and March this year, 101 are in Kensington and Chelsea. Westminster comes in second place on the rich list with 62 \u00a31m-plus properties. </p> <p>It's no wonder so many people believe the property boom has driven prices up to unrealistic levels. Research out this week reveals that 45% of all homeowners think houses in their area are overvalued. This figure rises to 63% in London and the south. </p> <p>The survey was conducted by NOP for online estate agent asserta home, which has nearly 150 properties on its website (<a href=\"http://www.assertahome.com\">www.assertahome.com</a>) valued at more than \u00a32m. \"City bonuses and dot.com windfalls are undoubtedly fuelling the buoyant nature of the top end of the market,\" says an asserta home spokesman. The phenomenon has led to some streets in London being made up entirely of \u00a31m-plus homes. </p> <p>It all begs the question: how long can the boom carry on? Well, figures out this week from Nationwide building society back up suggestions from other commentators that the market is beginning to run out of steam. It says that house prices fell 0.4% in May - the first monthly fall for almost two years - on the back of recent stock market jitters, fears of higher interest rates and the April abolition of Miras (mortgage interest tax relief). </p> <p>With the economy in good shape, there is little to suggest the housing market is heading for a slump, says the Nationwide. But it adds: \"Compared with the start of the year, recent economic growth is moderately slower, the number of houses being sold is lower and consumers are feeling less confident.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>The other morning an Arsenal fan rang Radio 5 Live's daily phone-in. He said he had been one of the supporters hurling chairs in the square in Copenhagen on the afternoon of the Uefa Cup final. He added: \"I'm not a hooligan. I've never been involved in violence before. But if someone picks up a chair and threatens you, what are you going to do? Stand there? Put your hands over your face? Run away? You're going to chuck one back, aren't you?\"</p> <p>Another supporter, who'd also been in the square, rang in a few moments later and agreed: \"Who's to say that if Barry [let's call him Barry] hadn't picked up a chair, would we even be talking to him now? Or would Barry be lying in hospital with stab wounds ... or worse?\".</p> <p>So is Barry a football hooligan? Of all the subjects we discuss on 5 Live phone-ins (and we're talking expertise here, because we do a lot) football violence always, always elicits the greatest response. Because still no one has been able to say why it happens. And it will continue to be a big talking point up to and during Euro 2000.</p> <p>A few years ago I thought I'd worked it out. It was troublemakers who went there deliberately to start the trouble. This, combined with England's reputation, which always brings out the worst in the opposition supporters, and a lot more English fans on the periphery who joined in because they were drunk, was the cause. If you wanted to avoid the trouble, you could.</p> <p>I went to Rotterdam, for example, for the \"do I not like that\" international between England and Holland. I went as a fan, travelling with friends by ferry and car to the game. There was trouble at the railway station and in the main square. Where you'd expect it to be. We stayed out of those areas. We were fine. There were no real problems getting to the stadium, apart from the usual snarling police dogs, but if you kept your distance, you were OK.</p> <p>When Ronald Koeman scored (he shouldn't even have been on the pitch after a professional foul earlier), we, in the England penned area, were assaulted by a couple of flares that were thrown at us. But a few neat sidesteps and we were just dandy, thanks. Most England fans ignored the taunting and afterwards we made our way home. No trouble.</p> <p>When we got home the TV, radio and papers were full of \"England violence\" stories. Then there were the more hysterical columnists (as they were still doing after the Copenhagen trouble, incidentally) suggesting that England withdraw from various championships and qualifiers, and give up World Cup bids etc. Whatever. All that mattered was that I'd solved it. If you wanted to avoid trouble, you could. It was the people who wanted trouble who found it.</p> <p>But now I'm not so sure. The more you hear about it, the more each case seems to be different. At Marseille during the World Cup it happened before and during the match as people watched on the beach. According to colleagues, it definitely wasn't planned. In Turkey the night before the Uefa Cup semi-final, many innocent Leeds fans who had never been involved in anything before were caught up in it.</p> <p>So what do we do about Euro 2000? Not go? Ban booze for all England games? (Surely they must). Segregate the Turks and the English? What about the German fans or the Dutch? </p> <p>If you were going to predict trouble, you'd do it for this tournament, wouldn't you? All the elements seem to be there. And will local police really go on strike? Maybe the solution is for everyone to visit an Amsterdam coffee shop in the build-up to the matches.</p> <p>Like many reporters I used to think the trouble was caused entirely by yobbos who seemed to enjoy violence. But I can't get Barry out of my mind.</p>",

When Ronald Koeman scored (he shouldn't even have been on the pitch after a professional foul earlier), we, in the England penned area, were assaulted by a couple of flares that were thrown at us. But a few neat sidesteps and we were just dandy, thanks. Most England fans ignored the taunting and afterwards we made our way home. No trouble. When we got home the TV, radio and papers were full of \"England violence\" stories. Then there were the more hysterical columnists (as they were still doing after the Copenhagen trouble, incidentally) suggesting that England withdraw from various championships and qualifiers, and give up World Cup bids etc. Whatever. All that mattered was that I'd solved it. If you wanted to avoid trouble, you could. It was the people who wanted trouble who found it. But now I'm not so sure. The more you hear about it, the more each case seems to be different. At Marseille during the World Cup it happened before and during the match as people watched on the beach. According to colleagues, it definitely wasn't planned. In Turkey the night before the Uefa Cup semi-final, many innocent Leeds fans who had never been involved in anything before were caught up in it. So what do we do about Euro 2000? Not go? Ban booze for all England games? (Surely they must). Segregate the Turks and the English? What about the German fans or the Dutch? If you were going to predict trouble, you'd do it for this tournament, wouldn't you? All the elements seem to be there. And will local police really go on strike? Maybe the solution is for everyone to visit an Amsterdam coffee shop in the build-up to the matches. Like many reporters I used to think the trouble was caused entirely by yobbos who seemed to enjoy violence. But I can't get Barry out of my mind.",

      "body": "<p>Batsmen came and went all day, 16 in all, in melancholy procession. Their expressions conveyed disbelief, puzzlement or exasperation at the seemingly turgid vagaries of the pitch. They might also have revealed self-rebuke. Too few came to terms with what they argued was an often inanimate festival track that still managed to be capricious. </p> <p>Occasionally from the railway end, one heard a train on its way to Charing Cross. This suggested a sense of purpose never enacted by a long line of batsmen who appeared at times immobilised by neurosis. Stroke-making looked impractical; Durham, for instance, summoned up just four well-spaced boundaries. </p> <p>Perhaps much of the huffing was justified. But would not a despairing spirit of adventure have made sense? Grim defending of the stumps proved contagious. John Wood (five for 36), emerged from near the bottom of the order only to insist on playing like a somnolent opener, pledged to save the game on the last day. He took 48 balls to score and almost at once, as if overcome by such wanton exertions, was one of the day's many lbw victims. </p> <p>There were still aspects to applaud. In only his fourth first-class match David Masters took six for 27 for Kent. Four came off 10 overs during which he gave away nine runs. </p> <p>His team-mates made the ritual way for him at the end of the Durham innings and Masters's shy, though joyful, reaction offered a moment to cherish on a day mostly devoid of them. The young seamer's father, Kevin, was also a Kent fast bowler; cricketing continuity on yesterday's evidence is in good hands. </p> <p>Earlier Matthew Fleming, so resolute the previous day, added only two more runs and Kent were all out for 177. Durham's innings extended to 64 overs, a reflection on the disinclination to challenge the conditions. Nicky Peng, the least experienced of the batsmen, looked the likeliest to succeed. Simon Katich went to a slower ball, Martin Speight to a diving catch by Matthew Fleming at extra cover. </p> <p>Kent's absence of established seam bowlers this season has brought its own bonuses, Martin Saggers finding some aggression against his former county. There were a few attacking shots as Kent batted again after some more scoreboard paralysis. </p> <p>Matthew Walker was most alert; Ed Smith stayed for 33 balls before being dismissed without a run. Kent are 141 ahead and within the context of the strange batsmen's hypnosis, it may be enough.</p>",

But would not a despairing spirit of adventure have made sense? Grim defending of the stumps proved contagious. John Wood (five for 36), emerged from near the bottom of the order only to insist on playing like a somnolent opener, pledged to save the game on the last day. He took 48 balls to score and almost at once, as if overcome by such wanton exertions, was one of the day's many lbw victims. There were still aspects to applaud. In only his fourth first-class match David Masters took six for 27 for Kent. Four came off 10 overs during which he gave away nine runs. His team-mates made the ritual way for him at the end of the Durham innings and Masters's shy, though joyful, reaction offered a moment to cherish on a day mostly devoid of them. The young seamer's father, Kevin, was also a Kent fast bowler; cricketing continuity on yesterday's evidence is in good hands. Earlier Matthew Fleming, so resolute the previous day, added only two more runs and Kent were all out for 177. Durham's innings extended to 64 overs, a reflection on the disinclination to challenge the conditions. Nicky Peng, the least experienced of the batsmen, looked the likeliest to succeed. Simon Katich went to a slower ball, Martin Speight to a diving catch by Matthew Fleming at extra cover. Kent's absence of established seam bowlers this season has brought its own bonuses, Martin Saggers finding some aggression against his former county. There were a few attacking shots as Kent batted again after some more scoreboard paralysis. Matthew Walker was most alert; Ed Smith stayed for 33 balls before being dismissed without a run. Kent are 141 ahead and within the context of the strange batsmen's hypnosis, it may be enough.",

It is the West Indies series that will judge Ramprakash's Test credentials, just as West Indies series have reflected his progress throughout his career. In his debut summer, in 1991, he was the maker of dogged 20s; four years later a pair at Lord's symbolised a career in abeyance; and, most memorably, it was his 154 in Bridgetown three winters ago that brought hopes that he had reached fulfillment. Zimbabwe should not be rubbished. But there were times when they resembled a decent club attack. They even benefited from the club bowler's favourite weapon - as play was frequently halted for people moving behind the arm. Zimbabwe's players wore armbands in memory of Tony Oates, the fifth farmer to die since squatters occupied white-run farms. His son, Jason, toured England with Zimbabwe's Under-19 side last summer. By such standards, worrying about Mark Ramprakash is pointless. He is old enough and good enough to be left to get on with it.",

      "body": "<p><strong>HASSEL OVER</strong></p> <p>Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink today finally brought an end to the laziest transfer story in recent years when he roused himself out of his armchair, put on his dressing gown and ambled to central London to sign a six-year contract with fashionable-again West London boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea. Dutch international Jimmy, with a soothing mug of hot chocolate in his hand, met the press and said: \"It's a very big move and I feel happy with it. I hope to get as high as possible.\"</p> <p>High in terms of league position, you understand. Although no-one would deny the man who scored half of Atletico's goals last season a celebratory 'cocktail' on his return to the league he loves so much. \"I had two great years at Leeds and I love that club,\" said the man who walked out on them last summer. \"When I left Leeds I had an offer from Chelsea. I wanted to come here but they didn't want to let me go to another English club. So I had to leave to Atletico.\"</p> <p>But now Jimmy has got his all-time dream move of all time. And a small matter of a contract believed to be worth around \u00a360k-a-week. This means that Chris Sutton is likely get 60 reminders a week to sling his hook, and Gianfranco Zola will probably have to pack up his bag of tricks and hitch his way back to Italy. George Weah's loan is also up and Tore Andre Flo could leave for Leeds. But as far as Jimmy is concerned: \"It's a strong squad at Chelsea with a lot of players.\" Stay off the yoghurts Jimmy, that would be our advice.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>EURO COUNTDOWN: THREE DAYS TO GO</strong></p> <p>The Euro, the Fiver's extra low-down from the lowlands, brought to you in association with breathe, starts on Monday.

Dennis Wise had been bundled into a swimming-pool sized locker for the fourth successive away trip, while Robbie Fowler was busy in the toilet, eagerly preparing to open up the Saturday night festivities by dropping hundreds of water-filled condoms all over Derek Fazackerley. A traditional boring nil-nil draw in tomorrow's match and England would be set up perfectly for Euro 2000.</p> <p>But then Kelvin Koogan strolled in and ripped apart weeks of intricate planning for the biggest booze-fest in Valletta since Napoleon's troops passed through in 1798. \"There is no way my players will be taking it easy in this match,\" Koogan promised the press - prompting astonished looks from his squad, who thought that was the whole idea. \"I promise it will not be like a testimonial and if players perform as if it is then they will be replaced. We have to look at this as another game where we can learn a lot about ourselves.\" </p> <p>And to prove his point, Koogan then named a side close to his first eleven. Nick Barmby, Kevin Phillips and Richard Wright have been given the opportunity to prove themselves, but Koogan is taking the match as seriously as any other. \"Football is a competitive game and we will be going in to win the ball,\" he said, when asked about his tactics for tomorrow's game. Not bad when you think the Maltese are known for being a tough-tackling side. Actually, let's dispense with the journalese - they're hackers.</p> <p>England team: Wright, G Neville, P Neville, Campbell, Keown, Wise, Beckham, Scholes, Barmby, Shearer, Phillips.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I have put the idea into a safe and I have lost the combination to that safe. Let it stay there in peace\" - Sepp Blatter has abandoned the idea of a World Cup every two years. At least until he finds a safe-cracker.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>DOUBLE TROUBLE</strong></p> <p>Now that Celtic have made Martin O'Neill their manager, what is poor old caretaker boss Kenny Dalglish going to do? Well, obviously he's going to play a lot golf. A hell of a lot. But what about in-between rounds, will he just hang around Parkhead and get in the way?</p> <p>\"From my own point of view, that's my spell as interim manager over now,\" began Kenny as he obstructed an agitated Irish bloke with some important business to attend to in the corridor. \"I'll be moving back to my original position,\" the Director of Football continued, ordering an impatient curly-haired chap to carry his clubs to his car. As he sped off for the sanctuary of the Old Course, he was heard to shout: \"I hope Martin's time at the club is very successful.\"</p> <p>So it looks like everything's back to normal at Celtic. But what of poor old left-behind Leicester? Fans still reeling from O'Neill's departure were served another body blow today when Steve Walsh revealed he would put himself and Tony Cottee forward as a management dream ticket. \"When a manager departs it doesn't always benefit the club to bring in a new face,\" explained Walsh, reading verbatim from 'Manage This, Relegate That', the best-selling self-help guide by top executive guru David Platt.</p> <p>\"I believe that myself and Tony are as capable as anyone of keeping this team together and on the road Martin has put us on,\" the stalwart defender said, almost believing it himself. \"I will be confirming my intention as soon as possible to the chairman of my and Tony's intention to apply for the roles of manager and assistant manager.\" Ah well, it was good while it lasted.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Leeds are interested in signing Lee Hendrie from Aston Villa. \"I've heard a few things about it\", the \u00a35m-rated midfielder said today. \"I don't know for sure what's happening because I've been away from home and I'm not too sure how far it has gone. I will have to see what the manager says first.\"</p> <p>Southampton, West Ham and Coventry are scrapping it out to bring another Moroccan international to the Premiership. All three clubs want to sign central defender Abdullah Saber from Sporting Lisbon, although the lure of Big Cup football (Sporting are Portuguese champions) could be enough to keep him at the club.</p> <p>Middlesbrough are reported to have agreed terms with Christian Karembeu over his proposed move to the Riverside. The transfer could be completed over the weekend. Earlier today a club spokesman confirmed: \"We have declared an interest in the player.\"</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>A top Uefa official has attacked the British government for not banning hooligans from travelling to Euro 2000. Egidius Braun, who is chairman of the organising committee for Euro 2000 and president of the German FA, said: \"The German government are not only taking passports off known hooligans but they will also be obliged to report to the police station every day during the championships. I think it is not the best idea that they are not doing anything in England.\" </p> <p>Darlington will have one league point deducted next season if there is any repeat of the incident in which one of their fans attacked a opposition player. The club pleaded guilty today to a charge of failing to control their spectators towards the end of a Third Division match with Shrewsbury on April 5.</p> <p>Bradford will play either Turkish side Kocaelispor or FK Atlantas of Lithuania in the second round of the Intertoto Cup.</p> <p>Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids is recovering quickly from an ingrowing toenail and should be fit to play in Holland's opening Euro 2000 match.</p> <p>Barcelona's Brazilian forward Rivaldo has pledged his future to the club - if they decide they want to keep him. Lazio were reported to be leading the chase for a player valued at around $50 million but Rivaldo insisted: \"If Barcelona want me in the team then I'll stay.\" </p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>History Channel: The Tsar's Faberge Eggs (7pm)</p> <p>No football at all on television or radio tonight.

      "bodyText": "HASSEL OVER Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink today finally brought an end to the laziest transfer story in recent years when he roused himself out of his armchair, put on his dressing gown and ambled to central London to sign a six-year contract with fashionable-again West London boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea. Dutch international Jimmy, with a soothing mug of hot chocolate in his hand, met the press and said: \"It's a very big move and I feel happy with it. I hope to get as high as possible.\" High in terms of league position, you understand. Although no-one would deny the man who scored half of Atletico's goals last season a celebratory 'cocktail' on his return to the league he loves so much. \"I had two great years at Leeds and I love that club,\" said the man who walked out on them last summer. \"When I left Leeds I had an offer from Chelsea. I wanted to come here but they didn't want to let me go to another English club. So I had to leave to Atletico.\" But now Jimmy has got his all-time dream move of all time. And a small matter of a contract believed to be worth around \u00a360k-a-week. This means that Chris Sutton is likely get 60 reminders a week to sling his hook, and Gianfranco Zola will probably have to pack up his bag of tricks and hitch his way back to Italy. George Weah's loan is also up and Tore Andre Flo could leave for Leeds. But as far as Jimmy is concerned: \"It's a strong squad at Chelsea with a lot of players.\" Stay off the yoghurts Jimmy, that would be our advice. * * * * * * * * * * * * * EURO COUNTDOWN: THREE DAYS TO GO The Euro, the Fiver's extra low-down from the lowlands, brought to you in association with breathe, starts on Monday.

Dennis Wise had been bundled into a swimming-pool sized locker for the fourth successive away trip, while Robbie Fowler was busy in the toilet, eagerly preparing to open up the Saturday night festivities by dropping hundreds of water-filled condoms all over Derek Fazackerley. A traditional boring nil-nil draw in tomorrow's match and England would be set up perfectly for Euro 2000. But then Kelvin Koogan strolled in and ripped apart weeks of intricate planning for the biggest booze-fest in Valletta since Napoleon's troops passed through in 1798. \"There is no way my players will be taking it easy in this match,\" Koogan promised the press - prompting astonished looks from his squad, who thought that was the whole idea. \"I promise it will not be like a testimonial and if players perform as if it is then they will be replaced. We have to look at this as another game where we can learn a lot about ourselves.\" And to prove his point, Koogan then named a side close to his first eleven. Nick Barmby, Kevin Phillips and Richard Wright have been given the opportunity to prove themselves, but Koogan is taking the match as seriously as any other. \"Football is a competitive game and we will be going in to win the ball,\" he said, when asked about his tactics for tomorrow's game. Not bad when you think the Maltese are known for being a tough-tackling side. Actually, let's dispense with the journalese - they're hackers. England team: Wright, G Neville, P Neville, Campbell, Keown, Wise, Beckham, Scholes, Barmby, Shearer, Phillips. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I have put the idea into a safe and I have lost the combination to that safe. Let it stay there in peace\" - Sepp Blatter has abandoned the idea of a World Cup every two years. At least until he finds a safe-cracker. * * * * * * * * * * * * * DOUBLE TROUBLE Now that Celtic have made Martin O'Neill their manager, what is poor old caretaker boss Kenny Dalglish going to do? Well, obviously he's going to play a lot golf. A hell of a lot. But what about in-between rounds, will he just hang around Parkhead and get in the way? \"From my own point of view, that's my spell as interim manager over now,\" began Kenny as he obstructed an agitated Irish bloke with some important business to attend to in the corridor. \"I'll be moving back to my original position,\" the Director of Football continued, ordering an impatient curly-haired chap to carry his clubs to his car. As he sped off for the sanctuary of the Old Course, he was heard to shout: \"I hope Martin's time at the club is very successful.\" So it looks like everything's back to normal at Celtic. But what of poor old left-behind Leicester? Fans still reeling from O'Neill's departure were served another body blow today when Steve Walsh revealed he would put himself and Tony Cottee forward as a management dream ticket. \"When a manager departs it doesn't always benefit the club to bring in a new face,\" explained Walsh, reading verbatim from 'Manage This, Relegate That', the best-selling self-help guide by top executive guru David Platt. \"I believe that myself and Tony are as capable as anyone of keeping this team together and on the road Martin has put us on,\" the stalwart defender said, almost believing it himself. \"I will be confirming my intention as soon as possible to the chairman of my and Tony's intention to apply for the roles of manager and assistant manager.\" Ah well, it was good while it lasted. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Leeds are interested in signing Lee Hendrie from Aston Villa. \"I've heard a few things about it\", the \u00a35m-rated midfielder said today. \"I don't know for sure what's happening because I've been away from home and I'm not too sure how far it has gone. I will have to see what the manager says first.\" Southampton, West Ham and Coventry are scrapping it out to bring another Moroccan international to the Premiership. All three clubs want to sign central defender Abdullah Saber from Sporting Lisbon, although the lure of Big Cup football (Sporting are Portuguese champions) could be enough to keep him at the club. Middlesbrough are reported to have agreed terms with Christian Karembeu over his proposed move to the Riverside. The transfer could be completed over the weekend. Earlier today a club spokesman confirmed: \"We have declared an interest in the player.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF A top Uefa official has attacked the British government for not banning hooligans from travelling to Euro 2000. Egidius Braun, who is chairman of the organising committee for Euro 2000 and president of the German FA, said: \"The German government are not only taking passports off known hooligans but they will also be obliged to report to the police station every day during the championships. I think it is not the best idea that they are not doing anything in England.\" Darlington will have one league point deducted next season if there is any repeat of the incident in which one of their fans attacked a opposition player. The club pleaded guilty today to a charge of failing to control their spectators towards the end of a Third Division match with Shrewsbury on April 5. Bradford will play either Turkish side Kocaelispor or FK Atlantas of Lithuania in the second round of the Intertoto Cup. Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids is recovering quickly from an ingrowing toenail and should be fit to play in Holland's opening Euro 2000 match. Barcelona's Brazilian forward Rivaldo has pledged his future to the club - if they decide they want to keep him. Lazio were reported to be leading the chase for a player valued at around $50 million but Rivaldo insisted: \"If Barcelona want me in the team then I'll stay.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO History Channel: The Tsar's Faberge Eggs (7pm) No football at all on television or radio tonight.

But it is not the water's French heritage that makes it so desirable, nor the fact that it undergoes 350 quality checks each day to guarantee purity and taste. It's the high level of calcium - 729mg per bottle, about the same as three glasses of milk - that gives it the edge. Launched yesterday to coincide with the first day of National Osteoporosis Month, Contrex is the perfect tipple for anyone needing a calcium top-up, such as pregnant women, adolescents and those with dairy intolerances. While nobody is advocating that water should replace food as a source of minerals, it's still important that we drink plenty of it every day. Fact-lovers, did you know that even a 3% loss in total body-water will cause fatigue, while a 10% loss is life-threatening? Our only quarrel with Contrex is: must it really retail at \u00a31.09 for 1.5 litres? Bottled water already costs silly money. Can someone have a word?",

Just let me book a quick St Tropez tanning session first.\" </p> <p>Whatever possessed the habitually demure, sophisticated actress Joely Richardson - more commonly seen in crisp Calvin Klein white shirt and Joseph trousers - to don a strappy, plunge-neck, backless minidress festooned with golden fringes? True, the event in question - the royal premiere of the film Maybe Baby, written and directed by Ben Elton - was suitably grand and high profile. But a simple black velvet number would have done. Something tasteful from Prada, perhaps? Richardson's dress, which hailed from the fantastical imagination of Welsh designer Julien MacDonald, wouldn't have looked out of place in the Spice Girls' tour wardrobe. Indeed, Posh wore a similar MacDonald creation to the British Fashion Awards in February. She, too, got a lot of publicity for it. </p> <p>Joely Richardson looked stunning. Tall, blonde, tanned and buffed, she was a golden goddess, her lithe legs made longer by the addition of strappy three-inch heels (in gold, of course). If you've got a body like that, why not flaunt it? With her Model Looks, Richardson would have made the papers whatever she'd worn. But only by upping the ante and exposing Ibizan levels of flesh did she stand a chance of bagging the front pages of the Mail, Mirror and Telegraph - plus gratuitous footage on TV. </p> <p>Dressing for special occasions is difficult. Women, unlike men, can't just don a smart tie and hope for the best. Women must take into account current fashions, the type of occasion, the level of their self-esteem on said night. If they have a tan, they might just show their legs. If they've lost weight recently, a glimpse of midriff might feel acceptable. </p> <p>For models and actresses, the stakes are even higher. These women are paid to look good and command attention. Every social event is fraught with sartorial danger. What if they pick the wrong dress? Wrong colour? Wrong style? What if - horror of horrors - they have a Celine Dion Moment? </p> <p>Little wonder flesh so often prevails over common sense and decency because one thing is for sure: exposing your skin will get cameras clicking, tongues rolling and lips licking. Liz Hurley knows it: she and Versace have made thousands out of her creamy taut flesh. Princess Diana knew it: post-Charles, her first public outing was in a figure-hugging creation with a risqu\u00e9 d\u00e9colletage. How many newly-single women have resorted to the same trick? It works every time: the misty stares of men act as an instant, meaningless ego-boost. </p> <p> Of course, these days we are somewhat inured to the shock value/sex appeal of flesh. Even the cleavage has lost its erotic appeal in the face of so many wholly exposed breasts. When, in 1991, Transvision Vamp frontwoman Wendy James graced the cover of The Face wearing nothing but two diamant\u00e9 nipple studs, it was considered outrageous. Fast forward 10 years and suddenly it's OK to be seen in public with your tits out. Recent examples: rapper Lil Kim exposing one breast at the VH1 awards, Jennifer Lopez flaunting breastbone and bosom in a sheer Versace dress and Meg Mathews' nipple poking through a slashed Galliano evening gown. </p> <p>Consequently, women have had to look for new erogenous zones with which to gain attention. Though a great favourite with designers this season, the breastbone hasn't caught on with Real Women - not surprising, since you need the tits of a 12-year- old to carry it off. Far more popular is the backless dress, as sported by everyone from Mariah Carey to EastEnders' Tamasin Outhwaite and Barbara Windsor. The bare back is a great bet for older women as backs often age better than other parts of the body. Bare backs look sexy without being try-hard or tarty. Carol Vorderman, 39, stunned onlookers at the recent Bafta awards in a plunge-back turquoise dress, her flesh slick with fashionable body glitter. </p> <p>Some celebrities have to go further. Remember Liz Hurley's silver panties? Let's be blunt: Ms Hurley had more than one pair of lips on show. When Vivienne Westwood picked up her OBE in 1992, she exposed her entire \"front bum\" to the world, pulling her skirt up to reveal no pants under sheer tights. Naturally, this made the papers, though as Westwood is slightly less desirable to the average man than Liz Hurley, some of the reports were less than complimentary. </p> <p>And there's the rub. It is excellent that these women - of all ages - feel confident enough to bare their flesh when the occasion suits. For what's more feel-good than slipping on a dress that empowers you and sailing off into the night? Joely Richardson knew her dress would get her column inches, sure. She also knew that men would admire her in it. </p> <p>But woe betide the less firm of flesh if they stick their wrinkly paps above the parapet. The sad reality is that saggy bums and flabby tums will not increase your status, even if they are swathed in Versace.

      "body": "<p>When clubland entrepreneur Oliver Peyton opened the Atlantic Bar and Grill in 1994, a generation of fashion-conscious late twenty- and thirtysomethings regarded him as the drinking man's Moses. They thought he had come to lead them out of the slavery of the pub into the promised land of Manhattan-style bars, with their elaborate interior designs, cocktails and properly-served drinks, decent food and grown-up hours. Of course the posing rump moaned about everyone being pretentious, but they still went there, and looked upon Oliver's promised land and saw that it was good and believed - even if they did mutter that they preferred old blokes pubs, actually. </p> <p>Peyton was not the first to attempt such a thing in London; several smaller fashionable restaurants and hip, late bars had opened in the months before the Atlantic, as three socio-economic factors coalesced. Thatcher's Beer Acts had forced breweries to release licensed properties on to the market at low prices; Martini was launching an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at re-promoting the cocktail against lagers; and the increasingly heavy use of Ecstasy in clubs was, says Peyton, alienating many of his generation. What the Atlantic's huge queues demonstrated was the scale of demand for such venues, and it gave momentum to a trend that brought the phrase \"style bar\" into today's night life lexicon. The question now is how many bars the market can sustain; smart, upmarket bars rely on smart, upmarket customers, and the competition to attract them is intensifying. </p> <p>Three new style-conscious bar-restaurants have opened in London in the last month alone; The Purple Bar at Ian Schrager's Sanderson hotel, Smith's of Smithfield on Charterhouse Street, and for(m) (no, that's how they spell it), which is a member's club on Greek Street. Such frenetic activity means that the bar economy now support its own business conferences, with the first, (called, in that arch, modern, monosyllabic way, \"bar\") taking place at the Business Design Centre in Islington, London next week. </p> <p>\"There is still unsatisfied demand for these bars, so they'll keep opening,\" says Simon Difford, the visionary publisher of Class, a \"Magazine of Bar Culture\" that in the last three years has gone from being a trade journal to successful newsstand title. \"They've come about partly because of an economic boom, and the trend of people trading up, looking for better food, homes, holidays and everything. The ultimate trade up in a bar is a cocktail.\" </p> <p>But Peyton adds that there is a problem in that \"London's bar culture is beginning to feel like New York's - famous for 15 minutes. The ones falling by the wayside are the ones with no big idea; the owners start a bar because people say you can make money in them, but they're not interested in running a cool and interesting place. But I think people are learning from the mistakes.\" </p> <p>Of course to make your bar \"a cool and interesting place\" you need the right clientele; no one's going to think they're \"trading up\" if they're surrounded only by besuited and belligerent after-work office gangs. Maintaining the right crowd has become something of a science. According to Debra Bourne, media consultant and event organiser, it's \"a bit like sustaining a relationship, and suffers accordingly - there's the initial chasing, posturing and courting the in-crowd, the early euphoria, a honeymoon period until the inevitable downward spiral of mundanity sets in and then it's a case of pulling out a few new tricks to spice things up. And even then, two out of three marriages break down.\" </p> <p>The story is not always the same - the owners with ideas will find different strategies - but the standard pitfall-laden process usually runs like this: three months before opening, the bar PR contacts figureheads - people who will get other people talking about the venue. Primarily celebrities that the owner fondly imagines will be his long term regulars, these individuals are tempted in with free meals, given membership cards, then cited as regulars in briefings to journalists. Others invited to preview the venue will be society hosts like Fran Cutler and Meg Matthews (who may be unofficially paid to host a night so they can invite their famous and fashionable friends down), artist liaison officers from record labels (so they'll bring their pop star charges in) and successful party promoters (who will be asked to run club nights on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when customers are scarce). </p> <p>The launch party will be handled by a PR firm chosen on the strength of its contacts with cool celebrities, socialites, the influential and the rich. The \"influential\" set is made up of editors, PRs, photographers, fashion editors, promoters, artists and models. The rich - some of whom may be influential too - are fashionable ad agency account managers, film industry executives, financiers, property developers, property agents and the investors. Generally these are the rich who like to think themselves fashionable, the kind who hang out with the demi-monde, and who will flex their platinum credit cards for the privilege. Ironically, the demi-monde will be there chiefly for the free booze and food. The hope is that this lot will stick around, which they will - for about six weeks or until the next bar opens. The posing rump will defect first, complaining that their previous favourite is now \"full of suits\". </p> <p>After about six or eight weeks a few aspirational gangsters and barrow boys will have drifted in by word of mouth, adding what is euphemistically referred to as \"a bit of colour\". The atmosphere will now be at its best, and the challenge is to preserve it; the period between two and three months after opening is crucial, because the bar has been open long enough to get in newspapers and magazines, and for the figureheads to have been heard talking about it. The door manager will now pick selectively from the people who have heard about it through the media, and have come to have a look; their choices will make or break the bar. Who will they pick from? This third-wave will typically include: hyper-trendy Japanese students; City boys trying to impress their dates; middle managers who have heard about it from their boss and have come down to try to impress a potential new one; young women who work in the arts and media, have seen it mentioned in Vogue and have come to look for Robbie Williams. The key is to choose a mix of people who won't bother the celebs and the influentials with star-spotting, and who won't make a fuss if they discover their manager doing cocaine in the toilets. </p> <p>If the door staff get the mix wrong, the remaining original crowd will move on and the bar owner is in difficulty. He or she has invested heavily in the decor and staff and needs to keep the place full. Do they keep their nerve and keep exclusive? Or do you try to keep your bank manager and investors happy, and let the ordinary punters in? If they choose the latter, the next wave will be what one Soho bar manager refers to as the \"Cecil Gee Posses\" - after-work groups of young male office workers in cheap suits. They have an equivalent in the gangs of after-work office girls who will come down too, but the boys are a bigger problem. As individuals they're OK; but the work suits make them feel like brothers in uniform; the strong lager makes them leery; the knowledge that they are in a trendy bar makes them show off. But the real reason they tend to be unwelcome is that they start hassling women. If the women go and don't come back, the atmosphere dies. Young men do not like drinking with each other, and women feel uncomfortable in an overly-masculine environment; this is why the history of club culture is often shaped by promoters attempting to attract cool young women to their nights. The Cecil Gee Posses will start to scare off Third Wavers, though new out-of-towners will keep coming for a look at weekends for a while until the bar's reputation fades. </p> <p>The owner can now a) accept the downward trajectory or b) try to make the best of it by going low-cool and bringing in the kind of celebrities they were striving to avoid 12 months ago; the EastEnders cast (notoriously easy to get to parties), teen-pop acts, and maybe a DJ who had a good reputation a few years ago to do a Thursday night. The DJ will welcome the chance to \"try something a little different\", which generally means playing his old jazz funk records. If that doesn't work, the best bet is to play up the commercial, clubbing element and get more ropey DJs; this will at least bring in the 18 to 25 year olds who inhabit puffa jackets and commercial house clubs and care more about music and drugs than ambience. When they leave - well, that's when it becomes simple. You just close down, re-open under a new name, and start again. Learning from your \"mistakes\", of course.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When clubland entrepreneur Oliver Peyton opened the Atlantic Bar and Grill in 1994, a generation of fashion-conscious late twenty- and thirtysomethings regarded him as the drinking man's Moses. They thought he had come to lead them out of the slavery of the pub into the promised land of Manhattan-style bars, with their elaborate interior designs, cocktails and properly-served drinks, decent food and grown-up hours. Of course the posing rump moaned about everyone being pretentious, but they still went there, and looked upon Oliver's promised land and saw that it was good and believed - even if they did mutter that they preferred old blokes pubs, actually. Peyton was not the first to attempt such a thing in London; several smaller fashionable restaurants and hip, late bars had opened in the months before the Atlantic, as three socio-economic factors coalesced. Thatcher's Beer Acts had forced breweries to release licensed properties on to the market at low prices; Martini was launching an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at re-promoting the cocktail against lagers; and the increasingly heavy use of Ecstasy in clubs was, says Peyton, alienating many of his generation. What the Atlantic's huge queues demonstrated was the scale of demand for such venues, and it gave momentum to a trend that brought the phrase \"style bar\" into today's night life lexicon. The question now is how many bars the market can sustain; smart, upmarket bars rely on smart, upmarket customers, and the competition to attract them is intensifying. Three new style-conscious bar-restaurants have opened in London in the last month alone; The Purple Bar at Ian Schrager's Sanderson hotel, Smith's of Smithfield on Charterhouse Street, and for(m) (no, that's how they spell it), which is a member's club on Greek Street. Such frenetic activity means that the bar economy now support its own business conferences, with the first, (called, in that arch, modern, monosyllabic way, \"bar\") taking place at the Business Design Centre in Islington, London next week. \"There is still unsatisfied demand for these bars, so they'll keep opening,\" says Simon Difford, the visionary publisher of Class, a \"Magazine of Bar Culture\" that in the last three years has gone from being a trade journal to successful newsstand title. \"They've come about partly because of an economic boom, and the trend of people trading up, looking for better food, homes, holidays and everything. The ultimate trade up in a bar is a cocktail.\" But Peyton adds that there is a problem in that \"London's bar culture is beginning to feel like New York's - famous for 15 minutes. The ones falling by the wayside are the ones with no big idea; the owners start a bar because people say you can make money in them, but they're not interested in running a cool and interesting place. But I think people are learning from the mistakes.\" Of course to make your bar \"a cool and interesting place\" you need the right clientele; no one's going to think they're \"trading up\" if they're surrounded only by besuited and belligerent after-work office gangs. Maintaining the right crowd has become something of a science. According to Debra Bourne, media consultant and event organiser, it's \"a bit like sustaining a relationship, and suffers accordingly - there's the initial chasing, posturing and courting the in-crowd, the early euphoria, a honeymoon period until the inevitable downward spiral of mundanity sets in and then it's a case of pulling out a few new tricks to spice things up. And even then, two out of three marriages break down.\" The story is not always the same - the owners with ideas will find different strategies - but the standard pitfall-laden process usually runs like this: three months before opening, the bar PR contacts figureheads - people who will get other people talking about the venue. Primarily celebrities that the owner fondly imagines will be his long term regulars, these individuals are tempted in with free meals, given membership cards, then cited as regulars in briefings to journalists. Others invited to preview the venue will be society hosts like Fran Cutler and Meg Matthews (who may be unofficially paid to host a night so they can invite their famous and fashionable friends down), artist liaison officers from record labels (so they'll bring their pop star charges in) and successful party promoters (who will be asked to run club nights on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when customers are scarce). The launch party will be handled by a PR firm chosen on the strength of its contacts with cool celebrities, socialites, the influential and the rich. The \"influential\" set is made up of editors, PRs, photographers, fashion editors, promoters, artists and models. The rich - some of whom may be influential too - are fashionable ad agency account managers, film industry executives, financiers, property developers, property agents and the investors. Generally these are the rich who like to think themselves fashionable, the kind who hang out with the demi-monde, and who will flex their platinum credit cards for the privilege. Ironically, the demi-monde will be there chiefly for the free booze and food. The hope is that this lot will stick around, which they will - for about six weeks or until the next bar opens. The posing rump will defect first, complaining that their previous favourite is now \"full of suits\". After about six or eight weeks a few aspirational gangsters and barrow boys will have drifted in by word of mouth, adding what is euphemistically referred to as \"a bit of colour\". The atmosphere will now be at its best, and the challenge is to preserve it; the period between two and three months after opening is crucial, because the bar has been open long enough to get in newspapers and magazines, and for the figureheads to have been heard talking about it. The door manager will now pick selectively from the people who have heard about it through the media, and have come to have a look; their choices will make or break the bar. Who will they pick from? This third-wave will typically include: hyper-trendy Japanese students; City boys trying to impress their dates; middle managers who have heard about it from their boss and have come down to try to impress a potential new one; young women who work in the arts and media, have seen it mentioned in Vogue and have come to look for Robbie Williams. The key is to choose a mix of people who won't bother the celebs and the influentials with star-spotting, and who won't make a fuss if they discover their manager doing cocaine in the toilets. If the door staff get the mix wrong, the remaining original crowd will move on and the bar owner is in difficulty. He or she has invested heavily in the decor and staff and needs to keep the place full. Do they keep their nerve and keep exclusive? Or do you try to keep your bank manager and investors happy, and let the ordinary punters in? If they choose the latter, the next wave will be what one Soho bar manager refers to as the \"Cecil Gee Posses\" - after-work groups of young male office workers in cheap suits. They have an equivalent in the gangs of after-work office girls who will come down too, but the boys are a bigger problem. As individuals they're OK; but the work suits make them feel like brothers in uniform; the strong lager makes them leery; the knowledge that they are in a trendy bar makes them show off. But the real reason they tend to be unwelcome is that they start hassling women. If the women go and don't come back, the atmosphere dies. Young men do not like drinking with each other, and women feel uncomfortable in an overly-masculine environment; this is why the history of club culture is often shaped by promoters attempting to attract cool young women to their nights. The Cecil Gee Posses will start to scare off Third Wavers, though new out-of-towners will keep coming for a look at weekends for a while until the bar's reputation fades. The owner can now a) accept the downward trajectory or b) try to make the best of it by going low-cool and bringing in the kind of celebrities they were striving to avoid 12 months ago; the EastEnders cast (notoriously easy to get to parties), teen-pop acts, and maybe a DJ who had a good reputation a few years ago to do a Thursday night. The DJ will welcome the chance to \"try something a little different\", which generally means playing his old jazz funk records. If that doesn't work, the best bet is to play up the commercial, clubbing element and get more ropey DJs; this will at least bring in the 18 to 25 year olds who inhabit puffa jackets and commercial house clubs and care more about music and drugs than ambience. When they leave - well, that's when it becomes simple. You just close down, re-open under a new name, and start again. Learning from your \"mistakes\", of course.",

And I've never had any doubts about the cause, or the personal risks involved. We backed up the RUC, and we knew the consequences: the reality of becoming a casualty oneself was incontrovertible. The rather grand concept of dying for one's country was not debated, but it was implicit, and I knew - in common with the 66% of British people who said, in the BBC's Soul of Britain survey reported this week, that they would do the same - that I was doing the right thing in fighting for my country. Admittedly, the Northern Ireland campaign didn't include the threat of fascist invasion and the sweeping away of all our liberties. That was exactly what our forebears faced in 1940, and it was not just understandable but imperative that men and women were ready to lay down their lives to defend the country. If ever there was a war fought for moral reasons, it was the second world war.<br><br> The argument that all war could be avoided if only politicians behaved themselves, and soldiers refused to fight, ignores reality. Duplicity, misjudgment and ambition are unavoidable in politics, so politicians will always create the need for war; soldiers will always know whether a cause is true. If an armed psychopath attacked all your neighbours, you would know that at some stage you would be called on to defend yourself. Conscientious objection has nothing to do with it.

Killing is a very grave act, justifiable only when the victim has done or threatens something very grave. How can you claim to respect the moral importance of human life, yet be willing to serve as a soldier, ready to kill any foreigner on command?<br><br> Your position relies on unrealistic assumptions about soldiers. First, you assume it is morally acceptable to kill them. But many soldiers don't understand their state's plans, and take up arms for economic and other reasons. So when you risk killing them, you're doing something wicked. Second, you assume that soldiers are good. But soldiers must be willing to use extreme violence, and must obey orders unquestioningly. Both characteristics are bad and dangerous.<br><br> Millions must struggle to clean up the bloody mess soldiers make - they need help. I suggest it's time to confiscate the soldiers' toys, curtail their fantasies of protection through domination, and put them to work which will benefit the country they claim to love. You believe that producing and bearing weapons helps to make the world safer. But violence is ill-suited to producing lasting peace. You talk - most war-ists do - about the second world war. Why not the first? Our country won - isn't this proof that \"war works\"? You know it isn't. Nazism was nurtured - made possible, even - by anti-German attitudes in the victorious \"peace\".

That is the basis for my position, with which you appear to agree. It is a sad fact that soldiers die serving their country. But being ready to kill any foreigner, on command? Really? How would you motivate troops to do that? Soldiers need motivation. You say many soldiers don't understand their state's plans. In my experience, soldiers know exactly why they are on active service. Northern Ireland is a good example. I do not think killing enemy soldiers or terrorists, is wicked. You say yourself that you believe there are times when the act is justifable, and so do I. It is also true that soldiers must obey orders unthinkingly (including \"Stop firing!\"). But the assumption that war is a bloody mess made by soldiers overlooks the fact that troops would, by and large, prefer to stay at home. Wars are declared by politicians.<br><br> This is how the first world war came about, and the continent then spent the 20s and the 30s rushing towards the inevitable, thanks to the aggression and misjudgments of politicians.

Letting others defend you is the prerogative only of the weak.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Neil<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Neil,</b><br><br></p> <p>We agree about how killing can be justified, then. But do you see what follows: that when a soldier kills in ignorance, on command, what he does is unjustified? It can only be morally acceptable to kill someone you know to be guilty. Terrorists come into this category; impoverished soldiers in corrupt enemy countries do not.<br><br> Are soldiers even responsible for their actions, in your view? Sometimes you say they are responsible, motivated and knowing; but sometimes you imply that they fight only against their will, forced into it by evil politicians. You can't have it both ways. You think pacifism is \"weak\" - but it is far from weak. Pacifists forgo the war-ists' option of killing off their opponents. This gives them a compelling motivation to see to it that negotiation is maintained. Luckily, - because pacifists also forgo the dubious war-ists' pleasures of creating ever more ingenious ways to kill - they also have more time, money and goodwill to invest in serving their country in this far more arduous and challenging way. There is no weakness in pacifism; just a clear-eyed recognition of the great limits on what violence can achieve.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Soran<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Soran,</b><br><br></p> <p>Ah - we have further areas of agreement. Soldiers cannot and should not kill in ignorance. This is why they need to understand why they are fighting. I agree that untrained, ill-educated troops can be persuaded to create mayhem anywhere. But everyone, especially soldiers, understands that terrorists who bomb supermarkets or target innocent civilians of a different religion are utterly wrong, especially in a democracy. I didn't mean to say that soldiers are forced into war by \"evil\" politicians - only that it is rulers who create wars. Soldiers have not, in our recent history, fought against their will but instead to protect and to defend. <br><br> In your references to \"war-ist pleasures\" and \"soldiers' toys\", you've twice walked into the biggest misconception around: that soldiers take pleasure in battle. They are generally frightened out of their wits. They know there is no pleasure to be had. We all have a duty to protect our own, and it is the charge that pacifism is blind to this that highlights its greatest weakness - although I agree the stance can often require great bravery. Violence does indeed have limits, but so does peaceful negotiating (Saddam, Galtieri). But just as we need a police force because the world is far from perfect, so too we will require an army with men ready to die for their country. There will always be aggressors, and we cannot allow them to trample our freedoms. All that is required for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Neil<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Neil,</b><br><br></p> <p>No single group creates wars. Everyone bears some responsibility, and faces a choice: continue to play your part, or try to change things. Pacifists try to change things. When I said soldiers kill in ignorance I meant that, in battle, individual soldiers never know enough about the individuals they kill, to justify their killing. Yet those enemy individuals are all people, with a moral right to the same justice as citizens.<br><br> You liken the army to a police force. As a pacifist, I support the introduction of a system of international law equipped to bring wrongdoers to justice wherever they are found. But armies of soldiers or, worse, citizens eager to \"fight for their country\", cannot possibly play this role. Police act within the law. You insist that soldiers are reluctant fighters. But you must know that many of our soldiers fight (and train others) for non-British causes. Pacifists don't think we should \"do nothing\" about tyranny. We must take stronger police-style action far earlier because we cannot act violently against a state. It is the war-ist whose arsenal encourages him to be intolerant and complacent. Why bother to negotiate? You can always use violence to drive them away. But we know people will suffer and die in this process, and more problems result. Play with dangerous toys, and people will get hurt.

Gloucestershire, unhappy that the clash between Bristol's two universities was being marketed as \"the outdoor summer party to end them all\", even hinted that Sunday's fixture might not go ahead unless the organisers, Oxfam, took extra steps to ensure that student spectators behaved themselves. The club feared a repeat of drunken scenes witnessed at a recent student match at Trent Bridge.</p> <p>The match at Nevil Road, between Bristol University and the University of the West of England (UWE), is the first in a new series of university derbies being staged this month up and down the country to raise money for rehabilitation work following the floods in Mozambique. The six Oxfam Varsity Cricket Matches - slogan: \"hitting poverty for six\" - have official backing from the unlikely trio of MCC, the Professional Cricketers' Association and the Barmy Army.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"www.oxfam.org.uk/involved/events/cricket/cricket.htm\">charity's web pages</a> confirm, the games were promoted, until Gloucestershire's intervention, as offering \"outdoor discos, swimming pools, BBQs, fancy dress and a bit of cricket in the middle of it all\". Oxfam has agreed to drop the words \"party\" and \"frisbee\" from promotional material for an occasion now billed, more soberly, as \"the ultimate summer social\". It has also reluctantly accepted that music cannot even be played to introduce batsmen during the 40-over contest, which starts at 2pm (admission \u00a33 - inquiries call 0117 970 6703).</p> <p>Mark Kirton, Gloucestershire's marketing manager, says: \"There was a bit too much emphasis on the party and drinking element, and not enough on the cricket - which should be at the centre.\" He's now confident that the club's standard limit on the quantity of alcohol which each spectator can bring in - a bottle of wine or two pints of beer - will be observed, even by 1000-2000 students in post-exam mode. \"If there is any trouble,\" he adds, \"it'll be sorted quickly by our stewards.\"</p> <p>Oxfam's co-ordinator Billy Cotton, pointing to the good record of crowds at Oxfam's varsity rugby matches, says: \"We're not stupid, and we're not naive. We've emphasised that stewarding should be effective rather than aggressive. If things get hairy, the bars will be closed.\" He adds: \"We'd have liked a little more rock'n'roll cricket. But people will still come in fancy dress, whatever the club says about that. It's a free country. There may be a few streakers at the end of the day, as at our rugby matches. But that's harmless fun.\"</p> <p><strong>And after Wasim it will be - who?</strong></p> <p>Who will replace Wasim Akram in the Channel 4 commentary box if, as expected, he's fired as a result of the Qayyum report's damning verdict on his alleged involvement in match-fixing?</p> <p>The field is thin. Most of the obvious names are already contracted elsewhere. Geoffrey Boycott, Christopher Cowdrey and Shane Warne are with TalkSport and Viv Richards has agreed to do at least the first two West Indies Tests as a summariser on the BBC's Test Match Special. Sir Viv was considered by C4 for a commentary contract this season, but it was felt he was too expensive.</p> <p>Furthermore, Viv didn't enjoy commentating for BBC television during the last World Cup. He found the earpiece he was supposed to wear as unwelcome as a batting helmet. In any case, his genial presence and discursive style are better suited to radio.</p> <p>One former Test player definitely still available is Colin Croft, who's having discussions with TMS but could help fill the C4 vacancy during some of the Windies Tests. But he too is more at home on radio. </p> <p>The unofficial word from C4 is that while Richards or maybe Graham Gooch - during the three Tests he's not with TMS - may be invited to join the odd studio discussion, Wasim is unlikely to be replaced as a commentator. \"He wasn't all that good last season anyway, though he brought cachet,\" says a source. \"We need a star. But we trawled the world last winter and came up with very few good names. We don't want just anyone. If Wasim is replaced, the favourite has to be Barry Richards.\"</p> <p><strong>Ramps throws a mid-Test party</strong></p> <p>These days Test players rarely party until the final ball has been bowled. But England and West Indies are making an exception during the second Test at Lord's. Most members of both sides have agreed to attend a Caribbean Calypso Ball in aid of Mark Ramprakash's benefit fund.</p> <p>The event takes place at the Landmark Hotel, near Lord's, on the third evening of the match, Saturday July 1 (for tickets call 020 7938 6182; for information on other benefit events, <a href=\"www.thegame.co.uk/ramps\">click here</a>).</p> <p>It's not a do for the less well-off cricket lover: tickets cost \u00a399 each. For that, you get a rum punch reception, a four-course dinner including wine, and entertainment from a steel band, limbo dancers and Sol Raye, a Nat King Cole tribute singer. Ramprakash's county team-mates Justin Langer and Angus Fraser are coming up from Chelmsford, where Middlesex are playing that weekend (Ramprakash will be making the journey, too, if he has lost his Test place). There may also be a rare chance to see Ian Botham and Mike Gatting throwing their weight around the dance floor.</p> <p>But don't expect a glimpse of Ramps, Curtly, Courtney or Jimmy strutting their stuff. Ramprakash's benefit secretary, Julia Pearce, says: \"The Test players won't be dancing the night away until 2am. But - as Mark says - you've got to have dinner somewhere during a Test. So they'll do the reception and dinner and go home at 10 o'clock.\"</p> <p><strong>Sky draw the short straw</strong></p> <p>It may turn out quite differently, but on paper the current Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge is the least attractive of this season's seven Tests. It's also the only one being screened live by BSkyB rather than Channel 4. This isn't a coincidence.</p> <p>Under the ECB's complex \u00a3103m four-year contracts with the two broadcasters, C4 automatically has exclusive live rights to all five matches in the summer's main Test series, plus one of the two games in the mini-series preceding it.</p> <p>An almost unknown clause specifies that C4 is entitled to choose which of these matches it wants. This time they made the obvious choice, plumping for the Zims' Test debut in this country, at Lord's, leaving their rivals with the Nottingham game - as well as the triangular one-day series, which is the non-negotiable centrepiece of Sky's live output.</p> <p>Last season, C4 - perhaps anxious to finetune their operation - let Sky have the first of the four New Zealand Tests, and missed a trick: Sky made a flying start to the new era of cricket coverage, bringing viewers that extraordinary game at Edgbaston in which England recovered from 45-7 to win by seven wickets inside three days (nightwatchman Alex Tudor 99 not out). It was the last thing England fans had to cheer all season. We'll know soon enough whether C4 made the right call this time.</p> <p>Charles de Lisle is the author, with Christopher Martin-Jenkins, of An Australian Summer: The Story of the 1998/9 Ashes Series (Faber).

Mark Kirton, Gloucestershire's marketing manager, says: \"There was a bit too much emphasis on the party and drinking element, and not enough on the cricket - which should be at the centre.\" He's now confident that the club's standard limit on the quantity of alcohol which each spectator can bring in - a bottle of wine or two pints of beer - will be observed, even by 1000-2000 students in post-exam mode. \"If there is any trouble,\" he adds, \"it'll be sorted quickly by our stewards.\" Oxfam's co-ordinator Billy Cotton, pointing to the good record of crowds at Oxfam's varsity rugby matches, says: \"We're not stupid, and we're not naive. We've emphasised that stewarding should be effective rather than aggressive. If things get hairy, the bars will be closed.\" He adds: \"We'd have liked a little more rock'n'roll cricket. But people will still come in fancy dress, whatever the club says about that. It's a free country. There may be a few streakers at the end of the day, as at our rugby matches. But that's harmless fun.\" And after Wasim it will be - who? Who will replace Wasim Akram in the Channel 4 commentary box if, as expected, he's fired as a result of the Qayyum report's damning verdict on his alleged involvement in match-fixing? The field is thin. Most of the obvious names are already contracted elsewhere. Geoffrey Boycott, Christopher Cowdrey and Shane Warne are with TalkSport and Viv Richards has agreed to do at least the first two West Indies Tests as a summariser on the BBC's Test Match Special. Sir Viv was considered by C4 for a commentary contract this season, but it was felt he was too expensive. Furthermore, Viv didn't enjoy commentating for BBC television during the last World Cup. He found the earpiece he was supposed to wear as unwelcome as a batting helmet. In any case, his genial presence and discursive style are better suited to radio. One former Test player definitely still available is Colin Croft, who's having discussions with TMS but could help fill the C4 vacancy during some of the Windies Tests. But he too is more at home on radio. The unofficial word from C4 is that while Richards or maybe Graham Gooch - during the three Tests he's not with TMS - may be invited to join the odd studio discussion, Wasim is unlikely to be replaced as a commentator. \"He wasn't all that good last season anyway, though he brought cachet,\" says a source. \"We need a star. But we trawled the world last winter and came up with very few good names. We don't want just anyone. If Wasim is replaced, the favourite has to be Barry Richards.\" Ramps throws a mid-Test party These days Test players rarely party until the final ball has been bowled. But England and West Indies are making an exception during the second Test at Lord's. Most members of both sides have agreed to attend a Caribbean Calypso Ball in aid of Mark Ramprakash's benefit fund. The event takes place at the Landmark Hotel, near Lord's, on the third evening of the match, Saturday July 1 (for tickets call 020 7938 6182; for information on other benefit events, click here). It's not a do for the less well-off cricket lover: tickets cost \u00a399 each. For that, you get a rum punch reception, a four-course dinner including wine, and entertainment from a steel band, limbo dancers and Sol Raye, a Nat King Cole tribute singer. Ramprakash's county team-mates Justin Langer and Angus Fraser are coming up from Chelmsford, where Middlesex are playing that weekend (Ramprakash will be making the journey, too, if he has lost his Test place). There may also be a rare chance to see Ian Botham and Mike Gatting throwing their weight around the dance floor. But don't expect a glimpse of Ramps, Curtly, Courtney or Jimmy strutting their stuff. Ramprakash's benefit secretary, Julia Pearce, says: \"The Test players won't be dancing the night away until 2am. But - as Mark says - you've got to have dinner somewhere during a Test. So they'll do the reception and dinner and go home at 10 o'clock.\" Sky draw the short straw It may turn out quite differently, but on paper the current Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge is the least attractive of this season's seven Tests. It's also the only one being screened live by BSkyB rather than Channel 4. This isn't a coincidence. Under the ECB's complex \u00a3103m four-year contracts with the two broadcasters, C4 automatically has exclusive live rights to all five matches in the summer's main Test series, plus one of the two games in the mini-series preceding it. An almost unknown clause specifies that C4 is entitled to choose which of these matches it wants. This time they made the obvious choice, plumping for the Zims' Test debut in this country, at Lord's, leaving their rivals with the Nottingham game - as well as the triangular one-day series, which is the non-negotiable centrepiece of Sky's live output. Last season, C4 - perhaps anxious to finetune their operation - let Sky have the first of the four New Zealand Tests, and missed a trick: Sky made a flying start to the new era of cricket coverage, bringing viewers that extraordinary game at Edgbaston in which England recovered from 45-7 to win by seven wickets inside three days (nightwatchman Alex Tudor 99 not out). It was the last thing England fans had to cheer all season. We'll know soon enough whether C4 made the right call this time.

      "bodyText": "The number of gay men having unprotected sex is on the increase for the first time, new research reveals. If the trend continued, rates of HIV and Aids among the homosexual community might begin to rise after years of \"safe sex\" campaigns, the researchers warn. More effective treatments for HIV and Aids may be encouraging gay men, particularly in younger age groups, to adopt \"high risk\" behaviour, according to an article in the British Medical Journal. There is concern that gay men are becoming complacent about the threat of HIV 20 years after the epidemic began, and at a time when HIV infection among homosexuals has stabilised. The report's co-author, Danielle Mercey, of University College London, suggested that \"safe sex\" campaigns needed to be more closely monitored to see if they were having an effect. \"A lot of money is spent on Aids prevention but we don't know that all of the interventions are effective.\" Dr Mercey suggested that \"giving out condoms in a bar\" and measuring the success of the initiative on the number of condoms given out was not rigorous enough. To be effective strategies to reduce the spread of HIV had to look at the wider environment in which gay men lived. \"If they have grown up in a homophobic environment in which they have to be secretive about their sexuality it is harder for them to get advice about sexual health, and they will have grown up with lower self-esteem and that leads to more risk-taking behaviour.\" Dr Mercey and her colleagues' study of 6,600 homosexual men found that in 1998, 38% admitted having unprotected anal intercourse in the past year, compared with 32% in 1996. In 1998, 21% said they had indulged in sex with a man whose HIV status they did not know, compared with 18% three years earlier. That admission will cause the greatest concern to those working in the front line of Aids prevention. Young men under 25 were much more likely to have risked having unprotected sex, the survey found. Most of the men lived in London and the findings were gathered from questionnaires distributed at bars, clubs, saunas and clinics. In a BMJ editorial, Andrew Grulich, of the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology in Sydney, said: \"Twenty years after the start of the HIV epidemic, a new generation is growing up with HIV. Within gay communities there is some evidence that optimism over HIV treatments is associated with a rise in risk behaviour.\" He added: \"In a situation where the immediate, overwhelming threat of death from Aids is no longer present, promoting condom use is likely to be much more difficult than in the 1980s.\" He warned that if high-risk behaviour continued to rise there might be another increase in HIV infection rates. Will Nutland, manager of the gay men's HIV prevention team at the Terrence Higgins Trust, drew attention to a survey of almost 10,000 men presented to a conference in March. It showed 45% had unprotected anal sex in 1999 - an increase of 7% on the previous year. The survey also showed there was an increase in the number of gay men having unprotected sex with partners whose HIV status they knew. Mr Nutland said: \"As far as we are concerned, the real story is that there has been a significant increase in the number of men having unprotected anal intercourse with a partner they knew had the same HIV status. \"But your HIV status is only as certain as the last person you had unprotected sex with, so that strategy is not foolproof.\"",

      "body": "<p>Do you remember a Fast Show sketch in which reporter Paul Whitehouse, covering the making of a plasticine-animation movie, gradually loses the will to live as an earnest young model-maker painstakingly shows him how he moves the dog's eyebrow a millionth of a millimetre before taking a shot, then moves it another millionth of a millimetre before taking another shot, thereby producing about one frame of film every six months? </p> <p>This reporter can't help recalling it while standing on the set of Aardman Animation's first full-length claymation feature, the \u00a330m Chicken Run, while an earnest young animator named Merlin, in sweat-top-baggy-short-skate-kid-chic, patiently explains how it took him two weeks to shoot a 30-second scene in which a motorbike and sidecar crashes to the ground. Plus a further week of reshoots after the film's co-directors, Nick Park and Peter Lord, reckoned it wasn't kicking up enough dust on landing. Whitehouse &amp; co may even have underestimated the laboriousness of such an enterprise. </p> <p>Aardman's unassuming creations - Morph, Wallace &amp; Gromit, Creature Comforts - are seen as a kitchen-table cottage industry, but the scale of their operation takes you by surprise. They started small - the company was founded by Lord and partner Dave Sproxton (who now heads up the company's business end) over a bunch of doodles on the former's kitchen table, while Park, who joined later, dreamt up his first ideas in the family potting shed - but, nearly 25 years and rafts of Baftas and Oscars later, Aardman is a vast warehouse nestling among Homebases and mobile phone HQs in a business park outside Bristol. </p> <p>Chicken Run - the first fruit of a \u00a3155m five-movie deal with the DreamWorks studio - is only two and a half times longer than the Wallace &amp; Gromit films, but Lord calculates that the whole enterprise, in terms of sets, models and man-hours, is \"20 times greater than anything we've attempted before.\" You get a flavour of this on Merlin's set - a perfect miniature replica of a prison camp, Colditz Hornby-style, down to the hand-crafted barbed wire and tiny wooden five-bar gates, with hills and trees backlit by a sky that goes from starry to sun-drenched at the flick of a switch. This is impressive in itself, but then you wander the maze-like corridors and discover 30 other sets behind tarpaulin drapes, featuring everything from pocket battery henhouse interiors to sinister-looking pieces of midget machinery bristling with levers and flashing lights. </p> <p>The production floors hum with white-coated young people - the average age of Aardman's 300 employees, most recruited locally, is 28 - crafting, assembling, painting, and glazing the 2,000 or so plasticine models consumed by the production with a zeal bordering on the messianic. Macabre sights abound - boxes of eyeballs and mouths, running the gamut from beatific smiles to hideous grimaces; half-built models, their wet clay tapering off to reveal the spindly wire armatures beneath, holding them together; other, finished characters being loaded into industrial-sized ovens to be baked. The overall effect is Frankenstein's laboratory meets the Ford assembly line; look out in the film's credits for Feather Gluers, Beak Wranglers and Claw Operatives. </p> <p>\"Basically,\" says Nick Park about Chicken Run, \"and this is the line we've used with everybody, I'm afraid, it's The Great Escape with battery hens.\" The plot has an egg-layer named Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha) leading a revolt among the birds enslaved on a dismal farm in northern England, including the heroically dim Babs (Jane Horrocks in Bubble mode), against its fearsome proprietor, Mrs Tweedy, and her (of course) hen-pecked husband. She enlists the help of a fast-talking Rhode Island rooster (Mel Gibson, no less) who crash-lands in the coop, but the installation of Mrs Tweedy's new pie-making machine (the mini-Heath Robinson contraption glimpsed earlier) means it's a race against time. </p> <p>Chicken Run makes knowing nods in the direction of numerous PoW movies, but it comes replete with the ultra-English love of punnery and skewed hint-of-darkness surrealism that have become Aardman trademarks. Despite the Hollywood big-gun patronage, Park and Lord's vision seems to have survived intact. When we meet in the Aardman canteen, ostentatiously adorned with posters for DreamWorks movies, they look exhausted - the fruit of three years' labour on a movie that, at the time of the visit, three months before its release date, was still being filmed (perhaps inevitable when a hard day's work produces three seconds of footage at best). </p> <p>It's obvious that Park and Lord are very different personalities. Lord, 42, looks like the lost fifth member of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young - unkempt hair, expensive glasses, abundant facial hair - and tends to lead the conversation, punctuating his observations with a big, booming laugh. Park is endearingly gauche; he hunches down in his chair and speaks in a murmur.</p> <p>Despite the accolades - the Oscars, the CBE, the freedom of the city of Preston - he has the air of an awkward adolescent, though those who recall the home-made outsize luminous green bow-tie he wore when collecting the Oscar for A Close Shave would find it hard to conclude that there wasn't a latent extrovert lurking in there somewhere. (He sat next to Naomi Campbell. What did you talk about, I ask. He thinks for a minute. \"She said she liked my tie.\" Anything else? \"She said 'Well done' when I won.\") </p> <p>As co-directors, Park and Lord have maintained a daily vigil of walking the miles of studio floor, conferring with animators. Park: \"We go round all the sets every single day, briefing people, checking cameras, lighting, shots. It's funny: it should be a slow, painstaking process, but we don't have time to be patient; we're trying to use all the parts of our brains at once. There's been a lot of improvising. One minute we're being asked whether a character's holding something in their right hand or left hand, the next we're trying to figure out the ending of the film.\" </p> <p>Park and Lord came up with the models for the characters. In an office plastered with wallcharts detailing various breeds of British poultry in exhausting detail, they've inevitably had to delegate a lot of responsibility to under-animators. Has this vexed them? Are they control freaks? Lord: \"There are, shall we say, competing visions. The animators are effectively actors, so I'm afraid we do sometimes get people asking what their puppet's motivation is. And we've got a few method animators.\" </p> <p>Park: \"The learning curve for me has been that I've had to stop assuming people know what's in my head. I've had to learn to be a better communicator and be open to what other people can give you, because I have a tendency to be a dictator. In a quiet way, of course.\" Lord: \"You do get the bizarre situation where on any given day there are maybe 12 people performing the same character at various stages in the film. So it's important for them to be synchronised.\" </p> <p>Park: \"All the animators have been meeting for lunch once a week and compare notes.\" Lord: \"It gets down to incredibly fine detail, you know, like the thickness of the plasticine on the eyelids.\" </p> <p>This is edging dangerously close to Fast Show territory (Lord says he and Park know the sketch well, and can vouch for its spooky veracity - \"Nick and I have done that interview many times\"), so we hurriedly move the conversation along. If Aardman has grown organically up to now, is the leap to features the equivalent of the Big Bang? Lord: \"Sort of, but it's just another stage in our evolution. Disney first mooted the idea of a feature around 10 years ago, but we wouldn't have been ready for it then. We've had that much more time in the intervening period to grow and build up a head of steam. This has always seemed the ultimate destination for us, the thing we'd end up doing.\" </p> <p>Park says the important thing with the DreamWorks deal is that it gives Aardman autonomy within what he calls the studio's \"benign embrace\". \"They've kept at arm's length,\" he says, \"but they've also been very helpful, in that Jeffrey Katzenberg has been flying over in his private jet from Burbank to Bristol to offer help and advice.\" </p> <p>And not interfere? Park: \"No, he's pushing us to make it better, but he definitely wants our sort of film.\" </p> <p>Lord: \"He's not saying he wants another Toy Story, but there's a little tension in there, as there would naturally be. Their business is huge box office and they have a vision of how to get that, but they're not forcing our hand, saying 'That won't play in Nebraska' or whatever. And they've taught us about how to structure a story, keep it flowing through the peaks and plateaux.\" Park: \"And it's also, like, a proper film, in terms of depth of shot and camera movements. I hadn't seen A Close Shave for a couple of years, and when I went back to it I couldn't believe how much I think differently now, the action and editing seemed so slow.\" </p> <p>Aardman's next feature will be an updated version of The Tortoise and the Hare, though Lord and Park will act only as executive producers; the latter will meanwhile be developing the project closest to his heart, a Wallace &amp; Gromit movie. The pair seem abashed at how far they've come. Lord: \"It's amazing how things grow, how we're filling ever-bigger buildings with more and more stuff. We employ all these people now, and I suppose the dream is to take more people on and become a sort of powerhouse of animated creativity. And we won't be upping sticks and moving to Burbank - it's important for us to stay around Bristol. We've made our own culture here. We actually have a CGI department, but whatever we do, we don't want it to be too slick. With Chicken Run, we wanted to keep that personal, handmade look, and that's been our biggest challenge.\" </p> <p>And finally, - why chickens? Park: \"We knew we'd hit the right note when we went to LA to pitch the idea to DreamWorks. We were having dinner, and Spielberg said 'Oh, The Great Escape's my favourite movie, and I also have a farm with 300 chickens.' It was a dream result.\" Lord: \"And I believe it was a chicken dinner to boot. It was obviously fated.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Chicken Run will be released on June 30.</p>",

And we won't be upping sticks and moving to Burbank - it's important for us to stay around Bristol. We've made our own culture here. We actually have a CGI department, but whatever we do, we don't want it to be too slick. With Chicken Run, we wanted to keep that personal, handmade look, and that's been our biggest challenge.\" And finally, - why chickens? Park: \"We knew we'd hit the right note when we went to LA to pitch the idea to DreamWorks. We were having dinner, and Spielberg said 'Oh, The Great Escape's my favourite movie, and I also have a farm with 300 chickens.' It was a dream result.\" Lord: \"And I believe it was a chicken dinner to boot. It was obviously fated.\" \u0095 Chicken Run will be released on June 30.",

      "body": "<p>I was in Europe. I was 52. It was 1999. I was in a garden in a hotel. I was reading a book. French Literary Fascism. I was drinking kir royale. I had two. The second one didn't taste right. I didn't finish it. Then I became sort of sickish or weakish or something, and all I could think about was getting to my bed and not making a fool of myself in public view. I prayed: \"Let me get to my room, please let me get to my room.\" I had ordered dinner from room service and the waiter, who had also made the drinks, had said: \"It will be my great pleasure to serve you your dinner tonight.\" I conked out. </p> <p>Then a boy was in the room with dinner. He had served me the second drink. I tried to get up and I fell against the far wall because I couldn't stand. I signed the cheque, but could barely balance myself. I fell back on to the bed. I didn't lock the door. I came to four or five hours later. I didn't know where I was. The curtains hadn't been drawn. Now it was dark; before it had been light, long before dusk. </p> <p>I had internal pain. I hurt deep inside my vagina. I said to myself. \"Well, it's cancer, and there's nothing you can do about it now so worry about it when you get home.\" I went to the toilet and found blood on my right hand, fresh, bright red, not menstrual blood, not clotted blood. I'm past bleeding. I tried to find the source of the blood. My hand got covered in it again. I found huge, deep gashes on my right leg from the middle of the back of the leg to the middle of the front. I couldn't stop the bleeding of the gashes so I tried to keep them clean. </p> <p>A few hours later, I took a shower. I had a big, strange bruise on my left breast, next to the aureole, not a regular bruise, huge, black and blue with solid white skin in the centre, as if someone had sucked it up and chewed it. I didn't feel good the next day or the day after. I thought I had been drugged and raped, but I felt confused. I couldn't stand the thought of making a wrong allegation. I thought that the bartender had done it, because he had made the drinks and he was on the room-service phone and he had flirted grandly with me, though I had not reciprocated. I thought that maybe the boy, who had brought me the second drink, was supposed to report that I had passed out. I thought the bartender had raped me. I didn't know if the boy had been there or not, but I thought yes. </p> <p>I couldn't remember, but I thought they had pulled me down toward the bottom of the bed so that my vagina was near the bed's edge and my legs were easy to manipulate. I thought that the deep, bleeding scratches, right leg, and the big bruise, left breast, were the span of a man on top of me. I had been wearing sweatpants that just fell right down. I had been wearing an undershirt. Usually I covered myself, but I had felt too sick to manage it before the boy came in with the dinner. Besides, I don't know how he got inside since the door was dead-bolted. He appeared suddenly, already in. </p> <p>In my own life, I don't have intercourse. That is my choice. I got an internal infection in the aftermath. How? It was horrible not knowing. I had literally no memory of what the man and the boy had done. It's like being operated on. You don't feel anything until you feel the pain that comes with a return to consciousness. I speculated that my body must have been relaxed, no muscles straining, no physical resistance or even tension. This repelled me. </p> <p>The hours were gone, missing. My mind went over and over that day and night for weeks and weeks turning into months and months. I couldn't find the missing hours because they weren't there, in my brain. That is why drugs such as Rohypnol and gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) are called amnesiac drugs. (Since I could taste something in my drink, it was probably GHB, called on the street Grievous Bodily Harm.) </p> <p>I lost all hope. I couldn't defend myself. I had been helpless. I had decided long ago that no one would ever rape me again; he or they or I would die. But this rape was necrophiliac: they wanted to fuck a dead woman. Why? I was scared. I thought that being forced and being conscious was better, because then you knew; even if no one ever believed you, you knew. Most rape experts agree: how can you face what you can't remember? I tried to hammer through the amnesia, but nothing broke. I was so hurt. </p> <p>A few days later, on a Sunday, at the suggestion of my mate, John, at home in Brooklyn, I placed a call to my New York feminist gynaecologist of more than a decade. I said that I thought I had been drugged and raped. She said that a gynaecological exam wouldn't prove anything one way or the other and that the call from me convinced her that she should have an unlisted phone number. I thanked her (I'm a girl) and collapsed in tears. On the plane trip home, I huddled and shook. I felt overwhelming grief as if I had died. I also felt grief for this sick world. </p> <p>I started hating every day. I hated seeing the sun rise. I couldn't put one foot in front of the other and I wanted to put a butcher's knife into my heart behind my ribs. I was very lonely. I was consumed by grief and sorrow until I was lucky enough to become numb. I thought I could resist by not dying, but that might be too hard and maybe I was too old and too tired and couldn't do it any more. My body was a curse and had betrayed me. I couldn't figure out why they would want to do this and why they would want to do it to me. </p> <p>I couldn't be consoled. I couldn't talk to anyone. How could I say the words to the people I loved, most of whom work precisely to stop violence against women: this is what he, someone or they, did to me. Yeah, I know I represent something to you, but really I'm a piece of crap because I just got raped. No, no, you're not a piece of crap when you get raped, but I am. John looked for any other explanation than rape. He abandoned me emotionally. Now a year has passed and sometimes he's with me in his heart and sometimes not. </p> <p>I don't know why the world didn't stop right then, when the creatures drugged and raped me. I don't know how the earth can still turn. I don't believe that it should be possible. I don't. I think everyone should have stopped everything because I was 52 and this happened to me. I think every person should have been in mourning. I think no one should work or spend money or love anyone ever again. I ask: \"Why me?\" I say: \"It can't have happened to me.\" I say: \"My bad pheromones or karma brought the rapist pigs to me.\" I blame me no matter what it takes. I go down the checklist: no short skirt; it was daylight; I didn't drink a lot even though it was alcohol and I rarely drink, but so what? It could have been Wild Turkey or coffee. I didn't drink with a man, I sat alone and read a book, I didn't go somewhere I shouldn't have been, wherever that might be when you are 52, I didn't flirt, I didn't want it to happen. I wasn't hungry for a good, hard fuck that would leave me pummelled with pain inside. </p> <p>And after: I don't want it to have happened. I can't remember it. They took my body from me and used it. They were inside me. I felt for stickiness. There was none. I prayed that meant they had used condoms. (I'm waiting for the outcome of a second round of HIV and other STD testing. Immediately after a drug-rape, as I didn't know then, there are about 24 hours in which to get a urine sample and 48 to 72 hours to get a blood test.) </p> <p>And then there is that I know too much. Forgive me for saying this, but it makes everything harder. I know a lot about rape. I study it. I read about it. I think about it. I listen to rape victims. I engage with prosecutors and lawyers and legislators. I write about it. I was raped before this. I remember being raped. I say that we're fighting back. I give speeches and say that women and girls are being raped and we need to do this and this and this. I know hundreds if not thousands of raped women. </p> <p>But this is new. Rape with amnesiac drugs is new. It's so easy. In most studies on rape and pornography, about 30% of men say they would rape if they could get away with it. They can. This is foolproof rape. The gang that couldn't shoot straight can do this kind of rape. You can do this hundreds of times with virtually no chance of getting caught, let alone having anyone be able to make a legal case in any court of law. And smart women with attitudes like myself can't stop these pieces of dog excrement through militance or violence or persuasion or just being reasonably polite. </p> <p>See, if there were feminist vigilantes, I couldn't even ask a favour. I can't put the bartender in the hotel room with me. I know it was he and his little accomplice, but how do I know? The circumstantial evidence that leads to the conclusion that the rape happened does not identify the rapist(s). One point for prosecutors: this is poisoning as well as rape; always bring both charges. </p> <p>As for me: about 10 days after I came home, my 84-year-old father broke his knee. He was never out of a hospital or nursing or convalescent home again until he died on December 4 1999. A few days before Christmas, I was hospitalised for bronchitis, pneumonia, cellulitis (an infection of the soft tissues in the legs - lethal if not treated with antibiotics) and blood clots. I had been wandering in delirium from a high fever on New York City streets until a young woman helped get me off the street and called John. </p> <p>I was in the hospital a month, which caused my leg muscles to atrophy, so I am learning how to use them again. I used to worry about taking a Valium or two to fall asleep in strange hotels. Now I take on average 12 pills to sleep and they only work sometimes. How can I close my eyes and voluntarily become unconscious? For the first time in my life I go to shrinks, a lucid one who prescribes drugs and an empathetic one whose speciality is in dealing with people who have been tortured. I have been tortured and this drug-rape runs through it, a river of horror. I'm feeling perpetual terror, they both tell me. I stare blankly or I say some words. I'm ready to die. </p> <p>This article appears in the current issue of the New Statesman (\u00a32, available from newsagents; for subscriptions call 0800 731 8496).

      "bodyText": "I was in Europe. I was 52. It was 1999. I was in a garden in a hotel. I was reading a book. French Literary Fascism. I was drinking kir royale. I had two. The second one didn't taste right. I didn't finish it. Then I became sort of sickish or weakish or something, and all I could think about was getting to my bed and not making a fool of myself in public view. I prayed: \"Let me get to my room, please let me get to my room.\" I had ordered dinner from room service and the waiter, who had also made the drinks, had said: \"It will be my great pleasure to serve you your dinner tonight.\" I conked out. Then a boy was in the room with dinner. He had served me the second drink. I tried to get up and I fell against the far wall because I couldn't stand. I signed the cheque, but could barely balance myself. I fell back on to the bed. I didn't lock the door. I came to four or five hours later. I didn't know where I was. The curtains hadn't been drawn. Now it was dark; before it had been light, long before dusk. I had internal pain. I hurt deep inside my vagina. I said to myself. \"Well, it's cancer, and there's nothing you can do about it now so worry about it when you get home.\" I went to the toilet and found blood on my right hand, fresh, bright red, not menstrual blood, not clotted blood. I'm past bleeding. I tried to find the source of the blood. My hand got covered in it again. I found huge, deep gashes on my right leg from the middle of the back of the leg to the middle of the front. I couldn't stop the bleeding of the gashes so I tried to keep them clean. A few hours later, I took a shower. I had a big, strange bruise on my left breast, next to the aureole, not a regular bruise, huge, black and blue with solid white skin in the centre, as if someone had sucked it up and chewed it. I didn't feel good the next day or the day after. I thought I had been drugged and raped, but I felt confused. I couldn't stand the thought of making a wrong allegation. I thought that the bartender had done it, because he had made the drinks and he was on the room-service phone and he had flirted grandly with me, though I had not reciprocated. I thought that maybe the boy, who had brought me the second drink, was supposed to report that I had passed out. I thought the bartender had raped me. I didn't know if the boy had been there or not, but I thought yes. I couldn't remember, but I thought they had pulled me down toward the bottom of the bed so that my vagina was near the bed's edge and my legs were easy to manipulate. I thought that the deep, bleeding scratches, right leg, and the big bruise, left breast, were the span of a man on top of me. I had been wearing sweatpants that just fell right down. I had been wearing an undershirt. Usually I covered myself, but I had felt too sick to manage it before the boy came in with the dinner. Besides, I don't know how he got inside since the door was dead-bolted. He appeared suddenly, already in. In my own life, I don't have intercourse. That is my choice. I got an internal infection in the aftermath. How? It was horrible not knowing. I had literally no memory of what the man and the boy had done. It's like being operated on. You don't feel anything until you feel the pain that comes with a return to consciousness. I speculated that my body must have been relaxed, no muscles straining, no physical resistance or even tension. This repelled me. The hours were gone, missing. My mind went over and over that day and night for weeks and weeks turning into months and months. I couldn't find the missing hours because they weren't there, in my brain. That is why drugs such as Rohypnol and gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) are called amnesiac drugs. (Since I could taste something in my drink, it was probably GHB, called on the street Grievous Bodily Harm.) I lost all hope. I couldn't defend myself. I had been helpless. I had decided long ago that no one would ever rape me again; he or they or I would die. But this rape was necrophiliac: they wanted to fuck a dead woman. Why? I was scared. I thought that being forced and being conscious was better, because then you knew; even if no one ever believed you, you knew. Most rape experts agree: how can you face what you can't remember? I tried to hammer through the amnesia, but nothing broke. I was so hurt. A few days later, on a Sunday, at the suggestion of my mate, John, at home in Brooklyn, I placed a call to my New York feminist gynaecologist of more than a decade. I said that I thought I had been drugged and raped. She said that a gynaecological exam wouldn't prove anything one way or the other and that the call from me convinced her that she should have an unlisted phone number. I thanked her (I'm a girl) and collapsed in tears. On the plane trip home, I huddled and shook. I felt overwhelming grief as if I had died. I also felt grief for this sick world. I started hating every day. I hated seeing the sun rise. I couldn't put one foot in front of the other and I wanted to put a butcher's knife into my heart behind my ribs. I was very lonely. I was consumed by grief and sorrow until I was lucky enough to become numb. I thought I could resist by not dying, but that might be too hard and maybe I was too old and too tired and couldn't do it any more. My body was a curse and had betrayed me. I couldn't figure out why they would want to do this and why they would want to do it to me. I couldn't be consoled. I couldn't talk to anyone. How could I say the words to the people I loved, most of whom work precisely to stop violence against women: this is what he, someone or they, did to me. Yeah, I know I represent something to you, but really I'm a piece of crap because I just got raped. No, no, you're not a piece of crap when you get raped, but I am. John looked for any other explanation than rape. He abandoned me emotionally. Now a year has passed and sometimes he's with me in his heart and sometimes not. I don't know why the world didn't stop right then, when the creatures drugged and raped me. I don't know how the earth can still turn. I don't believe that it should be possible. I don't. I think everyone should have stopped everything because I was 52 and this happened to me. I think every person should have been in mourning. I think no one should work or spend money or love anyone ever again. I ask: \"Why me?\" I say: \"It can't have happened to me.\" I say: \"My bad pheromones or karma brought the rapist pigs to me.\" I blame me no matter what it takes. I go down the checklist: no short skirt; it was daylight; I didn't drink a lot even though it was alcohol and I rarely drink, but so what? It could have been Wild Turkey or coffee. I didn't drink with a man, I sat alone and read a book, I didn't go somewhere I shouldn't have been, wherever that might be when you are 52, I didn't flirt, I didn't want it to happen. I wasn't hungry for a good, hard fuck that would leave me pummelled with pain inside. And after: I don't want it to have happened. I can't remember it. They took my body from me and used it. They were inside me. I felt for stickiness. There was none. I prayed that meant they had used condoms. (I'm waiting for the outcome of a second round of HIV and other STD testing. Immediately after a drug-rape, as I didn't know then, there are about 24 hours in which to get a urine sample and 48 to 72 hours to get a blood test.) And then there is that I know too much. Forgive me for saying this, but it makes everything harder. I know a lot about rape. I study it. I read about it. I think about it. I listen to rape victims. I engage with prosecutors and lawyers and legislators. I write about it. I was raped before this. I remember being raped. I say that we're fighting back. I give speeches and say that women and girls are being raped and we need to do this and this and this. I know hundreds if not thousands of raped women. But this is new. Rape with amnesiac drugs is new. It's so easy. In most studies on rape and pornography, about 30% of men say they would rape if they could get away with it. They can. This is foolproof rape. The gang that couldn't shoot straight can do this kind of rape. You can do this hundreds of times with virtually no chance of getting caught, let alone having anyone be able to make a legal case in any court of law. And smart women with attitudes like myself can't stop these pieces of dog excrement through militance or violence or persuasion or just being reasonably polite. See, if there were feminist vigilantes, I couldn't even ask a favour. I can't put the bartender in the hotel room with me. I know it was he and his little accomplice, but how do I know? The circumstantial evidence that leads to the conclusion that the rape happened does not identify the rapist(s). One point for prosecutors: this is poisoning as well as rape; always bring both charges. As for me: about 10 days after I came home, my 84-year-old father broke his knee. He was never out of a hospital or nursing or convalescent home again until he died on December 4 1999. A few days before Christmas, I was hospitalised for bronchitis, pneumonia, cellulitis (an infection of the soft tissues in the legs - lethal if not treated with antibiotics) and blood clots. I had been wandering in delirium from a high fever on New York City streets until a young woman helped get me off the street and called John. I was in the hospital a month, which caused my leg muscles to atrophy, so I am learning how to use them again. I used to worry about taking a Valium or two to fall asleep in strange hotels. Now I take on average 12 pills to sleep and they only work sometimes. How can I close my eyes and voluntarily become unconscious? For the first time in my life I go to shrinks, a lucid one who prescribes drugs and an empathetic one whose speciality is in dealing with people who have been tortured. I have been tortured and this drug-rape runs through it, a river of horror. I'm feeling perpetual terror, they both tell me. I stare blankly or I say some words. I'm ready to die.

      "body": "<p>Not long ago, I was sitting in a cinema in Mexico City waiting for the main feature to start. What seemed like a fairly predictable commercial was being shown. The bride and groom were standing hand-in-hand at the front of the church as the wedding ceremony reached its climax. The priest asked the Spanish equivalent of \"Does anyone know why this man and woman should not be joined together in holy matrimony?\" Suddenly the young man sitting next to me in the stalls leapt to his feet. \"Yes,\" he cried, \"I do!\" </p> <p>On screen, the bride turned round and, looking right at our corner of the cinema, asked something along the lines of: \"Jorge - is that you?\" \"Yes,\" shouted the young man as all heads turned towards him. \"I still love you!\" The groom intervened, also looking angrily in our direction, and the young man fled the cinema to much laughter and bemusement from all of us as the logo of the advertiser, Celebrando.com, was shown on screen. The advertiser, as I discovered when I clicked on later to their website, caters for every wedding eventuality from receptions to contraception and this was its way of making a stir in the city, using out-of-work young actors in selected cinemas to play the part of the jilted lover. </p> <p>It was the first and only interactive commercial I have ever come across and inquiries of ad people, both in Mexico and here in Los Angeles have failed to elicit any others. </p> <p>The stunt came to mind watching John Woo's Mission: Impossible 2, or M:I-2 as it must be called, which has now opened to cheerful and friendly reviews all over the US. All that seemed to be missing from the stunts - hanging from cliffs, flying through the air on motorbikes - was someone in the audience to leap up and take part in the action; when I saw it they nearly did so to prevent Tom Cruise from being, well... they managed to stop themselves. The stunts are so spectacularly realistic that surely this must be the next stage: after virtual reality, reality. </p> <p>M:I-2 has already beaten some record, as films so often do these days; this one, I think, for the largest grossing movie to open on a Wednesday. It has been playing to full houses as the US takes its Memorial Day holiday. The reviews have been mainly favourable and more than one critic has noted the similarities in plot to Hitchcock's Notorious, although the backdrop here is Sydney, looking as lovely as she is, rather than Rio. Then it was Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains; now it is Cruise, Thandie Newton and Dougray Scott. </p> <p>Anyone who shoots someone in the thigh and then rubs his heel in the wound as Dougray Scott's character does in M:I-2 is clearly not a nice person and it is encouraging to see that Scots are finally taking over from Russians, South Africans and Arabs as leading Hollywood villains. It started with Fat Bastard in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me last year and has continued through Robert Carlyle in the last Bond film. Now Scott is playing a complete swine. For too long Scots have had to play noble losers (see Braveheart, everyone called Jock in war films, Trainspotting and Scottish football 1970 to present day) so it is refreshing if they are take over as international bastards, whether fat or slim. </p> <p>Watching all the actors strut their stuff reminds us, of course, that the 135,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) have been on strike for four weeks as part of their dispute over attempts to change the way in which they are paid. Advertisers want to pay them in lump sums rather than residuals, which actors say would cost them dear. The advertisers say the actors would be better off under the new scheme, which the unions have suggested must mean this is the first time employers have ever offered employees a better deal than they asked for. </p> <p>Even in Los Angeles, where many of the strikers live, there has been only limited coverage of the dispute and the strike has had to rely on extraneous events to make itself heard. The strikers got a boost when golfer Tiger Woods announced that he would not film commercials until the strike was settled, and then suffered a set-back when former general and current George W Bush backer Colin Powell filmed a public service announcement against the unions' wishes. </p> <p>But, as was reported last week, the strike has led to one dust-up that focussed attention on the dispute in unintended ways. The commercials firm owned by British directors Ridley and Tony Scott, RSA USA, placed an ad in a trade journal which showed an elderly black woman naked from the waist up with the caption: \"In South Africa, this is what SAG means.\" </p> <p>The ad was a come-on to advertisers to beat the strike by filming in South Africa and led to a picketing of RSA's Los Angeles office by angry union members and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Neither of the Scotts knew anything about the ad until it appeared and they were livid, issuing a fulsome apology to all concerned and expressing their anger. </p> <p>Now those responsible have all been given the thumbs down by the director of Gladiator. A press release from RSA USA this week announces that \"due to the offensive ad\" RSA has ended its business relationships with director Marcus Nispel and others involved. They should have put that Dougray Scott on to them.</p> <p>\u0095 John Patterson is on holiday.</p>",

M:I-2 has already beaten some record, as films so often do these days; this one, I think, for the largest grossing movie to open on a Wednesday. It has been playing to full houses as the US takes its Memorial Day holiday. The reviews have been mainly favourable and more than one critic has noted the similarities in plot to Hitchcock's Notorious, although the backdrop here is Sydney, looking as lovely as she is, rather than Rio. Then it was Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains; now it is Cruise, Thandie Newton and Dougray Scott. Anyone who shoots someone in the thigh and then rubs his heel in the wound as Dougray Scott's character does in M:I-2 is clearly not a nice person and it is encouraging to see that Scots are finally taking over from Russians, South Africans and Arabs as leading Hollywood villains. It started with Fat Bastard in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me last year and has continued through Robert Carlyle in the last Bond film. Now Scott is playing a complete swine. For too long Scots have had to play noble losers (see Braveheart, everyone called Jock in war films, Trainspotting and Scottish football 1970 to present day) so it is refreshing if they are take over as international bastards, whether fat or slim. Watching all the actors strut their stuff reminds us, of course, that the 135,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) have been on strike for four weeks as part of their dispute over attempts to change the way in which they are paid. Advertisers want to pay them in lump sums rather than residuals, which actors say would cost them dear. The advertisers say the actors would be better off under the new scheme, which the unions have suggested must mean this is the first time employers have ever offered employees a better deal than they asked for. Even in Los Angeles, where many of the strikers live, there has been only limited coverage of the dispute and the strike has had to rely on extraneous events to make itself heard. The strikers got a boost when golfer Tiger Woods announced that he would not film commercials until the strike was settled, and then suffered a set-back when former general and current George W Bush backer Colin Powell filmed a public service announcement against the unions' wishes. But, as was reported last week, the strike has led to one dust-up that focussed attention on the dispute in unintended ways. The commercials firm owned by British directors Ridley and Tony Scott, RSA USA, placed an ad in a trade journal which showed an elderly black woman naked from the waist up with the caption: \"In South Africa, this is what SAG means.\" The ad was a come-on to advertisers to beat the strike by filming in South Africa and led to a picketing of RSA's Los Angeles office by angry union members and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Neither of the Scotts knew anything about the ad until it appeared and they were livid, issuing a fulsome apology to all concerned and expressing their anger. Now those responsible have all been given the thumbs down by the director of Gladiator. A press release from RSA USA this week announces that \"due to the offensive ad\" RSA has ended its business relationships with director Marcus Nispel and others involved. They should have put that Dougray Scott on to them. \u0095 John Patterson is on holiday.",

On their combined salaries as BBC producer and agent, they are evidently able to afford a sumptuous riverside apartment, whose spectacular views are glimpsed by day and - with twinkling lights - by night. Together, they endure the indignities of IVF with regulation self-deprecatory humour and unhappily undiminished physical ardour.

      "bodyText": "\"That's very good! That's very funny!\" It takes a special kind of chutzpah, a real head for heights, to make one of the characters in your film a writer, and then make him lavish writerly praise on the dialogue you've written for him to overhear. But such a writer, and now such a film-maker is Ben Elton, that prodigiously industrious man whose fate it has been to be patronised by pundits with a fraction of his abilities, and despite having written one of the most brilliant west end stage comedies of the 90s in the form of Gasping, and a gripping Hollywood novel in Popcorn, destined to have each new product discussed only in relation to a dimly-remembered past as the spangly-jacketed scourge of Thatch. His debut film, Maybe Baby, follows so closely on the heels of his novel, Inconceivable, that it isn't an adaptation so much as the second prong of a multi-media pincer-movement on the cinemagoing public. The speaker is Hugh Laurie, playing Sam, a lovely, gentle chap who is trying for a baby with his delectable wife Lucy (Joely Richardson). On their combined salaries as BBC producer and agent, they are evidently able to afford a sumptuous riverside apartment, whose spectacular views are glimpsed by day and - with twinkling lights - by night. Together, they endure the indignities of IVF with regulation self-deprecatory humour and unhappily undiminished physical ardour. There is a prime example of what Ben Elton, in his genteel way, calls a \"knob gag\": \"I've seen harder knobs on the door of a bouncy castle!\" But Lucy is on the verge of an affair with a dishy actor, and Sam commits an adultery of the mind.

      "body": "<p>With a prolific output of more than 90 films, Jean Rouch at a youthful 82 continues producing an imposing body of work. Twenty of his films will be screening at London's ICA over the next 10 days. Moi un Noir (1959), Rouch's first feature film - praised by Jean-Luc Godard as the greatest French film since the liberation - will screen for the second time ever to a public audience in London. </p> <p>Moi un Noir is raw cinema with an enormous vitality and spontaneity, closer to the free improvisational methods in the early work of John Cassavetes and Shirley Clarke - except that with Rouch, unlike Cassavetes, we are never quite sure whether we are witnessing actors or real people. The main character of this film is Oumaru Ganda, a young migrant worker from Niger surviving precariously as a dock worker in the slum area of Trashville in Abdijan on the Ivory Coast. Oumaru takes the pseudonym of Edward G Robinson, the American film star. </p> <p>The film is an account of a week in the life of Robinson and his friends. It can be viewed as an exposure of the conflicts between a traditional way of life and the western values encroaching upon it; as a conflict of life, dream and desires; and as a document that attempts to expose the joys and anxieties of the African urban generation in the late 50s. </p> <p>The visuals, which were shot mute, are accompanied by a commentary from Robinson, a monologue in which he expresses his aspirations, his uncertainties and his day-to-day realities. It has an overpowering sense of honesty, intimacy and poignancy - a quality that can be at least partly attributed to the power of the spoken word in an oral society. </p> <p>Moi un Noir is an interplay of styles. The dialogue is never in synch, the camera restless and handheld, the editing dynamic. It also anticipates many of the cinematic styles which were to change the vocabulary of cinema when taken up by the French New Wave: specifically, the jump-cut; the use of fiction constructed with the stylistic devices of documentary film; the handheld camera; voiceover commentary; the actor addressing the camera; shooting sequences with minimal lighting; and the use of advertisements, posters and slogans as punctuation. No wonder Godard, writing for Cahiers du Cinema, says: \"Everything, in effect, is completely new in Jean Rouch's film - script, shooting and sound recording. We are presented with a text of wonderful verve and spontaneity... his film consequently offers the open sesame to poetry.\" </p> <p>On a more sober note, but no less innovative, is Chronicle of a Summer (Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9, 1960). This is Rouch's best known work, the film that redefined the documentary and was arguably responsible for spawning the term cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Chronicle of a Summer was co-directed with the sociologist Edgar Morin and made use for the first time of new technology: a portable 16mm lightweight handheld camera with a portable synchronised sound recorder. Though this was only 40 years ago, it was the first time film crews could be reduced to two, a camera person and a sound recordist, who could now walk the streets of Paris, filming and recording simultaneously. </p> <p>The film opens with a random sample of passers-by being asked: \"How do you live?\" Gradually the answers develop into explorations of politics, loneliness, memory, work and alienation. The film is both a portrait of Paris life in the summer of 1960, and an examination of the difficulty of making an honest film, of the inevitable gap between reality as lived and reality as filmed. </p> <p>Screening in this programme are many of the early African short films by Rouch. From his early 50s films it is definitely worth catching the memorable Les Ma\u00eetres Fous (The Mad Masters), by far the most controversial and sensational film in the programme. Les Ma\u00eetres Fous, banned by the British government in the 50s, was supposedly the inspiration for Genet's play The Blacks, and an influence on Peter Brook's theatre production of Marat-Sade. </p> <p>The 36-minute film follows a possession ceremony of the Hauka sect in Ghana during British colonial rule. After a series of public confessions around an altar in a forest clearing, a group of men enter into a state of collective possession. We expect the initiated to be possessed by spirits of their ancestors - but no, the possessed are taken over by the spirits of \"power\" personified in the form of the oppressors, the English ruling class, the colonial masters in Ghana. </p> <p>Mimicking and writhing in frantic caricatures of their \"Mad Masters,\" the possessed become the colonial officials - the English governor, the lieutenant, the doctor and his wife, the governor's secretary. This hysterical ritual culminates with the sacrificial killing and eating of a dog. The Hauka, being Muslim, undergo total debasement by eating the dog, which is strictly forbidden in Islam. </p> <p>The following day we revisit the Hauka again. They are relaxed and happy. Rouch's commentary concludes the film: \"When you compare these faces to yesterday's horrible faces you cannot help but ask whether these men know of some remedies which allow them not to be abnormal, but perfectly integrated to their surroundings.\" Rouch's commentary points out that by acting out and identifying with aspects of European power, this frenzied possession achieves a psychotherapeutic function that allows the Hauka to overcome the tensions of colonialism. The anxieties that accumulate when traditional life is disrupted by colonialism express themselves through acts of hysteria and self-debasement, which allows the Hauka to conform to their present social condition. </p> <p>Unlike Les Ma\u00eetres Fous, where Rouch attempts to explain and position the ritual within a socio-political context, Robert Gardner in Forests of Bliss does the opposite. This is a feature-length film with no voice-over, no facts, no information and no subtitles. It is a film of absolute visual poetry, as incomprehensible and hypnotic as magic and religion, requiring from the viewer only to succumb to the experience.</p> <p>Shot by Gardner in Benares, India, in the 80s, Forests of Bliss relies purely on the aesthetic capacity of the filmed image and the exquisite use, and editing, of sound to create feelings and mood of place. It is a film that reinforces our capacity as passing travellers in a city of temples, a holy city of incomprehensible rituals and a labyrinth of circling passageways that lead to the river Ganges and eventually to death. </p> <p>Whereas Forests of Bliss is often criticised for being too sensuous and apolitical, the opposite can be said of N'ai - The Story of a Kung Woman. In 1951, co-director John Marshall, at the age of 17, started filming with a clockwork wind-up Bolex camera with no sound, and completed filming in 1978. He made several seminal short films on the Kung San people of Namibia; but also, from all this film shot over a period of 28 years, one major film emerged. </p> <p>N'ai - The Story of a Kung Woman is narrated by the 33-year-old N'ai, who is dependent on food aid and is living in the desolate waste grounds of a relocation camp in Namibia. Facing the camera, she begins to tell her story: \"Before the white people came, I was a young girl...\" Through flashbacks and juxtaposition the tragedy of the Kung San people unfolds. The living conditions of N'ai and her family are intercut with earlier sequences filmed from her life: her childhood, her marriage at the age of eight, the arrival of the white man, the arrival of the church, the army and the war. It is an extraordinarily powerful testament to the degradation and the damage done to a people who were once self-sufficient and autonomous. </p> <p>These are only a few of a stunning programme of films, seminal works within the history of documentary cinema. You won't see them on television, and they are rarely, or never, seen in this country.</p> <p>\u0095 Possessing Vision starts today, and runs to June 11, at the ICA, London SW1.

Facing the camera, she begins to tell her story: \"Before the white people came, I was a young girl...\" Through flashbacks and juxtaposition the tragedy of the Kung San people unfolds. The living conditions of N'ai and her family are intercut with earlier sequences filmed from her life: her childhood, her marriage at the age of eight, the arrival of the white man, the arrival of the church, the army and the war. It is an extraordinarily powerful testament to the degradation and the damage done to a people who were once self-sufficient and autonomous. These are only a few of a stunning programme of films, seminal works within the history of documentary cinema. You won't see them on television, and they are rarely, or never, seen in this country. \u0095 Possessing Vision starts today, and runs to June 11, at the ICA, London SW1. Details: 020-7930 3647.",

Fifty officers worked through the night stopping passers-by on both sides of the Thames at Hammersmith and on neighbouring west London bridges, in a bid to find witnesses who saw anything suspicious. More than 24 hours after the explosion, no group has admitted planting the bomb, amid speculation that it was the work of dissident Irish republicans. Security was being stepped up as police last night confirmed that the device comprised between 1kg and 2kg of high explosive, and was fully detonated. Anti-terrorist officers supported by uniform officers stopped members of the public on neighbouring west London road bridges in Chiswick and Putney from about 1am today. \"We are speaking to motorists and passers-by who may have been in the area during that time period the previous night,\" said a Scotland Yard spokeswoman. \"We will be asking if they saw anyone acting suspiciously near the bridge or in a car before the explosion.\" Deputy assistant commissioner Alan Fry, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, urged people to be vigilant in the wake of the attack. \"I am asking people that if they see a suspect package to contact us immediately on 999.\" He added there would be more high visibility policing on London's streets in the wake of the bomb and said measures would be taken to reassure the public. \"I can tell you police had no prior notice - no threatening calls or anybody claiming responsibility.\" Asked if there was a possible link with Irish terrorists he said: \"I am not going to speculate but clearly they would be a line of inquiry.\" The bomb went off without warning at around 4.30am yesterday, causing traffic chaos. The device, attached to a girder on the bridge, caused structural damage but no injuries. Residents living nearby described how windows in their homes were blown out by the force of the blast. The bridge might be closed to pedestrians and traffic for a number of weeks while engineers assess the damage and ensure the structure is safe. The attack triggered a number of hoax calls including warnings a device had been planted in the Dartford Tunnel in Kent, causing it to be closed for 35 minutes. Hammersmith bridge has been targeted twice before by terrorists, the last time in 1996 when the most-powerful Semtex bomb ever used by the IRA on the mainland failed to go off. Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor said dissident republicans trying to destabilise the peace process could have been behind the blast. \"If it's terrorist-linked I would expect it to be the breakaway groups within the republican movement, something like the Real IRA or the Continuity IRA,\" he said. \"Clearly, their objective now is to upset the Provisional IRA programme of putting arms out of use. It must always be remembered there are minority republican terrorist groups still on the ground, still potentially active.\" Terrorism expert David George agreed that the attack was most probably the work of the Real/Continuity IRA, which broke from the Provisionals three years ago.

So no agreements of any significance can be expected.</p> <p>Yet this policy vacuum is not just dictated by the electoral calendar. It highlights a much deeper crisis and a need for radical choices. On the western side, the empty encounter in Moscow epitomises the failure of Clinton's Russian project in every field - political, economic and strategic. Back in 1993 when Clinton held his first summit with a Russian president, he and his advisers hoped gradually to transform their defeated cold war enemy into a democratic market economy and a partner in for eign affairs. But every step they took worked against their stated goals.</p> <p>In the fierce arguments between the Kremlin and the Russian parliament over the distribution of power, which was the big theme of 1993, the US president repeatedly urged Boris Yeltsin to impose executive supremacy by closing parliament down and changing the constitution. Instead of a democracy with checks and balances, Russia became what Lilya Shevtsova, one of its best independent analysts calls, \"an elective autocracy\". This was confirmed in 1996, when with full Clinton support Yeltsin combined American advertising techniques with ruthless editorial control of TV, partly still under state ownership and partly in the hands of friendly oligarchs, to demonise the opposition and win re-election.</p> <p>Russia's economic reforms were as badly distorted as its path to pluralism. The corruption-prone privatisation which the west encouraged, the failure to regulate the new private banks, and the transfer of the country's energy resources to Kremlin cronies led to a haemorrhage of national capital into off-shore accounts. In response, western financial institutions merely stepped up pressure for cuts in government spending to stem the budget deficit. The result was a massive drop in industrial output and the pauperisation of millions.</p> <p>In foreign affairs Clinton's campaign to expand Nato eastwards alienated Russians of all political persuasions and is still at the core of the country's suspicions of the west. It has been compounded by Washington's continuing efforts to woo the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, and divert their oil and gas reserves as well as those of the Caspian, from flowing through Russia.</p> <p>So the fact that an unknown ex-KGB man with illiberal instincts was nominated by the financial oligarchy to exploit another flawed electoral process and become Russia's new leader is in part a measure of Clinton's mistakes. Russian factors, of course, also play a role. The country's long history of authoritarianism, its power-holders' inability to accept a legitimate role for opposition, and the intelligentsia's habits of swinging wildly from servility to alienation, meant that the transition to democracy should have been handled more gradually and with greater sensitivity.</p> <p>Now Russia stands at a new crossroads. Its internal policies are moving away from western control since rising oil prices have given it the first chance of growth for a decade, as well as less need for foreign loans.</p> <p>But it faces a key strategic choice in foreign affairs. During the Yeltsin period it veered from subservient pro-westernism under Andrei Kozyrev as foreign minister to an emphasis on \"multi- polarity\" under Yevgeni Primakov. Some Moscow think-tanks are now counselling \"selective engagement\" with the west and a pronounced orientation towards Europe.</p> <p>This makes sense for several reasons. The switch towards close relations with China, which Primakov encouraged, was largely a reaction to Nato's expansion and a way of cocking a snook at the west. Russia needs good relations with its largest Asian neighbour, but to make them a lever for solving problems in other regions is dangerous.</p> <p>The external changes which will affect Russia most in the next half-decade are not in Asia, but Europe. They are the gradual enlargement of the European Union, the slow build-up of a European defence identity, and the future shape of Nato. Putin was right recently to stress that Russia is a European state, and to affirm this by inviting EU leaders to Moscow this week before Clinton comes. Russia can no longer pretend to a global role, no more than European powers can, whether individually or as the European Union. But Russia needs to engage closely with Europe for economic and well as political reasons. If it is to have any hope of delaying the further expansion of Nato - which would be good for most Europeans, and not just Russia - it must work hard in Europe to show it can be a genuine long-term partner.</p> <p>For that to happen Russia must end its Chechen folly. Having secured his election with the Chechen war, Putin has a chance to enhance his foreign policy by ending it through dialogue with Chechen leaders and an acceptance that atrocities against civilians only provide new grounds for Chechen resentment.

Witness testimony also suggested that the girl's body only appeared in the roadside ditch after McGinn had been arrested.</p> <p>McGinn claims he was framed by a policeman in the Brown County sheriff's office.</p> <p>\"He told me in 1987 I better get out of Brown county,\" he said. \"My little girl was killed after she saw a cop selling drugs at her school. Then that policeman was the one who came back and found the so-called weapon. He came back and just happens to find it. It's kind of strange.\"</p> <p>The McGinn case has focused attention on Mr Bush's record on capital punishment in an election year. He has overseen a record 131 executions since his election as Texas governor. He has commuted one death sentence on the recommendation of the state's parole board, but before yesterday had never exercised his right to grant a 30-day stay of execution.</p> <p>The death penalty is not normally a political issue in US elections, as a significant majority of the population supports capital punishment.</p> <p>However, after a string of cases in which convicts were proved innocent - some with the help of DNA evidence - after spending years on death row, the Illinois governor, George Ryan, declared a moratorium on executions earlier this year. Several other states are considering following his lead.</p> <p>Advances in DNA analysis have boosted the moves towards reform. The FBI recently released figures showing that out of 18,000 DNA tests it carried out in rape cases in recent years, 26% had ruled out the principal suspect.</p> <p>Mr Bush has voiced support for DNA tests in capital cases. Asked about McGinn's case he said: \"I'm inclined to [intervene] because I want the man to have his full day in court. If there is any doubt, any outstanding evidence that exon erates him from the rape, we ought to look at it.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Mr Bush said yesterday that he was waiting for a regional appeal court to carry out an 11th-hour examination of McGinn's case before stepping in, but political observers in Texas said they thought he was almost certain to grant the 30-day reprieve if the court turns down the prisoner's appeal.</p> <p>If a DNA test proves that the semen and pubic hair found on Stephanie Flanary is not McGinn's it would technically clear him of the rape, not the murder. But without an \"aggravating factor\" in the killing, it would not be a capital offence under Texas law.</p> <p>\"I live on hope and faith that he will do the right thing,\" McGinn said. \"Like everyone else I would like to live a hundred more years, as long as it was not another hundred years in this place.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If I am to die, I hope that somewhere further down the road, there is a law passed that each and every prisoner has the right to prove his innocence. \"</p>",

His fate has become a politically charged test case for the use of DNA in US criminal appeals, at a time when a group of lawyers and politicians is pushing for legislation granting prisoners an automatic right to genetic \"fingerprinting\" to prove their innocence. The new measures are being opposed by prosecutors who say they will be used by convicts as a delaying tactic to slow down the justice system. After a man was exonerated of a rape two years ago, thanks to DNA testing, a Texas county clerk's office destroyed \"rape kits\" which preserved genetic evidence from 50 other old cases. Lee Haney, the prosecutor in McGinn's case, has argued against the DNA tests, saying that the outcome should not affect his conviction. McGinn spoke to the Guardian a day after the Texas court of criminal appeals rejected his appeal for DNA tests of semen and hair found on the body of Stephanie Flanary, 12, who was found dead in a ditch in 1993. Police found her blood in McGinn's car and an axe with her blood on it in the back of his van. But police only found the axe four days after the girl disappeared and after three previous searches of the same vehicle. Witness testimony also suggested that the girl's body only appeared in the roadside ditch after McGinn had been arrested. McGinn claims he was framed by a policeman in the Brown County sheriff's office. \"He told me in 1987 I better get out of Brown county,\" he said. \"My little girl was killed after she saw a cop selling drugs at her school. Then that policeman was the one who came back and found the so-called weapon. He came back and just happens to find it. It's kind of strange.\" The McGinn case has focused attention on Mr Bush's record on capital punishment in an election year. He has overseen a record 131 executions since his election as Texas governor. He has commuted one death sentence on the recommendation of the state's parole board, but before yesterday had never exercised his right to grant a 30-day stay of execution. The death penalty is not normally a political issue in US elections, as a significant majority of the population supports capital punishment. However, after a string of cases in which convicts were proved innocent - some with the help of DNA evidence - after spending years on death row, the Illinois governor, George Ryan, declared a moratorium on executions earlier this year. Several other states are considering following his lead. Advances in DNA analysis have boosted the moves towards reform. The FBI recently released figures showing that out of 18,000 DNA tests it carried out in rape cases in recent years, 26% had ruled out the principal suspect. Mr Bush has voiced support for DNA tests in capital cases. Asked about McGinn's case he said: \"I'm inclined to [intervene] because I want the man to have his full day in court. If there is any doubt, any outstanding evidence that exon erates him from the rape, we ought to look at it.\" A spokeswoman for Mr Bush said yesterday that he was waiting for a regional appeal court to carry out an 11th-hour examination of McGinn's case before stepping in, but political observers in Texas said they thought he was almost certain to grant the 30-day reprieve if the court turns down the prisoner's appeal. If a DNA test proves that the semen and pubic hair found on Stephanie Flanary is not McGinn's it would technically clear him of the rape, not the murder. But without an \"aggravating factor\" in the killing, it would not be a capital offence under Texas law. \"I live on hope and faith that he will do the right thing,\" McGinn said. \"Like everyone else I would like to live a hundred more years, as long as it was not another hundred years in this place.\" He added: \"If I am to die, I hope that somewhere further down the road, there is a law passed that each and every prisoner has the right to prove his innocence. \"",

      "bodyText": "If a team can be inspired by sudden contrasts in their surroundings then, for England, the European Championship is already half-won. Within hours of beating Ukraine 2-0 on a chilly Wembley evening England flew into summer here yesterday to prepare for tomorrow's game against Malta, which will complete their warm-up programme. Precisely what the value of this exercise is remains obscure. True, there is a Maltese vote on the Fifa executive to be sought before the hosts for the 2006 World Cup are decided in Zurich in a month's time, and England's bid cannot afford to miss a trick just now. From a footballing point of view, however, Kevin Keegan will learn little, especially as his squad of 22 has been finalised. It is not as if England needed to come to Malta GC to be reminded of the importance of outstanding crosses, David Beckham having spent the last two games pressing the point home. Yet Keegan will have plenty to ponder by the Mediterranean. Encouraging though much of England's performance was in beating Ukraine, the match posed more questions than it answered. Hard though Steve McManaman tried, he again became trapped on the left wing and was never remotely the influence Keegan had wanted him to be. The England coach had asked McManaman to do what he did for Real Madrid in the latter stages of the Champions League, but the circumstances were always going to make this a well-nigh impossible task. Quite apart from the fact that the right-footed Phil Neville is no Roberto Carlos on the left, McManaman did not get the ball frequently or early enough. \"Steve did OK,\" said Keegan yesterday, \"but we didn't get the ball to him enough in the areas where we wanted him to be.\" Keegan may persist with McManaman in a free role but the performances of two others will surely have given him food for thought. Paul Scholes offered further evidence that he is best equipped to be the fulcrum of the team. Whether holding in midfield, moving forward with the ball or appearing in scoring positions through shrewd runs, Scholes confirmed his club manager's view that eventually he will prove to be the best footballer England have. Then there is Nick Barmby, who after coming off the bench wasted no time in supplying the element of surprise that has gone missing from England's game. The pass that set up Emile Heskey for a chance the striker fumbled was a reminder of what the player was starting to bring to England's performances before he vanished from the international scene four years ago. \"I can't remember anyone coming off the bench for England and making an impact so quickly,\" Keegan mused. \"Barmby is now playing better than he has ever done and you find yourself wanting to get that into the England side. He has made a late run into the squad. When we played Argentina in February he was not under consideration.\" Keegan, then, is a in a relatively healthy position from an attacking point of view. Andy Cole's omission on fitness grounds is now an irrelevance. While Barmby and the impressive Steven Gerrard, resting a tweaked achilles, are unlikely to start against Portugal on Monday week, few England teams stay unchanged for long in major tournaments. In the meantime Richard Wright, the third choice in goal, will play the whole match tomorrow, a game Keegan promises will not be a training session.

No beds were free in Leeds because of the flu epidemic. She was later told by doctors at Leeds general infirmary that the cancer had spread, making surgery impossible. Her family blamed the delays for the progression of the disease. She died last week and her funeral was held yesterday. A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals said: \"We are very sorry to learn of the death at home of Mrs Skeet.\" He said an inquiry was conducted into the circumstances surrounding her treatment. \"The report is with the secretary of state for health.\" Mrs Skeet's plight led to accusations that the government failed to act to resolve the crisis caused by the flu bug which gripped the NHS last winter. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, ordered a full inquiry into the case. She was admitted to Leeds general infirmary last December but surgery was cancelled initially because a key member of the surgical team came down with flu. The operation was then cancelled a further three times at the last minute because no intensive care beds were available in Leeds. Doctors then told her the cancer was inoperable because it had spread too far. Mrs Skeet's daughter Jane, 32, of Horbury, near Wakefield, criticised the government for allowing the shortage of intensive care beds. She said at the time: \"The medical team told us she was operable on and say the five-week delay caused it to spread. \"You put your faith and your lives in the hands of the NHS and you feel no need to question it. \"She fell back on the NHS and still believed in it. \"She always felt it was understaffed, underfunded and the doctors overworked but she never imagined it could come to this.

Puente, a bandleader and percussionist who recorded more than 100 albums in his six decades in the business, died on Wednesday night at New York University medical centre after complications during heart surgery. President Bill Clinton - who once said \"Just hearing Tito Puente's name makes you want to get up and dance\" - paid tribute to the star by saying that his spirit would endure in his music. The Cuban-born salsa singer Celia Cruz added: \"Our world is in mourning because one of the souls of Latin music has died.\" Puente, who was born in new York to Puerto Rican parents, won the last of his five Grammy awards in February for his Mambo Birdland album. Puente's music was rooted in Spanish Harlem and he raised the mambo and cha-cha-cha to artistic and commercial heights during the 1950s. He became a regular headliner at the New York palladium and in the 1960s he headed to Hollywood where he collaborated with the brightest Latino and jazz stars of the day.

Nobody was injured and the blast did not cause significant damage, but security sources fear it was designed as a \"shot across the bows\", showing that hardline republicans opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process still have a destructive capability and can easily avoid detection. If dissident republicans were involved, the bomb would mark their first successful attack in England. No warnings were received before the bomb exploded at 4.30am and no groups have claimed responsibility. Speaking from the scene in west London, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, the head of the anti-terrorist branch, said he was open-minded about who was responsible but indicated that republican involvement was an obvious line of inquiry. Seven months ago, Scotland Yard said Britain was on its highest level of terrorist alert since 1998 because of the \"credible and real threat\" posed to the capital by a coalition of republican terrorist groups. The warning came after intelligence gathering operations in the UK and Ireland, and risk assessments by MI5. Yesterday, sources said the level had not changed since then, remaining at the second highest possible. MI5 has been quietly warning for some months about the threat of bomb attacks in Northern Ireland and Britain, particularly from the Real IRA, the splinter group behind the bomb in Omagh, Co Tyrone, which killed 29 people in August 1998. Security sources said yesterday's bomb could have been placed by a British-based cell sympathetic to the rejectionist groups, or by \"day trippers\" who came from Northern Ireland via the republic. Although dangerous, MI5 sources yesterday insisted that the dissident groups do not possess the manpower or material resources of the provisional IRA. One of the problems police face is that the dissidents have not revealed a system of coded warnings.

Scotland Yard sources said the bomb was a \"sophisticated device\" that was packed with between one and two kilos (2-4lbs) of Semtex high explosives. It had fully detonated.

Last week the Catholic church backed an amendment to legislation put forward by a Labour MSP, stressing the importance of marriage. The amendment was rejected earlier this week by a committee of MSPs. The executive plans to replace section 28 with a clause highlighting the value of \"stable family life\" and has tough ened guidelines covering sex education. \"They have given me the impression that there is a very liberal agenda, and come hell or high water they are going to see it through,\" said Cardinal Winning. Responding to the remarks, the deputy first minister, Jim Wallace, said that the cardinal was entitled to his own views, but the executive believed it had made clear efforts to address concerns over repeal and to strengthen guidelines on sex education.",

Mindful of the enormous influence the religious parties exercise on Israel's coalition politics, members of Ehud Barak's government rallied to their side. \"I think the court has made an erroneous decision,\" said Michael Melchior, the minister of diaspora affairs. \"We cannot solve our problems by making either side make painful concessions. For many people in our society this decision is against the basic primordial order of things. It will bring violent confrontation instead of compromise.\" Women of the Wall, which represents some 110 women who conduct services at the shrine on the first day of each Jewish month, fear that Orthodox rabbis will lobby the supreme court to review its verdict. Although Women of the Wall pray in the Orthodox fashion, never enter the male preserve and only put on prayer shawls or read aloud from Torah scrolls at some distance from the shrine, they have been regularly abused by Orthodox male worshippers - and occasionally attacked. \"We are threatening the total control men have over religious life in Israel,\" said Ms Hoffman. \"How could a group of women praying possibly be sacrilegious?\"",

      "bodyText": "Luxembourg police yesterday stormed a creche and shot a lone, heavily-armed gunman who had held 25 children and three adults hostage for more than 30 hours. A police spokesman said the man, who was carrying a pistol, a knife and a hand grenade, had agreed to be interviewed on television. As he left the building with two hostages, he was shot by a detective disguised as a cameraman. \"We set up a little interview and this allowed us to approach the hostage taker and neutralise him,\" he said. The prime minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the hostage taker had demanded to flee in a car with three hostages, forcing police to move in. The gunman was seriously injured but all the hostages, many of whom were under four years old, were released unharmed. The siege began when the gunman - who locals claim is a Tunisian national whose own children once attended the day care centre - walked into the building and took more than 40 adults and children hostage. He freed 17 of the hostages on Wednesday and a further four yesterday morning but it became obvious that he would not drop his demand that a plane should fly him to Libya. The 39-year-old gunman had a history of mental problems and police used his own psychologist as a go-between in negotiations. Locals in Wasserbillig, a small town with a population of 2,300 on the German border, claim that the man was motivated by a profound hatred of the day care centre staff, whom he blamed for the fact that his own two children were taken away from him by social services after he separated from his wife. The man had earlier set a deadline of 8.30am for him to be taken to a nearby airport to be flown to Libya. That ultimatum passed without incident. Police also did not confirm reports that the man had demanded $1m to release the hostages. Meanwhile, marksmen surrounded the day care centre, backed by members of the German special forces. Thirteen of the children were of Portuguese nationality and Portugal's ambassador to Luxembourg also offered his assistance to police. The interior minister later confirmed that a jet had been waiting at Luxembourg airport, as per the gunman's demands. A volley of gun shots rang out and it was over. A police helicopter hovered over the day care centre and the waiting emergency services sprang into action. Some of the onlookers gave a muted cheer as it became clear that the hostages had been freed without injury. Yesterday was a bank holiday in Luxembourg and was supposed to be a day of relaxation for the inhabitants of Wasserbillig.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong's senior leaders finally rebelled yesterday against unwanted Chinese advice by openly accusing a mainland official of \"interference\" in the territory's affairs. The storm followed a speech on Wednesday by He Zhiming, a vice-director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong, who warned local businessmen not to trade with Taiwanese companies which support independence. Mr He said that anyone doing so was \"taking a risk\" and would have to \"face the consequences.\" His words were seen as a threat to Hong Kong's much-prized business autonomy. The chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, yesterday moved quickly to get the offending remarks repudiated by a more senior Hong Kong-based Beijing official. Mr Tung told reporters that he had secured a pledge from Jiang Enzhu, Mr He's immediate superior, that China \"will not interfere with business here\". Mr Tung's deputy, chief secretary Anson Chan, also issued a statement refuting Mr He's remarks, which she said had caused widespread concern. \"In our view\", she concluded, \"business decisions are best left to businessmen and should not invite the interference of any official of whatever status.\" Both Mr Tung and his deputy have tried to avoid open controversy with Beijing officials until now, although Ms Chan has expressed veiled disapproval. Last month Wang Fengchao, a colleague of Mr He in the liaison office, warned the Hong Kong media not to print views advocating Taiwanese independence. His warning was supported by senior officials in Beijing. Mr Tung and Ms Chan then gave assurances that Hong Kong's press freedom was not in doubt, but avoided directly criticising Mr Wang. By stirring up alarm in the business community, Mr He appears to have overstepped the mark. Mr Tung's natural constituency lies in the business world and his family shipping company has had extensive dealings in Taiwan. A legislator, James Tien, who represents the Hong Kong general chamber of commerce, said that business people, \"will simply look at each business deal to see whether it is profitable, rather than asking the trading partners about their political views\".

As part of an Economic and Social Research Council programme on the state of democracy in the United Kingdom we have been examining participation. We asked people to assess the likelihood of their voting at the next general election on a scale from one to ten. Some 71% were categorised as likely voters (with a rating from eight to ten), which is fairly close to the proportion who actually did turn out in 1997.</p> <p>If we compare the size of this group of likely voters across the parties, clear differences emerge in the relationship between support and voting intention. Interestingly enough the nationalists have the most determined backers. Some 94% of their supporters fall into this \"likely to vote\" group.

Labour, in contrast, came a clear fourth with only 80% of their supporters in the likely to vote category.</p> <p>Differences in willingness to vote have clear electoral effects as can be seen by applying these proportions to the results of the Guardian/ ICM poll published on May 16. The table sums it up. Labour's lead over the Tories in that survey was 7%. If we adjust the figures for differences in the likelihood that people will vote, according to our model Labour's lead has to be cut to 3%. The adjusted figures include non-voters (those who we assessed as unlikely to turn out). They expressed a party preference to interviewers but most of them are unlikely to translate that preference into a cross on a ballot paper one bright morn in May 2001 or whenever.</p> <p>These figures tell us why Labour cannot translate the poll leads it keeps chalking up into victories in real contests. To be fair, there are other recent polls which give Labour a larger lead over the Tories than the Guardian/ ICM survey. But the same need for adjustment applies to them too, namely that polls need to be tempered for the willingness of electors to turn out and vote - if we are to get an accurate picture of the standing of the parties in actual elections.</p> <p>The evidence also shows clearly how big a problem Labour has in its heartlands. In the southeast of England outside London, some 82% of respondents fall into the \"likely to vote\" category. In Leeds and Hull they are lethargic. In Yorkshire and Humberside only 65% are in this category. A similar point can be made about Scotland with 75% likely to vote; in the northwest of England 73% are in this group. An extra discount has to be applied to parliamentary seats in these regions because the Tories who live there appear to be more willing to vote than Labour supporters. As a consequence Labour is more likely to lose marginal seats in these areas than in other parts of the country. Since there is also a tendency for working-class people to turn out less than white collar workers, class and geography combine to reduce Labour support in these areas.</p> <p>Why is this happening? The most popular explanation is that differential turnout reflects disaffection with New Labour's delivery of policies, particularly in relation to the NHS and education.

      "bodyText": "Rodney Ledward was greeted as \"a breath of fresh air\" when he first arrived at the William Harvey Hospital at Ashford, Kent, in January 1980. A flamboyant character with an impeccable track record and a glowing CV, the gynaecologist looked set for a glittering career and was even described by a former patient as \"very dashing, quite the Women's Weekly Hero\". He was regarded by his colleagues in Ashford as an eccentric character, who regularly arrived for consultations wearing riding boots and jodhpurs, and occasionally gave his patients carnations. But in the inquiry report published yesterday, he was criticised for arrogance, lack of compassion and his \"intimidating and frightening\" manner with patients and junior staff, whom he regularly \"belittled\". He claimed to be \"the fastest gynaecologist in the south-east\" after he performed seven hysterectomies in three hours and 40 minutes. It was this attention to the speed rather than the quality of his work which led to his downfall - and to that of the hundreds of women he treated in the 16 years he worked at the William Harvey. Mr Ledward obtained a degree in pharmacy in 1959 before becoming a mature medical student, but after a series of house officer, senior house officer and registrar jobs at hospitals across Britain, he was appointed senior registrar at the City and Women's hospital in Nottingham and clinical teacher at Nottingham university in 1975. He was also seconded to the Riyadh military hospital in Saudi Arabia in 1979, months before joining the William Harvey. During his years in Kent he reaped lucrative fees for his extensive private work, based at various private hospitals, including St Saviour's clinic in Hythe. Now 62 and living alone in Ireland, Mr Ledward has never made any secret of his love of the high life. He has a \u00a3750,000 bungalow and stud farm in County Cork, and a Rolls-Royce. His careless attitude was evident even before Mr Ledward moved to Kent, according to the inquiry team chaired by Jean Ritchie, QC. \"There was something slapdash and unmethodical in his character; an element of seeing what he could get away with,\" the report said. Concerned GPs were said to have had deep worries about Mr Ledward early on, but most \"tended to bury their heads in the sand\". By 1991 there was ample evidence that something was terribly wrong with his work but junior doctors and nursing staff were reluctant to speak out in a \"closed and closet atmosphere where there was and probably still is a culture of junior doctors being reluctant to criticise their seniors\". A nurse who planned to speak to the inquiry was told by her colleagues: \"More fool you.\" \"It is our impression that everyone hoped that someone else would deal with Rodney Ledward,\" the report concluded, something which they blamed in part on his powerful and stubborn personality. \"We found the analogy with Mr Toad very graphic,\" the inquiry team noted. Although hundreds of patients have come forward to complain about Mr Ledward since he was struck off by the General Medical Council in 1998, only a handful of women complained at the time of their treatment. Most thought they had just been unlucky, while many simply did not know how or to whom to complain, and others were too embarrassed to discuss intimate problems such as incontinence. Yet, despite the huge number of complications, \"it never seems to have crossed his mind that there was anything amiss with his technique. He seems to have been supremely confident in his abilities and actions,\" the report found. His self-belief was not even shaken in 1993 when he was dismissed from his contracts at two private hospitals in Kent - the Buckland hospital in Dover, and the Chaucer private hospital in Canterbury - following complaints from patients. It was not until 1996 that his colleagues at Ashford finally blew the whistle on Mr Ledward when they were unable to contact him as a patient he had treated lay bleeding to death. Even after he was struck off by the GMC for gross professional misconduct, some staff closest to him claimed he was the \"victim of a vendetta\". Nevertheless, the Ritchie report, ordered in March 1999 by the then health secretary Frank Dobson, raised serious concerns not only about Mr Ledward's medical skills but also his surgical practice, accusing him of pressurising NHS patients to go private, asking patients to bring cash with them when they were admitted for surgery and having a cold and bullying attitude. Among the litany of complaints against him were numerous cases of rushed and incompetent surgery, in which he repeatedly made mistakes that surgeons would normally expect to make only once or twice in their entire careers, numerous unnecessary operations, and damage to patients' bladders, kidneys and livers, about which they were never told. The report also notes compaints about Mr Ledward's brutality in internal examinations - some of which were undertaken without gloves - and routine belittling of patients. A woman was pressurised to have a caesarean birth five weeks early because he was going on holiday. She refused and went on to bear a healthy child. Another was attended by Ledward in riding clothes. Tapping his boots with a riding crop, he suggested her post-operative complications were her own fault and asked: \"Who's a naughty girl then?\" A woman of 22 was told she had cancer which would kill her in six months if she did not have a hysterectomy. The operation was carried out but, the report says, there was no evidence that she had cancer. Officials at East Kent NHS trust yesterday apologised to Mr Ledward's former patients, insisting that the lessons of his case had been learned. But Mr Ledward, who gave only written evidence because he is reported to be suffering from terminal prostate cancer, was travelling to Spain for a holiday, insisting - as he has all along - that he has done nothing wrong.",

She said: \"I personally think Ledward belongs in prison. I think he is mentally unbalanced, someone who gets satisfaction from the power he has over women. At first I trusted him. It was only when his case became known that I realised what had been done to me.\" Brenda Johnson , 53, of Folkestone, has suffered constant pain and bladder problems since she was operated on by Ledward. She went to him in 1981 with a bladder problem and he told her she needed a hysterectomy. Later she discovered there was a less drastic alternative. Ledward's procedure left her bleeding \"all day and all night\". She had to undergo a \"brutal emergency operation\" to save her life. She has not worked since. Mrs Johnson, who helped found the victim support group, said: \"They call for strong managers and better management - so what have they got now, a bunch of idiots? This man destroyed lives and there was a big 16-year cover up.\" Ann Dowling , 60, from Dover, Kent, was left with a hole in her bladder after Ledward let junior doctors perform her hysterectomy at the William Harvey hospital in 1984. Despite four more operations since then, she has remained incontinent as a result of the bungled first operation. Mrs Dowling said: \"I thought Ledward would do the operation, as it was major surgery and supposed to be done by a consultant, but he left it to a junior doctor. It has ruined my life. I was left in pain and unable to work for 11 years.\" She was critical of his attitude. \"Ledward used to sweep through the ward like a god. It was as if he was saying: 'Who are you to ask me questions?' When I went back to him after the operation and said I had problems, he just said it was normal and dismissed me with a wave of his hands.\"",

The British Medical Association's annual consultants' conference unanimously passed a motion of no confidence in the GMC, the profession's regulatory body, as it is at present constituted and functioning. Delegates accused the GMC, made up of elected doctors and members of the public appointed by the Privy Council, of pandering to the media and politicians by making kneejerk responses and failing to convey a positive image of the profession. Peter Hawker, chairman of the central consultants and specialists committee, said it was time the GMC \"reformed itself and reformed itself radically\". He accused the GMC of failing to protect patients or to guide doctors. The GMC has been under fire for some time because of the length of time it takes to adjudicate on cases brought against doctors. Speaking against the motion Sir Denis Pereira-Gray, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the move would divide the British medical profession for the first time since the 19th century by splitting hospital doctors from GPs. As expected, the hospital consultants rejected proposals for a new grade of specialist doctor to work alongside consultants.

In a speech to the National Association of Head Teachers conference in Jersey, Mr Blunkett pledged to deal with most of a raft of complaints raised by delegates this week, unveiling plans to reduce council control of budgets, promising a \"levelling up\" of school funding across the country and launching a war on red tape. In response to an NAHT claim that heads were being forced to take back violent pupils against their will, Mr Blunkett said he was considering new instructions to independent appeal panels not to override heads when pupils had been excluded for \"violence or the threat of severe violence\". His recent call to this effect had not \"entirely filtered through.\" But he was confident that new guidance would not affect his campaign to reduce exclusions by a third by 2002 from their present level of 12,000. Mr Blunkett said his proposal to separate school and local education authority budgets \"would cut away the undergrowth and ensure that every penny is spent on teachers and training\". Local education authorities take between 20p and 30p in every \u00a31 for education. But under Mr Blunkett's plan LEAs would be left with \"a bare minimum\" role.

It is not a banned substance, although its effects can be stronger than alcohol. Angry scowls that had been a feature of most of the rebels' faces for the past 10 days were replaced by cheerful grins; taunts and obscenities gave way to traditional, albeit slurred, folk songs. In several hours of talks with Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the commander of Fiji's armed forces, who on Monday declared martial law, Mr Speight first secured his three initial demands: that the prime minister be replaced; the constitution torn up; and an amnesty for him and his lieutenants. Then the 44-year-old former insurance executive wrung the key promise out of Cmdr Bainimarama that is likely to lead to the release of the 30-odd hostages, including the ousted ethnic Indian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry.

But yesterday he warned that his attempts to improve the lot of the educationally disadvantaged were at risk because his respected research unit faced extinction in four months unless it received more funding.</p> <p>\"It would be a tragedy if this were to happen just as we are about to make a real impact on reading problems and a waste of my life for the last 10 years\" he said. \"We have already proved that there is a relationship between children's basic auditory and visual functioning and how they learn to read.</p> <p>\"The next step we have planned is a pilot which would involve tests for primary schools to alert them to particular reading problems\".</p> <p>He said there were already signs of interest from some American universities. \"They are starting to take note of what we are doing in the UK\" .</p> <p>The Dyslexia Research Trust had been hoping to set up a new research centre at Oxford to take the work forward, but had failed to secure funding, he added. The project has been financed by the Wellcome Trust for the past 15 years but the funding is not being renewed.</p> <p>The Department for Education and Employment said Prof Stein had submitted an application for funding two years ago, but as the project at that stage related to the causes of dyslexia, it was seen as an issue for the Department of Health.</p> <p>Prof Stein launched his counter-attack in a letter to the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>The professor, who educated his two daughters at state schools, said yesterday that he had voted Labour at the last election and still broadly supported \"most of what they are trying to do\".</p> <p>Yesterday the British Dyslexia Association said his work was invaluable and should be continued.</p> <p>The leader of the Lords, Lady Jay, yesterday continued the government's assault on Oxbridge elitism with an appeal to American graduates of Oxford and Cambridge to help their former universities reach out to students from all social backgrounds.</p> <p>The two universities still had a \"long way to go\" before they could claim to offer access based on merit, she told a dinner in Washington. Both had to learn from American institutions like Harvard and Yale to reach out to less privileged groups of potential students.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A pioneering research programme to help youngsters overcome dyslexia and other early reading problems is facing extinction because of lack of cash, the don at the centre of the \"elitist\" university row warned yesterday. John Stein, professor of physiology at Magdalen College, Oxford, hit back at ministers and said the real scandal was their failure to support efforts - including his own - to help educationally disadvantaged pupils get into Oxbridge. Prof Stein, who was behind the university's rejection of the oustanding comprehensive pupil Laura Spence, said he felt he had been publicly insulted by chancellor Gordon Brown's claims that he had discriminated against state sector applicants. He also criticised the education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, and former school standards minister, Stephen Byers, for showing a \"polite interest\" in his summer school pro gramme for state school pupils, before giving him the \"runaround\" for two years and failing to give him any cash to finance it. The scientist is an authority on the diagnosis and treatment of early reading problems, including dyslexia. But yesterday he warned that his attempts to improve the lot of the educationally disadvantaged were at risk because his respected research unit faced extinction in four months unless it received more funding. \"It would be a tragedy if this were to happen just as we are about to make a real impact on reading problems and a waste of my life for the last 10 years\" he said. \"We have already proved that there is a relationship between children's basic auditory and visual functioning and how they learn to read. \"The next step we have planned is a pilot which would involve tests for primary schools to alert them to particular reading problems\". He said there were already signs of interest from some American universities. \"They are starting to take note of what we are doing in the UK\" . The Dyslexia Research Trust had been hoping to set up a new research centre at Oxford to take the work forward, but had failed to secure funding, he added. The project has been financed by the Wellcome Trust for the past 15 years but the funding is not being renewed. The Department for Education and Employment said Prof Stein had submitted an application for funding two years ago, but as the project at that stage related to the causes of dyslexia, it was seen as an issue for the Department of Health. Prof Stein launched his counter-attack in a letter to the Daily Telegraph. The professor, who educated his two daughters at state schools, said yesterday that he had voted Labour at the last election and still broadly supported \"most of what they are trying to do\". Yesterday the British Dyslexia Association said his work was invaluable and should be continued. The leader of the Lords, Lady Jay, yesterday continued the government's assault on Oxbridge elitism with an appeal to American graduates of Oxford and Cambridge to help their former universities reach out to students from all social backgrounds. The two universities still had a \"long way to go\" before they could claim to offer access based on merit, she told a dinner in Washington. Both had to learn from American institutions like Harvard and Yale to reach out to less privileged groups of potential students.",

      "bodyText": "A naked man wielding a samurai sword tried to kill members of a south London church congregation after hearing voices telling him they were demons in human form, a jury at the Old Bailey was told yesterday. Eleven worshippers were left seriously injured after Eden Strang, 26, attacked them with the three foot sword at St Andrew's Roman Catholic Church in Thornton Heath last November. Strang, who is unemployed, was overcome only after members of the Sunday morning congregation bravely tackled him with a crucifix and an organ pipe, the court heard. He was restrained by five men who sat on top of him until police arrived. Nicholas Hilliard, prosecuting, told the jury that Strang had been seen by two psychiatrists. Both were of the view that he was insane at the time of the incident. He said there was no dispute between the crown and the defence that Strang had carried out the offences. But it was for the jury to decide whether he was not guilty on grounds of insanity. Mr Hilliard told the court that the defendant was suffering from schizophrenia and that voices told him to go and attack the people in the church. \"He was suffering insane delusions that the people he was attacking were not human beings but demons, evil spirits, who had taken on human form.\" Strang, of Thornton Heath, has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of attempted murder, three of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two of inflicting grievous bodily harm, and one of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The court heard that he left his home close to the church on the morning of November 28, carrying the sword and a knife. He first attacked Paul Chilton, 50, who was waiting outside the church, raising the sword in both hands before bringing it down and delivering criss-cross blows. The thumb and a finger on Mr Chilton's right hand were severed as he raised his hands to try to defend himself. Strang then moved inside the church and began attacking members of the congregation. Among those injured were 83-year-old Margaret Sharp. The assault caused a cut in her back and left her with a collapsed left lung. Margaret Lucas, 66, who is partially deaf and walks with the aid of a walking frame, also suffered injuries. Mr Hilliard said that after she was taken to hospital it was revealed that her shoulder bone had been completely shattered. Strang who had also cut himself, was taken to Bromley hospital to have his cuts stitched. \"He was asked by a nurse why he had done it. He replied: 'I passed judgment. The good book says thou shalt not worship false idols'.\" In a statement read by Nadine Radford QC, defending, Strang's wife Michelle said they met while he was studying business at Paisley University and they had a young daughter. He had been made redundant from his computer job in June 1999 and had taken to spending the day in bed reading the Bible, as well as spending hours on his computer. She said Strang had had a tragic life. His stepfather had taken an overdose and died in front of him when he was 11, and his drug addict mother had died of Aids a year later. He was bought up by his grandmother in Glasgow and said he had been stabbed three times there, the first time when he was 15, and had nearly died as a result. Mrs Strang said her husband had talked of taking her away from \"Satan's world\" and on another occasion that he was married to God. The trial continues.",

The Tokyo-based holding company - which is one of the world's biggest e-investors - announced that it had sold 3.1m shares in the American internet portal Yahoo! for a $336m (\u00a3225m) profit. Although the shares represent only 2.5% of Softbank's total stake in Yahoo!, the unloading of stock in one of the few undisputed money-spinners in the company's portfolio raises fresh doubts about Mr Son's ability to generate sufficient revenues to keep his business on an even keel. Largely thanks to the strength of its holdings in Yahoo!, Softbank has been able to invest in more than 400 internet start-up companies around the world. By nurturing these young businesses Mr Son has said his aim is to build an internet corporation that will soar in value when the firms are ready for public stock flotations. \"Our company is a bet on the internet,\" he has boasted. This strategy helped Soft bank's stock soar twentyfold in the 12 months until February, when Mr Son appeared ready to overtake Bill Gates as the world's richest man. The worldwide collapse of the internet bubble, however, has hit the Japanese-Korean tycoon harder than most, and his empire is now contracting fast. Yesterday, Softbank's stock price was \u00a517,200, less than a tenth of its peak. Its profits last year were 70% down and it is believed to have been forced to sell off assets to stay liquid. But there is a limit to how quickly Softbank can unwind. The company has promised to hold on to many of its shares for six months. A further brake is that overseas sales would result in punishing taxes of up to 60%. In another sign that Mr Son is scaling down his ambitions, Softbank appears to be pulling back from a proposed buy-out of the Nippon Credit Bank. On Wednesday the government said it would no longer give a Softbank-led consortium exclusive rights to negotiate for the nationalised bank. The two sides had failed to hammer out a deal despite an extended deadline. Mr Son - whose Korean background has always made him something of an outsider in Japan's conservative business world - is said to have hoped the purchase of such an institution would boost his prestige among Japan's business establishment. He intended to convert Nippon Credit into an internet bank that would be positioned at the heart of his conglomerate and offer seed funding to start-up companies. With the government's latest announcement that dream is fading fast. Yesterday evening Japanese newspapers were suggesting that survival was now Mr Son's priority: \"Anxieties over possible collapse of Softbank,\" read one headline.

      "bodyText": "Elvis Presley has been claimed as Russian, Japanese, Irish and Scottish - and now, according to a lecturer at Cardiff University, clear evidence exists that he was Welsh. Terry Breverton, who teaches business studies at Cardiff University, yesterday published an A to Z of Wales, and placed the dead singer's name confidently among the Ps. Mr Breverton identifies the rock star's ancestors not only as coming from the Presili hills but as having links with a nearby chapel dedicated to St Elvis, \"the only one known in Britain\". The claim places the singer high in the history of Ireland as well as Wales. St Elvis of Munster was the monk who baptised the Welsh patron saint, St David, at Porth Clais in 454 AD. \"Divine providence had brought St Elvis over from Ireland at that conjuncture,\" says the Catholic Encyclopaedia. Presley's fans have linked him with sainthood since hearing of his last words on his bathroom floor at Gracelands: \"This must be like what Jesus suffered.\" It was the death, they say, of a profoundly spiritual man \"ultimately exhausted by his merciless admirers\". Mr Breverton is not the singer's first academic champion. At a conference in Memphis last year Vernon Chadwick said: \"Many of Elvis's moves that were considered vulgar were in fact bodily expressions of religious exaltation that he learned growing up in church.\" But Mr Breverton is the first to link him with Wales. Other facts point to this, he says. \"His dead twin, Jesse Garon Presley, had a Welsh second name, and his mother Gladys had a Welsh name too. \"His grandmother Doll Mansell may have come from the famous family of Mansel from Oxwich on the Gower peninsula. \"Although most 'Elvisologists' believe that Elvis came from Scottish and Cherokee blood, further research would probably solidify the Welsh connection at the expense of the Scottish.\" The secretary of the Gower Society, Ruth Ridge, said she was amazed by the claim. \"It does not feature in society literature about Gower's history. \"We will be appealing for help to see if there is any truth in the claims,\" she added. \"It would be wonderful if there was.\"",

      "bodyText": "A woman believed to have been murdered and buried in the garden by her husband, was found dead 4,000 miles away in the Venezuelan forest, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. Chigusa Turner, 32, had been lured to Caracas in June last year by her occupational therapist husband Ray, 29, alleged David Farrer QC, prosecuting. Mr Turner then strangled her, wrapped her in black plastic binliners he had packed from their home in Willesden, north-west London, hid her in a suitcase and dumped her in a wood, Mr Farrer said. Turner and his alleged accomplice, Danny Draghici, 32, then returned to London believing the body would never be found or identified. But Venezuelan police found it within a week and it was eventually identified from dental records after Mrs Turner's family launched a search for her, said Mr Farrer. Meanwhile, Mr Turner, who also worked as a showbiz bodyguard, had installed his Korean mistress in the flat and was withdrawing money from his wife's bank accounts. In August, before the body was linked to Britain, police arrested Mr Turner, initially for stealing from the accounts but later rearrested him for suspected murder. Mr Farrer said: \"Police searched the ground-floor flat, digging in the garden, pulling up floors. Obviously, they were contemplating the possibility that she was dead and buried at their home in London.\" But the police were, in fact, \"4,000 miles wide of the mark\", he said. Mr Turner pleaded not guilty to murdering his Japanese-born wife by strangling her shortly after she arrived in Caracas on June 3, and to conspiracy to murder - a charge also denied by his Romanian friend, Mr Draghici. Both men had travelled to Venezuela together and had been jointly involved in the killing, Mr Farrer said. After their arrests, they blamed each other for the death. Mr Draghici, of Crawley, West Sussex, said Mr Turner had returned from the airport claiming that his wife had never arrived. Mr Turner told officers \"an utterly bizarre\" story in which he claimed he had been beaten up by Venezuelan police, robbed at gunpoint and returned to the Hilton hotel in Caracas to find Mr Draghici with his wife's blood-covered body. Mr Farrer said Mrs Turner had not been seen after she arrived at the airport. Mr Turner had given various explanations for her not returning home, he said, and had forged her signature on a resignation letter to the Japanese Tourist Board where she worked. But the pair appeared not to have allowed for the curiosity and suspicion that her absence aroused in her family and friends, he said. The woman's father and brother travelled to London and contacted police after finding Mr Turner's mistress, Nak Sim-choi, in the flat. The case continues.",

A number of sites have been set up offering tickets at inflated prices, and trading standards officers and tournament organisers have warned that they will monitor the situation and take action against anyone caught selling tickets. Authorities in Holland and Belgium have introduced legislation to deal with ticket touts, and all fans will be required to carry identification when they attend the matches. A number of sellers in Holland are to face prosecution as tournament organisers try to ensure that tickets do not end up on the black market. A spokesman for Euro 2000 said: \"We will be writing to any company in England that is selling tickets warning them that we will take legal action. We have a very strict ticket policy that is designed to ensure safety within grounds. \"We are aware that a large number of tickets are being offered for sale via the internet, and we will be working with authorities around Europe to try to stop it.\" Around 1.2m tickets have been sold, and for the first time organisers have said that the majority of tickets would be set aside for genuine fans.",

      "bodyText": "Scottish Power, Britain's biggest energy group, yesterday became the latest power company to back down in the face of threatened industrial action and scrapped plans to axe 300 engineering jobs over the next three years under a cost-saving programme. The Glasgow-based group is also set to back down on a further 150 redundancies among clerical staff under the same programme to save \u00a375m in operating costs in its heavily regulated electricity distribution business. Unions led by the AEEU and TGWU hailed the move as the latest climbdown by power groups seeking widespread changes in staffing levels and employment contracts in order to counteract the squeeze on prices imposed by regulators. Northern Electric made a similar move last year. The AEEU said it had won 90% backing in a ballot for a series of three-day strikes at Scottish Power this month and next in protest at the planned voluntary redundancies and changes to contracts of employment, including a cut in holiday entitlement by five days and no sick pay for the first three days of illness. Dougie Rooney, AEEU energy officer, said: \"This is a victory for common sense. We have avoided confrontation and now have an opportunity to work in partnership.\" Union sources added: \"We always argue that you can't guarantee safety and security of supply if you suddenly sack this number of staff.\" The planned cuts in a workforce of 4,000 would have affected staff in both southern Scotland and north-west England and north Wales, where the group owns electricity company Manweb. But company officials said the cost-saving remained on track and would be achieved by union agreement to greater efficiency, productivity and flexibility as the group tried to retain its leading position in the UK sector. Scottish Power is one of the rare utilities to continue to enjoy City favour, and last month announced a \u00a391m rise in pre-tax profits for 1999 to \u00a3736m. But following its $6.5bn acquisition of US power group PacifiCorp last year, it is increasingly looking overseas for future earnings growth.",

Fair enough, this sort of threadbare TV offal is the stock in trade of the abysmal Granada Men And Motors, with its gruesome parade of strippers, slags and slobbering beer-drinkers. But Granada M&amp;M is unrepentant late-night filler in the twilight zone of digital and cable, made on a shoestring and grateful for even totally pissed viewers unconscious in front of the TV, just as long as they've left the set switched on so it can count as a statistic. </p> <p>By contrast, Something For The Weekend obviously has money spent on it (not least on Denise's fee), and clearly imagines itself to be in the vanguard of a lad-tastic style-wave.

      "body": "<p>I am a 37-year-old single man with a well-paid job and excellent prospects. My problem is that I have been betrayed by two women and I can't understand why.</p> <p>Until seven months ago I was involved for five years with a girl much younger than me. During this time I paid her rent, paid off her debts, bought her expensive jewellery and got her a good job - only to find that she was sleeping with her ex-boyfriend. I was devastated but feel that she should pay me back. She has refused.</p> <p>I met the second woman at a conference. She is 31 and was engaged to another man. I thought I had found someone special, but she said that although she liked me, she wanted to stay with her fianc\u00e9. She told me that if she split up with him she would go out with me. Last month, they did just that, but she now says that she is not interested in me.</p> <p>I have a lot of money and everything to offer but have been let down twice and it's tearing me apart. What should I do?</p> <p><b> Open your eyes</b><br></p> <p>This may sound harsh, but I suspect you had an idea that your ex-girlfriend was still involved with her former boyfriend. But, at the time, the relationship was working for both of you, so you turned a blind eye. I also think you should ask yourself why you become attracted to younger and obviously unavailable women. What do you hope to gain from such liaisons? I also became involved with an older man whose idea of commitment was to offer to pay my rent. Believe it or not, it wasn't his money I was after. After several months I called it off and, yes, I did return to my former boyfriend. <br><b>Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> No strings attached</b><br></p> <p>Your problem is not that you have been betrayed. It is that your love in both the cases you mention has been conditional. You tried to buy the love of your much younger girlfriend. By paying off her debts, by giving her expensive jewellery and by paying her rent you felt that she owed you something. She didn't.</p> <p>In your second relationship your love was also conditional and was again bound to fail. I am sure that you do have \"everything to offer\", but until it is given without strings attached I am sure no one will take it up. <br><b>Sheila K Madhvani</b><br>London</p> <p><b> It's not about money</b><br></p> <p>Finding the right partner is not about having \"excellent prospects\" or having \"everything to offer\" materially. If you try and base your relationships on material concerns alone, you will only attract materialists - people who will take you for a ride and give you little in return.

      "bodyText": "I am a 37-year-old single man with a well-paid job and excellent prospects. My problem is that I have been betrayed by two women and I can't understand why. Until seven months ago I was involved for five years with a girl much younger than me. During this time I paid her rent, paid off her debts, bought her expensive jewellery and got her a good job - only to find that she was sleeping with her ex-boyfriend. I was devastated but feel that she should pay me back. She has refused. I met the second woman at a conference. She is 31 and was engaged to another man. I thought I had found someone special, but she said that although she liked me, she wanted to stay with her fianc\u00e9. She told me that if she split up with him she would go out with me. Last month, they did just that, but she now says that she is not interested in me. I have a lot of money and everything to offer but have been let down twice and it's tearing me apart. What should I do? Open your eyes This may sound harsh, but I suspect you had an idea that your ex-girlfriend was still involved with her former boyfriend. But, at the time, the relationship was working for both of you, so you turned a blind eye. I also think you should ask yourself why you become attracted to younger and obviously unavailable women. What do you hope to gain from such liaisons? I also became involved with an older man whose idea of commitment was to offer to pay my rent. Believe it or not, it wasn't his money I was after. After several months I called it off and, yes, I did return to my former boyfriend. Name and address withheld No strings attached Your problem is not that you have been betrayed. It is that your love in both the cases you mention has been conditional. You tried to buy the love of your much younger girlfriend. By paying off her debts, by giving her expensive jewellery and by paying her rent you felt that she owed you something. She didn't. In your second relationship your love was also conditional and was again bound to fail. I am sure that you do have \"everything to offer\", but until it is given without strings attached I am sure no one will take it up. Sheila K Madhvani London It's not about money Finding the right partner is not about having \"excellent prospects\" or having \"everything to offer\" materially. If you try and base your relationships on material concerns alone, you will only attract materialists - people who will take you for a ride and give you little in return. And it sounds as if the first girl you mention was certainly one of these. It's an age-old cliche, but all the money and prospects in the world won't buy you love or affection. You may have money to throw about, but that doesn't mean you automatically deserve a girlfriend. A woman is not a trophy, to be won by the most eligible and wealthy competitor. You also seem to have unfair expectations of the women you meet socially and, I hate to say it, an overblown sense of your own importance. The woman you met at the conference did not betray you.

If you want a true, fulfilling relationship, you should begin by treating the women you meet as people, rather than potential rewards for what you consider to be your own material and professional success.

Remember: a mature women with her own income and independence is unlikely to be attracted to someone who believes that buying her the occasional flash gift gives him sole rights over the way she lives her life. I wish you luck. Jane Wright London Spend, spend, spend I understand how frustrating it must be that, despite your obvious ability and willingness to pay for a loving and devoted partner, these two women have failed to keep their part of the bargain.

      "bodyText": "Tension was high in Montenegro yesterday after a security adviser and close friend of the Yugoslav republic's pro-western president was assassinated outside his home. Police roadblocks throughout the capital failed to catch the gunman who ambushed Goran Zugic, 39, late on Wednesday night outside his home in the capital, Podgorica. It was the first Serbia-style assassination in the country and comes ahead of crucial elections in the towns of Herceg Novi and Podgorica that are viewed as a vital test of the pro-west and pro-Belgrade forces in the republic. The murder of Zugic is a blow to the president, Milo Djukanovic. Zugic was one of his closest friends, and was best man at his wedding. A gunman with an automatic weapon shot Zugic in the head a number of times at 11pm on Wednesday night. Police sealed off the area soon after and have declared that they will try their utmost to solve the killing. \"It was a classic politically motivated assassination with all the characteristics of a series of murders in Serbia,\" said Rifat Rastoder, deputy speaker of Montenegro's parliament. \"It is a direct and desperate attempt to transfer Serbia's shotgun policies to Montenegro and create conditions for the imposition of a state of emergency and dictatorship\" by [Yugoslav president Slobodan] Milosevic's regime, Mr Rastoder added. Mr Djukanovic is at odds with Mr Milosevic. Montenegro is seeking autonomy or outright independence from Yugoslavia because of Mr Milosevic's autocratic policies. Montenegro's opposition leader, Miroslav Vickovic, said that in both Serbia and Montenegro \"the thin line between politics and crime has disappeared\". In Serbia, the Milosevic administration yesterday took over a municipal bus company in the opposition-controlled capital. The decision to take away the Belgrade City Transport company from the hands of the municipal authorities followed a four-day strike by private carriers which brought public transport in the capital to a virtual halt. A government statement on the takeover carried on the official Tanjug news agency said: \"The total collapse of public transport in Belgrade has jeopardised living and working conditions of all the citizens, as well as the functioning of enterprises, schools and hospitals.\" The takeover is part of an ongoing campaign by Mr Milosevic's government to discredit the opposition ahead of Serbia's municipal elections, due by the end of the year. The victims of gangland-style killings in Serbia this year include the warlord Zeljko \"Arkan\" Raznatovic; the defence minister, Pavle Bulatovic; the head of Yugoslav Airlines and a close ally of Mr Milosevic, Zika Petrovic; and a senior official of the ruling party, Bosko Perosevic. According to the Belgrade daily Danas, Zugic was born in Montenegro but grew up in Bosnia and Herzegovina and was a police officer there before returning home in 1992. He was made chief of police in Herceg Novi and in 1995 took up the same post in Podgorica. The elections there are to be held on June 11. His death follows statements by officials of Montenegro's pro-Belgrade opposition party that Mr Milosevic would visit the small Yugoslav republic. Few believe that will happen, but one analyst said the reports had destablised Montenegro because it highlighted the vulnerability of Mr Djukanovic's party's pro-western wing. It would be virtually impossible to arrest Mr Milosevic, he said, without triggering massive turmoil.",

I was accompanying young Peter, a former academic colleague of mine in the Open University and arguably one of the best living authorities on the witchcraft trials of earlier centuries. He has real world skills too - he can competently relief manage a betting shop. He had arranged a match against two old friends of his who are members of the Pennard club. </p> <p>Although I have visited and enjoyed the area before, with its raised beaches and interesting geology, the course was entirely new to me - I had to be pointed in the right direction on every tee. However, I have played enough links courses, notably in Ulster, to know what to expect in the form of blind drives over sand hills and tight lies even if you can consistently stay on fairways. I suspect the local members thought we might be easy scalps and a fiver on the match was suggested and agreed on the first tee. </p> <p>At 62, and waiting still for my winter fuel payment, I struggle for length, but I do tend to keep it straight in a style often characterised as boring by those who are longer off the tee but in deep rough. So, when I recorded two birdies in the first four holes we were on our way to a surprising win over the local members by a convincing margin of ten Stableford points. My 39 was a score I have not matched at home for a long time so there must have been a lot of flukes in it. </p> <p>Our hosts graciously drew attention to the natural beauties of the links. The skylarks sang sweetly overhead and the burnet roses were just opening to release their fragrance. Residual mist closed in the views to Lundy and the north Devon coast which are the bonuses of this location, but the Pena Pill snaking across the sands as the tide came in glittered in the increasing sunlight. A lunchtime pint tasted extraordinarily agreeable, but then it would, would it not, after such an unlikely outcome to the morning's sport?</p>",

Although I have visited and enjoyed the area before, with its raised beaches and interesting geology, the course was entirely new to me - I had to be pointed in the right direction on every tee. However, I have played enough links courses, notably in Ulster, to know what to expect in the form of blind drives over sand hills and tight lies even if you can consistently stay on fairways. I suspect the local members thought we might be easy scalps and a fiver on the match was suggested and agreed on the first tee. At 62, and waiting still for my winter fuel payment, I struggle for length, but I do tend to keep it straight in a style often characterised as boring by those who are longer off the tee but in deep rough. So, when I recorded two birdies in the first four holes we were on our way to a surprising win over the local members by a convincing margin of ten Stableford points. My 39 was a score I have not matched at home for a long time so there must have been a lot of flukes in it. Our hosts graciously drew attention to the natural beauties of the links. The skylarks sang sweetly overhead and the burnet roses were just opening to release their fragrance. Residual mist closed in the views to Lundy and the north Devon coast which are the bonuses of this location, but the Pena Pill snaking across the sands as the tide came in glittered in the increasing sunlight. A lunchtime pint tasted extraordinarily agreeable, but then it would, would it not, after such an unlikely outcome to the morning's sport?",

Situations where sex workers cannot select their clients, nor decide what services they will give, and where exploitation is so severe that they are deprived of virtually all earnings cannot be addressed in law without decriminalisation. This would allow the setting of acceptable standards against which such unacceptable working conditions could be judged. To argue for further criminalisation of commercial sex to protect the vulnerable ignores the fact that current legislation - also intended to protect the vulnerable - does no such thing. Acceptance of sex work would allow those who are exploited to seek help without fear of being stigmatised, prosecuted or deported. Hilary Kinnell Europap-UK HKinnell@aol.com",

      "body": "<p>The sudden death of Professor Robert Carroll at the age of 59 has deprived the world of Hebrew biblical scholarship of one of its most gifted and imaginative members. His best-known work is his massive commentary on the Book of Jeremiah.</p> <p>Born in Dublin, a graduate of Trinity College, and always an Irishman, he nevertheless pursued his academic career in Scotland. After an Edinburgh PhD in 1967, he was appointed to an assistant lectureship at Glasgow University in 1968, and remained there, being appointed to a professorship in 1991. He could appear cynical and sardonic about university life, and hated committees, but he kept on being appointed to them, for his honesty and commitment were greatly valued by senior colleagues, non-academic staff and students alike.</p> <p>He was not a churchman, and there were many in the Church of Scotland who were doubtful whether their ministerial candidates should learn about the Bible from one of such unusual views. Some could not cope; but those who persevered recognised the importance of Robert's questioning and probing, and valued the contacts which he maintained for years after they had graduated. He would have been amused to be called a pastor - too churchy a word; but it was a genuine pastoral office that he exercised.

      "bodyText": "The sudden death of Professor Robert Carroll at the age of 59 has deprived the world of Hebrew biblical scholarship of one of its most gifted and imaginative members. His best-known work is his massive commentary on the Book of Jeremiah. Born in Dublin, a graduate of Trinity College, and always an Irishman, he nevertheless pursued his academic career in Scotland. After an Edinburgh PhD in 1967, he was appointed to an assistant lectureship at Glasgow University in 1968, and remained there, being appointed to a professorship in 1991. He could appear cynical and sardonic about university life, and hated committees, but he kept on being appointed to them, for his honesty and commitment were greatly valued by senior colleagues, non-academic staff and students alike. He was not a churchman, and there were many in the Church of Scotland who were doubtful whether their ministerial candidates should learn about the Bible from one of such unusual views. Some could not cope; but those who persevered recognised the importance of Robert's questioning and probing, and valued the contacts which he maintained for years after they had graduated. He would have been amused to be called a pastor - too churchy a word; but it was a genuine pastoral office that he exercised. The general assembly of the Church of Scotland is to acknowledge the care he took with students. His work on Jeremiah questioned the assumption that we can have access to the individual figure of the prophet; he saw the Book as in many ways fiction, using a life story to spell out a particular ideology to explain God's dealing with his people. But Robert wrote much more widely, challenging received assumptions, forcing his fellow scholars to think again. The range of his own reading was enormous: literary criticism, a range of philosophy, ancient and modern, fiction from different cultures. In the Cambridge Companion to Biblical Interpretation, he wrote on poststructural approaches: new historicism and postmodernism. His extensive bibliography contained nothing written by a member of the professional guild of biblical critics; Robert felt that their agenda was usually much too narrow. Nevertheless, he was appreciated by his fellows, and it was appropriate that the Society for Old Testament Study should invite him to become its president, an office he filled with quirky good humour in 1999. His work was mostly published by the SCM Press, and it was after a party to honour the retiring editor John Bowden, that he suffered a heart attack. He is survived by his wife, Mary Anne, two sons and a daughter. Richard Coggins Robert Carroll, Old Testament scholar, born January 18 1941; died May 12 2000",

He is survived by his wife, Diane, a daughter and two sons. Jack Schofield Donald Watts Davies, computer scientist, born June 7 1924; died May 28 2000",

He immersed himself in the culture of his adopted land, Rwanda, and ended up even more partisan than the locals. But in one painful way he is very different. His partisanship led him to join in a programme of genocide, and yesterday he began a 12-year jail sentence. Up to 800,000 people died in Rwanda between April and July 1994 in the massacres he helped to promote as a radio journalist, inciting the Hutus, whom he took as his own, to violence against the minority Tutsis. In the week before the carnage began, Ruggiu broadcast a typical tirade against the Tutsis. \"You cockroaches must know you are made of flesh. We won't let you kill. We will kill you,\" he said. The international criminal tribunal for Rwanda sentenced Ruggiu, 42, on two counts of directly and publicly inciting people to commit genocide in his broadcasts for Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines in Rwanda. There were mixed opinions yesterday on what lay behind his behaviour. Some who knew him described him as unhinged. International human rights groups, pleased to see the tribunal achieving results, were less forgiving, describing him as fully complicit in the genocide and stressing the influence his broadcasts had. Amnesty International's UK director, Kate Allen, said: \"Rwandese radio was a powerful tool for spreading genocidal hate and today's sentence demonstrates the international community's determination to send out its own message that systematic killing will not go unpunished.\" The judges had a more sympathetic explanation for his behaviour, portraying him as a weak individual whose infatuation made him easy for the Hutu leaders to manipulate. They told him: \"Your character is easily influenced by individuals who would take undue advantage of your idealism to involve you in a situation which led to the crimes for which you are convicted.\" Ruggiu was born in Verviers, south of Brussels, the youngest of four children of a Belgian mother and Italian father. He worked as a teacher of the mentally handicapped in Verviers, living at home until he was 35, when he left to work in Li\u00e8ge, two years before the Rwandan massacre. He was civil servant in a social security office, where colleagues remember him as quiet and law-abiding. He befriended a Rwandan Hutu, was drawn into the Rwandan expatriate community and was soon seen in the company of Rwandan diplomats and officials of President Juvenal Habyarimana's,party, the MRND. On his first trip to Rwanda he was met by about 50 people at the airport. It must have stroked the ego of one from such a bland background. His visits to Rwanda convinced him of the Hutu view that they were being dominated by the Tutsi minority. By the time Habyarimana died in a plane crash in April 1994 Ruggiu, who had no previous experience as a journalist, was an announcer for Radio Mille Collines, the propaganda mouthpiece of extremist Hutu politicians. When the Hutu regime was overthrown after the three months of slaughter, Ruggiu lay low for a while and then fled to Kenya, where he converted to Islam and took the name Omar. He was sought by the tribunal and Belgium for his alleged role in the killing of 10 Belgian paratroopers whom he accused of involvement in the president's murder. He was living in Mombasa and on the verge of fleeing to Iraq when the Kenyan police arrested him on an international arrest warrant in July 1997. On October 24 last year he pleaded innocent to inciting Hutus to kill Tutsis.

      "body": "<p>To reach the Imperial War Museum's new, permanent Holocaust exhibition you must pass through the atrium. Known as the biggest boys' bedroom in London, it houses the \"dinosaurs of war\" - giant weapons used by both sides during the second world war. This isn't just a physical passage: it's also an ideological one. It points to the obsession with technology which, along with triumphalism and the much mythologised spirit of defiant optimism, for so long characterised the war in British popular imagination. They tell us why it has taken Britain until now to mount any national historical display about the Holocaust.</p> <p>When the Queen opens the exhibition on Tuesday, she will see a very different story. Four years in the making, the Holocaust exhibition travels through this now deeply mined subject without avoiding the contentious issues.</p> <p>The project director, Suzanne Bardgett, believes the exhibition will be a good thing both for the museum and for the Holocaust. She had to anchor the exhibition within the rest of the museum and hopes that it will restore the Holocaust, sometimes thought to lie outside if not beyond history, to its historical context.</p> <p>With this subject, perhaps more than any other, the way you tell it is as critical as what you're telling. Scholar James Young has argued that since the opening of Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin, Holocaust displays must articulate a void without filling it; walls become as emblematic as the showcases they house. And the Imperial War Museum's architectonics are eloquent.</p> <p>The exhibition is laid out on two floors, the upper dealing with the period 1933 to 1939, the lower with the war years, so that you literally descend into the war. The walls are made of terracotta tiles (ironically, German-made) - brown on the upper floor, charcoal black on the lower. The upper floor's walls tilt menacingly towards the visitor, and its floor plan is fractured, with irregularly shaped walkways and recesses. By contrast the lower floor's orthogonal layout is meant to evoke the strictures of occupation. These ideas are there if you look for them and they work on the visitor at a subliminal level, but never obtrude.</p> <p>The first room, an oval wooden amphitheatre, is designed to contrast in shape and texture with the rest of the museum and create a more \"humanistic\" feeling. \"We wanted visitors arriving at the Holocaust exhibition to realise that they're entering a different space from the machines of war. We briefed the designers to ensure that the entrance space is a place where the visitor can become settled,\" says Bardgett.</p> <p>Unlike the Washington Holocaust Memorial Museum, here - in keeping with the general lack of interactive tricksiness - there are no artificial attempts to get the visitor to identify with the victims. One does so automatically through the encounter with the 15 survivors whose testimony, intercut with archival footage on nine monitors, is veined through the exhibition.</p> <p>And in contrast to those Holocaust museums that begin with the destruction, omitting to give any sense of what was destroyed, this first room conveys the richness of pre-war European Jewish life. In photos, video accounts and bursts of song (including the incomparably redolent Bei Mir Bist Du Sch\u00f6n), they evoke the gaiety of Yiddishkeit - poverty laced with exuberance and confidence - as well as the sophisticated modernity of many pre-war Jewish communities. It's impossible not to look at these images with hindsight. All those eager, happy Jewish children - how could they not have known what was to come? I find myself involuntarily scanning the photos for my relatives. This is a room that is hard to leave.</p> <p>Bardgett has tried to focus equally on the state and the officials who perpetrated the Holocaust by skilfully bringing together \"top-down\" history with testimony. She also wanted to explain abstract concepts, such as the obsession with racial purity and the power of propaganda. Film is instrumental in bringing these ideas to life, and the early rooms make good use of German propaganda material.</p> <p>As you make your way around the upper floor, you are pursued by the newsreel sound of Goebbels demanding that artistic and cultural life rid itself of the Jews and become German again. Deutsche this, he thunders, and Deutsche that, he repeats, with such insistent, rhetorical rhythm that you find it hard to concentrate on anything else. Bardgett and her six-strong team deal simply with the much debated arguments about the specificity of the Holocaust and the experience of other persecuted groups such as the Gypsies, people with disabilities and gays. Though there's some material on them here, the main focus is unequivocally on the persecution of European Jews. In 2001 a permanent exhibition on other genocides of our time will open.</p> <p>Still, the racial purity theme enables the curators to look at the origins of the Holocaust in the Nazi euthanasia programme. Artful use is made of artefacts, like the chilling phrenological instruments used by \"race scientists\" to measure the heads of Jews, Gypsies, and mentally and physically handicapped people to \"prove\" how far they fell short of the Aryan ideal.</p> <p>It's extraordinary how poignant a broken comb can be. Three are included in the collection of glasses, keys and buttons belonging to Jews shot by Germans and local collaborators in 1941 at Ponary, near Vilnius, and Kovno. They set off associations with the real and mythological uses to which Jewish hair was put.</p> <p>Carefully displayed are brutal exhibits that might potentially gratify the voyeuristically inclined, like the book press used to crush prison ers' limbs in the Janowski camp on the outskirts of Lvov. But there's an undeniable shock value in seeing actual, now iconic, objects such as a canister of Zyklon B gas pellets, or a cart used to collect the dead in the Warsaw ghetto.</p> <p>These relics are in short supply and competed for keenly (120 institutions and individuals have loaned them). Did Bardgett ever feel disgusted at having to pitch so enthusiastically for such gruesome booty? \"We got used to the situation where the appearance in the project office of an especially 'good' yellow star was a source of jubilation. You find yourself thinking in quite competitive terms over quite grotesque things, like the marble dissecting-table we found in the psychiatric hospital at Kaufbeuren-Irsee. You have to remind yourself what you're dealing with, but the stories attached to each artefact bring you back to it.\"</p> <p>Curatorship's awful ironies are nowhere more apparent than in the exhibition's 800 shoes, on 10-year loan from the Majdanek State Museum from its store of 800,000. Some have their heels torn off as a result of the Nazi search for valuables. On arrival in London last September they were immediately sent to the Museum of London, where a conservator from a six-person team spent over 20 minutes on each one. They cleaned them with swabs soaked in de-ionised water and industrial spirit to remove post-war dirt while attempting to retain wartime mud and polish. The gentle handling accorded to the shoes makes an ineffable contrast with that meted out to their owners.</p> <p>Exhibitions are inevitably artefact-based; but can everything be illustrated and if not, must museums necessarily neglect it? Bardgett acknowledges that there are no pictorial records of some horrors; for them, testimony must suffice. But her staff have also used ingenuity to represent a complex idea like the bureaucracy of murder. The walls of a large square room, reminiscent of a 30s office, are covered with a massive organisation chart showing the extensive, complex web of Nazi government agencies and private firms which administered the genocide.</p> <p>Unlike the Washington Museum, there's no attempt to \"anglicise\" the Holocaust. Although mainland Britain wasn't occupied during the war, Bardgett contends that it was clearly touched by it in a number of ways, among them as a place of refuge for some 50,000 people.</p> <p>The exhibition tells the story from a European perspective, but also shows its impact on this side of the English Channel in a series of four \"News reaches Britain\" showcases punctuating the lower floor. They record admirable British actions, like the Kindertransporte , but also the swathes of indifference to the Jewish plight. Britain-as-plucky- little-vanquisher is significantly absent.</p> <p>The last room, like the first, is an oval wooden amphitheatre and also intended as a reflective space. While the museum isn't a memorial, Bardgett realised that many visitors would want some final space in which to memorialise. Here, one can sit and listen to the survivors' own summing-up, which is usefully varied and conflicting.</p> <p>The museum has eschewed the American liberal idea that the Holocaust can be used to teach tolerance or any redemptive conclusion. On the contrary, the quotation they use from Anne Frank's diary isn't the usual one about her enduring faith in human goodness despite it all, but one maintaining that she can't believe that the world will ever be normal again for her family.</p> <p>As you emerge from the Imperial War Museum into the light, you realise that she was right, and not only for her family.</p> <p>The Holocaust Exhibition is at the Imperial War Museum, London SE1 from Tuesday.

Cons: Only one vegetarian option. Delivery: Same day in London, next day elsewhere, in handy coolbags. Charges: Meal kits for two start at \u00a314.90. Add \u00a34.50 for delivery.",

      "bodyText": "It was a hot summer night 79 years ago. \"My mother saw four men with torches coming towards our house,\" said George Monroe. \"Everything was burning outside and you could hear gunshot. \"She told us kids - I was five - to get under the bed and hide. I could see the boots the men had on as they came in the house and set fire to the curtains and anything else that would burn.\" It was the start of the worst race riot in American history and it ended with an estimated 300 dead - the vast majority of whom were black - more than 1,000 buildings destroyed and the area known in the southern states as Black Wall Street wiped out for ever. Now an 84-year-old war veteran, Mr Monroe is a guest of honour with a dozen other survivors at a service in central Tulsa, a few yards from where the slaughter took place. The survivors are at the centre of the controversial issue of reparation: how the United States makes amends to the victims of racial violence and discrimination. The riot started following a rumour that a 19-year-old black shoe-shiner named Dick Rowland had molested a white elevator operator named Sarah Page in the lift of the Drexel building on Main Street. Rowland was accused of a sexual assault and the white-owned newspaper, the Tulsa Tribune, published an article headlined To Lynch Negro Tonight. A white mob headed for the court where Rowland was due to appear. Black friends had heard what was happening and were there too, some armed, to protect him. Shots were fired -who fired first is unclear - and several men fell. The local police created deputies of many white men, including members of the Ku Klux Klan, and the ensuing battle moved across the tracks and into Greenwood, the black business area of the city, where it raged for 14 hours before being ended by the military. Public funerals for the black dead were banned to avoid any potentially explosive gatherings, and insurance companies refused to compensate the victims. \"We were taught nothing about it as children,\" said Don Ross, a Democrat state congressman. \"It wasn't until I was in high school that I heard about it.\" Reparation Three years ago, he drafted a law which created the race riot commission, which has since met to recommend ways in which the survivors can be compensated and the dead properly remembered. So far 99 survivors have been traced. Reparation is part of a growing movement in the US which, at one end of the scale, seeks a proportion of taxes to be paid to the African-American population in reparation for slavery, racial violence and discrimination. Later this month, the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparation in America meets in conference at Howard University in Washington to discuss its aims of \"just recompense for long years of brutal enslavement righteous dollars for the unpaid labour of our ancestors\". They cite reparations paid by the US to Japanese-Americans who were interned during the second world war, and to native Americans, and by Austria to Holocaust survivors, as precedents for governments making amends for past wrongs. Tulsa was only one of more than 40 race riots between 1874 and the 1940s, but so far only the Oklahoma and the Florida legislatures are seriously discussing reparation. Florida has voted for $2m (\u00a31.3m) in compensation to the survivors of a race riot in Rosewood in 1923. Many US cities are now watching Tulsa to see how far such reparation goes. The moves in Tulsa have provoked some opposition, said Pete Churchwell, the chairman of the race riot commission. \"People say, 'you're going to pay millions of dollars of tax money and my family wasn't even here in 1921',\" he said. \"None of the survivors are clamouring for money, they just want their story to be told. That's why we want to stress that it is about reconciliation rather than compensation. \"In our initial report we said we thought reparations should only be made to the living survivors, and we listed a broad band of other possible things that could be done - scholarships, memorials - rather than just paying people money.\" Opponents of reparation have accused its proponents of opening old wounds. Recognition The survivors are gratified that finally some recognition is being made. \"We were on the front line,\" said Otis Clark, 97, at the evangelical service in his honour. \"My step-daddy got killed. I never saw him again. I wonder if he was incinerated or dumped in the river. Our home was burned down. They were there to get the coloured out of the area. \"They wouldn't let us have funerals,\" he said. \"A lot of our leading folks was missing by the end and then they built a freeway through the property.\" Dick Rowland, who was thought to have only accidentally brushed Page in the lift, survived but was never brought to trial as she refused to press charges.
