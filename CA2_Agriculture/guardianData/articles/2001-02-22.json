Colleagues dismissed suggestions that 62-year-old Lord Mackay was the victim of an excess burden of work as their main home affairs spokesman until recently. As such he faced a deluge of detailed legislation in successive sessions under Labour after being a hard-working junior minister and whip in various departments in the Thatcher-Major years. In the half-reformed House of Lords where Tory peers have been trying to assert their new constitutional \"legitimacy\" the price of fighting the Labour-dominated Commons has been more late sessions. \"John always prepared meticulously for debates,\" recalled one Lords official who knew him well. As such he shadowed Labour's Home Office minister, Lord Bassam, until last autumn when he took on the lighter duties of chairman of Lords committees. The former MP for Argyll and Bute from 1979-87, who had been \"on the woolsack\" - the equivalent of Commons Speaker - when the Lords rose at 3.32am yesterday, was rushed to St George's hospital in Tooting, south London, with a suspected heart attack.

      "body": "<p>Thursday the 15th was one of the longest days of my life - well, my travelling life anyway. Rising with my alarm at the ever popular time of 5am I dragged myself into work for the breakfast shift in the hotel restaurant. There were three of us working that morning, shut in a cupboard to do the kind of dogsbody work that keeps us out of trouble, but also means we can have a lot of fun on our own. </p> <p>We had two hours' break - time for a quick drink across the road - before we started our second shift of the day. That evening I was serving at a wine-tasting conference, and the phrase thrown in at the deep end seems entirely appropriate here. Besides dropping a tray of wine down myself and some of the hotel furniture nothing went too badly wrong, and I even got to finish early. At midnight. </p> <p>Another traveller, Amanda and I went across the road again for a drink. It was here I met another of my occasional freaks. He had just arrived from LA, alone, and was keen to sit and buy us a drink, so we let him. Shortly after that Amanda looked down to see his hand in her bag, to which he commented: \"I hope you don't think I'm trying to steal anything!\" We both quite certainly did. We made excuses to go pretty quickly - he'd also said some other odd things too, and people like that are best when you're a long way away from them. </p> <p>Before we left we warned the bouncers about him so I think he'd have been leaving very shortly after us. Do I meet a disproportionate number of oddballs or have other travellers found the same? </p> <p>So I finally got home at 3am - approaching 24 hours after I left the house. </p> <p>On Friday, I wasn't physically capable of doing anything. To give myself a sugar hit I bought an apple pie (up 'til now I've been comfortably living on hotel meals) and accidentally ate it all. I have a vague memory of dozing on and off and watching some of Toy Story before my evening shift. </p> <p>The do was a charity auction and we were slammed (that's the technical word for being ridiculously busy). There were over 600 happy bidders just dying for me to give them more wine - this job at least makes you popular. One good point was the evening's entertainment, which was Ronnie Corbett. Fortunately we got to watch him. He was hilarious - several British-orientated jokes too, which I haven't heard for a while. </p> <p>That evening, I found out my mum is coming to Sydney on the 28th of this month (see, I have mentioned you!), so soon there will be someone to give me another view on the city, and I'll have an excellent excuse to take some time off work. </p> <p>I don't know why but, after the auction function I couldn't sleep well, and failed to wake with my alarm the next morning and so jolted awake 15 minutes before I was due to start work. Suffice to say I didn't make it on time. Still, it didn't really matter as the rest of my day was spent hosting. I have nothing good to say about it, so I won't. </p> <p>That night me, Brian and two boys from my old hostel headed off to Homebush Bay (Olympic Park) to watch a double rugby game. Up to now I've had no interest in the sport, and I didn't know the rules, so the others spent a lot of the first game explaining what was going on. It's all to do with the six tackle rule. If that means something to you, excellent. If not go watch a match anyway - they're a lot of fun. </p> <p>There were four local teams playing in two matches, and multi-coloured supporters in their thousands. In the first match, Paramatta Eels thrashed Penrith panthers, after which we were treated to an appallingly bad cheerleader show before the next match. The Sydney Roosters were playing in this, and I decided that since they were my local team I would support them - and realised how easy it is to get sucked in to the passion of sport. </p> <p>The crowd were getting steadily drunker and we managed to get a Mexican wave flowing continuously round the stadium. Several fights broke out and I think by the end of the second game (Sydney won) more attention was being paid to these outbreaks than the game itself. Still, I really enjoyed my evening and would definitely recommend going to see a local sport if you're travelling - one of my few regrets from Canada was not watching an ice-hockey match. </p> <p>Sunday morning I had to work after less than five hours sleep. I think the craziest thing was that this amount was more than any other staff member I spoke to had got. That evening Brian and I settled for sharing a chocolate cheesecake and a box of wine - they're just so fantastically cheap, how can you refuse?! I collapsed semi-conscious while trying to watch a video, but at least I had a good rest. </p> <p>Monday I had a WHOLE day off! I indulged in one of my favourite hobbies - eating fresh fruit on the beach. I think maybe I was a bit excessive as I brought a whole pineapple, but there's just something great about it - in fact a group next to me got up and left saying \"I fancy some pineapple.\" Brian and I went to Bondi to have a stab at a pub quiz without all the arguing you get in a big group. Unfortunately we were totally hopeless, but we did get given a jug of beer for no reason. Unfortunately Brian doesn't drink beer so you can imagine where that all went. </p> <p>Whereas I described Thursday as my longest day, I think Tuesday could safely be my illest day. I looked like a walking zombie at work that morning, though miraculously I made it through without falling over or anything messier. Predictably I returned to my apartment that evening and collapsed until the next morning, which is absolutely necessary if I'm going to make it through that one. Wednesday involved a breakfast and lunch function. It was a total nightmare as I kept tripping over the closely squashed together tables, though nothing got thrown on the floor, which is a bonus. </p> <p>The big buzz at the hotel was about a particular celebrity who's staying there, and it's bits of excitement like this that make me enjoy my job and think at least I'm seeing something new every day. And tomorrow is payday, which is perhaps another reason why I enjoy my job . . . </p> <p>Until next week (when I'll see both famous faces and family faces) <br>Milly</p> <p> PS Reading through <a href=\" http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netjetters/milly/feedback/0,8437,398205,00.html\">your emails</a>, I notice there is a bit of a developing war on the theme of \"New Zealand: Time of your life or time to get wet and bored?\" Anyone else got any comments?</p>",

If I did I would be the first to apologise.</p> <p>\"There is no real difference between party political campaigning and fundraising because I believe that fundraising is an inherent part of party political campaigning.\"</p> <p>Every minister from the prime minister downwards was involved in fund raising for the party, he said.</p> <p>Asked by Lord Strathclyde, shadow leader of the Lords, whether he would raise funds again, Lord Irvine replied that unless the rules were changed, he would consider doing it again. But he added that in practice he would first consider the furore which the issue had caused.</p> <p>He insisted he did not believe any lawyer attending the Labour party fundraising dinner which he hosted could have conceivably thought it could have \"bought\" them an advantage in gaining appointment.</p> <p>Lord Irvine's judgment was widely challenged after it emerged at the weekend that he sent a letter to Labour-sympathetic lawyers asking them to donate \u00a3200 at a party fund-raising dinner.</p> <p>Lord Irvine said it was misconceived to claim that the lord chancellor was not a party political post, pointing out that Tory predecessors, including Lord Hailsham, had spoken in election campaigns.</p> <p>The Labour headquarters at Millbank supplemented the claim by highlighting politically controversial interviews given in the 1992 election campaign by the last Conservative lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. Millbank also asserted that previous Tory lord chancellors had attended party fund raising events.</p> <p>However, the former Conser vative deputy prime minister and barrister, Lord Howe, said Lord Irvine had transformed the position by personally conducting fundraising.</p> <p>He said: \"None of Lord Irvine's predecessors acted as hosts of fund raising dinners attended solely by people over whose professional careers they have profound influence.\"</p> <p>Some Labour MPs and Liberal Democrats also asserted that no cabinet minister should ever seek political funds from anyone dependent on the same minister for their professional preferment.</p> <p>Bob Marshall-Andrews, a Labour backbencher and QC, said: \"The one thing no minister must conceivably do is to attempt to solicit funds for political purposes from those over whom he has influence, power or patronage.\"</p> <p>Since 26,000 annual public appointments are made by ministers, such a principle would effectively prevents ministers from any fund-raising activity.</p> <p>During question time in the Lords yesterday, the Liberal Democrat peer, Lord McNally, pressed Lord Irvine \"whether the role of lord chancellor is compatible with that of a party fundraiser?\"</p> <p>He added: \"There's a blurring by your behaviour of your responsibilities as a minister and your responsibilities as a politician.\"</p> <p>Later Lord Strathcyle said: \"The lord chancellor arrogantly failed to offer any kind of apology for action that has been universally condemned. He showed no humility, no sense of personal responsibility or any shred of concern for the storm of criticism\".</p> <p>Lord Irvine did not rule out the Labour policy of a judicial appointments commission, so handing the appointment of judges to an independent body.</p> <p>He said: \"It is a very controversial proposition, and you know well that there are many who are really opposed to that proposition because of the dangers which it is said to pose to appointments on merit only, as distinct from appointments which make compromises.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "An unrepentant lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, yesterday faced new Tory charges of arrogance when he refused to apologise for raising funds for Labour, insisting he had broken no current rules. During a tense 15 minute cross-examination, and standing the traditional two paces away from his seat on the woolsack, Lord Irvine told peers he had not undermined the integrity of his unique office. In his only concession to critics who claim he has compromised the political independence of his post, he said he would comply with any future rules restricting such fund-raising. He also pointed out that, from next month, a commissioner for judicial appointments will scrutinise the integrity of all appointments to the judiciary. Speaking for the first time since he came under attack, Lord Irvine told peers: \"I do not believe I have done anything wrong nor do I believe I have broken any current rules. If I did I would be the first to apologise. \"There is no real difference between party political campaigning and fundraising because I believe that fundraising is an inherent part of party political campaigning.\" Every minister from the prime minister downwards was involved in fund raising for the party, he said. Asked by Lord Strathclyde, shadow leader of the Lords, whether he would raise funds again, Lord Irvine replied that unless the rules were changed, he would consider doing it again. But he added that in practice he would first consider the furore which the issue had caused. He insisted he did not believe any lawyer attending the Labour party fundraising dinner which he hosted could have conceivably thought it could have \"bought\" them an advantage in gaining appointment. Lord Irvine's judgment was widely challenged after it emerged at the weekend that he sent a letter to Labour-sympathetic lawyers asking them to donate \u00a3200 at a party fund-raising dinner. Lord Irvine said it was misconceived to claim that the lord chancellor was not a party political post, pointing out that Tory predecessors, including Lord Hailsham, had spoken in election campaigns. The Labour headquarters at Millbank supplemented the claim by highlighting politically controversial interviews given in the 1992 election campaign by the last Conservative lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. Millbank also asserted that previous Tory lord chancellors had attended party fund raising events. However, the former Conser vative deputy prime minister and barrister, Lord Howe, said Lord Irvine had transformed the position by personally conducting fundraising. He said: \"None of Lord Irvine's predecessors acted as hosts of fund raising dinners attended solely by people over whose professional careers they have profound influence.\" Some Labour MPs and Liberal Democrats also asserted that no cabinet minister should ever seek political funds from anyone dependent on the same minister for their professional preferment. Bob Marshall-Andrews, a Labour backbencher and QC, said: \"The one thing no minister must conceivably do is to attempt to solicit funds for political purposes from those over whom he has influence, power or patronage.\" Since 26,000 annual public appointments are made by ministers, such a principle would effectively prevents ministers from any fund-raising activity. During question time in the Lords yesterday, the Liberal Democrat peer, Lord McNally, pressed Lord Irvine \"whether the role of lord chancellor is compatible with that of a party fundraiser?\" He added: \"There's a blurring by your behaviour of your responsibilities as a minister and your responsibilities as a politician.\" Later Lord Strathcyle said: \"The lord chancellor arrogantly failed to offer any kind of apology for action that has been universally condemned. He showed no humility, no sense of personal responsibility or any shred of concern for the storm of criticism\". Lord Irvine did not rule out the Labour policy of a judicial appointments commission, so handing the appointment of judges to an independent body. He said: \"It is a very controversial proposition, and you know well that there are many who are really opposed to that proposition because of the dangers which it is said to pose to appointments on merit only, as distinct from appointments which make compromises.\"",

The site is called the ministry for silly regulations \u0096 based on Monty Python's ministry for silly walks \u0096 and catalogues the rules and regulations facing UK busineses which it alleges are costing businesses up to \u00a36bn a year. The satirical site features photographs of pinstriped men in bowler hats standing on the beach at Dover eyeing the Continent suspiciously through telescopes. At the site's launch today, Mr Hague dubbed the prime minister \"Red-tape Tony\" and said: \" I am particularly delighted be launching a new web site, sillyregs.com. \"While the name might be lighthearted it carries a deadly serious message.

Who else can project the same mixture of arrogance and tangential understanding of real life that proved so effective in keeping British women on their toes? Eminem? A promising candidate, though there are those who say his misogyny is all an act. Lord Falconer? He should shortly be looking for a new job, and shares Jay's talent for winding up those he calls \"ordinary\". Then again, his own fuller-figure might make it difficult for him to lecture women, as Jay did, on the importance of keeping fit. Sophie Dahl, that living rebuke to body-fascism as tackled in the women's unit summit? Though she is, like Jay, both privileged and tall, most women rather admire her. Lady Victoria Hervey, (pronounced pervy)? Here, I think, we have a contender. Lady Victoria, to judge by her interview with Simon Hattenstone this week, combines invincible self-esteem with a genuine desire to set more feckless women an example and send them out to work. She is, as recent nude photographs demonstrate, wholly at ease with her body image. Her social diary suggests an almost perfect work-life balance. Where Jay had a close relationship with Good Housekeeping, Lady Victoria has the more up-to-date GQ. Finally, like Jay, she is a born aristocrat, requiring only the marginal promotion to go out into the world, and start doing good. Why wait?",

A pilot scheme will be unveiled today in which mothers under 20 will be able to leave their children with registered childminders in a \"rights and responsibilities\" deal designed to haul them out of poverty and into work.</p> <p>The move is prompted in part by the government's determination to curb the number of teenage pregnancies. Britain has the highest rate of teenage births in western Europe - double the number of Germany, three times that of France and six times that of the Netherlands.</p> <p>The \u00a33m pilot scheme, which forms part of the government's commitment to erase child poverty, will initially help 200 teenage mothers who have little support from their families, have left home or are in care.</p> <p>Four areas with low levels of education and training and high instances of teenage pregnancy will be targeted. But ministers expect the scheme to be extended nationwide to cover all teenage mothers, should the three-year pilot prove successful.</p> <p>\"Obviously, where families support the mothers, there isn't the need for the extra money, so we've been focusing on the most isolated cases, but if it works then we'll expand it,\" Margaret Hodge, the education and employment minister, said.</p> <p>The move builds on the recommendations of a report into teenage pregnancy by the social exclusion unit, commissioned by the prime minister, which stressed that \"young parents should have the chance to complete their education\", but acknowledged that they faced \"a range of barriers\" including the availability and cost of childcare. The cost of a childminder averages \u00a390 a week, with a nursery place around \u00a3110.</p> <p>The report, published in June 1999, also found that teenage mothers were less likely than their childless counterparts to finish their education, less likely to find a good job, and more likely to end up both as single parents and to bring their children up in poverty.</p> <p>Young girls in care are particularly likely to be caught in the teenage pregnancy trap, with a quarter pregnant at 16 and nearly half pregnant within two years of leaving care.</p> <p>Last night Ms Hodge stressed that the government was trying to reduce the \"unacceptable\" levels of teenage pregnancy through clearer sex education in schools. She added: \"When teenagers do have children - and where there is no family support, perhaps because the mother has been in care - it is in the interests of both the mother and the child for the mother to stay in education and training.</p> <p>\"At present 90% of teenage mums live on benefits and they are more likely to stay on benefit for longer. We must change that.\"</p> <p>Mothers, who will initially be drawn from Blackpool, north-east Lincolnshire, and Greenwich, Dagenham and Barking in south-east London and Essex, will be able to place their children with registered childminders who will look after no more than three children each.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is considering giving all teenage mothers free full-time childcare if they undergo training or return to school. A pilot scheme will be unveiled today in which mothers under 20 will be able to leave their children with registered childminders in a \"rights and responsibilities\" deal designed to haul them out of poverty and into work. The move is prompted in part by the government's determination to curb the number of teenage pregnancies. Britain has the highest rate of teenage births in western Europe - double the number of Germany, three times that of France and six times that of the Netherlands. The \u00a33m pilot scheme, which forms part of the government's commitment to erase child poverty, will initially help 200 teenage mothers who have little support from their families, have left home or are in care. Four areas with low levels of education and training and high instances of teenage pregnancy will be targeted. But ministers expect the scheme to be extended nationwide to cover all teenage mothers, should the three-year pilot prove successful. \"Obviously, where families support the mothers, there isn't the need for the extra money, so we've been focusing on the most isolated cases, but if it works then we'll expand it,\" Margaret Hodge, the education and employment minister, said. The move builds on the recommendations of a report into teenage pregnancy by the social exclusion unit, commissioned by the prime minister, which stressed that \"young parents should have the chance to complete their education\", but acknowledged that they faced \"a range of barriers\" including the availability and cost of childcare. The cost of a childminder averages \u00a390 a week, with a nursery place around \u00a3110. The report, published in June 1999, also found that teenage mothers were less likely than their childless counterparts to finish their education, less likely to find a good job, and more likely to end up both as single parents and to bring their children up in poverty. Young girls in care are particularly likely to be caught in the teenage pregnancy trap, with a quarter pregnant at 16 and nearly half pregnant within two years of leaving care. Last night Ms Hodge stressed that the government was trying to reduce the \"unacceptable\" levels of teenage pregnancy through clearer sex education in schools. She added: \"When teenagers do have children - and where there is no family support, perhaps because the mother has been in care - it is in the interests of both the mother and the child for the mother to stay in education and training. \"At present 90% of teenage mums live on benefits and they are more likely to stay on benefit for longer. We must change that.\" Mothers, who will initially be drawn from Blackpool, north-east Lincolnshire, and Greenwich, Dagenham and Barking in south-east London and Essex, will be able to place their children with registered childminders who will look after no more than three children each.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>A GOOD DAY IN THE NORTH</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>A GOOD DAY IN THE NORTH</strong></p> <p>Sometimes we're all guilty of getting sucked into the Premiership and SPL soap opera: how Ken Bates's trousers are chafing his thighs, or how Jim McClean's anger-management course is going, that sort of thing. Meanwhile, down the divisions, clubs are struggling to survive. Clubs like Airdrie and Hull City. So now and again it's nice to report some good news: today saw - in a move probably unheard of since those heady days of Queen Elizabeth I - not one, but two stays of execution.</p> <p>Earlier this afternoon, the Scottish Football League agreed to postpone Airdrie's game against Ross County this weekend to allow administrators KPMG to find a solution to the club's financial problems. Obviously the decision is a lot more humane - and sensible - than that of the Scottish FA, who last week threw Airdrie out of the Scottish Cup (where they could have made some money). However, despite the good news, Airdrie aren't safe yet. SFL secretary Peter Donald today admitted that \"this type of offer is not open-ended, and although no cut-off date has been set it clearly cannot go on for ever\".</p> <p>Even so, no reason to grieve just yet. And later on, there was better news for Hull City, who survived a winding-up order after a mystery buyer agreed to plough \u00a385,000 down a drain - sorry, into the club - to keep it trading. Rumours abound as to whether this buyer is an American millionaire - \"Jeez, I just love these bouncing Tiggers\" - or a London consortium which has joined forces with the Tiger Co-operative. But either way it's got to be great news for the club: the players will be paid for the first time since Christmas, and the rent on Boothferry Park will be also be met up to March 8 - when two rival bids will be discussed in a meeting between creditors and shareholders. It's been a good day: let's hope an even better one is just around the corner.</p> <p><strong>SPACE IS THE PLACE</strong></p> <p>Claudio Ranieri, manager of top people's boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea, didn't have a row with any of his players during last Sunday's FA Cup rumble with Arsenal. Not even with chippy shop steward Dennis Wise - and the club are prepared to sue anyone brave enough to put it in an exclusive on their back page (ie: The Sun). \"There was no confrontation at half-time,\" explained Chelsea Village commissionaire Colin Hutchinson. \"As I understand it, Ranieri did not say a lot. He sat down and was reflective. He then said some inspiring words before going out for the second half.\"</p> <p>But while we accepted the burly doorman's account - and reflected on how a chap must feel when \"inspired\" by one of Ranieri's successful orations (what was the score at half-time again?) - we were at a loss to explain today's developments. It seems the entire Chelsea's of Chelsea playing staff has left the fashionable Kings Rahd in favour of Tenerife - leaving poor Claudio behind. Luckily, before anyone could say \"I think we both need to give each other some space\", Hutchinson was on hand to ease our troubled mind, the epaulettes on his blazer lightly flapping in the light West London breeze.</p> <p>\"It was never intended that Claudio would go with the players to Tenerife,\" Hutch told London's Evening Standard newspaper, before explaining how Ranieri has flown home on a pre-arranged visit to Italy to visit his family, watch some games and \"hopefully do a bit on his English as well\". Big Colin continued: \"It was decided to let the players have a break from Ranieri and for him to have a break from them. There is nothing sinister in it.\" That's as maybe, but the Fiver knows from bitter experience that trial separations rarely work out. And with the commissionaire reiterating his support for the boss - \"it's too early to judge Ranieri\" - some Chelsea players shouldn't be surprised if they come back to find their stuff on the doorstep and the locks changed.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I feel useless\" - Like Woody in Toy Story, the once-loved but now overlooked Valencia midfielder Didier Deschamps sits slumped on a bench feeling sorry for himself.</p> <p><strong>LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE</strong></p> <p>It gets dull when the same few teams win all the time. And like you, the Fiver is sick of seeing the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester pick up all the gongs season after season. So thank God for this year's Worthington Cup final, which pits two unfashionable and perennially hopeless outfits against each other for the big prize. Neither Birmingham nor Liverpool have won anything for decades, so whatever the outcome in the Millennium Stadium on Sunday, it's bound to be a breath of fresh air.</p> <p>And the crazy Cup fever began in earnest today, with Birmingham's Michael Johnson outlining his plans to outfox opponents Liverpool with some crafty psychological warfare. It seems the Blues \"psyched out\" Ipswich in the semi-final by shouting at them in the tunnel before the game, and as they won that one 4-1 after extra-time, a repeat could be on the cards. \"We were chanting in the tunnel before the second leg of the match with Ipswich. Most of it couldn't really be repeated in public!\" chortled the fun-loving defender.</p> <p>So while Johnson will be rocking with mirth all the way down to Cardiff, the Liverpool players must make their journey with trepidation, fearing they may be subjected to the sort of dirt and filth Ipswich had to suffer - lines like \"Ipswich don't fancy it tonight\", \"we really want this\" and \"they won't be able to play on this pitch\". Sends a chill down the spine, doesn't it? Of course, the Anfield club were accused of famously bottling it in the tunnel before the 1988 FA Cup final against Wimbledon, but that was with totally-comfortable-with-his-sexuality actor Vinnie Jones screaming in their faces. This won't be the same at all. Will it?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Fatih Terim will take over from Alberto Zaccheroni as manager of AC Milan, while former Argentina and Uruguay boss Daniel Passarella will become boss of Internazionale, according to Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi. \"Terim has been lined up as Milan boss for a long time, and also Passarella is on his way to Inter,\" Moggi told journalists from Italian paper Corriere della Serra.</p> <p>Leeds \"have been linked with an unlikely move\" for AC Milan striker Oliver Bierhoff, claims Planet Football. They don't provide any evidence to back up their claim, though.</p> <p>Manchester United are ready to make a \u00a315m summer swoop for Parma's French international right-back Lilian Thuram, according to the Sun.</p> <p>Juanjo looks set to quit Hearts after snubbing a new contract offer.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>The Football League have charged Chesterfield with a number of breaches of its regulations. The charges relate to breaches of player transfer regulations, irregular payments, and the under-reporting of gate receipts. In addition, individual charges are also being made against a number of officials and employees at the club. Chesterfield, currently 14 points clear at the top of the table, have 14 days in which to respond to the charges.</p> <p>The Premier League have announced a deal for overseas television rights worth \u00a3178m over the next three years. The agreement with a consortium including Canal Plus, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, TWI and Octagon represents a rise of around \u00a380m on the previous overseas rights deal.</p> <p>Uefa have confirmed that Leeds and Galatasaray would not be deliberately kept apart if both sides made it into the Big Cup quarter-final draw. \"We know what happened last year was terrible, but if they were drawn together, the match would take place,\" a Uefa spokesman admitted.</p> <p>Christoph Daum, dumped as the next Germany coach after failing a doping test, has admitted he is on a drugs rehabilitation course. \"I go there twice a week for four hours. We talk about how it happened to me and, most importantly, about what I have to do to make sure it never happens again,\" he told Bild newspaper.</p> <p>Ipswich have completed the signing of Celtic striker Mark Burchill on loan until the end of the season. Burchill goes straight into the squad for Saturday's match with Everton, as Town will be without strikers Marcus Stewart and Richard Naylor.</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>Talksport: Football First - Club 19.31 with John Kearns (7pm) </p> <p>\"Sob!

      "bodyText": "A GOOD DAY IN THE NORTH Sometimes we're all guilty of getting sucked into the Premiership and SPL soap opera: how Ken Bates's trousers are chafing his thighs, or how Jim McClean's anger-management course is going, that sort of thing. Meanwhile, down the divisions, clubs are struggling to survive. Clubs like Airdrie and Hull City. So now and again it's nice to report some good news: today saw - in a move probably unheard of since those heady days of Queen Elizabeth I - not one, but two stays of execution. Earlier this afternoon, the Scottish Football League agreed to postpone Airdrie's game against Ross County this weekend to allow administrators KPMG to find a solution to the club's financial problems. Obviously the decision is a lot more humane - and sensible - than that of the Scottish FA, who last week threw Airdrie out of the Scottish Cup (where they could have made some money). However, despite the good news, Airdrie aren't safe yet. SFL secretary Peter Donald today admitted that \"this type of offer is not open-ended, and although no cut-off date has been set it clearly cannot go on for ever\". Even so, no reason to grieve just yet. And later on, there was better news for Hull City, who survived a winding-up order after a mystery buyer agreed to plough \u00a385,000 down a drain - sorry, into the club - to keep it trading. Rumours abound as to whether this buyer is an American millionaire - \"Jeez, I just love these bouncing Tiggers\" - or a London consortium which has joined forces with the Tiger Co-operative. But either way it's got to be great news for the club: the players will be paid for the first time since Christmas, and the rent on Boothferry Park will be also be met up to March 8 - when two rival bids will be discussed in a meeting between creditors and shareholders. It's been a good day: let's hope an even better one is just around the corner. SPACE IS THE PLACE Claudio Ranieri, manager of top people's boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea, didn't have a row with any of his players during last Sunday's FA Cup rumble with Arsenal. Not even with chippy shop steward Dennis Wise - and the club are prepared to sue anyone brave enough to put it in an exclusive on their back page (ie: The Sun). \"There was no confrontation at half-time,\" explained Chelsea Village commissionaire Colin Hutchinson. \"As I understand it, Ranieri did not say a lot. He sat down and was reflective. He then said some inspiring words before going out for the second half.\" But while we accepted the burly doorman's account - and reflected on how a chap must feel when \"inspired\" by one of Ranieri's successful orations (what was the score at half-time again?) - we were at a loss to explain today's developments. It seems the entire Chelsea's of Chelsea playing staff has left the fashionable Kings Rahd in favour of Tenerife - leaving poor Claudio behind. Luckily, before anyone could say \"I think we both need to give each other some space\", Hutchinson was on hand to ease our troubled mind, the epaulettes on his blazer lightly flapping in the light West London breeze. \"It was never intended that Claudio would go with the players to Tenerife,\" Hutch told London's Evening Standard newspaper, before explaining how Ranieri has flown home on a pre-arranged visit to Italy to visit his family, watch some games and \"hopefully do a bit on his English as well\". Big Colin continued: \"It was decided to let the players have a break from Ranieri and for him to have a break from them. There is nothing sinister in it.\" That's as maybe, but the Fiver knows from bitter experience that trial separations rarely work out. And with the commissionaire reiterating his support for the boss - \"it's too early to judge Ranieri\" - some Chelsea players shouldn't be surprised if they come back to find their stuff on the doorstep and the locks changed. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I feel useless\" - Like Woody in Toy Story, the once-loved but now overlooked Valencia midfielder Didier Deschamps sits slumped on a bench feeling sorry for himself. LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE It gets dull when the same few teams win all the time. And like you, the Fiver is sick of seeing the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester pick up all the gongs season after season. So thank God for this year's Worthington Cup final, which pits two unfashionable and perennially hopeless outfits against each other for the big prize. Neither Birmingham nor Liverpool have won anything for decades, so whatever the outcome in the Millennium Stadium on Sunday, it's bound to be a breath of fresh air. And the crazy Cup fever began in earnest today, with Birmingham's Michael Johnson outlining his plans to outfox opponents Liverpool with some crafty psychological warfare. It seems the Blues \"psyched out\" Ipswich in the semi-final by shouting at them in the tunnel before the game, and as they won that one 4-1 after extra-time, a repeat could be on the cards. \"We were chanting in the tunnel before the second leg of the match with Ipswich. Most of it couldn't really be repeated in public!\" chortled the fun-loving defender. So while Johnson will be rocking with mirth all the way down to Cardiff, the Liverpool players must make their journey with trepidation, fearing they may be subjected to the sort of dirt and filth Ipswich had to suffer - lines like \"Ipswich don't fancy it tonight\", \"we really want this\" and \"they won't be able to play on this pitch\". Sends a chill down the spine, doesn't it? Of course, the Anfield club were accused of famously bottling it in the tunnel before the 1988 FA Cup final against Wimbledon, but that was with totally-comfortable-with-his-sexuality actor Vinnie Jones screaming in their faces. This won't be the same at all. Will it? THE RUMOUR MILL Fatih Terim will take over from Alberto Zaccheroni as manager of AC Milan, while former Argentina and Uruguay boss Daniel Passarella will become boss of Internazionale, according to Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi. \"Terim has been lined up as Milan boss for a long time, and also Passarella is on his way to Inter,\" Moggi told journalists from Italian paper Corriere della Serra. Leeds \"have been linked with an unlikely move\" for AC Milan striker Oliver Bierhoff, claims Planet Football. They don't provide any evidence to back up their claim, though. Manchester United are ready to make a \u00a315m summer swoop for Parma's French international right-back Lilian Thuram, according to the Sun. Juanjo looks set to quit Hearts after snubbing a new contract offer. NEWS IN BRIEF The Football League have charged Chesterfield with a number of breaches of its regulations. The charges relate to breaches of player transfer regulations, irregular payments, and the under-reporting of gate receipts. In addition, individual charges are also being made against a number of officials and employees at the club. Chesterfield, currently 14 points clear at the top of the table, have 14 days in which to respond to the charges. The Premier League have announced a deal for overseas television rights worth \u00a3178m over the next three years. The agreement with a consortium including Canal Plus, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, TWI and Octagon represents a rise of around \u00a380m on the previous overseas rights deal. Uefa have confirmed that Leeds and Galatasaray would not be deliberately kept apart if both sides made it into the Big Cup quarter-final draw. \"We know what happened last year was terrible, but if they were drawn together, the match would take place,\" a Uefa spokesman admitted. Christoph Daum, dumped as the next Germany coach after failing a doping test, has admitted he is on a drugs rehabilitation course. \"I go there twice a week for four hours. We talk about how it happened to me and, most importantly, about what I have to do to make sure it never happens again,\" he told Bild newspaper. Ipswich have completed the signing of Celtic striker Mark Burchill on loan until the end of the season. Burchill goes straight into the squad for Saturday's match with Everton, as Town will be without strikers Marcus Stewart and Richard Naylor.

      "body": "<p>The number of abused, neglected or at-risk children being looked after by councils in England is on the increase, according to government statistics released today.</p> <p>The number of children looked after because of potential or actual abuse or neglect rose by 11% of the looked-after total in four years to March 2000. Nearly one-third (31%) of looked-after children in 1999-2000 had been at risk or had actually been abused or neglected, compared with one-fifth in 1995-96. </p> <p>But Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it was not yet possible to determine whether the figures represented a rise in child abuse and neglect or a greater vigilance on the part of social workers. </p> <p>ADSS president Moira Gibb said: \"There's a general trend upwards and towards the younger children - and we don't have enough data on why,\" she said. \"There must be a connection with the number of children in poverty and the fact that there has been an emphasis on neglect and the fact that [neglected] children aren't allowed to drift.\"</p> <p>The number of children being looked after by local authorities in England on 31 March 2000 was also up by 5% on the previous year and was 18% higher than the same date in 1994. The total number of children looked after at any time during the year was 92,400 (or 82 for every 10,000 children aged under 18 in England).</p> <p>The figures did, however, express the \"churn\" in children being looked after. \"Because children come into care doesn't mean to say they stay in care,\" said Ms Gibb. \"There's a huge turnover. Lots of people go in and go out and the snapshot and the total can be two different groups. But it will explain part of the pressure on children's budgets.\"</p> <p>Social services departments are gradually approaching the government's target of no more than 16% of children in care having three or more placements in a year. Nearly a fifth (18%) of children in care had had three or more placements during the year to March 2000. But that was down from 19.6% in 1997-98.</p> <p>There has been an upward shift in the age of care leavers. During 1999-2000, 2,700 young people left care aged 16, (down from 3,300 a year earlier); 2,700 left care on their 18th birthday (compared with 2,300 in 1998-99.)

      "bodyText": "The number of abused, neglected or at-risk children being looked after by councils in England is on the increase, according to government statistics released today. The number of children looked after because of potential or actual abuse or neglect rose by 11% of the looked-after total in four years to March 2000. Nearly one-third (31%) of looked-after children in 1999-2000 had been at risk or had actually been abused or neglected, compared with one-fifth in 1995-96. But Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it was not yet possible to determine whether the figures represented a rise in child abuse and neglect or a greater vigilance on the part of social workers. ADSS president Moira Gibb said: \"There's a general trend upwards and towards the younger children - and we don't have enough data on why,\" she said. \"There must be a connection with the number of children in poverty and the fact that there has been an emphasis on neglect and the fact that [neglected] children aren't allowed to drift.\" The number of children being looked after by local authorities in England on 31 March 2000 was also up by 5% on the previous year and was 18% higher than the same date in 1994. The total number of children looked after at any time during the year was 92,400 (or 82 for every 10,000 children aged under 18 in England). The figures did, however, express the \"churn\" in children being looked after. \"Because children come into care doesn't mean to say they stay in care,\" said Ms Gibb. \"There's a huge turnover. Lots of people go in and go out and the snapshot and the total can be two different groups. But it will explain part of the pressure on children's budgets.\" Social services departments are gradually approaching the government's target of no more than 16% of children in care having three or more placements in a year. Nearly a fifth (18%) of children in care had had three or more placements during the year to March 2000. But that was down from 19.6% in 1997-98. There has been an upward shift in the age of care leavers. During 1999-2000, 2,700 young people left care aged 16, (down from 3,300 a year earlier); 2,700 left care on their 18th birthday (compared with 2,300 in 1998-99.) The figures appear to reflect increased incidence of good practice requiring councils not to discharge young people too quickly but to continue to act as \"good parents\". The figures, which are for the year ending 31 March 2000, also confirm a trend towards greater use of the courts. They show that the proportion starting to be looked after under single voluntary agreements has fallen - down from 77% in 1995-96 to 68% in 1999-2000. The number of children who started under interim care orders was 13%, up from 7% in 1995-96. \"This suggests that the complexities of the [child protection] task and of children's lives and tasks are greater,\" said Ms Gibb. \"But we don't know enough to say quite why those trends are occurring.\" The statistics also show the number of looked-after children being adopted has also gone up by 500 to 2,700. This represents more than half of all adoptions in England. Foster parents were looking after 65% of looked-after children, similar to proportions in previous years. Other statistics released today show that children in need form about 2% of the total population aged up to 18. Approximately a quarter of children in need are looked after. These figures highlight a wide and currently unexplained variation in the incidence of children considered in need. Shire counties have \"noticeably lower\" and London authorities \"markedly higher\" incidences than the national average, according to the Department of Health (DoH). \"These variations cannot be wholly explained in terms of social factors alone,\" according to the DoH. Social services in England spend money on about 230,000 children in need in a typical week. Under the Children Act 1989, a child is looked after if he or she is placed in their care by a court (under a care order) or provided with accommodation by the authority's social services department for more than 24 hours. Children are in need if they will have their health or development impaired if they don't get a service. The looked-after statistics released today are based on data provided by 149 authorities. The children in need statistics are based on data from 139 councils.",

      "bodyText": "SMG has raised the stakes in the battle for control of Scottish Radio Holdings after another raid on the company's much-coveted stock. SMG, owner of the Scottish Television and Grampian ITV franchises, has paid \u00a311.9m for 2.3% of SRH's shares, taking its holding in the company to 23%. \"We were offered a line of stock at a sensible price and we felt it was in SMG's long-term interests to take it,\" said a spokesman for SMG. The Glasgow-based group is nearing the shareholder threshold of 29.9%, when stock-market rules dictate it must table an offer for the whole company. However, SMG faces competition from Scottish rival DC Thomson, the privately owned publisher of the Beano and Dandy comics. DC Thomson owns 9.6% of SRH and has closer ties with the radio broadcaster, which owns Radio Clyde in Glasgow, Edinburgh's Radio Forth and the Ireland on Sunday newspaper. The other obstacle in SMG's path is the 1996 Broadcasting Act. This bars the holder of a regional ITV franchise from holding a commercial radio licence in the whole area. But sources close to the tussle for control of SRH claim the guidelines - which were barely mentioned in last year's communications white paper - are sufficiently lax to sneak through some kind of deal. \"The rules are not specific and do not detail the percentage of stock you can hold in different companies,\" said one source. A spokeswoman for SRH said the company is still undergoing a strategic review to determine the company's future, and it is negotiating with \"a number of interested parties\". Shares in SRH became hot property following the publication of the white paper, which hinted at scrapping current restrictions on ownership of commercial radio stations. Big players in such as Emap, GWR and Capital Radio cannot expand much further under the current guidelines. They are keen to consolidate the industry from around a dozen companies to just three.

      "bodyText": "The carefully orchestrated public relations drive surrounding Michael Jackson's trip to the UK has turned into a PR nightmare. PR company MacLaurin has just agreed a deal to handle the eccentric star's March 6 Oxford Union address. But sources say the singer, who is known to be a control freak, has decided to ban radio and TV journalists from the event. It means ITN, Sky News and the BBC, who will all want to cover the unusual event on their news bulletins, will be unable to get pictures. TV cameras camping outside will be unable to get a glimpse of Jackson because of the huge security entourage that will surround him. Jackson, who has undergone dramatic cosmetic surgery and occasionally wears a surgical mask, is hyper-sensitive about his public image. Today it emerged there will also be severe restrictions on the number of journalists who will have access to the Oxford university event. More than 200 reporters have already requested accreditation but access will be limited to 50 places. And it is not even clear if these will get access to the inner chamber where the debate will take place. MacLaurin's deal comes only two weeks after Mark Borkowski PR resigned the same job. It is understood MacLaurin also had difficulties with Jackson's team and newspaper reporters say company chief Brian MacLaurin was on the verge of resigning the account this morning. It is understood the outspoken Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, president of Jackson's Heal the Kids charity and a close adviser to the star, forms part of the LA team responsible for organising the trip. More than 20,000 people applied for tickets to hear Jackson make his first ever public address at the Oxford Union. The singer will use the appearance to launch his Heal the Kids charity in this country. The police are expected to cordon off the streets surrounding the 178-year-old union's debating chamber. During Jackson's week-long visit, he will be the best man at the wedding in Henley of psychic Uri Geller. He will also attend the launch of Geller's and Rabbi Boteach's book, the Confessions of a Rabbi and a Psychic, published by Robson Books under the Chrysalis Books umbrella. The singer also appear at a fan club event called the Michael Jackson Day.",

As such, it has, not surprisingly, become something of a craze with younger drinkers, who have a vast amount of falling over, snogging and throwing up to do before their curfew time. With its kiddie-pleasing flavour, After Shock is fast becoming the Sunny Delight of the spirits world. </p> <p>It is believed that Angela Watts, 16, was drinking After Shock last Saturday night. She went out with her boyfriend and some friends, drinking cocktails at a restaurant, and then continuing drinking at a house party. Her boyfriend's mother woke at 3am to hear Angela being sick. The mother put her back to bed in a spare room, but the next morning, Angela would not wake up. She died in hospital, of presumed alcohol poisoning. </p> <p>The story of her untimely death is the second story of a lethal dose of alcohol in the past week. George Butterworth died, aged 36, after a late-night drinking game at Slaithwaite working men's club. During the game, he downed eight pints and eight double Pernods in 20 minutes. Afterwards the club president, David Thornton, said: \"Mr Butterworth seemed to know what he was doing. He looked like he was having a good time.\" </p> <p>People who drink a vast quantity, over a short period of time, usually know what they are doing. They are getting drunk as quickly as they can. What they are probably not aware of, however, is that a lethal dose can be suprisingly low. Experts say stories about famous boozers downing umpteen bottles of spirits on a night out - and surviving - don't reflect the real dangers. We know long-term alcohol abuse leads to liver damage and all sorts of health nastiness. But do you know how many pints will kill you? Or how many glasses of wine? </p> <p>Alcohol affects different people in different ways. A 20 stone man of 6ft 3in is less likely to collapse under the weight of six vodka and Red Bulls than a seven stone woman of 5ft 5in. Similarly, how you react to alcohol depends greatly upon whether you have eaten recently, whether the alcohol is consumed with that meal, whether you are used to drinking substantial amounts, and also how fit you are. If the strongest thing you have touched all day was that grande skinny latte this morning, and then you wallop down six pints of Stella, don't be surprised to find yourself vomiting in the high street by closing time. </p> <p>So taking all the whys and wherefores into account, what is a lethal dose? Dr Guy Ratcliffe, executive director of the Medical Council on Alcoholism, says that after a dose of about 500mgs of alcohol, \"you are at risk of not surviving\". (To put that into perspective, if your blood alcohol level is at 80mgs and you attempt to drive, you lose your licence. A bottle of spirits, or about 15 pints, contains approximately 500mgs.) </p> <p>\"If you consume 600mgs, death is pretty well nigh certain,\" Ratcliffe adds. \"The effects of alcohol are largely on the nervous system: you will experience a loss of self-control, you will start to stagger, your speech will be slurred, you may experience some difficulty remembering things. You will become oblivious to your surroundings, you may feel sleepy and eventually you may fall into a comatose state.\" Apparently, this is due to \"depression of the higher centres of the brain, which controls respiratory function and triggers the heart to beat\". </p> <p>After a bottle and a half of gin, you are almost certain to be in a comatose position, and in need of intensive care and respiratory support while your body metabolises the alcohol. </p> <p>Strangely, anyone who does survive such a \"major alcohol insult\" is unlikely to experience any long-term effects. It is while under the influence that they are most at risk. And one of the big risks, of course, is that feeling very drunk makes you feel sick; but anyone in a semi-comatose state is also in danger of choking on his or her own vomit. </p> <p>But being sick aside, what exactly is it about a huge dose of alcohol that can kill you? It's quite simple. As Dr Martin Plant, director of the alcohol and health research centre in Edinburgh, puts it: \"In large quantities, alcohol is simply a poison.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Pat Davis presides over one of Bristol's largest retail businesses. A sharply turned out executive with an alphabet soup of letters after her name, she has 27 shops under her management in the city, and oversees the financial arrangements for 220 paid staff and more than 700 volunteers, juggling investments and an annual turnover worth millions. </p> <p>She works from an office in central Bristol, but we meet in her business's premises in the north of the city, an impressive modern building with beautiful, landscaped gardens, dotted with rose bowers, benches and water features. It is a lovely place to work. It is an even more enviable environment in which to die. </p> <p>Those lucky enough not to have required the services of a hospice are likely to be surprised by St Peter's hospice, for which Davis works as fundraising director. Nowhere to be seen are the cracked pipes and grubby paintwork of too many NHS wards. The decor is light and breezy; cheerful nurses sweep along corridors decked in fresh flowers. It feels calm, quiet, restful. </p> <p>But this is not the hushed, stifling quiet of imminent death. The corridors are silent because almost half of the beds are empty. Demand for a place is unrelenting, says Davis, but the hospice can't afford to staff them. Despite the 27 charity shops dedicated to raising funds for the hospice, she can't find the cash to care for any more than 10 in-patients at a time. </p> <p>Most of us, doubtless, prefer not to think of it, but St Peter's is just the place where we would like to imagine ourselves dying: local, pleasant, lavishly staffed by NHS standards, and with a level of specialisation in pain management that is often missing in state-provided health care. The beauty of the place, says Chris Salt, 73, one of the patients, is in the detail: \"Every tray comes with a vase of flowers, it makes such a difference.\" </p> <p>Reflexology and aromatherapy are as much part of the care as that of the specialist palliative nurses who work there. Rooms are often ensuite, and the baths are fitted with jacuzzis. \"If you weren't sick,\" says Salt, \"you would think you were in a five-star hotel.\" </p> <p>They have even taken care in the decor, says Hazel Elliott, the nursing director, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"I told them we weren't to have any of the bedrooms painted green or yellow. If you are a bit jaundiced, the last thing you want is your skin being reflected in the walls.\" </p> <p>We may hope to end our days somewhere so humane, but the question is whether, after we have used up the remainder of our allotted four-score-and-whatever, there will be any hospices left. Of the 230 hospices dotted around the UK, a few are NHS run, others are managed by specialist charities such as Marie Curie Cancer Care, but the vast majority (185) are independent, voluntary set-ups like St Peter's. They are local charities, locally managed - and almost entirely locally funded. And that, says Davis, is the problem. </p> <p>The sector's umbrella group, Help the Hospices, has just issued a bleak warning that more than half the hospices in the UK are in financial trouble. Beds are closing, nurses are being laid off, others are dipping into investments and reserves that are just about keeping the bailiffs at bay, but will not last for ever. </p> <p>The St Peter's site in north Bristol was built three years ago to expand the services offered at another site; in total, it has 20 beds open in the city. But, says, Davis, the organisation's funding from the NHS has gone up \"hardly at all\", despite the fact that service provision has doubled. </p> <p>As well as the in-patients, up to 120 patients attend St Peter's' two sites weekly through day sessions, where they can have their hair done, consult a doctor, or chat with other patients. The hospice also employs nurses who work in the community, helping patients in their homes and providing specialist training to GPs and district nurses. Within the space of a year, 1,200 patients come into direct contact with its services. </p> <p>\"Everybody is working flat out to keep the service at the level we currently have,\" says Davis. \"If we had more money there are other things we would like to do, but we are running to stand still. This year we start with a \u00a3200,000 shortfall. You obviously can't do that for long before you go bankrupt.\" </p> <p>Hospice care has never formed part of core NHS provision. While homes for the dying were run by religious groups from the 19th century, the modern hospice movement can trace its origins to the late 1960s, when a small number of hospices were established. A decision was taken at that point to run them as voluntary charities, in order, says David Praill, chief executive of Help the Hospices, to ensure that the service remained of a higher quality than the statutory minimum inevitably provided by the state. </p> <p>But they were also to remain free and open to anyone. Which meant an enormous commitment to fundraising. And an unrelenting round of tombolas, teddy bear raffles, and local paper photographs of smiling nurses clutching outsized cheques. </p> <p>As other groups established their own hospices, funds from the NHS remained unforthcoming. But as the population has aged and palliative medicine - offered to those for whom a cure is no longer a possibility, but who need help managing pain - has become more sophisticated, governments have recognised that they have a moral responsibility to care for the dying. Many hospices got their first grant from their health authority in the early 90s; this now averages just 30% of running costs nationally. At St Peter's, the figure is 20%. And falling. </p> <p>\"We have to match pay awards in the NHS,\" says Elliott, \"or we would never be able to recruit any nurses.\" Avon health authority, however, has told St Peter's it will get only an inflationary rise for next year. They hope not to close more beds. But they can't go on for ever. </p> <p>The obvious solution is to remove the en suites, cut out the cut flowers, trim the nursing ratio (often at more than one nurse for two patients) and slash other non-essential services. It's a prospect Praill considers with despair. \"There is an intimacy around issues of dying that does not sit easily with the environment of a busy NHS ward,\" he says, \"and we can't begin to resemble that. There is something about end of life care that is different from having a broken leg or getting your tonsils out.\" </p> <p>In September, the government announced an extra \u00a350m for palliative care - very welcome, all say, but it remains to be seen whether any of this money will filter down to funding those services under threat. </p> <p>Salt is packed up and ready to go home today, \"feeling much better\" after her short stay at St Peter's. In fact, more than half of its in-patients are able to return home after a period of crisis care, or a readjustment of the way they manage their pain. </p> <p>\"This is not a place where people come to die,\" says Elliott. \"These are patients for whom death is inevitable at some stage in the predictable future, whether it's in the next few months or the next couple of years. We tend not to talk about the terminally ill - they are living with their illness, and we try to deal with it in that way.\" </p> <p>As we wander the sparkling corridors, I'm shown the family room, where partners can come and spend time with their loved one in the last stages (\"We try to keep it like a honeymoon suite\"). </p> <p>One of the staff takes me aside and tells me the reason she is proud to work at St Peter's. It is the memory, she says, of turning up at hospital just after her father had died, to collect her mother. She found her shooed out into the corridor, a cup of tea in one hand and a bag containing her father's possessions in the other. \"He had the best possible care,\" she says. \"But that is no way to die.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Friday: </strong>The 10th anniversary of One Lung Day is on Thursday, and tonight after dinner the psychosomatic effect kicks in. While playing solo darts and contemplating a 127 check out (treble 19, treble 18, double eight), I suffer sharp pain in the back beneath the left shoulder blade, where the nerve ends for the lungs are located. It was 10 years ago that a young burglar broke into the Johannesburg house I was staying in, breaking my friend's skull and back, and then giving me hammer scars on head and arms preparatory to popping a knife into my left lung. Ten years. How much I have changed. </p> <p><strong>Saturday: </strong>As my friends know, I never talk about the incident ... and yet the approaching anniversary has an impact. Over the dinner my wife has so lovingly prepared (the insouciant way she scoops the bindi bhaji out of the foil carton, the assurance with which she presses the microwave buttons), I remind her how, once the pneumothorax operation had worked and the lung was reinflated, my surgeon Dr Wolfie Frankel pointed at the proximity of the wound to both heart and aorta on the x-ray, and said: \"You, sir, are a very, very lucky boy.\" \"Well, yes, it's always been an ambition,\" I replied. \"I even wrote to Jimmy Savile once, but he never wrote back.\" Perhaps baffled by the reference, he didn't smile, just handed me the x-rays and the bill. </p> <p><strong>Sunday: </strong>The 10th anniversary of One Lung Day is on Thursday, and tonight after dinner the psychosomatic effect kicks in. \"Oh God, no, please no, not the x-rays.\" Rebecca walks into the sitting room and finds me fetching the brown envelope from the top drawer of my office chest. \"Not the 18th of an inch. Not the 0.8 of a millimetre short of the aorta.\" When this metaphorical stab in the back is matched by a literal one (the lung nerve ends are more sensitised by the hour), I return the x-rays and head morosely up to bed. </p> <p><strong>Monday: </strong>A trip to St Mary's, Paddington, reminds me of the day itself - one that dawned for me on a trolley in the reception area of a dismal, underfunded Jo'Burg general hospital and dusked in a private room on the other side of town in a charming private room. The gulf between public and private health is just as wide here now, of course, and in an NHS ward with the traditional peeling walls air of gloom, I visit someone in their 90s being cared for by overstretched nurses making increasingly fraught phone inquiries after a hungry patient's meals. </p> <p>Then it's over the road to the private wing, where I go to see a day-old baby girl and her mother. Here I am offered champagne.

      "bodyText": "Friday: The 10th anniversary of One Lung Day is on Thursday, and tonight after dinner the psychosomatic effect kicks in. While playing solo darts and contemplating a 127 check out (treble 19, treble 18, double eight), I suffer sharp pain in the back beneath the left shoulder blade, where the nerve ends for the lungs are located. It was 10 years ago that a young burglar broke into the Johannesburg house I was staying in, breaking my friend's skull and back, and then giving me hammer scars on head and arms preparatory to popping a knife into my left lung. Ten years. How much I have changed. Saturday: As my friends know, I never talk about the incident ... and yet the approaching anniversary has an impact. Over the dinner my wife has so lovingly prepared (the insouciant way she scoops the bindi bhaji out of the foil carton, the assurance with which she presses the microwave buttons), I remind her how, once the pneumothorax operation had worked and the lung was reinflated, my surgeon Dr Wolfie Frankel pointed at the proximity of the wound to both heart and aorta on the x-ray, and said: \"You, sir, are a very, very lucky boy.\" \"Well, yes, it's always been an ambition,\" I replied. \"I even wrote to Jimmy Savile once, but he never wrote back.\" Perhaps baffled by the reference, he didn't smile, just handed me the x-rays and the bill. Sunday: The 10th anniversary of One Lung Day is on Thursday, and tonight after dinner the psychosomatic effect kicks in. \"Oh God, no, please no, not the x-rays.\" Rebecca walks into the sitting room and finds me fetching the brown envelope from the top drawer of my office chest. \"Not the 18th of an inch. Not the 0.8 of a millimetre short of the aorta.\" When this metaphorical stab in the back is matched by a literal one (the lung nerve ends are more sensitised by the hour), I return the x-rays and head morosely up to bed. Monday: A trip to St Mary's, Paddington, reminds me of the day itself - one that dawned for me on a trolley in the reception area of a dismal, underfunded Jo'Burg general hospital and dusked in a private room on the other side of town in a charming private room. The gulf between public and private health is just as wide here now, of course, and in an NHS ward with the traditional peeling walls air of gloom, I visit someone in their 90s being cared for by overstretched nurses making increasingly fraught phone inquiries after a hungry patient's meals. Then it's over the road to the private wing, where I go to see a day-old baby girl and her mother. Here I am offered champagne. What crude contrasts between the opposite ends of both the life cycle and the health care spectrum these are, and sloping off towards the tube through the late afternoon drizzle I feel a bit like Alan Bennett, only without the wit and acuity to do these contrasts justice. Tuesday: On the way to work, I pass the old Grove health clinic in Goldhawk Road, an employment agency agency now, but still a ringer for a curiously above-ground nuclear shelter. It was here a decade ago that I first met Dr Sarah Jarvis when I took my chest x-rays for her inspection. It feels like 10 years, too.

      "body": "<p>A UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague today convicted three Bosnian Serbs on charges of rape and torture, the first case of wartime sexual enslavement to come before an international court.</p> <p>The tribunal convicted Dragoljub Kunarac of sexually assaulting and torturing Muslim women at rape camps during the Bosnian war, sentencing him to 28 years in prison. The court said Kunarac was involved in a \"nightmarish scheme of sexual exploitation\" that was \"especially repugnant\".</p> <p>\"You abused and ravaged Muslim women because of their ethnicity, and from among their number you picked whomsoever you fancied,\" said the presiding judge, reading the first verdict.</p> <p>The second defendant, Radomir Kovac, was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity by rape and sentenced to 20 years.</p> <p>The final defendant, Zoran Vukovic, was convicted of raping and torturing a 15-year-old girl - who was about the same age as his own daughter - but was acquitted on most other charges for lack of evidence. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.</p> <p>Florence Mumba, the presiding judge, went through the testimony of woman after woman who had told horrendous tales of rape and torture in the Bosnian town of Foca, southeast of Sarajevo. Muslims were herded into separate prison camps for men and women after the town was overrun in April 1992.</p> <p>The verdict follows months of testimony from dozens of witnesses, including 16 former rape victims who came to The Hague to confront their alleged former tormentors.</p> <p>The women told how Bosnian Serb paramilitary soldiers entered detention centres and selected women and girls as young as 12 for nightly gang rapes and sexual torture. They were charged with about 50 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including rape, torture, enslavement and outrages upon personal dignity. The crimes carried maximum life sentences.</p> <p>Some witnesses sobbed and others shrieked with rage as they recalled being assaulted by up to 10 soldiers at a time in classrooms of the high school where they were detained or in soldiers' private apartments - so-called \"rape camps\".</p> <p>Judge Mumba said the defendants carried out their rapes in full knowledge of the systematic attack against the Muslim population ordered by the Bosnian Serb leadership.</p> <p>They were not \"political or military masterminds behind the conflicts and atrocities,\" she said. \"However, they thrived in the dark atmosphere of the dehumanisation of those believed to be enemies.\"</p> <p>The tribunal was established by the UN Security Council in 1993 to go after the alleged architects of the Bosnian war's bloody \"ethnic cleansing\" campaigns, including the former Bosnian Serb president, Radovan Karadzic, and his military chief, Ratko Mladic, who remain at large.</p> <p>However, prosecutors indicted the three irregular soldiers to spotlight the widespread use of rape as a weapon throughout the 1992-1995 war. Human rights groups have estimated that tens of thousands of people, mainly Muslim woman and girls, were raped in the war. The sexual assaults were designed to intimidate Muslim families into flight and force women to bear Serb babies.</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/serbia/0,2759,221850,00.html\">Special report: Serbia</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Kosovo/0,2759,180467,00.html\">Special report: Kosovo</a><br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yugo/article/0,2763,440317,00.html\">20.02.2001: Hunting Radovan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4010486,00.html\">21.04.2000: UN tribunal told of Bosnian rape camp horrors</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3976419,00.html\">21.03.2000: Serbs 'enslaved Muslim women at rape camps'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yugo/article/0,2763,181290,00.html\">War crimes tribunal explained</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"www.un.org/icty/latest.htm\" target=\"_new\">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a><br> <a href=\"www.serbia-info.com/news/1999-12/23/16375.html\" target=\"_new\">Serbian Information Centre condemnation of The Hague tribunals</a><br> <a href=\"www.hrw.org/reports98/foca\" target=\"_new\">Human Rights Watch report on Foca</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague today convicted three Bosnian Serbs on charges of rape and torture, the first case of wartime sexual enslavement to come before an international court. The tribunal convicted Dragoljub Kunarac of sexually assaulting and torturing Muslim women at rape camps during the Bosnian war, sentencing him to 28 years in prison. The court said Kunarac was involved in a \"nightmarish scheme of sexual exploitation\" that was \"especially repugnant\". \"You abused and ravaged Muslim women because of their ethnicity, and from among their number you picked whomsoever you fancied,\" said the presiding judge, reading the first verdict. The second defendant, Radomir Kovac, was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity by rape and sentenced to 20 years. The final defendant, Zoran Vukovic, was convicted of raping and torturing a 15-year-old girl - who was about the same age as his own daughter - but was acquitted on most other charges for lack of evidence. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. Florence Mumba, the presiding judge, went through the testimony of woman after woman who had told horrendous tales of rape and torture in the Bosnian town of Foca, southeast of Sarajevo. Muslims were herded into separate prison camps for men and women after the town was overrun in April 1992. The verdict follows months of testimony from dozens of witnesses, including 16 former rape victims who came to The Hague to confront their alleged former tormentors. The women told how Bosnian Serb paramilitary soldiers entered detention centres and selected women and girls as young as 12 for nightly gang rapes and sexual torture. They were charged with about 50 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including rape, torture, enslavement and outrages upon personal dignity. The crimes carried maximum life sentences. Some witnesses sobbed and others shrieked with rage as they recalled being assaulted by up to 10 soldiers at a time in classrooms of the high school where they were detained or in soldiers' private apartments - so-called \"rape camps\". Judge Mumba said the defendants carried out their rapes in full knowledge of the systematic attack against the Muslim population ordered by the Bosnian Serb leadership. They were not \"political or military masterminds behind the conflicts and atrocities,\" she said. \"However, they thrived in the dark atmosphere of the dehumanisation of those believed to be enemies.\" The tribunal was established by the UN Security Council in 1993 to go after the alleged architects of the Bosnian war's bloody \"ethnic cleansing\" campaigns, including the former Bosnian Serb president, Radovan Karadzic, and his military chief, Ratko Mladic, who remain at large. However, prosecutors indicted the three irregular soldiers to spotlight the widespread use of rape as a weapon throughout the 1992-1995 war. Human rights groups have estimated that tens of thousands of people, mainly Muslim woman and girls, were raped in the war. The sexual assaults were designed to intimidate Muslim families into flight and force women to bear Serb babies.

The site also picks up the urgent appeal by National Farmers' Union chairman Ben Gill for the public to stay away from countryside areas containing livestock.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Farmer's Weekly Interactive</a> site is also dominated by dire warnings of devastation in the meat and livestock industry. Last year, according to the Meat and Livestock Commission, Britain exported 764,000 live sheep and 94,000 tonnes of lamb, together worth \u00a3212m. Also, 97,000 live pigs and 219,400 tonnes of pig meat were exported with a total value of \u00a3183.4m.</p> <p>Sheep farmers are worried that, with the loss of continental markets, home-produced lamb will flood the domestic market, driving down prices. And now farmers are worried about the implications for animal welfare, if livestock has to be kept back on farms because abattoirs decide it is not worth killing without a market.</p> <p>In its breaking news section, Farmer's Weekly Interactive reports that infected meat is now thought to be the most likely source of the outbreak. The excellent site run by the <a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net/\" target=\"_NEW\">National Pig Association</a> reflects the desperation of producers, by leading with a prayer submitted by the Rev Alan Robson, an agricultural chaplain in Lincolnshire. It concludes rather plaintively: \"As we unravel the mistakes may we learn the lessons, whatever they may be. Above all as we seek to support each other through this time may we simply rediscover how precious is our dependence on each other. Amen.\"</p> <p>The site addresses the urgent question of compensation, noting that even farmers with healthy animals can be driven quickly to bankruptcy, if he cannot get his stock to market: \"Unable to move the animals, farmers must nevertheless continue to feed them, until the money runs out, or pay to have them slaughtered\u0085 Over the next week, the farming industry will want to ensure that on this occasion full compensation is available to farmers with zone-trapped animals.\"</p> <p>The NPA also makes a poignant appeal to journalists to spread the message that the disease is horribly infectious: \"Can we ask you to stress to your readers/listeners/viewers the importance of staying away from livestock farms for the time being.

      "bodyText": "The Farmer's Guardian trade weekly gloomily reports that the export ban will cost the industry \u00a38m a week. The site also picks up the urgent appeal by National Farmers' Union chairman Ben Gill for the public to stay away from countryside areas containing livestock. The Farmer's Weekly Interactive site is also dominated by dire warnings of devastation in the meat and livestock industry. Last year, according to the Meat and Livestock Commission, Britain exported 764,000 live sheep and 94,000 tonnes of lamb, together worth \u00a3212m. Also, 97,000 live pigs and 219,400 tonnes of pig meat were exported with a total value of \u00a3183.4m. Sheep farmers are worried that, with the loss of continental markets, home-produced lamb will flood the domestic market, driving down prices. And now farmers are worried about the implications for animal welfare, if livestock has to be kept back on farms because abattoirs decide it is not worth killing without a market. In its breaking news section, Farmer's Weekly Interactive reports that infected meat is now thought to be the most likely source of the outbreak. The excellent site run by the National Pig Association reflects the desperation of producers, by leading with a prayer submitted by the Rev Alan Robson, an agricultural chaplain in Lincolnshire. It concludes rather plaintively: \"As we unravel the mistakes may we learn the lessons, whatever they may be. Above all as we seek to support each other through this time may we simply rediscover how precious is our dependence on each other. Amen.\" The site addresses the urgent question of compensation, noting that even farmers with healthy animals can be driven quickly to bankruptcy, if he cannot get his stock to market: \"Unable to move the animals, farmers must nevertheless continue to feed them, until the money runs out, or pay to have them slaughtered\u0085 Over the next week, the farming industry will want to ensure that on this occasion full compensation is available to farmers with zone-trapped animals.\" The NPA also makes a poignant appeal to journalists to spread the message that the disease is horribly infectious: \"Can we ask you to stress to your readers/listeners/viewers the importance of staying away from livestock farms for the time being. Foot and mouth is extraordinarily infectious and until it is known where the source of the outbreak is, any casual visit to any farm could potentially spread the disease. \"For instance, if a passer by were to 'talk' over the fence to an infected sow, lamb, or an inquisitive heifer, the virus would reach his or her nose where it would remain for up to two days. During this period if he or she were to come into close contact with any other susceptible animal, the disease would be spread.\" Email dbrown445@aol.com Talk about it What do you think?

      "body": "<p>An immediate ban on all UK animal exports was imposed last night following the confirmation of highly contagious foot and mouth disease in pigs and cattle at an Essex farm and abattoir. It brought another hammer blow to Britain's depressed farming industry.</p> <p>The export ban, agreed between the European Union and the UK immediately the outbreak was confirmed, will cost farmers and food producers \u00a31m a day in live animal and food products, including dairy products.</p> <p>The source of the disease is unknown but is so virulent it can spread on the wind. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, last night asked all farmers to check their stock, and said the government's priority was to stop the outbreak.</p> <p>\"Potentially this is a very, very serious situation,\" Mr Brown said. \"We will slaughter all the infected animals and destroy all the carcasses. We will act swiftly, firmly and comprehensively. We have to get on top of this outbreak.\"</p> <p>It is the first foot and mouth outbreak since a small one in 1981, but brought memories of 1967, when 2,500 farms were affected and hundreds of thousands of cattle, sheep, pigs and goats were destroyed over a six-month period.</p> <p>\"The outbreak has potentially catastrophic implications for the whole of the British livestock industry,\" said Ben Gill, the National Farmers Union president.</p> <p>\"The priority now is to contain it and we fully support all the measures which have been speedily put in place by Maff [the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]. While these measures will be devastating to the farms involved, it is in the interests of the whole UK livestock industry that this disease is stopped dead in its tracks.\"</p> <p>Sixty cattle and 300 pigs were being slaughtered at Cheale Meats in Little Warley, south of Brentwood, where 27 pigs developed the disease on Monday. A bull at a nearby farm owned by the same company was confirmed with the disease on Tuesday night and three more cattle had developed symptoms yesterday.</p> <p>Jim Scudamore, the government's chief vet, said the strain of the virus had been identified as Type O, a most virulent pan-Asiatic strain that develops within 48 hours of infection. \"This means this outbreak could spread extremely fast,\" he said. \"We have no idea of its origin or where the infection in Essex came from.</p> <p>\"It can spread many miles by air to other species, by touch, or frequently by lorry which has carried other infected animals. The next 48 hours are crucial.\"</p> <p>Three farms which sent pigs for slaughter in Essex were under restrictions last night. Two at Great Horwood in Buckinghamshire and Freshwater Bay on the Isle of Wight were placed in a three-mile exclusion zones. A Selby farm which sent one of the infected pig was restricted but without an exclusion zone, because the pig had arrived at the abattoir so late on Sunday night that vets do not believe it could have caused the illness in the other pigs.</p> <p>Mr Scudamore said none of the animals on the quarantined farms had become ill, so they were not suspected of being the source of the outbreak. \"We are keeping them under restrictions as a precaution but we are looking elsewhere for the source of the outbreak and we know we have not found it yet.\"</p> <p>A fourth farm at Stroud in Gloucestershire was placed under precautions because animals were ill, but there was no confirmation that the illness was foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>The plight of the affected farmers was illustrated by Rachael Fidler, whose husband runs Faringford farm at Freshwater Bay. She was at work when the restrictions were imposed and cannot go home to her husband and two children. \"It is devastating,\" she said. \"I could go to the farm but it would mean I would not be able to leave, so I am currently having to stay with neighbours.\"</p> <p>Dozens of farms as far away as Northern Ireland and Scotland, which have sent animals to the slaughterhouse in the past three weeks were being investigated last night. All farms visited by lorries from the abattoir were being tracked to make sure the infection had not been passed on.</p> <p>Mr Brown said the source of the outbreak was almost certainly the result of illegal activity. \"It is almost impossible to visualise how this could have happened as a result of a series of legal transactions,\" he said. \"Something illegal has happened to bring this into the country.\"</p> <p>Lady Hayman, the junior agriculture minister, told the House of Lords that although humans could get the disease, it was rare and not fatal.</p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">Special report: what's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Special report: countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><br><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,2763,441336,00.html\">22.02.2001: Farms: yet another crisis</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,2763,441311,00.html\">22.02.2001: How the export ban will bite</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,2763,441177,00.html\">22.02.2001, leader: Down on the farm</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,2763,441026,00.html\">21.02.2001, analysis: Pig farmers penned in</a></p> <p><b>Background</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/0,6514,180991,00.html\">21.02.2001, the issue explained: Foot-and-mouth disease</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">21.02.2001, NetNotes: Pigs</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">National Farmers Union</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net\" target=\"_new\">National Pig Association</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" target=\"_new\">World organisation for animal health: foot-and-mouth disease</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "An immediate ban on all UK animal exports was imposed last night following the confirmation of highly contagious foot and mouth disease in pigs and cattle at an Essex farm and abattoir. It brought another hammer blow to Britain's depressed farming industry. The export ban, agreed between the European Union and the UK immediately the outbreak was confirmed, will cost farmers and food producers \u00a31m a day in live animal and food products, including dairy products. The source of the disease is unknown but is so virulent it can spread on the wind. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, last night asked all farmers to check their stock, and said the government's priority was to stop the outbreak. \"Potentially this is a very, very serious situation,\" Mr Brown said. \"We will slaughter all the infected animals and destroy all the carcasses. We will act swiftly, firmly and comprehensively. We have to get on top of this outbreak.\" It is the first foot and mouth outbreak since a small one in 1981, but brought memories of 1967, when 2,500 farms were affected and hundreds of thousands of cattle, sheep, pigs and goats were destroyed over a six-month period. \"The outbreak has potentially catastrophic implications for the whole of the British livestock industry,\" said Ben Gill, the National Farmers Union president. \"The priority now is to contain it and we fully support all the measures which have been speedily put in place by Maff [the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]. While these measures will be devastating to the farms involved, it is in the interests of the whole UK livestock industry that this disease is stopped dead in its tracks.\" Sixty cattle and 300 pigs were being slaughtered at Cheale Meats in Little Warley, south of Brentwood, where 27 pigs developed the disease on Monday. A bull at a nearby farm owned by the same company was confirmed with the disease on Tuesday night and three more cattle had developed symptoms yesterday. Jim Scudamore, the government's chief vet, said the strain of the virus had been identified as Type O, a most virulent pan-Asiatic strain that develops within 48 hours of infection. \"This means this outbreak could spread extremely fast,\" he said. \"We have no idea of its origin or where the infection in Essex came from. \"It can spread many miles by air to other species, by touch, or frequently by lorry which has carried other infected animals. The next 48 hours are crucial.\" Three farms which sent pigs for slaughter in Essex were under restrictions last night. Two at Great Horwood in Buckinghamshire and Freshwater Bay on the Isle of Wight were placed in a three-mile exclusion zones. A Selby farm which sent one of the infected pig was restricted but without an exclusion zone, because the pig had arrived at the abattoir so late on Sunday night that vets do not believe it could have caused the illness in the other pigs. Mr Scudamore said none of the animals on the quarantined farms had become ill, so they were not suspected of being the source of the outbreak. \"We are keeping them under restrictions as a precaution but we are looking elsewhere for the source of the outbreak and we know we have not found it yet.\" A fourth farm at Stroud in Gloucestershire was placed under precautions because animals were ill, but there was no confirmation that the illness was foot and mouth disease. The plight of the affected farmers was illustrated by Rachael Fidler, whose husband runs Faringford farm at Freshwater Bay. She was at work when the restrictions were imposed and cannot go home to her husband and two children. \"It is devastating,\" she said. \"I could go to the farm but it would mean I would not be able to leave, so I am currently having to stay with neighbours.\" Dozens of farms as far away as Northern Ireland and Scotland, which have sent animals to the slaughterhouse in the past three weeks were being investigated last night. All farms visited by lorries from the abattoir were being tracked to make sure the infection had not been passed on. Mr Brown said the source of the outbreak was almost certainly the result of illegal activity. \"It is almost impossible to visualise how this could have happened as a result of a series of legal transactions,\" he said. \"Something illegal has happened to bring this into the country.\" Lady Hayman, the junior agriculture minister, told the House of Lords that although humans could get the disease, it was rare and not fatal.

      "byline": "David Rowley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Internet auctions were one of the web's earliest successes and the benefits are clear - no more tiny classified ads, no more unwinnable arguments with second hand dealers and no more musty collector emporiums. They are also, you should be warned, very addictive. </p> <p>While some publicity has been attracted to merchant auctions such as the bit by bit sale of Wembley Stadium by <a href=\"http://www.qxl.com\">www.qxl.com</a>, the classic, original and still most popular internet auction is the one that lasts seven days, held between ordinary members of the public and typified by those at <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk\">www.ebay.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>Common auction logic says that your first step should be as a buyer. The buyer has less to do than the seller and through their first auction gets a feel for the greater responsibilities of the seller. Before you can place a bid though there are some legal niceties. Unlike the seemingly pointless chore that is the registration page at internet shopping sites, at auction sites this page binds you to a contract, which states that any bids placed on the site must be honoured. </p> <p>There is also the business of finding your self a user ID. My own instinct on this is that a sensible or even a dull name is more likely to inspire confidence in those looking to buy, say a \u00a3500 laptop from you. This theory can of course be junked if you consider that Parrothead88 is the user ID of the most prolific internet auction user ever - 26,500 auctions completed at <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\">www.ebay.com</a>. </p> <p>Now you are ready to bid, which is the easy part. Check the descriptions and photo carefully and the shipping costs. If anything is unclear, use the \"ask seller a question\" link before, and not after, you bid. </p> <p>As a buyer you will have a natural anxiety over sending a cheque in the post to someone you know very little about. Why shouldn't they just take the money and run? This is possible, but unlikely. Firstly, every auction user should have the number of successful trades they have completed next to their user ID. Anyone with at least 20 of these feedback points is a good bet. </p> <p>Secondly, trust your common sense over what looks suspicious. Most internet auction frauds concern the sale of fake luxury goods particularly Rolex watches. </p> <p>A third safeguard is provided by sites such as <a href=\"http://www.iescrow.com\">www.iescrow.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tradesafe.com\" target=\"_new\">www.tradesafe.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">www.paypal.com</a> which provide escrow services that ensure no money is handed over until the goods arrive. <a href=\"http://www.qxl.com\">QXL</a> runs its very own escrow service, while <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\">www.ebay.com</a> is shortly getting round to providing such a service too. </p> <p>Lastly, as extra insurance, eBay, Amazon auctions and QXL all offer a compensation scheme for those who are conned out of amounts up to \u00a3120 at eBay and \u00a3150 at QXL and Amazon. </p> <p>If this has reassured you, now place your bid by clicking on the link provided: it is at the bottom of the page at eBay. Again, anxiety about getting yourself involved in some whirlwind bidding war can be allayed. Many auctions will only attract a single bid; others at the most usually three or four bids. </p> <p>If you decide that the item on view must be yours come what may, you should make use of your auction sites automatic bidding device. This works by letting you state in secrecy the highest amount you are willing to spend. Each time you are outbid, the Auto bid as it is often known (at eBay it is called proxy bidding) will up your bid by a prearranged increment. Even if you do not use this, most auction sites will email you whenever you are outbid. </p> <p>Lastly, for buyers there is another nifty tool that eBay pioneered called the Personal Shopper page, which can be found under the buyer and seller services link. This is for those looking for anything that they cannot see on the website. Tell the \"personal shopper\" what you are looking for and they should email you automatically whenever something of that description is listed for auction. </p> <p>Meanwhile, selling requires more strategy and work. Unlike the speedy process of bidding, setting up your own auction, especially your first, takes time and patience. </p> <p>Most grief is caused by putting photos on to an auction - so much so, that many forgo them altogether. Yet while it is possible to sell items without a photo, the lack of one will lose you bids and a good sale price. </p> <p>Your first step is to get the image onto your desktop. A digital camera is ideal, though a scanner can be used for flat items and conventionally taken photos. You could also try your photo developing service, most of which should be able to put your photos onto a disc or park them on the web. This latter service is handy as photos put on your desktop by a digital camera, scanner or disc next have to be put on the web. eBay offers a cheap and speedy service for this, though I have always found the free service offered by <a href=\"http://www.auctionwatch.com\">www.auctionwatch.com</a> quite adequate. </p> <p>Price your item slightly less than what you hope to get for it: 10-20% less is recommended. A low price will attract more bidders who may bid up your item to your ideal price, if not above. Include in the price your shipping and packaging costs, which should be broken down in your description. Bear in mind also the small charge or percentage taken by the auction site. </p> <p>When writing your advert always put in a few emotive words and phrases - such as, for example, good as new, rare, shiny, in original wrapping, bonus and free - where they are warranted. Write the ad before going online and cut and paste it onto the site. </p> <p>Now click the Submit button and your auction is underway. To keep up with it easily on a daily basis, go to your auction page and right click with your mouse on the \"create a shortcut\" option to creatre a direct link to this page on your desktop. </p> <p>Do not get dispirited if you receive no bids for several days. It is quite common to receive most of your bids on the final day, and sometimes in the final hours of an auction. eBay's current spin on the number of successful auctions is that at least a half of all auctions on their site find a buyer, and this is the highest ratio for any site. This will, however, depend on what you are selling. The hottest categories are in collectables and computers.

      "bodyText": "Internet auctions were one of the web's earliest successes and the benefits are clear - no more tiny classified ads, no more unwinnable arguments with second hand dealers and no more musty collector emporiums. They are also, you should be warned, very addictive. While some publicity has been attracted to merchant auctions such as the bit by bit sale of Wembley Stadium by www.qxl.com, the classic, original and still most popular internet auction is the one that lasts seven days, held between ordinary members of the public and typified by those at www.ebay.co.uk. Common auction logic says that your first step should be as a buyer. The buyer has less to do than the seller and through their first auction gets a feel for the greater responsibilities of the seller. Before you can place a bid though there are some legal niceties. Unlike the seemingly pointless chore that is the registration page at internet shopping sites, at auction sites this page binds you to a contract, which states that any bids placed on the site must be honoured. There is also the business of finding your self a user ID. My own instinct on this is that a sensible or even a dull name is more likely to inspire confidence in those looking to buy, say a \u00a3500 laptop from you. This theory can of course be junked if you consider that Parrothead88 is the user ID of the most prolific internet auction user ever - 26,500 auctions completed at www.ebay.com. Now you are ready to bid, which is the easy part. Check the descriptions and photo carefully and the shipping costs. If anything is unclear, use the \"ask seller a question\" link before, and not after, you bid. As a buyer you will have a natural anxiety over sending a cheque in the post to someone you know very little about. Why shouldn't they just take the money and run? This is possible, but unlikely. Firstly, every auction user should have the number of successful trades they have completed next to their user ID. Anyone with at least 20 of these feedback points is a good bet. Secondly, trust your common sense over what looks suspicious. Most internet auction frauds concern the sale of fake luxury goods particularly Rolex watches. A third safeguard is provided by sites such as www.iescrow.com, www.tradesafe.com and www.paypal.com which provide escrow services that ensure no money is handed over until the goods arrive. QXL runs its very own escrow service, while www.ebay.com is shortly getting round to providing such a service too. Lastly, as extra insurance, eBay, Amazon auctions and QXL all offer a compensation scheme for those who are conned out of amounts up to \u00a3120 at eBay and \u00a3150 at QXL and Amazon. If this has reassured you, now place your bid by clicking on the link provided: it is at the bottom of the page at eBay. Again, anxiety about getting yourself involved in some whirlwind bidding war can be allayed. Many auctions will only attract a single bid; others at the most usually three or four bids. If you decide that the item on view must be yours come what may, you should make use of your auction sites automatic bidding device. This works by letting you state in secrecy the highest amount you are willing to spend. Each time you are outbid, the Auto bid as it is often known (at eBay it is called proxy bidding) will up your bid by a prearranged increment. Even if you do not use this, most auction sites will email you whenever you are outbid. Lastly, for buyers there is another nifty tool that eBay pioneered called the Personal Shopper page, which can be found under the buyer and seller services link. This is for those looking for anything that they cannot see on the website. Tell the \"personal shopper\" what you are looking for and they should email you automatically whenever something of that description is listed for auction. Meanwhile, selling requires more strategy and work. Unlike the speedy process of bidding, setting up your own auction, especially your first, takes time and patience. Most grief is caused by putting photos on to an auction - so much so, that many forgo them altogether. Yet while it is possible to sell items without a photo, the lack of one will lose you bids and a good sale price. Your first step is to get the image onto your desktop. A digital camera is ideal, though a scanner can be used for flat items and conventionally taken photos. You could also try your photo developing service, most of which should be able to put your photos onto a disc or park them on the web. This latter service is handy as photos put on your desktop by a digital camera, scanner or disc next have to be put on the web. eBay offers a cheap and speedy service for this, though I have always found the free service offered by www.auctionwatch.com quite adequate. Price your item slightly less than what you hope to get for it: 10-20% less is recommended. A low price will attract more bidders who may bid up your item to your ideal price, if not above. Include in the price your shipping and packaging costs, which should be broken down in your description. Bear in mind also the small charge or percentage taken by the auction site. When writing your advert always put in a few emotive words and phrases - such as, for example, good as new, rare, shiny, in original wrapping, bonus and free - where they are warranted. Write the ad before going online and cut and paste it onto the site. Now click the Submit button and your auction is underway. To keep up with it easily on a daily basis, go to your auction page and right click with your mouse on the \"create a shortcut\" option to creatre a direct link to this page on your desktop. Do not get dispirited if you receive no bids for several days. It is quite common to receive most of your bids on the final day, and sometimes in the final hours of an auction. eBay's current spin on the number of successful auctions is that at least a half of all auctions on their site find a buyer, and this is the highest ratio for any site. This will, however, depend on what you are selling. The hottest categories are in collectables and computers. Household appliances, in my experience, sell very poorly. Once the auction ends, the onus is on the seller to contact the buyer with their real world address and phone number. The worst problem a seller faces is a recalcitrant or deadbeat bidder who is slow or reluctant to complete a deal. Be warned: disputes at this stage must be sorted out by yourself. The auction site does not have the manpower or the inclination to deal with this. Once payment from the seller arrives, send off your auction item promptly and wait for the glowing feedback to arrive. \u0095 David Rowley is the author of The Virgin Internet Auction Guide, \u00a35.99.

An emergency ban on the export of meat and live animals was introduced last night following the first outbreak of foot and mouth disease for 20 years.</p> <p>A five-mile exclusion zone has been set up round an Essex abattoir, where vets have found 27 pigs infected with the disease, and a neighbouring farm, where cattle have been found to be infected.</p> <p>Two other farms - on the Isle of Wight and in Buckinghamshire - which supplied the abattoir with pigs, plus a fourth farm in Gloucestershire, are also in quarantine. Dozens more are being examined.</p> <p>The moves may seem draconian, but there are few more virulent viruses than foot and mouth. The last major epidemic, in 1967, spread rapidly across Shropshire, Cheshire and Wales, infecting 2,346 farms in an eight-month period and requiring 433,000 animals to be slaughtered before it was eliminated.</p> <p>Infection can spread via vehicle tyres, human feet, contact with diseased animals or even through the air. Rats and even starlings were thought to have been involved in spreading the 1967 epidemic. Hence the five mile exclusion zones. The wife of the Isle of Wight farmer whose pigs are suspect was stranded outside her farm yesterday and staying with neighbours. It could take up to 10 days to clarify whether the farm was a source of the infection.</p> <p>The new food standards agency rightly moved quickly to reassure the public yesterday that the disease posed no serious threat to the human food chain. The disease is confined to animals with cloven hooves. Nor can intensive factory farming methods be blamed for this outbreak.</p> <p>The disease dates back at least 150 years, long before farmers began speeding up growth by turning natural herbivores, such as cows, into meat eating animals by feeding them minced up meat ends and chicken litter - a procedure now banned following the BSE scandal.

      "bodyText": "A new nightmare is threatening British farmers, already reeling from BSE-infected cattle, the fall in lamb prices and swine fever. An emergency ban on the export of meat and live animals was introduced last night following the first outbreak of foot and mouth disease for 20 years. A five-mile exclusion zone has been set up round an Essex abattoir, where vets have found 27 pigs infected with the disease, and a neighbouring farm, where cattle have been found to be infected. Two other farms - on the Isle of Wight and in Buckinghamshire - which supplied the abattoir with pigs, plus a fourth farm in Gloucestershire, are also in quarantine. Dozens more are being examined. The moves may seem draconian, but there are few more virulent viruses than foot and mouth. The last major epidemic, in 1967, spread rapidly across Shropshire, Cheshire and Wales, infecting 2,346 farms in an eight-month period and requiring 433,000 animals to be slaughtered before it was eliminated. Infection can spread via vehicle tyres, human feet, contact with diseased animals or even through the air. Rats and even starlings were thought to have been involved in spreading the 1967 epidemic. Hence the five mile exclusion zones. The wife of the Isle of Wight farmer whose pigs are suspect was stranded outside her farm yesterday and staying with neighbours. It could take up to 10 days to clarify whether the farm was a source of the infection. The new food standards agency rightly moved quickly to reassure the public yesterday that the disease posed no serious threat to the human food chain. The disease is confined to animals with cloven hooves. Nor can intensive factory farming methods be blamed for this outbreak. The disease dates back at least 150 years, long before farmers began speeding up growth by turning natural herbivores, such as cows, into meat eating animals by feeding them minced up meat ends and chicken litter - a procedure now banned following the BSE scandal. Undoubtedly the hygiene of the food chain, from farm through processors, distributors and retailers, could still be improved, but foot and mouth cannot be blamed on a dirty food chain. There was a small infection in 1981, which was quickly snuffed out with a rigorous quarantine regime and the slaughter of animals on suspect farms. Ministers ought to re-examine the alternative approach, used by some European states, of vaccinating animals against the disease. Meanwhile, the National Farmers Union fully supported the government's moves: \"While these measures will be devastating to the farms involved, it is in the interests of the whole UK livestock industry that this disease is stopped dead in its track.\" Maintaining this cooperation is crucial. The most effective way will be to ensure that, unlike their treatment in 1967, compensation for affected farmers is fair and comprehensive.

Orange, BTCellnet and Vodafone are supporting a self-regulating code of practice to stop companies sending unsolicited messages. The code, drawn up by new body the Wireless Marketing Association, bans spamming and states all wireless marketing must be permission-based. But the WMA admits the code will be difficult to enforce. There are no controls on non-WMA members because mobile phone marketing is not regulated by any other body. The body hopes advertisers will conform to the standards. However, Steve Wunker, WAM chairman and chief executive of Savafone, said: \"If it pays to send a 30p unsolicited mailer through consumers' doors - which will only be read by 2% of people - it will pay to send a 5p text message that will be read by everyone who receives it.\" The code also establishes that mobile phone users who don't want to receive messages or promotions must opt out rather than opt in. The WMA will also set up a customer complaints system and a consumer protection committee. The promoters of a message must be identified clearly and all information on recipients must be held securely and be made available to them on request. If WMA members contravene the code they must correct their campaign or risk expulsion. The use of mobile phones to target consumers with messages about services, products and promotions is set to rocket as new generation mobile technology allows more sophisticated data and graphics to be sent to phones. McDonald's, American Express and lastminute.com are trialling mobile phone text messaging promotions and advertising as a way of interacting directly with consumers. The WMA was founded in October last year and is seeking to set standards for wireless marketing. Its board consists of executives from seven mobile phone companies, including Anne de Kerckhove, managing director of 12snap. Mr Wunker said: \"We believe we've put the right and proper safeguards in place to make sure wireless marketing isn't abused. \"It's a powerful tool that is set to take off on a massive scale. As an industry we take that potential seriously.\" Feb 22: January text messaging breaks records",

      "body": "<p> <strong> Phantasy Star Online </strong> <br> Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Sega ***** <br> It is up there with trainspotting and learning Klingon, but online gaming has finally broken free from geekdom. The reason is Phantasy Star Online: the world's first console-based online role playing game (RPG). Unlike the bearded fantasy cliches of PC titles such as Everquest, PSO offers a colourful futuristic environment, albeit with a limp sci-fi plot. </p> <p>Despite a manual twice the size of most console games, PSO is wonderfully easy to pick up but has enough depth to satisfy serious stat-addicts. Your first task is to create your character and it is wise to spend time on this. You could patiently weigh up the combat or magic potential, or just play around with hair colours. It is this great dichotomy between accessibility and complexity that makes PSO such a revelation. </p> <p>The next choice is simple - on or offline. Offline play lets you build up your character and undertake some interesting side-missions but the only way to truly play Phantasy Star is online. Getting connected is a cinch and before long you will be creating your own team or joining another. Then it is time for some planetside monster-bashing. As you cannot harm your team mates, co-operation is all and combat strategy is essential for success. </p> <p>Thankfully communication is easy, with instant translation into five languages, and standard icons used to create an unrivalled team atmosphere. In fact, the communication element is perhaps the biggest achievement of PSO, taking the relatively simple hack'n'slash gameplay to a new level. </p> <p>Sumptuous graphics are the icing on the cake and the only downside to Phantasy Star Online is cost. With the average session lasting more than an hour, you can expect heavy phone bills. In this rare case, they are worth it. (GH)</p> <p><strong> Three Kingdoms: Fate of the Dragon</strong> <br>PC CD-Rom \u00a329.99 Overmax/Eidos Interactive *** <br> After Civilization, Age of Empires, and the legion of inferior imitators, the historical real-time strategy game seemed a used-up genre. </p> <p>Three Kingdoms is not about to change that. Sure, the setting is rich and colourful. The game takes us back to second century China, where three warlords are engaged in a fierce battle for control of the fragmented empire. Using an isometric view, you can play as any of the three, each of whom has unique forces at his disposal. You know the shtick. </p> <p>In order to build up those forces, you must first develop your home city by chopping wood, mining, building farms, and training peasants. Yay. Resource management. Has no one yet told games designers that resource management is the opposite of fun? Some of us have enough trouble remembering to buy milk, for goodness sake. </p> <p>Anyway, once the city is up and running, things get slightly more enjoyable as you send out your troops, occupy county towns, besiege enemy cities and invent new technologies. You know. The usual. (One tiny difference here is that you must remember to keep your troops supplied with food or they will weaken and become useless in battle. Personally, I would rather spend a little longer training the soldiers until they were intelligent enough to forage for themselves.) </p> <p>Military might is not the only route to victory, however. You can also win by making more scientific progress than your rivals, or by skilful use of trade and diplomacy. Hey, there has to be somebody out there who wants to try that. </p> <p>Graphically speaking, it is pretty and the soundtrack is marginally preferable to having a plate scraped in your ear. </p> <p>I know, I know, I have just described every historical RTS you have ever seen. But then, that is what this is. A dead horse being flogged, albeit in a competent and moderately entertaining way. (AB)</p> <p><strong> Globetrotter</strong> <br>PC \u00a329.99 Vsion Park/EA * <br> In many ways there's something charming about Globetrotter, in that it harks back to days when games were a cottage industry and A-list titles frequently arrived with photocopied instructions and labels stuck to cassettes by the programmer's mum. Globetrotter turned up looking decidedly low-budget and boasting the most useless insert ever seen - a poorly drawn departure schedule. Not a promising start. </p> <p>But wait. Having installed it, up popped a very professional video montage of people travelling to exotic locations, easily up to Lonely Planet titles and accompanied by some funky original music. Perhaps I have judged this too early? </p> <p>Nah - it's rubbish. Video over, the game kicks in with hilarious results. Imagine Pokemon Snap without the 3D engine, with gigantic characters strutting across unconvincing, out-of-scale maps. Every level involves much the same thing: you have to go to a location and take photos of it, returning to base or travelling elsewhere within a set time limit. Some places can be walked to (simply point on the map and click); others need train, plane or boat connections. Along the way, you may be asked one of 4,000 simple trivia questions loosely based on local history. For instance, in London we are asked what performance led to the rise of the Beatles. Yes, it is the Ed Sullivan show - and that's London summed up, don't you think? </p> <p>In fairness, there is the potential here for quite an interesting game, perhaps using a Sim City-style engine. But alas there are far too many problems to be cured by a simple makeover. </p> <p>As a game, Globetrotter's credentials are uncertain; as a travel aid it is one stage below chronically inept. For example, although major bridges are pointed out on the map, characters can still wade through rivers leaving tell-tale splashes in their wake. Somehow, being able to choose their sex (it makes no difference to the gameplay, of course) fails to make up for so many laws of physics, geography and common sense being broken all at once. </p> <p>All in all, Globetrotter looks and plays like a school project and cannot be recommended even to lovers of kitsch (which it so nearly is). </p> <p>Whoever Vision Park is, this merely adds weight to the claim that developing videogames is a big boy's game these days.

      "bodyText": "Phantasy Star Online Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Sega ***** It is up there with trainspotting and learning Klingon, but online gaming has finally broken free from geekdom. The reason is Phantasy Star Online: the world's first console-based online role playing game (RPG). Unlike the bearded fantasy cliches of PC titles such as Everquest, PSO offers a colourful futuristic environment, albeit with a limp sci-fi plot. Despite a manual twice the size of most console games, PSO is wonderfully easy to pick up but has enough depth to satisfy serious stat-addicts. Your first task is to create your character and it is wise to spend time on this. You could patiently weigh up the combat or magic potential, or just play around with hair colours. It is this great dichotomy between accessibility and complexity that makes PSO such a revelation. The next choice is simple - on or offline. Offline play lets you build up your character and undertake some interesting side-missions but the only way to truly play Phantasy Star is online. Getting connected is a cinch and before long you will be creating your own team or joining another. Then it is time for some planetside monster-bashing. As you cannot harm your team mates, co-operation is all and combat strategy is essential for success. Thankfully communication is easy, with instant translation into five languages, and standard icons used to create an unrivalled team atmosphere. In fact, the communication element is perhaps the biggest achievement of PSO, taking the relatively simple hack'n'slash gameplay to a new level. Sumptuous graphics are the icing on the cake and the only downside to Phantasy Star Online is cost. With the average session lasting more than an hour, you can expect heavy phone bills. In this rare case, they are worth it. (GH) Three Kingdoms: Fate of the Dragon PC CD-Rom \u00a329.99 Overmax/Eidos Interactive *** After Civilization, Age of Empires, and the legion of inferior imitators, the historical real-time strategy game seemed a used-up genre. Three Kingdoms is not about to change that. Sure, the setting is rich and colourful. The game takes us back to second century China, where three warlords are engaged in a fierce battle for control of the fragmented empire. Using an isometric view, you can play as any of the three, each of whom has unique forces at his disposal. You know the shtick. In order to build up those forces, you must first develop your home city by chopping wood, mining, building farms, and training peasants. Yay. Resource management. Has no one yet told games designers that resource management is the opposite of fun? Some of us have enough trouble remembering to buy milk, for goodness sake. Anyway, once the city is up and running, things get slightly more enjoyable as you send out your troops, occupy county towns, besiege enemy cities and invent new technologies. You know. The usual. (One tiny difference here is that you must remember to keep your troops supplied with food or they will weaken and become useless in battle. Personally, I would rather spend a little longer training the soldiers until they were intelligent enough to forage for themselves.) Military might is not the only route to victory, however. You can also win by making more scientific progress than your rivals, or by skilful use of trade and diplomacy. Hey, there has to be somebody out there who wants to try that. Graphically speaking, it is pretty and the soundtrack is marginally preferable to having a plate scraped in your ear. I know, I know, I have just described every historical RTS you have ever seen. But then, that is what this is. A dead horse being flogged, albeit in a competent and moderately entertaining way. (AB) Globetrotter PC \u00a329.99 Vsion Park/EA * In many ways there's something charming about Globetrotter, in that it harks back to days when games were a cottage industry and A-list titles frequently arrived with photocopied instructions and labels stuck to cassettes by the programmer's mum. Globetrotter turned up looking decidedly low-budget and boasting the most useless insert ever seen - a poorly drawn departure schedule. Not a promising start. But wait. Having installed it, up popped a very professional video montage of people travelling to exotic locations, easily up to Lonely Planet titles and accompanied by some funky original music. Perhaps I have judged this too early? Nah - it's rubbish. Video over, the game kicks in with hilarious results. Imagine Pokemon Snap without the 3D engine, with gigantic characters strutting across unconvincing, out-of-scale maps. Every level involves much the same thing: you have to go to a location and take photos of it, returning to base or travelling elsewhere within a set time limit. Some places can be walked to (simply point on the map and click); others need train, plane or boat connections. Along the way, you may be asked one of 4,000 simple trivia questions loosely based on local history. For instance, in London we are asked what performance led to the rise of the Beatles. Yes, it is the Ed Sullivan show - and that's London summed up, don't you think? In fairness, there is the potential here for quite an interesting game, perhaps using a Sim City-style engine. But alas there are far too many problems to be cured by a simple makeover. As a game, Globetrotter's credentials are uncertain; as a travel aid it is one stage below chronically inept. For example, although major bridges are pointed out on the map, characters can still wade through rivers leaving tell-tale splashes in their wake. Somehow, being able to choose their sex (it makes no difference to the gameplay, of course) fails to make up for so many laws of physics, geography and common sense being broken all at once. All in all, Globetrotter looks and plays like a school project and cannot be recommended even to lovers of kitsch (which it so nearly is). Whoever Vision Park is, this merely adds weight to the claim that developing videogames is a big boy's game these days. (MA)",

Due next month, the IDC-1000Z uses Sanyo's new 730MB ID Photo Magneto optical disc system to house up 11,000 stills or two hours of video files. It can also be used to archive up to 24 hours of voice dictation. Another key facility is the camera's Sequential Shot Function, which can take up to 30 shots in one second. The IDC-1000Z, which has a resolution of 1.5 megapixels, is due to retail for around \u00a3700. Sanyo has also become the latest Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer to offer its take on the MP3 format with its just launched personal-sized player, the \u00a3250 SSP-PD7. In addition to playing MP3, the unit is also compatible with AAC (Advanced Acoustic Coding) files. If AAC is used, the player can store up to an hour of music on its removable 32MB MultiMedia card, whereas MP3 compression stores around half an hour. AAC download times are also twice as fast MP3 ones. The player comes with rechargeable batteries, which deliver around five hours of playback. Sanyo is also joining Philips, Bush and Goodmans in offering a personal CD player that will read MP3 files burned on to CD-ROMs. The CDP-M300, which also boasts a 45-second anti-shock system, goes on sale in July. No news on prices yet.</p> <p> <strong>Snap and sing </strong><br> Kodak has joined Samsung and Fuji in offering a digital camera with a built-in MP3 player. Scheduled for a March launch, the \u00a3200 MC3 is also one of the cheapest digital cameras to offer both video capture and an LCD screen. The camera comes with a 16MB CompactFlash card, which will store up to 110 digital images or 20 minutes of video, but a paltry 15 minutes of standard-quality MP3 music. Larger-capacity CompactFlash cards are available, although adding a 64MB card, which archives more than an hour of music, ramps up the cost by a further \u00a3140. The camera's other audio facilities include a built-in speaker, a headphones socket and an output for connection to a home or car stereo. Snappers are offered a self-timer, auto white balance and exposure and an image resolution of 640 by 480 pixels. (AN)</p> <p> <strong>Boxing clever</strong><br> Yorkshire-based Pace Micro Technology has unveiled a television set-top box that incorporates a Sega Dreamcast games console. The system includes a 40 gigabyte hard drive to store up to 60 games, which can be downloaded and updated via a cable or modem or data broadcasting connection. The drive can also be used to record TV programmes, like TiVo's digital VCR, and in the next five to 10 years, Pace thinks it could develop into a \"home gateway\" to connect up other devices. Andrew Wallace,Pace's marketing director, says: \"Fundamentally, what we are offering is cost-effective access to a new market of casual gamers. We don't expect keen gamers to buy this product.\"</p> <p> In fact, neither type of gamer will be able to buy the product. Pace is offering the system to cable and satellite TV operators, who will charge their subscribers a higher monthly fee - perhaps $20 - to rent the system. The deal is non-exclusive on both sides. Pace remains free to integrate rival games systems in similar set-top boxes, while Sega is talking to other device manufacturers about using its games technology. (JS)</p>",

The camera comes with a 16MB CompactFlash card, which will store up to 110 digital images or 20 minutes of video, but a paltry 15 minutes of standard-quality MP3 music. Larger-capacity CompactFlash cards are available, although adding a 64MB card, which archives more than an hour of music, ramps up the cost by a further \u00a3140. The camera's other audio facilities include a built-in speaker, a headphones socket and an output for connection to a home or car stereo. Snappers are offered a self-timer, auto white balance and exposure and an image resolution of 640 by 480 pixels. (AN) Boxing clever Yorkshire-based Pace Micro Technology has unveiled a television set-top box that incorporates a Sega Dreamcast games console. The system includes a 40 gigabyte hard drive to store up to 60 games, which can be downloaded and updated via a cable or modem or data broadcasting connection. The drive can also be used to record TV programmes, like TiVo's digital VCR, and in the next five to 10 years, Pace thinks it could develop into a \"home gateway\" to connect up other devices. Andrew Wallace,Pace's marketing director, says: \"Fundamentally, what we are offering is cost-effective access to a new market of casual gamers. We don't expect keen gamers to buy this product.\" In fact, neither type of gamer will be able to buy the product. Pace is offering the system to cable and satellite TV operators, who will charge their subscribers a higher monthly fee - perhaps $20 - to rent the system. The deal is non-exclusive on both sides. Pace remains free to integrate rival games systems in similar set-top boxes, while Sega is talking to other device manufacturers about using its games technology. (JS)",

      "body": "<p>Spirited, engaging Lord (John) Mackay of Ardbrecknish, who has died suddenly at 62, was formerly the Tory MP for Argyll and then for Argyll and Bute, before being \"kicked upstairs\" in 1991 after his 1987 defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats. Having been a junior Scottish minister in the Commons from 1982-87, he became a minister of state for social security in the Lords under John Major from 1994-97.</p> <p>When William Hague purged Lord Cranborne and his cohorts in December 1998 for their secret deal with Tony Blair, he made Lord Mackay deputy leader of the Conservative opposition in the Lords. As such, he made some of their best speeches, claiming for the Tories the role of the effective reforming party. He gave up this post last November, nominally to become chairman of the committees of the Lords, the most senior member of the House after the Lord Chancellor.</p> <p>Widely popular, he did not seem to fit wholly in with the new, increasingly rightwing and Europhobic regime. Only last week he took a major job outside the House. A man of modest means, he required extra employment when deprived of ministerial pay. When he lost Argyll and Bute, he became chief executive of the Scottish Conservatives from 1987-90.</p> <p>Irreverent, he even dared make fun of the hereditary backwoodsmen who came out of the woodwork to make up Tory majorities in the Lords. In November 1998 he said: \"There are some people here I have never seen before and (was) wondering who they were.\" According to Viscount Thurso, his witty debating style was \"rather like a well executed Scottish reel. There is lots of style, much movement, lots of euching and at the end you find that you are back where you started!\"</p> <p>Mackay was the son of a policeman.

      "bodyText": "Spirited, engaging Lord (John) Mackay of Ardbrecknish, who has died suddenly at 62, was formerly the Tory MP for Argyll and then for Argyll and Bute, before being \"kicked upstairs\" in 1991 after his 1987 defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats. Having been a junior Scottish minister in the Commons from 1982-87, he became a minister of state for social security in the Lords under John Major from 1994-97. When William Hague purged Lord Cranborne and his cohorts in December 1998 for their secret deal with Tony Blair, he made Lord Mackay deputy leader of the Conservative opposition in the Lords. As such, he made some of their best speeches, claiming for the Tories the role of the effective reforming party. He gave up this post last November, nominally to become chairman of the committees of the Lords, the most senior member of the House after the Lord Chancellor. Widely popular, he did not seem to fit wholly in with the new, increasingly rightwing and Europhobic regime. Only last week he took a major job outside the House. A man of modest means, he required extra employment when deprived of ministerial pay. When he lost Argyll and Bute, he became chief executive of the Scottish Conservatives from 1987-90. Irreverent, he even dared make fun of the hereditary backwoodsmen who came out of the woodwork to make up Tory majorities in the Lords. In November 1998 he said: \"There are some people here I have never seen before and (was) wondering who they were.\" According to Viscount Thurso, his witty debating style was \"rather like a well executed Scottish reel. There is lots of style, much movement, lots of euching and at the end you find that you are back where you started!\" Mackay was the son of a policeman. He was educated at Dunoon grammar school, as were Labour ministers George Robertson and Brian Wilson, and the late Labour leader John Smith, and at Campbeltown in Argyll. After Glasgow University, where he started a lifelong friendship with the late Donald Dewar, he became head of the maths department at Oban high school. After a brief flirtation with the Liberals in his early years, he sought a Westminster seat for the Tories when he contested the Western Isles and then Argyll, in the two general elections of 1974. But it was not until five years later that he succeeded, becoming MP for Argyll in 1979 when he snatched the seat from the SNP. In the 1980s he had a three-year stint as chairman of the Sea Fish Industry Authority. He was a keen angler but was allergic to dogs, confessing in a debate: \"In close proximity with dogs, I become unwell.\" adding, \"cats are worse and rabbits worse still.\" He leaves his wife, Sheena, two sons and a daughter. \u0095 John Mackay, Baron Mackay of Ardbrecknish, politician, born November 15 1938; died February 21 2001.

      "body": "<p>Eminem may not have won the top prize of album of the year at the Grammy awards ceremony in Los Angeles but he still remained the focus of attention at the highly charged event because of protests against his violent and homophobic lyrics. </p> <p>He performed a much-anticipated duet with gay rights campaigner Elton John and the two embraced and raised their arms together on stage, an event described by a protester on the street outside as \"like Barbra Streisand embracing Eva Braun.\" </p> <p>Eminem won Grammys for best rap album and best rap solo performance but was beaten for the top award by the grizzled veterans Steely Dan and their Two Against Nature. Bette Midler, who presented the award, said she had been so nervous about the controversy surrounding it and the possibility of angry protests that she had decided to come on stage with the most popular person in the business, Stevie Wonder. </p> <p>Just before the award was made, the president of the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, Michael Greene, made a plea to the packed Staples Centre and a wider television audience not to be too harsh in their judgment, saying \"It takes tolerance to teach tolerance.\" </p> <p>He likened protests against Eminem to earlier ones against Elvis Presley, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. \"The white teenagers from the suburbs buy a majority of the music in question,\" said Mr Greene, who has come under attack from gay and lesbian groups for not speaking out against the Eminem lyrics. </p> <p>\"They live out their rebellion and delineate their rite of passage through this music. Most of the adults who pass judgment have never listened to or, more to the point, never even engaged their kids about the object of their contempt... That is not to say there is not a lot to fear in this violence-drenched society of ours.\" </p> <p>Mr Greene said that \"musicians, movie stars and athletes are not perfect\" and could not always be relied on to be role models. </p> <p>Protesters outside in the street had earlier criticised Greene, Eminem and Elton John. One of the speakers at a small rally, lesbian comedian Robin Tyler, who made the Streisand/Braun remark, accused Eminem of writing \"neo-Nazi lyrics\". As the white stretch limos arrived with the night's guests, Gwenn Baldwin of the LA Gay and Lesbian Centre said: \"Find your edgy voice, Eminem, but don't carve it on the backs of gays and lesbians.\" </p> <p>Lynette Sperber of Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) said: \"Elton John has been such a brave and courageous warrior in our fight... I wonder if he remembers what it was like for him before he came out.\" </p> <p>Patricia Ireland of the National Organisation for Women said of Eminem winning Grammys: \"It sends a terrible message to young impressionable men that somehow it's OK to go out and bash gays and women and somehow get a thrill, and I don't see these impressionable young guys saying 'Oh, that's good satire'. There is nothing in this man's body of work that does anything except promote bigotry.\" </p> <p>A few Eminem supporters, including a group calling themselves Faggots 4 Eminem, counter-protested. Said one, Mike Watters from West Hollywood: \"censorship is a slippery slope.\" </p> <p>He said that he believed that many gay performers had not joined the protests because they did not believe in censorship.

      "bodyText": "Eminem may not have won the top prize of album of the year at the Grammy awards ceremony in Los Angeles but he still remained the focus of attention at the highly charged event because of protests against his violent and homophobic lyrics. He performed a much-anticipated duet with gay rights campaigner Elton John and the two embraced and raised their arms together on stage, an event described by a protester on the street outside as \"like Barbra Streisand embracing Eva Braun.\" Eminem won Grammys for best rap album and best rap solo performance but was beaten for the top award by the grizzled veterans Steely Dan and their Two Against Nature. Bette Midler, who presented the award, said she had been so nervous about the controversy surrounding it and the possibility of angry protests that she had decided to come on stage with the most popular person in the business, Stevie Wonder. Just before the award was made, the president of the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, Michael Greene, made a plea to the packed Staples Centre and a wider television audience not to be too harsh in their judgment, saying \"It takes tolerance to teach tolerance.\" He likened protests against Eminem to earlier ones against Elvis Presley, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. \"The white teenagers from the suburbs buy a majority of the music in question,\" said Mr Greene, who has come under attack from gay and lesbian groups for not speaking out against the Eminem lyrics. \"They live out their rebellion and delineate their rite of passage through this music. Most of the adults who pass judgment have never listened to or, more to the point, never even engaged their kids about the object of their contempt... That is not to say there is not a lot to fear in this violence-drenched society of ours.\" Mr Greene said that \"musicians, movie stars and athletes are not perfect\" and could not always be relied on to be role models. Protesters outside in the street had earlier criticised Greene, Eminem and Elton John. One of the speakers at a small rally, lesbian comedian Robin Tyler, who made the Streisand/Braun remark, accused Eminem of writing \"neo-Nazi lyrics\". As the white stretch limos arrived with the night's guests, Gwenn Baldwin of the LA Gay and Lesbian Centre said: \"Find your edgy voice, Eminem, but don't carve it on the backs of gays and lesbians.\" Lynette Sperber of Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) said: \"Elton John has been such a brave and courageous warrior in our fight... I wonder if he remembers what it was like for him before he came out.\" Patricia Ireland of the National Organisation for Women said of Eminem winning Grammys: \"It sends a terrible message to young impressionable men that somehow it's OK to go out and bash gays and women and somehow get a thrill, and I don't see these impressionable young guys saying 'Oh, that's good satire'. There is nothing in this man's body of work that does anything except promote bigotry.\" A few Eminem supporters, including a group calling themselves Faggots 4 Eminem, counter-protested. Said one, Mike Watters from West Hollywood: \"censorship is a slippery slope.\" He said that he believed that many gay performers had not joined the protests because they did not believe in censorship. There was also a small contingent of Napster supporters carrying placards in support of the beleaguered music-swapping service. Early in the proceedings Eminem was on his best behaviour as he won the rap album award and thanked those who had voted for him for \"seeing past the controversy and seeing the album for what it is and what it isn't\". He used the occasion to tell his young daughter \"Daddy loves you.\" U2, always a favourite with the Grammy audience, picked up awards for the Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for Beautiful Day.

      "body": "<p>This time last year, it was a safe bet that most online retailers launched on the internet were not having conversations about how to branch out on to the high street. </p> <p>For these \"internet pure plays\", the ability to blow away the traditional rules of business, cut out the middleman from the supply chain, and eradicate the need for an organisation built on bricks and mortar was central to their desire to capture a substantial share of the budding e-commerce market. </p> <p>Collectively, they exhibited an almost perverse aversion for all things rooted in the physical world, preferring to set up shop on the web and exclude the high street altogether. Extremely high market valuations handed out by the City coupled with bullish forecasts for internet penetration within UK households seemed to vindicate them every step of the way. This was the \"new economy\", after all. </p> <p>Fast-forward to the present day, marked by crashing dot.coms, minuscule advertising revenues, dangerously high cash burn rates and bargain basement shopping by high-street stalwarts looking to establish an online presence on the cheap. Pure play e-commerce companies will now try to sell to customers in any way they want to buy - online, over the phone, from a shopping centre or all of the above. Suddenly the customer - not content - is king again. </p> <p>A survey from marketing research company BMRB provides grist to that particular mill. According to its quarterly Internet Monitor report, the average amount spent per UK internet shopper dropped from \u00a3403 to \u00a3326, in the six months to November 2000, and total e-commerce spending fell to \u00a32.2 billion from \u00a32.5 billion in the preceding six-month period. Whether or not this is just a blip peculiar to a burgeoning market, it has been enough to make online retailers give more thought to offline sales. </p> <p>\"It's about a move from 'the web is everything' to 'convenience is everything',\" acknowledges Dominic Cameron, chief technology officer at Lastminute.com, one of many branching out from offering sales purely over the web. </p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\" target=\"_new\">Lastminute.com</a>, the move began last Christmas with the launch of its interactive voice recognition system (IVR), an automated dial-in service for people not necessarily at the other end of a PC to call in with their requests. Simultaneously, the e-retailer published a gift catalogue that circulated as an insert in a number of national newspapers over the period. This also carried the telephone number for the service, which allowed the customer to buy from the Lastminute.com database, by navigating through a number of pre-recorded questions. </p> <p>Cameron says the level of response surprised the company. \"Firstly, the average value of a shopping basket bought through the IVR service was distinctly higher than that bought over the web; and secondly, more items were bought per purchase this way than on the web. We also think that the vast majority of people who bought via IVR had either never visited or never bought from the site.\" </p> <p>However, Carl Lyons, head of UK marketing at Lastminute.com is reluctant to see the catalogue as separate from other offline marketing activities (such as advertising on the sides of buses) and will not be drawn on whether it will become a staple feature of the company. </p> <p>But there are plenty of others who now see the catalogue as integral to their sales strategy, as mail order fast becomes the complementary channel of choice for many e-commerce companies. </p> <p>Take <a href=\"http://www.ThinkNatural.com\" target=\"_new\">ThinkNatural</a>, the online natural health and beauty retailer, which bought the mail order business of the Women's Nutritional Advisory Service (WNAS), last December and launched into the German market a few weeks ago. In addition, it has forged a deal that takes its products right to the heart of the high street, by engaging investor Kingfisher's Superdrug chemist chains to stock ThinkNatural-branded products. \"We've always seen the high street as a very powerful tool. Walking past a brand in the high street every day delivers a powerful message,\" says ThinkNatural co-founder Emma Crowe. </p> <p>The retailer is about to print its third catalogue to date with a 120,000 print run, according to Crowe. \"Some of our customers have no internet access at home and so would want the catalogue instead. So it has increased our customer base and has been another opportunity to promote our brand.\" </p> <p> Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.Confetti.co.uk\" taarget=\"_new\">Confetti.co.uk</a>, the wedding products website, is offering an \"upmarket\" catalogue in a bid to enter the lucrative wedding list market, and will use a warehouse acquired last year from home shopping business Findel to stock and ship the goods. </p> <p>&lt; a href=\"http://www.Madaboutwine.com\"target=_new&gt;Madaboutwine.com, the online wine merchant, has also acquired direct mail outfits World Wines Direct and Waverley Direct since it was launched two years ago. </p> <p>Mike Honor, an analyst at Forrester Research, declares this strategy a \"no brainer\" because it can exploit assets already held by e-commerce businesses, such as the same back-end computer systems, warehouses and call centres. \"It can even be seen as a viable exit strategy. If things don't work out on the internet, moving into mail order would be relatively easy,\" he adds. </p> <p>The high street is also proving fertile ground for failed dot.coms to begin again, away from their pure play origins. ThinkNatural's rival, Clickmango, closed down last September, five months after launch. Since then, US-based Red Beach bought the brand, and plans to re-launch it on the high street in the next few months with fellow investor, Adcore. Having learned lessons and borrowed an idea from ThinkNatural, it is now looking to sign a deal with \"a major high street chain\" to feature the Clickmango brand in its stores. </p> <p>But the boldest offline move so far has to be the effort by Gameplay. Last November, the online and mail order games retailer launched eight high street shops, after it acquired Dixons' chain of @jakarta games outlets in exchange for a 12.5% stake in Gameplay. </p> <p>However, going into direct competition with Virgin Megastore, HMV and Electronics Boutique on their own turf turned out to be a flawed move. Barely three months after opening its shops, Gameplay announced plans to shut them down, in a bid to shelve \"non-core\" activities. </p> <p>\"To actually move wholesale from the internet into the high street is expensive and difficult.

      "body": "<p>Pat Davis presides over one of Bristol's largest retail businesses. A sharply turned out executive with an alphabet soup of letters after her name, she has 27 shops under her management in the city, and oversees the financial arrangements for 220 paid staff and more than 700 volunteers, juggling investments and an annual turnover worth millions. </p> <p>She works from an office in central Bristol, but we meet in her business's premises in the north of the city, an impressive modern building with beautiful, landscaped gardens, dotted with rose bowers, benches and water features. It is a lovely place to work. It is an even more enviable environment in which to die. </p> <p>Those lucky enough not to have required the services of a hospice are likely to be surprised by St Peter's hospice, for which Ms Davis works as fundraising director. Nowhere to be seen are the cracked pipes and grubby paintwork of too many NHS wards. The decor is light and breezy; cheerful nurses sweep along corridors decked in fresh flowers. It feels calm, quiet, restful. </p> <p>But this is not the hushed, stifling quiet of imminent death. The corridors are silent because almost half of the beds are empty. Demand for a place is unrelenting, says Ms Davis, but the hospice can't afford to staff them. Despite the 27 charity shops dedicated to raising funds for the hospice, she can't find the cash to care for any more than 10 in-patients at a time. </p> <p>Most of us, doubtless, prefer not to think of it, but St Peter's is just the place where we would like to imagine ourselves dying: local, pleasant, lavishly staffed by NHS standards, and with a level of specialisation in pain management that is often missing in state-provided health care. The beauty of the place, says Chris Salt, 73, one of the patients, is in the detail: \"Every tray comes with a vase of flowers, it makes such a difference.\" </p> <p>Reflexology and aromatherapy are as much part of the care as that of the specialist palliative nurses who work there. Rooms are often ensuite, and the baths are fitted with jacuzzis. \"If you weren't sick,\" said Ms Salt, \"you would think you were in a five-star hotel\". </p> <p>They have even taken care in the decor, says Hazel Elliott, the nursing director, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"I told them we weren't to have any of the bedrooms painted green or yellow. If you are a bit jaundiced, the last thing you want is your skin being reflected in the walls.\" </p> <p>We may hope to end our days somewhere so humane, but the question is whether, after we have used up the remainder of our allotted four-score-and-whatever, there will be any hospices left. Of the 230 hospices dotted around the UK, a few are NHS-run, others are managed by specialist charities such as Marie Curie Cancer Care, but the vast majority (185) are independent, voluntary set-ups like St Peter's. They are local charities, locally managed - and almost entirely locally funded. And that, says Ms Davis, is the problem. </p> <p>The sector's umbrella group, Help the Hospices, has just issued a bleak warning that more than half the hospices in the UK are in financial trouble. Beds are closing, nurses are being laid off, others are dipping into investments and reserves that are just about keeping the bailiffs at bay, but will not last for ever. </p> <p>The St Peter's site in north Bristol was built three years ago to expand the services offered at another site; in total, it has 20 beds open in the city. But, says Ms Davis, the organisation's funding from the NHS has gone up \"hardly at all\", despite the fact that service provision has doubled. </p> <p>As well as the in-patients, up to 120 patients attend St Peter's' two sites weekly through day sessions, where they can have their hair done, consult a doctor, or chat with other patients. The hospice also employs nurses who work in the community, helping patients in their homes and providing specialist training to GPs and district nurses. Within the space of a year, 1,200 patients come into direct contact with its services. </p> <p>\"Everybody is working flat out to keep the service at the level we currently have,\" said Ms Davis. \"If we had more money there are other things we would like to do, but we are running to stand still. This year we start with a \u00a3200,000 shortfall. You obviously can't do that for long before you go bankrupt.\" </p> <p>Hospice care has never formed part of core NHS provision. While homes for the dying were run by religious groups from the 19th century, the modern hospice movement can trace its origins to the late 1960s, when a small number of hospices were established. A decision was taken at that point to run them as voluntary charities, in order, said David Praill, chief executive of Help the Hospices, to ensure that the service remained of a higher quality than the statutory minimum inevitably provided by the state. </p> <p>But they were also to remain free and open to anyone.

      "bodyText": "Pat Davis presides over one of Bristol's largest retail businesses. A sharply turned out executive with an alphabet soup of letters after her name, she has 27 shops under her management in the city, and oversees the financial arrangements for 220 paid staff and more than 700 volunteers, juggling investments and an annual turnover worth millions. She works from an office in central Bristol, but we meet in her business's premises in the north of the city, an impressive modern building with beautiful, landscaped gardens, dotted with rose bowers, benches and water features. It is a lovely place to work. It is an even more enviable environment in which to die. Those lucky enough not to have required the services of a hospice are likely to be surprised by St Peter's hospice, for which Ms Davis works as fundraising director. Nowhere to be seen are the cracked pipes and grubby paintwork of too many NHS wards. The decor is light and breezy; cheerful nurses sweep along corridors decked in fresh flowers. It feels calm, quiet, restful. But this is not the hushed, stifling quiet of imminent death. The corridors are silent because almost half of the beds are empty. Demand for a place is unrelenting, says Ms Davis, but the hospice can't afford to staff them. Despite the 27 charity shops dedicated to raising funds for the hospice, she can't find the cash to care for any more than 10 in-patients at a time. Most of us, doubtless, prefer not to think of it, but St Peter's is just the place where we would like to imagine ourselves dying: local, pleasant, lavishly staffed by NHS standards, and with a level of specialisation in pain management that is often missing in state-provided health care. The beauty of the place, says Chris Salt, 73, one of the patients, is in the detail: \"Every tray comes with a vase of flowers, it makes such a difference.\" Reflexology and aromatherapy are as much part of the care as that of the specialist palliative nurses who work there. Rooms are often ensuite, and the baths are fitted with jacuzzis. \"If you weren't sick,\" said Ms Salt, \"you would think you were in a five-star hotel\". They have even taken care in the decor, says Hazel Elliott, the nursing director, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"I told them we weren't to have any of the bedrooms painted green or yellow. If you are a bit jaundiced, the last thing you want is your skin being reflected in the walls.\" We may hope to end our days somewhere so humane, but the question is whether, after we have used up the remainder of our allotted four-score-and-whatever, there will be any hospices left. Of the 230 hospices dotted around the UK, a few are NHS-run, others are managed by specialist charities such as Marie Curie Cancer Care, but the vast majority (185) are independent, voluntary set-ups like St Peter's. They are local charities, locally managed - and almost entirely locally funded. And that, says Ms Davis, is the problem. The sector's umbrella group, Help the Hospices, has just issued a bleak warning that more than half the hospices in the UK are in financial trouble. Beds are closing, nurses are being laid off, others are dipping into investments and reserves that are just about keeping the bailiffs at bay, but will not last for ever. The St Peter's site in north Bristol was built three years ago to expand the services offered at another site; in total, it has 20 beds open in the city. But, says Ms Davis, the organisation's funding from the NHS has gone up \"hardly at all\", despite the fact that service provision has doubled. As well as the in-patients, up to 120 patients attend St Peter's' two sites weekly through day sessions, where they can have their hair done, consult a doctor, or chat with other patients. The hospice also employs nurses who work in the community, helping patients in their homes and providing specialist training to GPs and district nurses. Within the space of a year, 1,200 patients come into direct contact with its services. \"Everybody is working flat out to keep the service at the level we currently have,\" said Ms Davis. \"If we had more money there are other things we would like to do, but we are running to stand still. This year we start with a \u00a3200,000 shortfall. You obviously can't do that for long before you go bankrupt.\" Hospice care has never formed part of core NHS provision. While homes for the dying were run by religious groups from the 19th century, the modern hospice movement can trace its origins to the late 1960s, when a small number of hospices were established. A decision was taken at that point to run them as voluntary charities, in order, said David Praill, chief executive of Help the Hospices, to ensure that the service remained of a higher quality than the statutory minimum inevitably provided by the state. But they were also to remain free and open to anyone. Which meant an enormous commitment to fundraising. And an unrelenting round of tombolas, teddy bear raffles, and local paper photographs of smiling nurses clutching outsized cheques. As other groups established their own hospices, funds from the NHS remained unforthcoming. But as the population has aged and palliative medicine - offered to those for whom a cure is no longer a possibility, but who need help managing pain - has become more sophisticated, governments have recognised that they have a moral responsibility to care for the dying. Many hospices got their first grant from their health authority in the early 1990s; this now averages just 30% of running costs nationally. At St Peter's, the figure is 20%. And falling. \"We have to match pay awards in the NHS,\" said Ms Elliott, \"or we would never be able to recruit any nurses.\" Avon health authority, however, has told St Peter's it will get only an inflationary rise for next year. They hope not to close more beds. But they can't go on for ever. The obvious solution is to remove the en suites, cut out the cut flowers, trim the nursing ratio (often at more than one nurse for two patients) and slash other non-essential services. It's a prospect Mr Praill considers with despair. \"There is an intimacy around issues of dying that does not sit easily with the environment of a busy NHS ward,\" he said, \"and we can't begin to resemble that. There is something about end of life care that is different from having a broken leg or getting your tonsils out.\" In September, the government announced an extra \u00a350m for palliative care - very welcome, all say, but it remains to be seen whether any of this money will filter down to funding those services under threat. Ms Salt is packed up and ready to go home today, \"feeling much better\" after her short stay at St Peter's.

      "body": "<p>\"And this year's Oscar for best actress goes to ... a single mother.\" This may sound an unlikely prospect, but when the winners of the 73rd annual Academy Awards are announced next month, the odds are in its favour. Of the five women nominated in the best actress category, three are being recognised for their portrayal of single parents, another for her role as a widow struggling with her heroin addict son. Only Joan Allen, nominated for her role as a vice presidential candidate in The Contender, stops lone parents sweeping the board. Meanwhile, Frances McDormand is nominated as best supporting actress for her role as a widowed mother of a precocious teenager in Almost Famous. </p> <p>According to recent estimates, one in four children in the UK will spend some time in a lone parent family. It is hardly surprising Hollywood has spotted that contemporary families are no longer entirely nuclear. But what do real single mothers think of their on-screen sisters? </p> <p>\"It seems like Hollywood's always going through phases,\" says Fiona Brophy, 27, a lone parent from south London, whose daughter Niamh is nearly three. \"I'd say this is being done for commercial reasons - a lot of women go to the cinema and many are probably single parents. It's just Hollywood's way of making money.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Brophy is encouraged by the apparent acceptance of single mothers on screen. \"It's good to bring the issue into people's minds. There is a stigma attached to single mothers and often we're portrayed negatively.\" </p> <p>Not all the relevant films have been seen yet in the UK. Odds-on favourite is Julia Roberts for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich, a real-life single mother who uncovered a business pollution scandal while working as a legal secretary. Ellen Burstyn plays the widowed mother of a junkie in Requiem For A Dream, while Juliette Binoche is a chocolate-maker who stirs local passions when she opens a patisserie in a conservative French town, in Chocolat, opening tomorrow. Laura Linney's performance in You Can Count On Me, as a single mother trying to balance responsibilities to her son and wayward brother, can be seen in late March. </p> <p>\"This isn't a fad, it's a trend that reflects reality,\" says Jeff Sharp, one of the producers of You Can Count On Me. \"There are increasing numbers of strong, successful women who are raising families and having a career without a partner, as my own mother did. This film shows the reality of what families are like nowadays.\" </p> <p>Nor are cinematic single mothers restricted to the Oscar nominees: think of Gwyneth Paltrow in Bounce and Helen Hunt in Pay It Forward. Their portrayals of forceful, determined women are quite different from the self-sacrificing heroines depicted in black and white weepies such as Mildred Pierce and Stella Dallas. </p> <p>\"These women aren't victims,\" Sharp says. \"Hollywood has realised women should be given stronger, more central roles.\" </p> <p>\"Hollywood has portrayed single mothers as prominent characters since the era of silent film,\" says Lisa Barry, a gender and film scholar at Albion College in Michigan, who specialises in the cinematic depiction of single mothers. \"But for almost as long as they have been portrayed, they have been characterised as socially deviant or at least responsible for their kids' troubles. In these recent films, the women who portray the characters are strong, courageous and willing to take risks.\" </p> <p>Annie Oliver, 32, who works at the Single Parent Action Network in Bristol and is mother of 10-year-old Alex, agrees. \"I found aspects of Erin Brockovich very pleasing,\" she says. \"Lots of films portray single mothers as not coping or desperate to get back with their husbands. In this film, Julia Roberts was strong and independent. That's what single mothers have to be like. We have to be incredibly resourceful and learn to push like hell if we want something. We're not victims.\" </p> <p>Over the past few years, Oliver says she has noticed a change in the way single mothers are portrayed on screen. \"It's obviously become a way to show strong women. That's fine, as long as it's not just flavour of the month. That would be insulting.\" </p> <p>So has single motherhood simply become cinematic shorthand for a particular set of female characteristics? Having some of the industry's top names play lone parents certainly gives recognition to single mothers as well as garnering credibility for the actors. \"Playing a single mother calls on them to learn about a role that is somewhat perilous,\" Barry says. \"But it's typical that they are rarely single mothers themselves. If they were, their portrayals would probably be very different - more passionate, more critical, more real. There would be more of an edge, because single mothers suffer sneers and judgments all the time. The actresses aren't aware of this, so their characters are often very noble, very man-centred and very vulnerable.\" </p> <p>Many films appear to feel obliged to show the single mother looking for a permanent relationship, as if, as in Jerry Maguire, she is not complete without a man. In Sleepless In Seattle, the son of widower Tom Hanks decides his father needs a woman and sets about finding him one. Naturally the film ends with Hanks and his intended, Meg Ryan, looking to the future together. </p> <p>\"Being a single parent is often seen as a stepping stone to a permanent relationship,\" Brophy says. \"But lots of us are happy to remain as we are. I'm not anti-men, but I'm perfectly happy and I don't want to get married. Films should reflect that, too.\" </p> <p>As in reality, these films also seem to throw up a pecking order within lone motherhood. Gwyneth Paltrow as a widow, for example, is most acceptable. Julia Roberts and Laura Linney depict divorcees; Helen Hunt has been left by a violent alcoholic. Their movie fates vary accordingly. Paltrow winds up with a new romance; Hunt's little boy is stabbed to death in a playground fight. </p> <p>\"There is a huge hierarchy within single motherhood,\" Brophy says. \"It's far more acceptable if you've gone through divorce or been widowed because at least you've had children in wedlock and conformed to social norms. You get more sympathy if you've been widowed because it's not your fault. There's a sliding scale and single mothers who choose to be single mothers are the lowest of the low. Niamh came about because of a holiday romance and that's even worse.\" </p> <p>Victoria Green, 28, who had her daughter Milly when she was 17, says her own experiences make her keen to see different kinds of lone parenting situations portrayed. \"I'd like to see more positive images of absent fathers,\" Green says. \"I had a relationship with my daughter's father when we were teenagers and it didn't last, but he's always been very supportive. It would be good to show that parents who have separated don't have to be fighting all the time.\" </p> <p>\"I'm glad single parents are being recognised,\" Oliver says. \"But people have to realise that, while there's the odd person like Erin Brockovich around, most single mothers work as hard and are as determined, but don't end up with millions. It's a bit like Pretty Woman. Don't go out and be a prostitute just because Julia Roberts ended up with a rich man.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>For a man with his culinary tastes, you\u2019d expect the most terrifying feature of Dr Hannibal Lecter to be his teeth. But on the poster for Ridley Scott\u2019s Hannibal, they are discreetly sheathed behind Anthony Hopkins\u2019s benign smile. What arrests you instead is his eye - just the one - deep crimson, gleaming out at you with malevolent scrutiny. Part of Dr Lecter\u2019s power, as we know, is his perspicacity as a psychologist - his ability to see into his victims\u2019 souls and suck out their spiritual marrow.</p> <p>But what the poster shows is not simply the gaze of the vampire - that ghoulish red is suggestive less of blood than of the chianti that the doctor is notoriously partial to. This is the eye of the killer as epicure.</p> <p>Cinema\u2019s history is full of eyes looking out at us from the screen, when we might expect to be the only ones looking. The returned gaze is hardly a novelty of cinema: in painting, there is a long history of ambivalent stares freezing viewers in their tracks. But what distinguishes the eye in cinema from the eye in painting is that a mechanical eye, the camera itself, is added to the equation, standing between viewer and object. And whenever a film reminds us of the eye, it invariably reminds us of the camera itself - reminds us, too, that while our own stare may sometimes be equivalent to the camera\u2019s, it is always dependent on it.</p> <p>The viewer\u2019s eye can easily be displaced, dominated, or even supplanted by the machine that is supposedly its obedient surrogate. The 1929 Soviet documentary essay Man With a Movie Camera features the image of a human eye superimposed on the centre of a camera lens, as if biology had been absorbed into the machine. Its director Dziga Vertov coined the term \u201ccine-eye\u201d (kino-glaz) to convey this sense of the camera as a new organ allowing film-maker and viewer a vital unimpeded access to the world: as if film-making could become an instinctive physical activity.</p> <p>In subjective shots, the camera literally stands for the eye, for what a specific character sees. We are most used to experiencing the subjective camera in brief snatches, often seeing through the eyes of characters we might normally prefer not to identify with, such as the killer in Halloween.</p> <p>But in Robert Montgomery\u2019s 1947 Chandler adaptation The Lady in the Lake, we see the entire film from detective Philip Marlow\u2019s point of view. This equivalence was stretched to a parodic degree in Powell and Pressburger\u2019s A Matter of Life and Death, in which we see not only through the eye of a patient in surgery, but through the thin flesh of his eyelids too.</p> <p>As ever-lighter film and video cameras let us take the immediacy of film-making increasingly for granted, films have tried to problematise the naive equivalence of camera and eye. Science-fiction writer William Gibson has imagined a future in which film stars have lenses transplanted into their eyes so that they become both actors and film-makers, recording their own experiences.</p> <p>Here they becomes a mere vehicle for the camera, and the camera becomes an apparatus of surveillance and control, the electronic eye replacing the human eye altogether: in Pedro Almodovar\u2019s Kika, a reality-show presenter (Victoria Abril) literally becomes a \u201croving eye\u201d, her camera implanted into her rubber headgear. She is the hi-tech granddaughter of Fritz Lang\u2019s monster of surveillance in The Thousand Eyes of Dr Mabuse (1960), where the eyes were TV screens monitoring hotel rooms.</p> <p>A more humanistic view sees the eye as a transcendental organ - the gateway to inner or outer space, even a portal to infinity. Saul Bass\u2019s opening credits to Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo convey the film\u2019s psychological complexity, as strange abstract whirls - mathematical forms known as Lissajous figures - spiral out of Kim Novak\u2019s eye.</p> <p>A more metaphysical version of this trope is the bravado opening sequence of Robert Zemeckis\u2019s science-fiction film Contact. We zoom slowly out through space, as the earth recedes into the distance, through comet storms, constellations and vast gaseous nebulae, and finally out through the eye of a young girl (who grows up to be the Jodie Foster character). By the end of the film, we realise that the outer space explored by the cosmonaut heroine is really the inner space of her own transcendentally inclined imagination.</p> <p>If the eye can be an object of scrutiny in itself, it\u2019s a short conceptual jump to the sense of the eye becoming disembodied, disturbingly autonomous from the human form that usually houses it. In Georges Franju\u2019s 1959 film Eyes Without a Face (Les Yeux Sans Visage), a plastic surgeon removes his victims\u2019 faces. The film, in other words, is not so much about eyes as about what happens when eyes and faces no longer form a single unity.</p> <p>The surgeon\u2019s disfigured daughter (Edith Scob) hides behind a featureless, but oddly beautiful alabaster mask, through which her recognisably human eyes gaze out enigmatically and poignantly. But the eyes of the title are also those of her father (Pierre Brasseur), gleaming malevolently through his own surgeon\u2019s mask - eyes and face separated, dehumanising the human form.</p> <p>We are routinely arrested by eyes that seem to leap out of the face they sit in, either because of their intensity, or because they are artificially enhanced: the bloodshot glare of Christopher Lee\u2019s Dracula, say, or the bizarre contact lenses (dollars, snake-like slits) worn by Charles Dance\u2019s villain in Last Action Hero. Even more alarming is the face without eyes - the unnerving transparency within Kevin Bacon\u2019s latex eyeholes in Paul Verhoeven\u2019s invisibility fantasy Hollow Man, or the eyeless metallic smoothness of the rampaging penile-headed predator in Alien.</p> <p>In all these cases, the eye has an element of abstraction - it appears, or fails to appear, as a window to the soul, offering access to inner feelings and intentions. But a disturbing, recurrent theme of cinema is the reminder that an eye is also a fleshy object, an organ that can be attacked, damaged and in extreme cases, detached from the body altogether. Perhaps cinema\u2019s most enduring image of nightmare violence is the opening of Bunuel and Dali\u2019s 1929 Un Chien Andalou: a man casually takes a cut-throat razor, holds open a woman\u2019s eye and slices it, so that it appears to exude a milky fluid.</p> <p>Perversely, we as viewers feel that we are the ones truly violated: the surrealistic reversal here is that the victim, in a bizarre state of acquiescent coolness, never flinches - but we do. As critic Linda Ruth Williams has put it, violence against the eye is \u201ca spectacular last straw of horror\u201d, the eye being \u201cgrotesquely penetrable, soft, liable to cry, bleed, respond with discharge, exquisitely sensitive to light and touch.\u201d No wonder eyes continue to be victimised: pecked out (The Birds), gouged by demons (The Saragossa Manuscript), sucked out of the skull (Total Recall), sliced (Lucio Fulci\u2019s notorious slasher movie The New York Ripper), surrounded with fringes of pins (Dario Argento\u2019s Opera, as well as the forthcoming Japanese chiller Audition).</p> <p>Few such acts have felt as painfully real as the clamping-open of anti-hero Alex\u2019s eyes in A Clockwork Orange, to force him to watch atrocities projected on a screen. The intensity of the sequence comes not only from the fact that we are in a similar position ourselves as we watch Kubrick\u2019s film, but that actor Malcolm McDowell endured considerable pain during the making of the film.</p> <p>The more the eye is treated as an object, the more it tends to become a ghoulish comic prop - like the gelatinous, artificially grown eyes waggled temptingly by a market trader in Blade Runner. One of the most grisly subjective shots in the horror genre puts us in the position of a flying eyeball as it hurtles directly into an onlooker\u2019s mouth in Evil Dead II.</p> <p>Glass eyes are a favourite for black comic effect: most scabrously in Bed Scenes, a short by French director Fran\u00e7ois Ozon. A young soldier asks a prostitute to sample her speciality: a blow job during which she sings the Marseillaise. It is only when the sequence ends that her eye resting on the bedside table tips us off as to how she did it.</p> <p>British-based animators The Brothers Quay and their Czech mentor Jan \u0160vankmajer have among them made a fetish of the artificial eye, human- or doll-size. In their films, the eye becomes a thing possessed of its own free-ranging will, and liable to appear where it wants to - in a doll\u2019s head, or generating new life forms in juxtaposition with a piece of liver. In \u0160vankmajer\u2019s latest film Otesanek, a chunk of wood comes alive and grows a murderous set of human teeth - disturbing enough, but not nearly as much as the single glaring eyeball that appears where the mouth should be.</p> <p>There is a less aggressive variant of this: the same sort of eyes pressed into smiling Plasticine heads, a trademark of the Aardman animation studio. In Chicken Run and the Wallace and Gromit films, the puppet eyeball is benign rather than sinister - yet it\u2019s a thin line. A current ad for Peperami sausage on the London tube shows a puppet eye peering out of the darkness from a strip of spicy meat.</p> <p>The ad is a clever parody of the Anthony Hopkins image: the caption reads, \u201cANIMAL\u201d. It is usually right next to the Hannibal poster, but I know which I find more disturbing. One eye is human and tinged only with chianti; the other may be glass, but it suggests blood, bone and offal. And unlike Dr Lecter at even his most implacable, the Peperami eye never blinks.</p>",

Menacing and militaris tic, models stalked the stage in shiny jodhpurs and long belted coats. A neckpiece of spikes and black pearls was worn with shiny leather trousers and a vest made from a swathe of coffee lace. A military cap was topped with an outsize feather headdress. As the first section of the show ended, a curtain went back to reveal a nightmarish toy cupboard: manic nodding dolls, giant teddy bears, and cobwebbed toy soldiers. From amongst them stepped a model wearing a ball dress of black and orange taffeta, her face obscured by balloons attached to her skirt ribbons. Keeping an eye on his investments from the front row was Domenico de Sole, chairman of the Gucci group that recently bought 51% of McQueen's company. McQueen had hit the only controversial note of the British fashion awards the previous evening when he criticised Britain for failing to invest in young designers. He challenged Nicholas Coleridge, chairman of the British Fashion Council to \"put his money where his mouth is ... I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Gucci.\" De Sole leapt to his feet at the end of the show and pumped McQueen's hand, grinning from ear to ear. It will not have escaped his notice that alongside the feathers and pearls and clown make-up there were highly sellable pieces, of the kind he is used to seeing on the Gucci catwalk: sleek tailored coats and pin-sharp trousersuits in cream and moss green, slinky silk jersey dresses with gently asymmetric seams.",

      "bodyText": "The NHS, local authorities and government departments should \"lead the way\" on race relations by ensuring more of their top jobs are filled by ethnic minority candidates, the government has urged. The call, by home secretary Jack Straw, came as he published a consultation document setting out a package of proposals to impose new race equality duties on public service bodies. Mr Straw said he was looking to the public sector - which has had a patchy record on race equality - to \"set the pace\" in the drive for race equality and to be a \"beacon for race relations\". Mr Straw said: \"Where it will have an impact is on those parts of the public service which are a bit behind in moving from talk to action. We don't think this will place a bureaucratic burden on public authorities. Many are already doing these things.\" The document outlines the government's plans for implementing the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000, which is aimed at tackling institutional racism in across the whole public sector. It says that ethnic minorities are under represented in the most senior parts of the public sector and this should be addressed \"as a top priority\". It adds: \"The government feels that it is unsatisfactory in a modern, pluralist society, with a long history of migration such as ours, that we have no ethnic minority generals or high court judges (and) that less than 2% of senior civil servants are from ethnic minorities.\" From April public services will have a \"positive legal duty\" to promote good race relations, while equality of opportunity will be imposed on every public body. They will have to monitor the ethnic composition of their workforce to ensure it reflects the minority ethnic make-up of their local community. Public bodies will have a duty to assess the impact on racial equality of proposed policies and new services. For example, if an NHS trust proposes to close, or open, a hospital it would have to publish an assessment of what impact it would have on local minority ethnic communities. The way councils or housing associations allocate homes, or the way schools operate their exclusion policies towards troublesome pupils, will also come under scrutiny. The act gives the Commission for Racial Equality powers to issue a compliance notices against organisations it believes are not fulfilling their duties in positively tackling race discrimination. The report says: \"The government believes that public authorities have a special responsibility as employers, policy makers and service providers to deliver race equality.\"",

      "bodyText": "The BBC plans to introduce changes to its staff payment processes, which could allow it to delay paying freelances in order to save money, according the National Union of Journalists. The NUJ has accused the BBC of planning to introduce a system it says will polarise freelance employees in a two-tier system. Freelance payments to staff are currently made on a self-billing basis, with payments going directly into staff's bank accounts at the end of the payment month. But under new plans, according to the NUJ, freelance production staff will have to invoice the BBC for payment, giving the BBC leave to wait up to 60 days before paying them. Meanwhile, \"talent\" - front-of-camera actors, sports stars and presenters - and other key production personnel will have clauses built in to their contracts to ensure they are paid monthly. Paul McLaughlin, the NUJ's broadcast organiser, said the union had written to the BBC advising it of the changes, which will go through at the next financial year in April. Because of the contract-based nature of much of the work in the BBC, the changes could affect up to 8,000 staff, according to Mr McLaughlin. He said the changes would be made across several departments. The NUJ has also written to broadcast union Bectu and the actor's union Equity to inform them of the changes. Mr McLaughlin said: \"Apparently the rationale is to withhold money from freelances for as long as possible to save money. \"This is akin to the kind of attitudes demonstrated by the more despicable ends of the media and broadcast organisations. \"We would be astonished if, in an effort to drive down costs, the BBC would be prepared to do this,\" he said. The BBC was not available to comment on the plans. Relevant story Feb 21: BBC staff to work to rule",

But a spokesman denied the move was driven by a desire to save money, as the National Union of Journalists has claimed. \"As part of the Apollo system, we are working on plans to move to a system that is more consistent,\" the spokesman told MediaGuardian.co.uk. \"In the past, freelance payments have been made at different times. \"We want to change it so everyone gets paid at the same time.\" He said the system would be phased in \"gradually, in order to avoid problems\". However, he was unable to guarantee all freelances would receive payment within a month of submitting their invoices. Yesterday, the NUJ claimed the BBC was introducing the changes to save money and argued up to 8,000 freelance workers could be out of pocket. The NUJ's objections follow a separate row over BBC expenses. NUJ members at the BBC are now on work to rule after changes in the expenses policy which include a \u00a36 cap on lunch costs. 9.30am: NUJ accuses BBC Feb 21: BBC staff to work to rule Feb 21: BBC staff lambast Dyke Talk about it here",

      "bodyText": "A record-breaking 929m text messages were sent in Britain last month, according to official number-crunching from the Mobile Data Association. And now the MDA says February will be a landmark month, when a staggering 1bn text messages will be sent across UK mobile phone networks. Valentine's Day has already been confirmed as the busiest day in February - between 22m and 25m messages were exchanged between phones. Despite the hype around Valentine's text messages, it appears the British are conforming to their image as a reserved nation - well-wishing proved much more popular than romantic gestures. The busiest day of the year was not February 14 but January 1, when more than 30m messages were tapped out. The MDA, which collects figures from the four mobile networks, has now revised its estimates because of the evident boom in text messaging. It originally said the 1bn barrier would be broken in the summer but it now expects this to happen four months earlier. \"Text messaging is a new language and a new way of communicating in a discreet way. \"It's not just for consumers - messaging has now become a business habit,\" said Mike Short, chairman of the MDA. Mobile phone users also went text-message crazy over the festive season, with more than 750m messages sent in December. Text messaging has experienced exponential growth in the past year. Tellingly, the figures from January are almost three times those recorded 12 months ago. While it has become something of a phenomenon in the UK, it has also permeated other markets. The UK now represents about 8% of the total global text message industry, which is expected to witness more than 200bn messages worldwide this year. And the method of communication has helped save lives. Last week a British tourist was rescused from a sea storm off the coast of Thailand after she contacted her boyfriend in Britain. She made contact with the Falmouth Coast Guard, who got in touch with their counterparts in the Pacific.",

      "bodyText": "Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier has reported a slip in profits, a day after the government referred its latest acquisition to competition watchdogs. Reed's \u00a33bn purchase of US rival Harcourt General in October last year increased access to the lucrative American educational publishing market. But an internet investment programme also saddled the group with massive restructuring costs. As a result, adjusted pre-tax profits for last year fell from \u00a3710m in 1999 to \u00a3690m. Although analysts gave a broad thumbs up to the Harcourt acquisition, Reed's shares have weakened following the government's decision to refer the move to the Competition Commission. Reed argues the Harcourt deal gives the company just 15% of the science, technical and medical publishing market in the UK and is not a threat to competition. If the Harcourt deal receives watchdog clearance, the educational publishing market will provide 15% of Reed's earnings, which last year rose by 9% to \u00a33.3bn. Reed also publishes magazines and books in the science, medical, legal and business sectors. Crispin Davis, chief executive of Reed Elsevier, brushed off news of the government enquiry and predicted the group would reach its ambitious growth targets. \"2001 should see Reed Elsevier move very significantly towards our stated goal of above market revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth in 2002 and beyond,\" said Mr Davis. Reed remains a media sector favourite because of its status as a \"defensive\" stock. It is less exposed to downturns in advertising growth and core markets such as education do not suffer as much during an economic slump. Shares in Reed, listed as Reed International in the UK, rose 1.6% to 645p in early trading.",

It has caused outrage in Pamplona, where the bull runs held during the San Fermin festival in July are a tourism money-spinner as well as a revered tradition. \"Most tourists are horrified when they realise that the bulls that run in the mornings are tortured and killed in the bull-ring later in the day,\" the actor claimed in a letter supporting People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. \"Please tell me when this bloody event, which should have been consigned to history ages ago, will come to an end,\" she asked city authorities.

The mortgage supply arm of Britannic Assurance is also launching its new brand name this Friday with a multi-million-pound TV, press and poster advertising campaign. To coincide with its \u00a31m sponsorship of Channel 4 sitcom Frasier - which begins on Friday - a TV ad campaign will launch on the same day. Created by ad agency Camp Chipperfield Hill Murray, the TV executions have the strapline: \"Turn your money in to Britannic Money\". The campaign will run for a month in the first instance. Naked Communications has provided media strategy and Optimedia has handled the media buying. A poster and press campaign support the television ads. In addition, the website has just gone live. Britannic Money is the new name of First Active Financial, which Britannic Assurance acquired last year. The company's main product is a current-account mortgage. But the website will offer other products in association with online partners, according to Britannic Money head of marketing Matt Smith. \"Internet customers will be able to access other products, where we think our brand is right for a tie-up. \"Ee won't be offering discounted sports shoes but we will offer a discount club where members can buy holidays or leisure products,\" said Mr Smith. The company will also unveil an online share-dealing product in the near future. \"Our flexible mortgage underpins everything but we want to offer the tool for an holistic approach to finances. \"We can be a one-stop shop if you want us to be,\" said Smith.

To others he is the most gifted journalist of his generation, a moral man with his finger on the pulse of Middle England.

      "byline": "Andy Beckett",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is one particular story that former staff of the Daily Mail like to tell about the politics, in the broadest sense, of their old paper. A while ago, the newsdesk there noticed a report from a local press agency. A young baby had died from being fed adult food. The Mail immediately got excited: it could interview the grieving parents, make the tragedy the basis for a campaign, and warn the nation of a previously unsuspected danger. </p> <p>The couple were contacted, and offered \u00a3250 for an interview. They agreed, and talked eloquently and at length. A double-page spread - the Mail's traditional mark of a significant article - was put aside in the paper. For the photograph, the parents, who were not well off, were encouraged to look smart: the husband in a suit, his wife in a dress, both of them holding hands. </p> <p>The morning the feature appeared, it was judged a success at the Mail. The article was by turns sensitive, alarming and full of useful advice. Paul Dacre, the editor then and now, approved - and from him all official sentiments flowed. But then, at lunchtime, Dacre's tall, slightly stooping figure was spotted beneath one of the television monitors hanging from the low ceiling of the open-plan office. Everybody nearby, as it was usually in their interests to, stopped work and looked and listened. </p> <p>Dacre was watching the one o'clock news with his narrow eyes: on it were the bereaved couple, with messier hair than before, wearing tracksuits and trainers, smoking: not the Mail's sort of people at all. The editor, who is 52, spotlessly shirtsleeved, brisk in his diction, with hair like a cerebral Tory minister, was heard to growl. Then he spoke: \"These people couldn't bring up a fucking hamster!\" </p> <p>Real life tends to disappoint the Daily Mail. That, however, has never undermined this thick, grey tombstone of a tabloid. In more than a century of publication, with a certainty and thoroughness perhaps unique among newspapers, the Mail has never stopped trying to tidy the world to its preferred patterns. As the globe has grown more baffling and volatile and threatening - and in Britain the Mail has been instrumental in creating this impression - so the paper's solutions have grown clearer and more consistent. In 1940, it sold an average of about 1,400,000 copies a day ; in 1970, about 1,900,000; in 2000, approaching 2,400,000. </p> <p>These days the Daily Express, the Mail's historic rival, struggles to sell a million; and these remaining readers have been so aggressively courted by the Mail of late that, this week, the Express has begun publicly attacking the paper for \"lies\" and \"humbug\". The Mail is retaliating - \"Concern As Express Sales Go Into Freefall\" - in inimitable fashion. If recent circulation trends continue, it will become Britain's favourite newspaper at some point be tween 2005 and 2010. </p> <p>It is already probably the most powerful. It is a paper of the middle class, in particular the suburban and southern varieties. As these people have grown more numerous and politically potent, it has flattered their aspirations and crystallised their fears, helped form their values and fanned their discontents. </p> <p>The intricacy of this to-and-fro can be gauged by the closeness of Mail readers to the newspaper's ideal: they are more likely to be married than the general population; more likely to own property; to have two or more cars; to vote Conservative. Yet only half of them do so habitually. The rest form the largest concentration of \"swing voters\", assumed to decide modern general elections, who can be reached through a single newspaper. </p> <p>However, to a slightly different sort of person - British liberals, leftwingers, anyone it has ever persecuted - the paper is not affirming but an affront. \"I stopped taking the Mail at the start of this year because it was bad for me,\" says one Labour MP who is attacked almost weekly. Mail reporters have repeatedly telephoned this politician's children. The MP has written to the paper with complaints and factual corrections, which \"they never publish\". One received this written response from a senior executive: \"You are a hypocrite.\" When a complaint is posted now, \"My stomach turns to water at what they are going to do to me for retaliating.\" </p> <p>In recent months, the Mail's b\u00eates noires, to use a favourite phrase of Mail executives, have included the ailing Princess Margaret (\"paying for her pursuit of pleasure\"), the BBC's new political editor Andrew Marr (\"Millbank Man\"), and a young Iraqi chef who \"has tried to sneak into Britain 20 times\". The paper batters such targets with front pages and features, columnists and diarists, all following the same line for days at a time. \"It is a propaganda machine not a newspaper,\" says a government minister. She, like almost all the politicians prepared to talk about the Mail, asked to remain anonymous. </p> <p>In a sense, the very strength of such reactions only feeds the tabloid's perceived importance. The rest of the media, for one thing, often follows whichever newspaper has the most controversial stories. And the Mail's large middle-class readership makes it particularly closely read by broadcasters, who want to attract that audience. Coincidentally but perhaps appropriately, Dacre's brother Nigel is head of ITN's ITV news. </p> <p>The Mail often starts national debates; even more often, it sets their parameters. For example, the receiving of asylum-seekers, whose hooded, dehumanised profiles have crowded the paper's pages remorselessly in recent years, now appears to most Britons as a problem and a danger, not an opportunity or a national duty. </p> <p>Last September's protests against petrol taxes, which had been revved up by Mail editorials for months, became a people's crusade and not special pleading by the polluting classes. As for Europe, the family, equal rights for gay people, the rise of crime or otherwise - each of these complex issues has been successfully simplified by the paper into a question of identity or morality, where the Mail is famously comfortable, rather than economics or history or sociology, where its rightwing certainties would come up against awkward facts. Modern British politics, it often seems, has been remade in the Mail's image. </p> <p>This has made some of the government's ambitions, for the time being at least, impossible to achieve. \"The things we've lost on,\" says a minister, \"such as [the repeal of the anti-gay] Clause 28, are because of the climate they've created.\" Recently, with an election expected, the paper's general hostility has grown close to hysterical. Earlier this month, one of its columnists, Simon Heffer, predicted that continued Labour rule would lead to 14m illegal immigrants in Britain, almost half the country's military personnel being disabled people, and \"girls of nine\" receiving \"the morning-after pill from school dinner ladies\". One of Blair's closest advisors concludes: \"The Mail have gone into kill mode.\" </p> <p>Other Labour politicians, however, take a rather different view of the paper. \"It is extremely well-written and attractively presented,\" said David Blunkett, the secretary of state for education, at the 1998 party conference. The same year, when Dacre's predecessor Sir David English died, his memorial service was attended by, among others, Tony Blair, William Hague and Margaret Thatcher. In 1999, when the Mail's proprietor Viscount Rothermere also died, the prime minister read a lesson at the service of thanksgiving. </p> <p>That autumn, relations appeared to cool. Blair famously attacked \"the forces of conservatism\". Labour began publishing a Daily Mail Monitor, to counter the newspaper's \"myths\" about its policies. But the editor of the Monitor, the MP Gerald Kaufman, now says that his publication is \"quiescent\". Has the government's view of the Mail changed? With slow emphasis, he says: \"The Daily Mail is an extraordinarily able and well-conducted paper.\" </p> <p>Heffer has been appointed to a Home Office panel reviewing jail sentencing. Last year, perhaps most revealingly of all, a personal memo written by the prime minister was leaked to the press. Under the heading \"Touchstone Issues\", Blair said his government should please \"gut British instinct\" by being \"tough\" on teenage criminals and asylum seekers, respecting the family more, and better understanding people such as the imprisoned Norfolk farmer Tony Martin who defended their property by force. All these points had been specifically raised, in a similar order, in a Mail editorial. </p> <p>The Conservative party also appears at times to be the paper's junior partner. A grinning John Major attended its 21st birthday as \"a compact newspaper\" (it is not, it insists, a tabloid); three years later, the Mail backed John Redwood's attempt to topple him. Many of William Hague's initiatives as Tory leader - his promises to cut petrol duty, to detain all asylum seekers, to look more kindly on the defence of property with firearms - have also come straight, it seems, from the paper's editorials; yet one of these recently described the opposition as \"a stumbling, incoherent shambles ... that has profound implications for the health of our democracy.\" </p> <p>In such grand, impatient statements there increasingly lurks a sense of the Mail as a sort of political party, a replacement for the opposition, even a prototype government-in-waiting. \"I was talking to Dacre at a party,\" says a senior government official, \"and he said, 'You've got a big majority. The other papers are on your side. You've had it easy for too long. We're going to see you off.' And I thought, 'If you want to be prime minister, then run.' \" </p> <p>Since Dacre became editor in 1992, the same year that the Tories began to disintegrate, \"Dacre has taken David English's middle-class siege mentality and turned it into a daily polemic,\" says a longtime observer of the Mail's moods. Is the paper actually malicious? And where does the anger come from? </p> <p>Kensington High Street, in smartest west London, is not the first place you would probably imagine such discontent being perfected. The newspaper's offices are above the biggest local temple to Blair-era prosperity, an upmarket department store called Barker's. They have a black marble entrance, and a gold clock, and corporate lettering of great width and confidence. A long escalator ascends, smoothly and slowly, to a glass-roofed atrium six storeys high. </p> <p>There are indoor trees and balconies, see-through lifts and a spiral staircase, a whole sealed kingdom of Mail-related enterprise: the Daily Mail and General Trust, its parent company, also owns the Mail on Sunday, the free commuter paper Metro, the London Evening Standard, Teletext, several websites, radio stations here and abroad, local newspapers, financial services providers, and an organiser of trade fairs. Were it not for the slightly jittery-looking men in shirtsleeves, you might forget you were at a tabloid newspaper. </p> <p>Dacre joined in 1980. He was a middle-class boy from the north London suburbs who had been to University College School, a liberal private school in Hampstead, on a scholarship. His father, Peter Dacre, was a successful journalist on the Sunday Express; the family used to analyse the Sunday papers over lunch. When Dacre junior went to Leeds University in 1967, he immediately got involved in the student newspaper. Within five weeks, he was a features editor, devising double-page spreads of a heavy-type directness that any Mail reader would recognise.</p> <p> Their politics, however, might come as a shock: gay people and drug takers were sympathetically portrayed, \"welfare state misfits\" were described as victims, and Enoch Powell's warnings about immigration were scorned. Dacre was leftwing, and remained so until the late 70s, when the Daily Express, the first national newspaper he worked for, sent him to America. </p> <p>The apparent vigour and prosperity of the people he met there, and their seeming commitment to the family (Dacre had married quite young), affected him strongly. Suddenly Britain looked tribal and declining, a socialist cul-de-sac. When he came back to London in 1981, having been hired by the Mail, Dacre was a fierce free-marketeer and social conservative, at least as Thatcherite as the new Tory government. And this he has remained, it seems, ever since. </p> <p>As well as being editor of the Mail, he is editor-in-chief of its major sister papers. His superiors English and Rothermere have both died. His new proprietor, the current Lord Rothermere, is relatively young and inexperienced. Dacre's opinions, according to everyone I spoke to, dominate the Mail's worldview - and are becoming more definite. \"He deals with everything at the level of emotion,\" says someone who knows him well. \"He thinks politics is basically common sense. He can't understand why people would disagree with him.\" </p> <p>Dacre's instincts are steered by a simple morality. There are good people and bad people in the world. The good people are self-reliant, traditional in their beliefs, suspicious of officialdom, and want to better themselves. They generally work in the private sector. They are middle class, or would like to be. They are conservatives with a small 'c'. </p> <p>This can mean anyone from the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence and his parents, for whom the Mail has very self-consciously campaigned, to the more morally austere Labour ministers. The paper currently approves of Blunkett, Paul Boateng, Jack Straw in his more severe moments, and occasionally still, Blair himself (\"pretty impressive\" when he visits Kensington, according to a Mail executive). There remains a clean-cut, illiberal side to New Labour that appeals to the paper, and vice versa. </p> <p>Like the government, the Mail sees good people threatened by bad. By criminals, by people pushing dangerous ideas, by people setting a poor example, whether living off benefits on a council estate or being over-indulgent and rich. The job of the paper is to describe this ceaseless battle, while drawing the lessons from it which will enable the good people - assumed to be the majority of the British population - to win. </p> <p>Now, Dacre himself does not live precisely like his idealised subjects and readers in Middle England. Last year, he earned \u00a3727,000. He has a chauffeur. Until quite recently, he lived part of the time in the most deliciously secluded street in Islington, the north London borough synonymous in his newspaper with decadent metropolitan liberalism. </p> <p>But this prosperity should not be mistaken for a hypocritical flashiness. Dacre is shy outside the office: he does not get photographed much at parties, he is not close friends with politicians, he regards editors who enjoy being public figures as unwise and uncommitted. He would rather be watching which papers people are reading on the train, or in the pub when he risks a quiet drink after work, some time after 10pm. </p> <p>Then he is driven home, either to a London flat or to his Sussex village and his wife, Kathleen, who teaches drama, and their two sons, and their neighbours whose \"sensible opinions\" he values, to receive the first edition of every national newspaper at midnight and call his subordinates with fresh orders. </p> <p>Dacre is back in at 9am. By 11am, his next wave of views about the issues of the day is forming. There is a meeting in his office for his lieutenants, carefully choreographed: him sitting at his large dark desk, which stands confidently near the middle of the room, leaning back in his high black leather chair, his feet often up on the desktop; the news editor, Dacre's main intermediary, in a lone chair facing him; the other executives on two sofas in an L-shape, an eternity of carpet away. The room, with its cream panelling and antiques, its stripes on the sofa covers and books about the second world war, could be a parody of a Mail reader's decor. But everything at this newspaper is done completely in earnest. </p> <p>The editor may be aroused by an obscure news item, a vague sense of outrage, a hunch about how to make political waves. Within a few seconds, his voice will rise from low and slightly throaty to a bellow, suggesting headlines, lines of attack, how the articles should be written and illustrated, whether a campaign should be launched. He will hammer the air with his hands. He will wave his long arms. He will swear and summon up reporters. And the news editor, in his delicate armchair, will need to know how often the Mail has done this story before. </p> <p>Once Dacre's wishes have been disseminated - or, often, in advance of that - the journalists will know what is required. \"You kind of know what the obsessions are,\" says one who recently left the paper. \"And you very much know you've got to do a story in a specific way.\" This polemic-driven approach can have unintended consequences: \"Dacre will express some random opinion, and forget about it,\" says another ex-reporter. \"It will dominate the paper for days.\" </p> <p>Out in the untidy world which its journalists have to probe, even the facts the Mail seeks are closely steered by its beliefs. \"One of the first things the news editor will ask you is, 'What kind of house have they got?', \" says someone who worked closely with him until recently. And back in the office, as afternoon turns into evening, such facts as have been gathered that day undergo a further process of refinement. A politician would call it \"spin\". Dacre calls it \"orchestration\". </p> <p>For two or three hours, a second daily melodrama unfolds: this time not in his office, but out in the open-plan, where all the staff can see. The editor emerges from his corridor. He strides over to where the first rough pages of the newspaper have been arranged for him. Then he begins to change things. Unsuitable headlines are dismissed. Introductions to pieces are transformed. Pages are reshuffled, redesigned, torn up and abandoned. </p> <p>Much of this happens on other newspapers, of course; but not with the Mail's intensity. Dacre and his lieutenants proudly describe their evenings as \"pure adrenaline\", \"crashing through\". Sometimes, the message of the day is so closely controlled that almost exactly the same introductory sentence will appear in different articles. </p> <p>Not all the paper is overt politics, of course. But the softer daily stories about animals, the self-improvement features, the straight-faced serialisations of apocalyptic new age speculations - these also emphasise, in a more gentle fashion, the importance of aspiration and domesticity, the need to distrust official explanations, the dangerousness of the world outside your neat home. </p> <p>This has always been the Mail's recipe. On May 4 1896, its first front page included \"Rioting On The Continent\", \"Reading Murders: Sensational Letters Of Confession\", and \"Woman's Realm: Two Columns Of Special Interest For The Home\". From the start, too, the paper had a sense of its own importance. Within two years, it was claiming \"the largest circulation in the world\" and had embarked on a campaign against the incompetent conduct of the Boer war. This contempt for bureaucrats and politicians quickly swelled into a desire for more formal political status. Lord Northcliffe, the Mail's founder, insisted on a seat at the Versailles peace conference in 1918 (he was refused); in 1929, the Mail and Express set up their own, fleetingly successful, Empire Free Trade party to fight by-elections. </p> <p>But the Mail was not really a political party. In its dictatorial culture, strange notions could take root without consideration of their reception in the outside world. From about 1930, when the paper was in the middle of a long flirtation with fascism, until the early 70s, its circulation stagnated or fell. Social change in general and the 60s in particular proved hard for the Mail to swallow. The Mail has been hostile about that decade ever since. </p> <p>By 1970, a merger with the Express was being negotiated. It took the collapse of these talks, a new editor (English), proprietor (Rothermere), and a recommendation from the management consultants McKinseys to relaunch as an imitation of semi-respectable, women-orientated American tabloids such as Newsday and the New York Post, to create the version of the Mail that has thrived since. </p> <p>You could see its Christmas party as its annual conference. Last year, like every year, it was at Claridge's in Mayfair in central London. The hotel's entire ground floor had been hired: ballrooms, lounges, long shiny-floored corridors. It was as if messy modern Britain had never existed, as if a Mail lifestyle feature had been brought to life. </p> <p>The Mail employees arrived with their wives and husbands. No one else appeared to have been invited. They straightened their dresses and ties, and took deep breaths by the cloakrooms. Then they walked, very erect, towards the party. In the first room, an enormous slab of ice stood under the hot lights. On it had been carved the Daily Mail logo and those of the company's other main titles, and in front of it stood Paul Dacre. </p> <p>He looked quietly satisfied. A few senior staff exchanged careful smiles and shoulder pats with their editor. Yet most of the staff kept a safe distance, in small groups, drinking the champagne. Everyone seemed happy but guarded, like junior officers at a regimental drinks party. It was all over by 9.30pm - there was another paper to produce the next day - but a long line of company cars with drivers was waiting outside in the cold. </p> <p>If journalists at the Mail play by its rules, from wearing skirts and not eating at their desks (if they are women) to always taking off their jacket in the office (if they are men) to just working very hard, they are very generously rewarded. Staff and ex-staff, in turn, are often loyal. </p> <p>Like Mail readers, plenty of them turn out not to share the paper's politics, but they buy into its broader culture. They are proud of its thoroughness and determination and the resources it grants reporters - its famous \"professionalism\". More quietly, they may relish its cruelty and moralism. Enjoying other people's misfortunes is, after all, the great unspoken motivation for producing and consuming journalism. </p> <p>The trouble comes when the sheer rigidity of the Mail, the repetitiveness, the regular nastiness needed to keep the paper's world in place, starts to grate or feel out of date. Staff who do not fit the paper's preferences are brutally treated, even by the standards of this industry. But reporters have been leaving in slightly worrying numbers in recent years, it is felt in Kensington. There is a faint but growing anxiety that the tabloid's best-known writers, such as Lynda Lee-Potter, Nigel Dempster and Ann Leslie are approaching retirement age. Young stars are proving harder to bring on than at other papers. </p> <p>The readers, however, have yet to tire of the Mail's old-fashioned recipe - its single thick section, its fusty typefaces - or to react against its politics as they did in the 30s. Yet you do wonder whether these millions of people, who are mostly sharing in the Blair boom, will continue to welcome the bleak view of Britain the paper puts out. And if many of them, as seems likely, vote Labour again at the general election, will Dacre still be able to claim perfect empathy? </p> <p>There is much talk at the paper now about being less \"aggressive\", \"lightening up\", avoiding \"self-parody\". Dacre wants single mothers and ethnic minorities to be criticised less, as long as they behave respectably in his eyes; a call for the decriminalisation of drugs is a possibility. There is even a suggestion that the Mail and its leftwing enemies can become allies, over the social breakdowns caused by the global free market. </p> <p>But such philosophical questions are not dwelled on. At headquarters, whoever is defending what the Mail is currently doing usually reaches for the shield of sales figures before too long. As long as circulation is moving like the up escalator, inexorably and endlessly in the atrium below, then screaming at staff and bullying the subjects of articles on their doorsteps at dawn and making every complex real-world event into a simple cautionary tale is felt, officially, to be justified. </p> <p>In the end, the Daily Mail tries to have it all ways. It justifies itself by temporary commercial success one minute, by eternal moral values the next. It says it admires aspiration, but loathes those who get above themselves. It idealises the home, but recognises no one's privacy. It wants law and order, but not speed cameras. It wants unfettered capitalism, but not excessive profits. It calls itself a female paper, but reserves its worst venom for prominent women. It calls itself the straightforward voice of Middle England - and seeks to impose that imagined community's values on everyone else - but its proprietors are metropolitan aristocrats, controlling its parent company by arcane share arrangements. </p> <p>It is only a paper.

      "bodyText": "There is one particular story that former staff of the Daily Mail like to tell about the politics, in the broadest sense, of their old paper. A while ago, the newsdesk there noticed a report from a local press agency. A young baby had died from being fed adult food. The Mail immediately got excited: it could interview the grieving parents, make the tragedy the basis for a campaign, and warn the nation of a previously unsuspected danger. The couple were contacted, and offered \u00a3250 for an interview. They agreed, and talked eloquently and at length. A double-page spread - the Mail's traditional mark of a significant article - was put aside in the paper. For the photograph, the parents, who were not well off, were encouraged to look smart: the husband in a suit, his wife in a dress, both of them holding hands. The morning the feature appeared, it was judged a success at the Mail. The article was by turns sensitive, alarming and full of useful advice. Paul Dacre, the editor then and now, approved - and from him all official sentiments flowed. But then, at lunchtime, Dacre's tall, slightly stooping figure was spotted beneath one of the television monitors hanging from the low ceiling of the open-plan office. Everybody nearby, as it was usually in their interests to, stopped work and looked and listened. Dacre was watching the one o'clock news with his narrow eyes: on it were the bereaved couple, with messier hair than before, wearing tracksuits and trainers, smoking: not the Mail's sort of people at all. The editor, who is 52, spotlessly shirtsleeved, brisk in his diction, with hair like a cerebral Tory minister, was heard to growl. Then he spoke: \"These people couldn't bring up a fucking hamster!\" Real life tends to disappoint the Daily Mail. That, however, has never undermined this thick, grey tombstone of a tabloid. In more than a century of publication, with a certainty and thoroughness perhaps unique among newspapers, the Mail has never stopped trying to tidy the world to its preferred patterns. As the globe has grown more baffling and volatile and threatening - and in Britain the Mail has been instrumental in creating this impression - so the paper's solutions have grown clearer and more consistent. In 1940, it sold an average of about 1,400,000 copies a day ; in 1970, about 1,900,000; in 2000, approaching 2,400,000. These days the Daily Express, the Mail's historic rival, struggles to sell a million; and these remaining readers have been so aggressively courted by the Mail of late that, this week, the Express has begun publicly attacking the paper for \"lies\" and \"humbug\". The Mail is retaliating - \"Concern As Express Sales Go Into Freefall\" - in inimitable fashion. If recent circulation trends continue, it will become Britain's favourite newspaper at some point be tween 2005 and 2010. It is already probably the most powerful. It is a paper of the middle class, in particular the suburban and southern varieties. As these people have grown more numerous and politically potent, it has flattered their aspirations and crystallised their fears, helped form their values and fanned their discontents. The intricacy of this to-and-fro can be gauged by the closeness of Mail readers to the newspaper's ideal: they are more likely to be married than the general population; more likely to own property; to have two or more cars; to vote Conservative. Yet only half of them do so habitually. The rest form the largest concentration of \"swing voters\", assumed to decide modern general elections, who can be reached through a single newspaper. However, to a slightly different sort of person - British liberals, leftwingers, anyone it has ever persecuted - the paper is not affirming but an affront. \"I stopped taking the Mail at the start of this year because it was bad for me,\" says one Labour MP who is attacked almost weekly. Mail reporters have repeatedly telephoned this politician's children. The MP has written to the paper with complaints and factual corrections, which \"they never publish\". One received this written response from a senior executive: \"You are a hypocrite.\" When a complaint is posted now, \"My stomach turns to water at what they are going to do to me for retaliating.\" In recent months, the Mail's b\u00eates noires, to use a favourite phrase of Mail executives, have included the ailing Princess Margaret (\"paying for her pursuit of pleasure\"), the BBC's new political editor Andrew Marr (\"Millbank Man\"), and a young Iraqi chef who \"has tried to sneak into Britain 20 times\". The paper batters such targets with front pages and features, columnists and diarists, all following the same line for days at a time. \"It is a propaganda machine not a newspaper,\" says a government minister. She, like almost all the politicians prepared to talk about the Mail, asked to remain anonymous. In a sense, the very strength of such reactions only feeds the tabloid's perceived importance. The rest of the media, for one thing, often follows whichever newspaper has the most controversial stories. And the Mail's large middle-class readership makes it particularly closely read by broadcasters, who want to attract that audience. Coincidentally but perhaps appropriately, Dacre's brother Nigel is head of ITN's ITV news. The Mail often starts national debates; even more often, it sets their parameters. For example, the receiving of asylum-seekers, whose hooded, dehumanised profiles have crowded the paper's pages remorselessly in recent years, now appears to most Britons as a problem and a danger, not an opportunity or a national duty. Last September's protests against petrol taxes, which had been revved up by Mail editorials for months, became a people's crusade and not special pleading by the polluting classes. As for Europe, the family, equal rights for gay people, the rise of crime or otherwise - each of these complex issues has been successfully simplified by the paper into a question of identity or morality, where the Mail is famously comfortable, rather than economics or history or sociology, where its rightwing certainties would come up against awkward facts. Modern British politics, it often seems, has been remade in the Mail's image. This has made some of the government's ambitions, for the time being at least, impossible to achieve. \"The things we've lost on,\" says a minister, \"such as [the repeal of the anti-gay] Clause 28, are because of the climate they've created.\" Recently, with an election expected, the paper's general hostility has grown close to hysterical. Earlier this month, one of its columnists, Simon Heffer, predicted that continued Labour rule would lead to 14m illegal immigrants in Britain, almost half the country's military personnel being disabled people, and \"girls of nine\" receiving \"the morning-after pill from school dinner ladies\". One of Blair's closest advisors concludes: \"The Mail have gone into kill mode.\" Other Labour politicians, however, take a rather different view of the paper. \"It is extremely well-written and attractively presented,\" said David Blunkett, the secretary of state for education, at the 1998 party conference. The same year, when Dacre's predecessor Sir David English died, his memorial service was attended by, among others, Tony Blair, William Hague and Margaret Thatcher. In 1999, when the Mail's proprietor Viscount Rothermere also died, the prime minister read a lesson at the service of thanksgiving. That autumn, relations appeared to cool. Blair famously attacked \"the forces of conservatism\". Labour began publishing a Daily Mail Monitor, to counter the newspaper's \"myths\" about its policies. But the editor of the Monitor, the MP Gerald Kaufman, now says that his publication is \"quiescent\". Has the government's view of the Mail changed? With slow emphasis, he says: \"The Daily Mail is an extraordinarily able and well-conducted paper.\" Heffer has been appointed to a Home Office panel reviewing jail sentencing. Last year, perhaps most revealingly of all, a personal memo written by the prime minister was leaked to the press. Under the heading \"Touchstone Issues\", Blair said his government should please \"gut British instinct\" by being \"tough\" on teenage criminals and asylum seekers, respecting the family more, and better understanding people such as the imprisoned Norfolk farmer Tony Martin who defended their property by force. All these points had been specifically raised, in a similar order, in a Mail editorial. The Conservative party also appears at times to be the paper's junior partner. A grinning John Major attended its 21st birthday as \"a compact newspaper\" (it is not, it insists, a tabloid); three years later, the Mail backed John Redwood's attempt to topple him. Many of William Hague's initiatives as Tory leader - his promises to cut petrol duty, to detain all asylum seekers, to look more kindly on the defence of property with firearms - have also come straight, it seems, from the paper's editorials; yet one of these recently described the opposition as \"a stumbling, incoherent shambles ... that has profound implications for the health of our democracy.\" In such grand, impatient statements there increasingly lurks a sense of the Mail as a sort of political party, a replacement for the opposition, even a prototype government-in-waiting. \"I was talking to Dacre at a party,\" says a senior government official, \"and he said, 'You've got a big majority. The other papers are on your side. You've had it easy for too long. We're going to see you off.' And I thought, 'If you want to be prime minister, then run.' \" Since Dacre became editor in 1992, the same year that the Tories began to disintegrate, \"Dacre has taken David English's middle-class siege mentality and turned it into a daily polemic,\" says a longtime observer of the Mail's moods. Is the paper actually malicious? And where does the anger come from? Kensington High Street, in smartest west London, is not the first place you would probably imagine such discontent being perfected. The newspaper's offices are above the biggest local temple to Blair-era prosperity, an upmarket department store called Barker's. They have a black marble entrance, and a gold clock, and corporate lettering of great width and confidence. A long escalator ascends, smoothly and slowly, to a glass-roofed atrium six storeys high. There are indoor trees and balconies, see-through lifts and a spiral staircase, a whole sealed kingdom of Mail-related enterprise: the Daily Mail and General Trust, its parent company, also owns the Mail on Sunday, the free commuter paper Metro, the London Evening Standard, Teletext, several websites, radio stations here and abroad, local newspapers, financial services providers, and an organiser of trade fairs. Were it not for the slightly jittery-looking men in shirtsleeves, you might forget you were at a tabloid newspaper. Dacre joined in 1980. He was a middle-class boy from the north London suburbs who had been to University College School, a liberal private school in Hampstead, on a scholarship. His father, Peter Dacre, was a successful journalist on the Sunday Express; the family used to analyse the Sunday papers over lunch. When Dacre junior went to Leeds University in 1967, he immediately got involved in the student newspaper. Within five weeks, he was a features editor, devising double-page spreads of a heavy-type directness that any Mail reader would recognise. Their politics, however, might come as a shock: gay people and drug takers were sympathetically portrayed, \"welfare state misfits\" were described as victims, and Enoch Powell's warnings about immigration were scorned. Dacre was leftwing, and remained so until the late 70s, when the Daily Express, the first national newspaper he worked for, sent him to America. The apparent vigour and prosperity of the people he met there, and their seeming commitment to the family (Dacre had married quite young), affected him strongly. Suddenly Britain looked tribal and declining, a socialist cul-de-sac. When he came back to London in 1981, having been hired by the Mail, Dacre was a fierce free-marketeer and social conservative, at least as Thatcherite as the new Tory government. And this he has remained, it seems, ever since. As well as being editor of the Mail, he is editor-in-chief of its major sister papers. His superiors English and Rothermere have both died. His new proprietor, the current Lord Rothermere, is relatively young and inexperienced. Dacre's opinions, according to everyone I spoke to, dominate the Mail's worldview - and are becoming more definite. \"He deals with everything at the level of emotion,\" says someone who knows him well. \"He thinks politics is basically common sense. He can't understand why people would disagree with him.\" Dacre's instincts are steered by a simple morality. There are good people and bad people in the world. The good people are self-reliant, traditional in their beliefs, suspicious of officialdom, and want to better themselves. They generally work in the private sector. They are middle class, or would like to be. They are conservatives with a small 'c'. This can mean anyone from the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence and his parents, for whom the Mail has very self-consciously campaigned, to the more morally austere Labour ministers. The paper currently approves of Blunkett, Paul Boateng, Jack Straw in his more severe moments, and occasionally still, Blair himself (\"pretty impressive\" when he visits Kensington, according to a Mail executive). There remains a clean-cut, illiberal side to New Labour that appeals to the paper, and vice versa. Like the government, the Mail sees good people threatened by bad. By criminals, by people pushing dangerous ideas, by people setting a poor example, whether living off benefits on a council estate or being over-indulgent and rich. The job of the paper is to describe this ceaseless battle, while drawing the lessons from it which will enable the good people - assumed to be the majority of the British population - to win. Now, Dacre himself does not live precisely like his idealised subjects and readers in Middle England. Last year, he earned \u00a3727,000. He has a chauffeur. Until quite recently, he lived part of the time in the most deliciously secluded street in Islington, the north London borough synonymous in his newspaper with decadent metropolitan liberalism. But this prosperity should not be mistaken for a hypocritical flashiness. Dacre is shy outside the office: he does not get photographed much at parties, he is not close friends with politicians, he regards editors who enjoy being public figures as unwise and uncommitted. He would rather be watching which papers people are reading on the train, or in the pub when he risks a quiet drink after work, some time after 10pm. Then he is driven home, either to a London flat or to his Sussex village and his wife, Kathleen, who teaches drama, and their two sons, and their neighbours whose \"sensible opinions\" he values, to receive the first edition of every national newspaper at midnight and call his subordinates with fresh orders. Dacre is back in at 9am. By 11am, his next wave of views about the issues of the day is forming. There is a meeting in his office for his lieutenants, carefully choreographed: him sitting at his large dark desk, which stands confidently near the middle of the room, leaning back in his high black leather chair, his feet often up on the desktop; the news editor, Dacre's main intermediary, in a lone chair facing him; the other executives on two sofas in an L-shape, an eternity of carpet away. The room, with its cream panelling and antiques, its stripes on the sofa covers and books about the second world war, could be a parody of a Mail reader's decor. But everything at this newspaper is done completely in earnest. The editor may be aroused by an obscure news item, a vague sense of outrage, a hunch about how to make political waves. Within a few seconds, his voice will rise from low and slightly throaty to a bellow, suggesting headlines, lines of attack, how the articles should be written and illustrated, whether a campaign should be launched. He will hammer the air with his hands. He will wave his long arms. He will swear and summon up reporters. And the news editor, in his delicate armchair, will need to know how often the Mail has done this story before. Once Dacre's wishes have been disseminated - or, often, in advance of that - the journalists will know what is required. \"You kind of know what the obsessions are,\" says one who recently left the paper. \"And you very much know you've got to do a story in a specific way.\" This polemic-driven approach can have unintended consequences: \"Dacre will express some random opinion, and forget about it,\" says another ex-reporter. \"It will dominate the paper for days.\" Out in the untidy world which its journalists have to probe, even the facts the Mail seeks are closely steered by its beliefs. \"One of the first things the news editor will ask you is, 'What kind of house have they got?', \" says someone who worked closely with him until recently. And back in the office, as afternoon turns into evening, such facts as have been gathered that day undergo a further process of refinement. A politician would call it \"spin\". Dacre calls it \"orchestration\". For two or three hours, a second daily melodrama unfolds: this time not in his office, but out in the open-plan, where all the staff can see. The editor emerges from his corridor. He strides over to where the first rough pages of the newspaper have been arranged for him. Then he begins to change things. Unsuitable headlines are dismissed. Introductions to pieces are transformed. Pages are reshuffled, redesigned, torn up and abandoned. Much of this happens on other newspapers, of course; but not with the Mail's intensity. Dacre and his lieutenants proudly describe their evenings as \"pure adrenaline\", \"crashing through\". Sometimes, the message of the day is so closely controlled that almost exactly the same introductory sentence will appear in different articles. Not all the paper is overt politics, of course. But the softer daily stories about animals, the self-improvement features, the straight-faced serialisations of apocalyptic new age speculations - these also emphasise, in a more gentle fashion, the importance of aspiration and domesticity, the need to distrust official explanations, the dangerousness of the world outside your neat home. This has always been the Mail's recipe. On May 4 1896, its first front page included \"Rioting On The Continent\", \"Reading Murders: Sensational Letters Of Confession\", and \"Woman's Realm: Two Columns Of Special Interest For The Home\". From the start, too, the paper had a sense of its own importance. Within two years, it was claiming \"the largest circulation in the world\" and had embarked on a campaign against the incompetent conduct of the Boer war. This contempt for bureaucrats and politicians quickly swelled into a desire for more formal political status. Lord Northcliffe, the Mail's founder, insisted on a seat at the Versailles peace conference in 1918 (he was refused); in 1929, the Mail and Express set up their own, fleetingly successful, Empire Free Trade party to fight by-elections. But the Mail was not really a political party. In its dictatorial culture, strange notions could take root without consideration of their reception in the outside world. From about 1930, when the paper was in the middle of a long flirtation with fascism, until the early 70s, its circulation stagnated or fell. Social change in general and the 60s in particular proved hard for the Mail to swallow. The Mail has been hostile about that decade ever since. By 1970, a merger with the Express was being negotiated. It took the collapse of these talks, a new editor (English), proprietor (Rothermere), and a recommendation from the management consultants McKinseys to relaunch as an imitation of semi-respectable, women-orientated American tabloids such as Newsday and the New York Post, to create the version of the Mail that has thrived since. You could see its Christmas party as its annual conference. Last year, like every year, it was at Claridge's in Mayfair in central London. The hotel's entire ground floor had been hired: ballrooms, lounges, long shiny-floored corridors. It was as if messy modern Britain had never existed, as if a Mail lifestyle feature had been brought to life. The Mail employees arrived with their wives and husbands. No one else appeared to have been invited. They straightened their dresses and ties, and took deep breaths by the cloakrooms. Then they walked, very erect, towards the party. In the first room, an enormous slab of ice stood under the hot lights. On it had been carved the Daily Mail logo and those of the company's other main titles, and in front of it stood Paul Dacre. He looked quietly satisfied. A few senior staff exchanged careful smiles and shoulder pats with their editor. Yet most of the staff kept a safe distance, in small groups, drinking the champagne. Everyone seemed happy but guarded, like junior officers at a regimental drinks party. It was all over by 9.30pm - there was another paper to produce the next day - but a long line of company cars with drivers was waiting outside in the cold. If journalists at the Mail play by its rules, from wearing skirts and not eating at their desks (if they are women) to always taking off their jacket in the office (if they are men) to just working very hard, they are very generously rewarded. Staff and ex-staff, in turn, are often loyal. Like Mail readers, plenty of them turn out not to share the paper's politics, but they buy into its broader culture. They are proud of its thoroughness and determination and the resources it grants reporters - its famous \"professionalism\". More quietly, they may relish its cruelty and moralism. Enjoying other people's misfortunes is, after all, the great unspoken motivation for producing and consuming journalism. The trouble comes when the sheer rigidity of the Mail, the repetitiveness, the regular nastiness needed to keep the paper's world in place, starts to grate or feel out of date. Staff who do not fit the paper's preferences are brutally treated, even by the standards of this industry. But reporters have been leaving in slightly worrying numbers in recent years, it is felt in Kensington. There is a faint but growing anxiety that the tabloid's best-known writers, such as Lynda Lee-Potter, Nigel Dempster and Ann Leslie are approaching retirement age. Young stars are proving harder to bring on than at other papers. The readers, however, have yet to tire of the Mail's old-fashioned recipe - its single thick section, its fusty typefaces - or to react against its politics as they did in the 30s. Yet you do wonder whether these millions of people, who are mostly sharing in the Blair boom, will continue to welcome the bleak view of Britain the paper puts out. And if many of them, as seems likely, vote Labour again at the general election, will Dacre still be able to claim perfect empathy? There is much talk at the paper now about being less \"aggressive\", \"lightening up\", avoiding \"self-parody\". Dacre wants single mothers and ethnic minorities to be criticised less, as long as they behave respectably in his eyes; a call for the decriminalisation of drugs is a possibility. There is even a suggestion that the Mail and its leftwing enemies can become allies, over the social breakdowns caused by the global free market. But such philosophical questions are not dwelled on. At headquarters, whoever is defending what the Mail is currently doing usually reaches for the shield of sales figures before too long. As long as circulation is moving like the up escalator, inexorably and endlessly in the atrium below, then screaming at staff and bullying the subjects of articles on their doorsteps at dawn and making every complex real-world event into a simple cautionary tale is felt, officially, to be justified. In the end, the Daily Mail tries to have it all ways. It justifies itself by temporary commercial success one minute, by eternal moral values the next. It says it admires aspiration, but loathes those who get above themselves. It idealises the home, but recognises no one's privacy. It wants law and order, but not speed cameras. It wants unfettered capitalism, but not excessive profits. It calls itself a female paper, but reserves its worst venom for prominent women. It calls itself the straightforward voice of Middle England - and seeks to impose that imagined community's values on everyone else - but its proprietors are metropolitan aristocrats, controlling its parent company by arcane share arrangements. It is only a paper. The vast majority of Britons never even glance at it. And the hold it does have will loosen: no newspaper dominates for ever. The Mail's hold on the government, some Labour politicians say, is already slackening: less nervy attention is paid to every attack; the exclusive briefings are no longer quite so numerous; there is a new willingness to confront the paper. Last November, it filled its pages with retired generals to condemn the government's \"plans\" for a \"Euro army\". The government, says one of Labour's main tacticians, \"took a very particular strategic decision to use the row to get our facts out\". Blair said the Mail was exaggerating. Opinion polls agreed with him. \"I think it has occurred to everyone from the top down,\" says a minister, \"that some people are so relentlessly opposed that they are the enemy.

And with the Conservatives most likely marooned in opposition, the paper may be steaming into less familiar ideological waters. Mail insiders now refer to its previous decades of strict loyalty to the Tories as \"slavish sycophancy\". Already, in the paper's most unyielding defences of traditional values, the shadow of another country's politics can be discerned. Last month, as President George W Bush was assembling his government of christian moralists and hard capitalists, Paul Dacre was back in his favourite country. He returned, by all accounts, enthused.",

      "body": "<p>The explosive growth in mobile telephone text messaging yesterday enabled the IT services group Logica to offset a disappointing performance in its US business and report better than expected sales and profit figures. </p> <p>Logica systems now handles the majority of the estimated 7bn text messages sent each month internationally. </p> <p>A technology shares sell-off following a big drop in the value of the Nasdaq index on Tuesday knocked the price of Logica stock sharply, and it closed down 141p at \u00a314.54p. </p> <p>Chief executive Martin Read was at a loss to explain the fall in the shares. </p> <p>\"When you've just delivered a pre-tax profits increase of 52% - a figure that is at the top end of most analysts' expectations - and your share price then falls 10%, it does seem a bit perverse,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Market conditions are generally good and we're looking forward to another year of strong performance. </p> <p>\"When you keep on delivering on the figures you just have to let the share price scenario take care of itself.\" </p> <p>Most analysts welcomed figures for the six months to December 31 that showed revenues up 25% to \u00a3505m, pre-tax profits up 52% at \u00a364.8m and a 33% dividend rise. </p> <p>Some observers do not believe text messaging annual growth rates of 70-90% can be sustained. Mr Read said: \"I simply don't agree with the people who say that the text messaging world is dead. The average person in Japan, where there are some of the most advanced mobile services, sends 300 text messages per year, but in Germany that figure is only 30 - and in the US it is even less.\" </p> <p>Mr Read predicted that even when the growth in text messaging does slow the big mobile network operators are likely to buy into more advanced messaging systems that will allow customers to send sound and images. </p> <p>\"The telcos have spent a fortune on their third-generation licences and they have to make them pay. </p> <p>\"They need to get as much volume through their networks as possible, and offer value-added services. We're what they need.\" </p> <p>A Deutsche Bank telecoms analyst, David Rees, agreed: \"For next-generation messaging platforms .. the group is uniquely positioned.\" </p> <p>Telecoms accounts for about half of Logica's annual revenues, but fees from the energy and utilities sectors rose by 56% to \u00a3100m. Mr Read admitted the US is still not contributing as much to the group's turnover as he would like - and that revenues had fallen by 4% compared with the previous year. \"We could certainly do better. We'll look to grow through a mixture of organic growth and acquisition.\" The performance in France was also below par, he said. </p> <p>Last year Logica took steps to fill what it saw as a strategic gap by buying German IT services company PDV for about \u00a3370m. Sector analysts believe that Logica might eventually seek to repeat the same process in the US, where it lacks critical mass.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The explosive growth in mobile telephone text messaging yesterday enabled the IT services group Logica to offset a disappointing performance in its US business and report better than expected sales and profit figures. Logica systems now handles the majority of the estimated 7bn text messages sent each month internationally. A technology shares sell-off following a big drop in the value of the Nasdaq index on Tuesday knocked the price of Logica stock sharply, and it closed down 141p at \u00a314.54p. Chief executive Martin Read was at a loss to explain the fall in the shares. \"When you've just delivered a pre-tax profits increase of 52% - a figure that is at the top end of most analysts' expectations - and your share price then falls 10%, it does seem a bit perverse,\" he said. \"Market conditions are generally good and we're looking forward to another year of strong performance. \"When you keep on delivering on the figures you just have to let the share price scenario take care of itself.\" Most analysts welcomed figures for the six months to December 31 that showed revenues up 25% to \u00a3505m, pre-tax profits up 52% at \u00a364.8m and a 33% dividend rise. Some observers do not believe text messaging annual growth rates of 70-90% can be sustained. Mr Read said: \"I simply don't agree with the people who say that the text messaging world is dead. The average person in Japan, where there are some of the most advanced mobile services, sends 300 text messages per year, but in Germany that figure is only 30 - and in the US it is even less.\" Mr Read predicted that even when the growth in text messaging does slow the big mobile network operators are likely to buy into more advanced messaging systems that will allow customers to send sound and images. \"The telcos have spent a fortune on their third-generation licences and they have to make them pay. \"They need to get as much volume through their networks as possible, and offer value-added services. We're what they need.\" A Deutsche Bank telecoms analyst, David Rees, agreed: \"For next-generation messaging platforms .. the group is uniquely positioned.\" Telecoms accounts for about half of Logica's annual revenues, but fees from the energy and utilities sectors rose by 56% to \u00a3100m. Mr Read admitted the US is still not contributing as much to the group's turnover as he would like - and that revenues had fallen by 4% compared with the previous year. \"We could certainly do better. We'll look to grow through a mixture of organic growth and acquisition.\" The performance in France was also below par, he said. Last year Logica took steps to fill what it saw as a strategic gap by buying German IT services company PDV for about \u00a3370m. Sector analysts believe that Logica might eventually seek to repeat the same process in the US, where it lacks critical mass.",

      "bodyText": "Britain has become notorious for having the highest teenage pregnancy rate in western Europe, twice that of Germany, three times higher than France and six times that of the Netherlands. While the rest of the continent has seen dramatic falls in teenage parenthood since the early 80s, the UK has long been the exception with a high rate which has remained static since 1977. Each year, around 56,000 babies are born to teenage mothers in Britain with nearly 8,000 conceived by girls under 16 and 2,200 by under 14-year-olds. The difficulty of solving the problem - described as \"unacceptably high\" by the employment minister, Margaret Hodge, last night - is compounded by there being no single identifiable reason for such high rates. Poverty, poor educational opportunities, being born to a teenage mother, and lack of work opportunities are all predicators, while rates of pregnancy have been found to be highest among the most vulnerable girls, those in deprived areas and those in care. One recent report, for the National Children's Bureau, showed a quarter of girls leave local authority care pregnant with a further quarter becoming pregnant within 24 months of leaving. Women in deprived areas are six times more likely to get pregnant by the age of 20 than those in the most affluent areas of Britain, according to the Family Policy Studies Centre. Figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed the number of pregnancies per 1,000 among under-18s in 1998 was highest in Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham (82.7), Manchester (68.3), Sandwell (67.8), and Sunderland (65.5). The areas shown to have the fewest teenage pregnancies were East Surrey (22.5), West Surrey (25.7) Kingston and Richmond (25.7), and Oxfordshire (29.9). While the government is committed to reducing the rate, there has been widespread concern that efforts to tackle the problem of teenage parenthood should not be reduced to moralising. A study by the Policy Studies Institute recently revealed that most teenage mothers do not plan their pregnancies. One in four of those interviewed said they had planned to have a baby and 40% were pleased to find they were pregnant. However, a quarter were shocked or surprised to find out they were pregnant and a further quarter were \"horrified\". Placing an emphasis on prevention has always been seen as an essential part of the strategy but sustained action to understand and address the needs of teenagers during and after pregnancy is now being recognised as a fundamental requirement. There is a strong link between teenage parenthood and an increased risk of poor health, economic and social outcomes for both mothers and children, according to several studies. Research cited by the Family Policy Studies Centre found that, compared to those who became first-time mothers in their 20s, teenage mothers were four times more likely to be living in social housing, over eight times as likely to have been lone parents, and almost three times more likely to lack qualifications, by the age of 33. In its report, published in June 1999, the government's social exclusion unit identified three possible reasons for Britain's higher teenage birth rates: low expectations in terms of job prospects, ignorance about contraception and the reality of motherhood, and mixed messages about sex. It concluded that these factors pointed to a \"single faultline\" in past attempts to tackle teenage pregnancy: \"neglect\". The report advocates a four-pronged action plan, placing greater emphasis on post-natal support for teenagers with a focus on returning to education or work. \"Teenagers who become parents should not lose out on opportunities for the future. \"Young parents should have the chance to complete their education,\" it says. Should the government's pilot scheme - which will be unveiled today, be extended -that ideal might become a reality.",

And now the hype is really beginning to pay off, The band created by ITV have clinched a deal for their first TV advertising campaign more than two weeks before their first single - which could, in theory, flop - is released. The National Dairy Council, which runs milk marketing campaigns on behalf Britain's farmers, has approached the famous fivesome to appear in its long-running \"white stuff\" campaign. A spokeswoman for the organisation said that the group - named Hearsay - had agreed in principle to appear. \"We approached their agent because we thought they'd be great in the ads - they said yes straight away,\" said the spokeswoman. \"The next thing is for us to come up with some appropriate storylines.\" Previous White Stuff commercials have used cartoon versions of various celebrities in humorous situations in which milk drinkers are portrayed as heroes. The ad agency behind the campaign is BMP DDB. Rolf Harris - with didgeridoo - was the latest star to appear in a milk advert. Chris Eubank, George Best and Prince Naseem have also allowed themselves to be transformed into cartoons for the campaign. The \u00a39m campaign uses the slogan: \"The White Stuff - are you made of it?\". The ads are intended to encourage adults to drink milk more frequently and to remind people that milk is a credible alternative to soft drinks.

High street banks charge between 1% and 2%, with minimum charges \u00a32.50 and \u00a34, but commission can be as high as 6%. You can save money by ordering them online. Nationwide charges no commission on online orders, but levies a delivery charge of \u00a33.50. Thomas Cook also accepts online orders. Bear in mind you will also be charged commission when you cash the cheques, although it is difficult to predict how much as it varies from country to country and outlet to outlet. In the UK, commission can be as high as 6%. Some overseas currency exchange outlets don't charge commission but offer a lower rate of exchange. Try and buy your cheques from a retailer who will cash any unused cheques free of charge. If you buy them from your bank, check if you can pay them into your account for free.

A cadet apparently picked up a device, possibly somewhere outside the centre in South Africa Road, White City, and was holding it when it went off at 7.10pm. A TA sergeant described the blast as sounding like \"two trains colliding\". The teenager was taken to the Westminster and Chelsea hospital suffering from serious injuries - including a severed left hand - as a team from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch were mobilised. Scotland Yard played down any involvement by terrorist organisations. But the level of police response indicated the concern regarding an attempt by republican groups to pursue a mainland campaign. The surrounding area was cordoned off and the nearby tube station closed, but residents were not evacuated. Last night detectives were still clearing up the debris inside the base - which is the headquarters of the Fourth Battalion Parachute Regiment 10 (London) company - and were trying to establish what kind of device was responsible. Police confirmed that no coded warning was received and an initial examination of the remains of the device by forensic experts suggested it was not the work of terrorists. Chief Superintendent Anthony Wills, officer in charge, said: \"Terrorism would not be our first line of inquiry.\" He said it was very unlikely the explosion was caused by munitions used by the TA. Mr Wills said the injured boy found the explosive device some way from the base, and carried it in. He added: \"He is very ill and is being looked after in hospital.\" It is understood that his left hand was blown off, and he suffered serious chest injuries. Last night his parents were at his bedside. Scotland Yard sources confirmed it was too early to say what had caused the explosion, but said there was nothing at this stage to suggest it was in any way linked to previous attacks in the capital by the splinter republican group, the Real IRA.",

      "body": "<p>In Washington today, Tony Blair will do what history tells him. It isn't possible to imagine him doing anything else. He will shake George Bush by the hand, and set about getting as close to him as a weekend in Camp David permits.</p> <p>It is rather a long weekend. There are people in the Foreign Office who wonder whether the two men will find enough to talk about, for Bush seems to be as pithy and ignorant as Bill Clinton was verbose and cornucopian in his interests. But Mr Blair is into promiscuous warmth. Jiang Zemin and Signor Berlusconi, I'm told, are two of the few national leaders who have failed to tap it.</p> <p>Besides, Mr Bush needs him. Pitifully unversed in Europe, the president will find in the Brit the most agreeable, reassuring representative of the English-speaking world which, aside from Mexico, is about all he has to hang on to. Both men see themselves as centrist politicians. Each will rush to make the best of what might once have seemed the ugly ideological allegiance of the other. I prophesy a new best friend for London, as Clinton, forgotten like Peter Mandelson, sweats out post-presidential ignominy in a lonely house in Chappaqua, NY.</p> <p>People who say this should not happen misunderstand the limits of the possible. Bush and Blair, after all, are at war together and alone, against Iraq. For Britain to have refused to go along with Washington's decision to upgrade the bombing attacks would have caused a political earthquake. We have no independence in the matter. We're locked in.</p> <p>Likewise, for Blair to make any kind of open trouble over national missile defence (NMD), the son of star wars, would cause a nervous breakdown in Washington and London. Already the terms of political trade in that argument are set. The burden on Britain is not to justify joining in, but to defend the near-inconceivable notion of declaring publicly against the scheme. Thus is national sovereignty qualified by the deposit of the ages.</p> <p>This accords, also, with the spirit of the new regime. Compensating for Bush's ignorance of the past are several men whose bewitchment by it is excessive. Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, out of the loop for 20 years, knows of little else. This means that the Brit of the moment - when Rumsfeld last took over the Pentagon it was Harold Wilson - has a special place, notably in the Nato scheme of things. Unique relationship unchanged. The last thing Mr Blair wants to do is disappoint him.</p> <p>Unfortunately, if he's to be true to the national interest, he won't find this easy to avoid. The British still pride themselves on being \"upstream\" in the American policy-making process. \"Our embassy is like another Washington agency, almost on equal terms with other parts of the administration in the policy debate,\" exulted a high official, talking to me recently. Quite unlike the French, he said, who stood outside and criticised, while usually going along with important policy in the end. But the inside track puts a tremendous burden on Blair to explain that things really have changed since the veterans riding herd on the ing\u00e9nu were last in the saddle.</p> <p>The hardest place for such a lesson may be Iraq. Being Washington's only ally in a policy that's as immoral as it is futile makes continuing support almost axiomatic. On the other hand, it's a patent disaster. We now learn that the policy of one part of our own government, to re-think sanctions, was blindly frustrated by another part, drawn into helpless support of Bush's determination to raise the ante by extending the bombing. Meanwhile, ministers like Robin Cook demean their name by putting it to propaganda about the bombing being in the interest of the Iraqi people.</p> <p>This is where the master-poodle relationship is most humiliatingly obvious: a bilateral commitment to an analysis that's contested by most of the intelligent world. But unless he's prepared for a major fracture, Blair has little leverage, even in private. It's like the old days, only worse. At least in sixties Vietnam we didn't send the bombers.</p> <p>The two other big military issues are rather different. Here things are not what they were when Rumsfeld and his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dick Cheney, now the vice-president, were first in charge. The change will be a theme of the Camp David meeting. Europe, Blair will explain, has developed. It is not just about Germany and France and Britain separately. The sum is greater than the parts. The parts are not willing to be picked off. But is Britain one of the parts? And can Bush be persuaded to understand this?</p> <p>On the European rapid reaction force, London sees its task as another round of persuasion. Blair has a big commitment to the force. It was, after all, mainly his creation. The Clinton people took time to accept that the potential conflicts with Nato were manageable. Their successors have to be taken through it all over again, and have already shown fewer signs of being helpful.</p> <p>When Cook was in Washington the other day, it was made plain to him that Cheney and Rumsfeld would not put pressure on Turkey, a Nato member wanting to get into the EU, to abandon her stroppy resistance to the RRF. That's a change from Clinton, who tried but failed to bring Turkey into line. It could signal hard times ahead.</p> <p>On national missile defence, Blair has gone out of his way to lower the temperature, saying he felt sure the problem could be defused. Bush's most emphatic commitment is to build NMD. It's the message every visitor has been given. Blair said he \"totally\" understood American concerns about the vulnerability of the homeland to attack from enemies that have gained from missile proliferation.</p> <p>Chancellor Schr\u00f6der has given similar indications. Europe as a whole, with the usual exception of France, has throttled back the horror it was expressing a year ago at the global instability NMD could create. Men of power recognise the facts of power, and adapt accordingly.</p> <p>But the case against NMD hasn't gone away. The doubts about it, both technical and geo-political, are fathomless, and mere American will is by no means enough to resolve them. The unilateralist assertion of the superpower is something her allies as much as her enemies have a vital interest in challenging. The justification for Blair's smiling public acquiescence can therefore only be the most rigorous private doubt-sharing.</p> <p>The hope from this get- together must be that the plaid-shirted bonhomie is misleading. The meeting should make plain the differences as much as the hoped-for intimacy. At bottom these differences are great and may be getting, of inexorable necessity, greater.</p> <p>Europe, which the US has always urged to take more of the burden, has its own belief in the rapid reaction force, and its own valid viewpoint on NMD. You can't get further upstream than being the first foreign visitor to Camp David. The news from Europe will come best from the special relation.</p>",

But Mr Blair is into promiscuous warmth. Jiang Zemin and Signor Berlusconi, I'm told, are two of the few national leaders who have failed to tap it. Besides, Mr Bush needs him. Pitifully unversed in Europe, the president will find in the Brit the most agreeable, reassuring representative of the English-speaking world which, aside from Mexico, is about all he has to hang on to. Both men see themselves as centrist politicians. Each will rush to make the best of what might once have seemed the ugly ideological allegiance of the other. I prophesy a new best friend for London, as Clinton, forgotten like Peter Mandelson, sweats out post-presidential ignominy in a lonely house in Chappaqua, NY. People who say this should not happen misunderstand the limits of the possible. Bush and Blair, after all, are at war together and alone, against Iraq. For Britain to have refused to go along with Washington's decision to upgrade the bombing attacks would have caused a political earthquake. We have no independence in the matter. We're locked in. Likewise, for Blair to make any kind of open trouble over national missile defence (NMD), the son of star wars, would cause a nervous breakdown in Washington and London. Already the terms of political trade in that argument are set. The burden on Britain is not to justify joining in, but to defend the near-inconceivable notion of declaring publicly against the scheme. Thus is national sovereignty qualified by the deposit of the ages. This accords, also, with the spirit of the new regime. Compensating for Bush's ignorance of the past are several men whose bewitchment by it is excessive. Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, out of the loop for 20 years, knows of little else. This means that the Brit of the moment - when Rumsfeld last took over the Pentagon it was Harold Wilson - has a special place, notably in the Nato scheme of things. Unique relationship unchanged. The last thing Mr Blair wants to do is disappoint him. Unfortunately, if he's to be true to the national interest, he won't find this easy to avoid. The British still pride themselves on being \"upstream\" in the American policy-making process. \"Our embassy is like another Washington agency, almost on equal terms with other parts of the administration in the policy debate,\" exulted a high official, talking to me recently. Quite unlike the French, he said, who stood outside and criticised, while usually going along with important policy in the end. But the inside track puts a tremendous burden on Blair to explain that things really have changed since the veterans riding herd on the ing\u00e9nu were last in the saddle. The hardest place for such a lesson may be Iraq. Being Washington's only ally in a policy that's as immoral as it is futile makes continuing support almost axiomatic. On the other hand, it's a patent disaster. We now learn that the policy of one part of our own government, to re-think sanctions, was blindly frustrated by another part, drawn into helpless support of Bush's determination to raise the ante by extending the bombing. Meanwhile, ministers like Robin Cook demean their name by putting it to propaganda about the bombing being in the interest of the Iraqi people. This is where the master-poodle relationship is most humiliatingly obvious: a bilateral commitment to an analysis that's contested by most of the intelligent world. But unless he's prepared for a major fracture, Blair has little leverage, even in private. It's like the old days, only worse. At least in sixties Vietnam we didn't send the bombers. The two other big military issues are rather different. Here things are not what they were when Rumsfeld and his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dick Cheney, now the vice-president, were first in charge. The change will be a theme of the Camp David meeting. Europe, Blair will explain, has developed. It is not just about Germany and France and Britain separately. The sum is greater than the parts. The parts are not willing to be picked off. But is Britain one of the parts? And can Bush be persuaded to understand this? On the European rapid reaction force, London sees its task as another round of persuasion. Blair has a big commitment to the force. It was, after all, mainly his creation. The Clinton people took time to accept that the potential conflicts with Nato were manageable. Their successors have to be taken through it all over again, and have already shown fewer signs of being helpful. When Cook was in Washington the other day, it was made plain to him that Cheney and Rumsfeld would not put pressure on Turkey, a Nato member wanting to get into the EU, to abandon her stroppy resistance to the RRF. That's a change from Clinton, who tried but failed to bring Turkey into line. It could signal hard times ahead. On national missile defence, Blair has gone out of his way to lower the temperature, saying he felt sure the problem could be defused. Bush's most emphatic commitment is to build NMD. It's the message every visitor has been given. Blair said he \"totally\" understood American concerns about the vulnerability of the homeland to attack from enemies that have gained from missile proliferation. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der has given similar indications. Europe as a whole, with the usual exception of France, has throttled back the horror it was expressing a year ago at the global instability NMD could create. Men of power recognise the facts of power, and adapt accordingly. But the case against NMD hasn't gone away. The doubts about it, both technical and geo-political, are fathomless, and mere American will is by no means enough to resolve them. The unilateralist assertion of the superpower is something her allies as much as her enemies have a vital interest in challenging. The justification for Blair's smiling public acquiescence can therefore only be the most rigorous private doubt-sharing. The hope from this get- together must be that the plaid-shirted bonhomie is misleading. The meeting should make plain the differences as much as the hoped-for intimacy. At bottom these differences are great and may be getting, of inexorable necessity, greater. Europe, which the US has always urged to take more of the burden, has its own belief in the rapid reaction force, and its own valid viewpoint on NMD. You can't get further upstream than being the first foreign visitor to Camp David. The news from Europe will come best from the special relation.",

      "bodyText": "An unrepentant lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, yesterday faced new Tory charges of arrogance when he refused to apologise for raising funds for Labour, insisting he had broken no current rules. During a tense 15 minute cross-examination, and standing the traditional two paces away from his seat on the woolsack, Lord Irvine told peers he had not undermined the integrity of his unique office. In his only concession to critics who claim he has compromised the political independence of his post, he said he would comply with any future rules restricting such fund-raising. He also pointed out that, from next month, a commissioner for judicial appointments will scrutinise the integrity of all appointments to the judiciary. Speaking for the first time since he came under attack, Lord Irvine told peers: \"I do not believe I have done anything wrong nor do I believe I have broken any current rules. If I did I would be the first to apologise. \"There is no real difference between party political campaigning and fundraising because I believe that fundraising is an inherent part of party political campaigning.\" Every minister from the prime minister downwards was involved in fund raising for the party, he said. Asked by Lord Strathclyde, shadow leader of the Lords, whether he would raise funds again, Lord Irvine replied that unless the rules were changed, he would consider doing it again. But he added that in practice he would first consider the furore which the issue had caused. He insisted he did not believe any lawyer attending the Labour party fundraising dinner which he hosted could have conceivably thought it could have \"bought\" them an advantage in gaining appointment. Lord Irvine's judgment was widely challenged after it emerged at the weekend that he sent a letter to Labour-sympathetic lawyers asking them to donate \u00a3200 at a party fund-raising dinner. Lord Irvine said it was misconceived to claim that the lord chancellor was not a party political post, pointing out that Tory predecessors, including Lord Hailsham, had spoken in election campaigns. The Labour headquarters at Millbank supplemented the claim by highlighting politically controversial interviews given in the 1992 election campaign by the last Conservative lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. Millbank also asserted that previous Tory lord chancellors had attended party fund raising events. However, the former Conser vative deputy prime minister and barrister, Lord Howe, said Lord Irvine had transformed the position by personally conducting fundraising. He said: \"None of Lord Irvine's predecessors acted as hosts of fund raising dinners attended solely by people over whose professional careers they have profound influence.\" Some Labour MPs and Liberal Democrats also asserted that no cabinet minister should ever seek political funds from anyone dependent on the same minister for their professional preferment. Bob Marshall-Andrews, a Labour backbencher and QC, said: \"The one thing no minister must conceivably do is to attempt to solicit funds for political purposes from those over whom he has influence, power or patronage.\" Since 26,000 annual public appointments are made by ministers, such a principle would effectively prevents ministers from any fund-raising activity. During question time in the Lords yesterday, the Liberal Democrat peer, Lord McNally, pressed Lord Irvine \"whether the role of lord chancellor is compatible with that of a party fundraiser?\" He added: \"There's a blurring by your behaviour of your responsibilities as a minister and your responsibilities as a politician.\" Later Lord Strathcyle said: \"The lord chancellor arrogantly failed to offer any kind of apology for action that has been universally condemned. He showed no humility, no sense of personal responsibility or any shred of concern for the storm of criticism\". Lord Irvine did not rule out the Labour policy of a judicial appointments commission, so handing the appointment of judges to an independent body. He said: \"It is a very controversial proposition, and you know well that there are many who are really opposed to that proposition because of the dangers which it is said to pose to appointments on merit only, as distinct from appointments which make compromises.\"",

So could the desperados seeking to defend organic farmers by decontaminating fields of genetically modified maize. Campaigners subjecting a corporation to a fax blockade become terrorists by dint of interfering with an electronic system. Indeed, by writing articles in support of such actions, I could be deemed to be \"promoting and encouraging\" them. Which makes me a terrorist and you, if you were foolish enough to copy my articles and send them to your friends, party to my crime. I don't believe the government will start making use of these new measures right away: after all, as Mr Blair lamented on Sunday, \"Jerusalem is not built overnight\". But they can now be deployed whenever progress demands. Then, unmolested by dangerous lunatics armed with banners and custard pies, the government will be free to advance world peace by bombing Baghdad to its heart's content. g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Britain has become notorious for having the highest teenage pregnancy rate in western Europe, twice that of Germany, three times higher than France and six times that of the Netherlands. While the rest of the continent has seen dramatic falls in teenage parenthood since the early 80s, the UK has long been the exception with a high rate which has remained static since 1977. Each year, around 56,000 babies are born to teenage mothers in Britain with nearly 8,000 conceived by girls under 16 and 2,200 by under 14-year-olds. The difficulty of solving the problem - described as \"unacceptably high\" by the employment minister, Margaret Hodge, last night - is compounded by there being no single identifiable reason for such high rates. Poverty, poor educational opportunities, being born to a teenage mother, and lack of work opportunities are all predicators, while rates of pregnancy have been found to be highest among the most vulnerable girls, those in deprived areas and those in care. One recent report, for the National Children's Bureau, showed a quarter of girls leave local authority care pregnant with a further quarter becoming pregnant within 24 months of leaving. Women in deprived areas are six times more likely to get pregnant by the age of 20 than those in the most affluent areas of Britain, according to the Family Policy Studies Centre. Figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed the number of pregnancies per 1,000 among under-18s in 1998 was highest in Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham (82.7), Manchester (68.3), Sandwell (67.8), and Sunderland (65.5). The areas shown to have the fewest teenage pregnancies were East Surrey (22.5), West Surrey (25.7) Kingston and Richmond (25.7), and Oxfordshire (29.9). While the government is committed to reducing the rate, there has been widespread concern that efforts to tackle the problem of teenage parenthood should not be reduced to moralising. A study by the Policy Studies Institute recently revealed that most teenage mothers do not plan their pregnancies. One in four of those interviewed said they had planned to have a baby and 40% were pleased to find they were pregnant. However, a quarter were shocked or surprised to find out they were pregnant and a further quarter were \"horrified\". Placing an emphasis on prevention has always been seen as an essential part of the strategy but sustained action to understand and address the needs of teenagers during and after pregnancy is now being recognised as a fundamental requirement. There is a strong link between teenage parenthood and an increased risk of poor health, economic and social outcomes for both mothers and children, according to several studies. Research cited by the Family Policy Studies Centre found that, compared to those who became first-time mothers in their 20s, teenage mothers were four times more likely to be living in social housing, over eight times as likely to have been lone parents, and almost three times more likely to lack qualifications, by the age of 33. In its report, published in June 1999, the government's social exclusion unit identified three possible reasons for Britain's higher teenage birth rates: low expectations in terms of job prospects, ignorance about contraception and the reality of motherhood, and mixed messages about sex. It concluded that these factors pointed to a \"single faultline\" in past attempts to tackle teenage pregnancy: \"neglect\". The report advocates a four-pronged action plan, placing greater emphasis on post-natal support for teenagers with a focus on returning to education or work. \"Teenagers who become parents should not lose out on opportunities for the future. \"Young parents should have the chance to complete their education,\" it says. Should the government's pilot scheme - which will be unveiled today, be extended -that ideal might become a reality.",

Dempster on driving charge The Daily Mail columnist Nigel Dempster appeared at Richmond magistrates court, south-west London, yesterday, charged with drink-driving, following an accident at Ham Common, Surrey, near his home.

Dome sale items go on display More than 17,000 items from the Millennium Dome will go on public display today prior to an auction at the south London site next week.

Scotland Yard was alerted to the blast by BBC staff who heard a loud bang near Broadcasting House at 7.10pm. The explosion happened in Shepherds Bush, near the QPR football ground. At least one man was injured - Scotland Yard said his condition was not thought to be life threatening. A team from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch were last night shifting through debris to try to establish whether the device was similar to those used by dissident republicans in previous attacks. Scotland Yard and the security services have been expecting a further strike from republicans opposed to the peace process in Northern Ireland. It was feared that dissidents would launch a Christmas bombing campaign and when this did not materialise senior officers suspected another attack must be imminent. It is thought the dissidents have neither the will nor the capability to detonate a Canary Wharf or Omagh-style bomb, preferring instead to use smaller devices targeted to cause maximum disruption with the minimum risk of casualties. Scotland Yard has been on its second highest state of alert since last autumn in expectation of a further strike in the capital.",

Lawyers for Philip Karam, a former trader claiming racial discrimination by the bank, inadvertently named \"Mr Newson\" as a person who used the drug. The claim emerged because CSFB is attempting to strike out Mr Karam's case, claiming that the former trader had withdrawn a series of new allegations - including the one concerning cocaine abuse - at the last minute. Lawyers acting for CSFB branded the accusations of cocaine abuse as \"scandalous and salacious\", designed to cause embarrassment and damage to the bank. Andrew Hochhauser QC, for the bank told the hearing at Stratford, east London, that Mr Karam and his legal advisers had sent anonymous documents to senior bank officials and briefed newspapers, an abuse of process. \"That publicity has caused considerable distress to CSFB and certain of its employees who were subject to the new allegations.\" Judith Reed, a lawyer at CSFB, told the tribunal the bank made a \"very generous settlement offer\" to Mr Karam which had been rejected. In cross-examination, Ms Reed said Mr Karam closely followed the results of employment tribunals and had seen payouts of \u00a32m. Mr Karam, 32, of south London, started as a desk assistant at the bank in June 1998 but claims he was doing the work of a junior trader and earned a salary, with bonuses, of \u00a344,000. CSFB insists he did not trade and claims internal records showing his name listed under the heading \"trader\" are misleading. John Hendy, QC, for Karam, said City regulations insist only the person who carried out a trade can fill in this information. The case continues today.",

It was the greatest number ever created at one time, and takes the college of cardinals, which will one day elect a new pope, to record levels. There are now 184 cardinals, 135 of whom are under age 80 and thus at present entitled to vote at any conclave. Pope John Paul II, 81 in May and the fifth longest reigning pontiff, told the new cardinals in their scarlet vestments: \"Is that colour not perhaps a symbol of passionate love for Christ? \"Do we not see indicated in that bright red the burning fire of love for the Church which should nourish in you the willingness, if necessary, to give the supreme witness of blood?\" Each man knelt to receive his scarlet zucchetta, or skull-cap, and four-cornered biretta. The traditional, broad-brimmed and betasselled cardinal's hat is no longer presented. John Paul has created more cardinals in his 23 years than any predecessor. All but 10 of the voting cardinals owe their preferment to him - a situation thought likely to increase the chance of his successor also being theologically conservative. The 44 come from 27 countries, from Vietnam to Peru. The elevation of the Archbishop of Dublin, Desmond Connell, as well as the Archbishop of Westminster gives Britain and Ireland four cardinals. For the first time a majority of cardinals is non European, increasing the chance of the next pope being for the first time being one of their number; Latin America, with 40% of the world's 1bn Catholics, has 33 cardinals.

The fighting began early on Sunday morning when locals attacked a migrant housing estate. The Madurese responded the following day and the situation deteriorated rapidly. The town's police chief, assistant-commander Benjamin Selawa, said that at least 57 houses in and around the town had been destroyed or burned and that a couple of thousand people had taken refuge at police stations, local government offices or in the council building. \"The town centre is calm now, but that is probably because most people have left,\" he said. \"Things are still tense on the edge of town as that's where we're finding most of the bodies.\" Neither the doctor nor the police chief would say which ethnic group had suffered more casualties. \"Let's just say it is balanced,\" Commander Selawa said. \"We don't want to inflame a situation that is being driven by revenge.\" He said the area's population was fairly evenly balanced between locals and migrants.

Magistrates who have grown old hunting Bernardo Provenzano punched the air in victory yesterday after a midnight raid netted his lieutenant, Vincenzo Virga, one of the 10 most wanted criminals in Italy, in a cottage on the outskirts of Trapani, on western tip of Sicily. Masked officers who burst into the cottage in Trapani's Fulgatore district yesterday found Virga, 64, surrounded by documents and \u00a35,600 in cash as he watched a documentary about the 1992 mafia assassinations of two judges. A fugitive for more than six years, he looked astonished but offered no resistance. He faces life imprisonment for murdering a judge, a journalist and a prison guard who refused to help a jailed mafioso. A genius for figures and persuasion propelled the former peasant to the mafia's top ranks and a job ensuring - through bribes and intimidation - public works contracts were awarded to mafia companies. \"He is a magician in piloting contracts. We have caught the business brain of Bernardo Provenzano,\" said police chief Giuseppe Linares. Under Virga's direction, the apparently sleepy, non-descript town of Trapani, with more banks than Italian cities five times its size, became a magnet for hundreds of millions of pounds of mafia revenue, which was recycled by investing in land developments and waste disposal. Before going on the run in 1994, Virga mixed with politicians, financiers and artists, some of whom may be incriminated by documents in his possession. Police believe the real damage to Provenzano is the loss of his liaison with a new generation of mobsters who know him only as a ghost, flitting from safe houses to mountain shacks. He dares not use a phone in case it is bugged and avoids personal contact for fear of people being followed. Letters intercepted from Provenzano's wife, brother and two grown-up sons last month, referred to winter clothing, suggesting he was in the hills. His wife, Saveria, advised him to wash his socks in cold water. Her last known meeting with him was nine years ago. The last known photograph of Provenzano, who was convicted in his absence for the 1992 murder of a judge, was taken in 1959 and shows a heavy-set young man with brilliantined hair, a grave expression and wearing a suit. He disappeared in 1963 and apart from a few trips abroad is believed to have remained in Sicily. Nicknamed \"the Tractor\" for mowing down his opponents, he was mocked by one godfather for shooting like an angel but having the brains of a chicken. The godfather was wrong. Provenzano's extraordinary success in eluding capture enabled him to take command of the mafia in 1993. Uncle Binu, as he is known, steered the mob away from blowing up judges and shooting police officers towards a quieter, slyer existence of kickbacks and racketeering. It emerged yesterday that Provenzano came within yards of being cornered last month when police caught another mafia lieutenant in a cottage outside Palermo. Provenzano was probably in a nearby house. A leaked letter from a carabinieri general accused police of blundering in an effort to steal glory from his rival paramilitary force.

      "bodyText": "A French mercenary who claims to have worked as a hired assassin for the Spanish government has threatened to reveal the full workings of the dirty war launched against Basque separatists in the 1980s. Jean Philippe Labade was questioned at a court in Madrid this week by the investigating magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, after claiming that he was paid by Spanish anti-terrorist police to kill two Basque separatists living in France. His evidence could reveal the facts behind a campaign of bombing, shooting and kidnapping carried out by the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Group (GAL) which claimed 23 victims in the 1980s. It could also further damage the reputation of the former Socialist prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, whose 13 years in government ended under a cloud of corruption and dirty-war scandals at the interior ministry. Judge Garzon also called several former senior anti-terrorist officials to his court on Tuesday to explain a series of meetings they had with Labade at a prominent hotel in Madrid. The former French mercenary has said he was handed a briefcase full of Fr500 notes. Among those who appeared in court were Francisco Alvarez, the former head of the Spanish police's anti-terrorist unit, and the former chief of police in Bilbao, Miguel Planchuelo. Labade was a key member of GAL who met Spanish police and hired other gunmen for a campaign against Basque separatists. At the time, the armed Basque separatist group, Eta, and other terrorist groups posed a huge problem for the Socialist government, killing up to 120 people a year. Eta's leadership was, and still is, based in south-west France. GAL's victims included some well-known Eta members, but it also killed innocent by standers, including Spanish Basques. Labade has been held in a Spanish prison for the past six months awaiting extradition to France, where he will serve a life sentence for killing the Eta leader Tomas Perez Revilla in Biarritz in 1984. Labade, whose written confessions to Judge Garzon have been leaked to Spanish newspapers, claims that the Perez Revilla killing was part of a campaign he was hired to carry out by the anti-terrorist officials he met in Madrid. He has implicated those officials in another killing in 1984, that of the Basque separatist Javier Perez de Arenaza. Labade is known to have hired a team Portuguese mercenaries to help carry out attacks on supposed Eta members living in south-west France. Judge Garzon, who campaigned to extradite Chile's General Augusto Pinochet, has said he is considering bringing charges of murder or conspiracy to murder against some of the anti-terrorist officials. Most of those officials have spent time in jail for their involvement in the two-week kidnapping of a furniture salesman, Segundo Marey, who was mistaken for an Eta leader. Court sources said yesterday that some members of the anti-terrorist team had admitted paying Labade money, but said that they thought he was just another informer. Judge Garzon was expected to question Labade about two of GAL's most indiscriminate attacks: its bombings of the Batzoki bar in Hendaye and of the Consolation bar in Saint Jean de Luz, where 12 people were injured. GAL's victims hope Judge Garzon will help prove that it operated as a state-funded terrorist group, thus making them eligible for compensation from the Spanish government. Some court officials claimed this week that Labade had only decided to talk to Judge Garzon to delay his extradition to France.",

The increase coincided with a 16% fall in violence against women in the home reported by the British Crime Survey between 1995 to 1997. A significant rise in the number suffering injury from violence in public, especially a 7% increase among those in their 30s and 40s, was reported over three years by accident and emergency departments selected at random by doctors at the University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff. The Cardiff researchers suggest, in the latest edition of Emergency Medicine Journal, that their figures are a more reliable indicator of trends than either police investigation and prosecution records or other surveys because they reflect the actual treatment of patients, shortly after injury and when attacks are fresh in the minds of both victims and those who accompany them to casualty. They say a previous study in just one area had found that rates of injury from attacks in pubs and on the street were higher than those from domestic violence. Violent offences are often not reported to authorities because of difficulties in identifying attackers, or a continuing relationship with them, fear of reprisals or antipathy towards the police. The researchers also note few facilities or sometimes little encouragement to do so in the accident and emergency departments themselves.

However, the idea of endorsing a medium which was then more than 40% pure porn, or Christians logging on to wor ship together without the crucial act of breaking bread, was initially met with a disdain. \"Everyone was aware of it three or four years ago even if they were slow to get plugged in.\" says Bishop Konstant of Leeds, instrumental in setting up the Church's national website and often credited as Britain's most wired bish. \"But all the dioceses are now online, which wouldn't have been expected two years ago, even if most are using it only for email,\" he says. The change in recent attitudes has been stark, with the Vatican now producing of the most visited non-commercial sites on the web at www.vatican.va and a growing realisation that if anyone truly needs a Mission, the internet would be right up there with Goths and Americans. \"Just because a certain percentage of the web is used in a seedy way, doesn't mean it should be avoided, \" says Bishop Konstant. \"The written word is extraordinarily valuable, and the more one uses it for higher purposes, the lower that proportion of pornography becomes. I think the appointment of a patron saint would send some very important signals.\"",

Veterans of the Australian market, the company originally moved into IT education when it noticed rising public demand for its own internal training. </p> <p> In the UK market, if you are a professional and are considering a move into IT, then you are aligned with Spherion's students. Typical Spherion students are in their 30s, want to change career and are pressed for time.</p> <p> They are motivated professionals who come with clear aims and want to learn technical skills - from the most basic up to complex programming. Rigid campus learning this is not: full-time students study for 25 hours a week when it suits them. They can book places at the Mayfair teaching center and log into an intranet. And unlike education on campus, students start and complete courses at all times of the year, free from the term system. </p> <p> Dzelde explains learning with Spherion as more like the work place than school, getting help when needed. \"People coming to us from the workforce, find it easy to adapt. People straight from other educational backgrounds find it helps them to get ready for the workforce. Some people do need the 'hand-holding' classroom process, but most of our students don't have time for that - they're too anxious to get out there,\" she insists. </p> <p> \"Out there\" seems the place to be, given the rewards. \"In the UK, our graduates see a 25% increase in their salaries between their entry and rentering their profession when they finish their course,\" says Dzelde, having recently surveyed IT training's effect on salaries. So does Spherion's success mean Southampton, Sheffield or Stamford university's demise? Is online and IT learning the death knell for the classroom? At the Learning Technologies Conference, the question was: \"Is the classroom dead?\" </p> <p> \"The general consensus is that it isn't, it can't be -because people need that social interaction - but that there are lots of things you just don't need to do in a classroom' insists Dzelde. \"In my experience, universities tend to have their own agenda,\" insists Alan Bullock of Forbes IT. Another player in this strong market, the company teaches software development to selected applicants. Bullock maintains the private sector has an advantage which makes them \"less theory-based, more innovative and more tailored towards the client.\" Forbes then uses its recruitment arm for its new graduates, provided they attain strong level of both technical and personal skills.</p> <p> And while Forbes is planning online teaching by the end of the year, it is this personal skills element, so prized by employers, that ensures not all the courses can be we web-based. While IT as a whole simmers, no part of it is burning brighter than the market for Java. Java servlets, swing, Java server pages - whether this means to you '\"server side Java\" or just junk jargon, it is the employment skill to have. </p> <p> \"The Java market is very hot at the moment. It is probably one of the most sought-after, in-demand skills by both employers who want it and people who want to be trained in it,\" explains Paul Rosenthal of Java specialists Fastrack IT. </p> <p> High demand for skills? You would have thought the market would be rejoicing. But things are not that simple. While basic Java training companies are easy to find, move to the top end of this complex language, and the number of specialists drop off rapidly. \"One of the biggest problems the Java industry faces is the sheer number of people purporting to know the language.</p> <p> Anyone who is recruiting runs the risk of taking someone who claims to know it but doesn't,\" says Rosenthal. And while salaries have rocketed, many employees with superficial Java skills are not finding employment rapidly. But with every business adopting an e-commerce strategy, supply is outstripping demand. </p> <p> The steady supply from Fastrack's specialist course remains employer-friendly because of its apprentice system. Students spend six months working on the extranet, an innovative extension of the Fastrack website that allows its customers to log into the company's internal system and monitor service progress. The transparency builds inter-corporate trust while the students acquire workplace skills that employers snap up. </p> <p>\"It is what we call a virtuous circle,\" says Rosenthal. Finally, at the other end of the market, there is Direct Computer Training [DTC]. While it offers professional courses for sale, one side of this company is devoted to training the unemployed in IT. Funded by the government's Focus Training and Enterprise Council, they teach the full range of skills - from IT to interview techniques - to ensure students do not just pick up knowledge but actually find jobs in the workplace. </p> <p> \"We are acutely aware it is not about computers, it is about people. We give students the skills they need to achieve their aims,\" explains Graham O'Connor, from the government side of the DCT. Nida Ufmani, the training co-ordinator for the professional side of the business seems to echo his hands-on approach: \"I have a degree. I could stick as many letters next to my name but it doesn't mean that much in terms of hands-on experience.\" Here's to IT experience for all, then.</p>",

And ironically, during the week in which San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court issued a judgment against Napster (see opposite page) that will effectively shut it down, the same city hosted an energetic three-day conference on P2P sponsored by the technology publisher O'Reilly and Associates. </p> <p>The oversubscribed conference - attended by a thousand P2P fans, start-ups, big businesses scouting for acquisitions, venture capitalists and overflowing with some of technology's best-known names (including Young) - underlined that whatever the courts may do, the world is going to have to reckon with P2P. </p> <p>\"What Napster showed us is the shape of the next-generation internet,\" said publisher and conference organiser Tim O'Reilly. </p> <p>Why is P2P seen by its proponents as revolutionary? Since the arrival of the web, the PC has been little more than a mute appendage, a passive receiver of digital content stored in big, centralised computers. Even email is not a direct link to another individual, but requires the sender to go through a centralised digital post office: the sender asks a server to take the message and ship it over the network, then the recipient asks a server to deliver it. But P2P makes every computer a broadcaster of content as well as a receiver, an autonomous source of whatever information and resources the computer user cares to share. </p> <p>In the early 90s, PCs were \"really nothing more than a life support system for a browser\", said writer and analyst Clay Shirky at the conference. While PCs now often have the power of yesterday's big workstations, they still constitute a \"veil of second class connectivity\". </p> <p>But the veil hides a wealth of real computing resources that P2P can place at the disposal of the PC user. Together, the computers currently on the net represent at least 10 billion megahertz of power and 10,000 terabytes of storage, Shirky said. He sees P2P as socially \"communitarian\" - literally giving power to the people - and asks, \"How far can we go towards distributing power to the edges of the network?\" </p> <p>Many argue that P2P is not a distortion of how the net should operate, but a vision of the net as its creators originally intended. </p> <p>With P2P \"the internet is being used in the ways that it was intended,\" argued conference speaker Ian Clarke, inventor of the P2P software program Freenet, which links users into a giant, anonymous web. \"With peer-to-peer, we now have a phrase to describe something that [the internet pioneers] took for granted.\" </p> <p> Whatever the net's originators intended, peer-to-peer applications have already caught both the public's and the business world's eyes, in most cases without their knowing it. For example, instant messaging is considered the first real peer-to-peer application, because it opens and holds a direct link to an individual user, unlike email. Napster has spawned several similar programs such as Gnutella and Freenet, which also allow users to directly exchange files or chat. </p> <p>More exotically, SETI@home, the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence organisation, has pooled the unused processor power of home computers through a screensaver program that crunches through radio data received from space. Some companies, including the P2P start-up Entropia and the veteran internet service provider Juno believe they can sell such \"spare\" processor time from home users to corporates that need supercomputing power on a budget. </p> <p>Other young companies attending the conference believe they can bring P2P to the workplace with applications that allow groups to collaborate on projects with realtime updates, or form online meeting groups or develop software using chat, or pool the processing power of separate PCs on company networks. And even some of the technology world's biggest players have rowed in behind P2P. Chief Sun scientist Bill Joy announced that Sun would introduce a P2P development platform called JXTA (for juxtaposition). Intel and Microsoft have also announced they will create an open source library for creating P2P applications. </p> <p>But for P2P to penetrate the business world developers will need to understand the corporate mindset, cautioned Ray Ozzie, founder of another P2P pioneer, Groove Networks. The corporate world fears that P2P applications \"have no respect for intellec tual property\", are \"bandwidth hogs\" and could allow viruses to pass corporate firewalls. Businesses must believe P2P programs will bring no harm and either \"alleviate pain\" or provide an opportunity or competitive edge, he said. </p> <p>But venture capitalist Bill Burnham raised doubts by bringing up the terms pen-based computing, push technology and business to business exchanges. \"Those technologies sold themselves too soon; they couldn't live up to the hype. Will P2P be the same?\" he asked Ozzie and a set of P2P panellists. </p> <p>\"It is much too early to be worrying about which business models will succeed because we are still discovering which technological models will succeed,\" said Shirky. </p> <p>However, some fear that neither the technological nor business models for P2P will find any breathing space, for reasons illustrated by Napster's woes in a nearby San Francisco courtroom. </p> <p>\"The courts are ratifying the ability of [the entertainment industry] to regulate cyberspace now, before we even know what it's going to look like,\" lamented Lawrence Lessig, an internet commen tator and Stanford law professor, in a speech that voiced strong support for Napster. \"We need the period of experimentation. Give me 10 years before we get to that conclusion, but don't restrict the innovation now.\" </p> <p>Others are more optimistic. Shirky believes computer users will demonstrate an online form of mass civil disobedience and continue to use P2P programs to share files, but within limits. \"We will find equilibrium,\" he said. \"A set of limits in which people can live, while respecting content, is coming.\" </p> <p>Shirky believes P2P's real promise is the creation of a single, global made out of hundreds of millions of terminals linked over the internet. \"Thomas Watson [the founder of IBM] predicted that the world would not ever need more than five computers,\" said Shirky. \"We now know he overestimated that by four.\" </p> <p> <strong> What is P2P?</strong><br> About the only agreed definition of P2P is that it means peer to peer.

And it is scaring many of the powers that be, from governments to law enforcement to groups concerned with protecting copyright material.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Hard on the heels of an exclusive report by my colleague Keith Harper that Railtrack is teetering on bankruptcy as a result of its repair bills comes a fascinating explanation as to why cash is so tight. A labourer working on repairing the lines for Railtrack claims to be paid a small matter of \u00a3650 a day, seven days a week - a total of \u00a34,550. Not bad for a week's work, even if it does mean long and unsocial hours without a day off. Further, the labourer claimed to have enough railway work at that level for the next nine months (that would come to more than \u00a3177,000 without a day off, which seems unlikely.) </p> <p>Alas, when we ring Railtrack to ask if this is true, they aren't much help. \"You'll have to speak to the contractors directly, we don't actually pay anyone,\" said Laura Conrad, a Railtrack press officer. \"Our contracts are for fixed sums and it's up to the contractors how much they pay their staff.\" Quite. I shall try ringing around the contractors tomorrow. But in the meantime anyone with details of how much contractors are paying, why not get in touch? </p> <p>\u0095 Speaking of big pay packets, some fascinating data on the City from Reuters' annual survey of analysts. Some 60% of analysts get paid more than \u00a3100,000 a year and another 30% are forced to get by on between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000. On the other hand, 60% work between 60 and 80 hours a week. But there are still no signs that the City is any less of a \"men only\" club: a mere 90% of analysts are men. </p> <p>\u0095 Yesterday I mentioned the unusual conditions of service imposed by cable company NTL - specifically that its customers are barred from using the internet for more than 24 hours in a single day. A rather futile restriction, one might think. Except that, as switched-on reader Andy Taylor asks: \"What do they do on that day in the autumn when the clocks go back: it has 25 hours?\" An excellent point. On his web page, Andy lists his hobbies as trams and collecting Austrian stamps. </p> <p>\u0095 \"Guarantees that are managed implicitly are managed through the asset mix of the asset share account and the bonus policy of the class of business\" - an extract from page 24, paragraph 7.4.7.4, of Transparent With-Profits, published yesterday, in an attempt to improve personal pensions transparency. </p> <p>\u0095 Readers might have received copies of an email doing the rounds, detailing correspondence between Jonah Peretti and Nike, the one-time exploitative track shoe manufacturer.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Hard on the heels of an exclusive report by my colleague Keith Harper that Railtrack is teetering on bankruptcy as a result of its repair bills comes a fascinating explanation as to why cash is so tight. A labourer working on repairing the lines for Railtrack claims to be paid a small matter of \u00a3650 a day, seven days a week - a total of \u00a34,550. Not bad for a week's work, even if it does mean long and unsocial hours without a day off. Further, the labourer claimed to have enough railway work at that level for the next nine months (that would come to more than \u00a3177,000 without a day off, which seems unlikely.) Alas, when we ring Railtrack to ask if this is true, they aren't much help. \"You'll have to speak to the contractors directly, we don't actually pay anyone,\" said Laura Conrad, a Railtrack press officer. \"Our contracts are for fixed sums and it's up to the contractors how much they pay their staff.\" Quite. I shall try ringing around the contractors tomorrow. But in the meantime anyone with details of how much contractors are paying, why not get in touch? \u0095 Speaking of big pay packets, some fascinating data on the City from Reuters' annual survey of analysts. Some 60% of analysts get paid more than \u00a3100,000 a year and another 30% are forced to get by on between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000. On the other hand, 60% work between 60 and 80 hours a week. But there are still no signs that the City is any less of a \"men only\" club: a mere 90% of analysts are men. \u0095 Yesterday I mentioned the unusual conditions of service imposed by cable company NTL - specifically that its customers are barred from using the internet for more than 24 hours in a single day. A rather futile restriction, one might think. Except that, as switched-on reader Andy Taylor asks: \"What do they do on that day in the autumn when the clocks go back: it has 25 hours?\" An excellent point. On his web page, Andy lists his hobbies as trams and collecting Austrian stamps. \u0095 \"Guarantees that are managed implicitly are managed through the asset mix of the asset share account and the bonus policy of the class of business\" - an extract from page 24, paragraph 7.4.7.4, of Transparent With-Profits, published yesterday, in an attempt to improve personal pensions transparency. \u0095 Readers might have received copies of an email doing the rounds, detailing correspondence between Jonah Peretti and Nike, the one-time exploitative track shoe manufacturer. In a uncomfortable reminder of the recent past, Mr Peretti (a post-graduate student at MIT in Boston) ordered a pair of custom-made Nike trainers with the word \"Sweatshop\" embroidered on them, but Nike refused, on the grounds that the word was \"offensive slang\". After some discussion the dialogue ends with Mr Peretti asking instead for a photograph of the Vietnamese girl who made the shoes. The email has now circulated around the world, as these things do, and Jonah has received thousands of emails from fans but not a word of criticism until a few days ago. A mysterious email turned up attacking Jonah's decision to go public. But a bit of detective work showed the email came from someone inside Nike. Confronted with this detail, the mystery critic replied: \"Who cares if I work for Nike!\" \u0095 Property news: Countryside Properties of Vancouver, Canada, is giving away free \"move-in\" packs to people buying a house through them.

The answer: \"Tell him about your plans.\" The physicist Niels Bohr put it more scientifically: \"Prediction is very difficult,\" he wrote, \"especially about the future.\" </p> <p>These days, however, if it is the future you seek, you can find a host of helping hands online. The Chinese have been using divination tools for three millennia, so a good place to start is www.myfortune 21.com, \"an amalgamation of the wonders of Oriental intelligence and modern scientific technology\". Here you can discover your fortune through traditional games such as Shake the Tortoise, or input the date and time of your birth to discover the \"weight\" of your life. </p> <p> Apparently, mine weighs 5.6kg, guaranteeing \"great success and good fortune\". At <a href=\"http://www.aquarianage.org/china/diary\" target=\"_new\">www.aquarianage.org/china/diary</a>, Ping Wu's Taoist Diary uses Chinese astrology to predict world events. His millennium prediction is for a unified Europe, releasing \"unbelievable power\" - but also war and dark years until 2003.</p> <p> You might need a cup of tea after that. Willa G Cline used to offer to drink a cup then give a real tea-leaf reading over the web; it must have been oversubscribed as the service has now been automated <a href=\"http://www.willa.com/tealeaves/\" target=\"_new\">www.willa.com/tealeaves/</a>. </p> <p>There is also a QuickTime tea-cup: give it a stir at <a href=\"http://www.worldtea.net\" target=\"_new\">www.worldtea.net</a>. Once you have your strength back and feel up to a stronger brew, try www.facade.com. Methods on offer here include Bibliomancy, where a random phrase is plucked from the King James Bible; a variety of Runes (will Microsoft always dominate the desktop? The Gold Runes seem to think so); I-Ching; and even a lawyers' page for instant legal divination. I asked: \"How is my mortgage coming along?\" and was told, \"We have sent the forms which seem right for you.\" Creepy. </p> <p> Facade treads a nice line between the occult and self-satire: the biorhythms section produces accurate charts, but if you leave the dates blank you get the life-rhythms of Sandra Bullock. At least, I hope that's satire. Perhaps the most well-known divination tool is the Tarot deck. The Tarot emerged from traditional playing cards in the 16th century, and has since burgeoned into hundreds of styles. <a href=\"http://www.facade.com/tarot\" target=\"_new\">Facade</a> offers comprehensive Tarot readings from eight classic decks. </p> <p>If the concerns of 500 years ago seem outdated, <a href=\"http://www.svtarot.com\" target=\"_new\">Silicon Valley Tarot</a> promises fortune-telling cards for the information age. (\"Cheaper than a consultant. Same results.\") The cards are tailored to fit the anxieties of our time: The Layoff replaces Death; Strength has become Double Latte. I asked: \"Should we ever buy tech stock again?\" and got The Eight of Cubicles: \"Time for a sabbatical.\" We knew that much already.</p> <p>Other modern divination methods include <a href=\"http://www.priven.sf.ca.us/fortell.html\" target=\"_new\">Aaron's Fortune Telling Program</a>, which claims to \"read the psychic impression you have made on your computer over the years.\" The fortune delivered is strangely specific - apparently, I'll be \"caught at the US/Canada border.\"</p> <p> There are plenty of other offbeat oracles out there: you can ask a <a href=\"http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/paulfitz/plank/advice.html\" target=\"_new\">Klingon</a>); <a href=\"http://members.aol.com/jasonandelvis/elvisstash/askelvis.html\" target=\"_new\">Elvis the dog</a>; even the <a href=\"http://www.uidaho.edu/~bokm9606/magic/magict.htm\" target=\"_new\">A-Team's Mr T</a>, who, true to form, says \"No, sucka!\" or \"Quit that jibber- jabber!\" to just about everything. The accuracy of predictions about the future is debatable.</p> <p> Still, there is no doubt that the more genuine divination methods such as the Tarot and the I-Ching help focus the mind on troublesome issues, and the accompanying texts are age-old stores of human wisdom. Plus, making predictions is fun. So what does the new millennium hold for mankind? Will George \"Dubya\" Bush last more than a term? Mr T says: \"No, sucka!\" </p> <p>Will 3G mobile live up to its hype - and its hyped licence costs? The <a href=\"http://www.whirl-i-gig.com/madame.html\" target=\"_new\">Coney Island Fairground Madame</a> says: \"Don't travel.\" Sounds like a no. </p> <p> Will the world's oil reserves be replaced by alternative energy sources in time to save civilisation? A single card from Facade's St Petersburg Tarot (the Star) indicates \"Hope, Faith, Inspiration. Bright prospects.\" Phew. We will leave the last word to my favourite divination method, the <a href=\"http://www.facade.com/yesno\" target=\"_new\">Yes/No floaty pen</a>. </p> <p>\"Are monkeys following me?\" Yes, the pen says, but I knew that already. How about the one answer I have always wanted? \"Oh, all-wise floaty pen, in this next millennium, will the internet blossom into an all-powerful 'Ur-Mind' which will benevolently rule mankind?\" The pen tilts left. No. Oh well. Perhaps we are better off with the physicists after all. \"I never think of the future,\" Einstein said once. \"It comes soon enough.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "How do you make God laugh? It is an old joke. The answer: \"Tell him about your plans.\" The physicist Niels Bohr put it more scientifically: \"Prediction is very difficult,\" he wrote, \"especially about the future.\" These days, however, if it is the future you seek, you can find a host of helping hands online. The Chinese have been using divination tools for three millennia, so a good place to start is www.myfortune 21.com, \"an amalgamation of the wonders of Oriental intelligence and modern scientific technology\". Here you can discover your fortune through traditional games such as Shake the Tortoise, or input the date and time of your birth to discover the \"weight\" of your life. Apparently, mine weighs 5.6kg, guaranteeing \"great success and good fortune\". At www.aquarianage.org/china/diary, Ping Wu's Taoist Diary uses Chinese astrology to predict world events. His millennium prediction is for a unified Europe, releasing \"unbelievable power\" - but also war and dark years until 2003. You might need a cup of tea after that. Willa G Cline used to offer to drink a cup then give a real tea-leaf reading over the web; it must have been oversubscribed as the service has now been automated www.willa.com/tealeaves/. There is also a QuickTime tea-cup: give it a stir at www.worldtea.net. Once you have your strength back and feel up to a stronger brew, try www.facade.com. Methods on offer here include Bibliomancy, where a random phrase is plucked from the King James Bible; a variety of Runes (will Microsoft always dominate the desktop? The Gold Runes seem to think so); I-Ching; and even a lawyers' page for instant legal divination. I asked: \"How is my mortgage coming along?\" and was told, \"We have sent the forms which seem right for you.\" Creepy. Facade treads a nice line between the occult and self-satire: the biorhythms section produces accurate charts, but if you leave the dates blank you get the life-rhythms of Sandra Bullock. At least, I hope that's satire. Perhaps the most well-known divination tool is the Tarot deck. The Tarot emerged from traditional playing cards in the 16th century, and has since burgeoned into hundreds of styles. Facade offers comprehensive Tarot readings from eight classic decks. If the concerns of 500 years ago seem outdated, Silicon Valley Tarot promises fortune-telling cards for the information age. (\"Cheaper than a consultant. Same results.\") The cards are tailored to fit the anxieties of our time: The Layoff replaces Death; Strength has become Double Latte. I asked: \"Should we ever buy tech stock again?\" and got The Eight of Cubicles: \"Time for a sabbatical.\" We knew that much already. Other modern divination methods include Aaron's Fortune Telling Program, which claims to \"read the psychic impression you have made on your computer over the years.\" The fortune delivered is strangely specific - apparently, I'll be \"caught at the US/Canada border.\" There are plenty of other offbeat oracles out there: you can ask a Klingon); Elvis the dog; even the A-Team's Mr T, who, true to form, says \"No, sucka!\" or \"Quit that jibber- jabber!\" to just about everything. The accuracy of predictions about the future is debatable. Still, there is no doubt that the more genuine divination methods such as the Tarot and the I-Ching help focus the mind on troublesome issues, and the accompanying texts are age-old stores of human wisdom. Plus, making predictions is fun. So what does the new millennium hold for mankind? Will George \"Dubya\" Bush last more than a term? Mr T says: \"No, sucka!\" Will 3G mobile live up to its hype - and its hyped licence costs? The Coney Island Fairground Madame says: \"Don't travel.\" Sounds like a no. Will the world's oil reserves be replaced by alternative energy sources in time to save civilisation? A single card from Facade's St Petersburg Tarot (the Star) indicates \"Hope, Faith, Inspiration. Bright prospects.\" Phew. We will leave the last word to my favourite divination method, the Yes/No floaty pen. \"Are monkeys following me?\" Yes, the pen says, but I knew that already. How about the one answer I have always wanted? \"Oh, all-wise floaty pen, in this next millennium, will the internet blossom into an all-powerful 'Ur-Mind' which will benevolently rule mankind?\" The pen tilts left. No. Oh well. Perhaps we are better off with the physicists after all. \"I never think of the future,\" Einstein said once. \"It comes soon enough.\"",

In practical terms he is imprisoned in a straitjacket of his own creation. One of the first things he did when he came into office was to make the Bank of England independent of the Treasury when it fixed interest rates. This was intended to stop him, and future chancellors, from engaging in a pre-election tax-cutting bonanza. The consequence is that if Mr Brown attempts to give away more than is deemed prudent by the Bank (which is ever mindful of the reaction of the city's financial markets) then interest rates would be raised very soon after the budget - thereby, among other things, putting more short-term upward pressure on sterling. If, however, he were to reduce taxes (or increase spending) by less than prudence dictates, the Bank might move swiftly to reduce rates again. At the moment, the feeling in the City is that Mr Brown could just about get away with tax cuts or spending increases of \u00a33bn to \u00a34bn this year (and nearly twice that next year) without jeopardising his prudent fiscal stance, and that changes of less than \u00a32bn would soon lead to a sharper drop in rates than would otherwise have occurred.</p> <p>Mr Brown is almost certainly keeping some tax-cutting wheezes up his sleeve, even though the broad scope of the budget has already been set out in his pre-budget report in November. Despite public clamour, he has dug his heels in against attempts force the Treasury to abandon its public/private partnership approach to the London Tube in favour of Ken Livingstone's plans and he is also resisting calls to put more money into Railtrack. He strongly believes that the course he is pursuing is the most cost-effective use of public funds.

The Conservatives now freely admit that had they been re-elected they would have spent more than Labour did. In these circumstances, and with the underlying strength of government finances continuing to improve, Mr Brown should err on the side of spending too much rather than too little. There are some sensitive areas where a little extra spending could produce beneficial results with minimal ill-effects on the economy.

      "body": "<p>\" Hello, and welcome back to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Before the break, Gordon Brown had already won \u00a3250,000 and for \u00a3500,000 he was asked which of the following countries had the poorest public services - Sweden, France, the United Kingdom and Germany. Gordon, you said the United Kingdom... it's the right answer; you've just won \u00a3500,000. You couldn't see her, but your girlfriend Prudence is so relieved.</p> <p>\"Now, Gordon, the next question is for one million pounds. You've got all three lifelines left - ask the audience, phone a friend, 50-50. You might as well have a look at the next question. You don't have to play but it's worth a million pounds. The UK government is on course for a record budget surplus of \u00a318bn this year. Should it be A: Spent all at once on a nationwide chain of millennium domes, B: Saved for a rainy day, C: Used for tax cuts, or D: Invested long-term in rebuilding Britain's decrepit public infrastructure?</p> <p>\"Gordon, you had a smile on your face when that question was coming up. Confident?\"</p> <p>\"Well, Chris, I'm the chancellor of the exchequer so it's the sort of question I should get right. But, to be honest, the amount of money rolling into the treasury is becoming embarrassing, so it's not quite so simple as it looks.\"</p> <p>\"What are you thinking, Gordon?\"</p> <p>\"Well, it's definitely not A. There's definitely going to be a much bigger surplus than I said in my pre-Budget report in November, but that figure of \u00a310bn was always for the birds. It will probably be \u00a317bn or \u00a318bn, although I'll only admit to around \u00a315bn in the Budget, so that it doesn't look too miserly when I only give a couple of billion of it away.</p> <p>\"That said, trying to spend all the money makes no sense. Departments are not even spending the money they've already got. I gave them \u00a37bn to spend on the infrastructure this year and after 10 months of the year they've only got through \u00a32.2bn.\"</p> <p>\"That's fascinating, Gordon. Why's that, do you think?\"</p> <p>\"It's the final revenge of Mrs Thatcher, Chris. The idea that spending public money was bad burrowed its way deep into the Whitehall psyche. Neo-liberalism is stronger than you might imagine. The fact that I froze public spending in my first two years as chancellor merely strengthened the hand of officials for whom spending taxpayers' money is a mortal sin.\"</p> <p>\"And what about the other options?\"</p> <p>\"I'm certain it's not C. Spending the money on tax cuts would be economic suicide and, in any case, it's not what the country needs. Falling unemployment and rising confidence means that consumer spending is already growing at 4% a year, and it's something of a surprise that after almost nine years of growth inflation is as low as it is. Besides, Britain's problem is that we have always spent too much and invested too little. Giving consumers even more to spend would simply open up a big gap between the demand for goods and services and the economy's ability to supply them. The result would be a splurge of inflation and an explosion in the trade deficit: probably both.\"</p> <p>\"OK Gordon, your call. What are you going to do?\"</p> <p>\"I've got my three lifelines, Chris, so I'll go 50-50.\"</p> <p>\"Computer take away two wrong answers. There we are, Gordon, just as you thought. It's not tax cuts and it's not spend, spend, spend. It's B or D. Not a lot of help really. Do you want to play?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, I think I'll go with B, Chris. Yes, definitely B: stash it away for a rainy day.</p> <p>\"Final answer?\"</p> <p>\"I think so, Chris. You see, saving the surplus for a rainy day keeps the Bank of England and the City sweet. There's a mortgage war going on, which may lead to another burst of inflation in the property market. At this point, nothing should be done that should frighten the horses. Banking the surplus also cuts interest payments on the national debt, which means the government can spend more on the good things in life, such as schools and hospitals.</p> <p>\" What's more I am investing long-term. I've already big plans for the next three years - doubling capital spending, increasing spending on health and education by 6% above the rate of inflation. The surplus is huge now, but we'll be borrowing money again quite soon, and I'm determined not to repeat the mistakes made by Lawson in the late 80s.</p> <p>\"One way of squaring the circle would be to raise taxation to levels seen in most other countries in western Europe, because that would mop up the extra demand. But higher taxation is the love that dare not speak its name, because Britain is now a low-tax nation. That was another of Mrs Thatcher's legacies. So it must be B.\"</p> <p>\"Final answer?\"</p> <p>\"Final answer. But wait a minute. It could be D. To be honest, the public sector is in a pretty dreadful state. We spent even less in our first two years than the Tories were planning to spend had they been re-elected, and I know, because Ken Clarke told me, that he wouldn't have stuck to his own plans anyway. Discretionary public spending has risen by 2% a year during the past four years, slightly less than John Major's government spent between 1992 and 1997.\"</p> <p>\"And that's a problem is it, Gordon?\"</p> <p>\"You bet. It's why the schools don't have enough teachers. It's why the health service is increasingly staffed by doctors and nurses from overseas, and it's why the transport system doesn't work. Relative to the state of the economy, the public sector is in an even worse state now than when we took over. Even by 2003-4, we will be spending less as a proportion of the economy than the Conservatives did in 15 or their 18 years in power.</p> <p>There's certainly a case for using the budget surplus more imaginatively to reinvigorate the public realm.

But it's your call. The audience may be wrong. They have been in the past. But most of them don't think you should wait for a rainy day. They think the rainy day is already here.\" larry.elliott@theguardian.com",

But, at 62, Amos Oz is still the ruggedly handsome man who has served as pin-up to the Israeli peace movement - and the country's number one literary export - for more than three decades. </p> <p>His writings are still devoured, his commentaries on Middle East politics translated and published around the world. So what could be more timely than a book from Oz right now, just as his country comes to yet another crossroads - five months into a new intifada and a fortnight after the election of Ariel Sharon, the most rightwing prime minister in Israeli history? </p> <p>After all, isn't Amos Oz the leading spokesman for the Jewish state's dovish left, an advocate since 1967 of peaceful, if painful, compromise with the Palestinians? Surely he will be burning up with talk of Barak and Arafat, Oslo and Camp David? </p> <p>Not quite. Oz is in London to speak about The Same Sea, a poetic novel of love, family and loss which refers to the peace process only once - and then as gently comic metaphor. A few Israeli politicians make appearances, but they are mentioned only once. Instead we have the monologues and musings of an ensemble of Israelis - a widower, his dead wife, their backpacking son and his gorgeous, if drifting girlfriend, a lonely widow - rendered in short blocks of prose, poetry and even rhyming verse. It is, avowedly, a work of art, not politics - a break from the din of the conflict, and a journey into the quieter, more elusive terrain of the heart. </p> <p>Will the politicos be disappointed? Of course they will. One Sunday newspaper reviewed The Same Sea alongside a news photograph of Jewish settlers on the West Bank and branded the novel \"an allegory of the Middle East crisis\". </p> <p>\"I find it bewildering,\" says Oz, settling into a couch in the north London home of his brother, his regular lodging when on tour here. \"It would be like accompanying a review of an introverted British novel with a picture of English football hooligans.\" </p> <p>But Oz is used to it. He speaks of the long \"Judeo-Slavonic tradition\" which refuses to let writers simply be writers - insisting instead that they be latter-day prophets for their people, guiding them through the wilderness. </p> <p>\"I detect a certain condescension to authors from troubled countries,\" he says, noting the assumption that they can write about nothing but political strife. \"No one expected Virginia Woolf to write about the Munich agreement, but everyone assumes my novels are parables about the new intifada.\" </p> <p>The Same Sea is a powerful rebuke to such thinking. It is, says Oz, \"a political statement about the importance of things that are not in the headlines. Even in a tornado-struck country, people still worry about tax forms, they fantasise about promotion, they have dreams about the neighbour's wife - even when the next hurricane is coming. The Israeli people does not exist solely in the suffocating space between settlements and holy places, Sephardim and Ashkenazim, secular and religious.\" So Oz is pleading for the world to see Israel as a regular country - not just the backdrop to war we see on the television news? \"I don't have to plead for it. I just reflect what's already there.\" </p> <p>But The Same Sea is more than a reflection of the humdrum reality of Israeli life. It is a work so exquisitely written, so diamond-clear, that critics are already hailing it as perhaps Oz's finest work. Every page, some of them inhabited by just three or four lines of text, shines with polished, chiselled poetry. As Nadia prepares for her own death, she is \"like a woman who has nearly/finished washing the floor, walking backwards towards the door, drawing/the mop towards her, all she has left to do is to wipe away the traces on/the wet floor of her own footprints.\" </p> <p>Oz does not dismiss the buzz that says The Same Sea is his greatest achievement. He laboured on it for five years, fleeing his home in Israel's Negev desert to a remote mountain village in Cyprus for the seclusion he needed to complete it. He sees it as the realisation of a lifetime ambition. </p> <p>\"I have finally fulfilled a fantasy, of bridging the gap between writing novels and poetry, between writing literature and making music. I see this as a work of choral music, a polyphonic assembly of voices - a madrigal of six or seven players.\" </p> <p>For Oz, it is a departure: he has written poetry all his life, but never published it. And, for the first time, he has made himself a character: the Narrator, whom the widow and the widower call on the phone, occasionally to harangue about politics. The result - containing, says Oz, \"life and fiction, music and storytelling, metaphysics and mischief\" - defies easy categorisation. Oz told a recent gathering of puzzled Israeli librarians, who had asked where they should stack The Same Sea, they \"should let the book sleep on a different shelf every night\". </p> <p>Some familiar Oz motifs are here - interlocking love triangles, oedipal longings, unspoken, semi-incestuous desires - but this novel goes further than the others. It addresses head on, for example, the suicide of Oz's mother, when he was just 12 and a half: the event whose mystery the writer says he has spent his life, and his books, \"trying to decode\". That fact has hovered throughout Oz's fiction; here it is stated as fact. </p> <p>The overall effect is unexpectedly pleasing. Oz quotes heavily from Kohelet, the book of Ecclesiastes and its \"all is vanity\" meditation on life's futility. The author notes repeatedly that all our struggles come to nought in the end, that even the greatest fortunes are gone when we are dead, and that every one of us ends life alone. </p> <p>And yet, he insists, \"this book is no lamentation. The fact that everything turns to dust is not just depressing, it's also very funny. We're like children building palaces on the sand.\" For Oz, gloom and joy, sensuality and despair, are not mutually exclusive - they feed off each other. Death and life are next-door neighbours. </p> <p>And so there is something of the playful grandfather about the Amos Oz of 2001. He has seen life, even its futility, but has come to cherish its wonders and its love. He retains his optimism - even about his troubled land. Maybe the new prime minister will make peace, he suggests, just as the hardline Menachem Begin did before him. </p> <p>Maybe Arafat and Sharon will prove to be kindred spirits, former hardmen who \"find they share a common language\". Maybe it is a good sign that even Sharon felt compelled to promise peace, rather than victory, in his election campaign. But those are discussions for another day, when Oz the polemicist is stirred to rage. Today he is Oz the poet and artist - and even the land of Israel needs those. </p> <p>\u0095 Amos Oz's The Same Sea is published by Chatto &amp; Windus, price \u00a314.99.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the face of widespread famine, limited foreign aid and tough new sanctions, Afghanistan's Taliban regime is finally moving towards a compromise over demands for the extradition of the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Pakistan's interior minister, Moinuddin Haider, who met the militia's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, this month, said the Taliban would consider allowing Islamic scholars to meet abroad to hear evidence against Bin Laden and decide his fate.</p> <p>It is the first time the idea of a trial outside Afghanistan has been raised. However US state department officials yesterday questioned the seriousness of the offer, pointing out that it did not contain an undertaking that Bin Laden would be made to attend the hearing.</p> <p>Bin Laden, a Saudi exile now believed to be living in a base in central Afghanistan, has been charged by a New York court with masterminding the bombing of two US embassies in east Africa in 1998 which killed 224 people.</p> <p>The Taliban have refused to hand him over to any foreign government, although they have offered to put him on trial in Afghanistan if the US provides evidence against him.</p> <p>Last month the UN security council imposed a new round of sanctions on the Taliban, including an arms embargo, to press for his extradition.</p> <p>In an interview, Gen Haider said: \"Mullah Omar said that he was ready for religious scholars from Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and a third Muslim country to collect in some place and having seen the evidence then this group would decide what is to be done to him. If we speak to the Taliban it is possible that they [the scholars] could meet in another country.\"</p> <p>No country has been identified as a venue for any trial. The Taliban would probably insist on another Islamic state.</p> <p>Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have diplomatic relations with the regime but they may not be willing to risk involvement in such a sensitive case. Holding a trial in countries such as Iraq or Libya would be unlikely to satisfy western governments.</p> <p>Assessing Gen Haider's remarks, an expert on Bin Laden at the US state department said they did not represent a step forward.</p> <p>\"This isn't a real trial we're talking about,\" he said, arguing that there was no indication that Bin Laden would be made to attend, nor was it clear what weight would be given to the scholars' findings.</p> <p>However, some US Bin Laden-watchers saw signs of movement in the Taliban's position. Patrick Clawson, director of research at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said: \"It looks as if [the Taliban] are serious about negotiations over Osama's future. It's significant that they specify which countries the scholars would come from, and say it can be outside Afghanistan.

      "bodyText": "In the face of widespread famine, limited foreign aid and tough new sanctions, Afghanistan's Taliban regime is finally moving towards a compromise over demands for the extradition of the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden. Pakistan's interior minister, Moinuddin Haider, who met the militia's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, this month, said the Taliban would consider allowing Islamic scholars to meet abroad to hear evidence against Bin Laden and decide his fate. It is the first time the idea of a trial outside Afghanistan has been raised. However US state department officials yesterday questioned the seriousness of the offer, pointing out that it did not contain an undertaking that Bin Laden would be made to attend the hearing. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile now believed to be living in a base in central Afghanistan, has been charged by a New York court with masterminding the bombing of two US embassies in east Africa in 1998 which killed 224 people. The Taliban have refused to hand him over to any foreign government, although they have offered to put him on trial in Afghanistan if the US provides evidence against him. Last month the UN security council imposed a new round of sanctions on the Taliban, including an arms embargo, to press for his extradition. In an interview, Gen Haider said: \"Mullah Omar said that he was ready for religious scholars from Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and a third Muslim country to collect in some place and having seen the evidence then this group would decide what is to be done to him. If we speak to the Taliban it is possible that they [the scholars] could meet in another country.\" No country has been identified as a venue for any trial. The Taliban would probably insist on another Islamic state. Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have diplomatic relations with the regime but they may not be willing to risk involvement in such a sensitive case. Holding a trial in countries such as Iraq or Libya would be unlikely to satisfy western governments. Assessing Gen Haider's remarks, an expert on Bin Laden at the US state department said they did not represent a step forward. \"This isn't a real trial we're talking about,\" he said, arguing that there was no indication that Bin Laden would be made to attend, nor was it clear what weight would be given to the scholars' findings. However, some US Bin Laden-watchers saw signs of movement in the Taliban's position. Patrick Clawson, director of research at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said: \"It looks as if [the Taliban] are serious about negotiations over Osama's future. It's significant that they specify which countries the scholars would come from, and say it can be outside Afghanistan. Clearly if it was in Saudi Arabia or Egypt, the US would be delighted.\" The new UN sanctions come at a time of worsening drought and civil war in Afghanistan. More than a million people are facing famine this year and 500,000 have fled their homes in search of food. Donations of international aid have slowed since the Taliban took power. The regime has tried to win international approval by outlawing opium production. But the issue of the Saudi terrorist remains the biggest hurdle to the Taliban's hopes of international support. Now Pakistan is ready to support the idea of a trial abroad. Gen Haider said: \"I think the new administration in America should look at the problem with a fresh approach. To break the ice they should create some flexibility in their demands also.\" Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf said in an interview this month: \"Between the American and the Afghan extreme stances it is possible that the United States and Afghanistan can choose another country where Bin Laden can have a fair trial.\" Useful links: FBI 'most wanted' notice for Bin Laden Federation of American Scientists information on Bin Laden",

The question will not be taken into account when the competition is judged. The question was: Irvine Welsh's Acid House Trilogy consists of which tales? It then gave a choice of four possible answers, but omitted the correct one. Since the question is now void, here is the answer: The Granton Star Cause, The Acid House, and A Soft Touch. \u0095 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

      "body": "<p>The man in the black leather jacket looks nervously around him as he is approached by another man in a dark blue ski jacket and grey woolly hat. They talk briefly, then the first man says something into a walkie-talkie. A couple of minutes later a third, younger, man joins them. </p> <p>They huddle together. The younger man hands over a bundle of green cards to the first man. The second man then hurries off, slipping a card carefully into his inside pocket. </p> <p>Almost immediately the ritual exchange is repeated. This time the man in the leather jacket can be heard apologising. \"Sorry, we don't want to rip anybody off. It's those bastards at ONdigital. It's a tenner to reprogramme the card.\" </p> <p>In the space of the next 10 minutes, half a dozen customers hand over their money for a working card. It is a nice little earner for the trader: the process of reprogramming takes the token techie sitting in the back of an old van just a few seconds, using a device which only costs around \u00a350. </p> <p>These exchanges are the public face of a cat-and-mouse game being played between broadcaster ONdigi tal and a loosely linked network of pirates. The green cards - a printed circuit board mounted with two chips - offer access to every ONdigital channel. That includes Sky's sports and movie channels, Film Four, pay-per-view, even the so-called \"adult\" channels. </p> <p>Porn is a particular attraction for purchasers of the pirate cards. However carefully the name is disguised, a man may still have to account for the \u00a36.99 monthly subscription on his credit card or bank statement. With a pirate card this is not an issue. </p> <p>Whatever the reason, the pirates at Ingliston Market on the outskirts of Edinburgh are doing a roaring trade in ONdigital cards. The trade has to be attractive for buyers and sellers because, as shopping experiences go, Ingliston on a February morning is not one of the best. </p> <p>The market itself is in the midst of flat potato fields with little shelter from the falling sleet and icy wind except the ineffectual plastic awnings covering the stalls. The only permanent fixtures are a blue and white toilet block and, for some reason, a huge grey concrete statue of a gorilla. </p> <p>Twenty years ago the crowds came for cheap denim and dubious antiques but, gradually, the legitimate trade has faded away. There are still legitimate stalls selling everything from fruit and veg to clothes, but while most street markets have a dodgy side few in Britain are so dominated by trade in illicit goods as this one. </p> <p>Online has made several attempts to contact the managing director of the market's operating company, which is based several hundred miles away in the English Midlands. Although he did not respond to our phone messages, the initial response of the person who answered our calls was to say: \"We do condemn the sale of pirate goods. But you had better speak to our managing director.\" </p> <p>Eric Robinson, head of regulatory services at Edinburgh City Council, knows of the problem at Inglis ton. \"If you said to me that the majority of stalls at Ingliston were selling counterfeit goods, I'm sure my officers would not disagree with you,\" he says. </p> <p>The problem for the local trading standards officers is the massive amount of work created by raids on stalls. To prove their case after each raid, each counterfeit item has to be identified as such by the legitimate manufacturers. \"About eight stalls is the most we can deal with in a raid. We have to target them and arrive at the same time,\" says Robinson. \"You do get swamped by the work. It ties up a huge proportion of the staff... The work involved in bringing it to court is not worth the effort.\" </p> <p>Robinson denies this is defeatist talk, saying the department is working on \"other avenues\", but in the meantime the brisk business goes on. On the day of Online's visit, stall after stall is filled with PlayStation or Dreamcast games for a fiver each. Videos of films that have just hit the cinema screens are also a steal at just \u00a35. Elsewhere, customers flip through ring binders filled with sheets listing PC or Macintosh games and utility software sometimes worth hundreds of pounds. A CD-rom crammed with programs will set you back \u00a310 - or \u00a315 if you look middle class. </p> <p>This is also where the black economy meets the new economy. Despite there being apparently dozens of stalls competing with each other, in fact there are rather less in terms of suppliers. And much of the trade runs through a single website. </p> <p>Regular customers are told the address of this site so that they can go and see what the latest offers are and make their orders. Because of the way the trade is organised there are only a limited number of discs physically available. The pirates \"burn\" CD-roms as necessary. </p> <p>This means that not only do they not have to hold stock that might not sell, but in the event of a raid there is little to lose. Blank CDs, their main raw material, now cost less than 50p each when bought in bulk. </p> <p>The website also has another customer service role. If you have problems with the software you can get advice both from the site's operators and from other users. This goes for the ONdigital cards as well, because these generally need one vital piece of information. The codes. </p> <p>In common with other pay-to-air broadcasters, ONdigital uses a combination of a set-top box and a smart card that plugs into it. These cards are the size of a credit card with a gold chip near the top which is, in effect, a tiny computer. Every month a set of codes is sent out that tell the card that channels can be unscrambled. The trick is how to get the codes onto the pirate cards. </p> <p>There are two main methods. The first, which was popular at places such as Ingliston until recently, auto-updated the cards with the codes as they were broadcast. These, however, are vulnerable to \"electronic countermeasures\" (ECMs). What ONdigital did was to send out signals that knocked out these cards while leaving the legitimate ones untouched. </p> <p> The crackers, meanwhile, had developed a way of getting updated codes on to their cards. The second method takes advantage of the \"parental lock\" which is intended to prevent children from watching unsuitable programmes. </p> <p>It uses a pin number which is set using the ONdigital box's remote control. The viewer with the pirate card uses the same method to enter nine sets of four-digit codes with a few other key presses to get another month of free ONdigital programmes. </p> <p>Or they did until recently. ONdigital began sending out a signal periodically in January which prevented the cards being recognised and updated through the child lock. Within hours, however, notices were posted in internet discussion groups explaining how two legs on a pirate card's chip could be disconnected to make them write only and, therefore, in theory invulnerable to an ECM. The following Sunday, cards began to appear at Ingliston and elsewhere with a built-in switch. </p> <p>For the more sophisticated user, cards at around \u00a38 each and programmers for \u00a350 or so are readily available from people who advertise on the internet or who run stalls at computer fairs. From internet discussion groups it is clear that many are used by groups of friends in offices or pubs. </p> <p>ONdigital claims to be unworried by the problem. \"We take it seriously, but it's not a major cause of concern,\" says a spokesman. \"There are occasional outbreaks. But it comes and goes. Generally the people who suffer are the ones who buy the cards.\" </p> <p>The crackers exchanging information across the internet believe that ONdigital is more concerned than it lets on. One website until recently opened with a screen that looked exactly the same as ONdigital's, except the slogan was changed. Instead of \"Isn't it time you switched on?\", it read: \"Isn't it time you stopped paying?\" </p> <p>The website is still operating, but sports an angry threat of legal action against any ONdigital employee attempting to enter the site. </p> <p>Many of the websites are hosted overseas, which would make it hard for ONdigital to take legal action to close them down. The trade itself is also international. In Europe some estimates put as high as 20% the proportion of people watching satellite television without paying. </p> <p>In North America, pirates have been able to exploit differences the law between the US and Canada to openly sell hundreds of thousands of cards for DirecTV, the satellite broadcaster currently being taken over by Rupert Murdoch.

      "bodyText": "The man in the black leather jacket looks nervously around him as he is approached by another man in a dark blue ski jacket and grey woolly hat. They talk briefly, then the first man says something into a walkie-talkie. A couple of minutes later a third, younger, man joins them. They huddle together. The younger man hands over a bundle of green cards to the first man. The second man then hurries off, slipping a card carefully into his inside pocket. Almost immediately the ritual exchange is repeated. This time the man in the leather jacket can be heard apologising. \"Sorry, we don't want to rip anybody off. It's those bastards at ONdigital. It's a tenner to reprogramme the card.\" In the space of the next 10 minutes, half a dozen customers hand over their money for a working card. It is a nice little earner for the trader: the process of reprogramming takes the token techie sitting in the back of an old van just a few seconds, using a device which only costs around \u00a350. These exchanges are the public face of a cat-and-mouse game being played between broadcaster ONdigi tal and a loosely linked network of pirates. The green cards - a printed circuit board mounted with two chips - offer access to every ONdigital channel. That includes Sky's sports and movie channels, Film Four, pay-per-view, even the so-called \"adult\" channels. Porn is a particular attraction for purchasers of the pirate cards. However carefully the name is disguised, a man may still have to account for the \u00a36.99 monthly subscription on his credit card or bank statement. With a pirate card this is not an issue. Whatever the reason, the pirates at Ingliston Market on the outskirts of Edinburgh are doing a roaring trade in ONdigital cards. The trade has to be attractive for buyers and sellers because, as shopping experiences go, Ingliston on a February morning is not one of the best. The market itself is in the midst of flat potato fields with little shelter from the falling sleet and icy wind except the ineffectual plastic awnings covering the stalls. The only permanent fixtures are a blue and white toilet block and, for some reason, a huge grey concrete statue of a gorilla. Twenty years ago the crowds came for cheap denim and dubious antiques but, gradually, the legitimate trade has faded away. There are still legitimate stalls selling everything from fruit and veg to clothes, but while most street markets have a dodgy side few in Britain are so dominated by trade in illicit goods as this one. Online has made several attempts to contact the managing director of the market's operating company, which is based several hundred miles away in the English Midlands. Although he did not respond to our phone messages, the initial response of the person who answered our calls was to say: \"We do condemn the sale of pirate goods. But you had better speak to our managing director.\" Eric Robinson, head of regulatory services at Edinburgh City Council, knows of the problem at Inglis ton. \"If you said to me that the majority of stalls at Ingliston were selling counterfeit goods, I'm sure my officers would not disagree with you,\" he says. The problem for the local trading standards officers is the massive amount of work created by raids on stalls. To prove their case after each raid, each counterfeit item has to be identified as such by the legitimate manufacturers. \"About eight stalls is the most we can deal with in a raid. We have to target them and arrive at the same time,\" says Robinson. \"You do get swamped by the work. It ties up a huge proportion of the staff... The work involved in bringing it to court is not worth the effort.\" Robinson denies this is defeatist talk, saying the department is working on \"other avenues\", but in the meantime the brisk business goes on. On the day of Online's visit, stall after stall is filled with PlayStation or Dreamcast games for a fiver each. Videos of films that have just hit the cinema screens are also a steal at just \u00a35. Elsewhere, customers flip through ring binders filled with sheets listing PC or Macintosh games and utility software sometimes worth hundreds of pounds. A CD-rom crammed with programs will set you back \u00a310 - or \u00a315 if you look middle class. This is also where the black economy meets the new economy. Despite there being apparently dozens of stalls competing with each other, in fact there are rather less in terms of suppliers. And much of the trade runs through a single website. Regular customers are told the address of this site so that they can go and see what the latest offers are and make their orders. Because of the way the trade is organised there are only a limited number of discs physically available. The pirates \"burn\" CD-roms as necessary. This means that not only do they not have to hold stock that might not sell, but in the event of a raid there is little to lose. Blank CDs, their main raw material, now cost less than 50p each when bought in bulk. The website also has another customer service role. If you have problems with the software you can get advice both from the site's operators and from other users. This goes for the ONdigital cards as well, because these generally need one vital piece of information. The codes. In common with other pay-to-air broadcasters, ONdigital uses a combination of a set-top box and a smart card that plugs into it. These cards are the size of a credit card with a gold chip near the top which is, in effect, a tiny computer. Every month a set of codes is sent out that tell the card that channels can be unscrambled. The trick is how to get the codes onto the pirate cards. There are two main methods. The first, which was popular at places such as Ingliston until recently, auto-updated the cards with the codes as they were broadcast. These, however, are vulnerable to \"electronic countermeasures\" (ECMs). What ONdigital did was to send out signals that knocked out these cards while leaving the legitimate ones untouched. The crackers, meanwhile, had developed a way of getting updated codes on to their cards. The second method takes advantage of the \"parental lock\" which is intended to prevent children from watching unsuitable programmes. It uses a pin number which is set using the ONdigital box's remote control. The viewer with the pirate card uses the same method to enter nine sets of four-digit codes with a few other key presses to get another month of free ONdigital programmes. Or they did until recently. ONdigital began sending out a signal periodically in January which prevented the cards being recognised and updated through the child lock. Within hours, however, notices were posted in internet discussion groups explaining how two legs on a pirate card's chip could be disconnected to make them write only and, therefore, in theory invulnerable to an ECM. The following Sunday, cards began to appear at Ingliston and elsewhere with a built-in switch. For the more sophisticated user, cards at around \u00a38 each and programmers for \u00a350 or so are readily available from people who advertise on the internet or who run stalls at computer fairs. From internet discussion groups it is clear that many are used by groups of friends in offices or pubs. ONdigital claims to be unworried by the problem. \"We take it seriously, but it's not a major cause of concern,\" says a spokesman. \"There are occasional outbreaks. But it comes and goes. Generally the people who suffer are the ones who buy the cards.\" The crackers exchanging information across the internet believe that ONdigital is more concerned than it lets on. One website until recently opened with a screen that looked exactly the same as ONdigital's, except the slogan was changed. Instead of \"Isn't it time you switched on?\", it read: \"Isn't it time you stopped paying?\" The website is still operating, but sports an angry threat of legal action against any ONdigital employee attempting to enter the site. Many of the websites are hosted overseas, which would make it hard for ONdigital to take legal action to close them down. The trade itself is also international. In Europe some estimates put as high as 20% the proportion of people watching satellite television without paying. In North America, pirates have been able to exploit differences the law between the US and Canada to openly sell hundreds of thousands of cards for DirecTV, the satellite broadcaster currently being taken over by Rupert Murdoch. The broadcaster recently got its revenge, however, after it broadcast code, piece by piece, until it was able to knock out almost every pirate card on what has become known as 'Black Sunday'. DirecTV had waited until just before the Super Bowl to launch its attack, the equivalent of hitting the UK pirates on FA Cup Final day. The pirate internet discussion groups, meanwhile, are filled with concern that ONdigital might be plotting a similar attack.

Well, it is roughly the size of an office diary, and barely an inch thick. Not bad for an ultraportable with a 500MHz Intel Celeron or Pentium III. It only looks big to me because it is noticeably bigger than the machine it is designed to replace: the ultraportable ThinkPad 240. </p> <p>The 240 has become a classic, if that term can be applied to something with a shelf life of about 18 months. However, like the old IBM Butterfly keyboard, which extended, it has become a victim of the onward march of flat-screen technology. The X Series is bigger because it has a 12.1in colour LCD, whereas the 240 could only manage 10.4in. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the X as tested does not derive any particular benefit from the extra screen estate. Both machines run Windows with a resolution of only 800 by 600 pixels in 16-bit colour. As a result, you cannot see any more on the screen, it just looks a bigger - though at least you can buy an X Series with a 1024 by 768 resolution screen, which is not available on the 240. </p> <p>The larger screen size also makes room for a full-size keyboard and about a dozen extra keys. Again, however, the practical benefits are rather small, and both keyboards suffer from a few odd key placings. On the X Series, the most annoying is the Esc key, which is positioned above F1 instead of next to it. It is annoying to hit the F1 (Windows Help) key at all: hitting it several times a day becomes infuriating. </p> <p>Oddly, IBM has still not managed to find room for a Windows key. Even more oddly, there's no key to turn on the X's novel light, which is built in to the lid to illuminate the keyboard. There are three keys to operate the speaker (volume up, down and mute), but to turn the light on you have to press the Function and Page Up keys together. </p> <p>Where the X Series thrashes the 240 is in expandability, which is important in machines that do not have built-in floppy and CD-rom drives. Both can take port replicators. However, the X Series also has a neat bus connector on the underside, to mate with the optional UltraBase X2 Media Slice. This locks securely to the bottom and adds a floppy drive, a device bay, two stereo speakers, and a number of ports. The device bay can hold a CD-Rom, CD-RW or DVD-Rom drive, a 250MB Zip or LS-120 floppy, a second hard drive or an extra battery. But, instead of a stripped-down ultraportable, the result is a full-spec machine at a heavy price. And if that's what you want, you can buy something better and cheaper, even within IBM's current three ranges of ThinkPads. </p> <p>Nevertheless, I'm sure IBM is right. Today's buyers want bigger, higher-resolution screens, and they want full-sized keyboards. They also want expandable notebooks because many are now buying them as their main machine, not as adjuncts to desktop models. However, if you are the sort of oddball who wants a dinky little portable that will go almost anywhere, the ThinkPad 240 will do nicely. But buy now, because stocks are unlikely to last. </p>",

And if that's what you want, you can buy something better and cheaper, even within IBM's current three ranges of ThinkPads. Nevertheless, I'm sure IBM is right. Today's buyers want bigger, higher-resolution screens, and they want full-sized keyboards. They also want expandable notebooks because many are now buying them as their main machine, not as adjuncts to desktop models. However, if you are the sort of oddball who wants a dinky little portable that will go almost anywhere, the ThinkPad 240 will do nicely. But buy now, because stocks are unlikely to last.",

The Dublin-based firm posted pre-tax losses of \u00a394.2m, more than the \u00a331.4m loss it posted for 1999 but in line with expectations. Losses for the quarter rose from \u00a318.4m to \u00a355.2m, due to expansion in new regions according to Baltimore. Fran Rooney, Baltimore's chief executive, insisted the company, which has more than 40 offices in 17 countries, would be insulated from a slowdown in the US economy, partly because of the global nature of the business. Only 22% of revenues came from the US. Mr Rooney also pointed to growing demand for e-security. \"The market is expected to grow several hundred times over the next couple of years.\" Baltimore had \u00a3107m in the bank, he said, enough to take it to profitability in early 2002. The company did not post a dividend.",

Mr Jones fled the attack during a constituency surgery and escaped with severe cuts to his hands which needed 57 stitches and left him badly scarred. Ashman was arrested minutes afterwards as he walked out of the office with blood dripping from the sword. Mr Justice Toulson said Ashman was potentially a great danger and paid tribute to Mr Pennington's bravery.

      "body": "<p>It might have been much worse. At one point the FTSE 100 was staring into the abyss after stronger than expected US retail inflation data raised the prospect of a premature end to the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-cutting. </p> <p>Then the leading shares pulled back from the brink. Off 59 points after release of the data, which showed US consumer prices in January rising at their quickest pace in nearly a year, the FTSE 100 recovered to close only 7.7 points lower at 5,972.4, much to the relief of traders. </p> <p>Unlike Tuesday's session, when the blue chip index posted its biggest one-day points decline since early January, the heavyweight drugs sector provided a prop for the market. <strong> GlaxoSmithKline</strong> closed 75p higher at \u00a319.20p after full-year figures met City expectations, while <strong> Astra Zeneca </strong> added 255p to \u00a331.35 following US regulatory approval for Nexium, its follow-up to the blockbuster ulcer drug, Losec. </p> <p>The calm reaction of the Nasdaq to the consumer price data also helped, although it failed to do much for the FTSE Techmark 100, which settled 75.40 points lower at 2,400.20 after a sell-off of alternative telecom stocks. </p> <p> <strong> Atlantic Telecom</strong> (off 5p to 59p), <strong> Kingston Telecom</strong> (down 9.75p to 159.75p) and <strong> Redstone Telecom</strong> (15p weaker at 93.5p) all closed at record lows, undermined by the slump in US telecom stocks and bearish noises from ABN Amro. The Dutch broker, which lowered its rating on Kingston and Atlantic, gave warning to investors that there are too many players in the sector for all to achieve their long-term targets. </p> <p>The misery continued for shareholders of telecoms testing specialist <strong> Spirent</strong>. It shares - 485p a week ago - finished 26p lower at 389p, rattled by gloomy news from a US rival, Agilent Technologies. Although the Hewlett Packard spin-off reported better than expected results, it now expects sales growth of 10-15% this year, as opposed to analysts' forecasts of 19%. </p> <p>Back among the blue chips, <strong> Dixons</strong>, the electrical retailer, advanced 5.5p to 256p, thanks to ABN Amro repeating its \"buy\" rating after a meeting with company executives on Tuesday night. ABN was said to have come away with the impression that Dixons will meet its growth expectations. </p> <p>Buyers were also in good supply for <strong> Standard Chartered</strong>, which rose 45p to \u00a310.50 after the release of strong full-year figures, while <strong> BAT </strong> , up 15.25p to 549p, and <strong> Imperial Tobacco</strong>, 20p higher at 730p, were sought by investors for their defensive qualities. </p> <p>Lower down, break-up speculation again swirled around <strong> BBA</strong>, the aviation services and materials technology group. As far as anyone could tell, the tale was based on gossip that BBA, 11p stronger at 351p, was locked in meetings with its advisers yesterday. </p> <p>It could be that the advisers were working on a deal, but a more likely explanation is that they were preparing BBA's full-year results statement, due for March 6. Industry watchers dismissed the gossip as \"outlandish\". </p> <p>Housebuilder <strong> Persimmon</strong>, up 10p to 312p, continued its recent fightback, with UBS Warburg again the instigator. Repeating its \"strong buy\" rating, UBS said the outbreak of the mortgage war should be positive for the housebuilding sector. </p> <p>In the smaller companies universe, <strong> Cape</strong>, the building services group facing legal action from workers for asbestos poisoning, added 1p to 16p on news that construction and property group <strong> YJL</strong>, up 0.25p to 22.75p, had acquired a 14.9% stake. </p> <p>A spokesman for Cape said there had been no formal contact with YJL and it was \"awaiting developments\". </p> <p> <strong> Lastminute.com</strong> dropped to a record low of 53.5p, down 9p on the day. The internet retailer was floated at the height of the dot.com boom in March at 360p.</p>",

Off 59 points after release of the data, which showed US consumer prices in January rising at their quickest pace in nearly a year, the FTSE 100 recovered to close only 7.7 points lower at 5,972.4, much to the relief of traders. Unlike Tuesday's session, when the blue chip index posted its biggest one-day points decline since early January, the heavyweight drugs sector provided a prop for the market. GlaxoSmithKline closed 75p higher at \u00a319.20p after full-year figures met City expectations, while Astra Zeneca added 255p to \u00a331.35 following US regulatory approval for Nexium, its follow-up to the blockbuster ulcer drug, Losec. The calm reaction of the Nasdaq to the consumer price data also helped, although it failed to do much for the FTSE Techmark 100, which settled 75.40 points lower at 2,400.20 after a sell-off of alternative telecom stocks. Atlantic Telecom (off 5p to 59p), Kingston Telecom (down 9.75p to 159.75p) and Redstone Telecom (15p weaker at 93.5p) all closed at record lows, undermined by the slump in US telecom stocks and bearish noises from ABN Amro. The Dutch broker, which lowered its rating on Kingston and Atlantic, gave warning to investors that there are too many players in the sector for all to achieve their long-term targets. The misery continued for shareholders of telecoms testing specialist Spirent. It shares - 485p a week ago - finished 26p lower at 389p, rattled by gloomy news from a US rival, Agilent Technologies. Although the Hewlett Packard spin-off reported better than expected results, it now expects sales growth of 10-15% this year, as opposed to analysts' forecasts of 19%. Back among the blue chips, Dixons, the electrical retailer, advanced 5.5p to 256p, thanks to ABN Amro repeating its \"buy\" rating after a meeting with company executives on Tuesday night. ABN was said to have come away with the impression that Dixons will meet its growth expectations. Buyers were also in good supply for Standard Chartered, which rose 45p to \u00a310.50 after the release of strong full-year figures, while BAT , up 15.25p to 549p, and Imperial Tobacco, 20p higher at 730p, were sought by investors for their defensive qualities. Lower down, break-up speculation again swirled around BBA, the aviation services and materials technology group. As far as anyone could tell, the tale was based on gossip that BBA, 11p stronger at 351p, was locked in meetings with its advisers yesterday. It could be that the advisers were working on a deal, but a more likely explanation is that they were preparing BBA's full-year results statement, due for March 6. Industry watchers dismissed the gossip as \"outlandish\". Housebuilder Persimmon, up 10p to 312p, continued its recent fightback, with UBS Warburg again the instigator. Repeating its \"strong buy\" rating, UBS said the outbreak of the mortgage war should be positive for the housebuilding sector. In the smaller companies universe, Cape, the building services group facing legal action from workers for asbestos poisoning, added 1p to 16p on news that construction and property group YJL, up 0.25p to 22.75p, had acquired a 14.9% stake. A spokesman for Cape said there had been no formal contact with YJL and it was \"awaiting developments\". Lastminute.com dropped to a record low of 53.5p, down 9p on the day. The internet retailer was floated at the height of the dot.com boom in March at 360p.",

Earthly genetic information is carried in genes made of DNA, earthly life is based on polymers of carbon, and its chemistry happens in liquid water. Because this kind of life is all we know, we tend to think that the same rules need apply everywhere. So, when probes land on Mars, or scientists look at martian meteorites, they tend to look for the kinds of vital signs that betray earthly organisms when we have absolutely no reason for thinking that life elswhere should be earthlike, or that our definition of life cannot be based more broadly. When the Mars Rover sat and stared at a rock, how do we know that the rock was not staring right back? </p> <p>It is a fairly simple matter to come up with a definition of life that is based on what it does, rather than what it is made of. (It is much more difficult, however, to make such a definition stick, preventing the term life becoming so inclusive as to be meaningless.) </p> <p>You might start by positing three rules. The first is that life requires the existence of information that can be reproduced and inherited, with variation. Second, that living systems tend to reduce entropy locally (that is, they seem to create order and structure and maintain it in the face of chaos). Third, that living systems exist far from equilibrium. In other words, a living form has to work hard to maintain its structure, and as soon as it stops doing this (our parochial term for this state is death) it degenerates. </p> <p>These rules seem, at first, to be fairly precise, in as much as they weed out quietly observant martian surface rocks. But as Cohen and Stewart show in their novel, it is possible to imagine entities that follow all three rules and which seem to be alive, but which we would not recognise as earthly. In Wheelers, they describe civilizations of floating, methane-breathing balloons in the atmosphere of Jupiter and organisms made of magnetically confined plasma, sporting in the outer layers of the sun. </p> <p>Other SF writers have imagined life on the surfaces of neutron stars, inside computers, or even in interstellar space. In his latest novel, Look To Windward, Iain M Banks describes organisms the size of continents, supporting entire civilizations as their intestinal parasites.

I received a very pleasant letter back saying the birds would be taken into account and, yes, nest boxes would be included in the plans.</p> <p>A few weeks later another letter informed me that the RSPB had checked the nest and the young had flown so it was safe to start work. I have just come back from the bridge having seen one of the new boxes. The engineer in charge showed me the drawings of the nest box that were incorporated into the plan and was obviously very excited about the birds that had already been inspecting the new bridge.

Dippers were active under the ancient bridge, where their large domed nest looked like an overgrown wren's nest; a bird in front of me caught a small brown trout and bashed its head on a stone before flying to the bridge. A grey wagtail walked purposefully over a narrow strip of sand and drank from the river's shadows, and I felt at peace with the world; and yet looking back I should have thought of the old Swedish proverb: \"The afternoon knows what the morning never suspected.\" It was indeed that afternoon when the news broke about the old bridge being replaced, and my immediate reaction was concern about the dippers and their nest. So I wrote to the local council and pointed out that under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, the work would have to wait until the birds had flown, and chanced my arm even further by asking if nest boxes for dippers could be placed under the new bridge. I received a very pleasant letter back saying the birds would be taken into account and, yes, nest boxes would be included in the plans. A few weeks later another letter informed me that the RSPB had checked the nest and the young had flown so it was safe to start work. I have just come back from the bridge having seen one of the new boxes. The engineer in charge showed me the drawings of the nest box that were incorporated into the plan and was obviously very excited about the birds that had already been inspecting the new bridge. The war may not be over for wildlife, but a small battle has been won.",

And yet if mobile commerce is to succeed, as many believe it will, we will need better ways of inputting text than fiddling with nine tiny keys.</p> <p>So far, higher portability has meant a poorer input interface, but improvements are at hand. What is quickly becoming a global standard for mobile-phone input, T9, has soothed some of the stress. But for truly simple access, quicker interfaces are a must.</p> <p>The leader in this field, with its i-mode users permanently switched on to what the Japanese are calling the Evernet, Japan's DoCoMo has come up with quite a few novel ideas, such as a pen-size scanner for its 15 million wireless subscribers. The device clips neatly into mobile phones and can be used to scan bar codes at the end of magazine articles. To check out one of the products mentioned, you pass the pen over the stripes and your phone calls up the company's website. It can also be used to place orders from product and mail order catalogues, either via email or pages on the web. Japan is also pioneering a service where you key in a company's telephone number and the web page comes up.</p> <p>Wired magazine, too, is now promoting scanning of its pages, but as Jan Chipchase, a researcher at the Nokia Research Centre (NRC), Tokyo, points out: \"Would you carry a pen around with you just to scan articles?

      "bodyText": "Most people under 25 would rather eat their own heads than enter anything longer than a friend's name on their mobile. And yet if mobile commerce is to succeed, as many believe it will, we will need better ways of inputting text than fiddling with nine tiny keys. So far, higher portability has meant a poorer input interface, but improvements are at hand. What is quickly becoming a global standard for mobile-phone input, T9, has soothed some of the stress. But for truly simple access, quicker interfaces are a must. The leader in this field, with its i-mode users permanently switched on to what the Japanese are calling the Evernet, Japan's DoCoMo has come up with quite a few novel ideas, such as a pen-size scanner for its 15 million wireless subscribers. The device clips neatly into mobile phones and can be used to scan bar codes at the end of magazine articles. To check out one of the products mentioned, you pass the pen over the stripes and your phone calls up the company's website. It can also be used to place orders from product and mail order catalogues, either via email or pages on the web. Japan is also pioneering a service where you key in a company's telephone number and the web page comes up. Wired magazine, too, is now promoting scanning of its pages, but as Jan Chipchase, a researcher at the Nokia Research Centre (NRC), Tokyo, points out: \"Would you carry a pen around with you just to scan articles? I quite like the idea of scanning using a mobile. The biggest problem is having different bar code systems in different shops - there are compatibility problems - and whether there are enough magazines supporting this feature.\" Meanwhile, the next- generation wireless devices are now in development by Japanese electronics giants.

      "body": "<p>For a man who had almost single-handedly guaranteed Tranmere Rovers a place in FA Cup folklore the previous evening, Paul Rideout was in a surprisingly relaxed, almost philosophical mood yesterday. </p> <p>A matter of hours after scoring the hat-trick which led the way for the First Division's bottom team to knock one of his former clubs, Southampton, out of the competition by overturning their three-goal lead, Rideout was pondering relegation and the traditional theory that in football you remain on a learning curve until the moment you retire. </p> <p>\"I thought I had seen it all and done most things in football but what happened on Tuesday was remarkable, utterly remarkable,\" he said. \"That is the sort of game which comes around maybe once every 10 years if you are lucky. I just feel really privileged to have been a part of it.\" </p> <p>Trailing 3-0 at the interval, Rideout and his team-mates were verbally shredded by their manager at half-time before emerging to register one of the most memorable fight-backs in FA Cup history. </p> <p>\"We had been so awful in the first half that the possibility of going on to win the game never entered anyone's head,\" Rideout said. \"There were some harsh words exchanged during the break; there had to be. All we have to hope now is that we can play like that in our remaining league fixtures, because staying up is what really matters.\" </p> <p>As an intelligent, thinking man it is more than understandable that Rideout should spend his quieter moments reflecting upon the moment almost six years ago when his long, chequered career appeared to have reached its peak. </p> <p>It was on a May day back in 1995 that the then 30-year-old appeared to have penned a memorable footnote to his career by lifting himself off Wembley's turf to head Everton's winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester United. </p> <p>Two years later Rideout, who earlier had also played in Italy for Bari and Scotland for Rangers, spent time playing in China and then moved to the United States and turned out for Kansas City Wizards before returning for a final season in English football with Tranmere. </p> <p>It was to be no more than a reasonably lucrative epitaph, a halfway post between jobs. At least that is how it was until the astonishing events of Tuesday evening. </p> <p>If Rideout arrived at the ground in early evening nothing more than an ageing centre-forward with a healthy reputation, he departed some five hours later a 24-carat Tranmere legend, his place in Wirral folklore confirmed. </p> <p>In the space of 21 second-half minutes he claimed a faultless hat-trick before setting up Stuart Barlow for the fourth as Tranmere produced a Houdini-esque escape to shatter Glenn Hoddle's Premiership side. </p> <p>The fact that the win brought a home quarter-final date with Liverpool next month was almost forgotten as Rovers wallowed in one of knockout football's greatest comebacks. </p> <p>Rideout, who will celebrate his 37th birthday in August, is now seriously considering delaying his retirement for at least 12 months. \"I never really expected to be playing League football again in this country,\" he said. \"My family had settled in Kansas; they are still out there. [But] I am tempted to stay here for another season.\" </p> <p>The man who spoke the vast majority of the harsh half-time words to to which Rideout had referred was, predictably, the forthright John Aldridge. </p> <p>\"I couldn't believe we had come in three goals down,\" the manager said. \"We had been absolutely dire and I was determined to get something better out of my team. I didn't think we could do it but, when our first goal went in, I sensed that something big might happen; I could sense that some of the Southampton players were beginning to get a little worried.\" </p> <p>Liverpool's manager G\u00e9rard Houllier was watching from the main stand.

      "body": "<p>Chesterfield are to be charged today over a number of irregularities concerning payments to players and attendance figures that could jeopardise the team's push for promotion. </p> <p> The Football League is writing to the club outlining the charges that relate to irregular payments to players and falsified gate receipts. The charges follow a joint investigation between the Football League and the Football Association. </p> <p> According to reports, the irregular payments amount to almost \u00a330,000 in secret bonuses. </p> <p> Chesterfield are currently 14 points clear at the top of the Third Division. If the club are found guilty, then they could be relegated to the Conference or prevented from going up to the Second Division if they win promotion. </p> <p> The Chesterfield chairman Darren Brown yesterday defended his club, claiming that they had done nothing wrong and that he would challenge any charges. </p> <p> Brown said: \"We have paid no player anything like \u00a330,000 out of contract. No gate receipts have been fiddled at all and we will defend that to the hilt. </p> <p> \"I am not saying we have not made mistakes. But if they went to any league club they would find something.\" </p> <p> Brown, a 29-year-old businessman whose company also controls Sheffield Steelers and Hull Thunder ice hockey teams, is bracing himself for the possibility of stringent penalties. </p> <p> The experiences of Swindon in similar circumstances - which saw the Robins sent down a division in 1990 - is an uncomfortable precedent. </p> <p> According to reports, the FA and Football League investigation found that 16 players received \u00a3900 in illegal payments and others also received money. </p> <p> The payments were made outside the normal salaries and bonuses and the FA has asked the players to confess to receiving secret payments. Brown insists that the club will be able to offer an explanation to the charges and that some of the evidence submitted to the inquiry was incorrect. </p> <p> Hull City's administrators return to the High Court today armed with a salvage plan. The administrators will put the plan to Hull's creditors and shareholders on March 8 in the hope that the Third Division club can survive. </p> <p> Airdrie's liquidators KPMG yesterday asked the Scottish League to postpone Saturday's First Division match against Ross County - on the day that Diamonds supporters demonstrated outside the Glasgow offices of KPMG, who cancelled Steve Archibald's management contract and sacked most of the first-team squad.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Chesterfield are to be charged today over a number of irregularities concerning payments to players and attendance figures that could jeopardise the team's push for promotion. The Football League is writing to the club outlining the charges that relate to irregular payments to players and falsified gate receipts. The charges follow a joint investigation between the Football League and the Football Association. According to reports, the irregular payments amount to almost \u00a330,000 in secret bonuses. Chesterfield are currently 14 points clear at the top of the Third Division. If the club are found guilty, then they could be relegated to the Conference or prevented from going up to the Second Division if they win promotion. The Chesterfield chairman Darren Brown yesterday defended his club, claiming that they had done nothing wrong and that he would challenge any charges. Brown said: \"We have paid no player anything like \u00a330,000 out of contract. No gate receipts have been fiddled at all and we will defend that to the hilt. \"I am not saying we have not made mistakes. But if they went to any league club they would find something.\" Brown, a 29-year-old businessman whose company also controls Sheffield Steelers and Hull Thunder ice hockey teams, is bracing himself for the possibility of stringent penalties. The experiences of Swindon in similar circumstances - which saw the Robins sent down a division in 1990 - is an uncomfortable precedent. According to reports, the FA and Football League investigation found that 16 players received \u00a3900 in illegal payments and others also received money. The payments were made outside the normal salaries and bonuses and the FA has asked the players to confess to receiving secret payments. Brown insists that the club will be able to offer an explanation to the charges and that some of the evidence submitted to the inquiry was incorrect. Hull City's administrators return to the High Court today armed with a salvage plan. The administrators will put the plan to Hull's creditors and shareholders on March 8 in the hope that the Third Division club can survive. Airdrie's liquidators KPMG yesterday asked the Scottish League to postpone Saturday's First Division match against Ross County - on the day that Diamonds supporters demonstrated outside the Glasgow offices of KPMG, who cancelled Steve Archibald's management contract and sacked most of the first-team squad. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

About 3m people are believed to have policies that need \"top-ups\". </p> <p>ABI director general Mary Francis said: \"The reduced number of sales of mortgage-linked endowments last year is not surprising, given the enormous amount of publicity surrounding the endowment reprojection exercise undertaken by the insurance industry.\" </p> <p>She insisted that on average holders of endowments were no worse off than people who took out repayment mortgages. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association welcomed the collapse in endowment sales, which has seen nearly half of the former sellers quit the market over the past 12 months. \"People are now a lot more wary, they understand the risks involved and there is less scope for unscrupulous agents to push endowments,\" said CA spokesman Mick McAteer. </p> <p>Despite the drop in endowments, total sales of life, pensions and savings products grew by 5% in 2000 to reach \u00a353bn, the ABI said.

      "bodyText": "Sales of endowments fell by 56% last year as home buyers abandoned the controversial policies used for repaying mortgages, according to industry figures yesterday. The Association of British Insurers said sales of new mortgage-related endowments fell from \u00a3634m to \u00a3279m in 2000 amid concern that many existing policies will fail to repay home loans. About 3m people are believed to have policies that need \"top-ups\". ABI director general Mary Francis said: \"The reduced number of sales of mortgage-linked endowments last year is not surprising, given the enormous amount of publicity surrounding the endowment reprojection exercise undertaken by the insurance industry.\" She insisted that on average holders of endowments were no worse off than people who took out repayment mortgages. The Consumers' Association welcomed the collapse in endowment sales, which has seen nearly half of the former sellers quit the market over the past 12 months. \"People are now a lot more wary, they understand the risks involved and there is less scope for unscrupulous agents to push endowments,\" said CA spokesman Mick McAteer. Despite the drop in endowments, total sales of life, pensions and savings products grew by 5% in 2000 to reach \u00a353bn, the ABI said. Pension sales, which have been flat in recent years, rose 8% to \u00a31.6bn.",

Labour attacked the Conservative proposal to cut up to \u00a31,000 from the tax bill of married couples where one partner stays at home to look after young children, arguing that 6m out of 7.5m families with children would gain nothing. The Child Poverty Action Group said the measure, which transfers the tax allowance of a non-working to a working spouse, would leave low income and single parent households the losers. The concession, presented by William Hague yesterday as intended to underline his party's support for the institution of marriage, will not apply to married parents who both work, to families with children aged over 11, or to married couples without children. Labour responded to the proposals with a strong defence of its own strategy of directing cash towards families with children, regardless of their parents' marital status. Meanwhile, the trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers, confirmed the government intends to press on with moves to help working parents balance life and work, though with more emphasis on persuasion and incentives than legislation. Labour argues that its policies allow parents the freedom to choose whether to work or not by helping families where one or both parents work, though critics argue it is now financially easier for mothers to look after other people's children than their own. The Conservative proposals, worth \u00a31bn and the latest instalment in the party's promised \u00a38bn package of tax cuts, are being presented by Mr Hague as a new form of the married couple's allowance, abolished by Tony Blair's government. However, the plan falls short of previous promises by the Tory leader and shadow chancellor Michael Portillo to \"restore\" the allowance, thanks to the list of restrictions in eligibility. Critics view the proposal as an uneasy compromise within the party between traditionalists keen to reward marriage - including Mr Hague - and those such as the shadow social security secretary, David Willetts, and Mr Portillo who argue that families with young children should be the greatest beneficiaries. The Conservatives have pledged broadly to maintain Labour's working families tax credit and to keep and increase the new children's tax credit, both of which apply to unmarried as well as married couples. As Labour launched a counter-offensive yesterday, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Smith, rejected suggestions that the Tory plan was a new married couples allowance as \"a fraud... when eight out of 10 married couples gain nothing\". According to government figures, of 5m UK married couples with dependent children, 3.5m will not qualify for the new tax break - either because they both work, their children are over 11, or because the working partner does not earn enough to pay tax. Labour says almost nine out of 10 taxpaying families stand to gain from its new children's tax credit and the working families tax credit, which is paid to both single and double earner couples. Mr Hague told BBC1's Breakfast programme the state should support marriage. \"The evidence is that children do better where parents stay together. People are much more likely to stay together when they are married. It is in the interests of our society, it is in the interests of our country, that most people live in secure and stable marriages.\" Mr Byers, speaking at an Equal Opportunities Commission conference, said a dramatic increase in the number of women with dependent children working meant \"urgent changes\" were needed in the workplace to help working parents.",

      "body": "<p>For 30 years Jim Lyons banked with Barclays and tolerated his treatment at the hands of the \"big bank for the big world\". He stayed, more than anything, because of the difficulty of moving his business - the worry about his salary arriving in the correct account and his direct debits and standing orders being honoured. </p> <p>Now, aged 71, the retired company director is taking the plunge and moving his precious current account to Halifax. It is a momentous decision for Mr Lyons, who has grown weary of his bank closing branches while making big payments to its senior executives. </p> <p>\"I'd been with Barclays over 30 years - a very long time. They were the only bank I'd ever banked with. </p> <p>\"What started me off about moving my account was I read about this new Halifax account but like most people was put off by the hassle. I pay all my regular bills by direct debit. The thought of moving it all put me off,\" Mr Lyons says. </p> <p>He's not alone. Very few customers ever move their bank accounts. Unlike other financial products - particularly mortgages, where one in three homeowners look for a new mortgage each year - just 2% of 30m bank customers move current account in any year. Many keep their account for life while they keep mortgages for an average of just seven years. They even divorce more often. </p> <p>Halifax and Abbey National - along with a handful of internet banks - want to change all that. Millions are being spent on advertising to tackle this inertia and help them grab a share of this profitable market through which they hope to sell more products. </p> <p>The big question the industry is asking, however, is whether these millions are being wasted in a market where the inertia will never be broken. Egg - the online bank majority-owned by the Prudential - thinks that is the case. Paul Gratton, chief executive of an operation which shook up the savings market, admitted this week that it was too tough a market for Egg to crack, even with its considerable resources. </p> <p><strong> The Egg conundrum</strong><br> </p> <p> In his view the big four - Lloyds TSB, Barclays, NatWest and HSBC - have a stranglehold over 70% of the market which will be difficult to loosen. Mr Lyons, as far as Egg is concerned, is not sufficient evidence to the contrary. Yet Mr Lyons has broken free from one of the big four. He wanted to move his Barclays account earlier, and only decided to do so when Halifax promised to do the difficult part of sorting out direct debits and other payments from and to his account. </p> <p>He moved to a bank which does not have a branch in his home town of Bridport, Dorset - even though the Barclays branch from which he is defecting survived the closures last year. </p> <p>The banks insist the hassle factor should no longer deter customers from switching. They can swap direct debit details and other information about accounts - once they have the customer's permission.

      "bodyText": "For 30 years Jim Lyons banked with Barclays and tolerated his treatment at the hands of the \"big bank for the big world\". He stayed, more than anything, because of the difficulty of moving his business - the worry about his salary arriving in the correct account and his direct debits and standing orders being honoured. Now, aged 71, the retired company director is taking the plunge and moving his precious current account to Halifax. It is a momentous decision for Mr Lyons, who has grown weary of his bank closing branches while making big payments to its senior executives. \"I'd been with Barclays over 30 years - a very long time. They were the only bank I'd ever banked with. \"What started me off about moving my account was I read about this new Halifax account but like most people was put off by the hassle. I pay all my regular bills by direct debit. The thought of moving it all put me off,\" Mr Lyons says. He's not alone. Very few customers ever move their bank accounts. Unlike other financial products - particularly mortgages, where one in three homeowners look for a new mortgage each year - just 2% of 30m bank customers move current account in any year. Many keep their account for life while they keep mortgages for an average of just seven years. They even divorce more often. Halifax and Abbey National - along with a handful of internet banks - want to change all that. Millions are being spent on advertising to tackle this inertia and help them grab a share of this profitable market through which they hope to sell more products. The big question the industry is asking, however, is whether these millions are being wasted in a market where the inertia will never be broken. Egg - the online bank majority-owned by the Prudential - thinks that is the case. Paul Gratton, chief executive of an operation which shook up the savings market, admitted this week that it was too tough a market for Egg to crack, even with its considerable resources. The Egg conundrum In his view the big four - Lloyds TSB, Barclays, NatWest and HSBC - have a stranglehold over 70% of the market which will be difficult to loosen. Mr Lyons, as far as Egg is concerned, is not sufficient evidence to the contrary. Yet Mr Lyons has broken free from one of the big four. He wanted to move his Barclays account earlier, and only decided to do so when Halifax promised to do the difficult part of sorting out direct debits and other payments from and to his account. He moved to a bank which does not have a branch in his home town of Bridport, Dorset - even though the Barclays branch from which he is defecting survived the closures last year. The banks insist the hassle factor should no longer deter customers from switching. They can swap direct debit details and other information about accounts - once they have the customer's permission. The process still takes a minimum of six weeks to complete, a factor acknowledged by Abbey National as deterring people who might be thinking about moving. \"It's still proving quite a hard battle to get people to switch,\" said Andrew Pople, the managing director of retail banking. Abbey National also claims that the big four are not playing fair, and are holding on to their dominant position by failing to comply with the industry-wide agreement to swap all the information within 10 days. \"Small minded,\" is how one executive described it. Some industry experts believe that the new entrants are trying to blame the big players because the real reason for the inertia is not the difficulty of transferring accounts. They argue that customers need to be convinced they will be better off if they move, as they do when they remortgage their house or shift their savings to providers offering higher rates. This means that even Halifax's promise of 4% interest on balances - 40 times more than any of the big four - or Abbey's pledge to stop overdraft charges for a year, could have little impact.

Contrast that with a 1% reduction in the rate achieved by remortgaging a \u00a360,000 loan, where a homeowner could be \u00a350 a month better off. According to Stuart Cliffe, the chief executive of the National Association of Bank and Insurance Customers, another reason for this inertia is the historically privileged position of banks in this country - as recently as two decades ago having a bank account was only just becoming the norm. \"We keep encouraging people to change banks as they would supermarkets if they see a better price,\" said Mr Cliffe, a man with plenty of evidence of bank blunders. Even he holds out little hope that moving will become as common as chasing the highest interest rate for savings or the lowest rate for loans and mortgages. \"There's an underlying belief that financial services is so difficult and banks so socially exclusive that customers feel happy that've got one relationship with one bank,\" Mr Cliffe said.

Given the intimacy of the National's Cottesloe theatre, why not revive less familiar Synge plays such as the brilliant, Beckettian Well of the Saints or even that strange romantic saga, Deirdre of the Sorrows? </p> <p>The sense of deja vu is confirmed by Fiona Buffini's production which, in interpretative terms, is very similar to that by Lynne Parker at the Almeida seven years ago. Historically the play was seen as a robust satire on a peasant community's romantic attitude to violence and murder - and highly offensive to its 1907 audience. But Buffini, like Parker, views the play as a rural tragedy about loneliness. Both Christy Mahon, the presumed father-slayer, and Pegeen Mike, the publican's daughter, are motherless solitaries magnetically drawn to each other. The difference is that Christy, liberated by the initial hero-worship and a second assault on his father, becomes a new man, while Pegeen, having helped to transform Christy, is left to face a life of unrelieved misery. </p> <p>It is a perfectly valid reading, one that brings out the play's mythic, as opposed to purely parochial, quality. But, in single-mindedly pursuing it, Buffini neglects both Synge's comedy and his prose-poetry. Pegeen's final grief is greater if it emerges from a cumulative background of laughter; but here even surefire moments such as the arrival of Christy's supposedly dead father go for little. In seeking to avoid melodious Synge-song Buffini also damps down the artfully cadenced prose - wrongly so, since one of the qualities that attracts Pegeen to Christy is his fanciful gift of the gab. </p> <p>On the positive side, Derbhle Crotty is an outstandingly good Pegeen Mike. Right from the start, keys forever dangling at her waist, she suggests a life of doleful drudgery made worse by the prospect of marriage to a priest-ridden coward. Crotty expresses a habituated solitude briefly illuminated by Christy's arrival; she also subtly implies she is prepared to tolerate his yarn-spinning for the sake of his masculine assurance. </p> <p>It is a finely calibrated performance - her final disillusion is genuinely unnerving - and she is decently partnered by Patrick O'Kane as Christy. He is nothing like \"the queer, low fellow\" the text suggests, but he effectively conveys Christy's growth - if such it be - from furtive fugitive to a man of truly violent authority. Sorcha Cusack as the predatory Widow Quinn and John Rogan as Pegeen's exploitative father lend staunch support, and Robert Jones's set is all shebeen-roughness and smoky turf-fires. But although the rural realism is faithfully done there is an extravagant wildness to Synge's tragicomedy that eludes this sombre production. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep. Box office: 020-7452 3000. </p>",

Both Christy Mahon, the presumed father-slayer, and Pegeen Mike, the publican's daughter, are motherless solitaries magnetically drawn to each other. The difference is that Christy, liberated by the initial hero-worship and a second assault on his father, becomes a new man, while Pegeen, having helped to transform Christy, is left to face a life of unrelieved misery. It is a perfectly valid reading, one that brings out the play's mythic, as opposed to purely parochial, quality. But, in single-mindedly pursuing it, Buffini neglects both Synge's comedy and his prose-poetry. Pegeen's final grief is greater if it emerges from a cumulative background of laughter; but here even surefire moments such as the arrival of Christy's supposedly dead father go for little. In seeking to avoid melodious Synge-song Buffini also damps down the artfully cadenced prose - wrongly so, since one of the qualities that attracts Pegeen to Christy is his fanciful gift of the gab. On the positive side, Derbhle Crotty is an outstandingly good Pegeen Mike. Right from the start, keys forever dangling at her waist, she suggests a life of doleful drudgery made worse by the prospect of marriage to a priest-ridden coward. Crotty expresses a habituated solitude briefly illuminated by Christy's arrival; she also subtly implies she is prepared to tolerate his yarn-spinning for the sake of his masculine assurance. It is a finely calibrated performance - her final disillusion is genuinely unnerving - and she is decently partnered by Patrick O'Kane as Christy. He is nothing like \"the queer, low fellow\" the text suggests, but he effectively conveys Christy's growth - if such it be - from furtive fugitive to a man of truly violent authority. Sorcha Cusack as the predatory Widow Quinn and John Rogan as Pegeen's exploitative father lend staunch support, and Robert Jones's set is all shebeen-roughness and smoky turf-fires. But although the rural realism is faithfully done there is an extravagant wildness to Synge's tragicomedy that eludes this sombre production. \u0095 In rep. Box office: 020-7452 3000.",
