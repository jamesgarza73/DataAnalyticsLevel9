      "body": "<p>Dozens of angry supporters of President Robert Mugabe yesterday invaded the 6,000-acre cattle ranch of Zimbabwe's last white ruler, the stubborn and outspoken Ian Smith.</p> <p>The occupation comes on the eve of a visit to Zimbabwe by the Commonwealth secretary-general Don McKinnon, who is expected to deliver a stern warning to Mr Mugabe about his continuing oppression of white farmers and the political opposition.</p> <p>About 50 government supporters are now occupying Mr Smith's Gwenoro farm near the southern town of Shurugwe, 200 miles southeast of Harare.</p> <p>Mr Smith, now 81, who led white-ruled Rhodesia throughout the 1960s and 1970s, played down the incident. He said he did not think squatters were targeting his farm because of his past opposition to Mr Mugabe. \"No, they all love me. I've got more black friends than Mugabe at present.\"</p> <p>He made light of the occupation. \"It's just a few old timers from Shurugwe who are out of work,\" said Mr Smith from his Harare home. \"I don't expect trouble. I've got a peaceful farm and there's no politics on the farm.\" But later in the day Mr Smith left for the farm, which is run by a manager.</p> <p>Since Zimbabwe became independent in 1980, Mr Smith has lived peacefully in the country. Last month he suggested that he might run for parliament again to voice his opposition to Mr Mugabe's government and the recent collapse of law and order. Since February Mr Mugabe's supporters have invaded more than 1,200 white-owned farms, killed more than 20 opposition members, and beaten and tortured thousands of black opposition supporters.</p> <p>Mr McKinnon arrives in Harare today as the violence shows no sign of abating.</p> <p>Farmer John Weeks died in hospital yesterday after being shot when his farm, in the Beatrice area 40 miles south of Harare, was attacked on Thursday evening. Mr Weeks was shot a few miles away from where farmer Alan Dunn was bludgeoned to death by Mr Mugabe's supporters a week ago.</p> <p>Mr Weeks' death brings to four the number of white farmers killed in the past six weeks. Sixteen black members of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), have been killed by government supporters during the same period.</p> <p>Beatrice farmers say the area is teeming with militant veterans of the war against Rhodesian rule and other government supporters. Several white farmers have received death threats and hundreds of black farm labourers have been beaten for supporting the MDC.</p> <p>The wave of violence is being promoted by Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party in an effort to stamp out widespread support for the MDC before parliamentary elections, expected in July.</p> <p>Mr McKinnon will see if the Commonwealth can field observers in the polls.</p> <p>Opposition leaders and human rights activists say the government-sponsored violence against the MDC has already made free and fair polls impossible. \"Thousands of Zimbabweans have been tortured by government agents, most in public settings which traumatises those that see the violence as well as those that experience it,\" said Tony Reeler, director of Amani Trust, which counsels victims of violence.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, yesterday warned Mr Mugabe against expelling whites from the country.\"It would be an enormous mistake for Zimbabwe to attempt to expel British citizens with resident qualifications because they provide the backbone for so much of the exports of Zimbabwe in the agricultural sector,\" he told BBC television.</p> <p>His comments followed Zimbabwe's decision to order British nationals who have dual citizenship to surrender their Zimbabwean passports.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dozens of angry supporters of President Robert Mugabe yesterday invaded the 6,000-acre cattle ranch of Zimbabwe's last white ruler, the stubborn and outspoken Ian Smith. The occupation comes on the eve of a visit to Zimbabwe by the Commonwealth secretary-general Don McKinnon, who is expected to deliver a stern warning to Mr Mugabe about his continuing oppression of white farmers and the political opposition. About 50 government supporters are now occupying Mr Smith's Gwenoro farm near the southern town of Shurugwe, 200 miles southeast of Harare. Mr Smith, now 81, who led white-ruled Rhodesia throughout the 1960s and 1970s, played down the incident. He said he did not think squatters were targeting his farm because of his past opposition to Mr Mugabe. \"No, they all love me. I've got more black friends than Mugabe at present.\" He made light of the occupation. \"It's just a few old timers from Shurugwe who are out of work,\" said Mr Smith from his Harare home. \"I don't expect trouble. I've got a peaceful farm and there's no politics on the farm.\" But later in the day Mr Smith left for the farm, which is run by a manager. Since Zimbabwe became independent in 1980, Mr Smith has lived peacefully in the country. Last month he suggested that he might run for parliament again to voice his opposition to Mr Mugabe's government and the recent collapse of law and order. Since February Mr Mugabe's supporters have invaded more than 1,200 white-owned farms, killed more than 20 opposition members, and beaten and tortured thousands of black opposition supporters. Mr McKinnon arrives in Harare today as the violence shows no sign of abating. Farmer John Weeks died in hospital yesterday after being shot when his farm, in the Beatrice area 40 miles south of Harare, was attacked on Thursday evening. Mr Weeks was shot a few miles away from where farmer Alan Dunn was bludgeoned to death by Mr Mugabe's supporters a week ago. Mr Weeks' death brings to four the number of white farmers killed in the past six weeks. Sixteen black members of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), have been killed by government supporters during the same period. Beatrice farmers say the area is teeming with militant veterans of the war against Rhodesian rule and other government supporters. Several white farmers have received death threats and hundreds of black farm labourers have been beaten for supporting the MDC. The wave of violence is being promoted by Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party in an effort to stamp out widespread support for the MDC before parliamentary elections, expected in July. Mr McKinnon will see if the Commonwealth can field observers in the polls. Opposition leaders and human rights activists say the government-sponsored violence against the MDC has already made free and fair polls impossible. \"Thousands of Zimbabweans have been tortured by government agents, most in public settings which traumatises those that see the violence as well as those that experience it,\" said Tony Reeler, director of Amani Trust, which counsels victims of violence. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, yesterday warned Mr Mugabe against expelling whites from the country.\"It would be an enormous mistake for Zimbabwe to attempt to expel British citizens with resident qualifications because they provide the backbone for so much of the exports of Zimbabwe in the agricultural sector,\" he told BBC television. His comments followed Zimbabwe's decision to order British nationals who have dual citizenship to surrender their Zimbabwean passports.",

      "body": "<p>The Conservatives yesterday stepped up their new offensive on law and order when they unexpectedly endorsed plans to breach the \"double jeopardy\" rule and allow acquitted suspects to be tried a second time in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>It prompted indignant Labour cries of \"knee-jerk headline seeking\", and of bandwagon populism, because - as shadow ministers admit - the Tory move follows a similar recommendation by the Macpherson committee which investigated the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence. It also anticipates an expected recommendation by the law commission, due next year.</p> <p>When Sir William Macpherson made his proposal in February 1999, the then-shadow home secretary, Sir Norman Fowler, warned against the dangers of \"legislating in anger\" - a reference to the fact that three of the young men suspected of stabbing Lawrence in 1993 cannot face trial again because they were acquitted of murder in a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family in 1996.</p> <p>But the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, who trailed the shift on television yesterday ahead of William Hague's assault on the \"liberal establishment\" before the Police Federation on Thursday, refused to be apologetic.</p> <p>\"What of course people really mean when they say we are being populist is that we are responding to people's concerns,\" she said on GMTV. Stressing that only a few cases would be affected by the change in the rule, she added: \"I am not here talking about massive numbers of retrials - heaven forbid.\"</p> <p>Mr Hague plans to promise that a Tory government will stand for \"more Pcs and less PC - as in politically correct. He is already claiming that his tough talk on law and order, as well as the asylum controversy, lies behind Labour's drop in the opinion polls this month.

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives yesterday stepped up their new offensive on law and order when they unexpectedly endorsed plans to breach the \"double jeopardy\" rule and allow acquitted suspects to be tried a second time in exceptional circumstances. It prompted indignant Labour cries of \"knee-jerk headline seeking\", and of bandwagon populism, because - as shadow ministers admit - the Tory move follows a similar recommendation by the Macpherson committee which investigated the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence. It also anticipates an expected recommendation by the law commission, due next year. When Sir William Macpherson made his proposal in February 1999, the then-shadow home secretary, Sir Norman Fowler, warned against the dangers of \"legislating in anger\" - a reference to the fact that three of the young men suspected of stabbing Lawrence in 1993 cannot face trial again because they were acquitted of murder in a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family in 1996. But the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, who trailed the shift on television yesterday ahead of William Hague's assault on the \"liberal establishment\" before the Police Federation on Thursday, refused to be apologetic. \"What of course people really mean when they say we are being populist is that we are responding to people's concerns,\" she said on GMTV. Stressing that only a few cases would be affected by the change in the rule, she added: \"I am not here talking about massive numbers of retrials - heaven forbid.\" Mr Hague plans to promise that a Tory government will stand for \"more Pcs and less PC - as in politically correct. He is already claiming that his tough talk on law and order, as well as the asylum controversy, lies behind Labour's drop in the opinion polls this month. Both private Tory polling and a Gallup poll registered a 3% fall in support for Labour. The Gallup poll for last Friday's Daily Telegraph still put Labour ahead, at 47% to 31%, twice the 43% to 35% lead recorded in ICM's private poll for the Tories, but both suggest an anti-government shift. Paul Boateng, Jack Straw's Home Office deputy, complained: \"William Hague's knee-jerk headline seeking is yet another example of his poor judgment. The government accepted the Macpherson report recommendation to consider this issue. \"The law commission is giving very careful consideration to this issue. That is the right way to deal with this important and sensitive matter.\" A bill is expected next year, but it will not be retrospective. That means that the three Lawrence suspects who were acquitted four years ago will not be caught by the new law. As in several dramatic breakthroughs involving long unsolved cases, the most likely kind of substantial new evidence is expected to come from rapidly-expanding techniques for tracing DNA from clothing and other items. The row prompted John Wadham, director of the leading civil rights group Liberty, to dismiss it as \"macho\" party politics. \"The protection from double jeopardy is a fundamental part of our criminal justice system and we remove it at our peril,\" he said after Tory officials confirmed the policy shift. \"Innocent people should not have to face one trial, be locked up for months at a time and then go through the whole thing again before they are finally acquitted.\" But David Winnick, a Labour member of the Commons home affairs select committee, said that there was \"undoubtedly an argument\" for such a change, providing adequate safeguards were in place. Ministers expect that the law commission will confirm the interim endorsement of the change which it made last year before it was put out to wider consultation. They point to the breach in the double jeopardy principle made by the Tories, with Labour support, in 1986 when the then home secretary, Michael Howard, permitted a second trial if jury tampering was later unearthed.

A European computer system, developed by the Dutch and at present confined to tracing stolen vehicles, is soon to be expanded to include verification of licences - enabling authorities abroad to find out previous offences committed by the motorist. The Irish Republic is going one stage further by introducing a \"penalty points\" system identical to that of the United Kingdom and allowing instant action by the Garda against motorists breaking the law. The European-wide system would mean a UK driver caught speeding, for example, by foreign police could be banned from driving in that country if a licence check showed the driver was already on the verge of a points ban. In the case of a tourist driving in the Republic, offences would lead to penalty points being imposed and those points being binding on the motorist's UK licence. The computer system, the European car and driving licence information system or Eucaris, operates in Britain, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxemburg, but is being expanded under bilateral agreements across the European Union. Seven other member states are negotiating to be included and the Irish Republic is examining the conversion of its driver, vehicle and police files so it can be aligned with the system.

Mr Milburn, who has said that he wanted to end demarcation between health professionals, would be more than willing to take on board the team's thinking, but there is bound to be opposition to what Ms Hargadon said was lateral thinking - and others will see as diluting professionalism. Although nurse practitioners now work alongside GPs in some areas, there has long been a schism between the professions based on such factors as education, earning power and gender. But Ms Hargadon believes the barriers are coming down. \"There are wonderful examples of nurses and doctors working together incredibly well, much more than when I joined the NHS 20 years or so ago,\" she said. In interviews with researchers, many health professionals complained about the rigidities of training. \"It causes some job dissatisfaction,\" said Ms Hargadon. \"People are only interested in barriers and divides when they feel threatened by a change. This change offers so much for people.\"",

The Million Mom March was focused on the capital, where a huge crowd of women, along with large numbers of men and children, gathered to mark Mothers' Day on the Mall, the green strip which leads to the Capitol building housing Congress. At the other end, below the Washington Monument, about 2,000 people calling themselves the Armed Informed Mothers staged a counter-protest against gun control. President Clinton threw his weight behind the Million Mom March, holding a morning reception on the lawn of the White House for the rally's leaders and the mothers of children killed by guns. \"One of the things your mother teaches you when you grow up is that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" he told the crowd.

      "bodyText": "The man appointed to one of the hottest seats in British journalism last night surmounted his first important hurdle when the main political parties agreed that Andrew Marr is \"straight\" enough to become the BBC's new political editor. The columnist for the Observer and the Daily Express is a former writer and, briefly, editor of the Independent. But, despite its recent skirmishes with the BBC, the Conservative leadership called the dogs off, at least for now. \"We know Andrew. He is a distinguished journalist and we have no doubt he will continue the BBC tradition of unbiased reporting,\" said a party spokesman. News that Robin Oakley, the BBC's political editor since 1992, is to step down a year earlier than expected, caught TV insiders by surprise. It is a sign that Greg Dyke's new regime is gearing up to fight for viewers during the coming general election - which Mr Oakley had intended to cover before his retirement at 60 - rather than a political signal. It will leave a number of potential contenders feeling sore. John Sergeant, 55, Mr Oakley's deputy whom he beat for the top job, recently took over as political editor of ITN, though the BBC was in negotiation with Mr Marr before he left. Well-regarded younger BBC political reporters like Mark Mardell, Nick Robinson and Huw Edwards - who reads the Six O'Clock News - will also have to wait longer for their chance at what is one of the most visible and relentless jobs in journalism which has again gone to a recruit from the national press. Mr Oakley, who writes a racing column for the Spectator, also came from print journalism, as political editor of both the Daily Mail and the Times. As Labour and the Liberal Democrats signalled their approval of Mr Marr, a Cambridge-educated wunderkind who has also worked for the Scotsman and the Economist - he is still only 40 - another Tory called him \"very straight\". That epithet was applied during the long tenure in the post of John Cole, another man of the left who came to the BBC from the Observer and proved both popular with viewers and respected by politicians. Mr Marr bracketed him and Mr Oakley together as reporters who could provide the independence of mind required by the BBC's charter obligations. \"In each case they demonstrated that they were straight and impartial and they were trusted quickly. If I can do as well as them, I will be delighted, \" he said on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost. He also dismissed talk of \"supposed New Labour sympathies\", having voted for most parties, including the SNP and the Tories at various stages of his civic development. It did not stop the former Tory chairman, Lord Tebbit, making a predictable attack. \"The BBC is run by the Labour party and takes its orders from it, so this will make no difference,\" he said. Some new BBC colleagues posed a different question: why would the cerebral Mr Marr, who has turned down a lucrative opening in internet journalism, want such a treadmill job when both devolution and closer European integration (both causes which the pre-BBC Marr backed) have undermined Westminster's place at the centre of events? \"Marr tries to bring a bit of hinterland to his writing - literature, the arts and a few jokes.

Whitehall, flourishing action plans, duly performs its ritual dance.

Would he buy a phone for his own grandchildren, aged two and four? No, he would not. Confusion reigns.</p> <p>The trouble, of course, comes where the worlds of science and non-science meet. There are plenty of reasons why parents should worry about the 4m or more mobiles in the hands of under-18s. Reasons like paying the bill - or social stunting. (I was sitting in a cafe the other day watching, with fascination, four boys and four girls round a table: the boys were talking football, the girls - sitting back - were sending text messages to each other on their mobiles). There is obvious danger when you drive with one hand and answer a phone with the other. Transmission masts can mean aesthetic blight. But you don't need science to tell you that. Commonsense will do.</p> <p>Here's another example of mission creep. We're alarmed about mobiles and health. We ask a team of eminent scientists to examine our fears. It finds them (insofar as science ever makes possible) to be groundless. Yet the process, both human and political, doesn't stop there. We can't take \"no evident risk\" for an answer. We always want more; and thus science itself turns into non-science, and there is no rational reassurance.</p> <p>That is a very unsteady state to find yourself in. A land of mad cows and Frankenstein foods where hysteria rules and paranoia always lurks in the undergrowth: a land where nothing and nobody, no matter how expert, can be trusted. Thus is the shambles of BSE visited on genetic modification in terms of national angst, sealed in futility behind porous borders.</p> <p>Pseudo-science, moreover, has a nasty habit of reaching into every walk of life and infecting every debate. Take (from the adjacent moral, rather than physical, pot of the moment) televised sex. There is a lot of it about. Even souls as hardy as Jonathan Freedland are alarmed. It won't be long, I guess, before Chris Smith turns his attention from News at Ten to Soft-Porn at Eleven and television's watchdogs chunter into action. More national rot.</p> <p>Yet any suitably clinical look will reveal a rather different story. A fondness for eroticism - carved on the walls of Ancient Greece - is an enduring part of the human psyche. A market for it exists, and has always existed, everywhere in the world. In America, that market currently accounts for around $4bn a year. On television, some countries where cable is ubiquitous limit it to defined, easily accessible channels. Others - like France - let national channels carry prescribed doses of the hard stuff.</p> <p>Britain's main regular outlet - Mr Kelvin Mackenzie's L!ve TV - went belly-up months ago. Not enough viewers or cash. But that left a footloose audience roaming the airwaves. Channel 5 has picked up a bit of it. Channel 4 has followed suit. What was spread thick in one area a couple of years ago is now spread more thinly across several. It will continue to be so until (a) a new or existing channel corners the porn market more determinedly or (b) until the market for tired documentaries about tired strippers wanes.</p> <p>Put a team of media analysts and social scientists together and they would soon calm your fears. They would create a cool climate of contextualisation. But we seem to have lost the ability to summon such coolness or such trust. Tony Blair may have brought back royal commissions after a long absence; he hasn't managed to recreate an audience of a mind to listen to them.</p> <p>Back to the mobile arena, where facts go even further. Do mobiles heat the brain? Yes, by one tenth as much as a spell of sunbathing. Drinking a cup of coffee or walking the dog would be just as perilous. You can compute the danger of dying in a road accident over a period of 70 years at far less than one in a hundred, but the risks here are too infinitesimal to be worth computing. There are risks; there are always risks. Living is a risky business which ends in death. Mankind is prey to sudden awful viruses, and vigilance is always necessary. Smoking does damage your health. Pesticides can poison the water.</p> <p>But living is also a matter for reasonable inquiry, reasonable doubt and reasonable conclusions. When we call in the experts, we should expect no more than the best tools for risk assessment. Sir William Stewart gives us those tools. It would have been better if he'd stopped there, in brevity and prudent clarity. There's never (as the lofty guy from the US Health Department might say) been a better moment to start redrawing the lines between what science can do for us and what it can't. When there is nothing sensible to be done, it's best not to do it.</p> <p>peter.preston@theguardian.com</p>",

It won't be long, I guess, before Chris Smith turns his attention from News at Ten to Soft-Porn at Eleven and television's watchdogs chunter into action. More national rot. Yet any suitably clinical look will reveal a rather different story. A fondness for eroticism - carved on the walls of Ancient Greece - is an enduring part of the human psyche. A market for it exists, and has always existed, everywhere in the world. In America, that market currently accounts for around $4bn a year. On television, some countries where cable is ubiquitous limit it to defined, easily accessible channels. Others - like France - let national channels carry prescribed doses of the hard stuff. Britain's main regular outlet - Mr Kelvin Mackenzie's L!ve TV - went belly-up months ago. Not enough viewers or cash. But that left a footloose audience roaming the airwaves. Channel 5 has picked up a bit of it. Channel 4 has followed suit. What was spread thick in one area a couple of years ago is now spread more thinly across several. It will continue to be so until (a) a new or existing channel corners the porn market more determinedly or (b) until the market for tired documentaries about tired strippers wanes. Put a team of media analysts and social scientists together and they would soon calm your fears. They would create a cool climate of contextualisation. But we seem to have lost the ability to summon such coolness or such trust. Tony Blair may have brought back royal commissions after a long absence; he hasn't managed to recreate an audience of a mind to listen to them. Back to the mobile arena, where facts go even further. Do mobiles heat the brain? Yes, by one tenth as much as a spell of sunbathing. Drinking a cup of coffee or walking the dog would be just as perilous. You can compute the danger of dying in a road accident over a period of 70 years at far less than one in a hundred, but the risks here are too infinitesimal to be worth computing. There are risks; there are always risks. Living is a risky business which ends in death. Mankind is prey to sudden awful viruses, and vigilance is always necessary. Smoking does damage your health. Pesticides can poison the water. But living is also a matter for reasonable inquiry, reasonable doubt and reasonable conclusions. When we call in the experts, we should expect no more than the best tools for risk assessment. Sir William Stewart gives us those tools. It would have been better if he'd stopped there, in brevity and prudent clarity. There's never (as the lofty guy from the US Health Department might say) been a better moment to start redrawing the lines between what science can do for us and what it can't. When there is nothing sensible to be done, it's best not to do it. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

Producers are champing at the bit to match commercial radio's offerings, says online head Simon Nelson. </p> <p>While you can chat online with the stars on Radio 1 or win a car or \u00a320,000 online with Virgin Radio, an invitation to \"email us with your questions and comments\" is about as far as some speech programmes have tended to go. But the shift into directing Radio 4 listeners to websites is under way. </p> <p>The move comes as the radio industry cheerily savours the heady fact that it could be a \"net winner\": radio may be the medium least likely to be hit by the growth in surfing, because radio listening is a complementary activity. You can listen to music, a phone-in or a play while doing DIY, or composing an email. Even though sound quality has yet to match the best radio reception (this is being worked on), you can access stations pretty simply over the web, too. </p> <p>Virgin Radio, one of the first to webcast in 1996, now has more than 200,000 listeners accessing its services online. Just as breakfast audiences boomed when car-commuting increased in the 1970s - coinciding with the infancy of commercial radio in the UK - the hope now is that the rise of internet usage will produce a rise in radio listening at other \"down\" times outside office hours. </p> <p>Jason Bryant, of talkSport, says this has already happened in the US. \"Radio is a natural bedfellow of the dot.com user, and weekends and evenings are times of high usage. Radio allows you to listen and surf at the same time. At 11.30pm last night I was listening to a sports station in LA.\" </p> <p>The subject stole the headlines last week when Rajar, the radio audience research company, began publishing regular information on how radio listeners (that's 90% of the population) use the internet, based on its 30,000-strong database. </p> <p>It found that while one in three adults claimed some use of the web, however infrequent, radio users were slightly more likely to. But the really striking finding is that young men and upmarket households of under-44s are the most \"techy\". Some 11% of young men aged 15-24 listened to radio via the web, compared to 3.3% of the population overall. A quarter of 15-24 year old males had visited a radio website - Capital, Virgin and Chrysalis are seen as well advanced - compared with 14% of women in same age band and 8% generally. </p> <p>Another finding was that while people do surf at work, more use it at home, when radio is a natural accompaniment. The figures are: home use 18.9%; work 10.5%; school/college 5.4%; cyber cafe 1%, and elsewhere 3.8%. But there are worrying public policy indications in the research, which Justin Sampson, managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, was quick to point out. </p> <p>First, the stark social divide. Rajar found that 35.5% of well-heeled ABC1s accessed it at least once a week, compared with 13.6% of C2DEs. As Sampson says, this puts a question mark against the prime minister's goal of universal access within five years: \"How can Tony Blair's vision of a wired-up society be achieved?\" </p> <p>One answer is that the most obvious entry barrier - the several hundred pounds required to set yourself up - will become less prohibitive as computer prices fall. Another lies in the falling cost of calls. Fear of large phone bills deters poorer households. </p> <p>This is a factor identified by the radio sector as holding back broadcasting over the web: although some 3,500 radio stations worldwide webcast their services, listeners here are bound to ask why they should stack up call costs for nationally available services when they can get them free over the air. But this is where Nelson scents an opportunity for the public service BBC: he sees the 15m middle-aged listeners to Radio 2 and Radio 4 (\"most of this audience are desperate to get involved\") as potential \"silver surfers\". </p> <p>Nelson says BBC radio staff face the prospect of swift re-training, to get radio producers used to adapting to the web. \"I've found every producer seems to be screaming to get into this. We're trying to learn and build for the future, not just catch up.\" Of course there is an element of hype in all of this. With commercial radio networks achieving sky-high share prices, the dot.com link is a useful bit of extra spice. But the potential is real enough. </p> <p>A survey by Ocean Consulting of the UK's media agencies published last week by Media Week confirmed their belief that radio had by far the most to gain from the internet, outstripping TV, magazines and newspapers. Radio is already an ally of isolated commuters stuck in jams. It is equally well suited to act as a friendly presence for isolated home workers, chained to a computer. And who knows how the online interactive dimension will start to change the character of the broadcast output? </p> <p>John Ousby, head of online for Virgin Radio, says: \"Radio production values are never going to die. A radio station is more than a collection of songs.

But we're not going to turn our back on the ability to find out what the audience wants more of. Let's get it in perspective. The number of people tuning in in this way is still small.

While bailiffs are supposed to hold certificates for claiming rent, road traffic penalties and council tax, the system is far from rigorous, and no certificates are needed to reclaim magistrates' fines, it says. \"Theoretically, these bailiffs are supposed to be independently monitored and controlled, but this doesn't happen,\" said Alison Green, its author. \"Where no certificates are required, the bailiff is not subject to checks or regulations of any kind.\" Statutes dating from 1267 also created a legal minefield and ensured bailiffs had the right to do things such as break into someone's home and assert the right to take goods. They could effectively charge what they liked. \"They are permitted to charge 'reasonable costs' for taking away goods. But there are no rules for what these are, and in practice people do not contest them since this involves going to the county court which costs more money,\" Ms Green said. The report, Undue Distress, argues that there are fairer ways of recovering domestic debt, such as direct deductions from benefit. Calling for the system to be scrapped, it says the government's social exclusion unit should examine the issue of debt and debt enforcement. David Harker, Nacab's chief executive, said: \"It is high time we moved away from a system that relies on intimidation and confusion as its main tools to one that is sensitive to the situation of those who struggle on inadequate incomes.\"",

      "bodyText": "More than a third of days taken off work through illness have nothing to do with ill health, a survey published today shows. The average worker takes three sick days off a year when they are perfectly healthy, at a cost of over \u00a34bn to industry, according to the study by the Institute of Personnel and Development. It found the most common reasons given for absenteeism through illness were minor complaints such as colds and headaches. For non-manual workers, the second most cited reason was stress; for manual workers it was back pain. On average, the annual cost of sick days is almost \u00a3500 for each employee, or at least \u00a313bn to the British economy. The study of almost 1,700 organisations, employing a total of just under 2m staff, said the main reasons given by employers for increases in sickness absence were changes in workforce morale and workload. The average level of sickness absence was 4.1% of working time - the equivalent of 9.3 lost working days - with the highest levels in larger organisations, including the NHS. About 90% of employers see sickness absence as \"a significant or very significant\" cost to their business. Diane Sinclair, who carried out the survey, said: \"Sickness absence costs the UK economy a vast amount each year. \"A conservative estimate is \u00a3485.60 for each employee each year. Organisations which have poor management, low morale and increased work pressures will see their employees take increasing amounts of time off as sick leave.\" But a third of employers believe that the level of absenteeism in their organisations has decreased over the past two years, compared with a fifth who claim to have seen an increase. Meanwhile, more than 90% of larger companies with a staff of over 2,000 have a written policy on sick days and 80% of respondents said they liked to interview workers on their return to work. The priority that is being given to flexible working practices such as job-sharing, flexi-time and self-management was felt by a third of respondents to have been effective in reducing time off through sickness. Ms Sinclair said: \"With around one sick leave day in every three being taken for reasons other than illness, employers clearly need to focus on people management and development strategies in order to tackle absence. \"Direct approaches such as return-to-work interviews and proper record keeping are important. \"And more flexible, family-friendly policies are likely to be key to achieving this goal.\"",

      "body": "<p>Ever since the information started leaking out that Open, the Sky-owned interactive shopping TV channel, was actually proving a success, it has been hard to avoid Interactive television, iTV, or idTV. Not a week passes without some new announcement: first Granada Media Group, followed by cable comapny NTL, announced they will be offering internet access through TV, then YesTV goes for early flotation, and last week Carlton unveiled a new commerce-based service, Carlton Active, on the same day Open released its first user data. </p> <p>The clash in Britain is not a head-to-head between the PC and the TV as it is in America (in the UK penetration of TVs is 97% whereas PC penetration is likely to drop off at 50%) but a pitched battle over which platforms will control the \"dumb\" grey box in the corner, which is growing less dumb by the day. </p> <p>Media, telephone and cable companies and ISPs are all trying to exploit the potential of broadband - increased bandwidth which will allow extra services through TV such as internet access, enhanced television, television-commerce, programming and video-on-demand. There are three, potentially four, competing platforms: digital satellite (DST), digital cable, digital terrestrial (DTT) and ADSL or broadband through the phoneline; it is anyone's guess which one will dominate. </p> <p>ONdigital, the DTT service, makes it sound perfectly simple. In five years, when the plug is pulled on analogue, Andrew Marre, head of communications, says there is \"no question\" that DTT will be supreme. \"In the long run we are expecting DTT with free-to-air services in every house in the country.\" </p> <p>Not all of them will be ONdigital users, of course. The subscription service shares the 24-year government granted DTT licence with the free to air channels BBC, ITV and C4 and with SDN, a commercial pay-per-view multiplex. Marre believes his satellite rival in the shape of Sky, and its service Open, has shot itself in the foot: \"Open has a walled garden with 20 to 30 sites and therefore limited content providers. It has HSBC and Abbey National on board, for example, but what happens if you bank with Barclays?\" </p> <p>ONdigital has only around 600,000 subscribers, however, whereas Open's reach last month was 3.3m and its email through the television accounts alone are used by 750,000. They aim to increase this to 5m by the end of the year and increase penetration to one in four homes. But the latest news which really will have service providers salivating is that 10% of Open households have bought something through the service - far better figures than e-commerce through the PC. </p> <p>\"People are always trying to trash Open,\" says Ricardo Teller, Open's spokesman. \"But we already have the advantage and ONdigital is desperate to get in.\" Open has a set top box which operates at 28.8 bits per second, whereas ONdigital's can only manage 2.2bps, making internet access painfully slow. DST can also physically cover more of the country and whole chunks of Europe. </p> <p>In many ways, it is futile trying to compare the services at this early stage, though Carlton Active has launched by promoting the idea of the \"internet on TV\" to make it attractive to interactive advertisers. </p> <p>The user experience in Open is not \"the poor man's internet\" according to Teller: \"We do not believe people are looking for that through their TV screens - it is somewhere between the turn off box [the TV] and the turn on box [the PC].\" It is essentially that of the shopping mall, where the customer is entertained constantly. They can play a computer game while waiting for the machine to compare prices on water beds and then, feeling peckish after all that virtual strolling, you can order a pizza. </p> <p>\"Right now, no company is even close to second to Open,\" says Teller. \"It is impossible for the others to catch up because of our technological advantage. The real battle is between ONdigital and cable companies - by the time the cable companies get round to launching a serious product, it will be too late. So we are saying to them, 'Come on in, come on board.'\" </p> <p>Cable companies such as Telewest, Cable and Wireless, NTL and Kingston have invested billions in localised infrastructure, yet their brand visibility to consumers compared to their satellite and terrestrial rivals is low. Telewest, which went live in March, claims to reach 1.6m, yet only has around 140,000 subscribers; Cable and Wireless's service, still on trial in Manchester, is live in 100,000 homes; NTL still hasn't launched. </p> <p>Potentially, the cable companies could provide the best packages by a long way, linking telecoms, TV and always-on, high speed internet: fully-integrated interactivity which DST and DTT cannot match. Having little experience of content provision, however, is a disadvantage and so cable companies are currently forging partnerships like mad. Telewest already has 150 content partners, whereas NTL can boast beeb.com and a couple of high street brands; it is currently bidding for football rights. </p> <p>\"If the goal is a full broadband experience, there are numerous technical reasons why cable is the best and second best is ADSL,\" says Evan Rudowski, of Excite Europe. Excite@Home - the world's largest broadband service provider, which aims to dominate home shopping across the globe and recently signed iTV deals with Microsoft, At&amp;T, and Cox - chose cable and ADSL. \"Anyone who doesn't believe cable is best is wrong.\" Until greater bandwidth is available through the phoneline, however, he believes the PC will remain the main platform for surfing and shopping. </p> <p>The fourth and unknown platform is ADSL, already a threat to big players. With the roll-out of the new technology, the telecom companies are able to make alliances with platform and service providers such as Sky, YesTV and the ADSL video-on-demand service Diva. They can then take advantage of opportunities created by the unbundling of local networks in 2001 and compete against the broadcasting giants; many ISPs are already buying up ADSL technology. </p> <p>Thomas Kressner, the CEO of Yes TV, which has been providing video-on-demand through BT, talks of \"total TV\" - integrated services including net access, email, and broadcast TV over ADSL. Yes TV has content deals with BBC, C4, Transworld and u&gt;direct amongst others. </p> <p>\"We are no longer just a video-on-demand service,\" says a Yes spokesperson. \"We are a digital service provider and intend to be a significant player in pay TV.\" In other words, it is pitting itself against the likes of ONdigital and Open. \"People thought we were going to be a small supplier. Now we have rattled a few very big cages and they are trying to give us a good kicking while they can.\" </p> <p>Of all the players in iTV, the BBC probably has most at stake. A year ago, BBC Online's commitment was to broadcasting on the net - video streamed news bulletins. But last month the department received an enormous cash influx and was renamed the BBC New Media department with an equal commitment to interactive TV and online services \"as an illustration of the impending convergence\". </p> <p>The BBC's vision for \"future TV\" is uncompromising, and can be summed up as how to get EastEnders to the widest possible audience, across a platform that will let audiences join a chat group to discuss how cute young Matthew Rose is and what a rat Steve Owen is. Greg Dyke's policy is, like his predecessor John Birt's, to spread the BBC's presence as widely as possible and the corporation is currently negotiating access to all possible platforms, and partnerships across the digital board. There is no room for risk in a market that is about to fragment explosively. </p> <p>BBC Online development executive editor, Jonathan Kingsbury confesses there is, \"too much at stake\" to sustain old rivalries with the likes of ITV (ONdigital's owners), and part-mergers and carriage deals can be expected. Beneath the bristling front-line bravado, off the record, this is what Open, ONdigital and the cable companies are also considering. It may just be as some analysts are predicting that no single platform will emerge triumphant.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's a scenario most temps are all too familiar with. You accept a booking with an exhaustive list of skills and requirements - 60wpm typing, advanced Microsoft Office, one blue eye, one brown, fluency in Swahili - only to spend the next two weeks in the job filing your nails. </p> <p>Either that or you find yourself lumbered with the chores no one can be bothered to do, from filing to fielding calls, while the rest of the team go off for a three-hour lunch. All this for a measly \u00a37 an hour. </p> <p>\"There is nothing worse than trying to look busy when you have nothing to do, or arriving at a job only to discover no one has a clue what you are supposed to be doing,\" says Karen Lake, 37, a professional temp for seven years. This is not necessarily because there is nothing to do, she says, but because temps are not briefed properly as to what needs to be done and how to do it. As summer approaches and holidaying administrators are replaced by temps, companies should consider how best to use them, to ensure it is not a waste of their own or their temps' time. </p> <p>Every office operates differently and even the most professional and hard-working of temps can't be expected to be a mind-reader. \"A PA position is very much a one-to-one role, especially in blue-chip companies where senior managers work long hours,\" says Lake. \"In that type of situation you need to know your boss's exact requirements, down to the fact that he likes coffee every half hour.\" The temp, it goes without saying, needs to be told what those requirements are. </p> <p>Permanent staff must be forward thinking in how they manage their holiday cover. First, they should decide whether they actually need a temp. Sometimes a slight redistribution of the workload among the rest of the support staff is all that is required. If you do need a temp, a prioritised list of daily duties, as well as tasks that have to be completed during the booking, is crucial to ensuring the temp has a stockpile of work to get through. </p> <p>Clear and concise handover notes and helpful colleagues make a temp's life significantly easier and more productive, as Lake discovered in one of her assignments. \"It started off as a short-term booking working for London Underground but ended up lasting nine months. There was terrific support, everyone knew what they were meant to be doing, and there was always someone to go to for help. It worked perfectly.\" </p> <p>Christine Brown, 24, who has been temping for more than a year, says many companies fail to use the skills of their temps, many of whom are over-qualified for the jobs they are covering. She blames lack of communication. \"One of the worst jobs I've had was a booking which I was told would require a good all-rounder to do typing and filing, answer phones, and provide general admin support. But all I did was file documents for eight hours a day. They could have got a junior filing clerk for \u00a36 an hour rather than paying me \u00a39 an hour.\" </p> <p>Helen Miller, director of the temporary division at Roc Recruitment, concedes that a lot of time and money can be saved by ensuring temps are properly matched to jobs. Her advice to office support staff or human resources managers is to remember that the temps are coming into a new environment. Introduce them around the office, make them feel welcome and comfortable - and set aside plenty of things for them to do. </p> <p><strong> 'Does anyone know the password?'</strong><br> * Ensure the agency knows what skills the temp will need - there is no point insisting on 60wpm when you hardly do any typing, but routinely have to download information from the internet. </p> <p>* Leave a prioritised list of tasks that have to be completed in your absence so the temp knows exactly what is expected. </p> <p>* Keep an up-to-date job description handy to give an overview of your role. </p> <p>* Leave a list of your computer passwords and frequently used internal/external phone numbers. </p> <p>* Ask a colleague to supervise and help the temp - that way there is someone to fill in anything you have overlooked. </p> <p>* Leave copies of the company's fax and letter templates so that the temp can work within house style. </p> <p>* Leave clear instructions about where everything is kept, from the petty cash box to your boss's favourite mug. </p> <p>* Always agree working hours and lunch/break times so the temp is prepared if there is any overtime to be done.</p>",

All this for a measly \u00a37 an hour. \"There is nothing worse than trying to look busy when you have nothing to do, or arriving at a job only to discover no one has a clue what you are supposed to be doing,\" says Karen Lake, 37, a professional temp for seven years. This is not necessarily because there is nothing to do, she says, but because temps are not briefed properly as to what needs to be done and how to do it. As summer approaches and holidaying administrators are replaced by temps, companies should consider how best to use them, to ensure it is not a waste of their own or their temps' time. Every office operates differently and even the most professional and hard-working of temps can't be expected to be a mind-reader. \"A PA position is very much a one-to-one role, especially in blue-chip companies where senior managers work long hours,\" says Lake. \"In that type of situation you need to know your boss's exact requirements, down to the fact that he likes coffee every half hour.\" The temp, it goes without saying, needs to be told what those requirements are. Permanent staff must be forward thinking in how they manage their holiday cover. First, they should decide whether they actually need a temp. Sometimes a slight redistribution of the workload among the rest of the support staff is all that is required. If you do need a temp, a prioritised list of daily duties, as well as tasks that have to be completed during the booking, is crucial to ensuring the temp has a stockpile of work to get through. Clear and concise handover notes and helpful colleagues make a temp's life significantly easier and more productive, as Lake discovered in one of her assignments. \"It started off as a short-term booking working for London Underground but ended up lasting nine months. There was terrific support, everyone knew what they were meant to be doing, and there was always someone to go to for help. It worked perfectly.\" Christine Brown, 24, who has been temping for more than a year, says many companies fail to use the skills of their temps, many of whom are over-qualified for the jobs they are covering. She blames lack of communication. \"One of the worst jobs I've had was a booking which I was told would require a good all-rounder to do typing and filing, answer phones, and provide general admin support. But all I did was file documents for eight hours a day. They could have got a junior filing clerk for \u00a36 an hour rather than paying me \u00a39 an hour.\" Helen Miller, director of the temporary division at Roc Recruitment, concedes that a lot of time and money can be saved by ensuring temps are properly matched to jobs. Her advice to office support staff or human resources managers is to remember that the temps are coming into a new environment. Introduce them around the office, make them feel welcome and comfortable - and set aside plenty of things for them to do. 'Does anyone know the password?' * Ensure the agency knows what skills the temp will need - there is no point insisting on 60wpm when you hardly do any typing, but routinely have to download information from the internet. * Leave a prioritised list of tasks that have to be completed in your absence so the temp knows exactly what is expected. * Keep an up-to-date job description handy to give an overview of your role. * Leave a list of your computer passwords and frequently used internal/external phone numbers. * Ask a colleague to supervise and help the temp - that way there is someone to fill in anything you have overlooked. * Leave copies of the company's fax and letter templates so that the temp can work within house style. * Leave clear instructions about where everything is kept, from the petty cash box to your boss's favourite mug. * Always agree working hours and lunch/break times so the temp is prepared if there is any overtime to be done.",

      "body": "<p>'If my work is challenging, I'm happy,\" says Donna Longstaff, production co-ordinator on ITV's celebrity impersonation show Stars in their Eyes. And with the live final looming on Saturday, the forthcoming week will certainly be a challenge. \"This is a manic show at any time, but I'm already having sleepless nights.\" </p> <p>The week will centre on making sure that things run as smoothly as possible. Meticulous planning is vital - Longstaff booked the hospitality catering and the dressing rooms, and confirmed the telephone voting lines, well in advance. She has a policy of triple-checking every detail, but it always pays to expect the unexpected. The ten winning soundalikes from the series heats are due to arrive at the Manchester studios of Granada TV at 10am on Wednesday, \"and a delayed train can have a domino effect on our rehearsal schedules. I have to ensure that we're all kept informed about what's happening.\" </p> <p>Organising the seating plan for the 200-strong audience is one of the biggest headaches. In theory, Longstaff will label each seat with the name of its occupant for the camera run-through on Thursday, but in reality it is unlikely to happen that way. Confirmations often don't arrive until hours before the show starts, and she anticipates having to revamp the document four or five times. On the night itself, she'll be in charge of a team of runners behind the scenes. </p> <p>Longstaff, 27, took a private secretary's course at Rochdale college, and says that she had no designs on a career in TV. \"I just wanted to be a PA, preferably in a big firm, that was all.\" Her two-week college placement was at Granada, and after graduating in 1990 she joined the company as a PA. </p> <p>She became production co-ordinator in 1998, and is one of a handful whose entire year is spent on Stars in their Eyes. \"I have to be incredibly good at prioritising, and thinking on my feet.\" Before the series airs, she arranges the tour in which the original 50 contestants are filmed at their home or workplace. \"Setting it up is a logistical nightmare, so two crews travel the country in a sensible order, in a fortnight. It is a fine art, synchronising the places, the people, and their availability.\" </p> <p>Longstaff tries to build up a relationship with those who take part, spending the three months in the run-up to their appearance \"hand-holding in a way, by motivating, supporting and counselling them. By the time the studio segment is taped, we're usually great friends,\" she says. Which means that if they need help, the open-plan production office is the first port of call. Rather than using their real name, they'll identify themselves as the star they are going to be. \"Whoever takes the call will shout across something like, 'Robbie Williams has got lost going to the wig-maker. He wants to know what to do,' or 'Madonna says her bra won't fit.' Things can get quite bizarre at times,\" she admits. </p> <p>The rule is one version of a particular artist for each series. \"At auditions, there might be two Celine Dions, for example, though one will have the edge. Our musical director can tell by listening to the key of the voice if the second person also sounds like someone else, and will ask if they fancy having a try.\" About a tenth of those who appear on the show will not be able to play their first-choice singer. </p> <p>And should there be little possibility of their costume being used again, she will arrange for it to be sold to them. \"However much an outfit cost to make, the most we would charge is \u00a3100. More often than not, it will be less than that.\" Almost everybody leaps at the chance to take home this memento. \"The worst part is having to explain to anyone who can't buy theirs why they can't.\" </p> <p>As for those who have walked through the famous dry ice archway in the past, many have been content simply to have appeared on TV, and have turned down offers to take it further. Others play the club circuit, or perform on cruise liners. \"Last year's Chris de Burgh has just signed a deal to record five albums. He was a paint mixer in a factory, so he's done exceptionally well,\" says Longstaff. </p> <p>\"We regularly get thank you cards, telling us that coming on Stars in their Eyes was the most fantastic experience - better than their wedding day in some cases.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "'If my work is challenging, I'm happy,\" says Donna Longstaff, production co-ordinator on ITV's celebrity impersonation show Stars in their Eyes. And with the live final looming on Saturday, the forthcoming week will certainly be a challenge. \"This is a manic show at any time, but I'm already having sleepless nights.\" The week will centre on making sure that things run as smoothly as possible. Meticulous planning is vital - Longstaff booked the hospitality catering and the dressing rooms, and confirmed the telephone voting lines, well in advance. She has a policy of triple-checking every detail, but it always pays to expect the unexpected. The ten winning soundalikes from the series heats are due to arrive at the Manchester studios of Granada TV at 10am on Wednesday, \"and a delayed train can have a domino effect on our rehearsal schedules. I have to ensure that we're all kept informed about what's happening.\" Organising the seating plan for the 200-strong audience is one of the biggest headaches. In theory, Longstaff will label each seat with the name of its occupant for the camera run-through on Thursday, but in reality it is unlikely to happen that way. Confirmations often don't arrive until hours before the show starts, and she anticipates having to revamp the document four or five times. On the night itself, she'll be in charge of a team of runners behind the scenes. Longstaff, 27, took a private secretary's course at Rochdale college, and says that she had no designs on a career in TV. \"I just wanted to be a PA, preferably in a big firm, that was all.\" Her two-week college placement was at Granada, and after graduating in 1990 she joined the company as a PA. She became production co-ordinator in 1998, and is one of a handful whose entire year is spent on Stars in their Eyes. \"I have to be incredibly good at prioritising, and thinking on my feet.\" Before the series airs, she arranges the tour in which the original 50 contestants are filmed at their home or workplace. \"Setting it up is a logistical nightmare, so two crews travel the country in a sensible order, in a fortnight. It is a fine art, synchronising the places, the people, and their availability.\" Longstaff tries to build up a relationship with those who take part, spending the three months in the run-up to their appearance \"hand-holding in a way, by motivating, supporting and counselling them. By the time the studio segment is taped, we're usually great friends,\" she says. Which means that if they need help, the open-plan production office is the first port of call. Rather than using their real name, they'll identify themselves as the star they are going to be. \"Whoever takes the call will shout across something like, 'Robbie Williams has got lost going to the wig-maker. He wants to know what to do,' or 'Madonna says her bra won't fit.' Things can get quite bizarre at times,\" she admits. The rule is one version of a particular artist for each series. \"At auditions, there might be two Celine Dions, for example, though one will have the edge. Our musical director can tell by listening to the key of the voice if the second person also sounds like someone else, and will ask if they fancy having a try.\" About a tenth of those who appear on the show will not be able to play their first-choice singer. And should there be little possibility of their costume being used again, she will arrange for it to be sold to them. \"However much an outfit cost to make, the most we would charge is \u00a3100. More often than not, it will be less than that.\" Almost everybody leaps at the chance to take home this memento. \"The worst part is having to explain to anyone who can't buy theirs why they can't.\" As for those who have walked through the famous dry ice archway in the past, many have been content simply to have appeared on TV, and have turned down offers to take it further. Others play the club circuit, or perform on cruise liners. \"Last year's Chris de Burgh has just signed a deal to record five albums. He was a paint mixer in a factory, so he's done exceptionally well,\" says Longstaff. \"We regularly get thank you cards, telling us that coming on Stars in their Eyes was the most fantastic experience - better than their wedding day in some cases.\"",

He's a prototype whizzkid installing the electronic brain, much to the chagrin of Hepburn the head librarian, a woman of formidable intelligence. You don't have to be a genius to work out the denouement. </p> <p><strong> Gorky Park</strong> (Michael Apted, 1983) <br>9pm, 3am, Carlton Cinema </p> <p>A chilly thriller set in a KGB-ridden Moscow, adapted by Dennis Potter from Martin Cruz Smith's bestseller. Wry and wan William Hurt is excellent as investigator Arkady Renko, called in after the discovery of three frozen, mutilated corpses in the park. Brian Dennehy's rogue New York cop and Lee Marvin's menacing businessman are the wild cards, Joanna Pakula the haunted beauty. Strong on atmosphere, though lacking in tension. </p> <p><strong> Cube</strong> (Vincenzo Natali, 1997) <br>10pm, Sky MovieMax </p> <p>Six people wake up inside a blank-walled cube. Doors lead off into other cubes where, they soon learn, perils lie. This small-scale Canadian production, performed by a cast of unknowns, builds a captivating tension, not through action but through the interplay of its mystified and panicky characters. Enigmatic and unsettling, it's sci-fi in the Tarkovsky model, and far more successful at it than, say, the big-bucks US movie, Sphere. </p> <p><strong> Chungking Express</strong> (Wong Kar-Wei, 1994) <br>10pm, FilmFour </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wei has already been compared to the young Jean-Luc Godard, and this shows just why - a frenetic, funny romantic comedy interweaving the adventures of two lovelorn Hong Kong cops. It's effectively a modern fairy tale, complete with touching love stories - particularly between policeman Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and wacky Faye Wang down at the local takeaway emporium - and an utterly dazzling portrait of the brash, tough city. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Desk Set (Walter Lang, 1957) 7pm, Carlton Cinema A Hepburn-Tracy double-act enlivens this workaday comedy about a computer threatening jobs at a library. He's a prototype whizzkid installing the electronic brain, much to the chagrin of Hepburn the head librarian, a woman of formidable intelligence. You don't have to be a genius to work out the denouement. Gorky Park (Michael Apted, 1983) 9pm, 3am, Carlton Cinema A chilly thriller set in a KGB-ridden Moscow, adapted by Dennis Potter from Martin Cruz Smith's bestseller. Wry and wan William Hurt is excellent as investigator Arkady Renko, called in after the discovery of three frozen, mutilated corpses in the park. Brian Dennehy's rogue New York cop and Lee Marvin's menacing businessman are the wild cards, Joanna Pakula the haunted beauty. Strong on atmosphere, though lacking in tension. Cube (Vincenzo Natali, 1997) 10pm, Sky MovieMax Six people wake up inside a blank-walled cube. Doors lead off into other cubes where, they soon learn, perils lie. This small-scale Canadian production, performed by a cast of unknowns, builds a captivating tension, not through action but through the interplay of its mystified and panicky characters. Enigmatic and unsettling, it's sci-fi in the Tarkovsky model, and far more successful at it than, say, the big-bucks US movie, Sphere. Chungking Express (Wong Kar-Wei, 1994) 10pm, FilmFour Wong Kar-Wei has already been compared to the young Jean-Luc Godard, and this shows just why - a frenetic, funny romantic comedy interweaving the adventures of two lovelorn Hong Kong cops. It's effectively a modern fairy tale, complete with touching love stories - particularly between policeman Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and wacky Faye Wang down at the local takeaway emporium - and an utterly dazzling portrait of the brash, tough city.",

      "body": "<p>Is he the godfather of the Kremlin? asks the headline. The original article, published in Forbes magazine in December 1996, might be hard to get your hands on. Only 1,915 copies were distributed in England, compared with 785,000 in America. But anyone who wants to see what it said about Boris Berezovsky, the richest man in Russia, can find out in a few clicks of a computer mouse. Just call up Forbes's website, search on Berezovsky, and it's on your screen.</p> <p>Or at least it was last Friday, the day after the law lords gave the Russian tycoon and member of the Duma the go-ahead to sue for libel in the English courts. The ruling should send shock waves through the publishing industry worldwide. For it opens up for magazine and newspaper publishers around the world the risk of entanglement in expensive libel battles in England, not just over copies picked up on English newsstands, but over articles downloaded from websites in New York or Washington by computer users in England.</p> <p>By a three to two majority, our highest court ruled that Berezovsky and an associate, who both live and work in Russia, can sue a US magazine in our courts over an article entirely concerned with their rise to power and business methods in Russia. As Lord Hoffmann, one of the two dissenters, put it, Berezovsky and his associate Nikolai Glouchkov, managing director of the Russian airline Aeroflot, \"want English law, English judicial integrity and the international publicity which would attend success in an English libel action\".</p> <p>No doubt they do, but why should we hand it to them? As Mr Justice Popplewell explained in the High Court in October 1997, when he barred them from suing in England: \"There is no English connection in the article. It is in an American magazine written in American style and is wholly connected with matters in Russia.\"</p> <p>Forbes's editor and publisher could never have imagined when they ran the article that they could end up being sued for libel in the courts of a country wholly unconnected with the magazine, the subjects of the article, or the activities it describes. The magazine now has a global edition, but in 1996 the US edition was sold abroad in small numbers, mainly to expatriate American businessmen.</p> <p>Forbes is produced in New York in a climate British journalists - operating under one of the world's most oppressive libel regimes - can hardly imagine. US journalists are protected by laws which enshrine free speech as a fundamental cornerstone of the constitution. Public figures can sue successfully only if they can prove the journalist either knew the story was false or wrote with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity - a hurdle which makes it virtually impossible for well-known plaintiffs to win.</p> <p>So the magazine had little to fear when it quoted an American businessman: \"These guys are criminals on an outrageous scale. It's as if Lucky Luciano were chairman of the board of Chrysler.\" Or when it wrote: \"Behind them lies a trail of corpses, uncollectable debts and competitors terrified for their lives\" - the allegations, among others, over which the Russians are suing.</p> <p>English law gives a right to sue for libel even if only a handful of copies are circulated in England. That rule, and libel laws which put the onus on the publisher of the story to prove it true, have made London a mecca for \"forum-shoppers\" - would-be litigants pondering which country's courts would give them the best outcome. Usually, there is simply no contest: London wins by a mile.</p> <p>\"London has become known as a town named Sue - a place where you can launder your reputation on the basis of a few sales in the UK of some overseas publication,\" writes London libel solicitor David Hooper (who happens to be Forbes's lawyer) in his new book Reputations Under Fire.</p> <p>So Robert Maxwell used the English courts to sue the New Republic (135 subscribers in the UK, compared with 98,000 circulation in the US). Commander Martin Packard won \u00a3450,000 damages in 1987 against the Greek newspaper Eleftherotypia, of which only 40 copies were sold in England. And in 1997 a UK and Israeli citizen who had lived in London since 1985 was allowed to proceed with a libel action over two articles in an Israeli newspaper written in Hebrew in issues with circulations of 141 and 19 in England.</p> <p>The Los Angeles-based tycoon, Armand Hammer, head of Occidental Petroleum, sued the UK publisher of a critical, US-written biography, which published only 3,000 copies, but not the American publishers, who produced a much bigger print run. Costs were said to exceed \u00a31.5m before Hammer's death in 1990 aged 92 brought the action to an end.</p> <p>Mr Justice Popplewell's ruling against Berezovsky and Glouchkov - along with two other recent decisions halting actions by US-based businessmen against Forbes and Dow Jones - was reckoned to mark a turning point. (One of the plaintiffs was Oscar Wyatt, whose stepson Steve's friendship with the Duchess of York boosted his claim to close business, family and social links with England.) But the Court of Appeal unanimously overturned Popplewell's decision.</p> <p>The two Russians put in further evidence via claims by accountants and financiers in England that the article had raised doubts about the wisdom of getting involved with companies known to have links with Berezovsky or Glouchkov. The Appeal Court judges were persuaded that their connections with England were significant. Berezovsky's estranged wife and two children lived in London; his two daughters from a previous marriage had graduated from Cambridge University; he visited frequently on business. He had even known Prince Michael of Kent for four years and had visited him frequently in his home at Kensington Palace.</p> <p>Forbes appealed and lost narrowly last Thursday when three law lords - Steyn, Nolan and Hobhouse - held that the Russians were entitled to use our courts to protect their reputations among business contacts in England. Lords Hoffmann and Hope came down strongly on the other side, but they were outnumbered.</p> <p>Hoffmann pointed out that Berezovsky did not want to sue in either of the two more obvious places - Russia, where his activities took place, or the US, where the article was published - because he knew he would probably lose in the US, and he claimed success in the Russian courts might be put down to his \"corrupt influence over the Russian judiciary\".</p> <p>In some respects, the English courts would be \"admirably suitable\" for the pair to vindicate their international reputations, said Hoffmann. \"But that does not mean we should always put ourselves forward as the most appropriate forum in which any foreign publisher who has distributed copies in this country, or whose publications have been downloaded here from the internet, can be required to answer the complaint of any public figure with an international reputation, however little the dispute has to do with England.\"</p> <p>Hope, also dissenting, pointed out that for all the Russians' assertions of their strong links with England, \"it could be said that their position was really no different from that of the many thousands of businessmen and women from all over Europe and North America who are to be found in the executive lounges in our airports every week of the year as they travel to or from London\".</p> <p>Among the several ironies of the case is the fact that US courts regard our libel laws as so repugnant to their notions of free speech that they refuse to enforce our libel damages awards. So Berezovsky and Glouchkov can only hope to collect damages to the extent that Forbes has assets in the UK. Forbes has an office in London, which it might be well advised to close down pronto.</p> <p>It seems there would be nothing then to stop the magazine ignoring the libel writ and letting the pair get judgment, which they would be entitled to do automatically if no defence was filed. The alternative would be weeks in the High Court trying to prove the truth of allegations for which any evidence would be in Russia.</p> <p>The high hurdle defendants already face in proving what they said was true is much higher when witnesses and documents are abroad, making it hard to subpoena them. In this sort of case, the more truth there is in the allegations, the less likely it is that witnesses will want to testify.</p> <p>Berezovsky said after the judgment: \"I brought action in England in order to clear my name before a court where the truth or falsity of the allegations will be determined.\" But no one who knows the game believes that a libel court always determines the truth. A libel win could mean that the allegations were false; equally, it could mean that witnesses lied or that the defendants were not able to produce enough relevant evidence to prove the accusations. As the Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aitken cases showed, key witnesses may lie and their lies may be more convincing than the truth.</p> <p>Of course Berezovsky and Glouchkov want \"English law, English judicial integrity and the international publicity which would attend success in an English libel action\". Russian newspapers have published scurrilous stories about them, but they have chosen not to sue there. Why should we let our courts and judges, paid for from our taxes, be used as a public relations vehicle to bolster the battered images of foreign businessmen?</p>",

The judge let her go home. But what should a judge do if he receives a note from one juror saying that some fellow jurors had made racist jokes and remarks?</p> <p>What he in fact did was to request (and receive) assurances from the jurors that they weren't racist and would reach an unbiased verdict. Not enough, said the European Court of Human Rights, ruling that an Asian defendant hadn't received an impartial trial; the judge should have discharged the jury and stopped the trial.</p> <p>I'm a little apprehensive at this decision. I fear a flurry of informants squealing to judges that fellow jurors are racist, sexist, asleep, too stupid to understand the evidence, or otherwise objectionable or biased.</p> <p>What's a judge to do? Investigate each allegation, thus breaching the secrecy of the jury room? Not allowed, and anyway impractical. Stop the trial and discharge the jury every time a complaint is made? Do nothing and wait for the defendant's inevitable, probably successful, application under human rights law that he didn't get a fair trial?</p> <p><b>First A Civil Action, then The Insider,</b> now Erin Brockovich; all of them films, based on real events, in which David, the ordinary man, woman or lawyer, confronts Goliath, the huge corporation. Two of the films involved the chemical poisoning of communities whose members - but for the Davids (lawyer John Travolta and paralegal Julia Roberts respectively) - would not have brought lawsuits and would have remained uncompensated for their suffering and deaths.</p> <p>The Insider is different in that the David - the whistleblower revealing the secrets of the tobacco company he worked for - faced the opposition of two corporations: his old employers and, ultimately, the television network which let him down. What the films have in common is an unashamed anti-corporation stance. Big business is automatically unprincipled, untruthful and contrary to the well-being of ordinary people.</p> <p>Yet what I missed was a sense of corporate ruthlessness and wickedness. The companies folded too easily; they were not villainous enough. Indeed, in Erin Brockovich, they're almost invisible, their nastiness limited to glowering looks in the courtroom and a mildly threatening phone call. Corporate evil in The Insider was portrayed by the tobacco boss, played by Michael Gambon stroking a cat, like Charles Gray in the Bond films.</p> <p>The result, for me, was disappointment that the Davids - especially Brockovich - had it so easy. Lack of tension was caused not by the fact that we all knew who was going to win anyway, but that the struggle seemed so lacklustre. Bring back villainous corporations who will stop at nothing.</p> <p><b> The recent popular Bring Your Daughter to Work</b> day, a bonding occasion when mothers (and fathers) can impress (or embarrass) their offspring by showing them how they earn their living, wasn't of much help to one professional category - trial lawyers. Children under 14 aren't allowed into court; so those whose parents are advocates (or judges) weren't able to see them in brilliant action. I can understand why under-14s shouldn't be allowed to watch rape, murder or other sex 'n' gore trials; but why a blanket ban?</p> <p>Why shouldn't a 13- or even 12 year-old sit in on the many non-sensitive cases, learning how our legal system works? It can always be left to the judge to exclude a child in a particular case, but the rule should be to allow them in, not keep them out.</p> <p><b> I used to chortle,</b> in a what-will-American-lawyers-think-of next sort of way;but I've just read a book which has made me laugh a little less patronisingly. Rattling the Cage, by Steven Wise (Profile Books), is a plea for some animals to be given legal rights, not just in the sense of being protected from man's cruelty, but active, positive rights, similar to those accorded to human beings.</p> <p>The book is worth reading for its splendid historical outline of past relationships between animals and the law, not the least fascinating examples, in many societies, of animals prosecuted in the criminal courts. In mediaeval France, for instance, it was not uncommon for pigs to be convicted of murder; the sentence of death often accompanied by the judge's order that the pig's body should be left to hang in a public place, as a deterrent to other pigs.</p> <p>Wise's book is sub-titled Towards Legal Rights For Animals, and he picks out chimpanzees and bonobo apes as being particularly worthy of being granted such rights. I am troubled by his reasoning. These animals, he argues, have as much intelligence, cognitive skills and autonomy as babies, small children or severely mentally handicapped adults. Those humans have rights; why not the cleverer \"non-human animals\"?</p> <p>I'm tempted to give the informed, intellectual reply: \"Because, that's why\". The fact is, animals ain't people. But Wise has made me think. A little.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A few years ago a woman juror at Croydon Crown Court told the judge that her intense racial prejudice prevented her from reaching an unbiased verdict in the trial of a black defendant. The judge let her go home. But what should a judge do if he receives a note from one juror saying that some fellow jurors had made racist jokes and remarks? What he in fact did was to request (and receive) assurances from the jurors that they weren't racist and would reach an unbiased verdict. Not enough, said the European Court of Human Rights, ruling that an Asian defendant hadn't received an impartial trial; the judge should have discharged the jury and stopped the trial. I'm a little apprehensive at this decision. I fear a flurry of informants squealing to judges that fellow jurors are racist, sexist, asleep, too stupid to understand the evidence, or otherwise objectionable or biased. What's a judge to do? Investigate each allegation, thus breaching the secrecy of the jury room? Not allowed, and anyway impractical. Stop the trial and discharge the jury every time a complaint is made? Do nothing and wait for the defendant's inevitable, probably successful, application under human rights law that he didn't get a fair trial? First A Civil Action, then The Insider, now Erin Brockovich; all of them films, based on real events, in which David, the ordinary man, woman or lawyer, confronts Goliath, the huge corporation. Two of the films involved the chemical poisoning of communities whose members - but for the Davids (lawyer John Travolta and paralegal Julia Roberts respectively) - would not have brought lawsuits and would have remained uncompensated for their suffering and deaths. The Insider is different in that the David - the whistleblower revealing the secrets of the tobacco company he worked for - faced the opposition of two corporations: his old employers and, ultimately, the television network which let him down. What the films have in common is an unashamed anti-corporation stance. Big business is automatically unprincipled, untruthful and contrary to the well-being of ordinary people. Yet what I missed was a sense of corporate ruthlessness and wickedness. The companies folded too easily; they were not villainous enough. Indeed, in Erin Brockovich, they're almost invisible, their nastiness limited to glowering looks in the courtroom and a mildly threatening phone call. Corporate evil in The Insider was portrayed by the tobacco boss, played by Michael Gambon stroking a cat, like Charles Gray in the Bond films. The result, for me, was disappointment that the Davids - especially Brockovich - had it so easy. Lack of tension was caused not by the fact that we all knew who was going to win anyway, but that the struggle seemed so lacklustre. Bring back villainous corporations who will stop at nothing. The recent popular Bring Your Daughter to Work day, a bonding occasion when mothers (and fathers) can impress (or embarrass) their offspring by showing them how they earn their living, wasn't of much help to one professional category - trial lawyers. Children under 14 aren't allowed into court; so those whose parents are advocates (or judges) weren't able to see them in brilliant action. I can understand why under-14s shouldn't be allowed to watch rape, murder or other sex 'n' gore trials; but why a blanket ban? Why shouldn't a 13- or even 12 year-old sit in on the many non-sensitive cases, learning how our legal system works? It can always be left to the judge to exclude a child in a particular case, but the rule should be to allow them in, not keep them out. I used to chortle, in a what-will-American-lawyers-think-of next sort of way;but I've just read a book which has made me laugh a little less patronisingly. Rattling the Cage, by Steven Wise (Profile Books), is a plea for some animals to be given legal rights, not just in the sense of being protected from man's cruelty, but active, positive rights, similar to those accorded to human beings. The book is worth reading for its splendid historical outline of past relationships between animals and the law, not the least fascinating examples, in many societies, of animals prosecuted in the criminal courts. In mediaeval France, for instance, it was not uncommon for pigs to be convicted of murder; the sentence of death often accompanied by the judge's order that the pig's body should be left to hang in a public place, as a deterrent to other pigs. Wise's book is sub-titled Towards Legal Rights For Animals, and he picks out chimpanzees and bonobo apes as being particularly worthy of being granted such rights. I am troubled by his reasoning. These animals, he argues, have as much intelligence, cognitive skills and autonomy as babies, small children or severely mentally handicapped adults. Those humans have rights; why not the cleverer \"non-human animals\"? I'm tempted to give the informed, intellectual reply: \"Because, that's why\". The fact is, animals ain't people. But Wise has made me think. A little.",

      "body": "<p>It sounds like a highly spurious PhD subject, or one of those how-did-they-fund-that? research studies at a university no one's ever heard of: the relationship between restaurant tables, political change and national identity. In fact, it's Quebec's most celebrated living writer, playwright Michel Tremblay, explaining how his hometown of Montreal has changed since he began writing more than 30 years ago. </p> <p>Until the mid-70s, he says, Montreal was \"a Puritan city, where you never sat outside to eat and drink. It was unthinkable. Like the English, we did everything inside.\" All that changed when the balance of power moved from the English-speakers to the Francophone majority. \"We became a French city, even though the percentage of French speakers remained the same. We all began to sit outside, to eat and drink as others strolled by. From May to October, we now live outside.\" </p> <p>So do the 11 characters in Tremblay's play Solemn Mass for a Full Moon in Summer, which opens the Barbican's Bite:00 festival this week, following the premiere of its new translation at Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre. Set on six Montreal tenement balconies one stultifyingly hot August night, Solemn Mass is a dark and searching tale of modern love. </p> <p>While the balcony setting can be explained away by the city's love of the outdoor life, the play's structure - that of a traditional Catholic mass - has rather less prosaic roots. Tremblay knew he wanted to write a love story, with six couples each at a different stage in their relationships, but had no idea how to structure the play. Then he stumbled across a CD of a mass that Berlioz had written, hated and discarded at the beginning of his career and that had only resurfaced 170 years later. </p> <p>\"All the human emotions are there in the Catholic mass, from exhilaration to the depths of the abyss,\" he explains when we meet in Montreal. \"So I thought, why not take this as my form and write a kind of spoken cantata. I wanted to extend the lyricism in my work and write something that is almost singing.\" </p> <p>Clashing with this religious framework are the very human qualities of the lives and loves he portrays. The ambitious structure is matched by the frank, sometimes startling, admissions the couples make to each other. A young couple in the first full flush of love recite their sexual fantasies; a widow mourns her erotic loss; a gay man with Aids tells his partner he doesn't regret the encounter through which he contracted the disease. It is this storyline that marks the biggest innovation for Tremblay, who has never before touched on the disease in his plays. </p> <p>\"A man whom I lived with for 10 years had a son, and when he was 13 we had to explain that making love was dangerous, that sex was beautiful but could also be deadly. It was terrible, having to say that. </p> <p>\"But it took me 13 years to write about it. During the 80s we were so afraid. It was so important and terrifying, that had I written about it, it would have been the most important thing in the play - and a disease should never be that. Later, something changed. I had heard a lot of older men with Aids saying that they didn't regret the encounters that gave them the disease, and I wanted to have a character say that for those few minutes he felt young and beautiful, so he would never regret it.\" </p> <p>Tremblay maintains, however, that the disease is not the most important thing in the scenes between the two men, that the point they have reached together is what interests him dramatically. \"When you're falling out of love, there is always one conversation in which you tell something to your partner, ask them if they understand, and they say no. That's what happens here and it's that, not Aids itself, that I'm interested in.\" </p> <p>As a play about love, Solemn Mass has far more emphasis on falling out than on falling in (\"Well, I'm 57,\" Tremblay says with a laugh) and there are some terrifically bleak, honest moments about the cruelty, boredom and violence that can set in when love leaves. Yet somehow it feels redemptive at the end, when the cast have finished their 10-minute monologues and joined together as a chorus once more to sing, \"Amen.\" Tremblay's explanation for this is once again rooted in Quebec's recent history. </p> <p>\"My generation of Quebecois were all raised in small houses with small rooms and windows. In the 60s, when we decided we wanted to be somebody, we tore down the walls, put in big windows and discovered the joy of space and light. I'm not sure, though, that we did that as individuals. We renovated our houses but not our souls, and that's what the characters are doing. It's not, I hope, too late for us to do that.\" </p> <p>A deeply personal play, Solemn Mass is in its own way as radical as the works Tremblay is best known for, the plays in which he put Montreal working-class speech - joual - onto the world stage. This elevation of the vernacular in plays such as Les Belles Soeurs brought a stigmatised language into the cultural mainstream. Though not as politically loaded, the new play brings into view all the details of love - the murky, dirty, despicable aspects of love - that are routinely left out of conversation, theatrical productions and certainly Catholic doctrine. Like all of Tremblay's best work, it is geographically and historically rooted, but also impressively universal. </p> <p>What you may not recognise, if you're not familiar with Montreal and in particular Plateau Mont-Royal, the district where Tremblay sets his plays, are the balconies. Far more than a dramatic device to have all the characters in their own space but on stage at the same time, they are essential to the special quality of this drama. \"You must go see,\" Tremblay urges, grabbing my map of the city. \"They call this area Tremblayland!\" Recently, he says, someone bought the house where he grew up. When word got round that the new owner planned to remove the front door, fans offered to buy it. That's how big Tremblay is round here. </p> <p>I take a tour on foot through the landscape of Tremblay's youth - an overcrowded and brutal place by all accounts, though it has since been prettified - and see how every house has its balconies and wrought iron staircases. Garden furniture is in place, as are pot plants and homely touches like carpet on the stairs and fake grass on the floor. These extra rooms are both private and public, with sound and fury bound to carry from one to another. Suddenly, the balconies in the play make sense. As I turn into Rue Fabre, at the very heart of Tremblayland, church bells begin to ring out, deafeningly loudly. The idea of the mass being a structure through which the rest of your life might be held up, examined and measured makes sense too. I almost say a little prayer at this revelation but opt instead for a quick, quiet, \"Amen.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Solemn Mass for a Full Moon in Summer opens the Bite:00 festival at the Barbican , London EC1 (020-7638 8891), on Wednesday and runs till June 3.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was the story of the cats and the lavatory that amused me and gave me the clearest idea yet of what living in an apartment in a real skyscraper must be like. Lynn Osmond, president of the Chicago Architecture Foundation, lives on the 45th floor of a downtown tower overlooking Lake Michigan on one side and Big John, the 100-floor John Hancock Centre and one of the tallest buildings in the world, on the other. Such is the swaying of her building during storms, she told me, that the water in the lavatory basin shifts from side to side. The cats sit fascinated on the porcelain rim, pawing the water as it sloshes about, and play there until the storm abates. </p> <p>Osmond is never less than awed during electric storms as jagged forks of lightning stab into the twin red-and-white communications antennae that rise 350ft above the roof of this gloriously brutal 1,127ft skyscraper. And then there are the days when there is nothing to see outside because the 45th floor is in cloud. But what about those mornings when you look out of your bedroom window and find the clouds beneath you? </p> <p>Still, this is chicken feed in the wonderful world of skyscraper living. If you can afford it, there are 90th floor apartments in Big John, offering views across Lake Michigan and the great wheat plains of Illinois as far as the eye can possibly see. In the Signature Room cocktail bar even higher up, dry martinis are shaken not stirred by the sheer force of the wind acting on the 46,000-ton steel structure of this architectural behemoth. But you ain't seen nothing yet. In the very heart of Chicago, work is about to begin on the tallest building in the world. Including its twin 450ft lightning-conducting digital communications antennae, 7 South Dearborn will be 2,000ft tall, with 108 floors. </p> <p>Until it is completed in three or four years' time, the world's tallest building title will belong to the super-kitsch twin Petronas Towers (1,483ft) in Kuala Lumpur. They were designed by the New York architect Cesar Pelli, although William F Baker, structural engineering partner of Skidmore Owings and Merrill (SOM) had a hand in the development of this 88-storey condiment set. Baker is also the structural engineer of 7 South Dearborn, and SOM the designer of Big John and the Sears Tower in Chicago, which at 1,450ft held the tallest building title from 1974 until the Petronas Towers pipped it by 33ft in 1996. </p> <p>Seven South Dearborn will be a genuinely mixed-use building, with shops and restaurants at street level, 11 floors of parking for 800 cars, 32 floors of offices, 40 floors of (cat-friendly) apartments and 13 floors of hi-tech communications gear. More than this, it promises to be as slender and appealing as the previous monsters - the World Trade Centre in New York, the Sears Tower and their kid brother, the Cesar Pelli-designed Canary Wharf tower in London - are bulky and dull. </p> <p>This is because 7 South Dearborn is being designed to attract a new wave of hi-tech dot.com enterprises with highly paid staff who want a view over Lake Michigan in one direction and the infinitely receding wheat plain in the other: no one wants to moulder under fluorescent lighting beside the liftshaft, and the same applies to those renting the apartments, 80 or 90 storeys up. Furthermore, Baker's design is highly innovative: each floor will be cantilevered from a central concrete core, up which elevators and essential services will run. The structure is thus very light for a skyscraper, eschewing all those tens of thousands of tons of steel girders that have been the bones of high-rise buildings since they were born in Chicago some 110 years ago. </p> <p>In effect, 7 South Dearborn is an exceptionally tall yacht's mast of a building, with floors strung out from it like sails. What could be more fitting for a skyscraper? The word was adopted from the terminology of sailing ships: the skyscraper was a ship's topmost sail. </p> <p>Banks of floors will be divided by notched setbacks that will break up what would otherwise be the sheer, monumental nature of the stainless steel and aluminium tower and ensure that it looks as much like a communications mast as it does an office tower, shopping centre, place to eat and apartment block. And if anyone thinks a communications mast sounds a bit ugly, they have yet to see Norman Foster's superb, skyscraping communications tower in Barcelona. </p> <p>After decades of bland skyscraper design worldwide, the beauty of 7 South Dearborn comes as both a surprise and a relief. For too long developers and their architects have viewed skyscrapers as highly ambitious rent-slabs, filing cabinets stacked as high into the sky as economics, egos and local planning laws have allowed. The last truly elegant skyscrapers were the Empire State Building of 1931 and the Chrysler Building of the year before. There have been some fascinating structural leviathans since - SOM's John Hancock Centre of 1969 and I M Pei's Bank of China, Hong Kong (1989) among them, but most have been banal and bullying. </p> <p>If the building lacks anything, it is an innovation such as the sky gardens that Foster and Partners has created in the shaft of Commerzbank in Frankfurt, the tallest building in Europe. These occur at regular intervals, allowing sunlight and greenery into the tower. Commerzbank, however, is a corporate venture that was willing to sacrifice chunks of office space and invest heavily in financially unprofitable gardens; 7 South Dearborn, by contrast, has been built like most US skyscrapers by developers - in this case, European American Realty Ltd - in pursuit of a maximum return on capital invested. </p> <p>There's one other thing missing from 7 South Dearborn: the wind-sway that keeps the cats so happy in Lynn Osmond's 45th-floor Chicago apartment. According to Baker, the concrete shaft should be far more stable than its skeletal steel predecessors. Miaow.</p>",

This is because 7 South Dearborn is being designed to attract a new wave of hi-tech dot.com enterprises with highly paid staff who want a view over Lake Michigan in one direction and the infinitely receding wheat plain in the other: no one wants to moulder under fluorescent lighting beside the liftshaft, and the same applies to those renting the apartments, 80 or 90 storeys up. Furthermore, Baker's design is highly innovative: each floor will be cantilevered from a central concrete core, up which elevators and essential services will run. The structure is thus very light for a skyscraper, eschewing all those tens of thousands of tons of steel girders that have been the bones of high-rise buildings since they were born in Chicago some 110 years ago. In effect, 7 South Dearborn is an exceptionally tall yacht's mast of a building, with floors strung out from it like sails. What could be more fitting for a skyscraper? The word was adopted from the terminology of sailing ships: the skyscraper was a ship's topmost sail. Banks of floors will be divided by notched setbacks that will break up what would otherwise be the sheer, monumental nature of the stainless steel and aluminium tower and ensure that it looks as much like a communications mast as it does an office tower, shopping centre, place to eat and apartment block. And if anyone thinks a communications mast sounds a bit ugly, they have yet to see Norman Foster's superb, skyscraping communications tower in Barcelona. After decades of bland skyscraper design worldwide, the beauty of 7 South Dearborn comes as both a surprise and a relief. For too long developers and their architects have viewed skyscrapers as highly ambitious rent-slabs, filing cabinets stacked as high into the sky as economics, egos and local planning laws have allowed. The last truly elegant skyscrapers were the Empire State Building of 1931 and the Chrysler Building of the year before. There have been some fascinating structural leviathans since - SOM's John Hancock Centre of 1969 and I M Pei's Bank of China, Hong Kong (1989) among them, but most have been banal and bullying. If the building lacks anything, it is an innovation such as the sky gardens that Foster and Partners has created in the shaft of Commerzbank in Frankfurt, the tallest building in Europe. These occur at regular intervals, allowing sunlight and greenery into the tower. Commerzbank, however, is a corporate venture that was willing to sacrifice chunks of office space and invest heavily in financially unprofitable gardens; 7 South Dearborn, by contrast, has been built like most US skyscrapers by developers - in this case, European American Realty Ltd - in pursuit of a maximum return on capital invested. There's one other thing missing from 7 South Dearborn: the wind-sway that keeps the cats so happy in Lynn Osmond's 45th-floor Chicago apartment. According to Baker, the concrete shaft should be far more stable than its skeletal steel predecessors. Miaow.",

At 27, she is spearheading a small theatrical revolution among Palestinians in the West Bank. Stephen Daldry, associate director of London's Royal Court, describes her as \"a potent force for developing Palestinian playwrights, exceptional as a woman in her cultural context\". Elyse Dodgson, head of the theatre's international department, says she has \"conviction, determination, vision, respect\". And the theatre she founded near Bethlehem is called \"Inad\", which means \"stubborn\". </p> <p>It takes a lot to intimidate Raeda Ghazaleh. She was the first Palestinian to complete a degree at Israel's School of Visual Theatre. Did she find it difficult? \"It wasn't easy for them to accept me,\" she says. \"I was young, I was Palestinian, I didn't speak Hebrew. So I learned Hebrew.\" </p> <p>She went to the college at the height of the intifada, when young Palestinians erupted in a sustained stone-throwing uprising against the Israeli occupation. Many were killed. Did she feel safe? \"Nothing is safe and dying is easy in Palestine,\" she says. \"But you get used to it.\" </p> <p>She was chosen out of nowhere by the highflying Stephen Daldry to assist on his production of Rat in the Skull, a play about Ireland. Was she overawed? Well, on the Monday before the opening night, she told him she thought his ending was wrong. And he changed it. </p> <p>She hasn't even been intimidated by the virtual absence of a theatrical tradition among Palestinian writers. \"The war in Palestine took so much energy that it only left room for solitary writing, novels and poems,\" Ghazaleh says, \"not for the group-work of theatre.\" So she made a wish-list of her favourite novelists or poets and went to see them all. \"Imagine some guy writing alone in Hebron; he doesn't expect a young girl to come and persuade him to write for the stage. It's a shock for him,\" she laughs. Eventually she got together a group of eight writers, culminating in a week of readings at east Jerusalem's legendary Al-Kasaba theatre and, this week, two readings at the Royal Court. </p> <p>Ghazaleh came to the attention of the Royal Court as part of its vibrant international programme - the very programme that produced David Hare's Via Dolorosa - when Daldry and Dodgson founded a Palestinian playwriting project. \"We felt that, led by Raeda, this would be something new and different,\" Dodgson says. </p> <p>And indeed it has been. For a start, neither of the plays being read this week is about politics. \"People think Palestinians must want to write about politics all the time,\" Ghazaleh says. \"But artists can see society in different ways. Our outer life is clear: we have the enemy and we know the situation. But now in Palestine we have to look to building our inner life; how we build inside ourselves. Our political situation is a part of who we are, but it is not the whole of us.\" </p> <p>Ghazaleh grew up close to the theatre - her aunt was an actress - but her drive comes from her father. \"He had to work as head of a hotel laundry, so he could not study. He always pushed his children, boys and girls the same, to have the education he so wanted for himself.\" </p> <p>Her father also gave her the building for the Inad theatre company. How did she come up with the name? \"It was the middle of the intifada and everything was hard, and we were feeling that nothing good was going to happen again. So we said, yes, let's call it Inad, to show that we are stubborn enough to continue.\" </p> <p>She believes the intifada was a hopeful time because the Palestinians were fighting back. \"Most of the time people now are very down,\" she says. \"You don't see the hope in the eyes that you saw in the intifada. Everything since the beginning of the peace process has gone downhill. This peace process is just a joke.\" Hers is a young and widely-held belief rarely heard in the west. </p> <p>But in that gloom there is, she says, a kind of salvation, a national maturity, in developing a homegrown theatrical tradition. \"Art, but especially theatre, is a place to be free and open, to say things you can't say on the street or in the family.

Amanda, the hard-living single girl with a plenitude of super-sharp put-downs at her disposal, was swapping complaints with the worry-faced Dervla Kirwan. Boringly-married Dervla thought single girl Amanda had a full-steam-ahead life of exciting men and all-night drinking, while her own domestic life at home with her husband and child was, well, the pits.</p> <p>While the machinations of sub-standard TV dramas are best left to those Saturday nights in when you can't be bothered to find something less boring instead, it hit on a timely conundrum. It's a verifiable fact that many women are deferring the joy and pain of long-term relationships, marriage and children. The average age of first marriage and child continues to rise, to 27 and 29 respectively.

I almost felt like I was letting my friends and family down by getting married young.\" The message has been coming across loud and clear: choose life, choose a TV, but don't choose marriage or kids. \"There's a lot of pressure,\" Licence says. \"Women of our generation have got to have gone to college, had a career, been around the world, had loads of relationships and then, only then, you're allowed to have a child.\"</p> <p>I had a child when I was 25. Not old, not young. Judging by some people's reactions, you'd think I was barely out of my teens. The way men and women born in the 70s and 80s arrange our long-term living is clearly shifting and marriage is becoming one option among many. Illegitimacy is a non-issue: when was the last time you heard the word bastard used in its original context?</p> <p>But while the choices are relatively new, there is bound to be confusion. And for the moment, that means marriage and kids among (mostly middle-class) twentysomethings is becoming almost unusual. \"I think because of our parents' experience, women have thought we were going to be chained to the kitchen sink if we married,\" Baird says. \"I've just realised that you can be independent and not compromised by being married or having a child. The girl out drinking all night with her lad friends is a myth and the idea that when you get married or have kids you're never going to see daylight again is a myth, too. They're fantasies, not people's lives. It's pick and mix, and choosing marriage doesn't mean choosing one lifestyle.\"</p> <p>People choose to solve the love equation early for good reasons. It gave me structure and order - something a bit lacking before. Like Baird, who says she was \"literally terrified of settling down and compromising myself\", I felt that independence was just a physical state.</p> <p>\"I've now got a massive chunk of my life sorted,\" Licence admits, \"and I can get on with a career without worrying about it. I just didn't want to put off the inevitable. This way, I can have a child, recover, and continue my career after.\"</p> <p>She points to the recent coverage of Germaine Greer, who has expressed regrets about her childlessness. \"Even people who've had it all wish they'd done it,\" she says. Adams reiterates the pull of what Julie Burchill calls the \"Judas womb\". \"I hadn't expected to hear this, but the biological aspect is very powerful and it's particularly powerful in women of 28 or 29.\"</p> <p>Of course it's not black and white. You don't choose between perma-girl and Top Shop or settling down and Dorothy Perkins. Says Adams: \"Every woman has a part of them that's an eternal girl, with the exception of women who have had it knocked out of them by life experience. People are happy dipping in to it, but it's a choice not a character facet.\"</p> <p>So back to Hearts And Bones. What of freedom-loving single girl Amanda?

      "body": "<p>In October 1945 the Errol Flynn-starring film Objective Burma opened in London. It was of a piece with the movies that Flynn (Hollywood's most famous Robin Hood) had been making since 1939 - fantasies of daring war heroism. </p> <p>In fact Flynn, a closet fascist, had spent the war years fending off statutory rape suits (he liked \"jailbait\" - young girls) and perfecting his ground shots (he was a good tennis player). </p> <p>Objective Burma was shot in Palm Springs, where the pampered star complained bitterly that his trailer dressing room was less well air-conditioned than Bette Davis's. </p> <p>The plot of Objective Burma is simple. A small band of American paratroops is dropped behind enemy lines in the jungle. Their mission? To destroy a Japanese radar station. They must succeed or the Allied invasion of Burma will fail. </p> <p>In fact, no paratroops were ever dropped in Burma - least of all American. The campaign was won by the foot-slogging efforts of the British 14th (or \"forgotten\") Army. </p> <p>The reaction in Britain to Objective Burma was furious. Questions were asked in the House. There were demonstrations outside cinemas. The film was withdrawn after a few days. Flynn himself was subjected to violent verbal and, occasionally, physical abuse. His name was still a proverbial term of contempt (\"Errol Flynning it\") in the British Army 15 years later, when I was a national serviceman. Perhaps it still is. </p> <p>U-571 opened in US theatres on April 21 and has topped the box-office charts ever since. Its release coincided with the 25th anniversary of the fall of Saigon: an occasion for much American soul-searching and mournful militarism. </p> <p>U-571 carries the motto \"Heroes are ordinary people who do extraordinary things in extraordinary times\". The film reminds Americans that they once fought a clean war. Also, perhaps, it distracts them from the fact that the unheroic Clinton, Gore and George W Bush did extraordinary things to avoid combat in Vietnam (\"War? Ordinary people can do it for us\"). </p> <p>The plot, devised by director Jonathan Mostow, echoes Objective Burma. A small band of American submariners is sent into enemy waters to capture an Enigma encryption device (\"All this for a goddamn typewriter!\" as one character exclaims).

      "bodyText": "In October 1945 the Errol Flynn-starring film Objective Burma opened in London. It was of a piece with the movies that Flynn (Hollywood's most famous Robin Hood) had been making since 1939 - fantasies of daring war heroism. In fact Flynn, a closet fascist, had spent the war years fending off statutory rape suits (he liked \"jailbait\" - young girls) and perfecting his ground shots (he was a good tennis player). Objective Burma was shot in Palm Springs, where the pampered star complained bitterly that his trailer dressing room was less well air-conditioned than Bette Davis's. The plot of Objective Burma is simple. A small band of American paratroops is dropped behind enemy lines in the jungle. Their mission? To destroy a Japanese radar station. They must succeed or the Allied invasion of Burma will fail. In fact, no paratroops were ever dropped in Burma - least of all American. The campaign was won by the foot-slogging efforts of the British 14th (or \"forgotten\") Army. The reaction in Britain to Objective Burma was furious. Questions were asked in the House. There were demonstrations outside cinemas. The film was withdrawn after a few days. Flynn himself was subjected to violent verbal and, occasionally, physical abuse. His name was still a proverbial term of contempt (\"Errol Flynning it\") in the British Army 15 years later, when I was a national serviceman. Perhaps it still is. U-571 opened in US theatres on April 21 and has topped the box-office charts ever since. Its release coincided with the 25th anniversary of the fall of Saigon: an occasion for much American soul-searching and mournful militarism. U-571 carries the motto \"Heroes are ordinary people who do extraordinary things in extraordinary times\". The film reminds Americans that they once fought a clean war. Also, perhaps, it distracts them from the fact that the unheroic Clinton, Gore and George W Bush did extraordinary things to avoid combat in Vietnam (\"War? Ordinary people can do it for us\"). The plot, devised by director Jonathan Mostow, echoes Objective Burma. A small band of American submariners is sent into enemy waters to capture an Enigma encryption device (\"All this for a goddamn typewriter!\" as one character exclaims). If they fail, the war will be lost. The mission is achieved with much Errol Flynning - some of it preposterous, even to a landlubber's eyes. The half-dozen Americans stranded on U-571 instantly master the controls. They blow another German sub and a destroyer out of the water. Depth charge to left of them, depth charge to right of them, volley and thunder. They survive unscathed. The film has yet to hit the British screen but there have already been complaints.

      "body": "<p>Bill Wyman, former bass player with the Rolling Stones, is a man with few affectations. (Very few expressions, too, but that's another matter.) He doesn't wear jewellery or fancy suits. \"They told me to dress up for this. Well, I didn't.\" There's raggedy salt-and-pepper stubble above his upper lip.</p> <p>And there are marks on his trouser legs where they've been turned down. He's 63, but he says he doesn't care about growing old. \"It doesn't bother me, it doesn't bother me at all.\" So why does he dye his hair? \"Of course I do,\" he says abruptly. But why? \"I don't know, it just looks better.\" Wouldn't it look nicer if he left it to match his eyebrows? \"No, no,\" he says, looking quite interested, for him. \"My greyness is in patches. Mainly round the back.\" He ducks his head to demonstrate, waves his fag over the top. \"And then there are other bits that aren't and it's sort of blotchy, that's the trouble. I'd end up like a dalmatian dog.\"</p> <p>Wyman is a facts-and-figures man. Accuracy, that's what he likes. Dates. All his stuff is alphabeticised at home. And it drives him mad when people come up to him in the street and say, \"'I remember you guys. I used to come and watch you at Eel Pie Island in 1961.' I say, 'No, you didn't. We didn't play until '62.'\"</p> <p>When I tell him that in my straw poll, more people associated him with Mandy Smith, his former teenage lover, than the Stones, he says: \"That's because it happened in the 80s, it's in their minds. If you'd have asked people in 1969 they'd have said the Stones.\" But he hadn't dated a 13-year-old then. \"Short-term memory,\" he interrupts grimly. \"They do not believe you when you tell them.\"</p> <p>If Wyman is a rock'n'roll animal, he's Eeyore, head down, disgruntled, never quite mucking in with Tigger and the rest. If Jagger was all mouth, and Richards all trousers, Wyman was all nose. He's the band's archivist. He's got 30 suitcases full of material in the attics of his house in Chelsea. (\"Not suitcases. Trunks.\") He was with the band for 31 years, from his audition in '62 (after his national service) to his departure in '93, but he was always, he says, \"the odd one out\". Jagger and Richards \"didn't leave much room for anybody else to contribute. That was the frustration.\"</p> <p>Rhythm Kings, his new 12-piece jazz and blues outfit, has a lineup including Georgie Fame and Peter Frampton. Wyman, who remains polite about the other Stones, whom he still sees from time to time, says of the new band: \"There's never any arguments. No one being a prima donna or bossing it or showing off, or trying to take over.\" If he has one regret in life, it's that he didn't leave the Stones earlier. \"But I had to stay for the money.\"</p> <p>Was he an outsider because he didn't take drugs? \"No, it was that I had other interests. Music was never my be-all and end-all, as it was for, say, Keith.\" He's been smoking, but he finishes his cigarette now, stubbing it out with a double twist. \"When we were in Mexico City, for instance, and they were all hanging round the hotel, I was at the Museum of Mankind for the whole day, examining the stuff. No one else would come.\" \"I see,\" I say. But he hasn't finished. \"And when we were in New York, they had a big exhibition of old cameras from the 1800s, so I'd go there.\" Right. \"And then when we were in New Zealand I went to the hot springs and all that.\" He pauses. It looks like he might have finished converting those infamous world tours into sightseeing achievements, but no. \"And then when we were in Athens I went to all the old buildings, the old statues and temples and things. Same in Japan. And the others would be down the nightclubs.\"</p> <p>Not that he missed out on the clubs altogether. There was a two-year period in the 60s when he logged the 278 women he slept with. \"No. Well, yeah, one or two. Yeah.\" He laughs. \"Huh, huh, huh.\"</p> <p>You'd never know from talking to Wyman that he spent 31 years in the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world. Some of the time you just feel you're chatting to an old geezer on the bus. He votes Tory, will next time, too.</p> <p>\"Yeah, because I remember what Labour's all about. I remember having to leave the country in '71 because tax was at 90%. Never trust 'em. I vote Tory because that's where I come from.\" When asked what else he might have been, he says, \"You know what Einstein said? A plumber. Maybe that, or a photographer or a librarian. Yeah, I'd like to have been a librarian.\" He believes in capital punishment. His favourite meal is lamb chops and mashed potato.</p> <p>He talks a lot about money, and not having enough. \"I'm not super-comfortable,\" he says, which seems rich coming from someone who owns a house in Chelsea, a villa in France and a moated manor in Suffolk. Perhaps the moat needs a lot of upkeep? \"We've got live fish in there,\" he says proudly. \"And wildfowl, ducks, geese. Of course we do.\"</p> <p>Odd that the working-class boy from Sydenham still seems to have something to prove. Si Si, Je Suis un Rock Star, his solo single from the early 80s, he says, \"was the most successful solo by any member of the Stones\". Playing in a charity cricket match at the Oval, he was the third person ever to take a hat-trick there. He's not a grandfather yet. \"The only Stone who isn't,\" he says with a chip of something.</p> <p>But, of course (to use his favourite word: \"Is it? Course it is.\" Big grin), he's not an old geezer at all. He's the father of three girls, \"and to them I'm just Dad\". He married his third wife, Suzanne Accosta, an actress and fashion designer, in 1993: \"She gave up her career. I gave up my bad habits.\" He knows the names of the Teletubbies. He gives tips on communicating long-distance to toddlers: \"I go, 'Di di di di, da da da' and she sings it back. You should try it.\"</p> <p>You could also almost call him a new man these days, though he looks baffled when this is suggested. \"New man? You mean like the shop? Do you know their sign? If you look at it upside down it still says New Man. It does. You should look.\"</p> <p>His eldest daughter, Katie, is five. Mandy Smith was 13 when he met her. They dated for two years before the press got hold of it, split up, and married, briefly, when she was 18. I wondered what Wyman would think if Katie was to date a 57-year-old in eight years' time? \"Won't happen,\" he says, \"because my Katie won't start going to pubs and clubs and night habitats when she's 10 so when she's 14 she won't look like a 20-year-old. That's the difference.\"</p> <p>Wyman is adept at moving swiftly on. \"I want them to be as normal as possible. I never encouraged my son to be a drummer or guitarist. I let him do what he wanted. And he did really well. He got 10 O levels, two A levels, maths and chemistry. And a degree, with honours, in business studies. So he turned out his own person.\" Maths? I say, impressed. \"Yeah, well, I'm good at maths, too,\" he says quickly.</p> <p>Maybe that's the thing about Wyman - that whatever Stone was thrown at him, he was always his own person. These days, he says, he's happier than he's ever been. With the new band, with a project about the blues for TV, with the second volume of his autobiography, with his kids. Therapy helped. Is he still in it? \"No. I only did it for six or seven visits. Just chatted to her for an hour each time. Felt a lot better afterwards. She said, 'Losses are quite big with you.' And I've had a lot. A lot when I wasn't there to deal with them, mourn, or what do you call it. Everyone dies, or things come to an end, when I'm not there. My grandma died when I was in the military. My dad died when I was on tour in Japan. My marriage to her ended when I was away.\" When he says \"her\" he points at me, presumably because I was the last person to mention Mandy Smith.</p> <p>What about his mum? Is she still alive? \"Oh yeah, she's full of bounce. A jolly old thing. She's as wide as she is tall. We're a pretty healthy family. My mum lost one tooth on an apple a few years ago and she's had one filling here\" - he opens his mouth to indicate the spot - \"and all the rest are her own teeth, and she's 83.\"</p> <p>And what about him? \"I've never been in hospital for anything except an appendix. Never had a major illness. No exercise. No dietary things, no vitaminy things. No special facial creams and all that garbage. I do all the wrong things and here I am.\"</p> <p>We both look at him. I nod towards the turndown in his trousers. \"Have you grown?\" I ask. He replies, \"Nah, that's the way they do them. Oh well, actually, no. What happened was I had these done by Boateng. I had about eight pairs done and I must have been wearing slippers, because when I got them back they were all, like, an inch too short. It was all right turning them down, but two pairs were corduroy and it shows, you see.\" We both study them again closely.</p> <p>\"Nah,\" he says, \"I haven't grown.\"</p>",

Perhaps the moat needs a lot of upkeep? \"We've got live fish in there,\" he says proudly. \"And wildfowl, ducks, geese. Of course we do.\" Odd that the working-class boy from Sydenham still seems to have something to prove. Si Si, Je Suis un Rock Star, his solo single from the early 80s, he says, \"was the most successful solo by any member of the Stones\". Playing in a charity cricket match at the Oval, he was the third person ever to take a hat-trick there. He's not a grandfather yet. \"The only Stone who isn't,\" he says with a chip of something. But, of course (to use his favourite word: \"Is it? Course it is.\" Big grin), he's not an old geezer at all. He's the father of three girls, \"and to them I'm just Dad\". He married his third wife, Suzanne Accosta, an actress and fashion designer, in 1993: \"She gave up her career. I gave up my bad habits.\" He knows the names of the Teletubbies. He gives tips on communicating long-distance to toddlers: \"I go, 'Di di di di, da da da' and she sings it back. You should try it.\" You could also almost call him a new man these days, though he looks baffled when this is suggested. \"New man? You mean like the shop? Do you know their sign? If you look at it upside down it still says New Man. It does. You should look.\" His eldest daughter, Katie, is five. Mandy Smith was 13 when he met her. They dated for two years before the press got hold of it, split up, and married, briefly, when she was 18. I wondered what Wyman would think if Katie was to date a 57-year-old in eight years' time? \"Won't happen,\" he says, \"because my Katie won't start going to pubs and clubs and night habitats when she's 10 so when she's 14 she won't look like a 20-year-old. That's the difference.\" Wyman is adept at moving swiftly on. \"I want them to be as normal as possible. I never encouraged my son to be a drummer or guitarist. I let him do what he wanted. And he did really well. He got 10 O levels, two A levels, maths and chemistry. And a degree, with honours, in business studies. So he turned out his own person.\" Maths? I say, impressed. \"Yeah, well, I'm good at maths, too,\" he says quickly. Maybe that's the thing about Wyman - that whatever Stone was thrown at him, he was always his own person. These days, he says, he's happier than he's ever been. With the new band, with a project about the blues for TV, with the second volume of his autobiography, with his kids. Therapy helped. Is he still in it? \"No. I only did it for six or seven visits. Just chatted to her for an hour each time. Felt a lot better afterwards. She said, 'Losses are quite big with you.' And I've had a lot. A lot when I wasn't there to deal with them, mourn, or what do you call it. Everyone dies, or things come to an end, when I'm not there. My grandma died when I was in the military. My dad died when I was on tour in Japan. My marriage to her ended when I was away.\" When he says \"her\" he points at me, presumably because I was the last person to mention Mandy Smith. What about his mum? Is she still alive? \"Oh yeah, she's full of bounce. A jolly old thing. She's as wide as she is tall. We're a pretty healthy family. My mum lost one tooth on an apple a few years ago and she's had one filling here\" - he opens his mouth to indicate the spot - \"and all the rest are her own teeth, and she's 83.\" And what about him? \"I've never been in hospital for anything except an appendix. Never had a major illness. No exercise. No dietary things, no vitaminy things. No special facial creams and all that garbage. I do all the wrong things and here I am.\" We both look at him. I nod towards the turndown in his trousers. \"Have you grown?\" I ask. He replies, \"Nah, that's the way they do them. Oh well, actually, no. What happened was I had these done by Boateng. I had about eight pairs done and I must have been wearing slippers, because when I got them back they were all, like, an inch too short. It was all right turning them down, but two pairs were corduroy and it shows, you see.\" We both study them again closely. \"Nah,\" he says, \"I haven't grown.\"",

      "bodyText": "DIY warehouse chain Wickes offered shareholders a \u00a374m sweetener yesterday to reject the hostile bid from rival Focus Do It All. The payout is the equivalent of \u00a31 a share and, said Wickes, would force the predator \"to put up or shut up\". Management fighting off the \u00a3285m offer tempted shareholders with a forecast of pre-interest and pre-tax profit for 2000 up to \u00a328.5m - an increase of 33% on 1999. Chief executive Bill Grimsey said the information in the latest circular to shareholders laid to rest the \"sniping\" by FDIA and shifted the argument back to the issue of value for shareholders. He said the company had \u00a341m in the bank which would cover some of the shareholders' pay-out. He claimed the company was planning to hand cash back to shareholders but admitted: \"the amount is a bit higher than we would have offered\". FDIA Finance, a subsidiary of Focus Do It All, made a cash bid for Wickes on March 30. It has claimed that Wickes's market position is under threat from Kingfisher's B&amp;Q and Sainsbury's Homebase. Mr Grimsey said yesterday: \"FDIA is looking to short-change our shareholders with its ludicrously low bid. Clearly we can more than match the value of FDIA's offer\". Wickes said that like for like sales rose 8.6% in the five weeks to May 6 compared with the same period in 1999.",

However, even the mildest of men has something that really riles them, and for Mervyn it is the suggestion that the Bank's monetary policy committee is divided into hawks and doves. Mervyn cuts up rough at this point. </p> <p>The Bank's deputy governor has a point. The MPC is focused on one thing and one thing only - hitting the government's 2.5% inflation target - and as such it is quite wrong to discriminate between hardliners and softies. But while \"hawks and doves\" has become a lazy shorthand, it is clear that there are serious and healthy disagreements on the MPC about how the economy works. </p> <p>The nub of the matter is this. Does the increase in average earnings growth and the strength of domestic demand mean that Britain is about to lapse into its bad old ways? Or is the really striking feature of the economy not that inflation is so high but that it is so low? </p> <p><strong> Pound not the full story</strong><br> After more than eight years of sustained growth, unemployment is at a 20-year low, yet inflation excluding mortgage interest payments has been below its target for more than a year. Partly, of course, this is due to the overvalued pound, which has made imports cheaper. But it is far from the whole story. As the Bank of England revealed in last week's inflation report, domestically-generated inflation has been steady at around 3% since 1998, so the fears that big City bonuses and rising house prices in London and the south-east would send inflation spiralling out of control seem to be wide of the mark. </p> <p>It is a similar story in the US. To be sure, the economy is steaming ahead and the tightness of the labour market is allowing workers to push up real wages, but competitive pressures mean that companies - even after the longest period of expansion in America's history - simply cannot make price increases stick. There are cyclical factors pushing inflation up, but there are structural factors dragging it down. Global deflation remains a threat, despite the recovery since the autumn of 1998. </p> <p>To understand that this is so, you need look no further than the world's second biggest economy, Japan. There, the economy has yet to recover from the collapse of an asset bubble in the late 80s and deflationary pressures are powerful. It is entirely possible that Japan could experience a 1930s-style slump. </p> <p>For the time being, there seems little prospect of Britain going the same way. With earnings growth at 6%, the Bank is worried about cost-push inflation, but whether these misgivings are justified or not remains to be been. It is unlikely that earnings are really growing at an underlying annual rate of 6%, and official data is unlikely to be picking up real improvements in productivity. It is notoriously difficult to estimate productivity in the service sector. </p> <p>Price pressures are strong in some sectors of the economy, but they are very weak in others. Inflation goes up when demand exceeds supply, but there is no reason to believe that this is what is currently happening. Business investment has risen sharply as a proportion of GDP in recent years and stands at around 14%, double its level in the 60s and higher even than in the US. Higher investment means extra capacity, which should mean lower not higher prices. </p> <p>The latest EU survey showed capacity utilisation in the UK running at 82%, below its 15-year average. Investment has been particularly strong in retailing, with stocks running at high levels and shops under pressure to discount to keep sales volumes up. Meanwhile, manufacturing is starting to feel the impact of sterling's strength, making it well-nigh impossible to pass on cost increases to customers. </p> <p>The MPC knows all this. It knows more about the economy than is probably good for it. But while there is unanimity about the need to hit the inflation target, there is a big debate about the transmission mechanism between activity in the real economy and inflation, and about how much attention should be given to movements in asset prices when setting interest rates. </p> <p><strong> Pay more attention</strong><br> A paper co-written by one of the MPC's members, Sushil Wadhwani, brings this debate into view. Asset Prices and Central Bank Policy (Cecchetti, Genberg, Lipsk and Wadhwani, CEPR) argues that if policymakers paid more heed to fluctuations in equity prices or exchange rates when making decisions they would reduce the fluctuations in both inflation and output. </p> <p>The authors note: \"Although asset price misalignments are difficult to measure, this should not be a reason to ignore them. We argue that there are situations where we can claim to spot misalignments and suggest measures to deal with them.\" </p> <p>The study falls short of calling for an explicit exchange rate target, but does say that failure to give proper weight to the level of sterling - and misplaced expectation that it is about to fall - has meant interest rates have been systematically pegged too high in recent years. </p> <p>\"Comparisons of these exchange-rate forecasts during the past four years with the subsequent outturns reveal persistent errors in the same direction, which may have led policymakers to set interest rates at too high a level.\" </p> <p>Industry would no doubt say three cheers to all that. But it will be interesting to see whether Mr Wadhwani's thinking is incorporated into the Bank's decision-making processes, because there are some on the MPC who are suspicious of this line of argument. The Bank's chief economist, John Vickers, wrote of the dangers last year of trying to hit more than one target, arguing that asset prices were already incorporated in the Bank's decision-making process. Some MPC members believe globalisation, the opening of new markets and the fading of the effects of the oil shocks of the 70s will have a far bigger impact on inflation than do others. </p> <p>So here's an idea. Let's stop talking about hawks and doves and take a leaf out of Peter Mandelson's book and re-classify the MPC according to whether or not they believe that life has moved on from the dark days of the 70s. </p> <p>It will be assumed that there is unanimity about the need to achieve low inflation - just as all members of the Labour Party believe in social justice -but those who feel that the battles from the 70s and 80s need to be refought will be called Old Bank, while those who want to move with the times and be tough on inflation and on the causes of inflation will be called New Bank.

A glance through the perimeter fence on the south of the site reveals small groups of unlikely looking buildings rapidly taking shape. These wooden mock-ups of wartime cities are the set for Steven Spielberg's follow-up to Saving Private Ryan. The latest Star Wars movie was shot at the nearby Leavesden studios - another former aerospace factory. Is this confirmation of the government's thesis that newer knowledge-based and cultural industries compensate for jobs lost in traditional employment? In Los Angeles, entertainment-related jobs have soared to an estimated 800,000 in 1999.

      "bodyText": "The news that pharmaceutical companies are reducing their costs and helping to ensure that their drugs become more affordable (Boost for Aids fight, May 12) is a good step, but it is only one part of the jigsaw. If these treatments are to be of real benefit there also needs to be access to quality medical and other health care support - and stronger political leadership to deal with the stigma and denial which presents significant barriers to prevention and care efforts. Derek Bodell Chief executive, National Aids Trust \u0095 Bringing down the cost of Aids drugs for Africa will not work unless combined with an intensive programme of education and support at community level, informing people of the dangers of HIV/Aids and how to protect themselves, and offering help to children orphaned in the pandemic. In Kenya, where 350 people die every day from Aids-related complications, Plan has found that community involvement to increase understanding of HIV/Aids and how it is spread is helping to reduce the stigma surrounding the disease. It is also empowering communities to care for the orphans HIV/Aids is leaving behind. Community education is vital if children in countries like Kenya are to face a more optimistic future. Since many Kenyans will be unable to afford even the cheaper drugs, it is also our best weapon in fighting the spread of the disease. Marie Staunton Chief executive, Plan International \u0095 While welcoming the decision to cut the cost of HIV treatments to developing countries, this is the first step in a long-term solution. Elementary needs such as access to adequate food, clean water and a well structured and funded health care system must be in place for the full benefits of this price-cut to have any real impact. Even at reduced prices, few developing countries will be able to afford to provide the drugs to everyone who needs them. Nick Partridge Chief executive, Terrence Higgins Trust \u0095 Still missing from the equation is access to cheaper basic medicines that can substantially improve the quality of life for those suffering from HIV/Aids and related illnesses. Simple treatments such as antibiotics and painkillers could go a long way in enabling people with Aids to live healthier and more economically active lives if they were available. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/Aids is killing development and this could be the most important link to social and economic recovery. Africa clearly has the greatest need, but all developing countries should have the right to the same opportunities for confronting this epidemic. The people with whom 2,000 VSO volunteers share their skills all over the world see the impacts of this disease on their colleagues and neighbours every day. UNaids and the pharmaceutical industry should extend their good will to looking for sustainable solutions for all Aids sufferers. Mark Goldring Chief executive, Voluntary Service Overseas",

Half the rows were the same, and in half just one of the letters was different. The volunteers had to classify as many rows as possible as \"the same\" or \"different\" in the space of 30 seconds. Again, non-users outperformed the two ecstasy user groups. In both animals and humans ecstasy has been shown to destroy nerve endings in the brain responsible for producing the important message transmitter chemical serotonin.",

The strike by 4,000 guards follows a recent increase in violent attacks on armoured vans. Last week several hundred guards attended the funeral of a colleague shot dead during a robbery in Grenoble. A day later, an attack on a van in Nanterre, west of Paris, left three more badly wounded. In the past six months three guards have been killed and a dozen injured in 10 attacks. The robbers are using increasingly dangerous and sophisticated methods: in Marseille in December, masked assailants fled with \u00a31.4m after firing a shoulder-launched missile at a security van. \"We're just not prepared to carry on getting killed for such a miserable reward,\" a union organiser, Ren\u00e9 Baralys, said, pointing out that newly recruited guards take home less than \u00a3600 a month. Mr Baralys, 52, survived having a gun held to his head during a two-hour hostage-taking and a machine-gun attack in Marseille in which two colleagues died. In Nice in 1995, a dynamite attack on his van paralysed a colleague from the waist down. \"It used to be that all we had to worry about was small-time yobs,\" he said. \"But these days it's organised, large-scale gangs. They have Kalashnikovs, rocket-launchers and dynamite. They can easily walk away with more than \u00a32m for a single hold-up.\" The guards are demanding an extra \u00a3150 a month danger money, more efficient bullet-proof jackets, better reinforced vans, and official recognition of their profession as dangerous - which would entitle them to earlier retirement and other benefits. The security firms say that the business is not profitable and that the guards' demands would cost them \u00a310m a year. \"We understand and sympathise with their complaints,\" said Jean-Michel Haury of Brink's. \"But if we're going to meet their demands, the government and our clients will have to help.\"",

The answers lie in his good fortune in possessing so many of the attributes which an effective politician needs in Japan, and against which the shortcomings mentioned above pale into insignificance.</p> <p>First, he was lucky enough to be born a male, in a political system where, typically, his first cabinet, in July 1998, contained the usual solitary token female. Second, he was fortunate enough to have a politician for a father, whose support network he could inherit. Third, he was affable, a good listener and so practised in consensus-building that it seemed like second nature. Fourth, he could hide his considerable abilities behind a mask of ordinariness and, hence, put people at their ease.</p> <p>Obuchi was born in rural Gunma prefecture, a heartland of conservative politics in Japan. In 1958, he entered Waseda, a top private university in Tokyo, majoring in English literature. While there, he kept fit by taking aikido classes, and practised oratory in the speech club - though his later career removed all traces of these pursuits.</p> <p>After graduation in 1962, Obuchi was inclined to stay on at Waseda and take a higher degree in politics, but dropped out after a few months and went abroad to travel. In later life, he often recalled meeting Robert Kennedy on the American leg of his round-the-world trip, and claimed that this inspired him to become a politician. This was probably a rationalisation of a career choice that social pressures and family expectations made virtually unavoidable.</p> <p>Obuchi returned to Japan in September 1963, and went straight into an election campaign in the Gunma third constituency. Although two formidable Liberal Democratic party politicians, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Takeo Fukuda (both of whom went on to become prime minister) were in the contest, the multi-member system allowed Obuchi to be elected along side his seniors - he once described himself as \"a noodle shop between two skyscrapers\". At 26, he became the youngest representative in the lower house of the Japanese national assembly.</p> <p>From then on, Obuchi's progress was impeccably conventional. The multi-member constituency system meant that he had to join a different LDP faction to Nakasone's and Fukuda's. The faction he ended up in was that of Kakuei Tanaka, who continued as godfather of the LDP even after being convicted in 1983 for his part in the Lockheed scandal. Tanaka's faction remained the largest and most powerful group within the LDP throughout successive changes of leadership, first to Noboru Takeshita and then to Obuchi himself.</p> <p>In addition to working his way up in his faction, Obuchi met all the other requirements of a rising LDP politician. Consistent delivery of material benefits to his constituency meant that he was returned in 12 successive elections, and he occupied, in turn, all the key positions which together serve as apprenticeship for the top job. These included chief cabinet secretary in 1987, party secretary-general in 1991 and minister of foreign affairs in 1997.</p> <p>Obuchi's turn eventually came in July 1998, when Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned after taking responsibility for the LDP's poor performance in the upper house election. Among the general public, Obuchi was the least popular candidate for the LDP presidency, but with the votes of the third largest faction, led by Kiichi Miyazawa, to add to his own support, the result was not in doubt. Obuchi repaid Miyazawa with the finance ministry, and the make-up of his cabinet dutifully reflected the factional balance within the party, his own faction and Miyazawa's getting five posts each.</p> <p>In a sense, Obuchi wrote his own political obituary when he declared, in his first policy speech, that he was determined to set the Japanese economy on the path to recovery - this was the yardstick by which he invited judgment. Twenty months and two enormous emergency economic packages later, the economy remains on its knees, unemployment is higher than ever and government indebtedness stands at 125% of GDP.</p> <p>None of this should be put down to Obuchi's inadequacy. He was a superlative practitioner of politics Japanese-style, and had considerable personal charm. But the qualities that brought him the top job ensured that he would be a link in a chain, not someone to sever the chain that binds Japan.</p> <p>He and his wife Chizuko had a son and two daughters.</p> <p>Keizo Obuchi, politician, born June 25 1937; died May 14 2000</p>",

In later life, he often recalled meeting Robert Kennedy on the American leg of his round-the-world trip, and claimed that this inspired him to become a politician. This was probably a rationalisation of a career choice that social pressures and family expectations made virtually unavoidable. Obuchi returned to Japan in September 1963, and went straight into an election campaign in the Gunma third constituency. Although two formidable Liberal Democratic party politicians, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Takeo Fukuda (both of whom went on to become prime minister) were in the contest, the multi-member system allowed Obuchi to be elected along side his seniors - he once described himself as \"a noodle shop between two skyscrapers\". At 26, he became the youngest representative in the lower house of the Japanese national assembly. From then on, Obuchi's progress was impeccably conventional. The multi-member constituency system meant that he had to join a different LDP faction to Nakasone's and Fukuda's. The faction he ended up in was that of Kakuei Tanaka, who continued as godfather of the LDP even after being convicted in 1983 for his part in the Lockheed scandal. Tanaka's faction remained the largest and most powerful group within the LDP throughout successive changes of leadership, first to Noboru Takeshita and then to Obuchi himself. In addition to working his way up in his faction, Obuchi met all the other requirements of a rising LDP politician. Consistent delivery of material benefits to his constituency meant that he was returned in 12 successive elections, and he occupied, in turn, all the key positions which together serve as apprenticeship for the top job. These included chief cabinet secretary in 1987, party secretary-general in 1991 and minister of foreign affairs in 1997. Obuchi's turn eventually came in July 1998, when Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned after taking responsibility for the LDP's poor performance in the upper house election. Among the general public, Obuchi was the least popular candidate for the LDP presidency, but with the votes of the third largest faction, led by Kiichi Miyazawa, to add to his own support, the result was not in doubt. Obuchi repaid Miyazawa with the finance ministry, and the make-up of his cabinet dutifully reflected the factional balance within the party, his own faction and Miyazawa's getting five posts each. In a sense, Obuchi wrote his own political obituary when he declared, in his first policy speech, that he was determined to set the Japanese economy on the path to recovery - this was the yardstick by which he invited judgment. Twenty months and two enormous emergency economic packages later, the economy remains on its knees, unemployment is higher than ever and government indebtedness stands at 125% of GDP. None of this should be put down to Obuchi's inadequacy. He was a superlative practitioner of politics Japanese-style, and had considerable personal charm. But the qualities that brought him the top job ensured that he would be a link in a chain, not someone to sever the chain that binds Japan. He and his wife Chizuko had a son and two daughters. Keizo Obuchi, politician, born June 25 1937; died May 14 2000",

      "body": "<p>For a change the final whistle was greeted with cheers from Spurs fans rather than the jeers that have echoed around the ground at many games this season. </p> <p>Yet the glorious sunshine and the party atmosphere did little to disguise the disappointment of Tottenham's campaign. </p> <p>George Graham admitted as much after the game as he prepared for a summer holiday that will be followed by a major rebuilding job. </p> <p>\"Of course I am a little disappointed,\" he said. \"In the second half of the season we really dropped off and we had a bad time. But there are a lot of good things happening at this club and we are optimistic for next season.\" </p> <p>By contrast, Sunderland will look back with satisfaction on their first season back in the top flight, despite this defeat. Peter Reid's task appears much less daunting than that facing his north London counterpart. </p> <p>There was no lacklustre end-of-season feel to this game despite the fact that both teams were playing only for honour. </p> <p>As well as the four goals there was a red card for Alex Rae, who hit out at David Ginola and will now miss the start of next season on suspension, plus bitter disappointment for Steffen Iversen. </p> <p>Graham said after the match that the Norway striker, who was substituted at half-time, would miss Euro 2000 because of a recurrence of a leg injury. </p> <p>Tottenham once again demonstrated their capacity for valuing commercialism above tradition as they opted to wear next season's new away kit in an attempt to boost sales. </p> <p>This no doubt pleased the Spurs chairman Alan Sugar, who had something else to smile about when his team took the lead after 11 minutes from a Darren Anderton penalty.

      "bodyText": "For a change the final whistle was greeted with cheers from Spurs fans rather than the jeers that have echoed around the ground at many games this season. Yet the glorious sunshine and the party atmosphere did little to disguise the disappointment of Tottenham's campaign. George Graham admitted as much after the game as he prepared for a summer holiday that will be followed by a major rebuilding job. \"Of course I am a little disappointed,\" he said. \"In the second half of the season we really dropped off and we had a bad time. But there are a lot of good things happening at this club and we are optimistic for next season.\" By contrast, Sunderland will look back with satisfaction on their first season back in the top flight, despite this defeat. Peter Reid's task appears much less daunting than that facing his north London counterpart. There was no lacklustre end-of-season feel to this game despite the fact that both teams were playing only for honour. As well as the four goals there was a red card for Alex Rae, who hit out at David Ginola and will now miss the start of next season on suspension, plus bitter disappointment for Steffen Iversen. Graham said after the match that the Norway striker, who was substituted at half-time, would miss Euro 2000 because of a recurrence of a leg injury. Tottenham once again demonstrated their capacity for valuing commercialism above tradition as they opted to wear next season's new away kit in an attempt to boost sales. This no doubt pleased the Spurs chairman Alan Sugar, who had something else to smile about when his team took the lead after 11 minutes from a Darren Anderton penalty. It was a controversial spot kick, given that Paul Butler appeared to have brought down Chris Armstrong just outside the Sunderland box. The visitors felt hard done by and continued pressing forward. They were justifiably rewarded nine minutes later when Chris Makin surged past a flat-footed Ledley King, who was making his full Tottenham debut, and then slotted the ball home. With the heat increasing and noise levels rising, both teams set about each other as if they had something crucial to play for. \"The lads could have just gone out there and strolled around,\" said Graham. \"Considering there was not a lot at stake it was a very good, entertaining game. The crowd was really up for it.\" Spurs managed to edge ahead midway through the second half when Tim Sherwood, making a return from injury, was able to get on to the end of a Sol Campbell header and tuck the ball away. The Sunderland marksman Kevin Phillips had an unusually quiet game and was well shackled all afternoon by the impressive Chris Perry. It was left to the Spurs full- back Stephen Carr to steal the prize for goal of the day . With the visitors searching for an equaliser, Spurs managed to hit them on the break and Carr beat off two challenges to lob the ball into Thomas Sorensen's top right hand corner. It was a spectacular finish to mark a spectacular season for the Irish defender.",

Neil Smith started the procession, enticing Will House to pop up a catch to Dougie Brown at silly point on the third ball of the day. The Warwickshire captain then ousted the seamer Jason Lewry, for a career-best 39, and the wicket-keeper Shaun Humphries. It fell to Ed Giddins, celebrating a well-deserved test recall, to finish off the one-sided affair, scattering James Kirtley's stumps with a swift yorker. No question about that dismissal, then.",

And Shearer was eager to reach his personal landmark before heading to Euro 2000 with England. </p> <p>He made it to 300 with Newcastle's second goal, a typically explosive free-kick through an unconvincing Arsenal wall which parted obligingly. It has taken Shearer a little over 12 seasons to get to his triple century, a formidable record for a striker who has had serious injury problems. </p> <p>Bobby Robson led the tributes. \"It's a phenomenal feat,\" said the man who has worked with forwards such as Ronaldo, Romario and Gary Lineker. \"He's up there with them, he's in that cluster,\" the Newcastle manager added. </p> <p>Shearer commented: \"I'm a very proud man.

In the first instance the midfielder made a typically forceful run to meet Shearer's overhead pass with a first-time shot in the sixth minute. </p> <p>Arsenal levelled it within 45 seconds, however, when Davor Suker, eager for a goal in what is likely to be his final appearance for the club, had to settle for setting up Kanu, who lobbed Shay Given. The visitors also responded to Shearer's goal when Stefan Malz held off Warren Barton to score stylishly in the 53rd minute, but Newcastle took charge with two goals in five minutes. </p> <p>Speed was given ample space to head in Nol Solano's corner in the 59th minute before Andy Griffin, playing his first game since being injured in last season's FA Cup final, steered in the fourth. </p> <p>\"It was a good opportunity to give a run to some of our young players. I can foresee some of them challenging for first-team places next season,\" said Wenger, who gave debuts to Ashley Cole and Rhys Weston. </p> <p>\u0095 Steve Clarke, the former Chelsea defender and Ruud Gullit's first signing when he took over in August 1998, is to step down from his post as senior coach at Newcastle.

In the first instance the midfielder made a typically forceful run to meet Shearer's overhead pass with a first-time shot in the sixth minute. Arsenal levelled it within 45 seconds, however, when Davor Suker, eager for a goal in what is likely to be his final appearance for the club, had to settle for setting up Kanu, who lobbed Shay Given. The visitors also responded to Shearer's goal when Stefan Malz held off Warren Barton to score stylishly in the 53rd minute, but Newcastle took charge with two goals in five minutes. Speed was given ample space to head in Nol Solano's corner in the 59th minute before Andy Griffin, playing his first game since being injured in last season's FA Cup final, steered in the fourth. \"It was a good opportunity to give a run to some of our young players. I can foresee some of them challenging for first-team places next season,\" said Wenger, who gave debuts to Ashley Cole and Rhys Weston. \u0095 Steve Clarke, the former Chelsea defender and Ruud Gullit's first signing when he took over in August 1998, is to step down from his post as senior coach at Newcastle. Peter Beardsley is expected to be offered a job as a youth coach.",

Insiders say a deal is imminent to end Whitbread's 250-year involvement in the beer making industry. Unless a last minute hitch emerges, the disposal of Whitbread's brewing operation could be announced some time this week. The move is part of a strategic review by Whitbread's chief executive, David Thomas - who has watched the company's shares fall by half during the last year. Mr Thomas wants to concentrate on faster growing operations, such as health clubs and budget hotels. Whitbread is Britain's third largest brewer after Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Bass. The sale will include breweries in Manchester, Salmesbury in Lancashire and Magor in Wales, along with two regional distribution centres and 17 satellite sites, employing a total of 4,500 people. The bulk of Whitbread's production is of Heineken and Stella Artois - which it brews under licence for the European brand owners. The company also produces Boddingtons, Murphys, Wadworth 6X and a variety of beers designed to serve smaller niche markets. Mr Thomas hinted at a sale of the brewing operation during Whitbread's annual results briefing some two weeks ago, when he said that consolidation in the brewing industry \"could well create an opportunity for us to add value for Whitbread shareholders\". Among the other potential buyers rumoured to be interested were Heineken and a management buyout team, led by the Whitbread Beer Company's managing director, Miles Templeman. However, sources close to the negotiations for the brewing operation's sale confirmed yesterday that Interbrew had emerged as \"the leading contender\", and that hopes were high regarding a swift conclusion to the talks. A Whitbread spokesman declined to comment, but the group is likely to be keen for a smooth resolution after failing in its last strategic move - an attempt to buy Allied Domecq's pub estate last year. Following the transaction attention is likely to shift to Bass - which is also keen to exit the brewing industry.

      "bodyText": "Halifax will start offering more than 10,000 mortgage brokers and millions of potential homebuyers an online decision for a home loan within 60 seconds today. The former building society, which sold a record \u00a317.8bn of mortgages last year, will also enable customers to track the progress of mortgage applications on the internet. The bank is developing two internet products, Halifax Online and Intelligent Finance; The latter had 5,000 applications last Monday for its new accounts which are being launched in June. Halifax claims its online mortgage promise, launched today, is a first among mortgage lenders, but a tracking service is already offered by some brokers, including the largest, John Charcol. The Halifax tracking system available in the summer, will enable customers and brokers to see when the bank has received the valuation report, confirmation of the customer's salary and whether the mortgage has been offered. The Halifax move is the latest development in a race by the leading financial services companies to enhance their internet offerings. Abbey National has also pledged to speed up the process of home buying with a similar on-line offering which it has spent \u00a35m developing.",

In selecting my Premiership team of the year, however, I prefer to start from the front, with Sunderland's Kevin Phillips and Arsenal's Thierry Henry. There aren't many back four men - particularly full-backs or wing-backs - who spring to mind as having had exceptional seasons so the focus begins up front.</p> <p> The obvious reason for my selection of Phillips and Henry is that they have scored more goals than even Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole at Manchester United. Phillips has become only the third player to get 30 Premiership goals in a season while Henry, who joined Arsenal as a winger last summer and was only switched to the central striking role in November, has scored 26. </p> <p>Henry's part in helping Arsenal to this season's Uefa Cup final and next season's Champions League is reflected by a superb recent record of at least one goal in each of his last 10 matches. Phillips has had to struggle to get where is he today, having been released by Southampton as a boy - when he was a right-back - and dropping into non-league football before getting another chance at Watford. This shows in his enthusiasm and his determination to make the most of his career. </p> <p>There's no doubt a lot of promising youngsters can get too much success and praise too early. Phillips is a good example of the benefits of not having been 'spoilt'. In terms of attitude, I cannot think of a striker who has produced a better performance than he did in Sunderland's match at Coventry. He reminded me of Ian Rush, who was noted not just for the goals he scored for Liverpoool and Wales but for his work rate off the ball. </p> <p>Whenever Liverpool lost possession deep in the opposing half, he was usually the player who would start their effort to get it back. He was probably the striker who best epitomised that old football concept of 'defending from the front'. </p> <p>In that department, Phillips was no less prominent against us - even when we were 3-0 ahead. It was largely down to his example that Sunderland made it 3-2 (he deservedly scored their first goal), and came close to salvaging a point. </p> <p>Technically, the great things about him are that he has what we call exceptionally 'quick feet', and can adjust himself into good shooting positions as expertly as anyone. Quite apart from being able to hit them in from both inside and outside the box, he is not bad in the air, either, for someone of his height. </p> <p>Henry, who could never be described as anything but a top-class player when he operated on the wing, seems to be even better as a central striker. The irony, of course, is that he has appeared a more natural scorer than any of the men who filled the central striking roles in France's 1998 World Cup-winning team. </p> <p>His pace is frightening, and for that reason alone, it is easy to appreciate why Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, felt he would be an ideal replacement for Nicolas Anelka. Interestingly, Wenger has recently gone on record as saying that he considers Henry to be even quicker than Anelka and that other speed merchant, Marc Overmars, over 40 yards. </p> <p>The big advantage of having someone like that in England is that opposing teams get quite neurotic about leaving too much space behind their defence. It forces them to think twice about pushing up and squeezing the play. That teams facing Arsenal tend to defend 10-15 yards deeper than they would against other sides means that the Gunners get greater scope to strike an effective rhythm in their build-up play. </p> <p>Of all the other players I have chosen, I guess that the one that might create the most surprise is Marcel Desailly. He himself has been quoted as saying that he has not been entirely happy in the Premiership; and I have to admit that if I could have my pick of any of France's World Cup defenders, I would have to bypass both Desailly and his Chelsea colleague Frank Leboeuf in favour of Parma's Lillian Thuram. Who knows, if the rumours are true, he might be playing in the Premiership next season.</p> <p>But Desailly has been a tremendous asset to Chelsea in the Champions League.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> The government is to introduce performance-related pay for hospitals in an attempt to raise standards in the NHS. </p> <p>Under plans being drawn up by the Department of Health, top performing hospitals will receive significant cash rewards for reducing waiting times and cutting the number of cancelled operations. Ministers are considering forcing hospitals to publish how they perform in a prospectus, which will also include information on cleanliness and quality of food. </p> <p>So far, \u00a360 million has been allocated to the performance pay scheme, but officials say that is just 'dipping a toe in the water'. A further \u00a310m is to be announced this week to encourage hospitals to combat heart disease. This is the first time the Department of Health has distributed money solely on the basis of performance targets. </p> <p>Health Secretary Alan Milburn has been particularly concerned that under-performing hospitals have virtually no incentive to catch up with better ones. Studies show that two hospitals in the same area with the same level of funding can have radically different levels of efficiency. The new measures are part of the National Plan to modernise the NHS, which will be announced in July. The National Plan - made in consultation with doctors and the public - is aimed at getting the best out of the rise in health spending announced recently by Chancellor Gordon Brown. </p> <p>Officials have already drawn up the criteria for the cash top-ups. They include: inpatient and outpatient waiting times; being fully prepared for winter; number of cancelled operations; delayed discharges; number of trolley waits in accident and emergency; and whether they have implemented a sound financial management system. </p> <p>The \u00a310m to be announced this week will reward 22 projects solely on the basis of good performance at improving prevention and treatment of heart disease. Those winning the money include an electronic heart disease register for tracking people at risk, rapid-access chest pain clinics, as well as food co-ops that provide cheap vegetables in impoverished neighbourhoods, and a cooking club to encourage healthy eating. </p> <p>Performance-related pay for hospitals will be backed by the new Commission for Health Improvement - described by Tony Blair as an Ofsted for the health service - which wills end teams of inspectors into hospitals. Those that do well will get the cash payments, while those that are failing could have teams of managers sent in. </p> <p>Officials see the new hospital prospectuses as a way to help local people pressure their hospitals into better performance.

      "bodyText": "The government is to introduce performance-related pay for hospitals in an attempt to raise standards in the NHS. Under plans being drawn up by the Department of Health, top performing hospitals will receive significant cash rewards for reducing waiting times and cutting the number of cancelled operations. Ministers are considering forcing hospitals to publish how they perform in a prospectus, which will also include information on cleanliness and quality of food. So far, \u00a360 million has been allocated to the performance pay scheme, but officials say that is just 'dipping a toe in the water'. A further \u00a310m is to be announced this week to encourage hospitals to combat heart disease. This is the first time the Department of Health has distributed money solely on the basis of performance targets. Health Secretary Alan Milburn has been particularly concerned that under-performing hospitals have virtually no incentive to catch up with better ones. Studies show that two hospitals in the same area with the same level of funding can have radically different levels of efficiency. The new measures are part of the National Plan to modernise the NHS, which will be announced in July. The National Plan - made in consultation with doctors and the public - is aimed at getting the best out of the rise in health spending announced recently by Chancellor Gordon Brown. Officials have already drawn up the criteria for the cash top-ups. They include: inpatient and outpatient waiting times; being fully prepared for winter; number of cancelled operations; delayed discharges; number of trolley waits in accident and emergency; and whether they have implemented a sound financial management system. The \u00a310m to be announced this week will reward 22 projects solely on the basis of good performance at improving prevention and treatment of heart disease. Those winning the money include an electronic heart disease register for tracking people at risk, rapid-access chest pain clinics, as well as food co-ops that provide cheap vegetables in impoverished neighbourhoods, and a cooking club to encourage healthy eating. Performance-related pay for hospitals will be backed by the new Commission for Health Improvement - described by Tony Blair as an Ofsted for the health service - which wills end teams of inspectors into hospitals. Those that do well will get the cash payments, while those that are failing could have teams of managers sent in. Officials see the new hospital prospectuses as a way to help local people pressure their hospitals into better performance. The Department of Health has no plans to publish league tables for hospitals as the Department for Education and Employment does for schools, but information enabling others to do so will be publicly available. In a speech to the Royal College of Surgeons on Thursday, Milburn will stress how he sees the approach as essential for improving standards. He is expected to say: 'It is neither fair on taxpayers or patients that too often good performance and bad performance sit side by side in the NHS.' anthony.browne@observer.co.uk",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At least one Villa player is confident about next week's FA Cup final. 'The pressure lies with Chelsea. It will be very special,' he says. But George Boateng believes his club will have bigger fish to fry in the future. He dares to suggest that Aston Villa will be competing in the Champions League within two years. </p> <p>Boateng is all smiles and laughter at Villa's training ground despite the pre-Wembley trials and tribulations. Why the confidence? It could be that Villa's manager, John Gregory, is taking him seriously. </p> <p>With all his clubs, it has taken Boateng time to convince the coach that he is a central midfielder. At Villa, for the first time in his career the 24-year-old Dutchman feels completely at ease. The energetic ball-winner and fiery tackler has earned the privilege to operate in his favourite position, feels respected by the management and loved by the fans. Boateng was born in Ghana, lived in Accra with his mother until he was 10 and then moved to Holland to join his father, who lived near Rotterdam. He made his debut in Feyenoord's elite at 16, but it took another two years before he was a regular. In 1997 he left for Coventry to develop himself in a central midfield position. </p> <p>'The Feyenoord manager fielded me wherever he needed someone. I had suddenly made a name for myself as a defender,' says the former Dutch Under-21 captain. 'But I believed I would have a lot more to offer in midfield. I saw my friend and team-mate Giovanni van Bronckhorst grow in that position and I thought I could do the same.' </p> <p>Halfway through the 97-98 season he had had offers from Udinese and Deportivo La Coruna, but he chose relegation candidates Coventry because of manager Gordon Strachan. 'This great former player convinced me when he said he needed midfielders and gave me his word that I would play there.' The \u00a3250,000 Coventry paid for the youngster immediately proved a bargain - an inspired performance made him man of the match in his debut against Liverpool and later when he guided the team away from relegation danger. </p> <p>'Finally I could show what I had had in mind all those years.

      "bodyText": "At least one Villa player is confident about next week's FA Cup final. 'The pressure lies with Chelsea. It will be very special,' he says. But George Boateng believes his club will have bigger fish to fry in the future. He dares to suggest that Aston Villa will be competing in the Champions League within two years. Boateng is all smiles and laughter at Villa's training ground despite the pre-Wembley trials and tribulations. Why the confidence? It could be that Villa's manager, John Gregory, is taking him seriously. With all his clubs, it has taken Boateng time to convince the coach that he is a central midfielder. At Villa, for the first time in his career the 24-year-old Dutchman feels completely at ease. The energetic ball-winner and fiery tackler has earned the privilege to operate in his favourite position, feels respected by the management and loved by the fans. Boateng was born in Ghana, lived in Accra with his mother until he was 10 and then moved to Holland to join his father, who lived near Rotterdam. He made his debut in Feyenoord's elite at 16, but it took another two years before he was a regular. In 1997 he left for Coventry to develop himself in a central midfield position. 'The Feyenoord manager fielded me wherever he needed someone. I had suddenly made a name for myself as a defender,' says the former Dutch Under-21 captain. 'But I believed I would have a lot more to offer in midfield. I saw my friend and team-mate Giovanni van Bronckhorst grow in that position and I thought I could do the same.' Halfway through the 97-98 season he had had offers from Udinese and Deportivo La Coruna, but he chose relegation candidates Coventry because of manager Gordon Strachan. 'This great former player convinced me when he said he needed midfielders and gave me his word that I would play there.' The \u00a3250,000 Coventry paid for the youngster immediately proved a bargain - an inspired performance made him man of the match in his debut against Liverpool and later when he guided the team away from relegation danger. 'Finally I could show what I had had in mind all those years. I even started to surprise myself. When I saw myself on television I thought I was watching someone else. I had always known my worth to a team hugely depended on spirit and agility. I had never been one to dribble past three or four players to score a spectacular goal, but I even started doing that. The reason was my growing confidence and the trust that the manager put in me.' That things turned ugly just a year later still bewilders Boateng, just as it does Stra chan, who has a different version of events. 'My relationship with Strachan had always been good.

      "body": "<p> I don't go on planes. I haven't been on one for 10 years and would be quite happy to see out the next decade in a similar fashion. So, when I accepted the job of directing Anna Karenina for Channel 4, to be filmed entirely on location in Poland and Finland, I knew that getting there would be part of the challenge. </p> <p>If you'd asked me then how to travel from my home in Dumfriesshire to Helsinki solely by public transport, or, indeed, if it was even possible, I wouldn't have had a clue. Expecting an argument about the perceived eccentricities of my travel arrangements - why the hell should I fly? Dennis Bergkamp doesn't; neither does the hero of TV's The A-Team, B.A. Baracus ('I ain't goin' on no damn plane, fool!') - I was reluctant to completely commit to the job. </p> <p>'Charlie,' I said to the producer, as we sat discussing the contract. 'Look, there's something we need to talk about...' He cut me off immediately. 'You're leaving on the 12 o'clock from Waterloo. You arrive in Warsaw at 9am the next morning. Your tickets are booked.' So, that was it; no more excuses. I was on my way. </p> <p>Though we filmed the vast majority of Anna Karenina in Poland, February brought an unexpected thaw to Warsaw and the need to change to a colder location. The -20 C that we'd been told to expect never materialised, and it was simply not cold enough to shoot one vital scene involving two of the main characters, Levin and Kitty, meeting on an ice rink in the street. </p> <p>The producers decided to move us to Finland. The temperatures were due to be between -3 and -10 ; cold enough for our purposes. We scheduled in two days filming in Helsinki. My flightless journey there would begin at my Scottish home very early on a Monday morning and end 2,000 miles later in the Finnish capital on Wednesday, in time to film the next day. I'm told it took even longer to book. Lisa, my assistant, used seven different travel agents over four days. </p> <p>It's a 16-mile car journey from my home in Tynron to the railway station in Dumfries. From there, I made my way to Carlisle and then on to London, where I was due to catch the Eurostar from Waterloo to Brussels. It was great to know that all the arrangements had been made for me; that my route was mapped out and that all my tickets were booked and paid for. I could just sit back, relax and enjoy the jour ney. What a job! Remind me to direct more big-budget lavish costume dramas. </p> <p>From Brussels, my trajectory would take me into and across Germany, to Denmark, on through Sweden and then, finally, across the Baltic Sea to Finland. Some of my changeover times between trains were very tight; only 12 minutes in Brussels and 14 minutes in Cologne. In fact, the train I was meant to get from Cologne to Hamburg was running 25 minutes late, which meant I would have missed my connection at the other end. A nice German lady spotted me scouring the timetable in a bewildered search. She very kindly pointed me in the direction of another train that would actually get me to Hamburg 40 minutes earlier. I found it on the other side of the station. </p> <p> An amazing beast, the Metropolitan was an exclusive train catering for businessmen. A quarter of each carriage was an office and, once I'd paid my supplement of 30 marks (about \u00a39.20) to ensure a place, I really felt as though I should take my shoes off; it was so clean and comfortable. You wouldn't get this sort of service on the Dumfries to Carlisle route, I can tell you. </p> <p>Settled into my luxurious surroundings, I was free to admire the stunning sight of Cologne cathedral rising up in front of me at the end of the platform. I think that, of all the many staggering things I saw along a very interesting journey, this is the one that will stay with me most. There is something quite surprising about the way in which this amazing piece of religious architecture looks as though it has just been plonked at the end of a railway platform. For a moment you wonder which, like the chicken and egg, came first: the cathedral or the platform? </p> <p>Other memories stand out almost dream-like from that long journey across Germany; a collage of feelings and sights garnered through the windows of moving trains. In D\u00fcsseldorf, I looked out of the window and saw what seemed to be a block of flats with big square windows and, by the bottom left-hand corner of each window, a number drawn in white paint. Behind the windows, I could just make out rows of women, clad in scanty underwear; prostitutes in a high-rise brothel. Quite a different take on sexual politics from that in Anna Karenina . </p> <p>One overriding impression I gained as the trains passed through Dortmund, D\u00fcsseldorf, Cologne and then on through Bremen, Essen and Duisburg to Hamburg, is that the world has been taken over by McDonald's. That universal yellow 'M' hung in each of these cities, normally close to the stations - one of the first things any traveller would see on arrival. Warsaw too, had one. And I was greeted, upon my return to Dumfries, by a brand new 'M' hanging above a brand new restaurant, like some evil talisman. Nowhere is safe. </p> <p>I learnt just how thorough the Germans are about their Customs points. No one ever asked to see my passport in Denmark or Sweden, but on entering and leaving Germany I was given the full treatment: roused from sleep by torchlight in my face, a big burly man standing over me, demanding to see my passport. I felt I was in some Steve McQueen movie. </p> <p>As I moved from country to country, I started to realise just how convenient the euro could be. By the time I got to Helsinki, my pockets were full of Belgian francs, marks, Danish kroner, Swedish krona and Finnish markka. The coins get everywhere, like sand. I'm still finding them, weeks later. </p> <p> The Metropolitan arrived in Hamburg at about 7.30pm on the Monday. The next leg was across the sea to Copenhagen. Not quite knowing what would happen at this point, I was surprised when the train ran straight on to the boat. There was a long echo throughout the hold of the ship as we hooked onto couplings and then, that was it. Passengers are free to get off and go to one of the ship's many bars and restaurants, or just stay on the train. Looking at the huge tethered locomotive, rolling in the opposite direction to the ship as the water got choppier, I was quite glad I had chosen to get off. The idea of getting seasick on a train was just a bit too surreal for me. </p> <p>I stayed over in Copenhagen that night. It is a beautiful city, and I could have happily stayed longer, but my thoughts were on arriving for the shoot, so early next morning, I boarded a catamaran for the 45-minute ride to Malmo in Sweden. A lot of people commute from Malmo, which is a fairly small fishing town, over the water to the Danish capital. I was quite struck by the idea of commuting from one country to another, with a different language and different customs. Then I thought about travelling from Dumfries to London, and realised that I do exactly the same. </p> <p>In Malmo, I boarded a train for Stockholm, whence I would pick up the boat that would take me on the final leg of my journey, across the frozen Baltic to Helsinki. I could feel it getting colder, the further north I went. Everywhere I looked in Sweden, I saw tree felling and realised what an important part wood plays in the lives of Swedes. All along the four-and-a-half-hour journey I kept looking up from the script I was working on to see more lumberjacks. </p> <p> At about 5.30pm that day, I left Stockholm on board the Silja Princess, a gargantuan passenger ferry, dwarfing any boat I had ever been on. It takes more than two hours to clear all the little inlets around Stockholm; they are, apparently, incredibly tricky waters to negotiate and the going is slow. This is one of the busiest strips of water anywhere in Europe; ships leave Stockholm at intervals of between 12 and 15 minutes, and I was told that 12 major ferries full of people arrive in Helsinki every day. </p> <p>The Finns, I discovered, are paranoid about drugs. They had no problem with traffickers until they joined the European Union, but now a lot of drugs are flowing into the country, and their Customs are ultra-strict. We ran into problems with them on the way back. The production team were stopped and searched, and a roll of film we had shot was opened by a suspicious officer. Exposed to the light, it was ruined. We lost a lot of shots that had captured the feel of the location. </p> <p>The ship was so comfortable I felt I could have stayed on her for days. The contents of my cabin's mini-bar were all free of charge. I won't go into the carnage that followed this discovery, but, suffice to say it was a quite hungover Scotsman who woke early next morning to witness the approach into Helsinki. I think my hangover helped to make this incredible experience all the more visceral. On the horizon, I could see another massive ferry, looking almost as though it had been painted onto some beautiful white canvas. </p> <p>As the alcohol drained out of my system in the freezing morning air, I was filled by a sheer joy to be alive and here, looking out at light glinting off the ice as we cut our path through it. Just hours earlier, smaller ice-breaker boats had been literally cutting through it, making a safe channel for our passage. In Scotland, I'm used to ponds freezing, but to think of the whole Baltic Sea becoming an icy mass was almost beyond my comprehension. It's quite incredible to be in a place where something so seemingly spectacular is the norm. In London, it only takes some heavy rain to bring everything to a grinding halt. Here I was in a part of the world where a foot of snow made no difference to public transport and a whole sea freezing was an everyday occurrence. </p> <p>The Silja Princess arrived in Helsinki on the Wednesday morning, almost exactly 48 hours after I'd left Tynron. It had been cold in Scotland when I said goodbye to my wife and kids, but that was nothing compared with the temperatures we experienced in Finland. I think the Scots and English have different psychological approaches when it comes to the cold. We have to deal with it so much more and, living out in the Dumfriesshire countryside, I'd say I was pretty hardened to it. </p> <p>I didn't suffer too much in Helsinki, but there was one night when I had to turn back from a planned walk, actually in pain from the sheer cold. I think the Finns and the Scots do have quite a bit in common; I even found that Helsinki reminded me of Glasgow in certain ways. The stone work and architectural design of many of the buildings are not dissimilar. I often think when I walk through Glasgow that the architecture at the back of buildings is even more interesting than that at the front. You've got to scout round, down the alleys, to see it. I found I was doing the same in Helsinki. </p> <p>The Finns, like the Scots, enjoy a drink. In fact, the Finnish people seem obsessed with alcohol. It's not only that they drink a lot of it, it also seems to be their main topic of conversation. The ships around Helsinki are full of Finns stocking up on duty-free booze. Some boats don't even land anywhere, they just leave Finnish waters, skirt around for a bit and return to discharge their cargoes of people clinging to trolleys packed full of vodka, wine and beer. </p> <p>I was viewed as something of a circus act by the people I met in Helsinki. I was the Scotsman who'd travelled all the way to their country by train because he didn't like flying. It wasn't long before I was lured into a good old Scots versus Finns drinking contest, though only once we'd finished filming, I have to state. Mika Karttunen, from the Finnish production crew, took me to a Helsinki nightclub just to get me completely wasted on as many different types of vodka as possible. I lost track of the types of drink that passed my lips that night: treacle-flavoured vodka, strawberry-flavoured vodka, orange-flavoured vodka, perhaps even vodka- flavoured vodka. I can't remember. What I do remember is Mika's father-in-law, a very dapper man who sported a monocle, smuggling out his own brogues to his son-in-law who, although otherwise equally immaculately dressed, was being refused entry because of his trainers. Another surreal moment from an incredible week. </p> <p>I was exhausted by the time I left Helsinki on the Friday night on the 2,000-mile journey back to London, where I would start editing the film we had shot. All this travelling felt quite in the spirit of the film, really. Anna, Vronsky, Levin, Kitty and company would have had to endure days of travel on trains between Moscow and St Petersburg, and I doubt they would have had a free mini bar to get them through it. Cheers. Here's to not flying.</p>",

We lost a lot of shots that had captured the feel of the location. The ship was so comfortable I felt I could have stayed on her for days. The contents of my cabin's mini-bar were all free of charge. I won't go into the carnage that followed this discovery, but, suffice to say it was a quite hungover Scotsman who woke early next morning to witness the approach into Helsinki. I think my hangover helped to make this incredible experience all the more visceral. On the horizon, I could see another massive ferry, looking almost as though it had been painted onto some beautiful white canvas. As the alcohol drained out of my system in the freezing morning air, I was filled by a sheer joy to be alive and here, looking out at light glinting off the ice as we cut our path through it. Just hours earlier, smaller ice-breaker boats had been literally cutting through it, making a safe channel for our passage. In Scotland, I'm used to ponds freezing, but to think of the whole Baltic Sea becoming an icy mass was almost beyond my comprehension. It's quite incredible to be in a place where something so seemingly spectacular is the norm. In London, it only takes some heavy rain to bring everything to a grinding halt. Here I was in a part of the world where a foot of snow made no difference to public transport and a whole sea freezing was an everyday occurrence. The Silja Princess arrived in Helsinki on the Wednesday morning, almost exactly 48 hours after I'd left Tynron. It had been cold in Scotland when I said goodbye to my wife and kids, but that was nothing compared with the temperatures we experienced in Finland. I think the Scots and English have different psychological approaches when it comes to the cold. We have to deal with it so much more and, living out in the Dumfriesshire countryside, I'd say I was pretty hardened to it. I didn't suffer too much in Helsinki, but there was one night when I had to turn back from a planned walk, actually in pain from the sheer cold. I think the Finns and the Scots do have quite a bit in common; I even found that Helsinki reminded me of Glasgow in certain ways. The stone work and architectural design of many of the buildings are not dissimilar. I often think when I walk through Glasgow that the architecture at the back of buildings is even more interesting than that at the front. You've got to scout round, down the alleys, to see it. I found I was doing the same in Helsinki. The Finns, like the Scots, enjoy a drink. In fact, the Finnish people seem obsessed with alcohol. It's not only that they drink a lot of it, it also seems to be their main topic of conversation. The ships around Helsinki are full of Finns stocking up on duty-free booze. Some boats don't even land anywhere, they just leave Finnish waters, skirt around for a bit and return to discharge their cargoes of people clinging to trolleys packed full of vodka, wine and beer. I was viewed as something of a circus act by the people I met in Helsinki. I was the Scotsman who'd travelled all the way to their country by train because he didn't like flying. It wasn't long before I was lured into a good old Scots versus Finns drinking contest, though only once we'd finished filming, I have to state. Mika Karttunen, from the Finnish production crew, took me to a Helsinki nightclub just to get me completely wasted on as many different types of vodka as possible. I lost track of the types of drink that passed my lips that night: treacle-flavoured vodka, strawberry-flavoured vodka, orange-flavoured vodka, perhaps even vodka- flavoured vodka. I can't remember. What I do remember is Mika's father-in-law, a very dapper man who sported a monocle, smuggling out his own brogues to his son-in-law who, although otherwise equally immaculately dressed, was being refused entry because of his trainers. Another surreal moment from an incredible week. I was exhausted by the time I left Helsinki on the Friday night on the 2,000-mile journey back to London, where I would start editing the film we had shot. All this travelling felt quite in the spirit of the film, really. Anna, Vronsky, Levin, Kitty and company would have had to endure days of travel on trains between Moscow and St Petersburg, and I doubt they would have had a free mini bar to get them through it. Cheers. Here's to not flying.",

      "body": "<p>The Rue de Berri is typical of the streets that radiate off the Arc de Triomphe end of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. There are a couple of smart hotels, a scattering of designer clothes stores and some small bar/brasseries. Inevitably, the street bears some of the scars of international branding: a Chicago Pizza Pie Factory stands across the street from a Firkin pub. But what could be more French than the turn-of-the-century mansion on the corner of the Rue d'Artois with its art nouveau styling? Look again, for this is the Paris Residence, part of a new wave of timeshare development that originated in Edinburgh. </p> <p>This is timeshare, but not as you know it. The Paris Residence is being converted into 33 self-contained suites supported by all the usual hotel facilities with a concierge and a 24-hour room service menu. It was the ideal venue for my outing last weekend with my three sons aged 19, 23 and 25. When I ran out of steam, I could retreat to my classic suite - a living space larger than the average hotel bedroom decorated in period style with high ceilings and large traditional windows with wrought-iron balconies - while they continued to play in their grand suite with its separate living room and a bathroom large enough to hold a party (which it probably did). </p> <p>We had billed this as our stag weekend (mine as it happens) but it was really a rite of passage, a chance to spend time together after five testing, but rewarding, years since their mother died. And where better to spend this time than in Paris? The Residence may have Edinburgh influences (and English was the lingua franca ) but we intended to celebrate in French style. When manager Kevin Gunn told us that the cheapest beer in Paris was to be found in the Bowler pub just around the corner, we smiled knowingly. This was not for us. Of course, after several beers in a streetside cafe and a Vietnamese meal we ended up in the Bowler, though I compromised by ordering a calvados. </p> <p>I was first to leave the Bowler in the early hours and wasn't surprised when the boys were slow to start on the Saturday morning. This turned to our advantage for after a late breakfast (or rather an early lunch) in a square opposite the Bourse we were able to walk straight into the Pompidou Centre (there were lengthy queues when we left in mid-afternoon). We were entertained by the post-1960 work on the fourth floor and engaged by the scale of the collection on the fifth (from 1905 to 1960) where there seemed to be a Picasso at every turn.</p> <p> Just as exciting were the views on every side of the city of light shimmering in the haze of a spring heatwave. The Sacr\u00e9 Coeur drew us like a magnet to Montmartre where the streets were crowded and the portrait painters were busy as usual making their subjects look years younger. A cut down a sidestreet to the M\u00e9tro at Pigalle led to an interesting encounter with a flamboyant transvestite: we fled back to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es where we stopped in a small bar for refreshment. We were the only customers, but the landlord secured a second round when he switched the television to show live coverage of Munster overcoming Toulouse in rugby's Heineken Cup semi-final. </p> <p>As we passed the Bowler on our way back to change for the evening, we realised it was just 4.45pm at home, that special moment of the week when the football results flood in. The televi sion was tuned to Gillette Soccer Saturday on Sky. The boys sat with their pints of Heineken watching the dramas unfold. Watford might be going down to the first division but they secured a draw at Middlesbrough. It gave them particular pleasure when Luton were pegged back by a 90th-minute equaliser. I watched them with a surge of affection knowing how this inherited ritual continues to puzzle any woman who has known us well. </p> <p>Now we switched to a full-bodied French flavour, with a little help from a friend - regular Escape writer John Brunton, who has the knack of finding those bars and restaurants locals prefer to keep to themselves. He recommended L'Ebauchoir, a bistro in the back streets of Aligre in the Bastille area, with tiled floors, wooden tables and an informal but electric atmosphere. We sat at an alcove table, underneath a vast, colourful mural. The menus, chalked on giant blackboards handed round the tables, were on the face of it traditional - carr\u00e9 d'agneau, jus aux thyme; confit de canard maison; veal and lots of fish. But the flavours were subtle with variations such as calves' liver with coriander and honey. </p> <p>There was a great buzz as extended families as well as the smart-but-casual set tucked into their food. The pleasures of the table seem always to be heightened in Paris. Even with an indulgent bottle of Gevrey Chambertin, the bill for three courses each came to just 874 francs (\u00a383). On Sunday morning we returned to the Bastille to follow up another recommendation by visiting the Marche D'Aligre, a jam-packed fruit, vegetable and flea-market. Crates were stacked outside the Baron Rouge bar to form tables where those in the know enjoyed glasses of wine from the barrel and plates of crevettes and cold meat. Our verdict was unanimous: 'John Brunton rocks.' </p> <p>Eurostar seemed to speed us too quickly away from Paris, yet the value of the train and tunnel combination is that the journey connects you with the changing landscapes of France and England in a real timescale: in fact, just what the weekend had done for our lives together. </p> <p>\u0095 A flexible week's timeshare for a classic suite at the Paris Residence costs from 97,250 francs (\u00a39,260) plus 8,898 francs (\u00a3850) in taxes and fees while a grand suite starts at 122,500 francs (\u00a311,670) plus 10,287 (\u00a3980). This buys seven nights a year for 20 years which can be taken outside new year, Easter and major sporting events.

      "bodyText": "The Rue de Berri is typical of the streets that radiate off the Arc de Triomphe end of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. There are a couple of smart hotels, a scattering of designer clothes stores and some small bar/brasseries. Inevitably, the street bears some of the scars of international branding: a Chicago Pizza Pie Factory stands across the street from a Firkin pub. But what could be more French than the turn-of-the-century mansion on the corner of the Rue d'Artois with its art nouveau styling? Look again, for this is the Paris Residence, part of a new wave of timeshare development that originated in Edinburgh. This is timeshare, but not as you know it. The Paris Residence is being converted into 33 self-contained suites supported by all the usual hotel facilities with a concierge and a 24-hour room service menu. It was the ideal venue for my outing last weekend with my three sons aged 19, 23 and 25. When I ran out of steam, I could retreat to my classic suite - a living space larger than the average hotel bedroom decorated in period style with high ceilings and large traditional windows with wrought-iron balconies - while they continued to play in their grand suite with its separate living room and a bathroom large enough to hold a party (which it probably did). We had billed this as our stag weekend (mine as it happens) but it was really a rite of passage, a chance to spend time together after five testing, but rewarding, years since their mother died. And where better to spend this time than in Paris? The Residence may have Edinburgh influences (and English was the lingua franca ) but we intended to celebrate in French style. When manager Kevin Gunn told us that the cheapest beer in Paris was to be found in the Bowler pub just around the corner, we smiled knowingly. This was not for us. Of course, after several beers in a streetside cafe and a Vietnamese meal we ended up in the Bowler, though I compromised by ordering a calvados. I was first to leave the Bowler in the early hours and wasn't surprised when the boys were slow to start on the Saturday morning. This turned to our advantage for after a late breakfast (or rather an early lunch) in a square opposite the Bourse we were able to walk straight into the Pompidou Centre (there were lengthy queues when we left in mid-afternoon). We were entertained by the post-1960 work on the fourth floor and engaged by the scale of the collection on the fifth (from 1905 to 1960) where there seemed to be a Picasso at every turn. Just as exciting were the views on every side of the city of light shimmering in the haze of a spring heatwave. The Sacr\u00e9 Coeur drew us like a magnet to Montmartre where the streets were crowded and the portrait painters were busy as usual making their subjects look years younger. A cut down a sidestreet to the M\u00e9tro at Pigalle led to an interesting encounter with a flamboyant transvestite: we fled back to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es where we stopped in a small bar for refreshment. We were the only customers, but the landlord secured a second round when he switched the television to show live coverage of Munster overcoming Toulouse in rugby's Heineken Cup semi-final. As we passed the Bowler on our way back to change for the evening, we realised it was just 4.45pm at home, that special moment of the week when the football results flood in. The televi sion was tuned to Gillette Soccer Saturday on Sky. The boys sat with their pints of Heineken watching the dramas unfold. Watford might be going down to the first division but they secured a draw at Middlesbrough. It gave them particular pleasure when Luton were pegged back by a 90th-minute equaliser. I watched them with a surge of affection knowing how this inherited ritual continues to puzzle any woman who has known us well. Now we switched to a full-bodied French flavour, with a little help from a friend - regular Escape writer John Brunton, who has the knack of finding those bars and restaurants locals prefer to keep to themselves. He recommended L'Ebauchoir, a bistro in the back streets of Aligre in the Bastille area, with tiled floors, wooden tables and an informal but electric atmosphere. We sat at an alcove table, underneath a vast, colourful mural. The menus, chalked on giant blackboards handed round the tables, were on the face of it traditional - carr\u00e9 d'agneau, jus aux thyme; confit de canard maison; veal and lots of fish. But the flavours were subtle with variations such as calves' liver with coriander and honey. There was a great buzz as extended families as well as the smart-but-casual set tucked into their food. The pleasures of the table seem always to be heightened in Paris. Even with an indulgent bottle of Gevrey Chambertin, the bill for three courses each came to just 874 francs (\u00a383). On Sunday morning we returned to the Bastille to follow up another recommendation by visiting the Marche D'Aligre, a jam-packed fruit, vegetable and flea-market. Crates were stacked outside the Baron Rouge bar to form tables where those in the know enjoyed glasses of wine from the barrel and plates of crevettes and cold meat. Our verdict was unanimous: 'John Brunton rocks.' Eurostar seemed to speed us too quickly away from Paris, yet the value of the train and tunnel combination is that the journey connects you with the changing landscapes of France and England in a real timescale: in fact, just what the weekend had done for our lives together. \u0095 A flexible week's timeshare for a classic suite at the Paris Residence costs from 97,250 francs (\u00a39,260) plus 8,898 francs (\u00a3850) in taxes and fees while a grand suite starts at 122,500 francs (\u00a311,670) plus 10,287 (\u00a3980). This buys seven nights a year for 20 years which can be taken outside new year, Easter and major sporting events. There is an annual maintenance fee of 2,950 francs (\u00a3280 ) for a classic suite and 3,450 francs (\u00a3330) for a grand suite.

      "body": "<p>Britain is a nation that for centuries has dispatched its violently inclined citizens to do their dirty work abroad, in the colonies or, more recently, in Hollywood. Ridley Scott, one of our most gifted directors of commercials and a most impressive exponent of screen violence, has yet to make a movie set in this country. </p> <p>No one could accuse him of being squeamish and his directorial debut in 1977, The Duellists, featured a succession of brutally painful sabre fights between two French officers in the Napoleonic Wars. The extraterrestrial monster leaping from John Hurt's stomach in Alien is among the most shocking moments in movie history, and now in Gladiator, Scott's best film since Thelma and Louise, he's revived the bloodiest of action genres. </p> <p>Roman history was the chief topic of the Italian epics before the First World War, while Mussolini encouraged another wave of such pictures in the Thirties to celebrate his own imperial ambitions. Meanwhile, Hollywood got in on the act with the silent Ben-Hur of 1924. </p> <p>The need to meet the challenge of TV with spectacular entertainments and bigger screens brought about a revival of the costume epic in the Fifties, with new film versions of the Victorian novels Quo Vadis? and Ben-Hur, and pictures based on more recent books such as The Robe and Barabbas, many shot at what became known as Hollywood-on-the-Tiber. </p> <p>They usually contrasted Roman decadence with Christian spirituality, though for all their piety the selling point was brutal combat in the arena rather than prayers in the catacombs. </p> <p>In April 1964, the month Anthony Mann's The Fall of the Roman Empire premiered in London, there also opened with less fanfare five dubbed Italian epics of the sort known in Italy as 'peplums' (named for the short tunics the heroes wore) and elsewhere as sword and sandal sagas, among them Caesar the Conqueror, Battles of the Gladiators and Gladiators Seven. </p> <p>But the glut of such movies and the catastrophic box-office failure of the prestigious, all-star Fall of the Roman Empire brought the cycle to a sudden end. Since then, Christians have been thrown to the lions and Roman legionnaires have marched into battle only for laughs, as in the Asterix comedies and Monty Python's Life of Brian. </p> <p>So here's Ridley Scott in deadly earnest bringing us the most ferocious picture of its kind since Richard Fleischer's Barabbas. But there is no reference to Christianity in Gladiator. It's about the undoing and attempted restoration of civilised values and covers the very events treated in The Fall of the Roman Empire - the death of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 180, his failed attempt to appoint a worthy successor and the disastrous 13-year rule of his corrupt son, Commodus, from which point Gibbon charts the imperial decline. </p> <p>Like Scott, Anthony Mann was a great visual stylist and a master of screen violence. But in The Fall of the Roman Empire, he tried to be too tasteful: before the first blood is shed, there's 45 stately minutes of fancy dialogue between the emperor and his Greek counsellor and beautifully composed shots of a spectacular gathering of regional leaders. </p> <p>Scott doesn't make this mistake. His picture starts with the Roman army on a muddy battlefield near the Danube, straining like greyhounds in the slips to be unleashed on the howling barbarian hordes by their heroic Spanish-born general, Maximus (Russell Crowe). 'What we do in life echoes in eternity,' he tells his troops, establishing the film's principal theme of confronting death and destiny. </p> <p>Suddenly, flaming arrows fly through the air, catapults unleash balls of fire that explode above the enemy. The centurions advance accompanied by the cavalry and a hand-to-hand battle ensues, with Maximus in the vanguard. The rapid editing gives way to slow motion and an elegiac soundtrack. This is a final costly victory for tired, tested men and a knock-out overture. </p> <p>When the battle is over, the effete Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arrives in a Roman equivalent of a movie star's trailer. 'Have I missed the battle?' he asks his father. 'You have missed the war,' says Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris, who has an uncanny resemblance to Alec Guinness in Mann's picture). </p> <p>The functional dialogue is pared down and rarely lapses into old-fashioned Hollywood historic or high-flown Christopher Fry poetic. Marcus wants Maximus, a fictitious character, to succeed him and make Rome a republic again. But Commodus kills his ailing father, sentences Maximus to death for treason and becomes Caesar. </p> <p>From then on, the film pits the decent, civic warrior against the libertine villain, the man who, in Gibbon's words, had 'an aversion to whatever was rational or liberal, and a fond attachment to the amusements of the populace: the sports of the circus and amphitheatre, the combats of gladiators and the hunting of wild beasts'. </p> <p>After turning the tables on his executioners, Maximus embarks on a long voyage home that is like a cross between the travels of Ulysses after the fall of Troy and the travails of Spartacus as slave and enforced gladiator. It is a journey of revenge that brings him from the dusty eastern fringes of the empire back to a Rome corrupted by Commodus. </p> <p>The movie is at once gloomy and exciting, oppressive and exhilarating, though at times the plot is somewhat puzzling. Its Rome is as grand as that of past movies, but a harder, harsher place, and the succession of battles in the arena are electrifyingly staged, imaginatively varied and increasingly ferocious. Enthralling and appalling, the gladiatorial combat appeals to much that is primitive and atavistic in us, but we experience it through a true hero who has lost everything except his dignity and his will to survive. </p> <p>There are attractive performances from Oliver Reed (as an ex-gladiator turned arena impresario), Derek Jacobi (happily back in a toga as an honest senator 25 years after I Claudius) and the statuesque Djimon Hounsou as the hero's resigned African friend. </p> <p>But the movie is dominated by Russell Crowe's towering Maximus, a man of intelligence, probity and Roman virtue. He's the most virile presence in a film of this kind since Richard Burton commanded the widescreen in The Robe, in 1953. Following on from L.A. Confidential and The Insider, Crowe confirms his position as one of the best star character actors around. </p> <p>When I read that Ridley Scott's next subject was to be Hannibal I naturally supposed that he was going to celebrate Rome's most formidable enemy, whose defeat is bloodily restaged at the Colosseum in Gladiator like an ancient version of a video game. The hero of his next film, however, is Hannibal Lecter, who'd feel very much at home as Commodus's dinner guest.</p>",

'It was a dream part but afterwards I got offered lots of girls with guns.' Until recently, though, she wasn't offered many Irish roles. She was obviously eager to play Nora, a rare big screen female Irish protagonist, but enjoys employing an English accent. 'I'm always more comfortable doing different accents,' she explains. 'It makes you feel slightly different and it adds to the character.' </p> <p>She did play the Irish love interest in last year's surprise hit Waking Ned, a role which raised her international profile, following a series of supporting roles in TV dramas such as Ivanhoe and Amongst Women.

      "bodyText": "I borrowed \u00a310,000 from Lombard North Central in May 1995 at a variable rate of 1.31 per cent a month for about five years. Last December, I was given a settlement figure of \u00a32,629. I reckoned this should have been \u00a31,642. A detailed statement showed that the rate applied was 1.47 per cent a month, and indicated that one payment by cheque, in 1996, was not included. I want to settle this account quickly, since each month costs me an extra \u00a320 in interest using my figures, or \u00a340 using theirs. GS, Accrington Lombard North Central, now First National Tricity Finance, is owned by Abbey National, which has checked the figures again and agrees that you are right. At the outset, someone typed in the wrong interest rate so, instead of 1.31 per cent a month (an annual percentage rate of 16.9 per cent) you have been charged 1.47 per cent, or 18.8 per cent a year for five years. During that time, the interest rate changed only once - to go up to 20.9 per cent. But instead of raising your repayments, the lender extended the term, which is why you still owe money after making 60 monthly payments. So instead of insisting that you owe \u00a31,756, Abbey agrees it should be \u00a3756.

      "body": "<p>How ironic that Bill Gates, the person most associated with the personal computer, should reportedly have had his credit card details stolen by a teenage hacker. If it can happen to the world's greatest geek, what hope for the rest of us? </p> <p>And the havoc created by the Love Bug virus provides a further reminder of the fallibility of electronic information systems. </p> <p>Chris Potter, who works for PriceWaterhouse Cooper advising organisations on how to secure e-business, says that where Gates and the US go, Britain is sure to follow. </p> <p>And with UK levels of Internet crime 12 to 18 months behind those in the US, he says: 'All the drivers are towards increasing cyber-crime.' </p> <p>The US-based Computer Security Institute's latest survey shows that the threat from computer crime is continuing unabated, with 35 per cent of respondents reporting between two and five attacks on their e-commerce sites in the past 12 months. </p> <p>And in January, shock waves reverberated around the computer world when CD Universe, an e-commerce retailer, admitted that customers' credit card data could have been compromised, after a 19-year-old Russian hacker 'Maxim' posted 25,000 stolen card numbers on the Web. </p> <p>Potter says he hears a couple of stories a month about breaches of Internet security in the UK, some involving household names. </p> <p>One is BT, whose security was breached in April when a few smart alecs found they could access customers' names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. </p> <p>A BT spokesman said the problem was caused by human error, and less than 1,000 customers had been affected. </p> <p>BT is not the only UK company to give its customers cause for concern. The Halifax suspended online share-dealing in November after customers found they could access other people's personal details. And last May, there was a security scare at the Internet bank, Egg. </p> <p>So if the security of some of the UK's best known and largest companies has been compromised, shouldn't we be concerned? </p> <p>Potter admits that there is no such thing as 100 per cent security. And given that fewer than half of US organisations surveyed would report computer crime even if required to do so by law, Potter says: 'What you see is only the tip of the iceberg.' But he adds that by following sensible precautions, the risks can be greatly reduced. </p> <p>It is important to know who you are dealing with, he says. 'When I shop on the Internet, I am careful where I buy and who I buy from.' </p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading warns people to check the company's geographical and website addresses. This will stop details being pirated by those who have set up websites with names similar to well known companies'. </p> <p>'You have some extra protection if you buy with a credit card,' says the OFT. This applies particularly when an item costs more than \u00a3100, even if you only pay a deposit: you can claim against the card company should there be a breach of contract with the retailer. </p> <p>The OFT advises customers to, 'look for traders with an encryption facility to scramble card details'. However, not all encryption offers the same security. Potter says the minimum encryption necessary for transferring confidential information is Secure Socket Layer, which brings up a padlock symbol on the screen. 'But even this is not a universal panacea,' he warns. </p> <p>In the laboratory, he says, it has been possible to intercept data on the Internet, siphon it off and break the encryption code. To counter this possibility, people should take account of the sort of items they are buying when judging whether encryption is sufficient. For low-value items, he says, a little encryption is 'better than none'. For more expensive transactions, he says, people should look for the highest possible level. </p> <p>The OFT says: 'Check whether the company has a privacy statement giving details of its information handling practices. This will indicate the uses they make of the information about you, and says something about the security they apply to this information.' </p> <p>Helena Sims of the Data Protection Registry, adds that since the 1998 Data Protection Act came into force in March, organisations have 'a requirement to keep secure information they collect on individuals'. </p> <p>Her office receives complaints from people unhappy that their details have been made available to others. Most concern smaller retailers and pure e-commerce businesses, and are caused by companies, 'storing personal information on the website rather than elsewhere'. </p> <p>And as with cyber-crime, it's a problem that looks set to grow. But no matter how sophisticated the security systems, Potter says that, as with the breaking of the Enigma encryption machine during the Second World War, 'it is the human element which is often the weakest link'.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How ironic that Bill Gates, the person most associated with the personal computer, should reportedly have had his credit card details stolen by a teenage hacker. If it can happen to the world's greatest geek, what hope for the rest of us? And the havoc created by the Love Bug virus provides a further reminder of the fallibility of electronic information systems. Chris Potter, who works for PriceWaterhouse Cooper advising organisations on how to secure e-business, says that where Gates and the US go, Britain is sure to follow. And with UK levels of Internet crime 12 to 18 months behind those in the US, he says: 'All the drivers are towards increasing cyber-crime.' The US-based Computer Security Institute's latest survey shows that the threat from computer crime is continuing unabated, with 35 per cent of respondents reporting between two and five attacks on their e-commerce sites in the past 12 months. And in January, shock waves reverberated around the computer world when CD Universe, an e-commerce retailer, admitted that customers' credit card data could have been compromised, after a 19-year-old Russian hacker 'Maxim' posted 25,000 stolen card numbers on the Web. Potter says he hears a couple of stories a month about breaches of Internet security in the UK, some involving household names. One is BT, whose security was breached in April when a few smart alecs found they could access customers' names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. A BT spokesman said the problem was caused by human error, and less than 1,000 customers had been affected. BT is not the only UK company to give its customers cause for concern. The Halifax suspended online share-dealing in November after customers found they could access other people's personal details. And last May, there was a security scare at the Internet bank, Egg. So if the security of some of the UK's best known and largest companies has been compromised, shouldn't we be concerned? Potter admits that there is no such thing as 100 per cent security. And given that fewer than half of US organisations surveyed would report computer crime even if required to do so by law, Potter says: 'What you see is only the tip of the iceberg.' But he adds that by following sensible precautions, the risks can be greatly reduced. It is important to know who you are dealing with, he says. 'When I shop on the Internet, I am careful where I buy and who I buy from.' The Office of Fair Trading warns people to check the company's geographical and website addresses. This will stop details being pirated by those who have set up websites with names similar to well known companies'. 'You have some extra protection if you buy with a credit card,' says the OFT. This applies particularly when an item costs more than \u00a3100, even if you only pay a deposit: you can claim against the card company should there be a breach of contract with the retailer. The OFT advises customers to, 'look for traders with an encryption facility to scramble card details'. However, not all encryption offers the same security. Potter says the minimum encryption necessary for transferring confidential information is Secure Socket Layer, which brings up a padlock symbol on the screen. 'But even this is not a universal panacea,' he warns. In the laboratory, he says, it has been possible to intercept data on the Internet, siphon it off and break the encryption code. To counter this possibility, people should take account of the sort of items they are buying when judging whether encryption is sufficient. For low-value items, he says, a little encryption is 'better than none'. For more expensive transactions, he says, people should look for the highest possible level. The OFT says: 'Check whether the company has a privacy statement giving details of its information handling practices. This will indicate the uses they make of the information about you, and says something about the security they apply to this information.' Helena Sims of the Data Protection Registry, adds that since the 1998 Data Protection Act came into force in March, organisations have 'a requirement to keep secure information they collect on individuals'. Her office receives complaints from people unhappy that their details have been made available to others. Most concern smaller retailers and pure e-commerce businesses, and are caused by companies, 'storing personal information on the website rather than elsewhere'. And as with cyber-crime, it's a problem that looks set to grow. But no matter how sophisticated the security systems, Potter says that, as with the breaking of the Enigma encryption machine during the Second World War, 'it is the human element which is often the weakest link'.",

Solicitors and estate agents involved in a pilot scheme report that the pack is expensive to produce and unlikely to reduce the period between acceptance of an offer and completion. </p> <p>The pack aims to speed up house sales and reduce gazumping (sellers accepting a higher bid after agreeing a lower one) and gazundering (the buyer offering a lower-than-agreed price just before exchange). The pack - to be prepared by a seller's solicitor before the property is put on the market - includes all the information a buyer needs to make an informed decision. Once the buyer's solicitor has approved the information, contracts can be exchanged without all the delays normally caused by searches, surveys and solicitors' correspondence. </p> <p>So far 179 homesellers have agreed to take part in the pilot, which has been running in Bristol since January. Of these, 60 have received offers on their properties, 31 have exchanged and 11 have reached completion. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which is running the pilot, claims that early results indicate that the pack has helped to accelerate property sales, enabling a 'smooth, seamless, stress-free process, where problems are known about earlier, helping buyers and sellers to agree a realistic final selling price'. </p> <p>However, several estate agents and solicitors involved in the scheme are not impressed. Robert Pain of estate agent Allen &amp; Harris says he has found it diffi cult to persuade sellers to take part. 'Increasing numbers of people like to look for a property before they put theirs on the market, and if they've found one they like, they want to start selling theirs straight away, not wait up to two weeks while a pack is put together.' </p> <p>He is concerned that the time-savings experienced during the pilot will not be achieved once the scheme becomes mandatory. The DETR reports that one seller in the pilot scheme took just 12 days to complete on his property after accepting an offer, and even the longest transaction has taken 47 days, comparing well with the average 56 days for a normal sale. But Pain points out that these results are due largely to the fact that Bristol City Council had earmarked pilot scheme local searches for special attention, pushing them through in 48 hours. Searches for normal sales take up to four weeks. </p> <p>Mike Rendell of solicitor Convey Direct adds: 'Ninety per cent of cases involve chains, and here the seller's pack is irrelevant. No one can complete until everyone in the chain is ready.' </p> <p>He questions the cost of producing a pack. The DETR quotes an approximate cost of \u00a3450, but Rendell says it is more likely to cost between \u00a3600 and \u00a3700. This cost could increase if a property takes a long time to sell, as local searches expire after three months and the seller would have to renew them. </p> <p>The survey, which costs about \u00a3350, is the most interesting part of the pack for the buyer. However, the survey does not include the valuation required by all lenders, so buyers requiring a mortgage will still have to pay for one (about \u00a3150). Currently only 20 per cent of buyers order a homebuyer's report - the equivalent of the survey in the seller's pack. The rest rely on their lender's valuation report, a more superficial survey. </p> <p>However, not all involved with the pilot are critical. Anna Maggs of estate agent Maggs &amp; Allen says the pack has speeded up sales: 'It's fabulous for us because as soon as we start marketing, we've got everything we need to go ahead with a sale.' </p> <p>Even Rendell admits the pack has cut the need for time-consuming correspon dence between buyer's and seller's solicitors, but he adds: 'If it's a good thing to be transparent, the seller's pack achieves that. But if you are saying this is going to prevent gazumping, that's absolute rubbish.'</p>",

The DETR quotes an approximate cost of \u00a3450, but Rendell says it is more likely to cost between \u00a3600 and \u00a3700. This cost could increase if a property takes a long time to sell, as local searches expire after three months and the seller would have to renew them. The survey, which costs about \u00a3350, is the most interesting part of the pack for the buyer. However, the survey does not include the valuation required by all lenders, so buyers requiring a mortgage will still have to pay for one (about \u00a3150). Currently only 20 per cent of buyers order a homebuyer's report - the equivalent of the survey in the seller's pack. The rest rely on their lender's valuation report, a more superficial survey. However, not all involved with the pilot are critical. Anna Maggs of estate agent Maggs &amp; Allen says the pack has speeded up sales: 'It's fabulous for us because as soon as we start marketing, we've got everything we need to go ahead with a sale.' Even Rendell admits the pack has cut the need for time-consuming correspon dence between buyer's and seller's solicitors, but he adds: 'If it's a good thing to be transparent, the seller's pack achieves that. But if you are saying this is going to prevent gazumping, that's absolute rubbish.'",

      "body": "<p>British Energy, like many of our traditional companies, likes to complain that its shares have suffered from investors' love affair with the new economy. But last week's results from the nuclear power company showed just why investors should be so desperate to buy into high-growth companies. </p> <p>It is not just that British Energy's profits and earnings fell by 19 and 15 per cent respectively. It is not even the 50 per cent cut in the dividend, although income is about the only thing many old economy companies have going for them. It is what that cut tells investors about how British Energy sees its future. And if it believes its business can only afford to pay out half what it used to, the prospects look bleak. </p> <p>British Energy's key problem is that it has no control over the price of electricity - it just takes the price set by the arcane arrangements of the pool pricing mechanism. And this has collapsed: the average price achieved in the year to March fell by 7 per cent, but the fall in the fourth quarter was even more severe. </p> <p>The looming review of the pricing mechanism - NETA, or New Electricity Trading Arrangements - makes it impossible to predict whether, let alone when, that will recover. Few customers are prepared to sign contracts beyond the expected review date in the autumn, and those that have been signed are at around 15 per cent below the current pool price. </p> <p>British Energy was also hit by problems: these caused the shutdown of two of its key power stations, Dungeness and Heysham. That cut its output by 9 per cent and reduced its utilisation to a meagre 74 per cent, compared with a theoretical maximum of 85 per cent-plus. Dungeness is now back in operation and Heysham will be completely operational by the autumn. But its profits will still be suffering from the shutdowns in the current year. </p> <p>A cut in capacity is particularly serious for a nuclear generator, as most of its costs are fixed and have to be paid whether the plants are operating or not. It is doing its best with the variable costs: slicing them by 7 per cent last year and promising further cuts this year. But the 19 per cent fall in profit before tax, to \u00a3241m for the year to March, shows just how little British Energy can control the impact of the electricity market on its figures. That is underlined by the warning from Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Williams de Broe, that the result this year could range from a profit of \u00a3350m to a loss of \u00a360m. The first figure is based on similar prices and output to last year's; the second on a 15 per cent fall in prices and a 9 per cent fall in output. The directors will presumably have done similar calculations before they decided to slash the dividend. </p> <p>Investors are right not to rate British Energy as a technology stock. Estimates such as those from Hawkins suggest it is far riskier than the average dot.com. Until there is more clarity over pool prices, the shares should be avoided. </p> <p><strong> High price of success</strong><br> It seems investors are prepared to pay any price to get into the few retail companies with decent growth prospects. Matalan and N Brown both produced excellent results last week, but the share prices of both have now gone beyond realistic levels. </p> <p>Matalan's progress continues to astonish. Like-for-like sales rose 21 per cent in the year to 26 February, and since then growth has accelerated to 31 per cent. Combined with the contribution from new store openings, profits have soared from \u00a322.7m to \u00a354.1m, although the latter figure was for 60 weeks rather than 53. </p> <p>With large swathes of the country still to get the Matalan experience, the group has plenty of scope for growth by opening new stores. It is also toying with the idea of using the information gathered from its database of customers - who have to pay \u00a31 in exchange for membership - to sell other products, such as financial services. There must be a question as to why it needs to do this when it is enjoying such excellent growth from its core retail business, but at least it does not seem to be distracting management's attention from the key challenge of getting the retail offer right. </p> <p>N Brown also ran true to form, increasing both profits and sales by around 10 per cent in the year to February: a notable achievement when all other retailers are struggling. </p> <p>It has been doing that for years, yet its shares never enjoyed the rating they deserved. What has excited investors now is Zendor.com, its newly launched e-fulfilment business (which, translated, means that it is selling its expertise in warehousing, delivery, credit checking and other logistics to Internet retailers). That is an interesting service: N Brown has already signed up four customers. But it is too early to judge how successful Internet retailing will be, let alone who will profit from running it. </p> <p>N Brown's shares trade on a multiple of about 23 times its expected earnings for the current year, while Matalan is priced at a stratospheric 35 times forecast profits. That leaves little room for growth, and plenty of risk of disappointments. Nice companies, shame about the share price. </p> <p><strong> Still worth banking on</strong><br> There is something about the Internet that encourages even the most focused of companies to believe they can sell anything. Even LloydsTSB, justly famous for its early realisation that high street banks should stick to their core business, suddenly thinks it can also be travel agent, theatre booking agency and restaurant critic. </p> <p>Its <a href=\"http://www.evolve.com\" target=\"_new\">evolve.com</a> Internet banking service offers all this, tailored to its customers' wishes. And this, it thinks, should help it net a quarter of those who chose to bank solely on the Web by 2003. </p> <p>Fortunately, it also believes that only a minority will want to bank solely on the Internet, and is devoting most of its energies to keeping customers who want to use both hi-tech and conventional services. Here its plans look sensible, albeit no different to those of any of its rivals. And it must still be odds-on that those of us who are banking on the Internet in 10 years time will largely be doing so through the websites of the existing high street banks. </p> <p>The market, however, remains concerned that its Internet investment - \u00a3150m this year and further unspecified figures thereafter - is stepping up just as competition from the Web is pushing margins on the rest of the business lower. That is justified. But the collapse in its shares - they have fallen by 40 per cent since last year's peak - discounts too much bad news. The patient investor should tuck them away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British Energy, like many of our traditional companies, likes to complain that its shares have suffered from investors' love affair with the new economy. But last week's results from the nuclear power company showed just why investors should be so desperate to buy into high-growth companies. It is not just that British Energy's profits and earnings fell by 19 and 15 per cent respectively. It is not even the 50 per cent cut in the dividend, although income is about the only thing many old economy companies have going for them. It is what that cut tells investors about how British Energy sees its future. And if it believes its business can only afford to pay out half what it used to, the prospects look bleak. British Energy's key problem is that it has no control over the price of electricity - it just takes the price set by the arcane arrangements of the pool pricing mechanism. And this has collapsed: the average price achieved in the year to March fell by 7 per cent, but the fall in the fourth quarter was even more severe. The looming review of the pricing mechanism - NETA, or New Electricity Trading Arrangements - makes it impossible to predict whether, let alone when, that will recover. Few customers are prepared to sign contracts beyond the expected review date in the autumn, and those that have been signed are at around 15 per cent below the current pool price. British Energy was also hit by problems: these caused the shutdown of two of its key power stations, Dungeness and Heysham. That cut its output by 9 per cent and reduced its utilisation to a meagre 74 per cent, compared with a theoretical maximum of 85 per cent-plus. Dungeness is now back in operation and Heysham will be completely operational by the autumn. But its profits will still be suffering from the shutdowns in the current year. A cut in capacity is particularly serious for a nuclear generator, as most of its costs are fixed and have to be paid whether the plants are operating or not. It is doing its best with the variable costs: slicing them by 7 per cent last year and promising further cuts this year. But the 19 per cent fall in profit before tax, to \u00a3241m for the year to March, shows just how little British Energy can control the impact of the electricity market on its figures. That is underlined by the warning from Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Williams de Broe, that the result this year could range from a profit of \u00a3350m to a loss of \u00a360m. The first figure is based on similar prices and output to last year's; the second on a 15 per cent fall in prices and a 9 per cent fall in output. The directors will presumably have done similar calculations before they decided to slash the dividend. Investors are right not to rate British Energy as a technology stock. Estimates such as those from Hawkins suggest it is far riskier than the average dot.com. Until there is more clarity over pool prices, the shares should be avoided. High price of success It seems investors are prepared to pay any price to get into the few retail companies with decent growth prospects. Matalan and N Brown both produced excellent results last week, but the share prices of both have now gone beyond realistic levels. Matalan's progress continues to astonish. Like-for-like sales rose 21 per cent in the year to 26 February, and since then growth has accelerated to 31 per cent. Combined with the contribution from new store openings, profits have soared from \u00a322.7m to \u00a354.1m, although the latter figure was for 60 weeks rather than 53. With large swathes of the country still to get the Matalan experience, the group has plenty of scope for growth by opening new stores. It is also toying with the idea of using the information gathered from its database of customers - who have to pay \u00a31 in exchange for membership - to sell other products, such as financial services. There must be a question as to why it needs to do this when it is enjoying such excellent growth from its core retail business, but at least it does not seem to be distracting management's attention from the key challenge of getting the retail offer right. N Brown also ran true to form, increasing both profits and sales by around 10 per cent in the year to February: a notable achievement when all other retailers are struggling. It has been doing that for years, yet its shares never enjoyed the rating they deserved. What has excited investors now is Zendor.com, its newly launched e-fulfilment business (which, translated, means that it is selling its expertise in warehousing, delivery, credit checking and other logistics to Internet retailers). That is an interesting service: N Brown has already signed up four customers. But it is too early to judge how successful Internet retailing will be, let alone who will profit from running it. N Brown's shares trade on a multiple of about 23 times its expected earnings for the current year, while Matalan is priced at a stratospheric 35 times forecast profits. That leaves little room for growth, and plenty of risk of disappointments. Nice companies, shame about the share price. Still worth banking on There is something about the Internet that encourages even the most focused of companies to believe they can sell anything. Even LloydsTSB, justly famous for its early realisation that high street banks should stick to their core business, suddenly thinks it can also be travel agent, theatre booking agency and restaurant critic. Its evolve.com Internet banking service offers all this, tailored to its customers' wishes. And this, it thinks, should help it net a quarter of those who chose to bank solely on the Web by 2003. Fortunately, it also believes that only a minority will want to bank solely on the Internet, and is devoting most of its energies to keeping customers who want to use both hi-tech and conventional services. Here its plans look sensible, albeit no different to those of any of its rivals. And it must still be odds-on that those of us who are banking on the Internet in 10 years time will largely be doing so through the websites of the existing high street banks. The market, however, remains concerned that its Internet investment - \u00a3150m this year and further unspecified figures thereafter - is stepping up just as competition from the Web is pushing margins on the rest of the business lower. That is justified. But the collapse in its shares - they have fallen by 40 per cent since last year's peak - discounts too much bad news. The patient investor should tuck them away.",

Like his father and grandfather before him, he buries his townspeople, perhaps a couple of hundred a year. He lays them out on the slab, washes them, dresses them, folds their hands on their breasts, stitches up their anuses, closes their eyes. He puts them under the ground with rituals. He comforts the living. </p> <p>For him, the word 'undertaking' has great resonance. As a child, he imagined the word literally - a taking under (though why not underputting? he wondered). As he grew older, he realised that undertaking was for the living: 'An undertaker was someone who stood with the living confronted with death and pledged to do whatever could be done with it.' </p> <p>Then finally, undertaking became not something done for the living but something done by them: 'Undertakings,' he writes in an earlier collection, The Undertaking, 'are the things we do to vest the lives we lead against the cold, the meaningless, the void, the noisome blather and blinding dark. It is the voice we give to pain, to love and desire. Anger and courage, the words we shape into song and prayer.' </p> <p>It is, says Lynch, a pledge and a promise. Reading such words, it no longer seems surprising that an undertaker should be a poet, for Lynch the poet is an undertaker all along. </p> <p>In his final essay of this new collection, he makes the same lyrical connections between the words he writes and the trade he practises. Though many view an undertaker/poet like they would a cop who sings opera or a wrestler turned governor (and because it makes good copy, he charges accordingly, 'like a dancing bear'), here, he says, is the 'quiet, little truth of the matter. Requiems and prosodies, sonnets and obsequies, poems and funerals - they are all the same... an effort at meaning and metaphor, an exercise in symbol and ritualised speech, the heightened acoustics of language raised against what is reckoned unspeakable - faith and heartbreak, desire and pain, love and grief'. </p> <p>Or as his hero Seamus Heaney says more succinctly, less self-indulgently: 'Poetry is what we do to break bread with the dead.' </p> <p>Thomas Lynch is a romantic, in love with the sound of the words that he makes; besotted with the comparisons between poetry and funerals, the undertakings of life and the undertakings of death, between sex and death. </p> <p>He remembers the first poem he ever heard; the first body he ever saw; the first woman he kissed. He was once an alcoholic, he tells us, and there is in this collection, soaked in reminiscence and that 'heightened acoustic of language', a sense of addiction to sorrow, melancholy, joy, to the nostalgic tales of fateful sexual encounters, and to the sense of himself as an undertaker/poet, lying awake at night while the woman he loves sleeps beside him, and the rain falls on the window, and maybe a candle flickers, and he a sleepless man, half his hard, mistake-laden life behind him, brimful of misty verse. </p> <p>In The Undertaking, the essays were linked and they were all about the practicalities and metaphysics of his trade, and, as such, they were, if a bit early-Yeatsian in their romantic intensity, somehow irresistible in their unflinching details. Most of us fear death. We peek at death through our fingers, like children; we have to look and we can't. 'I'm not scared of dying,' said Woody Allen. 'I just don't want to be there when it happens.' </p> <p>But Lynch is there for us, giving us details of what a dead body looks like, feels like, what it smells like, how the flesh congeals, how the relatives weep or turn away from bodies that may be, he says in this new book, 'skinny with Aids, green with liver failure, or bulbous with renal failure... and who'd want to see someone they love like this? Whatever way they got like this. Dead.' The unimaginable becomes commonplace. He sees death for us, reports back from a front line we haven't reached yet, but know we will. </p> <p>By this collection, however, the subject has been mostly exhausted. Lynch has already written out his obvious subject, and in its place ruminates on all manner of other subjects: the womb, abortion, his ex-wife's bad behaviour, Bible studies, soft porn, fatherhood, his loathed cat, fishing, standing on the seashore, making packed lunches, the way he wrote a particular poem, other poets, his children. </p> <p>Which is fine, but not what we want from him. We want the post mortem on mystery. His method is freewheeling and associative, letting words and metaphors ratchet him round to unexpected connections, usually coming back at the end to a contemplation of death. </p> <p>But the most successful pieces in the book are still about his trade. He writes about Jessica Mitford, author of The American Way of Death, whom Lynch, though a friend of hers, accuses of focusing on costs and mechanics so she wouldn't have to think about what death actually means. </p> <p>Indeed, Lynch fastens on to the word 'cost' throughout the book. 'Do the maths' is one of his favourite phrases, as is 'difficult maths' - adding up the sums for the casket, the funeral, the burial; adding up the costs of a life; getting and spending. </p> <p>He writes about his son becoming a fully-blown, down-in-the-gutter alcoholic at a horribly early age, (a condition passed down from father to son, burying sorrows in the bottle; seeking oblivion, finding early heaven and hell in whisky and rum). He writes about undertaking chains and the quick-fix burial (Funerals-R-Us, he calls them, or McFunerals). </p> <p>Best of all, he writes about caskets, and the whole way of selling a burial and marketing a death.

The Vatican says it predicted the attempt on his life in 1981.</p> <p>Once the Pope had beatified Jacinta and Francisco Martos before an ecstatic congregation of perhaps half a million worshippers, his Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, revealed that the third part of the Virgin's message included a vision of the 1981 attack on the Pope by Mehmet Ali Agca. It had been concealed by the Vatican for more than 50 years.</p> <p>The text, which contains a prophetic vision was written by Sister Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, the third witness to the apparitions and the only survivor.</p> <p>'According to the interpretation of the \"little shepherds\", which was also recently confirmed by Sister Lucia, the \"bishop clothed in white\" who prays for all the faithful is the Pope,' Cardinal Sodano said to applause from the congregation.</p> <p>'As he makes his way with great effort towards the Cross amid the corpses of those who were martyred (bishops, priests, men and women religious and many lay persons) he too falls to the ground, apparently dead, under a burst of gunfire.'</p> <p>This revelation helps to explain the Pope's conviction that Our Lady of Fatima saved his life in an attack that took place on the 65th anniversary of the first apparition at Fatima. The Pope believed that 'a motherly hand which guided the bullet's path' delivered him 'from the threshold of death' the cardinal continued.</p> <p>Asked why the Vatican had not increased protection around the pontiff because of the message, Joaqu\u00edn Navarro-Valls, the papal spokesman, replied: 'It was only known by the Pope, not by the police.'</p> <p>This underlines why the pontiff was so determined to visit Fatima, ignoring the advice of officials, who feared that the pilgrimage would prove too much a strain for the Pope after his gruelling and high-profile trips this year to Israel, Egypt and Jordan.</p> <p>'He was quite insistent', said a Vatican source. 'Once he had made up his mind there was no stopping him.'</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from across the globe gathered yesterday at the Catholic shrine for the beatification, and many had wondered if the pontiff might reveal the 'third secret' - which had been widely feared to contain an apocalyptic vision. Those gathered in the huge precinct leading to the basilica cheered, wept and tossed rose petals into the papal path as John Paul arrived in his white 'Popemobile', flanked by security men.</p> <p>In animated form for such a ceremony he feels to be deeply personal, the Pope waved to the crowd and smiled, before entering the basilica for a private meeting with Sister Lucia, close to the marble tombs of her celebrated young cousins, now Blessed Jacinta and Blessed Francisco Martos. Setting a precedent for the Church, which has never before beatified children who have not died as martyrs, the Pope proclaimed Blessed Jacinta and Blessed Francisco as new role models for Christian youth.</p> <p>Packed worshippers cried out 'Long live the Pope' and cheered as the Portuguese and Vatican flags were pulled down from the basilica's fa\u00e7ade to reveal photographs of the children, their expressions solemn, even anxious.</p> <p>The Pope is well-known for his devotion to the Virgin Mary. It is, says Gerard O'Connell of the Tablet, a leading Catholic journal, 'the thing that goes back to his childhood, it's the constant thread of his own spirituality'. Shortly after his arrival on Friday evening to applause from more than 150,000 people in the congregation, many of whom were preparing to camp out overnight to ensure a good spot for yesterday's Mass, the Pope offered his ring to Our Lady of Fatima, placing it at the foot of a statue whose crown bears the bullet that wounded him in 1981.</p> <p>Jacinta was only seven at the time of the apparitions, but died two years later, shortly after her elder brother, Francisco.</p> <p>According to the story told by Sister Lucia's memoirs, the three children saw the Virgin appear six times during 1917, as they pastured sheep in a hollow on the family's farm. 'We beheld a Lady, all dressed in white. She was more brilliant than the sun,' the nun wrote. The vision appeared six times and promised to perform a miracle 'for all to see and believe'. She urged the children to make sacrifices for God, and told Jacinta and Francisco they would soon leave for Heaven, and Lucia would stay on Earth for longer.</p> <p>On 13 October, a crowd of 70,000 joined the children and reported seeing the sun, harmless to the naked eye, spin on its axis and zigzag across the sky. The children had decided not to reveal the Virgin's words, but Lucia, persuaded by the Church, agreed to publish the first two 'secrets' of Fatima.</p> <p>These include a vision of hell 'which horrified us and made us tremble with fear', the end of the First World War and the prediction of a second, as well as a call for the conversion of Russia.</p> <p>In Sister Lucia's account, the Virgin concluded, 'in Portugal, the dogma of the faith will always be preserved... Do not tell this to anybody.' This referred to the remaining secret of Fatima, revealed by Sister Lucia only to the five Popes who have reigned in her time.</p> <p>'I've been expecting it, because I think with this Pope it's the time for it,' said one English pilgrim who gave her name as Ann, and said that she visits Fatima every year.</p> <p>'I was expecting him to reveal it today, he's obviously so close to dying. He's the one to bring us all to the consciousness of what Christianity is all about, to go back to the originals.' The Pope has ordered the Vatican to prepare for publication the full text with 'appropriate commentary', the cardinal said, warning that the vision was not of 'photographic clarity' but must be interpreted 'in a symbolic key'.</p> <p>'The vision of Fatima concerns above all the war waged by atheist systems against the Church and Christians, and it describes the immense suffering endured by the witnesses to the faith in the last century of the second millennium,' the cardinal added.</p> <p>It is a message that must have resonated strongly with a Pope so famous for his anti-communist crusade.</p> <p><b>How a prophecy became history</b></p> <p><b> 1917 </b> At Fatima the Virgin appears to Jacinta Marto, her brother, Francisco, and their cousin, Lucia dos Santos, on the 13th day of each month from May to October and reveals three secrets, including a vision of hell and the outbreak of the Second World War.</p> <p><b> 1941</b> Sister Lucia dos Santos, the only survivor of the child visionaries, begins writing her memoirs but will not reveal the last part, the 'Third Secret of Fatima'.</p> <p><b> 1981</b> A former Trappist monk hijacks an Aer Lingus plane, threatening to blow it up unless the Third Secret is revealed.</p> <p>In Rome, Pope John Paul II is shot and almost killed by Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk.

'According to the interpretation of the \"little shepherds\", which was also recently confirmed by Sister Lucia, the \"bishop clothed in white\" who prays for all the faithful is the Pope,' Cardinal Sodano said to applause from the congregation. 'As he makes his way with great effort towards the Cross amid the corpses of those who were martyred (bishops, priests, men and women religious and many lay persons) he too falls to the ground, apparently dead, under a burst of gunfire.' This revelation helps to explain the Pope's conviction that Our Lady of Fatima saved his life in an attack that took place on the 65th anniversary of the first apparition at Fatima. The Pope believed that 'a motherly hand which guided the bullet's path' delivered him 'from the threshold of death' the cardinal continued. Asked why the Vatican had not increased protection around the pontiff because of the message, Joaqu\u00edn Navarro-Valls, the papal spokesman, replied: 'It was only known by the Pope, not by the police.' This underlines why the pontiff was so determined to visit Fatima, ignoring the advice of officials, who feared that the pilgrimage would prove too much a strain for the Pope after his gruelling and high-profile trips this year to Israel, Egypt and Jordan. 'He was quite insistent', said a Vatican source. 'Once he had made up his mind there was no stopping him.' Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from across the globe gathered yesterday at the Catholic shrine for the beatification, and many had wondered if the pontiff might reveal the 'third secret' - which had been widely feared to contain an apocalyptic vision. Those gathered in the huge precinct leading to the basilica cheered, wept and tossed rose petals into the papal path as John Paul arrived in his white 'Popemobile', flanked by security men. In animated form for such a ceremony he feels to be deeply personal, the Pope waved to the crowd and smiled, before entering the basilica for a private meeting with Sister Lucia, close to the marble tombs of her celebrated young cousins, now Blessed Jacinta and Blessed Francisco Martos. Setting a precedent for the Church, which has never before beatified children who have not died as martyrs, the Pope proclaimed Blessed Jacinta and Blessed Francisco as new role models for Christian youth. Packed worshippers cried out 'Long live the Pope' and cheered as the Portuguese and Vatican flags were pulled down from the basilica's fa\u00e7ade to reveal photographs of the children, their expressions solemn, even anxious. The Pope is well-known for his devotion to the Virgin Mary. It is, says Gerard O'Connell of the Tablet, a leading Catholic journal, 'the thing that goes back to his childhood, it's the constant thread of his own spirituality'. Shortly after his arrival on Friday evening to applause from more than 150,000 people in the congregation, many of whom were preparing to camp out overnight to ensure a good spot for yesterday's Mass, the Pope offered his ring to Our Lady of Fatima, placing it at the foot of a statue whose crown bears the bullet that wounded him in 1981. Jacinta was only seven at the time of the apparitions, but died two years later, shortly after her elder brother, Francisco. According to the story told by Sister Lucia's memoirs, the three children saw the Virgin appear six times during 1917, as they pastured sheep in a hollow on the family's farm. 'We beheld a Lady, all dressed in white. She was more brilliant than the sun,' the nun wrote. The vision appeared six times and promised to perform a miracle 'for all to see and believe'. She urged the children to make sacrifices for God, and told Jacinta and Francisco they would soon leave for Heaven, and Lucia would stay on Earth for longer. On 13 October, a crowd of 70,000 joined the children and reported seeing the sun, harmless to the naked eye, spin on its axis and zigzag across the sky. The children had decided not to reveal the Virgin's words, but Lucia, persuaded by the Church, agreed to publish the first two 'secrets' of Fatima. These include a vision of hell 'which horrified us and made us tremble with fear', the end of the First World War and the prediction of a second, as well as a call for the conversion of Russia. In Sister Lucia's account, the Virgin concluded, 'in Portugal, the dogma of the faith will always be preserved... Do not tell this to anybody.' This referred to the remaining secret of Fatima, revealed by Sister Lucia only to the five Popes who have reigned in her time. 'I've been expecting it, because I think with this Pope it's the time for it,' said one English pilgrim who gave her name as Ann, and said that she visits Fatima every year. 'I was expecting him to reveal it today, he's obviously so close to dying. He's the one to bring us all to the consciousness of what Christianity is all about, to go back to the originals.' The Pope has ordered the Vatican to prepare for publication the full text with 'appropriate commentary', the cardinal said, warning that the vision was not of 'photographic clarity' but must be interpreted 'in a symbolic key'. 'The vision of Fatima concerns above all the war waged by atheist systems against the Church and Christians, and it describes the immense suffering endured by the witnesses to the faith in the last century of the second millennium,' the cardinal added. It is a message that must have resonated strongly with a Pope so famous for his anti-communist crusade. How a prophecy became history 1917 At Fatima the Virgin appears to Jacinta Marto, her brother, Francisco, and their cousin, Lucia dos Santos, on the 13th day of each month from May to October and reveals three secrets, including a vision of hell and the outbreak of the Second World War. 1941 Sister Lucia dos Santos, the only survivor of the child visionaries, begins writing her memoirs but will not reveal the last part, the 'Third Secret of Fatima'. 1981 A former Trappist monk hijacks an Aer Lingus plane, threatening to blow it up unless the Third Secret is revealed. In Rome, Pope John Paul II is shot and almost killed by Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk. The Pope believes the Madonna of Fatima saved his life. He has the bullet welded into the crown of the Virgin in Fatima.",

      "body": "<p>Leafing through a magazine one afternoon, I found myself looking at the letters page. One of the letters caught my attention. It was from a woman whose husband had lost his job because of the Tokyo gas attack. A subway commuter, he had been unfortunate enough to be on his way to work in one of the carriages in which the sarin gas was released. He passed out and was taken to hospital. But even after several days' recuperation, the after-effects lingered on, and he couldn't get himself back into the working routine. At first, he was tolerated, but as time went on his boss and colleagues began to make snide remarks. Unable to bear the atmosphere any longer, he resigned.</p> <p>The letter shocked me. Here were people who still carried serious psychological scars. As if it weren't enough to be the victim of purely random violence, the man had suffered 'secondary victimisation' (everyday corporate violence of the most pervasive kind). Why could nobody do anything about it? I grew curious to learn more and decided to interview the survivors of the attack.</p> <p>The degree of suffering inflicted by the sarin attack varied considerably from person to person. Some escaped with little actual harm, those less fortunate died or are still undergoing therapy for serious health problems. I had a hunch that we needed to see a true picture of all the survivors, severely traumatised or not, in order to better grasp the whole incident. But first you must imagine...</p> <p>The date is Monday 20 March, 1995. It is a beautiful clear spring morning. You get up at the normal time, wash, dress, breakfast, and head for the subway station. You board the train, crowded as usual. Nothing out of the ordinary. It promises to be a perfectly run-of-the-mill day. Until five men in disguise poke at the floor of the carriage with the sharpened tips of their umbrellas, puncturing some plastic bags filled with a strange liquid...</p> <p><b> Kiyoka Izumi (26)</b></p> <p><b> Works in the PR department of a foreign airline company </b></p> <p>I never get ill, but on the morning of 20 March I wasn't feeling well. I caught the train to work anyway. I stood at the front next to the driver's compartment, holding the handrail. Then, when I took a deep breath, I got this sudden pain. It was like I'd been shot or something, all of a sudden my breathing completely stopped. I'd never felt so bad. It was that intense.</p> <p>When the train got to my stop I began to feel really sick. So instead of going straight out, I thought I'd better go to the toilet first. As I was passing the stationmaster's office, I saw three station attendants just lying there. I was at a loss. What was going on? When I came out of the station 10 minutes later they had been brought up and were laid on the ground, spoons stuck in their mouths as a precaution against them choking on their tongues. About six other station staff sat there on the flower beds holding their heads and crying. I didn't have a clue what was happening. I thought they were grieving for their colleagues.</p> <p>TV Tokyo cameramen were filming the whole scene. I ran after the film crew, saying: 'Now's not the time for that! If you've got transport, take these people to the hospital!' The driver conferred with his crew and said, 'All right, fine.'</p> <p>We managed to lift Mr Takahashi, the station attendant who later died, into the back, along with another assistant. The driver pleaded with me, 'Miss, you come along with us', but there were still lots of others being brought above ground and someone had to look after them, so I stayed behind. There was a girl nearby, crying and trembling. I tried to comfort her until the ambulance came. One man was foaming at the mouth. I had no idea humans could foam like that.</p> <p>When I got to the office, my boss had seen me on TV, and everyone was asking 'Ms Izumi, are you really okay?'After a while a message came from Personnel: 'If you start to feel ill report to hospital immediately.' So they put me in an ambulance. I had this terrible asthmatic cough, and a high fever of over 40 C [104 F]. I was completely immobilised. As I lay there, the television showed Mr Takahashi lying dead with a spoon in his mouth. I couldn't bear to watch it.</p> <p><b> Minoru Miyata (54)</b></p> <p><b>Chauffeur for TV Tokyo</b></p> <p>When we got to the station everybody was screaming their heads off. Ikida, the cameraman was shooting the whole scene. That's when somebody spoke up: 'How about instead of filming us, you help take one or two people to hospital?' So me and the crew talk it over. 'What the hell are we going to do?' 'It'll look bad if we don't take them.'</p> <p>In the car we had assistant stationmaster Takahashi, who died, and another guy, not as bad. We ran all the red lights; went the wrong way down one-way streets. We were desperate; I knew it was life-or-death.</p> <p>When we got to the hospital they couldn't cope. It was 9.30, over an hour since the gas attack. And yet the hospital didn't know what had happened. That night I learned Takahashi had died, which made me so sad. To think that someone you'd transported didn't make it.</p> <p><b> Toshiaki Toyoda (52)</b></p> <p><b>Station attendant</b></p> <p>I was on monitor duty that day for the Chiyoda Line, and two colleagues died while I was responsible. Two men who ate in the same canteen as me. To tell the truth, I'd rather not remember it... That day at about 7.40am, I handed over to Okazawa saying: 'Everything's in order.' Pretty soon, though, Okazawa came by, picked up the intercom and said: 'There was an explosion or something at Tsukiji Station, so they've stopped the train.'</p> <p>Next came a phone call from Central Office: 'Suspicious item sighted on board. Please verify.' When I got to Train A725K I noticed there were spots all over the platform, almost like paraffin or something. And around the base of a pillar were seven or eight big wads of newspaper. Takahashi was on the platform - he'd been trying to mop up the stuff.</p> <p>I crouched down, picked up the bundles of newspaper up and put them in a plastic bag that Okazawa held open for me. We carried the bags back to the office staffroom. Takahashi stayed on the platform cleaning. I was trembling all over by then. I tried to check the train timetable, but couldn't read the numbers. Just then word came in that Takahashi had collapsed on the platform. I was in no shape to go and help. I tried to call in to Head Office, but my voice wouldn't come. All the time those bundles of sarin-soaked newspapers were right there at my feet.</p> <p>I went to wash my face. Nose running, eyes watering, not a pretty sight. Have to make myself a bit more presentable, I thought. I stripped off my jacket and washed my face at the sink. I always take off my uniform when I wash so as not to get it wet. Sheer habit. Only later did I find out that this was a good thing, because it was soaked with sarin. Same goes for washing my face.</p> <p>Just then I started foaming at the mouth. I went faint and collapsed. After that I don't remember a thing.</p> <p>It was 11 the next morning before I came to, and found out Takahashi and Hishinuma, another colleague, had died. That night I couldn't get to sleep. I'd been spared. After that came the anger. I was irritable, irrational, got upset at everything. It was clearly some sort of hyper-excited condition. I feel a lot more relaxed now, but this rage sometimes flares up over nothing. I have no physical symptoms, but psychologically there's this burden. I've got to get rid of it somehow.</p> <p><b> Mitsuteru Izutsu (38)</b></p> <p><b>Shrimp import buyer for a major trading house</b></p> <p>I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until I got off the train. A lot of people coughing, but that was all. I just went to the office. The TV is always on so we can keep up with the exchange rates. When I saw the news report I didn't think for a moment it was the train I'd taken, but slowly I started to feel ill. Everyone said I should go to hospital.</p> <p>There were a few other sarin victims there and they'd set up a production line to test blood pressure and the like. They still didn't have any antidote, but I was put on a drip for an hour and a half, then I was told to go home and come back tomorrow. They didn't do any tests at all.</p> <p>The next day was a holiday, so I just lay down and rested. Everything still seemed dark, and I had no energy. Couldn't sleep much at night. I was scared that if I went to sleep I might never wake up again.</p> <p>I live alone now, but at the time I had a family. A wife and kids. The day after the gas attack, I asked my wife for a divorce. We hadn't been on the best of terms for quite a while. Still, even after all I'd been through, she would barely speak to me. I phoned home from the office to tell her what had happened, but I got almost no reaction from her. Perhaps she couldn't really grasp the situation. But even so, well... I knew then that we'd come to a turning point. I came straight out with it and said I wanted a divorce.</p> <p>Perhaps if this sarin thing hadn't happened, I wouldn't have said anything. It was a shock to the system and at the same time a kind of trigger.</p> <p><b> Kenji Ohashi(41)</b></p> <p><b> Car dealer married with three children</b></p> <p>As soon as I got on the train, I noticed two people in odd postures behind me. A man hunched over in his seat, nearly falling off, and a huddled woman, head down and sort of curled up. And then there was this really strange smell. At first I thought there must be some drunk who's thrown up making the place stink.</p> <p>But I got a seat, so I was prepared to put up with a little smell. I soon fell asleep, so when I suddenly heard the announcement 'This station is Nakano-sakaue', I snapped awake, jumped up and left the train.</p> <p>Everything was dim. The lights on the platform were faint. My throat was parched and I was coughing. I went to the water-cooler and gargled. My nose was running and my legs were shaky. I sat down. My lungs were wheezing like I was running a marathon. I was afraid if I lost consciousness I'd be done for.</p> <p>I was taken by police van to Nakano General Hospital. They put me on an IV straight away but we were still wearing our sarin-saturated clothes. Soon the hospital staff were complaining of eye trouble, too.</p> <p>I was in hospital for 12 days: vicious headaches the whole time. No pain-killer worked. I was in agony. The headaches would come in waves all day. They finally discharged me on 31 March and I took a month off work to recuperate at home. First thing in the morning my head would hurt. It was like a killer hangover.</p> <p>I took off all of April, then after the early May holidays I started back on the job. I know I overdid it. Every day it felt like I had some massive weight crushing my skull. One day in August it took me three hours to get to work. I had to stop off all along the route and rest until the pain subsided.</p> <p>I went to see a psychologist at St Luke's Hospital and he said I had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Since then I've been relieved of my managerial responsibilities and only work 8.30am to 3pm. I feel very isolated. I still have headaches all day.</p> <p>There have been times I've contemplated suicide. I almost think I'd be better off dead. If I'd lost an arm, or was reduced to a vegetable, people could probably sympathise more. If only I'd died then, how much easier it would have been. But when I think of my family, I have to go on...</p> <p><b> Tatsuo Akashi (37)</b></p> <p><b> Elder brother of critically injured 'Shizuko Akashi' who was reduced to a vegetative condition by the attack and remains in hospital.</b></p> <p>I had taken the company car to see a client, when a call came in from the office. I was to contact my mother urgently. 'We had a call from the police,' she said. 'Shizuko was injured in the subway and taken to hospital. Go quickly!'</p> <p>I reached the hospital around noon. The reception was filled with victims. All of them were on drips or getting examined. The doctors weren't much help. All they told me that day was: 'She inhaled a virulent chemical similar to a pesticide.'</p> <p>I waited for two hours and then got to see her just briefly. She was dressed in a hospital gown and lying in bed getting artificial dialysis. She was on several drips. Her eyes were closed. According to the nurse she was in a 'sleeping state'. I reached out to touch her but the doctor held me back; I wasn't wearing gloves.</p> <p>She'd been having convulsions since they brought her in. Her face, to be crude, looked more dead than asleep. She had an oxygen mask over her mouth, and she was expressionless. The device that measured her heartbeat hardly flickered, just an occasional blip. I could hardly bear to look at her.</p> <p>That evening our parents, my wife and kids all came to the hospital. The kids were too small to understand the situation, but seeing them let me get some feelings out. 'Something horrible's happened to Auntie Shizuko ...' I started crying. My kids were upset; they'd never seen me cry before. They tried to comfort me, 'Daddy, Daddy, don't cry!' - and then we were all crying.</p> <p>A few days later, we were shown an X-ray of her head and were told: 'The brain's swollen.' They said there was virtually no chance of further recovery. In other words, while she wasn't a 'vegetable', she would probably remain bedridden for the rest of her life. Unable to sit up, unable to speak, barely aware of anything.</p> <p>Since then, she's had therapy and progressed to the point where she can move her right hand. It's still not easy for her to speak, but she seems to understand most of what we're saying. This year she's been able to laugh. I'll say, 'Who farted?' and she'll answer 'Brother' but whether or not she knows what a 'brother' is is another matter. Most of her memory has disappeared.</p> <p>I go the hospital every other day. It's 11pm by the time I get home. Sundays the whole family goes. My wife's the one I feel sorry for: if she hadn't married me, she wouldn't have to put up with all this. And the kids, too.</p> <p>The night before the attack, the family was saying over dinner 'My, how lucky we are. All together, having a good time' ... a modest share of happiness. Destroyed the very next day by those idiots. They stole what little joy we had.</p> <p>(Tatsuo Akashi is not his real name.)</p> <p><b> Hiroshige Sugazaki (58)</b></p> <p><b> Insurance executive</b></p> <p>As soon as the train door opened that morning I turned right and got a seat. I looked up to see this man sitting directly to my left wearing a leather coat. 'This guy stinks,' I thought and I stared him right in the eye. He just stared back at me with this 'You-got-a-problem, mister?' look.</p> <p>Then I saw something about the size of a notebook lying at the feet of the second person on my right. A plastic pack with something spilling out of it. Soon there's nobody left at the back of the carriage. Everyone's moved to the front, saying, 'It stinks! It stinks!'</p> <p>By then my head was spinning. I thought to myself 'I really must be anaemic today.' I decided to get off and rest for a while, maybe let two or three trains go by. But when I tried to stand I couldn't get up. My legs had gone. I grabbed the handstrap and sort of dangled from it.</p> <p>I moved from strap to strap until I reached the pole near the door. I grabbed it and just slid down to the floor. They ran a photo of me in the tabloids, so I could see later what happened. I was seen on television, too, lying like that on the carriage floor. I was flat out for at least half an hour. Then the station attendants carried me away.</p> <p>I came to in hospital three days later. I had no awareness of time passing at all. No awareness is paradise.</p> <p>Around that time one of my daughters was pregnant. I'd been anxious about it. It would be my first grandchild. Well, apparently my sister-in-law came in and said to me: 'What if you never see your grandchild's face?' Until then I'd shown absolutely no reaction to anything anyone had said, but this I heard and suddenly regained consciousness. My grandson was born in September, and thanks to him I came back to life.</p> <p>I probably shouldn't say this, but all the nurses were beautiful! I even said so to my wife. For some time after I came around, I was convinced everyone in the world had turned beautiful on me [laughs].</p> <p>I found nights at the hospital frightening, though. Lying in bed, I'd brush up against the frame of the bed and I'd feel like a cold, damp hand was about to drag me into the darkness. I was sure there was a dead person in the ward whispering 'Come with me! This way, this way...'</p> <p>Back at home it was the same thing. Whenever I stepped on to a tatami mat, whenever I touched anything cold, those fears resurfaced. Even when I took a bath I couldn't do it alone, I was too scared. My wife had to scrub my back. 'Stay with me until I get out,' I told her. 'I don't want to be the last to leave' [laughs].</p> <p>Some of the victims are afraid to take the subway, even now. I was scared at first, too. I went back to work on 10 May, and from that very first day I took the exact same 7.15 Hibiya Line train that had been targeted in the gas attack. I even made sure I sat in the same carriage - the same seat. At that moment I felt a bit queasy, but having got it over and done with, my spirits lifted. That wiped the slate clean.</p> <p><b> Yoshiko Wada (31)</b></p> <p><b> Widow of Eiji Wada. She was pregnant when her husband died. A daughter, Asuka, was born not long afterwards.</b></p> <p>I met my husband skiing. This was in February, 1991. We saw each other a lot after that. Every week, and if possible at weekends, too. It really seemed we were made for each other. Like it was fate or something. We were married in June the following year.</p> <p>We hardly ever quarrelled. I was irritable while I was pregnant. I'd get at him for the most trivial things but he just took it all in his stride. He was such a kind person. He seemed to get even kinder before he died. If he got home from work and the cooking had gone wrong he'd just say, 'It's all right, I'll get a take-away.' And when I had morning sickness and could only eat sandwiches and grapefruit jelly, he'd always buy them for me on the way home from work.</p> <p>The day before 20 March we went shopping together. Something he'd ordinarily never do. We went to buy baby clothes and nappies, stuff like that. The next morning he said to me, 'If anything ever happens to me, you know you have to hang on in there and fight.' It was as though he had some kind of premonition.</p> <p>He left the house around 7.30. I pottered about a bit before settling down to watch the Morning Wide Show. Across the TV screen they ran subtitles - 'Such-and-such happened at Tsukiji Station' - but I didn't worry because I thought he commuted by the Marunouchi Line. At 9.30 a call came from the company saying, 'He seems to have got mixed up in this mess. We'll call back later.' Then 10 minutes later, it was, 'He's been taken to Nakajima Hospital. We'll fax you the details so you can get in touch directly.' So I rang them up, but they were in total confusion. 'We can't even keep track of who's here,' they said, and hung up. So all I could do was be patient and wait.</p> <p>It was just before 10 when the call came: 'It looks pretty bad, come to the hospital as quickly as possible.' I was getting ready to leave when they rang again with the message: 'He just died.'</p> <p>I took a taxi to the hospital but by the time I got there the body had been transferred to the central police station in Nihonbashi. I took another taxi. The driver had the news on and they were reading out the names of the deceased. I heard my husband's name. I thought, 'I can't be sure until I see his face. I won't cry until I know for sure' ... I just hoped against hope.</p> <p>They were examining the body, so it was 1.30 before I got to see him in the morgue. They'd laid him out completely naked and covered with a white sheet. 'Don't touch him,' they told me. 'Don't go too near.' If I touched him the sarin would penetrate my skin. But I'd already touched him. He was still warm. There were bloodied bite marks on his lips. Scabs, as if he'd bitten down really hard. And on his ears and nose, too, crusted, where he'd bled. His eyes were shut. I couldn't stay very long because it was 'dangerous'. I was in there less than a minute. 'Why did he have to die?' I said. 'Why did he leave me here?' And I broke down.</p> <p>The body was transferred to Tokyo University Medical Department where, the next day, I bid him a final farewell. They didn't let me touch him then either, nor my mother-in-law. We could only look. I couldn't believe they'd left him overnight in such a lonely place.</p> <p>The only good thing now is Asuka. Some little gesture, some food she likes will remind me of him. I'm always telling Asuka, 'Dada was like this.' When Asuka asks, 'Where's Dada?' I point to the photo on the altar and say, 'Dada, Dada.' She says 'Nighty-night' to the photo before going to sleep. It makes me want to cry.</p> <p>I'm thinking of teaching Asuka to ski. My husband always said he would. I'll wear my husband's gear and teach her. We wore the same size. I think I'll start next season. It's what he would have wanted.</p> <p><b>The Aum Shinrikyo Cult</b></p> <p>The trial of the Aum Shinrikyo cult members accused of the subway attack began nearly four years ago, after their sarin gas factory was discovered outside Tokyo. One received a death sentence last year and three have been sentenced to indefinite hard labour. The other six, including part-blind guru Shoko Asahara are still in court. The cult continues to thrive. It now has about 2,000 members and earned \u00a330 million last year from its shops selling cut-price computers.</p> <p>\u0095 This is an extract from Underground by Haruki Murukami (Harvill \u00a320).

A subway commuter, he had been unfortunate enough to be on his way to work in one of the carriages in which the sarin gas was released. He passed out and was taken to hospital. But even after several days' recuperation, the after-effects lingered on, and he couldn't get himself back into the working routine. At first, he was tolerated, but as time went on his boss and colleagues began to make snide remarks. Unable to bear the atmosphere any longer, he resigned. The letter shocked me. Here were people who still carried serious psychological scars. As if it weren't enough to be the victim of purely random violence, the man had suffered 'secondary victimisation' (everyday corporate violence of the most pervasive kind). Why could nobody do anything about it? I grew curious to learn more and decided to interview the survivors of the attack. The degree of suffering inflicted by the sarin attack varied considerably from person to person. Some escaped with little actual harm, those less fortunate died or are still undergoing therapy for serious health problems. I had a hunch that we needed to see a true picture of all the survivors, severely traumatised or not, in order to better grasp the whole incident. But first you must imagine... The date is Monday 20 March, 1995. It is a beautiful clear spring morning. You get up at the normal time, wash, dress, breakfast, and head for the subway station. You board the train, crowded as usual. Nothing out of the ordinary. It promises to be a perfectly run-of-the-mill day. Until five men in disguise poke at the floor of the carriage with the sharpened tips of their umbrellas, puncturing some plastic bags filled with a strange liquid... Kiyoka Izumi (26) Works in the PR department of a foreign airline company I never get ill, but on the morning of 20 March I wasn't feeling well. I caught the train to work anyway. I stood at the front next to the driver's compartment, holding the handrail. Then, when I took a deep breath, I got this sudden pain. It was like I'd been shot or something, all of a sudden my breathing completely stopped. I'd never felt so bad. It was that intense. When the train got to my stop I began to feel really sick. So instead of going straight out, I thought I'd better go to the toilet first. As I was passing the stationmaster's office, I saw three station attendants just lying there. I was at a loss. What was going on? When I came out of the station 10 minutes later they had been brought up and were laid on the ground, spoons stuck in their mouths as a precaution against them choking on their tongues. About six other station staff sat there on the flower beds holding their heads and crying. I didn't have a clue what was happening. I thought they were grieving for their colleagues. TV Tokyo cameramen were filming the whole scene. I ran after the film crew, saying: 'Now's not the time for that! If you've got transport, take these people to the hospital!' The driver conferred with his crew and said, 'All right, fine.' We managed to lift Mr Takahashi, the station attendant who later died, into the back, along with another assistant. The driver pleaded with me, 'Miss, you come along with us', but there were still lots of others being brought above ground and someone had to look after them, so I stayed behind. There was a girl nearby, crying and trembling. I tried to comfort her until the ambulance came. One man was foaming at the mouth. I had no idea humans could foam like that. When I got to the office, my boss had seen me on TV, and everyone was asking 'Ms Izumi, are you really okay?'After a while a message came from Personnel: 'If you start to feel ill report to hospital immediately.' So they put me in an ambulance. I had this terrible asthmatic cough, and a high fever of over 40 C [104 F]. I was completely immobilised. As I lay there, the television showed Mr Takahashi lying dead with a spoon in his mouth. I couldn't bear to watch it. Minoru Miyata (54) Chauffeur for TV Tokyo When we got to the station everybody was screaming their heads off. Ikida, the cameraman was shooting the whole scene. That's when somebody spoke up: 'How about instead of filming us, you help take one or two people to hospital?' So me and the crew talk it over. 'What the hell are we going to do?' 'It'll look bad if we don't take them.' In the car we had assistant stationmaster Takahashi, who died, and another guy, not as bad. We ran all the red lights; went the wrong way down one-way streets. We were desperate; I knew it was life-or-death. When we got to the hospital they couldn't cope. It was 9.30, over an hour since the gas attack. And yet the hospital didn't know what had happened. That night I learned Takahashi had died, which made me so sad. To think that someone you'd transported didn't make it. Toshiaki Toyoda (52) Station attendant I was on monitor duty that day for the Chiyoda Line, and two colleagues died while I was responsible. Two men who ate in the same canteen as me. To tell the truth, I'd rather not remember it... That day at about 7.40am, I handed over to Okazawa saying: 'Everything's in order.' Pretty soon, though, Okazawa came by, picked up the intercom and said: 'There was an explosion or something at Tsukiji Station, so they've stopped the train.' Next came a phone call from Central Office: 'Suspicious item sighted on board. Please verify.' When I got to Train A725K I noticed there were spots all over the platform, almost like paraffin or something. And around the base of a pillar were seven or eight big wads of newspaper. Takahashi was on the platform - he'd been trying to mop up the stuff. I crouched down, picked up the bundles of newspaper up and put them in a plastic bag that Okazawa held open for me. We carried the bags back to the office staffroom. Takahashi stayed on the platform cleaning. I was trembling all over by then. I tried to check the train timetable, but couldn't read the numbers. Just then word came in that Takahashi had collapsed on the platform. I was in no shape to go and help. I tried to call in to Head Office, but my voice wouldn't come. All the time those bundles of sarin-soaked newspapers were right there at my feet. I went to wash my face. Nose running, eyes watering, not a pretty sight. Have to make myself a bit more presentable, I thought. I stripped off my jacket and washed my face at the sink. I always take off my uniform when I wash so as not to get it wet. Sheer habit. Only later did I find out that this was a good thing, because it was soaked with sarin. Same goes for washing my face. Just then I started foaming at the mouth. I went faint and collapsed. After that I don't remember a thing. It was 11 the next morning before I came to, and found out Takahashi and Hishinuma, another colleague, had died. That night I couldn't get to sleep. I'd been spared. After that came the anger. I was irritable, irrational, got upset at everything. It was clearly some sort of hyper-excited condition. I feel a lot more relaxed now, but this rage sometimes flares up over nothing. I have no physical symptoms, but psychologically there's this burden. I've got to get rid of it somehow. Mitsuteru Izutsu (38) Shrimp import buyer for a major trading house I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until I got off the train. A lot of people coughing, but that was all. I just went to the office. The TV is always on so we can keep up with the exchange rates. When I saw the news report I didn't think for a moment it was the train I'd taken, but slowly I started to feel ill. Everyone said I should go to hospital. There were a few other sarin victims there and they'd set up a production line to test blood pressure and the like. They still didn't have any antidote, but I was put on a drip for an hour and a half, then I was told to go home and come back tomorrow. They didn't do any tests at all. The next day was a holiday, so I just lay down and rested. Everything still seemed dark, and I had no energy. Couldn't sleep much at night. I was scared that if I went to sleep I might never wake up again. I live alone now, but at the time I had a family. A wife and kids. The day after the gas attack, I asked my wife for a divorce. We hadn't been on the best of terms for quite a while. Still, even after all I'd been through, she would barely speak to me. I phoned home from the office to tell her what had happened, but I got almost no reaction from her. Perhaps she couldn't really grasp the situation. But even so, well... I knew then that we'd come to a turning point. I came straight out with it and said I wanted a divorce. Perhaps if this sarin thing hadn't happened, I wouldn't have said anything. It was a shock to the system and at the same time a kind of trigger. Kenji Ohashi(41) Car dealer married with three children As soon as I got on the train, I noticed two people in odd postures behind me. A man hunched over in his seat, nearly falling off, and a huddled woman, head down and sort of curled up. And then there was this really strange smell. At first I thought there must be some drunk who's thrown up making the place stink. But I got a seat, so I was prepared to put up with a little smell. I soon fell asleep, so when I suddenly heard the announcement 'This station is Nakano-sakaue', I snapped awake, jumped up and left the train. Everything was dim. The lights on the platform were faint. My throat was parched and I was coughing. I went to the water-cooler and gargled. My nose was running and my legs were shaky. I sat down. My lungs were wheezing like I was running a marathon. I was afraid if I lost consciousness I'd be done for. I was taken by police van to Nakano General Hospital. They put me on an IV straight away but we were still wearing our sarin-saturated clothes. Soon the hospital staff were complaining of eye trouble, too. I was in hospital for 12 days: vicious headaches the whole time. No pain-killer worked. I was in agony. The headaches would come in waves all day. They finally discharged me on 31 March and I took a month off work to recuperate at home. First thing in the morning my head would hurt. It was like a killer hangover. I took off all of April, then after the early May holidays I started back on the job. I know I overdid it. Every day it felt like I had some massive weight crushing my skull. One day in August it took me three hours to get to work. I had to stop off all along the route and rest until the pain subsided. I went to see a psychologist at St Luke's Hospital and he said I had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Since then I've been relieved of my managerial responsibilities and only work 8.30am to 3pm. I feel very isolated. I still have headaches all day. There have been times I've contemplated suicide. I almost think I'd be better off dead. If I'd lost an arm, or was reduced to a vegetable, people could probably sympathise more. If only I'd died then, how much easier it would have been. But when I think of my family, I have to go on... Tatsuo Akashi (37) Elder brother of critically injured 'Shizuko Akashi' who was reduced to a vegetative condition by the attack and remains in hospital. I had taken the company car to see a client, when a call came in from the office. I was to contact my mother urgently. 'We had a call from the police,' she said. 'Shizuko was injured in the subway and taken to hospital. Go quickly!' I reached the hospital around noon. The reception was filled with victims. All of them were on drips or getting examined. The doctors weren't much help. All they told me that day was: 'She inhaled a virulent chemical similar to a pesticide.' I waited for two hours and then got to see her just briefly. She was dressed in a hospital gown and lying in bed getting artificial dialysis. She was on several drips. Her eyes were closed. According to the nurse she was in a 'sleeping state'. I reached out to touch her but the doctor held me back; I wasn't wearing gloves. She'd been having convulsions since they brought her in. Her face, to be crude, looked more dead than asleep. She had an oxygen mask over her mouth, and she was expressionless. The device that measured her heartbeat hardly flickered, just an occasional blip. I could hardly bear to look at her. That evening our parents, my wife and kids all came to the hospital. The kids were too small to understand the situation, but seeing them let me get some feelings out. 'Something horrible's happened to Auntie Shizuko ...' I started crying. My kids were upset; they'd never seen me cry before. They tried to comfort me, 'Daddy, Daddy, don't cry!' - and then we were all crying. A few days later, we were shown an X-ray of her head and were told: 'The brain's swollen.' They said there was virtually no chance of further recovery. In other words, while she wasn't a 'vegetable', she would probably remain bedridden for the rest of her life. Unable to sit up, unable to speak, barely aware of anything. Since then, she's had therapy and progressed to the point where she can move her right hand. It's still not easy for her to speak, but she seems to understand most of what we're saying. This year she's been able to laugh. I'll say, 'Who farted?' and she'll answer 'Brother' but whether or not she knows what a 'brother' is is another matter. Most of her memory has disappeared. I go the hospital every other day. It's 11pm by the time I get home. Sundays the whole family goes. My wife's the one I feel sorry for: if she hadn't married me, she wouldn't have to put up with all this. And the kids, too. The night before the attack, the family was saying over dinner 'My, how lucky we are. All together, having a good time' ... a modest share of happiness. Destroyed the very next day by those idiots. They stole what little joy we had. (Tatsuo Akashi is not his real name.) Hiroshige Sugazaki (58) Insurance executive As soon as the train door opened that morning I turned right and got a seat. I looked up to see this man sitting directly to my left wearing a leather coat. 'This guy stinks,' I thought and I stared him right in the eye. He just stared back at me with this 'You-got-a-problem, mister?' look. Then I saw something about the size of a notebook lying at the feet of the second person on my right. A plastic pack with something spilling out of it. Soon there's nobody left at the back of the carriage. Everyone's moved to the front, saying, 'It stinks! It stinks!' By then my head was spinning. I thought to myself 'I really must be anaemic today.' I decided to get off and rest for a while, maybe let two or three trains go by. But when I tried to stand I couldn't get up. My legs had gone. I grabbed the handstrap and sort of dangled from it. I moved from strap to strap until I reached the pole near the door. I grabbed it and just slid down to the floor. They ran a photo of me in the tabloids, so I could see later what happened. I was seen on television, too, lying like that on the carriage floor. I was flat out for at least half an hour. Then the station attendants carried me away. I came to in hospital three days later. I had no awareness of time passing at all. No awareness is paradise. Around that time one of my daughters was pregnant. I'd been anxious about it. It would be my first grandchild. Well, apparently my sister-in-law came in and said to me: 'What if you never see your grandchild's face?' Until then I'd shown absolutely no reaction to anything anyone had said, but this I heard and suddenly regained consciousness. My grandson was born in September, and thanks to him I came back to life. I probably shouldn't say this, but all the nurses were beautiful! I even said so to my wife. For some time after I came around, I was convinced everyone in the world had turned beautiful on me [laughs]. I found nights at the hospital frightening, though. Lying in bed, I'd brush up against the frame of the bed and I'd feel like a cold, damp hand was about to drag me into the darkness. I was sure there was a dead person in the ward whispering 'Come with me! This way, this way...' Back at home it was the same thing. Whenever I stepped on to a tatami mat, whenever I touched anything cold, those fears resurfaced. Even when I took a bath I couldn't do it alone, I was too scared. My wife had to scrub my back. 'Stay with me until I get out,' I told her. 'I don't want to be the last to leave' [laughs]. Some of the victims are afraid to take the subway, even now. I was scared at first, too. I went back to work on 10 May, and from that very first day I took the exact same 7.15 Hibiya Line train that had been targeted in the gas attack. I even made sure I sat in the same carriage - the same seat. At that moment I felt a bit queasy, but having got it over and done with, my spirits lifted. That wiped the slate clean. Yoshiko Wada (31) Widow of Eiji Wada. She was pregnant when her husband died. A daughter, Asuka, was born not long afterwards. I met my husband skiing. This was in February, 1991. We saw each other a lot after that. Every week, and if possible at weekends, too. It really seemed we were made for each other. Like it was fate or something. We were married in June the following year. We hardly ever quarrelled. I was irritable while I was pregnant. I'd get at him for the most trivial things but he just took it all in his stride. He was such a kind person. He seemed to get even kinder before he died. If he got home from work and the cooking had gone wrong he'd just say, 'It's all right, I'll get a take-away.' And when I had morning sickness and could only eat sandwiches and grapefruit jelly, he'd always buy them for me on the way home from work. The day before 20 March we went shopping together. Something he'd ordinarily never do. We went to buy baby clothes and nappies, stuff like that. The next morning he said to me, 'If anything ever happens to me, you know you have to hang on in there and fight.' It was as though he had some kind of premonition. He left the house around 7.30. I pottered about a bit before settling down to watch the Morning Wide Show. Across the TV screen they ran subtitles - 'Such-and-such happened at Tsukiji Station' - but I didn't worry because I thought he commuted by the Marunouchi Line. At 9.30 a call came from the company saying, 'He seems to have got mixed up in this mess. We'll call back later.' Then 10 minutes later, it was, 'He's been taken to Nakajima Hospital. We'll fax you the details so you can get in touch directly.' So I rang them up, but they were in total confusion. 'We can't even keep track of who's here,' they said, and hung up. So all I could do was be patient and wait. It was just before 10 when the call came: 'It looks pretty bad, come to the hospital as quickly as possible.' I was getting ready to leave when they rang again with the message: 'He just died.' I took a taxi to the hospital but by the time I got there the body had been transferred to the central police station in Nihonbashi. I took another taxi. The driver had the news on and they were reading out the names of the deceased. I heard my husband's name. I thought, 'I can't be sure until I see his face. I won't cry until I know for sure' ... I just hoped against hope. They were examining the body, so it was 1.30 before I got to see him in the morgue. They'd laid him out completely naked and covered with a white sheet. 'Don't touch him,' they told me. 'Don't go too near.' If I touched him the sarin would penetrate my skin. But I'd already touched him. He was still warm. There were bloodied bite marks on his lips. Scabs, as if he'd bitten down really hard. And on his ears and nose, too, crusted, where he'd bled. His eyes were shut. I couldn't stay very long because it was 'dangerous'. I was in there less than a minute. 'Why did he have to die?' I said. 'Why did he leave me here?' And I broke down. The body was transferred to Tokyo University Medical Department where, the next day, I bid him a final farewell. They didn't let me touch him then either, nor my mother-in-law. We could only look. I couldn't believe they'd left him overnight in such a lonely place. The only good thing now is Asuka. Some little gesture, some food she likes will remind me of him. I'm always telling Asuka, 'Dada was like this.' When Asuka asks, 'Where's Dada?' I point to the photo on the altar and say, 'Dada, Dada.' She says 'Nighty-night' to the photo before going to sleep. It makes me want to cry. I'm thinking of teaching Asuka to ski. My husband always said he would. I'll wear my husband's gear and teach her. We wore the same size. I think I'll start next season. It's what he would have wanted. The Aum Shinrikyo Cult The trial of the Aum Shinrikyo cult members accused of the subway attack began nearly four years ago, after their sarin gas factory was discovered outside Tokyo. One received a death sentence last year and three have been sentenced to indefinite hard labour. The other six, including part-blind guru Shoko Asahara are still in court. The cult continues to thrive. It now has about 2,000 members and earned \u00a330 million last year from its shops selling cut-price computers. \u0095 This is an extract from Underground by Haruki Murukami (Harvill \u00a320).

      "body": "<p>I didn't see it at first, that short, purple spear poking through the sodden soil. I had to crouch, my knees wobbling, my gumboots sinking deeper and deeper into the Evesham mud to get a proper look. Then I spotted a second close by, then another and then a group of three, all pointing skywards through the bare, dark soil. I would need to pick the entire field if there was to be asparagus for tea. It was only late morning, but the day's cutting was already done. Asparagus waits for no one. </p> <p>But there was asparagus for tea, even so early in the short six-week season, and we ate it in the local style, that is, with melted butter and thin brown bread. None of your chargrilled with sauce Maltaise here. Twelve spears apiece, and a feast in the true sense of the word. No knives and forks, just gingham napkins and much sucking of fingers. I wiped the butter from my chin with the back of my hand. </p> <p>That is what asparagus should be about. If you are using cutlery, then you are not really eating. You are just playing with your food - just like we were always told not to. This is a vegetable to revel in. The six weeks of the British asparagus season are soon over, and I cannot see why we shouldn't gorge ourselves. </p> <p>The older I get, the more I like Asparagus officinalis. At first, in early May, I will dip the spears into nothing more sophisticated than melted butter. I am not sure you really need an egg-and-butter sauce such as Hollandaise with it, but that is what I invariably make. Sometimes it curdles, sometimes it doesn't. As the season whizzes by, I am happier to gild the lily, though that may mean little more than wrapping a piece of thin, air-dried ham such as St Daniele around each spear. </p> <p>If and when I do get fancy, then my asparagus will end up in something that contains dairy products of some sort - in a crumbly tart, perhaps, or in a risotto I finish with butter and grated cheese. I have tried taking the dairy-free route with this vegetable, and it loses all point. </p> <p>This is something to eat as soon as you get it home. A night in the fridge will do your bundle no favours at all. Like the older varieties of sweetcorn, asparagus toughens and loses its sweetness by the hour, but it will be fine on its short journey from Worcestershire or Norfolk. Dry ends, so often hidden by the packer's paper, are difficult to spot, but matter much less than withered spears or open flowers. The fresher it is, the tighter the points will be. </p> <p>I will not agree with those who say that it is unrealistic, xenophobic even, only to eat certain foods in their natural season. I don't care how quickly a bundle of asparagus is flown to us from the Far East, I have never found it compares with locally grown spears in terms of taste or succulence. But there is more to it than timing. To me, eating this particular ingredient out of season just feels wrong. There is something as uncomfortable about eating asparagus in January as there is in watching Wimbledon in November. </p> <p>I do think how and when you eat something is as important as what you eat. If I am to get a meal well and truly right, and why else bother to cook, then the whole experience - the when, the what and the where, if you like - must be considered, too. There is more to a meal than the food on the plate. Yes, of course, I buy the occasional punnet of Chilean blueberries to brighten up a winter fruit salad (they are good with passion fruit and mango), and I don't feel so bad about Spanish strawberries in February, either. But there is something about those shrink-wrapped trays of Guatemalan asparagus that makes my heart sink. </p> <p>I have come across some truly ridiculous methods for cooking asparagus, but any method you choose must protect the delicate spears. I have cooked them in a heap in a large pan of boiling water with only the loss of one tender point, but even that is one too many. There is success to be had in laying your treasure in a deep frying pan full of water, the points resting on the side of the pan, but you end up having to make a daft foil hat for them and scalding yourself into the bargain. </p> <p>Last week, I bought a fine bunch of early Lincolnshire asparagus and wondered if steaming might be a good way to get them to the table in one piece. My longest oval pan is a good size for long, thin vegetables but has no steamer attachment, so I swaddled them in a clean tea towel and tied the ends to the handles. They took a little longer than usual because the lid no longer fitted tight to the pan, but the method seemed appropriate for such valuable cargo and I ended up with perfect spears, tender, succulent and intact, and ate them with nothing but melted butter and brown bread. Evesham might have thought well of me. </p> <p> <strong> Asparagus and mint tart</strong> </p> <p>Serves 6 </p> <p> <strong> for the pastry</strong> </p> <p>90g butter </p> <p>150g plain flour </p> <p>an egg yolk </p> <p>very little water </p> <p><strong> for the filling</strong> </p> <p>12 medium-thick spears of asparagus </p> <p>1 medium carton (284ml) double cream </p> <p>2 eggs </p> <p>12 largish mint leaves </p> <p>3 tbsps grated pecorino or Parmesan </p> <p>Cut the butter into small chunks and rub it into the flour with your fingertips until it resembles coarse fresh breadcrumbs. Mix in the egg yolk and enough water to make a firm dough. You will find you may need about a tablespoon or even less. </p> <p>Roll the dough out to fit a 22cm tart tin (life will be easier when you come to cut the tart if you have a loose-bottomed tin), pressing the pastry right into the corners. Prick the pastry with a fork, then refrigerate it for a good 20 minutes. Don't be tempted to miss out this step - the chilling will stop the pastry from shrinking in the oven. </p> <p>Bake at 200\u00b0C/gas mark 6 for 12-15 minutes until the pastry is pale biscuit-coloured and dry to the touch. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, drop in the asparagus and let it simmer for 7 or 8 minutes or so, until it is quite tender. It will receive more cooking later, but you want it to be thoroughly soft after its time in the oven, and its texture will barely alter under the custard. </p> <p>Put the cream in a jug or bowl and beat in the eggs gently with a fork. Roughly tear up the mint and add that to the cream with a seasoning of salt and black pepper. Slice the asparagus into short lengths, removing any tough ends. </p> <p>Scatter the asparagus over the partly baked pastry case, then pour in the cream and egg mixture, and scatter the cheese over the surface. Bake, with the oven temperature lowered to 180\u00b0C/ gas mark 4, until the filling is golden and set (about 40 minutes). Serve warm. </p> <p> <strong> Roast asparagus</strong> </p> <p> There is no joy in undercooked asparagus. It must be soft and juicy, otherwise it loses much of its magic. Baking the spears in a foil parcel in the oven will suit those who don't like messing around with steam, and keeps the asparagus succulent. Serves 2. </p> <p>450g thin spears of asparagus </p> <p>2 tbsps light, mild, olive oil </p> <p>the juice of 1 lemon </p> <p>Place the asparagus on a large sheet of kitchen foil. Drizzle over the oil and lemon juice and then scatter over a seasoning of salt. Bring the edges of the foil up and seal them tightly (you want the asparagus to cook in its own steam). Bake for 15-20 minutes at 180\u00b0C/gas mark 4 or until the spears are tender. </p> <p> <strong> Warm asparagus with melted cheese</strong> </p> <p> The cheese should melt easily. I have used Taleggio, Brie, Camembert and a Pav\u00e9 d'Affinois with great success. I cannot see why a mild, oozing Gorgonzola would not work either. I am not usually someone who bothers with 'starters', but this would make an elegant start to a more formal dinner. Serves 2. </p> <p>12 spears of asparagus, thick and juicy </p> <p>150g soft, ripe cheese </p> <p>Cook the asparagus in boiling, lightly salted water till it is tender enough to bend. Lift the spears out with a draining spoon and lower them into a shallow baking dish. </p> <p>Remove the crust and slice the cheese thinly, then lay it over the asparagus. Place under a hot grill till the cheese melts. Eat immediately. </p> <p> <strong> Baked asparagus with pancetta</strong> </p> <p> Serves 2 </p> <p>Boil a bundle of asparagus until it is just tender. Drain it carefully, then lay the spears in a shallow baking dish. Heat the oven to 200\u00b0C/gas mark 6. </p> <p>Melt a generous slice of butter in a shallow pan and fry a handful of diced pancetta, or mildly smoked bacon, until its fat is golden.

      "body": "<p>Richard Neat does not like talking about the food he cooks. That's fine; everybody else will do it for him. At the Cannes Film Festival this week, his 45-cover restaurant, on the seafront opposite the Palais des Festivals, is the only place guaranteed to a be at full capacity for every performance. It's been like this since it opened last summer. In February, the Michelin Guide awarded both Neat the restaurant and Neat the chef a single Michelin star. He was the first Englishman working in France ever to manage such a thing.</p> <p>This is the sort of stuff he is more than happy to talk about, even if he feels the 'successful English chef in France' tale is getting a bit worn. But he loves the fact that, as he puts it, his 'star is in the ascendancy in London' by mere virtue of his not being there; that when he took over the restaurant, he upset local trade by getting rid of all the Frenchmen in the kitchen and replacing them with English chefs.</p> <p>Then again, he's known for the grand gesture. After working with Raymond Blanc, Joel Robouchon in Paris and Marco Pierre White (whom he says he 'hates with a passion' - he calls him 'the unwashed chef'), Neat made his name at Pied \u00e0 Terre in London. He picked up his first Michelin star shortly after opening. A little later, he won a second. On the same day it was announced, he quit. He'd had enough, he said. He and his wife Sophie were going travelling in India. Few could understand how a young chef, right at the top of his profession, could quit while so far ahead.</p> <p>He didn't bother to explain. After two years in New Delhi, he simply reappeared on the French Riviera. 'The restaurant in Cannes was always part of the plan,' says Neat, now aged 33. He wanted to be able to spend his downtime on the beach. He wanted somewhere nice to walk his beloved boxer dog. Cannes just made sense. But as to analysing the food he serves there, he won't play. At the end of an extraordinary dinner, I am presented with dessert. By then, Neat has left the kitchen and is sitting at my table, dressed in sweats, the first of his many post-service cigarettes clutched between his long fingers. As each of the seven - count them, seven - other courses arrived, I had been treated to florid descriptions by the waiters: a coulis of this, a velout\u00e9 of the other. But now, as chef is at table, they defer; the dish is simply placed before me. I ask Neat for a description. He leans forward, sniffs and says, 'Bit of white chocolate, some mousse, a few raspberries.' And then he takes another drag on his fag. 'It's the new dessert,' he says. 'Only tried it myself this evening.' His pastry chef designed it, but he was happy enough with the result to let it out of his kitchen.</p> <p>This reluctance to talk food may be down to a general reticence born of precise Englishness. He grew up in a Forces family, and says many chefs have that sort of background. ('All top chefs are right-wingers,' he says at one point, with a toothy grin. 'We're all rampant capitalists, too. Can we charge 30 quid for the turbot? No, make it 36 quid. That sort of thing.') In this kind of world, it's about doing rather than saying. Partly, I think, he feels there are few who know enough about this level of cooking with whom he can have a proper conversation. But I also think he's simply content for the cooking to speak for itself.</p> <p>And boy, is it articulate. It should be said that this meal was not eaten under the usual conditions of The Observer restaurant review. Which is to say I didn't go there anonymously and the paper didn't cough up. But with cooking of this calibre, it was hardly likely to cloud my judgment. If anything, the one Michelin star is misleading. This is at least a notch up from that, but the Michelin organisation was never likely to bestow the full accolade on a chef just seven months after opening - and certainly not on an English one. </p> <p> I began with an amuse-gueule of rillettes of red mullet on an almond and prune sauce. Rillettes of fish are usually made with butter. Here, Neat used goose fat. It was rich without being cloying, and the gentle sweetness of the sauce firmly anchored it. Next came a tian of dense brown crabmeat wrapped in skate wing on a refreshing cucumber velout\u00e9. The third course was Neat's signature dish, and the only one to have followed him from Pied \u00e0 Terre: escargots rolled in a light chicken mousse and dusted in chopped morels on a wild mushroom sauce. It was a dark and meaty combination and fully deserving of the praise it has received whenever it has turned up on one of Neat's menus. </p> <p>And onwards we rolled, each course a measured few forkfuls all designed to make this parade manageable. The crab was followed by a second fish course: pan-fried sea bass on a dark and salty bouillabaise reduction. Next came melting sweetbreads wrapped in parma ham on a bed of polenta and wild mushrooms. </p> <p>All these were served with a big flowery Gew\u00fcrtztraminer from the Hugel winery in Alsace, chosen by sommelier Bruno Asselin. There was cheese served with port, a tiny thimble of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e followed by a chocolate and raspberry dessert with a glass of Beaumes de Venise. Listed like this, it looks obscene, and in a way it probably is. But this is Neat's tasting menu, and in the measurement of portions and the contrasting of ingredients, it does boast a real kind of art. </p> <p>Despite the turbot crack, his food is also not fiendishly expensive. There is a three-course dinner menu at around \u00a327 and even the carte would keep things pegged back around the \u00a340 a head mark for the food, which for cooking of this calibre is not extortionate. You can pay that and more for disappointing style-over-content exercises in any of London's new restaurants.</p> <p>Soon Neat intends to take them on, too. He is returning to London later this year to open a new brasserie. He will spend two days a week in Britain, the rest in Cannes. 'I'm restless,' he says. 'And I have two guys in my kitchen here who will soon be ready to run their own places. It would be better if I had them working for me for a while in the new place rather than leaving the company.' He won't say much about the new place except that, compared to Neat in Cannes, it will be 'rough and ready'. </p> <p>He knows that starting the London operation will mean the end of the tight family he has created in France. 'I'll probably never work in such a good, professional and fun environment ever again,' he says, almost wistfully. He is, it seems, in the fortunate position of having the time of his life and knowing it. Happily, the pleasure he is having is showing up in exactly the right place: on the plate. </p> <p>\u0095 Neat, 11 Square Merim\u00e9e, Cannes (0033 9399 2919). Dinner for two, including wine and service, costs about \u00a3100</p>",

The third course was Neat's signature dish, and the only one to have followed him from Pied \u00e0 Terre: escargots rolled in a light chicken mousse and dusted in chopped morels on a wild mushroom sauce. It was a dark and meaty combination and fully deserving of the praise it has received whenever it has turned up on one of Neat's menus. And onwards we rolled, each course a measured few forkfuls all designed to make this parade manageable. The crab was followed by a second fish course: pan-fried sea bass on a dark and salty bouillabaise reduction. Next came melting sweetbreads wrapped in parma ham on a bed of polenta and wild mushrooms. All these were served with a big flowery Gew\u00fcrtztraminer from the Hugel winery in Alsace, chosen by sommelier Bruno Asselin. There was cheese served with port, a tiny thimble of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e followed by a chocolate and raspberry dessert with a glass of Beaumes de Venise. Listed like this, it looks obscene, and in a way it probably is. But this is Neat's tasting menu, and in the measurement of portions and the contrasting of ingredients, it does boast a real kind of art. Despite the turbot crack, his food is also not fiendishly expensive. There is a three-course dinner menu at around \u00a327 and even the carte would keep things pegged back around the \u00a340 a head mark for the food, which for cooking of this calibre is not extortionate. You can pay that and more for disappointing style-over-content exercises in any of London's new restaurants. Soon Neat intends to take them on, too. He is returning to London later this year to open a new brasserie. He will spend two days a week in Britain, the rest in Cannes. 'I'm restless,' he says. 'And I have two guys in my kitchen here who will soon be ready to run their own places. It would be better if I had them working for me for a while in the new place rather than leaving the company.' He won't say much about the new place except that, compared to Neat in Cannes, it will be 'rough and ready'. He knows that starting the London operation will mean the end of the tight family he has created in France. 'I'll probably never work in such a good, professional and fun environment ever again,' he says, almost wistfully. He is, it seems, in the fortunate position of having the time of his life and knowing it. Happily, the pleasure he is having is showing up in exactly the right place: on the plate. \u0095 Neat, 11 Square Merim\u00e9e, Cannes (0033 9399 2919). Dinner for two, including wine and service, costs about \u00a3100",

A worm, in contrast, is 'a program that propagates itself over a network, reproducing itself as it goes'. </p> <p>So was the love bug a virus or a worm? The CERT software co-ordination center at Carnegie-Mellon University, normally considered the definitive authority on these matters, was careful to describe it as a worm. Yet it is clear that the infection was disseminated like a virus, by humans engaging in what Dr. Johnson would call epistolary intercourse. </p> <p>What went unreported was the fact that the only systems affected were, according to CERT, 'systems running Microsoft Windows with Windows Scripting Host enabled'.

Or, as Scott Rosenberg put it in Salon, 'using Outlook is like hanging a sign on your back that reads: \"Please mess with my computer\".' </p> <p>Actually, the problem is not just with Outlook but with the entire Windows architecture. The Microsoft philosophy is to create a completely integrated system in which all the components - Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Internet Explorer - are seamlessly interconnected. Bill Gates says this is to make life easier for consumers by giving them one-shop computing without having to worry about the details. The US government says it's his scheme for taking over the world. </p> <p>Whatever the interpretation, the effect of the Windows architecture is the same: it creates a system on your computer which is vulnerable to attack because if an intruder program can infect any component, it can easily subvert the others. </p> <p>In an odd way, therefore, the love bug problem and the Microsoft anti-trust case are linked. In an extended whinge in Time magazine, Gates railed against the Department of Justice's 'profound hostility' to Microsoft's efforts to 'make products that work well with one another'. </p> <p>Later in the same piece he argued that the company should not be broken up because 'updates to Windows and Office technologies that could, for example, protect against attacks such as the love bug virus would also be much harder for computer users to obtain'. </p> <p>In other words: Microsoft should be allowed to sell systemically vulnerable software systems because that makes it easier to get fixes when their vulnerabilities are exposed. </p> <p>I've always thought Gates would go mad in the end. It seems he's shaping up nicely. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:John.Naughton@observer.co.uk\">John.Naughton@observer.co.uk</a> </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/\">www.briefhistory.com/footnotes</a></p>",

Or, as Scott Rosenberg put it in Salon, 'using Outlook is like hanging a sign on your back that reads: \"Please mess with my computer\".' Actually, the problem is not just with Outlook but with the entire Windows architecture. The Microsoft philosophy is to create a completely integrated system in which all the components - Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Internet Explorer - are seamlessly interconnected. Bill Gates says this is to make life easier for consumers by giving them one-shop computing without having to worry about the details. The US government says it's his scheme for taking over the world. Whatever the interpretation, the effect of the Windows architecture is the same: it creates a system on your computer which is vulnerable to attack because if an intruder program can infect any component, it can easily subvert the others. In an odd way, therefore, the love bug problem and the Microsoft anti-trust case are linked. In an extended whinge in Time magazine, Gates railed against the Department of Justice's 'profound hostility' to Microsoft's efforts to 'make products that work well with one another'. Later in the same piece he argued that the company should not be broken up because 'updates to Windows and Office technologies that could, for example, protect against attacks such as the love bug virus would also be much harder for computer users to obtain'. In other words: Microsoft should be allowed to sell systemically vulnerable software systems because that makes it easier to get fixes when their vulnerabilities are exposed. I've always thought Gates would go mad in the end. It seems he's shaping up nicely. John.Naughton@observer.co.uk \u0095 www.briefhistory.com/footnotes",

Needless to say, the next day we are well fatigued, and it's not even as if we can catch up on our sleep what with the racket of the kids thrilling to the opportunity of going berserk in someone else's house and the steam hissing out of grandpa's ears, not to mention (though I might as well) my wife's mother, who has so entirely run out of walls to be driven up that by teatime she is reduced to tutting into a megaphone fashioned from The Daily Telegraph. </p> <p>Next morning, we leave the older generation contentedly smoking their heads off in their matching orthopaedic recliners and drive off up the A61 to Knaresborough, which is world-famous for Mother Shipton, an old hag who was born in a cave and was almost burnt at the stake by Cardinal Wolsey for prophesying the dissolution of the monasteries and the Great Plague and for all I know the casual misuse of the apostrophe in pub menu's. Lucky for her, Wolsey was himself less generously endowed in the way of knowing what was going to happen next and indeed had barely had time to buy a packet of firelighters when he was captured by the King's men and charged with treason for making the Inland Revenue unpopular and being so useless at putting a good word in with the Pope for Henry VIII, who merely wanted to marry the new woman in his life before he had quite got round to remembering to kill the old one! </p> <p>The eldest takes a sudden interest. 'So she's the one married to that doctor who murdered all those women?' </p> <p>'No, no,' says my wife, 'Ship- ton not Ship- man. He was from Lancashire.' </p> <p>Knaresborough is a beautiful place, though it does get slightly defiled on a warm day by people like us turning up, clogging the streets and eating all the ice cream and crisps. We park the car and take the bluebell path to the petrifying well, which has a washing line strung across it with hats and gloves and teddy bears that have been magically turned to stone by the running water, which has amazing powers. The children are entranced until the guide starts going into detail about aquifers and the position of calcium carbonate in the league table of interesting minerals. 'It's unique,' he adds, as though creating a lump of rock out of a handbag were some kind of marketable invention. I mean, maybe if they could do it the other way round </p> <p>Still, very interesting, I'm sure. We go to the cave where Mother Shipton was born in 1488, and the children get to put their hands in the wishing well and give it their best for world peace (or possibly rare Pok\u00e9mon cards) before being forced to climb the hill to the castle overlooking the craggy gorge and handsome Victorian viaduct and river dotted with people crashing into each other in boats. 'Hey, cool! Dad, can we go out on a boat?' </p> <p>'Of course we can!' says my wife, who knows full well I would rather have my ears cut off than travel by water in the pursuance of nothing more urgent than amusement. </p> <p>'What if we fall in?' wails the nine-year-old. </p> <p>'Yes, what if we fall in?' I repeat. My wife gives me a much-needed poke in the ribs with her captain's telescope and 20 minutes later, we're going round in circles, her rowing, me at the back trying to steer with three children wedged between my legs, the eldest at the front loudly picking holes in my knowledge of left and right. At last, we're zigzagging up the river, and though I do seem to get more than my fair share of earache every time my wife gets her hair snagged in the branches of overhanging trees, or when the little ones suddenly decide to test Archimedes's principle of not leaping to one side of a boat to examine a floating leaf, I have to admit, at no time do we officially sink. Which is odd I don't remember making a wish. </p> <p> Titanic videos to <a href=\"'mailto:phil.hogan@observer.co.uk'\"> phil.hogan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

The children are entranced until the guide starts going into detail about aquifers and the position of calcium carbonate in the league table of interesting minerals. 'It's unique,' he adds, as though creating a lump of rock out of a handbag were some kind of marketable invention. I mean, maybe if they could do it the other way round Still, very interesting, I'm sure. We go to the cave where Mother Shipton was born in 1488, and the children get to put their hands in the wishing well and give it their best for world peace (or possibly rare Pok\u00e9mon cards) before being forced to climb the hill to the castle overlooking the craggy gorge and handsome Victorian viaduct and river dotted with people crashing into each other in boats. 'Hey, cool! Dad, can we go out on a boat?' 'Of course we can!' says my wife, who knows full well I would rather have my ears cut off than travel by water in the pursuance of nothing more urgent than amusement. 'What if we fall in?' wails the nine-year-old. 'Yes, what if we fall in?' I repeat. My wife gives me a much-needed poke in the ribs with her captain's telescope and 20 minutes later, we're going round in circles, her rowing, me at the back trying to steer with three children wedged between my legs, the eldest at the front loudly picking holes in my knowledge of left and right. At last, we're zigzagging up the river, and though I do seem to get more than my fair share of earache every time my wife gets her hair snagged in the branches of overhanging trees, or when the little ones suddenly decide to test Archimedes's principle of not leaping to one side of a boat to examine a floating leaf, I have to admit, at no time do we officially sink. Which is odd I don't remember making a wish. Titanic videos to phil.hogan@observer.co.uk",

William Goldman is the author of, for my money, the single best book about Hollywood, Adventures in the Screen Trade. First published here in 1983, it is a book I've given away so often that I am now reduced to a sad, coffee-stained and broken-backed paperback edition bearing the now-forgotten Futura imprint. The volume under review has a helpful subtitle, which tells us that Goldman has written a sequel, a genre that he pungently characterises as the work of 'whores'. </p> <p>Having unburdened himself of this obiter dicta, I guess Goldman then decided that if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and settled down for a profitable session in American literature's red-light district. Fans of 'Adventures' will be relieved to hear that Which Lie Did I Tell?, the dirty sister, is easily the equal of its more chaste and fairer sibling.</p> <p>Once again, Goldman takes us backstage at the dream factory and then, like an ancient mariner on Sunset Boulevard, buttonholes the reader with a succession of wicked anecdotes, irreverent asides and behind-the-scenes scuttlebut interspersed with enough nearly actionable gossip to keep a reasonably diligent midtown lawyer in profitable work from Cannes to Christmas. Rather more than 'Adventures' it provides an informal (and, boy, is Goldman informal, or what?) masterclass in screenwriting, with learned references from Chinatown to North by Northwest. </p> <p>This is hardly surprising. In case you didn't know, and by way of further explanation, Goldman is also the author of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , Marathon Man and The Princess Bride, three of the most successful Hollywood films of the past 50 years. So when he's telling you what he knows about movies and storytelling, you are getting it from the front end of the horse. If you want the other stuff, what Goldman calls 'Hollywood horseshit', you have only to read Robert McKee, the author of Story, possibly the silliest and most pretentious book about filmmaking ever published.</p> <p>Goldman, by contrast, knows the enchanting mystery of 'story' inside out, though he's far too savvy to claim that a successful piece of cinematic storytelling is anything but the happy conjunction of chance, good luck and good instincts. As he writes, in words that should be pinned up in the seminar rooms of creative writing schools around the world: 'I am, alas, a totally instinctive writer, with - please believe this - next to no idea [sic] of what I'm doing.' </p> <p>It's this refreshing understanding of the supreme difficulty of natural good storytelling that gives his book such assurance and authority. He is also funny and perceptive about 'just how fragile movies are, how even the greatest successes run, at least for a while, neck and neck with failure.' </p> <p>Goldman is supremely quotable. Famous in the business for the arresting turn of phrase, he's come up with a harvest of new zingers, though not one mot quite so juste as his immortal 'nobody knows anything', a phrase that will probably be chiselled into his gravestone. Goldman is also wise. 'An original screenplay? Nothing to it, really. Just come up with a new and fresh and different story that builds logically to a satisfying and surprising conclusion... Do you know how hard that is?'</p> <p>And so on and so on. Even if you think fiction is what happens to ball-bearings and that the basic appeal of movies is, as Pauline Kael once said, 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', what Goldman has to say is of real consequence. Stripped of the 'Hollywood horseshit' this book simply addresses that profound and age-old question: What do people do round the campfire at night? (Answer: spin yarns). </p> <p>The other reason why Goldman holds our attention, and it's related to the first, is that having decided to pay a visit to the bordello, he gives the reader a very high class of pillowtalk. If you want to know what the producer yelled at Richard Attenborough during the over-budget shooting of A Bridge Too Far; or what Michael Douglas said to Val Kilmer; or how Billy Crystal inspired that brilliant pay-off line (\"I'll have what she's having\") to the famous orgasm scene in Nora Ephron's When Harry Met Sally; or the latest on Gwyneth or Cate, then this is a book no movie buff should fail to beg, borrow or steal.</p> <p>As well as telling us about how his own films got made (excellent chapters on Misery, Maverick and Absolute Power) and about his famous movie-making friends and adversaries, Goldman lets slip quite a bit about himself, and it's all revealing. He is, for example, frank in his admiration of his dead brother Jim, the author of Follies and The Lion in Winter. Jim, apparently, was 'the one who was programmed to succeed'. Compared to his brother, Goldman thought himself, he says, to be 'a fraud'. </p> <p>He went into film because he felt unworthy to be a novelist. 'In my heart,' he writes sadly, 'I'm a novelist who happens to write screenplays.' Goldman may not be much of a novelist. Who, outside America, has ever heard of, let alone actually read, Your Turn to Curtsey, My Turn to Bow (1958) or No Way to Treat a Lady (1964) or The Color of Light (1984)? What his fiction writing has taught him, however, is that if you get the tone right, almost anything goes. The triumph of Adventures in the Screen Trade and Which Lie Did I Tell? is the triumph of tone. </p> <p>By creating, on the page, the voice of a seen-it-all, been-there-done-that veteran, a salty but star-struck barfly who's watched the human comedy unfolding on the sound stages of Universal, Warner Bros and MGM, he has created the perfect vehicle for what is, of course, a deep and lifelong love-affair with the city of silver dreams.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Orange Order failed to expel a convicted sex offender who became the first person in Northern Ireland banned from loitering near schools. James McGivern, 57, of Lime Grove in Lurgan, appeared in court last Monday where he was ordered to avoid schools, parks, playgrounds and teenage discos after complaints from parents in the Craigavon area. McGivern, who has two convictions for sex offences in the early Nineties, belongs to an Orange Lodge in Portadown and is a member of Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian church there. He belongs to Orange lodge LOL 352 - the Derrykeevin Temperance Lodge - whose members are teetotal on religious grounds. According to the Orange Order rulebook a member can be expelled if found guilty of 'conduct unbecoming of an Orangeman'. Despite convictions dating back a decade, McGivern remained a member of LOL 352, attending protests at Drumcree. RUC officers convinced the court to ban McGivern from schools, parks, playgrounds and other places where children played. He can be arrested if seen near such places.

      "bodyText": "In a clear concession to David Trimble, the British Government moved yesterday to prevent Sinn Fein Ministers in a new power-sharing Executive banning Union flags from public buildings. Legislation will be introduced next week in Parliament enabling Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, to overrule any Minister in the Belfast administration who tried to stop the flag flying above government offices. While Mandelson's move partially calms unionist fears, it is unlikely that Trimble will wrest any major concessions over the Patten report on the RUC's future. The Ulster Unionist leader wants the RUC's name incorporated in the force's new title - the Police Service of Northern Ireland - but the Irish government, the SDLP and Sinn Fein have successfully fought off attempts to water down the Patten report. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has warned that any tampering with the Patten report could undermine last weekend's IRA initiative. Trimble is seeking changes in the Patten report before Saturday's crucial meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council at which 860 delegates will vote to accept the IRA's offer of arms being put beyond use and the independent verification of their weapons dumps. An Ulster Unionist spokesman said the legislation on flags was 'better than nothing' but held dangers. One of the aspects of the 72 days of power-sharing which angered unionists the most was the decision by Sinn Fein Education Minister Martin McGuinness and Health Minister Bairbre de Brun to order the Union flag removed from their ministerial buildings. 'It's fair to say that the Union flag would be safe under Mandelson whom we trust, but what if Mo Mowlam had still been in place? Could we have trusted her to take our side if Sinn Fein Ministers wanted to tear down the flag over Stormont buildings? It will depend in the end on the personality in the post of Secretary of State,' the UUP spokesman said.

      "bodyText": "Prince Charles's much criticised village development of Poundbury in Dorset will receive a surprising boost tomorrow when a Government report holds it up as a shining example of the 'anti-Brookside' style of architecture it wants to encourage. The report by officials at the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions will say the village on the outskirts of Dorchester gives people a real sense of community. 'I've seen the past and it works,' said Francis Golding, an architectural consultant and one of the authors of the report. 'OK, so it's retro but it is a development that has been given real attention.' Poundbury has been at the centre of a bitter debate about how to build new housing since it was launched on a sceptical public in the mid-Nineties. The prince, who has put his name to the development of new homes and an enterprise centre, said he wanted to see a departure from the 'terrible' architecture of most modern housing and that Poundbury would be in sharp contrast to the Sixties idea of stuffing people in tower blocks. The development has split the architectural community. Many described it as a pastiche of a non-existent 'village past' and pointed out that it was built on a greenfield site rather than on a site of urban decay, which environmentalists say is better use of scarce land resources. Although the first residents who moved in were optimistic that they could create a new community, the development was attacked last year for having no shops, post office, village hall, pub or church. The council estate which sits behind Poundbury is fenced off, creating, critics say, an 'us and them' environment, and the five-storey retirement home in the centre of the village has been attacked for dominating the skyline for miles around. The report, which will be launched by Environment Minister Nick Raynsford, will say that although Poundbury has its drawbacks it is a development where thought has been given to how the buildings work together and what people who live there think. Other developments which will be praised include the Glasgow development at Glasgow Green, the Caspar buildings in Birmingham, the Piggeries in Frome, Somerset, and the Seven Dials development in London's Covent Garden. 'We want to get away from the \"cul-de-sac\" culture where new developments are built around roads that don't go anywhere,' Golding said, citing myriad examples of executive housing estates that use architecture styles now dismissed as 'Tudorbethan', an ugly mixture of faux Tudor and Elizabethan styles which look the same whether they are built on the outskirts of Edinburgh or Brighton. 'Builders say that these are the type of houses that people want, but I have seen little evidence of that,' said Ian Ritchie, an architect and member of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, which is backing the report. Maxwell Hutchinson, an architect and former president of the Royal Institute of Architecture, said he was surprised by the conservatism implied by the report's backing of Poundbury. 'There has been a growing consensus that new building should be on brownfield sites like Greenwich and not on greenfield sites like Poundbury,' he said. He said that support for the prince's pet project flies in the face of recent developments which had revealed 'a renaissance in the British attitude to architecture.

Mugabe will force the tens of thousands of people involved to obey the letter of his country's law, which makes dual nationality illegal, said the state-owned Herald newspaper. Instead of having the rights of full citizens, those stripped of their Zimbabwean citizenship will be merely resident British nationals. The move - which some observers interpreted as a possible precursor to mass expulsions of the farmers - appeared to catch the British Government off guard. The ruling was widely viewed as a manoeuvre to prevent thousands of whites from voting in a general election due by August. In London one Foreign Office source said: 'We have insisted that Mr Mugabe should stay within the rule of law. This is a difficult issue because it clearly is the law in Zimbabwe, and we are cautious about walking into a trap.' The decision puts further pressure on the besieged farming community, despite apparently conciliatory talks they held with Mugabe last Friday.

      "body": "<p>On a hot, humid day three years ago the rebels hacked off Jonah Dumbuya's right arm and his ears.</p> <p>The 23-year-old teacher was walking through the bush near his village when he was surrounded by armed men and forced to the ground. After their work, the rebels gave the him a letter to take to the government asking for a new arm.</p> <p>'If you want to know the value of a diamond in Sierra Leone you should take all the arms and legs they chopped off and put them on one side, and all the diamonds dug up over the past 10 years and put them on the other, and then you divide one into the other. That is the value of a diamond in Sierra Leone,' said Dumbuya.</p> <p>He may not know it, but he is a tiny and bloody link in a huge and complex chain that links cities from New York and London to Tel Aviv and Johannesburg; that links the richest countries of the world with the very poorest, that links warehouses full of Kalashnikov rifles in Eastern Europe with huts full of maimed children in tropical jungles; that links the gleaming gems on the ring fingers of half the world's brides with blood and sweat and pain. They are gems fuelling half a continent's wars.</p> <p>The trail starts in places like the dusty town of Catoca in Angola, or in the jungles around the war-scarred city of Kisangani in the Congo. Catoca is a huge industrial site where 1,000 workers and huge earthmovers sift yellow, arid dust. It is guarded by heavily armed paramilitary troops.</p> <p>Around Kisangani the scene is different. Deep in the fetid rainforest, half-naked men work around the clock with sieves and a shovels in the hope that they will be lucky just this once and that their lives will change. Usually they find just a $20 stone which, if not stolen by local bandits or ill-disciplined Congolese troops, might buy them enough food to give them the strength to go on digging.</p> <p>For all its immense variety the African diamond trade is a slick, well-run business. From the bottom - the myriad workers slaving under the hot sun - to the consumers on the high streets of London, the stones move efficiently along well-worked routes. First, in the case of the small mines, the miner will sell his gem to a local dealer. The dealer will have split the haul with the local military commander, who will pass his stash on to his seniors. After taking a little for themselves - they pass the growing hoard on towards the top.</p> <p>With armies of up to 35,000 troops, spread over hundreds of thousands of square diamond-rich miles, huge quantities of diamonds amass quickly. Local warlords - or governments - typically sell concessions for the bigger mines, and the concession-owners then feed the gems on to the world market.</p> <p>Either way, the amounts involved are huge. Jonas Savimbi, who leads the Unita guerrilla movement in Angola, has spent an estimated \u00a32 billion on supplies for his rag-tag army in the last 10 years. Diamonds have allowed him to convert a motley group of ill-trained fighters into one of the best armed irregular forces in the world, capable of fighting a war that has cost 500,000 lives.</p> <p>The poor African state of Liberia has, according to a US State Department report, sent out at least \u00a3200 million worth of diamonds a year, though it has no real gem reserves of its own. Almost all the diamonds were from Sierra Leone, and were collected by troops loyal to Foday Sankoh, the rebel Revolutionary United Front leader whose troops look set to confront the British Army within days.</p> <p>The sheer wealth involved explains why Sankoh is willing to take such risks to prevent United Nations troops entering the key diamond producing areas in the East of the country.</p> <p>US State Department sources estimate that between 10 and 15 per cent of the global diamond trade - worth between $5bn and $7bn a year - is made up of smuggled and illicit stones. That sort of money buys a lot of AK47s.</p> <p>Though men like Sankoh and Savimbi are the key figures, a host of minor players have essential roles. Dozens of different African countries are involved, both directly in the trade and in the conflict it provokes. Some, such as Blaise Compaore, the President of Burkina Faso, and Charles Taylor, the leader of Liberia, help by facilitating the transfer of diamonds from 'conflict' countries to circumvent many of the controls placed on the trade by the UN, other regulators and the big diamond companies such as De Beers. Others help fuel the trade by providing military support to warlords in return for packets of stones or permission to mine, such as the governments of Sudan, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's involvement is particularly murky. Critics of President Robert Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe accuse the elderly autocrat of committing 11,000 of his country's troops to the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo in return for vastly lucrative concessions on its diamond fields.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's economy suffers enormously, hundreds of its soldiers are being killed and Mugabe and senior army officers are getting richer.</p> <p>But the system would fall apart without the shadowy group of western middlemen who set up the deals, fly the diamonds to the main dealing markets in the West and supply the weapons that the Africans so desperately want. It would also collapse without commercial agreements that keep diamond prices high.</p> <p>A recent UN report into the failure of the sanctions imposed to stop the trading of stones from Angola lists a score of men such as Victor Bout, a Russian former KGB agent who runs an airfreight service out of Dubai, and the De Decker brothers, two South African businessmen alleged to have funnelled weapons into - and gems out of - half the countries along the continent's west coast.</p> <p>Another key figure named is a Dutch national called Jacobus Witteveen. According to the researchers he has procured arms for Unita and owns his own Antwerp-based diamond firm.</p> <p>The Observer has also learnt that at least two British-based companies are involved in the trade, and that a number of mercenary organisations with UK links have been drawn into the shadowy world of smuggled diamonds. There are even some British mercenaries who are reported to have trained the rebels in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The UN report's findings are confirmed by US State Department and Central Intelligence Agency sources. It reveals that almost all the weapons being flown into Africa come from Eastern Europe. Most are from Bulgaria, though increasing quantities are now sourced in the Ukraine. Everything from tank parts and multiple rocket launchers to handguns and bayonets are flown in, often with trainers. The Sierra Leone rebels are reported to have former Soviet surface-to-air missiles. At the height of the Angolan war, 22 Ilyushin transport aircraft were landing on a single airstrip each night. Without such arms supplies, war on the scale seen now in Africa would be impossible.</p> <p>The consequences of the rush for the diamonds - and the bloody fighting that it provokes - are obvious. 'Even the Cold War superpowers did not allow the wholesale ripping up of the economy, the use of children as soldiers and attacks on relief groups,' says Herbert Rowe, political scientist and Africa specialist at Georgetown University in Washington.</p> <p>As for Sierra Leone, the UN report blames diamonds for 'destabilising the country for the better part of three decades, stealing its patrimony and robbing an entire generation of children, putting the country dead last in the UN's human development index'.</p> <p>The key to the whole system that drives the diamond wars is found, however, not in a stinking bush war bunker but in one of Europe's most well-heeled cities.</p> <p>Two thirds of the world's diamond trade is dealt through the Belgian port of Antwerp. It is there that, campaigners allege, the blood-stained stones from African conflicts are laundered clean and sent out to be worn on the fingers of lovers around the world.</p> <p>On Antwerp's sunny, tree-lined Pelikanstraat, amorous couples wander, gawping at the baubles on display in the shop windows. The real business, however, is done on the grey functional walkway round the corner called the Hovenierstraat. Here diamonds, both rough and polished, are dealt wholesale to the tune of $20bn a year.</p> <p>The street is overshadowed by a series of huge office blocks: the five main diamond exchanges. For years, when the warlords of Africa placed their packets of rough diamonds into the sweaty hands of their arms dealer's gem experts, it was to the cramped rooms behind these doors that the gems were brought to be evaluated and sold. A culture of turning a blind eye to a stone's provenance gave the city an ugly reputation as the world's leading gem-laundering centre.</p> <p>The Antwerp trade's governing body, the Diamond High Council (HRD), says business is now reformed. Youri Steverlynck, a spokesperson, maintained that the body has imposed tough new rules. The latest regulation, introduced late last year, means that independent experts check that no diamonds have been imported or exported without documents proving the gems are not from war zones, he said.</p> <p>But the reform has its limits.

'People here don't care where [rough diamonds] come from,' he said. 'Money, mines and the right people are all there together in Africa. You can send in the UN, but they can't control it. It's a small world, your name matters and everyone trusts each other to keep quiet.'</p> <p>The UN report is uncompromising.

A disparate alliance is gradually forming to force change.</p> <p>Three weeks ago, key American diplomatic and development staff stationed in Sierra Leone called a meeting. Around a table the suited officials sat opposite a number of key mining figures and half a dozen rival military commanders, including rebel leader Sankoh and representatives of the government.

One American source said the RUF was 'intransigent' over control of the mining areas and the sort of distribution of profits that was envisaged by the peace agreement last year. Finally, an exasperated UN commander is reported to have said the peacekeeping force would attempt to seize back control of the country's mining areas before the end of July. Now that operation has begun, under the leadership of the British Army.</p> <p>The fact that the Americans called the crucial meeting - even if it ended badly - shows that curbing the trade's excesses is finally being seriously discussed in the western corridors of power.</p> <p>State Department officials say the American administration is likely to propose a global marketing system in which diamond sales must be accompanied by documents declaring their source and destination. The aim would be a multilateral treaty signed by African nations and overseen by the US.</p> <p>Diplomatic pressure is being brought to bear on Belgium, and a close eye is being kept on the burgeoning diamond markets of Tel Aviv and Kiev. The Foreign Office has been lobbying quietly for reform.</p> <p>Other factors may help too. New mines in Canada are threatening to undercut prices.

      "bodyText": "On a hot, humid day three years ago the rebels hacked off Jonah Dumbuya's right arm and his ears. The 23-year-old teacher was walking through the bush near his village when he was surrounded by armed men and forced to the ground. After their work, the rebels gave the him a letter to take to the government asking for a new arm. 'If you want to know the value of a diamond in Sierra Leone you should take all the arms and legs they chopped off and put them on one side, and all the diamonds dug up over the past 10 years and put them on the other, and then you divide one into the other. That is the value of a diamond in Sierra Leone,' said Dumbuya. He may not know it, but he is a tiny and bloody link in a huge and complex chain that links cities from New York and London to Tel Aviv and Johannesburg; that links the richest countries of the world with the very poorest, that links warehouses full of Kalashnikov rifles in Eastern Europe with huts full of maimed children in tropical jungles; that links the gleaming gems on the ring fingers of half the world's brides with blood and sweat and pain. They are gems fuelling half a continent's wars. The trail starts in places like the dusty town of Catoca in Angola, or in the jungles around the war-scarred city of Kisangani in the Congo. Catoca is a huge industrial site where 1,000 workers and huge earthmovers sift yellow, arid dust. It is guarded by heavily armed paramilitary troops. Around Kisangani the scene is different. Deep in the fetid rainforest, half-naked men work around the clock with sieves and a shovels in the hope that they will be lucky just this once and that their lives will change. Usually they find just a $20 stone which, if not stolen by local bandits or ill-disciplined Congolese troops, might buy them enough food to give them the strength to go on digging. For all its immense variety the African diamond trade is a slick, well-run business. From the bottom - the myriad workers slaving under the hot sun - to the consumers on the high streets of London, the stones move efficiently along well-worked routes. First, in the case of the small mines, the miner will sell his gem to a local dealer. The dealer will have split the haul with the local military commander, who will pass his stash on to his seniors. After taking a little for themselves - they pass the growing hoard on towards the top. With armies of up to 35,000 troops, spread over hundreds of thousands of square diamond-rich miles, huge quantities of diamonds amass quickly. Local warlords - or governments - typically sell concessions for the bigger mines, and the concession-owners then feed the gems on to the world market. Either way, the amounts involved are huge. Jonas Savimbi, who leads the Unita guerrilla movement in Angola, has spent an estimated \u00a32 billion on supplies for his rag-tag army in the last 10 years. Diamonds have allowed him to convert a motley group of ill-trained fighters into one of the best armed irregular forces in the world, capable of fighting a war that has cost 500,000 lives. The poor African state of Liberia has, according to a US State Department report, sent out at least \u00a3200 million worth of diamonds a year, though it has no real gem reserves of its own. Almost all the diamonds were from Sierra Leone, and were collected by troops loyal to Foday Sankoh, the rebel Revolutionary United Front leader whose troops look set to confront the British Army within days. The sheer wealth involved explains why Sankoh is willing to take such risks to prevent United Nations troops entering the key diamond producing areas in the East of the country. US State Department sources estimate that between 10 and 15 per cent of the global diamond trade - worth between $5bn and $7bn a year - is made up of smuggled and illicit stones. That sort of money buys a lot of AK47s. Though men like Sankoh and Savimbi are the key figures, a host of minor players have essential roles. Dozens of different African countries are involved, both directly in the trade and in the conflict it provokes. Some, such as Blaise Compaore, the President of Burkina Faso, and Charles Taylor, the leader of Liberia, help by facilitating the transfer of diamonds from 'conflict' countries to circumvent many of the controls placed on the trade by the UN, other regulators and the big diamond companies such as De Beers. Others help fuel the trade by providing military support to warlords in return for packets of stones or permission to mine, such as the governments of Sudan, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Zimbabwe's involvement is particularly murky. Critics of President Robert Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe accuse the elderly autocrat of committing 11,000 of his country's troops to the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo in return for vastly lucrative concessions on its diamond fields. Zimbabwe's economy suffers enormously, hundreds of its soldiers are being killed and Mugabe and senior army officers are getting richer. But the system would fall apart without the shadowy group of western middlemen who set up the deals, fly the diamonds to the main dealing markets in the West and supply the weapons that the Africans so desperately want. It would also collapse without commercial agreements that keep diamond prices high. A recent UN report into the failure of the sanctions imposed to stop the trading of stones from Angola lists a score of men such as Victor Bout, a Russian former KGB agent who runs an airfreight service out of Dubai, and the De Decker brothers, two South African businessmen alleged to have funnelled weapons into - and gems out of - half the countries along the continent's west coast. Another key figure named is a Dutch national called Jacobus Witteveen. According to the researchers he has procured arms for Unita and owns his own Antwerp-based diamond firm. The Observer has also learnt that at least two British-based companies are involved in the trade, and that a number of mercenary organisations with UK links have been drawn into the shadowy world of smuggled diamonds.

'Even the Cold War superpowers did not allow the wholesale ripping up of the economy, the use of children as soldiers and attacks on relief groups,' says Herbert Rowe, political scientist and Africa specialist at Georgetown University in Washington. As for Sierra Leone, the UN report blames diamonds for 'destabilising the country for the better part of three decades, stealing its patrimony and robbing an entire generation of children, putting the country dead last in the UN's human development index'. The key to the whole system that drives the diamond wars is found, however, not in a stinking bush war bunker but in one of Europe's most well-heeled cities. Two thirds of the world's diamond trade is dealt through the Belgian port of Antwerp. It is there that, campaigners allege, the blood-stained stones from African conflicts are laundered clean and sent out to be worn on the fingers of lovers around the world.

Figures released last week forecast that the country's drug death toll this year is expected to top 300 for the first time. Before the new outbreak, 36 addicts had already died in the Strathclyde area alone, which includes Glasgow.</p> <p>Fears are growing that the outbreak will spread beyond Glasgow and even Strathclyde. Grampian police revealed yesterday that its officers are investigating the death on 1 May of a heroin-user in the light of the crisis in Glasgow.</p> <p>But this weekend heroin users across the city are confronting the same reality as Leanne. As the death toll has mounted in what one government adviser has dubbed a 'public health disaster', they have been forced to realise just how vulnerable they are to contaminated drugs and dangerous dealers. 'People with serious drug misuse problems don't believe they are going to die,' explained Andrew Horne, of Turning Point Scotland, the charity which runs a Glasgow drugs crisis centre. 'They know they might overdose at some point, but they have come so close so many times they think they can evade death.</p> <p>'Everybody has been shocked by this. It has made them realise they have no control over what they buy, who they buy from or what is in the heroin they buy.'</p> <p>It has been a costly lesson. The crisis began two weeks ago in the Victoria Infirmary in the south of the city. Two female heroin-users turned up at the casualty department with abscesses that appeared no different from the tissue infections common around the injecting area of drugs users. They were given the normal treatment of antibiotics, but the abscesses grew rapidly and their condition deteriorated fast as they developed a severe septi caemic-type illness.</p> <p>Despite receiving intensive medical treatment, they suffered multiple organ failure and were dead within hours. But it was not until last Tuesday, almost 10 days later, that health experts from the Greater Glasgow Health Board were certain enough that the outbreak was not isolated to go public. By then, 13 cases had emerged. Six of them were already dead - five of them women.</p> <p>'The problem for us was that there are so many drugs deaths in Glasgow it took some time to put everything together,' said Laurence Gruer, the health board's senior public health consultant. The cases were strikingly similar. All 13 were from Govanhill, a rundown area of tenement flats just south of city centre. All had injected straight into muscle tissue, mostly around the groin. All had developed horrendous abscesses before their condition deteriorated rapidly. One woman who survived had developed an abscess 12in by 8in in diameter. All had used citric acid to break down the heroin for injection, and most had got it from the same grocers' shop. Suspicion fell on the citric acid. Experts believed it may have been contaminated with a toxic substance which caused the infection.</p> <p>Women were more at risk because their veins are harder to find, making female users more likely to deliberately inject straight into muscle - known as skin-popping - or to accidentally miss a vein. On Tuesday afternoon, Dr Gruer outlined the theory at an emergency meeting to public health and medical experts, senior police officers, the procurator-fiscal and representatives of drugs services.</p> <p>'Everybody there had a lot of experience dealing with drugs users but none of us had come across anything like this before,' said Gruer. 'We didn't know whether it was the tip of the iceberg.'</p> <p>At a press conference afterwards, users were warned to avoid injecting into tissue and to seek immediate medical help if they developed abcesses or other signs of tissue infection.</p> <p>By Wednesday afternoon, however, the crisis was deepening. Six more cases had emerged, and two more women had died. But this time, they were from the north of the city, in the Sighthill and Possil areas where heroin use is rife. They had used citric acid but had bought different brands from different stores. Health officials were forced to turn their attention to the heroin.</p> <p>This weekend heroin samples, some taken from one sufferer and some bought on the street, have been sent to a specialist laboratory in London for analysis. Tests on tissue taken from sufferers has revealed evidence of bacteria but only of the sort normally found on the body.</p> <p>Experts are working on the theory that an unknown contaminant in the heroin reacts with these bacteria when injected directly into tissue.</p> <p>But there is also another, more sinister theory doing the rounds among Glasgow's heroin-users. 'People are starting to wondering whether it's some real nasty bastard, somebody right at the top of the supply tree who hates junkies and just wants to wipe them out,' said Derek, 39, who has been injecting heroin for 20 years and who says he will not be able to stop despite the new threat.</p> <p>Senior police officers are of the same opinion. Within 24 hours of the first warnings being announced, Strathclyde's chief constable had set up a special unit, under a senior detective, to investigate the outbreak. The unit has been equipped with the Holmes computer, the Home Office Major Enquiry System more commonly used in murder investigations.</p> <p>For those working with drugs users, the last week has provided another salutary lesson, said Andrew Horne. 'There have been so many warnings from some agencies in the past that users don't really take them seriously,' he explained. 'Warnings should only go out when we are certain of what we are warning about.'</p> <p>For the time being, warnings are all the heroin users have to go on. 'It is the not knowing that is the worst part,' said Leanne. 'Even if there are no more deaths, you will always be wondering whether this is going to come back again. The threat is always going to be there.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:stuart.millar@observer.co.uk\">stuart.millar@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Two female heroin-users turned up at the casualty department with abscesses that appeared no different from the tissue infections common around the injecting area of drugs users. They were given the normal treatment of antibiotics, but the abscesses grew rapidly and their condition deteriorated fast as they developed a severe septi caemic-type illness. Despite receiving intensive medical treatment, they suffered multiple organ failure and were dead within hours. But it was not until last Tuesday, almost 10 days later, that health experts from the Greater Glasgow Health Board were certain enough that the outbreak was not isolated to go public. By then, 13 cases had emerged. Six of them were already dead - five of them women. 'The problem for us was that there are so many drugs deaths in Glasgow it took some time to put everything together,' said Laurence Gruer, the health board's senior public health consultant. The cases were strikingly similar. All 13 were from Govanhill, a rundown area of tenement flats just south of city centre. All had injected straight into muscle tissue, mostly around the groin. All had developed horrendous abscesses before their condition deteriorated rapidly. One woman who survived had developed an abscess 12in by 8in in diameter. All had used citric acid to break down the heroin for injection, and most had got it from the same grocers' shop. Suspicion fell on the citric acid. Experts believed it may have been contaminated with a toxic substance which caused the infection. Women were more at risk because their veins are harder to find, making female users more likely to deliberately inject straight into muscle - known as skin-popping - or to accidentally miss a vein. On Tuesday afternoon, Dr Gruer outlined the theory at an emergency meeting to public health and medical experts, senior police officers, the procurator-fiscal and representatives of drugs services. 'Everybody there had a lot of experience dealing with drugs users but none of us had come across anything like this before,' said Gruer. 'We didn't know whether it was the tip of the iceberg.' At a press conference afterwards, users were warned to avoid injecting into tissue and to seek immediate medical help if they developed abcesses or other signs of tissue infection. By Wednesday afternoon, however, the crisis was deepening. Six more cases had emerged, and two more women had died. But this time, they were from the north of the city, in the Sighthill and Possil areas where heroin use is rife. They had used citric acid but had bought different brands from different stores. Health officials were forced to turn their attention to the heroin. This weekend heroin samples, some taken from one sufferer and some bought on the street, have been sent to a specialist laboratory in London for analysis. Tests on tissue taken from sufferers has revealed evidence of bacteria but only of the sort normally found on the body. Experts are working on the theory that an unknown contaminant in the heroin reacts with these bacteria when injected directly into tissue. But there is also another, more sinister theory doing the rounds among Glasgow's heroin-users. 'People are starting to wondering whether it's some real nasty bastard, somebody right at the top of the supply tree who hates junkies and just wants to wipe them out,' said Derek, 39, who has been injecting heroin for 20 years and who says he will not be able to stop despite the new threat. Senior police officers are of the same opinion. Within 24 hours of the first warnings being announced, Strathclyde's chief constable had set up a special unit, under a senior detective, to investigate the outbreak. The unit has been equipped with the Holmes computer, the Home Office Major Enquiry System more commonly used in murder investigations. For those working with drugs users, the last week has provided another salutary lesson, said Andrew Horne. 'There have been so many warnings from some agencies in the past that users don't really take them seriously,' he explained. 'Warnings should only go out when we are certain of what we are warning about.' For the time being, warnings are all the heroin users have to go on. 'It is the not knowing that is the worst part,' said Leanne. 'Even if there are no more deaths, you will always be wondering whether this is going to come back again. The threat is always going to be there.' stuart.millar@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Dramatic new evidence that faulty track could have caused the Paddington rail crash - by tripping a driver's warning system into falsely indicating a green signal - will be presented to the disaster inquiry, The Observer has learnt. Official tests on the warning system showed that, when jolted sharply with a force similar to the train passing over a piece of misaligned track, the electromagnetic receiver wrongly rang the 'all-clear' bell in the driver's cab. The laboratory test results so shocked the official technical experts at WS Atkins, which is advising the Cullen inquiry into the crash, that they will now carry out live tests using trains on the national rail network. Railtrack chief executive Gerald Corbett dismissed a report from the Health and Safety Executive in April that a misaligned piece of track could have shaken the Thames train so violently it caused the automatic warning system to malfunction. But the new tests show that this is a much more likely explanation than originally thought. Experts have been baffled about why 31-year-old Michael Hodder, the driver of the Thames Train heading from Paddington to Bedwyn, Wilts, on the day of the crash last October, mysteriously accelerated before he passed through the fateful red signal 109 and ploughed into a Great Western train bound for Paddington. He had coasted past a double-yellow and a yellow signal, indicating caution as there was a red signal ahead, but speeded up from 38mph to 51mph before crashing. The tests carried out by WS Atkins now make it more likely that the train bumped over the piece of faulty track near the Ladbroke Grove junction outside Paddington station and wrongly rang the bell in Hodder's cab, leading him to believe that signal 109, which was difficult to see clearly, was green. Magnets placed between the tracks near signals transmit messages into the AWS receiver on the bottom of trains, which then sound a bell or horn in the cab. Tests to establish whether a sharp jolt on the track could cause the wrong message to be transmitted have been carried out not only by WS Atkins but also by other technical experts hired by representatives of the survivors and bereaved. One source who is familiar with the tests said: 'We have called our expert to give evidence. He is going to demonstrate with the automatic warning system equipment that if you hit the receiver hard at the right moment it sounds a bell not a horn. 'It recreates the receiver on the bottom of the train being seriously jolted by misaligned track. It appears to be the only reason to explain why Hodder accelerated when he would normal coast when there was the expectation of a red signal up ahead.' There is also a question mark over whether the AWS receiver fitted to the Thames train was loose. The inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen into the rail disaster, in which 31 people died and 414 were injured, many very seriously, opened last week in London. Railtrack and Thames Trains came in for early criticism over their spending records, track maintenance procedures and driver training. Survivors of the crash will start appearing as witnesses tomorrow. joanna.walters@observer.co.uk",

He paid \u00a3750 in cash. The notes were crisp and new. The chopper flew up and away over the Irish Sea, leaving the effluent plume from the Mersey and the metal prick of the Blackpool Tower far below. The chopper flew north over the grey, scudding sea to the peninsula of Barrow-on-Furnace - where they turn out nuclear submarines for the Royal Navy. The Scouser pointed to a big square of grass down below, the grounds of the non-league Barrow Athletic Football Club, and said: 'I own that.' Some boast. But it turns out that he wasn't short of a bob or a hundred million pounds. </p> <p>The scally's name was Curtis Warren, his nickname Cocky Watchman, Scouse slang for a dodgy caretaker, and he was, some say, the Cali cartel's agent for northern Europe. Her Majesty's Customs and Excise had a different name for him: Target One. </p> <p>He's banged up now, serving a 12-year-stretch in Vught prison in the Netherlands, a former Nazi concentration camp, for importing enough cocaine into Europe to keep the London advertising industry happy until the year 2010. Cocky had a bit of a rumpus the other day in his Dutch prison. A Turkish prisoner attacked him, according to Cocky's solicitor. Cocky hit back with a couple of blows and killed him. Meanwhile, British Customs officers and policemen, working in tandem for a Dutch judge, are beginning to unpick a fraction of Cocky's missing millions. Forget Kenneth Noye. He was just a fence, albeit for the Brinks Matt gold bullion robbers, and one with a nasty temper. Forget the Krays. They were just pathetic minnows. </p> <p>Law enforcement on the track of Cocky's treasure have thus far uncovered some \u00a320m, though they have yet to get their hands on it. They suspect that he is worth a lot more. One Customs officer on his case suspects he might have \u00a3150m buried away. Another former associate has referred to a fortune worth \u00a3185m. </p> <p>Cocky, through his solicitor, says he has been fitted up by a 'wispa campaign' by Customs, that he only owns two very small properties in Liverpool and that reports of his 'multi-millionaire status' are grossly exaggerated. Well, maybe. </p> <p>It is nigh on certain that Cocky is the richest criminal in British history. Some of it is stashed in tax havens and Swiss banks, some of it placed in a beautiful flat in Liverpool's fancy Wapping Dock development, bang opposite the Customs museum, a small fraction on motors - normally a quietly unfussy Lexus, aircon as standard - some of it on office blocks, some on 200 properties in the north-west, mainly let out to DHS claimants. Not forgetting, they said, a mansion in the north-west, a villa in the Netherlands, a casino or two in Spain, a disco in Turkey. The interesting question is, where's all that money now. </p> <p>Cocky, with his Desperate Dan pecs, his head shaved as round and smooth as a billiard ball and his thick black eyebrows marching across his face like asylum-seeking millipedes, looks like the original children's TV arch villain - the evil 'Hood', the jerky-limbed puppet whose eyes backlit in Thunderbirds, trying but failing to throw a spanner in the works of International Rescue. The real Hood, however, was much more successful. </p> <p>The first thing to realise when trying to understand why Her Majesty's Government Drugs Czar Keith Hellawell is finding it so hopelessly difficult to enforce prohibition of hard drugs like cocaine and heroin is that the opposition Drug Czars are not stupid. Yes, many dealers are short-termers, pathetic, often violent 'scrotes' who eventually end up snorting or injecting too much of their own gear, and fall foul of the law, or the competition. But the good ones are different. Smart, streetwise, yes, but subtle too and, above all, intelligent and keen to use intelligence. And Cocky was very good indeed. The second thing is that smart operators like Cocky are only in it for the (huge amounts of) money. And the third, is that honest law enforcement is failing miserably in getting to and getting hold of the drug barons' money. The story of Curtis Warren is a study in society's abject failure to do just that. </p> <p> I remember vividly the first time I ever heard the name Curtis Warren. Veronica Guerin, the brilliant Irish journalist had been shot dead in Dublin in the summer of 1996, for going after the heroin barons who were making themselves rich while a generation of Irish kids were getting suckered on smack. Her mission had been simple: follow the money. The Observer sent me off to find out who, and why, and how. And what were the names of the British Mr Bigs? In Dublin, I saw a young mother, who was eight-and-a-half-months pregnant, inject herself with heroin because her craving for smack was more powerful than her love for her unborn child. The unborn baby was a junkie, too, quivering inside her stomach for the heroin. When it was born, the first thing that happened was that it was put on to baby methadone. It was one of those things you see with your own eyes, and cannot believe and never forget. </p> <p>In search of the British Mr Bigs, I had gone to a pub to meet a Customs investigator, the late Bill Newall, who at that time was working for the heroin target team. Bill had hollow legs, an ear for a good story well told and a nice line on the South-East Regional Crime Squad: 'The best police force money can buy'. Bill had 'called the knock' on many heavy-duty nasties, including a number of Turkish heroin traffickers, and on some more amusing outlaws, including a judge he had nicked for smuggling scotch in his yacht. I asked Bill about the Mr Bigs, the ones that always get away. He took a pull on his pint and said: 'Then you've got to go to Liverpool. And ask them about Curtis Warren.' </p> <p>Who? </p> <p>'He's nothing much to look at. The usual big Scouse tough guy in a shellsuit. But this one is good. He doesn't drink, smoke or use drugs. He's got a photographic memory for telephone numbers, numbers of bank accounts and the like. We've been looking for where he keeps his stuff. On a computer? In notes? No way. He carries it all inside his head.' </p> <p>Curtis Francis Warren was born at home on 31 May 1963, his father a mixed-race sailor with the Norwegian Merchant Navy, his grandfather listed as a coffee manufacturer in the Americas. His mother was Sylvia Chantre, the daughter of a shipyard boiler attendant and a mother with a Spanish name, Baptista, originally from Bird Island, South Africa. The young Warren was brought up in the Granby district of Toxteth, which wasn't then, and isn't now, the St Tropez of the north-west. It looks bomb-damaged, but then you recall that the Luftwaffe haven't been this way for more than half a century. The Toxteth riots in the 80s provided the coffin for the area's reputation. That, and the sad fact that insurance rates for the Toxteth postcodes are some of the highest in the country. </p> <p>Today you can see the 'scrotes' hanging out, on the look-out for coppers, Customs, strangers. The taxi driver who took me around offered the following advice: 'It's fine for you to walk around and chat to people. Just give me all your money first.' </p> <p>But from these lowly origins, Cocky became so rich he made it on to The Sunday Times Rich 500 list, the highest-placed mixed-race plutocrat in the country. The odd thing about all this wealth is that he had, as they say, no visible means of income. On the contrary, the word was Cocky had made the lion's share of this fabulous sum of money importing stupendous amounts of heroin and cocaine, guns and amphetamine tablets, the drugs direct from the Colombian narco-barons themselves. </p> <p>He had left school around the age of 11, and was picked up every now and then for bits and pieces of crime. The authors of his compelling biography, Cocky: The Rise and Fall of Curtis Warren, Britain's Biggest Drugs Baron (Milo Books, \u00a314.99), Tony Barnes, Richard Elias and Peter Walsh had no luck whatsoever in getting Cocky's family or schoolfriends or teachers in talking about his early years. Nor did The Observer. </p> <p>Liverpool cops say Cocky started out life on the doors as a bouncer, then he moved up a level and began organising bouncers. It's a truism that 'if you control the doors, you control the drugs'. While still in his teens, Cocky was selling heroin. And he started making friends. A fellow bouncer, Mike Ahearne, grew up to be Warrior, from the TV show Gladiators. Another pal was Johnny 'Sonny' Phillips, a black bouncer and a ferocious enforcer. A third was Stephen Mee, who later made a name for himself by leaving a prison van, without prior consent, in the middle of the Pennines. </p> <p>By the late 80s, Cocky had moved into the wrong kind of snow, big time. He teamed up with another drugs trafficker with style, Brian Charrington, who worked the north-east of England, to Cocky's north-west. Like Cocky, Charrington was enormously wealthy, but had no obvious means of wealth. Charrington had a yacht. Well, doesn't everyone? </p> <p>The two of them went to France on British visitor passports. Once in France, they took out their 10-year-passports and flew to Venezuela, which is next door to Colombia and awash with cocaine. There, the two men fixed up a deal to import huge amounts of coke in steel boxes sealed inside lead ingots, which were not so easy to slice open and impossible to X-ray. Customs were suspicious of the lead ingots. They had cut open one ingot in a first shipment of lead from South America, but had found nothing and let it through. Too late, Dutch cops tipped them off that the coke was hidden inside steel boxes inside the lead ingots. </p> <p>Customs stopped a second shipment and arrested Cocky and Charrington. They had them bang to rights. Oh no they hadn't. Charrington had been working as a police informer for two officers from the North-East Regional Crime Squad, DI Harry Knaggs and DS Ian Weedon. The question that troubled Customs was whether the intelligence the two policemen were getting from Charrington merited dropping a huge importation case against him. Who got the fat? And who got the lean? </p> <p>Customs ploughed on with their prosecution, but Knaggs and Weedon fought hard. They got in touch with a rare beastie, a Tory MP in the north-east, one Tim Devlin. He was the PPS to the Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell. And Devlin organised a meeting whereby Knaggs and Weedon made their representations for their informer to be let go. They won. Funnily enough, their Chief Constable was Keith Hellawell, now the government's drugs czar. </p> <p>The effect of Knaggs and Weedon championing of Charrington was to torpedo Customs' case. When Charrington walked, the case against Cocky at Newcastle Crown Court in 1992 fell through, too. Legend has it that Cocky went back to the ashen-faced Customs officers, gnashing their teeth at this reverse, and said: 'I'm off to spend my \u00a387m from the first shipment and you can't fucking touch me.' Cocky's Liverpool lawyer has denied this boast, but the legend is the better story. </p> <p>A few months later, Harry Knaggs was clocked by Customs at Dover driving a \u00a370,000 BMW into the country. The luxury German car was registered in the name of Brian Charrington. </p> <p>Time and Cocky moved on. Liverpool descended into a terrifying gang law. In May 1995, 11 people were shot in one month. None of the gangsters behind the shootings were brought to justice. One bouncer, Stephen Cole, was sitting in the Farmers Arms pub in Fazakerley, drinking with his wife, when a gang of machete-wielding thugs set about him. A normal autopsy takes an hour and a half. Cole's took seven hours. </p> <p> Cocky, ever cautious, moved to Holland. But not Amsterdam. He went to the lowly dorp of Sassenheim, where he set up shop in a fancy but not overly pretentious villa called Bakara. He hung a boxer's punchbag from the attic ceiling and checked out the world from four slits in the roof. North, east, south and west were covered. It's a substantial house with a big garden, but most of the rooms were empty. It was almost as if he was imprisoned by his own ill-gotten wealth. To kill time, he phoned his Merseyside mates on his mobile or 'portie', always keeping a sharp eye on the latest gossip. </p> <p>He didn't know it, but someone was listening in to his phone conversations. But being Cocky, he didn't make anything easy for law enforcement. No names, only nicknames. So, according to Cocky the biography, he chatted about the Werewolf and the Vampire, Cracker, Macker and Tacker, the Bell with no Stalk, the Egg on Legs, Lunty, Badger, Boo, Twit and Twat, Big Foot, the Big Fella, the J Fella, the L Fella and many more. </p> <p>Cocky's conversations were taped by the Dutch police and are known as the Dutch Product. The transcripts show that he was a subtle player of the gangster game, for example, gently admonishing the brother of a bouncer who was causing trouble. They provide an insight, too, into what was going through his mind. The odd thing is that, rich as he was, Cocky couldn't stop himself from shipping in more coke. Maybe it was the buzz. That must have meant more to him than the money. </p> <p>The new plan was a variation on the old coke-in-lead trick. But this time the coke was going not to Britain, but Bulgaria, where Cocky had interests in a winery. There, oxyacetylene torches would cut through the lead ingots, and the coke would be retrieved. It would then be cooked into liquid and - here's the clever bit - held in suspension inside bottles of Bulgarian red wine. The Plovdiv plonk with the kick of a Colombian mule was going to be shipped back across Europe to Liverpool, from where the coke would be liberated and sold at a 2,000 per cent mark-up to the nation's grateful coke addicts. Neat, huh? </p> <p>A container load of coke-in-lead arrived in Holland. And Cocky was fast asleep in his new Low Country home, when the Dutch version of the SAS moved in with stun grenades and the like and busted Cocky and his gang. </p> <p>The Dutch went hunting in six addresses. They found the container and got out a pneumatic drill and the long slog of drilling into the lead started - each ingot being about one metre cubed. Eventually the drill noise changed pitch, the metal filings became lighter and a fine white powder flecked the drill head. They drilled a hole big enough for an arm to reach in, and repeated the process. Hidden in the lead was 400 kilos of 90 per cent pure cocaine. At some of the other places the Dutch cops raided, they found 1,500k of cannabis resin, 60k of heroin, 50k of Ecstasy, crates stacked with 960 CS gas canisters, a bunch of hand grenades, three guns, ammo and almost \u00a3400,000 in guilders. The coke, the heroin, the dope, the E and the rest would have netted a cool \u00a3125m. Tax free. </p> <p>The Dutch judge gave him 12 years. That's much less than he would have got for major drug-trafficking in Britain. On the other hand, some law enforcement officers were concerned that friends of Cocky might do a little bit of jury-rigging: a live bullet through a letterbox here, a night with a stunning whore there, and then the threat of embarrassing phonecalls. Dreadful, really, to suggest it, but then Customs investigators have suspicious minds. </p> <p> So Cocky, the Liverpool Scally who had walked free of the law once before, was banged up at last. Customs, the Dutch and the police detectives from the North-West Regional Crime Squad who had worked with them on Operation Crayfish were delighted. </p> <p>Cocky was arrested four years ago. Since then, the anti-money-laundering units of the Netherlands and Britain have been working flat out to trace his ill-gotten gains. They heard about the chopper ride and Cocky's boasts that he owned Barrow Football Club's ground and started investigating. Police raided the club's offices and arrested Stephen Vaughan, a boxing promoter. Mr Vaughan's company, Northern Improvements, was the ground's major shareholder. Mr Vaughan wrote a letter to Boxing News in February 1998: 'I am sure you will be aware that I was recently arrested by HM Customs and Excise in relation to the investigation into Curtis Warren. You will be aware that the allegations centre on the laundering of millions of pounds of supposed drugs money. This is something I have categorically and strenuously denied and I cannot stress how vehemently any potential prosecution would be defended. </p> <p>'Unfortunately, the rumours and stories have reached us through the grapevine and I have heard some fantastic versions of events, most of which are untrue The investigation surrounds Curtis Warren's \"missing \u00a3185m\". Because I'm a past associate of Mr Warren, the HM Customs have deemed it necessary to investigate matters concerning me and some of my assets, such as the acquisition of an office block, a wine bar, Barrow Football Club's Holker Street Stadium, and to look into my land deals and residential building investments over the past six years. That is all.' </p> <p>Vaughan said after his arrest: 'Of course I know Warren,' he said. 'I used to employ his security company for my boxing promotions and paid him about 28 or 30 cheques for about \u00a3300 each. He once put \u00a317,500 into my solicitor's account to buy a council house I wanted to sell, but the deal never went through and I gave him his money back. I did buy a Toyota Land Cruiser from him.' Because of all the fuss, Vaughan later stepped down from the club. He has not been charged with any offence. </p> <p>Another line of inquiry has been the amazing herbaceous border of Philly Glennon Snr. The Liverpool businessmen is the father of Cocky's one-time girlfriend, Stephanie. Glennon Snr was described at the trial of bent cop Elly Davies by prosecution QC Peter Joyce as a 'wealthy crook who made his money through drugs' and, by Elly himself, as a 'major drugs baron'. Before Elly's trial, police investigating Glennon Snr found more than a \u00a31m underneath his nasturtiums. No charges were brought against him. Now he wants his money back. The police are holding on to it, for the moment. </p> <p>But the upshot of huge amounts of casework in tracing Cocky's money is that they unearthed a pitiful \u00a320m, small change. Remember, they've only traced this money, not turned it over to the Dutch or British taxpayers. And the rest? That's disappeared down a black hole. Dubai. Swiss banks. A plethora of dodgy accounts in Her Majesty's tax havens. </p> <p>One Customs investigator told The Observer : 'It's a pig's ear of a system. The law as it stands favours the drugs baron. We have to find the money first. Then we have to prove a drugs nexus, through the teeth of a battery of lawyers arguing procedure against us. What we need, desperately, is a Civil Forfeiture Act. They've got one in Ireland, after the murder of Veronica Guerin. A CFA would mean that if we found a huge amount of cash, then the owner would have to explain how he came by it lawfully. If he can't do that, the cash goes to the taxpayer. That way we would take much of the fun out of being a drugs baron. But, at the moment, we're wondering why we bother. Until we get a CFA, we know that society isn't serious about tackling hard drugs.' </p> <p>The statistics bear out the complaint. In the last available year, Customs identified assets of drug barons valued at \u00a318m. Amounts realised against confiscation orders were a mere \u00a34.9m, a pathetically small sum given the billions made from the drugs trade in Britain. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the attempts to find Cocky's money grind on. The message Drugs Czar Keith Hellawell wishes to put out is that drug crime doesn't pay. He should ask Cocky. Nicely.</p>",

He paid \u00a3750 in cash. The notes were crisp and new. The chopper flew up and away over the Irish Sea, leaving the effluent plume from the Mersey and the metal prick of the Blackpool Tower far below. The chopper flew north over the grey, scudding sea to the peninsula of Barrow-on-Furnace - where they turn out nuclear submarines for the Royal Navy.

It's a substantial house with a big garden, but most of the rooms were empty. It was almost as if he was imprisoned by his own ill-gotten wealth. To kill time, he phoned his Merseyside mates on his mobile or 'portie', always keeping a sharp eye on the latest gossip. He didn't know it, but someone was listening in to his phone conversations. But being Cocky, he didn't make anything easy for law enforcement. No names, only nicknames. So, according to Cocky the biography, he chatted about the Werewolf and the Vampire, Cracker, Macker and Tacker, the Bell with no Stalk, the Egg on Legs, Lunty, Badger, Boo, Twit and Twat, Big Foot, the Big Fella, the J Fella, the L Fella and many more. Cocky's conversations were taped by the Dutch police and are known as the Dutch Product. The transcripts show that he was a subtle player of the gangster game, for example, gently admonishing the brother of a bouncer who was causing trouble. They provide an insight, too, into what was going through his mind. The odd thing is that, rich as he was, Cocky couldn't stop himself from shipping in more coke. Maybe it was the buzz. That must have meant more to him than the money. The new plan was a variation on the old coke-in-lead trick. But this time the coke was going not to Britain, but Bulgaria, where Cocky had interests in a winery. There, oxyacetylene torches would cut through the lead ingots, and the coke would be retrieved. It would then be cooked into liquid and - here's the clever bit - held in suspension inside bottles of Bulgarian red wine. The Plovdiv plonk with the kick of a Colombian mule was going to be shipped back across Europe to Liverpool, from where the coke would be liberated and sold at a 2,000 per cent mark-up to the nation's grateful coke addicts. Neat, huh? A container load of coke-in-lead arrived in Holland. And Cocky was fast asleep in his new Low Country home, when the Dutch version of the SAS moved in with stun grenades and the like and busted Cocky and his gang. The Dutch went hunting in six addresses. They found the container and got out a pneumatic drill and the long slog of drilling into the lead started - each ingot being about one metre cubed. Eventually the drill noise changed pitch, the metal filings became lighter and a fine white powder flecked the drill head. They drilled a hole big enough for an arm to reach in, and repeated the process. Hidden in the lead was 400 kilos of 90 per cent pure cocaine. At some of the other places the Dutch cops raided, they found 1,500k of cannabis resin, 60k of heroin, 50k of Ecstasy, crates stacked with 960 CS gas canisters, a bunch of hand grenades, three guns, ammo and almost \u00a3400,000 in guilders. The coke, the heroin, the dope, the E and the rest would have netted a cool \u00a3125m. Tax free. The Dutch judge gave him 12 years. That's much less than he would have got for major drug-trafficking in Britain. On the other hand, some law enforcement officers were concerned that friends of Cocky might do a little bit of jury-rigging: a live bullet through a letterbox here, a night with a stunning whore there, and then the threat of embarrassing phonecalls. Dreadful, really, to suggest it, but then Customs investigators have suspicious minds. So Cocky, the Liverpool Scally who had walked free of the law once before, was banged up at last. Customs, the Dutch and the police detectives from the North-West Regional Crime Squad who had worked with them on Operation Crayfish were delighted. Cocky was arrested four years ago. Since then, the anti-money-laundering units of the Netherlands and Britain have been working flat out to trace his ill-gotten gains. They heard about the chopper ride and Cocky's boasts that he owned Barrow Football Club's ground and started investigating. Police raided the club's offices and arrested Stephen Vaughan, a boxing promoter. Mr Vaughan's company, Northern Improvements, was the ground's major shareholder. Mr Vaughan wrote a letter to Boxing News in February 1998: 'I am sure you will be aware that I was recently arrested by HM Customs and Excise in relation to the investigation into Curtis Warren. You will be aware that the allegations centre on the laundering of millions of pounds of supposed drugs money. This is something I have categorically and strenuously denied and I cannot stress how vehemently any potential prosecution would be defended. 'Unfortunately, the rumours and stories have reached us through the grapevine and I have heard some fantastic versions of events, most of which are untrue The investigation surrounds Curtis Warren's \"missing \u00a3185m\". Because I'm a past associate of Mr Warren, the HM Customs have deemed it necessary to investigate matters concerning me and some of my assets, such as the acquisition of an office block, a wine bar, Barrow Football Club's Holker Street Stadium, and to look into my land deals and residential building investments over the past six years. That is all.' Vaughan said after his arrest: 'Of course I know Warren,' he said. 'I used to employ his security company for my boxing promotions and paid him about 28 or 30 cheques for about \u00a3300 each. He once put \u00a317,500 into my solicitor's account to buy a council house I wanted to sell, but the deal never went through and I gave him his money back. I did buy a Toyota Land Cruiser from him.' Because of all the fuss, Vaughan later stepped down from the club. He has not been charged with any offence. Another line of inquiry has been the amazing herbaceous border of Philly Glennon Snr. The Liverpool businessmen is the father of Cocky's one-time girlfriend, Stephanie. Glennon Snr was described at the trial of bent cop Elly Davies by prosecution QC Peter Joyce as a 'wealthy crook who made his money through drugs' and, by Elly himself, as a 'major drugs baron'. Before Elly's trial, police investigating Glennon Snr found more than a \u00a31m underneath his nasturtiums. No charges were brought against him. Now he wants his money back. The police are holding on to it, for the moment. But the upshot of huge amounts of casework in tracing Cocky's money is that they unearthed a pitiful \u00a320m, small change. Remember, they've only traced this money, not turned it over to the Dutch or British taxpayers. And the rest? That's disappeared down a black hole. Dubai. Swiss banks. A plethora of dodgy accounts in Her Majesty's tax havens. One Customs investigator told The Observer : 'It's a pig's ear of a system. The law as it stands favours the drugs baron. We have to find the money first. Then we have to prove a drugs nexus, through the teeth of a battery of lawyers arguing procedure against us. What we need, desperately, is a Civil Forfeiture Act. They've got one in Ireland, after the murder of Veronica Guerin. A CFA would mean that if we found a huge amount of cash, then the owner would have to explain how he came by it lawfully. If he can't do that, the cash goes to the taxpayer. That way we would take much of the fun out of being a drugs baron. But, at the moment, we're wondering why we bother. Until we get a CFA, we know that society isn't serious about tackling hard drugs.' The statistics bear out the complaint. In the last available year, Customs identified assets of drug barons valued at \u00a318m. Amounts realised against confiscation orders were a mere \u00a34.9m, a pathetically small sum given the billions made from the drugs trade in Britain. Meanwhile, the attempts to find Cocky's money grind on. The message Drugs Czar Keith Hellawell wishes to put out is that drug crime doesn't pay. He should ask Cocky. Nicely.",

      "body": "<p>My grandfather died before I was born, while still a relatively young man, of a heart attack, in his bed. My grandmother woke up, leaned over to offer tea, and there he lay, dead. Then again, she always maintained that the boy she married never returned from Dunkirk. Her dashing Jack The Lad came back from war a ghost of his former self. His hands shook, his nerves were shot. My mother remembers an extreme gentleness, and a morbid fear of loud noises - balloons were banned at birthday parties. In all, the war killed his friends, broke his spirit, and probably shortened his life by years if not decades. I think that merits a poppy or two, don't you? </p> <p>Paper flowers and sentimental news coverage once a year, don't add up to much, but they could be more than future generations could hope for. You'd have to be insane, or a politician chasing votes, not to hate and fear war. However, the fact remains that organised bloodshed seems to dignify an era like nothing else. Had my grandparents lived, they might have been surprised to find themselves part of what is, in effect, the last generation of credible pensioners - the final wave of old people that society can be half-bothered to care about and honour. My grandparents might also have been enraged by all the hypocrisy. We might ignore and despise the elderly as a matter of course - raising their pensions in insulting pennies, letting them freeze to death in winter, and scribbling 'Do Not Resuscitate' on their medical notes - but that doesn't mean we don't enjoy a good blub on Remembrance Sunday. </p> <p>You could see all this in the reaction to the May Day protests. The anger at the images of the graffiti-daubed Cenotaph. The disgust at the vision of the statue of Winston Churchill with a turf mohawk. Student beer is a terrible thing, to be sure, but there didn't seem to be much lasting harm done. Personally, I couldn't help laughing at the mohawk prank. The Cenotaph, though, was a different matter - but what do you expect from toff teenage anarchists, doubtless descended from breadroll-throwing 80s Hoorays? Even the former soldier who defaced the Churchill statue was keen to distance himself from the vandalism at the Cenotaph. It's one thing to dribble red paint over wartime premiers, quite another to mess with the Unknown Soldier, who was doubtless an alright geezer even an anti-capitalist could quite imagine sharing a pint with. </p> <p>We seem to get choked up about our Blitz-elderly the same way we get teary eyed about the 1966 World Cup win. Scanning the media, what happened on May Day was variously: 'A disgrace to the memory of those who died for their country'; 'An affront to a generation who fought for democracy'; 'A shameful indictment of our changing times'. This present generation of war-literate pensioners obviously represents something special, historic, and romantic to the public. Usually, old people matter so little, politicians are too busy chasing the sexy 'yoof vote' to bother to suck up to them. This situation only seems to change when there's a righteously patriotic editorial or photo opportunity to be had. Then, old soldiers and dears are wheeled out to shake their heads sorrowfully for the benefit of the cameras, before being spirited away to be ignored until next time they are needed. </p> <p>All of which makes you wonder what will happen when these conveniently 'credible' pensioners die off. Who and what will symbolise good, decent Great Britain then? For, whichever way you look at it, the media is going to have a hard time talking up the post-war decades. The 60s? 'They suffered so that we could have Mary Quant'. The 80s? 'They lived through Negative Equity'. The 90s? 'The Unknown Bridget Jones'. It doesn't quite work, does it? </p> <p>It would seem that without a World War to lend dignity, gravitas, and a sense of community, any generation is doomed to be remembered as fractured, pointless, even unsexy. Men seem to feel this keenly. It certainly says something that every boyfriend I've ever had has been obsessed by one fragment of wartime history or another. You name it, I've sat with a beau watching a documentary about it. Or more to the point, sat watching him watching it. </p> <p>Maybe this is what Jeremy Paxman, and all those other alpha media males, were really talking about not so long ago when they bemoaned the fact that a war had never come along to test their mettle.

      "bodyText": "My grandfather died before I was born, while still a relatively young man, of a heart attack, in his bed. My grandmother woke up, leaned over to offer tea, and there he lay, dead. Then again, she always maintained that the boy she married never returned from Dunkirk. Her dashing Jack The Lad came back from war a ghost of his former self. His hands shook, his nerves were shot. My mother remembers an extreme gentleness, and a morbid fear of loud noises - balloons were banned at birthday parties. In all, the war killed his friends, broke his spirit, and probably shortened his life by years if not decades. I think that merits a poppy or two, don't you? Paper flowers and sentimental news coverage once a year, don't add up to much, but they could be more than future generations could hope for. You'd have to be insane, or a politician chasing votes, not to hate and fear war. However, the fact remains that organised bloodshed seems to dignify an era like nothing else. Had my grandparents lived, they might have been surprised to find themselves part of what is, in effect, the last generation of credible pensioners - the final wave of old people that society can be half-bothered to care about and honour. My grandparents might also have been enraged by all the hypocrisy. We might ignore and despise the elderly as a matter of course - raising their pensions in insulting pennies, letting them freeze to death in winter, and scribbling 'Do Not Resuscitate' on their medical notes - but that doesn't mean we don't enjoy a good blub on Remembrance Sunday. You could see all this in the reaction to the May Day protests. The anger at the images of the graffiti-daubed Cenotaph. The disgust at the vision of the statue of Winston Churchill with a turf mohawk. Student beer is a terrible thing, to be sure, but there didn't seem to be much lasting harm done. Personally, I couldn't help laughing at the mohawk prank. The Cenotaph, though, was a different matter - but what do you expect from toff teenage anarchists, doubtless descended from breadroll-throwing 80s Hoorays? Even the former soldier who defaced the Churchill statue was keen to distance himself from the vandalism at the Cenotaph. It's one thing to dribble red paint over wartime premiers, quite another to mess with the Unknown Soldier, who was doubtless an alright geezer even an anti-capitalist could quite imagine sharing a pint with. We seem to get choked up about our Blitz-elderly the same way we get teary eyed about the 1966 World Cup win. Scanning the media, what happened on May Day was variously: 'A disgrace to the memory of those who died for their country'; 'An affront to a generation who fought for democracy'; 'A shameful indictment of our changing times'. This present generation of war-literate pensioners obviously represents something special, historic, and romantic to the public. Usually, old people matter so little, politicians are too busy chasing the sexy 'yoof vote' to bother to suck up to them. This situation only seems to change when there's a righteously patriotic editorial or photo opportunity to be had. Then, old soldiers and dears are wheeled out to shake their heads sorrowfully for the benefit of the cameras, before being spirited away to be ignored until next time they are needed. All of which makes you wonder what will happen when these conveniently 'credible' pensioners die off. Who and what will symbolise good, decent Great Britain then? For, whichever way you look at it, the media is going to have a hard time talking up the post-war decades. The 60s? 'They suffered so that we could have Mary Quant'. The 80s? 'They lived through Negative Equity'. The 90s? 'The Unknown Bridget Jones'. It doesn't quite work, does it? It would seem that without a World War to lend dignity, gravitas, and a sense of community, any generation is doomed to be remembered as fractured, pointless, even unsexy. Men seem to feel this keenly. It certainly says something that every boyfriend I've ever had has been obsessed by one fragment of wartime history or another. You name it, I've sat with a beau watching a documentary about it. Or more to the point, sat watching him watching it. Maybe this is what Jeremy Paxman, and all those other alpha media males, were really talking about not so long ago when they bemoaned the fact that a war had never come along to test their mettle. There we were thinking they were sulking because they'd never got the chance to handle anything more dangerous than an outside broadcast, but maybe they sincerely felt that their generation had been cheated out of a sense of history. Compared to our wartime old, the generations of pensioners to come promise to have no credibility whatsoever, and will probably be written off by the young and strong as a bunch of self-interested bums not worth the Zimmers they're stumbling around on. It's scary enough to grow old, scarier still to grow old without generational credibility. \u0095 barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>If new Rover is to succeed, it will need better management than it has ever had. That should not be difficult - the German episode is just the culmination of an unbroken sequence of management failures since the Fifties. </p> <p>But, in another sense, it's a tall order. The external conditions in which the company operates have never been tougher, and the stakes are rising all the time. 'It's on life support now,' says Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya, head of Warwick University's Warwick Manufacturing Group. </p> <p>But not all Rover's management problems are strictly of its own making. Some graphically illustrate the precarious position of manufacturing companies caught between indifferent governments and an unfriendly financial system. </p> <p>The Thatcher government's sale of Rover to BAe in 1988 was cynical. The aerospace company then sold the company on under the nose of its alliance partner Honda to an unsuspecting BMW, having neatly relieved it of some of its best Japanese-trained management talent. </p> <p>Now Rover faces more revolving doors, as UK personnel replace the existing BMW team. Despite the long-term record, recruitment is unlikely to be a problem, industry analysts believe. UK motor industry management in general has improved, thanks largely to the Japanese influence and outfits such as the Warwick Manufacturing Group. </p> <p>'My guess is that in the wave of euphoria it won't be hard to bring together some of the old team that was swept away by BMW,' says Professor Dan Jones, head of the Lean Enterprise Group at Cardiff Business School. 'Of course, the old group didn't disappear without reason; whether it is the right one now is a good question.' </p> <p>In the short term the Towers team does have a couple of things going for it, however. The first is unprecedented co-operation from the workforce - 'an extraordinary turnaround from the days of Red Robbo two decades ago,' notes Jones, who believes that the TGWU, and Tony Woodley in particular, deserve more credit for the Phoenix deal than they have yet received. </p> <p>The second plus is that, unlike BMW, the new management is under no illusion about how bad the situation really is. 'Managing is no problem if you have skilled managers, top-quality cars and the best modern plant,' says Bhattacharyya. 'When you're far from the best, you have to use a witches' brew and hope some of it will work. The problem for BMW at Rover was that it couldn't press A and get B. It couldn't manage chaos.' </p> <p>The issue for the incoming team is the reverse. It can probably handle the short-term ducking and diving - the big question is how it gets to the sunny uplands of a settled product and market strategy 18 months to two years on. </p> <p>The first of the immediate management priorities, say industry analysts, is to shift fields of unsold cars at almost any price - anything to get the cash coming in and prevent stocks from building up. </p> <p>There's no mystery about selling cars, Bhattacharyya says. There are no bad cars any more, but a lot of average ones. The lesson of Rover's doubled sales figures last month is that people will buy average vehicles - but not at a premium they no longer deserve. </p> <p>Rover's current sales drive improves morale and buys time, but is unsustainable in the long term because the cars are being sold below cost.

      "bodyText": "If new Rover is to succeed, it will need better management than it has ever had. That should not be difficult - the German episode is just the culmination of an unbroken sequence of management failures since the Fifties. But, in another sense, it's a tall order. The external conditions in which the company operates have never been tougher, and the stakes are rising all the time. 'It's on life support now,' says Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya, head of Warwick University's Warwick Manufacturing Group. But not all Rover's management problems are strictly of its own making. Some graphically illustrate the precarious position of manufacturing companies caught between indifferent governments and an unfriendly financial system. The Thatcher government's sale of Rover to BAe in 1988 was cynical. The aerospace company then sold the company on under the nose of its alliance partner Honda to an unsuspecting BMW, having neatly relieved it of some of its best Japanese-trained management talent. Now Rover faces more revolving doors, as UK personnel replace the existing BMW team. Despite the long-term record, recruitment is unlikely to be a problem, industry analysts believe. UK motor industry management in general has improved, thanks largely to the Japanese influence and outfits such as the Warwick Manufacturing Group. 'My guess is that in the wave of euphoria it won't be hard to bring together some of the old team that was swept away by BMW,' says Professor Dan Jones, head of the Lean Enterprise Group at Cardiff Business School. 'Of course, the old group didn't disappear without reason; whether it is the right one now is a good question.' In the short term the Towers team does have a couple of things going for it, however. The first is unprecedented co-operation from the workforce - 'an extraordinary turnaround from the days of Red Robbo two decades ago,' notes Jones, who believes that the TGWU, and Tony Woodley in particular, deserve more credit for the Phoenix deal than they have yet received. The second plus is that, unlike BMW, the new management is under no illusion about how bad the situation really is. 'Managing is no problem if you have skilled managers, top-quality cars and the best modern plant,' says Bhattacharyya. 'When you're far from the best, you have to use a witches' brew and hope some of it will work. The problem for BMW at Rover was that it couldn't press A and get B. It couldn't manage chaos.' The issue for the incoming team is the reverse. It can probably handle the short-term ducking and diving - the big question is how it gets to the sunny uplands of a settled product and market strategy 18 months to two years on. The first of the immediate management priorities, say industry analysts, is to shift fields of unsold cars at almost any price - anything to get the cash coming in and prevent stocks from building up. There's no mystery about selling cars, Bhattacharyya says. There are no bad cars any more, but a lot of average ones. The lesson of Rover's doubled sales figures last month is that people will buy average vehicles - but not at a premium they no longer deserve. Rover's current sales drive improves morale and buys time, but is unsustainable in the long term because the cars are being sold below cost. So the group's second priority is to cut out any remaining fat at Longbridge to lower the cost base and make itself more attractive to a stronger partner. Here, unfortunately, the company can exert little leverage, since overcapacity in the industry is endemic, and Jones says Longbridge is 'a hellhole - given the choice you wouldn't start from there'. Even Honda, which appears remarkably well disposed towards its former partner given the previous snub, will be no soft touch. It is a commercial organisation after all - and, while the UK company gained much-needed knowhow, it reportedly received little financial return from the previous collaboration. Assuming the deal is finally done - there remain plenty of details to finalise, warns Jones - perhaps Rover's biggest management challenge will be to prevent short-term survival measures such as cost-cutting and squeezing assets from sabotaging the medium-term need to invest in the brand. Most glaringly, BMW seemed as paralysed by Rover's brand shrinkage and halting product strategy as every other post-war management and, as it stands, Rover only has the resources to tweak the current range. 'The 75 is a bank manager's car,' says Jones. 'But there soon won't be any bank managers left - the Internet has seen to that.' So who is Rover to sell to? Resurrecting the Rover brand is vital; compared with this, streamlining Longbridge is child's play. If Phoenix can pull that off, it really will deserve its name.",

However, its refusal to give a complete clean bill of health to the technology has left lingering doubts. Are mobile phones completely safe or do they pose dangers, even on a limited scale? Stewart finds no persuasive evidence to support the latter notion, but refuses to support the former.</p> <p>The trouble lies not with Stewart's caution, but with some people's lust for certainty, an urge that science is simply not structured to assuage. Scientists draw inferences from available evidence and then expect their colleagues to try to disprove their ideas. Surviving notions are then temporarily accepted as working hypotheses. By contrast, pressure groups demand absolute assurances about the safety of food, phones and the environment, an expectation with unhappy consequences. During the BSE crisis, some researchers proclaimed beef was safe, statements that looked unfortunate with the first appearance of cases of new-variant CJD. Once burned, scientists then refused to give similar clearances to GM foods, a critical factor, it is said by some, in the disastrous public reception of this technology.</p> <p>One could argue just as easily that gene engineering was acceptable to the public when the technology was used to make medicines that helped the sick, but was rejected when employed in food and crop production - because it looked as if only farmers and big business would benefit. In other words, the public can assess the risks and benefits of a given science quite easily when it wants to. Indeed, it is arrogant to assume otherwise.</p> <p>Most people will therefore respond calmly to Stewart's report.

      "bodyText": "Last week's publication of the Stewart report on mobile-phone safety will have helped allay the public's worst fears over these devices. However, its refusal to give a complete clean bill of health to the technology has left lingering doubts. Are mobile phones completely safe or do they pose dangers, even on a limited scale? Stewart finds no persuasive evidence to support the latter notion, but refuses to support the former. The trouble lies not with Stewart's caution, but with some people's lust for certainty, an urge that science is simply not structured to assuage. Scientists draw inferences from available evidence and then expect their colleagues to try to disprove their ideas. Surviving notions are then temporarily accepted as working hypotheses. By contrast, pressure groups demand absolute assurances about the safety of food, phones and the environment, an expectation with unhappy consequences. During the BSE crisis, some researchers proclaimed beef was safe, statements that looked unfortunate with the first appearance of cases of new-variant CJD. Once burned, scientists then refused to give similar clearances to GM foods, a critical factor, it is said by some, in the disastrous public reception of this technology. One could argue just as easily that gene engineering was acceptable to the public when the technology was used to make medicines that helped the sick, but was rejected when employed in food and crop production - because it looked as if only farmers and big business would benefit. In other words, the public can assess the risks and benefits of a given science quite easily when it wants to. Indeed, it is arrogant to assume otherwise. Most people will therefore respond calmly to Stewart's report. Sales will not slump, though this will have more to do with our thirst to talk than with the public's powers to assess scientific pronouncements. We should not underestimate this latter ability, just the same.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Arsenal</strong></p> <p>Ian Trevett: Highbury High</p> <p>Whatever the result on Wednesday, the Uefa Cup saved our season. After the Wembley disasters in the Champions League, confidence was rock bottom and it cost us points. With only two goals Henry was no Anelka and with Vieira still suspended, Highbury was a gloomy place. The Uefa Cup brought back the fun and proved we could live with the best in Europe, especially the 5-1 thrashing of Spanish leaders Deportivo. Henry - the fanzine's player of the year - caught fire, Vieira added maturity to his game, and Tony Adams returned more dominant than ever. Next season we won't give United such a big start! </p> <p>Fun factor (marks out of 10): 6 (but 0 for the Champions League and 9 for the Uefa Cup).</p> <p><strong>Aston Villa</strong></p> <p>Dave Woodhall: Heroes and Villains</p> <p>A decent start, with results looking good even if performances weren't. A catastrophic run which left John Gregory a match away from the sack, even if the newly self-styled 'Delightful' Doug Ellis won't admit it. Then just one league defeat since early December and a place in the Cup Final. With a regular goalscorer this strangest of seasons could have ended with Champions League qualification. Instead, it's either FA Cup immortality or Intertoto mediocrity. Goerge Boateng added steel to midfield, Paul Merson was the best midfielder in the country post-Christmas. But for all-round consistency, my Player of the Year is David James.</p> <p>Fun factor (with the FA Cup): 10 (and if we lose at Wembley) 6 </p> <p><strong>Bradford City</strong></p> <p>John Watmough: City Gent</p> <p>It has been a roller-coaster. We knew at the start that we faced enormous difficulties to stay up. But if anyone had offered us a chance of staying up going into the last game of the season, most fans would have taken that last August. It's just a shame that things have swung around because two successive wins against Sunderland and Wimbledon meant our fate was in our own hands - last week's results took it away from us again. Liverpool today? Of course it's possible to beat them but we know how tough it will be. Goalkeeper Matt Clarke has been terrific as has young defender Andrew O'Brien and Dean Windass but my own Player of the Year choice would be David Wetherall, a great signing from Leeds. If we go down ,we all want to come back. </p> <p>Fun factor: 6</p> <p><strong>Chelsea</strong></p> <p>Mark Wheeler: Chelsea Independent </p> <p>Many Chelsea fans are unsure whether this has been a good season or not. We could give you a more definite answer after the FA Cup Final. Some feel that fifth in the league is disappointing after finishing third last season, but in reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League (at the first attempt) Chelsea have broken new ground. League performances against the relegation fodder have been infuriating but the 5-0 triumph over Manchester United was splendid compensation. Albert Ferrer and Gustavo Poyet have been superb but top man this season is undoubtedly Dennis Wise. </p> <p>Fun factor: 8 (rising to 9 if we win the FA Cup).</p> <p><strong>Coventry City</strong></p> <p>Paul Wheeler: Peeping Tom</p> <p>At times it has seemed as though Gordon Strachan was building and stocking his own ark as he only seems interested in collecting pairs of players. We have two Moroccans, two from Peru, a brace of Scottish internationals, we had two Swedes, and he even signed up two of his sons , and a couple of pensioners. It was a tale of two seasons on the pitch. At home we were Champions League contenders; away, relegation certainties. Only Watford can stop us achieving a whole season without an away win. The new arrivals made an immediate impact, none more so than Robbie Keane who exploded on the scene with a rush of goals, and Hadji and Chippo brought a touch of Moroccan gold on and off the pitch. Perhaps the greatest honours should go to Steve Ogrizovich who retired after his 601st appearance. Because of him we are still in a position to attract the international stars. </p> <p>Fun factor : Home 9, Away 1.</p> <p><strong>Derby County</strong> </p> <p>William Wilkinson: Ramsnet</p> <p>A season which began with manager Smith stating he had his 'strongest squad ever' finished with relief as we narrowly escaped relegation. Smith was right, the squad was strong, but through no fault of his own it had been left to go stagnant across the summer. The perennial underachievers were out in force with Lars Bohinen, Mikkel Beck, Dean Sturridge and Deon Burton being the main culprits. Player of the season Mart Poom was a rock throughout and captain Darryl Powell along with Craig Burley and Georgi Kinkladze stood out. The performance against Bradford away was inspirational and the emergence of Christie leaves hope for next season. Fresh blood and a new drive will see us come good next term. Who knows, maybe we'll have Furetes fully equipped with a passport by then</p> <p>Fun Factor: 5</p> <p><strong>Everton</strong></p> <p>Mark Staniford: Speke from the Harbour</p> <p>It's a sad reflection of the current state of the club when being safe from relegation six weeks before the end of season is seen as progress. However what should not be overlooked is the increase in the quality of the football that we have seen this season. Eyebrows were raised at the recruitment of Richard Gough, Mark Pembridge and Joe-Max Moore but not one of them have let the Blues down. Admittedly we would like to be looking at higher calibre players but the money is just not there. Bargain buy of the season was Stephen Hughes from Arsenal and Player of the Year, Richard Gough. </p> <p>Fun factor: 7 </p> <p><strong>Leeds United</strong></p> <p>Eric Carlile: Leeds United Supporters' Club</p> <p>A successful season with the side again qualifying for Europe and reaching the Uefa Cup semi-finals. Several players were introduced and their experience gained this time will make us even stronger in the future. David O'Leary, in his first full season as manager, did a great job and will surely strengthen the side for next season while full houses at most home games demonstrate the fans' faith in the side. Harry Kewell is our player of the year and we're looking forward to even more success next term when hopefully we win at least one trophy. Fun? With respect we must take the Turkish tragedy completely out of talk about fun but it has been, otherwise, an enjoyable campaign. </p> <p>Fun factor: 8.</p> <p><strong>Leicester City</strong></p> <p>Gary Silk: The Fox</p> <p>Another season of ridiculous over-achievement. When you think about how much we've spent - or not spent - it's remarkable. \u00a33 million for Darren Eadie was a huge deal for us. We also had a real midwinter injury crisis and then, even when Heskey went, we won at Southampton, Liverpool and Newcastle to show that Leicester still hard fire in their bellies when others were coasting towards summer. We go into the last weekend eighth in the table and that is fantastic for a club of our size. Then there is the matter of winning the League Cup and qualifying for Europe and all the while there was more politics off the field than you can shake a stick at. We were more confident of holding on to Martin O'Neill than last season when Leeds were after him. Heroes? I'd look no further than Matt Elliott and Gerry Taggart. Elliott, as a makeshift striker, was amazing - our player of the year. Losing Heskey was disappointing but Collymore is a more skilful replacement. </p> <p>Fun factor: 10.</p> <p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p> <p>John Pearman: Red All Over</p> <p>Like many Liverpool fans, if someone had told me at the start of the season that come the last day we would have a chance of finishing third, I would have taken it. We've achieved a lot despite having enough injuries to fill a couple of episodes of Casualty and we've seen some memorable goals and shared some memorable moments. The goals that Paddy Berger has scored should have ensured that MOTD gave him his own goal of the season competition. The premier signing of the season must surely be Sami Hyypia. But for the Koppites the man of the season has been G\u008erard Houllier who, along with Phil Thompson, has given Liverpool fans hope for the future and have given us back our pride\u00c9 at times the Kop sounded like it used to in days of yore.</p> <p>Fun Factor: 9. </p> <p><strong>Manchester United</strong></p> <p>Andy Mitten: United We Stand</p> <p>1999/2000 in a nutshell: another great season of fine attacking football only tempered by not defending the FA Cup and the defeat by Real Madrid. Red-shirted heroes: Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Jaap Stam, David Beckham - our world-class quartet. Could do better: Mickael Silvestre - rarely has a player made the difficult stuff look easy and, unfortunately, vice versa - like this one. Player of the year - Keane for another absolutely massive contribution to the United cause. 'We won the league in second gear,' sing Old Trafford's red hordes nonchalantly, but nothing can ever compare with last season's Treble. </p> <p>Fun Factor: 8</p> <p><strong>Middlesbrough</strong></p> <p>Robert Nichols: Fly Me To The Moon </p> <p>It's been a disappointing season for Boro fans. There is no disguising the fact. We made such a great start with new signings Paul Ince and Christian Ziege - real revelations and providing the inspiration for early away victories. Expectations were high but then the slump set in and we went crashing down the league and out of the cups to lower league opposition. Fortunately we dug in, regrouped and fought back with real spirit. And with a reported \u00a320 million to spend Boro fans will be hoping for a return to more entertaining times. Player of the year - Paul Ince, and I must mention young player of the year Andy Campbell, a super home-grown striker. It has been a bit of a slog so\u00c9</p> <p>Fun factor: 4.</p> <p> <strong>Newcastle United</strong></p> <p>Mark Jensen: The Mag</p> <p>Sunderland fans are crowing now but, from the day Bobby Robson took over, we enjoyed top-six form, made and FA Cup semi-final and enjoyed a mini-run in Europe, so it was not a terrible season. Even under Ruud Gullit I thought we had decent players without being world beaters, but Robson really turned things around. Off the field, the club can take no credit at all with the dispute over the stadium and fans' seating arrangements. Chief executive Freddie Fletcher was perhaps going to be leaving the post anyway, but his part in that fiasco ensured he was helped on his way. Robert Lee, Gary Speed and Alan Shearer would be the pick of the players for me - with Shearer the player of the year. He's simply the best all-round forward of all and has found great form under Robson. Under Gullit? Who do you believe? Gullit deserves to take most of the blame, but Shearer wasn't blameless and I did not like his attitude then - not when the fans who pay his wages could see, in my opinion, that he wasn't leading from the front. </p> <p>Fun factor : First six weeks 0; rest of season 7</p> <p><strong>Sheffield Wednesday</strong></p> <p>Dan Hammond: Spitting Feathers</p> <p>Thank God it's over! We have known for some time that we were going down, after all you surely can't lose 8-0 to a team one place above you and expect to stay up, can you? Such results as that one at St James's Park defined our season really, easily dealt with by teams who aren't really that good, we somehow managed to give the better teams a run for their money. All in all the team let us down through a lack of effort and desire. We know they should have performed better and I dare say they do too. The difference is we care\u00c9 they don't. In a season where the British versus foreigner argument has raged it is perhaps telling that players such as Alan Quinn and Steve Haslam have been our shining lights, whilst De Bilde and Co have been dire. The season has provided no enjoyment whatsoever for Owls fans but at least our young British players offer hope for the future.</p> <p>Fun factor: 0.</p> <p> <strong>Southampton</strong></p> <p>Keith Legg: Webmaster, Saintsforever.com</p> <p>As always with Saints, this season has been very eventful. However, more off the pitch than on it with Dave Jones being replaced by Glenn Hoddle in unique circumstances. Hoddle accomplished his main objective of keeping Saints in the top flight with five games to spare. It's hoped he will now take Saints the next step up the Premier League. Two players have really excelled this season, Dean Richards and MarianPahars. Deano has to the bargain of the season and it's crucial we keep him. Same goes for Pahars, who is an awesome finisher. With work about to start on Saints new 32,500 seat stadium, the season has finished on a high. </p> <p>Fun factor: 6</p> <p><strong>Sunderland</strong></p> <p>Martin McFadden: A Love Supreme</p> <p>We have to be happy with our final league position. We had a great start... beating Newcastle at St James's Park. The downside was that awful three-month spell when we did not win. Also, in past seasons we got used to free-flowing football, but once the reality of the Premiership hit home, we went into our shells. There was no really creative midfielder - and if we'd had one, what use would he have been? In the past we mixed up the long ball to Niall Quinn with movement through midfield, now it was all the long stuff. Journalists won't say this, but Sunderland now out-Wimbledon Wimbledon. Creative players - Alan Johnson, Martin Smith, Nicky Summerbee, Michael Bridges, tend to fall out with Peter Reid and then disappear but there were plenty of bright spots. Beating Chelsea 4-1, Kevin Phillips and all those goals, Neil McCann and Chris Makin. Player of the year by a mile - Phillips, an absolute sensation. Reid? It's true fans tend to be very pro or anti but he's the best manager here in my lifetime. </p> <p>Fun factor: 7.</p> <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></p> <p>Dave Beaver: Cock-A-Doodle-Doo</p> <p>Frustrating. Last season ended so well with some silverware and the promise of more if we only got a couple of major signings. It never happened. We got Willem Korsten, but never saw him until a few games ago and even then he didn't look a world beater. It seemed every club in the division - even Bradford with Jorge Cadette - signed a striker. Not us. We're not knockers, we like to criticise constructively and the talk of George Graham being pilloried by fans just because he was a Gooner is wide of the mark - I thought he was a great appointment. Stephen Carr is my player of the year but as for the rest it was very\u00c9 bitty. And, yes, we do want David Ginola back in August. </p> <p>Fun factor: 5.</p> <p><strong>Watford</strong></p> <p>Ian Grant: Blind, Stupid and Desperate</p> <p>We should feel humbled. We blew loud raspberries when told that we'd have to spend money to stay up and were humiliated as punishment. We should be sorry. It doesn't feel like that, though. With Graham Taylor as adored as ever, fine youngsters with top-flight experience (Smith, Perpetuini and Ward, to name but three) and stronger finances, we've got plenty to celebrate. After a season of injury-plagued frustration, the crucial things remain intact - GT's long-term plans, the team's legendary spirit and the fans' defiant pride. We did it our way. No regrets. Fun </p> <p>Factor: 7</p> <p><strong>West Ham United</strong></p> <p>Tony Foulds: Ironworks Gazette</p> <p>Some excellent football but we should be disappointed not to qualify for Europe on the back of it. Pleased to see the continuation of the 'academy' with the arrival of Michael Carrick, Stephen Bywater, (Tony) Newton and - before them - Joe Cole. If we can produce three youngsters a season like that then we've got a chance to compete against the best. Youngsters aside, Paulo Di Canio was amazing and how on earth he was not listed for the PFA Player of the Year prize I do not know. Top players would have to be Frank Lampard, John Moncur, Trevor Sinclair and Di Canio - and Di Canio would be player of the year by a street. The downside would be the Aston Villa League Cup debacle and losing to Tranmere in the FA Cup. </p> <p>Fun Factor: Those Cup defeats were far from funny - 4.</p> <p><strong>Wimbledon</strong></p> <p>Xavier Wiggins: Hoof The Ball Up</p> <p>If we survive today then I think this will have been our best season in the Premiership. Why? Because we have forward thinking owners with money to back up their ambition. They have just got us a training ground that will be a tremendous facility and incredibly impressive. I think they will also get us a new stadium. On the field many of performances were rubbish but the good news is that players are coming through and I think that Terry Burton is the right man for the job. Performances have suffered through tactical confusion but - even if we are relegated - then we'll be dropping down 13 years after people said we would. I'd have settled for that! Player of the Year Trond Andersen and Neil Sullivan is again worthy of mention. </p> <p>Fun (it has been) factor: 8</p>",

Fun factor: 7 Leeds United Eric Carlile: Leeds United Supporters' Club A successful season with the side again qualifying for Europe and reaching the Uefa Cup semi-finals. Several players were introduced and their experience gained this time will make us even stronger in the future. David O'Leary, in his first full season as manager, did a great job and will surely strengthen the side for next season while full houses at most home games demonstrate the fans' faith in the side. Harry Kewell is our player of the year and we're looking forward to even more success next term when hopefully we win at least one trophy. Fun? With respect we must take the Turkish tragedy completely out of talk about fun but it has been, otherwise, an enjoyable campaign. Fun factor: 8. Leicester City Gary Silk: The Fox Another season of ridiculous over-achievement. When you think about how much we've spent - or not spent - it's remarkable. \u00a33 million for Darren Eadie was a huge deal for us. We also had a real midwinter injury crisis and then, even when Heskey went, we won at Southampton, Liverpool and Newcastle to show that Leicester still hard fire in their bellies when others were coasting towards summer. We go into the last weekend eighth in the table and that is fantastic for a club of our size. Then there is the matter of winning the League Cup and qualifying for Europe and all the while there was more politics off the field than you can shake a stick at. We were more confident of holding on to Martin O'Neill than last season when Leeds were after him. Heroes? I'd look no further than Matt Elliott and Gerry Taggart. Elliott, as a makeshift striker, was amazing - our player of the year. Losing Heskey was disappointing but Collymore is a more skilful replacement. Fun factor: 10. Liverpool John Pearman: Red All Over Like many Liverpool fans, if someone had told me at the start of the season that come the last day we would have a chance of finishing third, I would have taken it. We've achieved a lot despite having enough injuries to fill a couple of episodes of Casualty and we've seen some memorable goals and shared some memorable moments. The goals that Paddy Berger has scored should have ensured that MOTD gave him his own goal of the season competition. The premier signing of the season must surely be Sami Hyypia. But for the Koppites the man of the season has been G\u008erard Houllier who, along with Phil Thompson, has given Liverpool fans hope for the future and have given us back our pride\u00c9 at times the Kop sounded like it used to in days of yore. Fun Factor: 9. Manchester United Andy Mitten: United We Stand 1999/2000 in a nutshell: another great season of fine attacking football only tempered by not defending the FA Cup and the defeat by Real Madrid. Red-shirted heroes: Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Jaap Stam, David Beckham - our world-class quartet. Could do better: Mickael Silvestre - rarely has a player made the difficult stuff look easy and, unfortunately, vice versa - like this one. Player of the year - Keane for another absolutely massive contribution to the United cause. 'We won the league in second gear,' sing Old Trafford's red hordes nonchalantly, but nothing can ever compare with last season's Treble. Fun Factor: 8 Middlesbrough Robert Nichols: Fly Me To The Moon It's been a disappointing season for Boro fans. There is no disguising the fact. We made such a great start with new signings Paul Ince and Christian Ziege - real revelations and providing the inspiration for early away victories. Expectations were high but then the slump set in and we went crashing down the league and out of the cups to lower league opposition. Fortunately we dug in, regrouped and fought back with real spirit. And with a reported \u00a320 million to spend Boro fans will be hoping for a return to more entertaining times. Player of the year - Paul Ince, and I must mention young player of the year Andy Campbell, a super home-grown striker. It has been a bit of a slog so\u00c9 Fun factor: 4. Newcastle United Mark Jensen: The Mag Sunderland fans are crowing now but, from the day Bobby Robson took over, we enjoyed top-six form, made and FA Cup semi-final and enjoyed a mini-run in Europe, so it was not a terrible season. Even under Ruud Gullit I thought we had decent players without being world beaters, but Robson really turned things around. Off the field, the club can take no credit at all with the dispute over the stadium and fans' seating arrangements. Chief executive Freddie Fletcher was perhaps going to be leaving the post anyway, but his part in that fiasco ensured he was helped on his way. Robert Lee, Gary Speed and Alan Shearer would be the pick of the players for me - with Shearer the player of the year. He's simply the best all-round forward of all and has found great form under Robson. Under Gullit? Who do you believe? Gullit deserves to take most of the blame, but Shearer wasn't blameless and I did not like his attitude then - not when the fans who pay his wages could see, in my opinion, that he wasn't leading from the front. Fun factor : First six weeks 0; rest of season 7 Sheffield Wednesday Dan Hammond: Spitting Feathers Thank God it's over! We have known for some time that we were going down, after all you surely can't lose 8-0 to a team one place above you and expect to stay up, can you? Such results as that one at St James's Park defined our season really, easily dealt with by teams who aren't really that good, we somehow managed to give the better teams a run for their money. All in all the team let us down through a lack of effort and desire. We know they should have performed better and I dare say they do too. The difference is we care\u00c9 they don't. In a season where the British versus foreigner argument has raged it is perhaps telling that players such as Alan Quinn and Steve Haslam have been our shining lights, whilst De Bilde and Co have been dire. The season has provided no enjoyment whatsoever for Owls fans but at least our young British players offer hope for the future. Fun factor: 0. Southampton Keith Legg: Webmaster, Saintsforever.com As always with Saints, this season has been very eventful. However, more off the pitch than on it with Dave Jones being replaced by Glenn Hoddle in unique circumstances. Hoddle accomplished his main objective of keeping Saints in the top flight with five games to spare. It's hoped he will now take Saints the next step up the Premier League. Two players have really excelled this season, Dean Richards and MarianPahars. Deano has to the bargain of the season and it's crucial we keep him. Same goes for Pahars, who is an awesome finisher. With work about to start on Saints new 32,500 seat stadium, the season has finished on a high. Fun factor: 6 Sunderland Martin McFadden: A Love Supreme We have to be happy with our final league position. We had a great start... beating Newcastle at St James's Park. The downside was that awful three-month spell when we did not win. Also, in past seasons we got used to free-flowing football, but once the reality of the Premiership hit home, we went into our shells. There was no really creative midfielder - and if we'd had one, what use would he have been? In the past we mixed up the long ball to Niall Quinn with movement through midfield, now it was all the long stuff. Journalists won't say this, but Sunderland now out-Wimbledon Wimbledon. Creative players - Alan Johnson, Martin Smith, Nicky Summerbee, Michael Bridges, tend to fall out with Peter Reid and then disappear but there were plenty of bright spots. Beating Chelsea 4-1, Kevin Phillips and all those goals, Neil McCann and Chris Makin. Player of the year by a mile - Phillips, an absolute sensation. Reid? It's true fans tend to be very pro or anti but he's the best manager here in my lifetime. Fun factor: 7. Tottenham Hotspur Dave Beaver: Cock-A-Doodle-Doo Frustrating. Last season ended so well with some silverware and the promise of more if we only got a couple of major signings. It never happened. We got Willem Korsten, but never saw him until a few games ago and even then he didn't look a world beater. It seemed every club in the division - even Bradford with Jorge Cadette - signed a striker. Not us. We're not knockers, we like to criticise constructively and the talk of George Graham being pilloried by fans just because he was a Gooner is wide of the mark - I thought he was a great appointment. Stephen Carr is my player of the year but as for the rest it was very\u00c9 bitty. And, yes, we do want David Ginola back in August. Fun factor: 5. Watford Ian Grant: Blind, Stupid and Desperate We should feel humbled. We blew loud raspberries when told that we'd have to spend money to stay up and were humiliated as punishment. We should be sorry. It doesn't feel like that, though. With Graham Taylor as adored as ever, fine youngsters with top-flight experience (Smith, Perpetuini and Ward, to name but three) and stronger finances, we've got plenty to celebrate. After a season of injury-plagued frustration, the crucial things remain intact - GT's long-term plans, the team's legendary spirit and the fans' defiant pride. We did it our way. No regrets. Fun Factor: 7 West Ham United Tony Foulds: Ironworks Gazette Some excellent football but we should be disappointed not to qualify for Europe on the back of it. Pleased to see the continuation of the 'academy' with the arrival of Michael Carrick, Stephen Bywater, (Tony) Newton and - before them - Joe Cole. If we can produce three youngsters a season like that then we've got a chance to compete against the best. Youngsters aside, Paulo Di Canio was amazing and how on earth he was not listed for the PFA Player of the Year prize I do not know. Top players would have to be Frank Lampard, John Moncur, Trevor Sinclair and Di Canio - and Di Canio would be player of the year by a street. The downside would be the Aston Villa League Cup debacle and losing to Tranmere in the FA Cup. Fun Factor: Those Cup defeats were far from funny - 4. Wimbledon Xavier Wiggins: Hoof The Ball Up If we survive today then I think this will have been our best season in the Premiership. Why? Because we have forward thinking owners with money to back up their ambition. They have just got us a training ground that will be a tremendous facility and incredibly impressive. I think they will also get us a new stadium. On the field many of performances were rubbish but the good news is that players are coming through and I think that Terry Burton is the right man for the job. Performances have suffered through tactical confusion but - even if we are relegated - then we'll be dropping down 13 years after people said we would. I'd have settled for that! Player of the Year Trond Andersen and Neil Sullivan is again worthy of mention. Fun (it has been) factor: 8",

      "byline": "Will Buckley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At the age of 30, the time has come for Nick Knight to fulfil his potential. Yesterday he was given his first chance for two years to build on a Test career which started promisingly and then went awry. There was a time when Knight, an aggressive left-hand batsman and accomplished fielder, seemed predestined to be one of the chosen few selected for the Test team as a matter of course. Between July 1996 and February 1997 he played eight Tests in a row and averaged 34.07 before breaking a finger. Since then, just one Test against South Africa at Manchester, 11 and one, and then consigned to the periphery as a one-day specialist considered not good enough to make England's dismal World Cup team. </p> <p>'I'm hoping to get the call,' he said at a dank Hove on Thursday evening sitting in the players' common-room - lounge is too flash a word - and watching his team-mates lark around with a rugby ball while coach Bob Woolmer looked on. 'I was disappointed with the one-off Test against South Africa. If I get a chance I must make it count,' says Knight. </p> <p>The reason he has been offered it is a encouraging start to the season. 'The pleasing thing is that when you're not among the original contracted players you have to score as many as you can to get in,' he says. 'I've gone out and got a weight of runs. The double hundred [against Glamorgan] doesn't make a season but it was a good time to get it.' </p> <p>Despite being excluded from the contracted dozen, he believes in the concept: 'It's the way forward. It must be a good thing to get a team together so they can progress together. The aim, obviously, is to get into the dozen next time.' </p> <p>Being left out has been something of a constant during his career. He started at Essex but had an in-and-out time. 'It was difficult. You'd be in, out, back in and then out again. I was desperate to be involved but when Goochie came back from Test duty he would naturally come back in.' </p> <p>In 1995, Warwickshire offered more certainty. 'We saw a cricketer with a lot of potential,' says Dermot Reeve, the Warwickshire captain at the time. 'He picks the ball up early, he's a good athlete and a very good fielder. We thought he'd be a good acquisition for the team and he proved to be. Nick wasn't entirely happy at the time and felt he'd be a better cricketer with us.' </p> <p>In Knight's first season Warwickshire won three trophies, in his second two trophies and Knight was instrumental to their success. 'Since I started at Warwickshire I've averaged 50,' he says. 'That's not too bad. I like to think I've done my piece.' </p> <p>He carried over his Warwickshire form to the England one-day team. Opening the batting on his debut against Pakistan, he charged down the wicket at Wasim Akram during his first over. Over that weekend, he made two centuries. His swashbuckling style was suited to the times. The Sri Lankans had improvised the idea of pinch-hitting to take maximum advantage of the fielding restrictions in place during the first 15 overs. Knight was the only Englishman who could launch an innings the Jayasuriya way. By hurtling down the wicket and pummelling the ball over a fast bowler's head he not only gave his side momentum, but also irritated the hell out of big men used to seeing batsmen cower rather than charge. </p> <p>Only a year and a half ago David Lloyd, when asked how much Knight meant to the team, compared his absence to the Australians missing Steve Waugh or the Sri Lankans doing without Aravinda De Silva. Four months later, after a dodgy trip to Sharjah and a meagre start to the season, he was dropped from the side. England opted to open with Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain and were out of the tournament before Dave Stewart's World Cup single was in the shops. </p> <p>'It was a real low point,' says Knight. 'A massive disappointment. But ultimately you have to remember that you're a member of the squad. You can't mope around. If someone wants a drink or a few throw-downs then you do it.' </p> <p>The disappointments may have made him mentally stronger. He's certainly an improved batsman. 'I'm a better player now than when I joined Warwickshire. I'm a much more complete player. Experience has given me a better understanding of the game and lots of batsmen have improved after they've reached 30.' </p> <p>In the past, there has been a suspicion that Knight is vulnerable to the ball swinging into him, a flaw common to left-handers. But there is no evidence of this as he survives the final session up against spirited Sussex bowling led by Robin 'Tucker' Martin-Jenkins. It has to be said that an overcast Hove can have a deadening effect. There are few spectators present and over half of them are suddenly deprived of a view of proceedings when a barman, apropos of nothing, and without a word of warning slams down his aluminium shutter. Men holding pints stand and stare at sheet metal, it takes them a while to realise they might be missing the action. Welcome to Division Two. </p> <p>'It will be a big disappointment if we're still in Division Two next year,' says Knight. 'But I don't think there's much difference between the divi sions at the moment. People don't say he scored runs in Division Two so they don't count. In time the better sides will stay up and the best players will play against the best more regularly. With the best batsmen facing the best bowlers the rate of improvement will be much quicker.' </p> <p>He's a fan of the restructuring and the new pitches. 'Last season lots of games were lasting one and a half days, two days, two and a half days. This year seems better. Good pitches help me. As long as you have good, even bounce that's all you need.'</p> <p>I mention the 'C' word. Knight admits to being surprised at Cronje's behaviour. Behind us Bob Woolmer does an impersonation of a man looking flabbergasted while juggling too many balls in the air. </p> <p>Knight made his Test debut against the West Indies and didn't have the happiest of times. He was hit on the helmet by a full-toss from Courtney Walsh, hit on the head while fielding at short-leg and broke his finger. If he does well against Zimbabwe he will have the chance to exact his revenge. </p> <p><strong> Batting Test matches </strong> 12 </p> <p>Innings: 21 </p> <p>Runs: 585 </p> <p>Average: 27.85 </p> <p><strong> One-day Intls </strong> 53 </p> <p>Innings: 53 </p> <p>Runs: 1923 </p> <p>Average: 40.66</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Yorkshire v Hampshire</p>",
      "byline": "Vic Marks at Headingley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We came to Leeds to witness a tubby, gregarious Australian, much lauded in his own country, deftly asserting his superiority over workaday English county professionals - and we were not disappointed. But the Aussie in question was Darren Lehmann, not Shane Warne. </p> <p>Lehmann was a class above his English colleagues (though not his Scottish one - Gavin Hamilton was also superb) as he steered Yorkshire to a position of total dominance over a hapless Hampshire side. He hit a masterful 85 on a typically tricky Headingley pitch, playing very straight and very late. There was no brute force; just wonderful watchful placement, deflecting the good ones into the gaps, cracking the bad ones to the boundary. </p> <p>One or two of those bad ones were delivered by his compatriot Warne, who is currently confronted with one of the sternest tests of his cricketing career. Warne has found himself playing for a team that can't score runs (neither has he after three first-class visits to the crease); he's playing on pitches which make the trooper, Peter Hartley, a far more formidable proposition than the world's greatest leg-spinner, and bowling to a young keeper who has only been converted from an opening batsman because of an injury mini-crisis at Hampshire. </p> <p>Being Warne he's still competing furiously, still encouraging his new mates, but it must be a struggle. When playing for Australia, he has rarely had to bowl when the deficit is in excess of 200. He had to yesterday. The root of Hampshire's problems stems from the loss of confidence of their batsmen, though they are also handicapped by the continued absence of their other expensive winter acquisition, Alan Mullally. They were bowled out cheaply by Caddick on a flat pitch at Southampton last week; on Tuesday they were tumbled out for 69 in the B&amp;H at Cardiff, where the ball refuses to bounce above knee high.

He drove straight and through the covers as if this was a batsman's paradise; he even managed to uppercut Hartley for six to third man. The next ball was cracked square for four, which took him to his maiden first-class century. So much for the nervous nineties.

      "bodyText": "We came to Leeds to witness a tubby, gregarious Australian, much lauded in his own country, deftly asserting his superiority over workaday English county professionals - and we were not disappointed. But the Aussie in question was Darren Lehmann, not Shane Warne. Lehmann was a class above his English colleagues (though not his Scottish one - Gavin Hamilton was also superb) as he steered Yorkshire to a position of total dominance over a hapless Hampshire side. He hit a masterful 85 on a typically tricky Headingley pitch, playing very straight and very late. There was no brute force; just wonderful watchful placement, deflecting the good ones into the gaps, cracking the bad ones to the boundary. One or two of those bad ones were delivered by his compatriot Warne, who is currently confronted with one of the sternest tests of his cricketing career. Warne has found himself playing for a team that can't score runs (neither has he after three first-class visits to the crease); he's playing on pitches which make the trooper, Peter Hartley, a far more formidable proposition than the world's greatest leg-spinner, and bowling to a young keeper who has only been converted from an opening batsman because of an injury mini-crisis at Hampshire. Being Warne he's still competing furiously, still encouraging his new mates, but it must be a struggle. When playing for Australia, he has rarely had to bowl when the deficit is in excess of 200. He had to yesterday. The root of Hampshire's problems stems from the loss of confidence of their batsmen, though they are also handicapped by the continued absence of their other expensive winter acquisition, Alan Mullally.

      "body": "<p>After more than a century, WG Grace is about to lose the distinction of having paraded the the most dramatic head of hair in a Lord's Test match. But the dreadlocked Zimbabwean Henry Olonga will leave unscathed WG's reputation as probably the most irascible cricketer to play at HQ. </p> <p>It is hard not to make assumptions about a shock-haired fast bowler. In Olonga's case, though, you would almost certainly be wide of the mark. In fact I even found his easy charm and lack of menace a little disappointing. Take, for example, the explanation for how he keeps those dangling tresses a distinctive coppery colour: 'I bleach them with a home colouring kit that you can buy at any pharmacy.' Absentee doctor that he was, WG, you suspect, only went near a pharmacy in search of some substance with which to spike a rival fast bowler's refreshment. </p> <p>But it would be wrong to give the impression that the affable, accessible Olonga, who has a confidence in his ability that even WG would have admired, is without an interesting hinterland. Quite the contrary. </p> <p>Although numerous descriptions of him as an opera singer are fanciful, he did reveal a considerable singing talent at school, which he has had only limited opportunity to develop, but which he intends to exploit once his cricketing days are done. 'I have no extensive experience of singing since I left school,' he says, 'but I have developed my skill.' And how has he done that? 'Oh, singing in the shower,' he adds gleefully. 'I have improved immensely and it's mainly through listening to other musicians.' His taste is eclectic. He names R'n' B singers Eric Benet and Brian McKnight and, on the classical side, Andrea Bocelli and Roberto Alagna as among those he likes to copy. </p> <p>He has not decided which direction he hopes his singing career will take, but he thinks he will probably move into the pop scene, preferably as a solo artist. 'The easiest thing to do is get a bunch of five guys who can hold a note, gather some really good songwriters together, get a nice beat - and you've got the newest pop sensation. Boy bands are easy to form and they're wonderful, but I think I can offer more than that.' </p> <p>He is also artistic. 'Music is something I picked up,' he says. 'It wasn't a talent I knew I possessed. I just took it up and tried to do certain things and people said, \"Hey, you sound good. Why don't you pursue it?\" But art was always something I knew I could do from a young age; so I draw, I paint - oils, water-colours, pastels, you name it. I've always had an interest in it and always will have, but I wouldn't take it up as a career.' </p> <p>And then there's his athletic prowess, beyond anything most cricketers possess. As a 16-year-old, he long-jumped 7.11 metres, ran a 10.6sec for the 100 metres and, as a senior, threw the javelin more than 60 metres. 'I could easily have pursued a career in athletics.' </p> <p>But he chose cricket, and it is after fielding practice at Essex's Chelmsford ground last week that we sit and chat. He talks openly, except when I ask him how he feels about the situation in Zimbabwe - a banned topic, it turns out. Even so he is unable to resist saying something: 'I can't comment on the political side of things, but, if that's your question, I'll give you a simple answer: I feel tense, worried and not happy. But I think there are some positive things that will come out of it. I'll leave it at that.' </p> <p>He also talks with a slightly mannered accent, the result possibly of being privately educated in Zimbabwe where he has lived for most of his 23 years, having been born in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, where his mother was a nurse and his father a doctor. Early on, the family moved to Kenya, but when his parents split up soon after that, his mother, a Zimbabwean, went to live in Bulawayo, which has been his home town since. </p> <p>He became a cricketer at school, where he says his progress was steady rather than spectacular, although he remembers an eight-wicket haul against Brighton College, traditionally one of the stronger English school sides, when they visited in 1994. After school, he advanced rapidly, and in 1995 became the first black player to represent Zimbabwe after being picked for the opening Test against Pakistan. It proved a chastening experience. </p> <p>On the third morning, Olonga was called for throwing by the home umpire Ian Robinson - England's Mervyn Kitchen was at the other end - and his future was put in doubt. 'I was a freshman, just out of school, keen to impress, wanting to bowl fast,' he says. 'Initially, it hit me with a sense of disbelief - shock, I suppose - and I guess at the time I had my various conspiracy theories. But when I eventually saw the videotape, I thought, \"Well, OK, maybe there is a problem\".' </p> <p>Olonga reacted determinedly, travelling to Dennis Lillee's bowling academy in Madras the following month. 'Lillee was very supportive. He said, \"You've got a problem - but don't worry, we'll sort it out.\" He felt I had a mixed action, somewhere between Sean Pollock, who's one of the better side-on bowlers, and Lance Klusener, who's totally chest-on, and not only would this make me prone to injury, but would account for my throwing the ball.</p> <p>'He sensed that I was a natural front-on bowler who had been told to bowl side-on, and so he got me bowling chest-on. I've changed again slightly since then, but I'm still pretty much a chest-on bowler.' </p> <p>With his new action, Olonga regained his place in the Zimbabwean side and has given some notable performances, including the four second-innings wickets that helped bowl Pakistan to defeat in the Test in Peshawar in November 1998, the three wickets in the penultimate over that gained a three-run win over India in last year's World Cup, and his six for 19 in a one-day international against England in Cape Town last January, which 'surpassed anything I expected I could do'. </p> <p>And he thinks upsetting England again at Lord's is not beyond the team's capacity: 'We're becoming more and more efficient at getting into strong, winning positions, so I wouldn't rule out a Zimbabwean win.' That would be something to sing in the shower about. </p> <p><strong> Test matches</strong> 18 </p> <p><strong> Batting</strong> </p> <p>Innings: 27 </p> <p>Runs: 99 </p> <p>Average: 5.21 </p> <p><strong> Bowling</strong> </p> <p>Overs: 464.4 </p> <p>Runs: 1459 </p> <p>Wickets: 47 </p> <p>Average: 31.04</p>",

But when I eventually saw the videotape, I thought, \"Well, OK, maybe there is a problem\".' Olonga reacted determinedly, travelling to Dennis Lillee's bowling academy in Madras the following month. 'Lillee was very supportive. He said, \"You've got a problem - but don't worry, we'll sort it out.\" He felt I had a mixed action, somewhere between Sean Pollock, who's one of the better side-on bowlers, and Lance Klusener, who's totally chest-on, and not only would this make me prone to injury, but would account for my throwing the ball. 'He sensed that I was a natural front-on bowler who had been told to bowl side-on, and so he got me bowling chest-on. I've changed again slightly since then, but I'm still pretty much a chest-on bowler.' With his new action, Olonga regained his place in the Zimbabwean side and has given some notable performances, including the four second-innings wickets that helped bowl Pakistan to defeat in the Test in Peshawar in November 1998, the three wickets in the penultimate over that gained a three-run win over India in last year's World Cup, and his six for 19 in a one-day international against England in Cape Town last January, which 'surpassed anything I expected I could do'. And he thinks upsetting England again at Lord's is not beyond the team's capacity: 'We're becoming more and more efficient at getting into strong, winning positions, so I wouldn't rule out a Zimbabwean win.' That would be something to sing in the shower about. Test matches 18 Batting Innings: 27 Runs: 99 Average: 5.21 Bowling Overs: 464.4 Runs: 1459 Wickets: 47 Average: 31.04",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The stench enveloping Italian football in the wake of Juventus's controversial victory over Parma has prompted an investigation into events before and after the game by Turin's public magistrate. </p> <p>Since Fabio Cannavaro's last-minute header for Parma was inexplicably disallowed by referee Massimo De Santis, giving Juve a 1-0 win last Sunday, Italy has been swept by an extraordinary tidal wave of anti-Juve sentiment. There have been death threats against the referee's family, violent street protests in Rome and the president of the Italian FA has said he may look to bring in foreign match officials next season. </p> <p>No one has made an outright claim that Juve have broken any law, but it has been a close-run thing. And one of their top men, general manager Luciano Moggi, is the target for vitriolic criticism because of the power he allegedly wields over Italian football. More of him later. </p> <p>Juve should claim their 26th Serie A title in today's last round with a win at Perugia but if there is an ounce of sense left in Italian football their celebrations will be muted. </p> <p>The feelings are strongest in Rome, where Lazio are left two points behind the Turin club thanks to referee De Santis's decision. Midweek street protests are forecast to continue today with two major events - the Giro d'Italia cycle race and the Italian Open tennis finals - braced for violence. Lazio are hosting Reggina just a few hundred yards from the Foro Italico tennis complex. </p> <p>One of the leaders of Lazio's hard-line 'ultras' fans, Fabio Piscitelli, said today's demonstrations would include a 'funeral' of Italian soccer, with a real coffin in Rome's Piazzale Flaminio. Fans will then enter the stadium for Lazio's match 15 minutes late. </p> <p>Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti claimed: 'This championship is losing credibility. I can't invest millions in this club and then find we are in this unclear situation.' </p> <p>Had the goal stood, and the game ended in a 1-1 draw, Lazio and Juve would have gone into today's games level on points and with a title play-off almost certain (goal difference is not a factor in Serie A ). 'Sorry, but this is a scandal' was the front-page headline in Rome's Corriere dello Sport the day after the match, probably the mildest comment on its pages this week. </p> <p>Within half an hour of the game ending De Santis had explained his decision to annul Cannavaro's goal to a reporter. He claimed to have blown the whistle before the Parma defender headed the ball goalwards, having spotted some pushing as Marcio Amoroso's corner came over. When Cannavaro himself appeared in front of the press, his reaction was the same as in the moments after the whistle blew - he was just laughing. </p> <p>Television replays clearly showed he had whistled after Cannavaro connected with the ball - and that there was no foul to be seen. From early Sunday evening to past midnight on Monday there are shows that contain nothing other than action replays of controversial incidents, scrutinised by a panel of journalists. Not one of the judges in these self-styled 'courts of calcio' was able to find a reason why the goal was disallowed. </p> <p>It is not the first time Juventus are in sight of a title that few but their own fans feel they deserve. In Florence they still rage over the 1982 season when Fiorentina were pipped to the title by Juve on the final day thanks to dubious refereeing which favoured Juve and punished Fiorentina. </p> <p>More recently, during what Italians call 'the season of poison' two years ago, Juve were neck and neck with Inter. Juve won 1-0 at Empoli, who were denied an equaliser when the ball clearly crossed the line. A week later Juve beat Inter 1-0 at the Delle Alpi but Inter had a clear penalty turned down, leaving their president, Massimo Moratti, claiming Juventus have a psychological grip over referees. </p> <p>'Referees don't do this on purpose; it's a habit. They are afraid of hurting Juventus. It is the rule not the exception,' said Moratti at the time. </p> <p>The veteran Lazio striker Roberto Mancini went closest to suggesting foul play when he claimed the last nine championships had been rigged. 'The last fair championship was won in 1991 by Sampdoria. Since then Juventus and Milan have shared the titles between them and have never fought each other for the championship.' </p> <p>Such sentiments are not hard to find in Italy. </p> <p>'These accusations, which have no proof attached to them and which continue to be hurled at the club, are intolerable,' says Juventus club secretary Antonio Giraudo, the only man at the club who has been allowed to speak in public since Sunday. </p> <p>'In no other foreign country is one episode seen as more important while all others are forgotten. No one accuses Real Madrid, Barcelona, Ajax, Manchester United or Bayern of having won by foul play.' </p> <p>Fair comment. But why is there always an air of suspicion around Juventus whenever a mistake is made in their favour? The most com mon explanation is Moratti's argument that referees are conditioned to be afraid of Juventus and their decisions reflect that fear. Others hint at the power of Juve's owners the Agnelli family, owners of the Fiat group and Italy's unofficial royal family. </p> <p>But some suggest darker forces. The Roma president Franco Sensi, the most outspoken critic of northern domination of Italian football, points the finger firmly at the Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi. He said: 'Why do the Rome teams find it difficult to win the title? Ask Moggi. It will be this way until Moggi isn't against us. It is not enough to invest millions to win.' </p> <p>Moggi is officially in charge of Juventus's transfer policy and the general management of team affairs. In reality his role at Juventus and in Italian football is far greater. After 20 years working for the state railway company, he began his career in football as a youth scout for Juventus and worked his way up the ladder with spells in administration at Roma, Torino and Napoli before returning to Juve in his current role. He is known as the 'king of the transfer market' and together with his son Alessandro, one of the leading players' agents in Italy, is reported to have 250 players within his sphere. </p> <p>When lower division Italian clubs gather in a Milan hotel twice a year to trade players, Moggi is one of the few representatives of a Serie A club to bother turning out, wheeling and dealing, and building his links with club officials from Serie B and C . A recent report claimed Moggi's network included at least 18 lower division clubs as well as five 'friendly' clubs in Serie A . </p> <p>Before he moved to Juventus he worked at Torino with Luciano Nizzola and helped Nizzola to be elected president of the Italian FA in 1996. When that link was raised this week, Nizzola flew off the handle. 'We are just friends. When we meet we don't even talk about football,' he replied. But to many, Nizzola is seen as Moggi's man. </p> <p>Some believe he has the power to end careers. Former Fiorentina coach Giancarlo De Sisti believes that he has been out of work for eight years because of Moggi: 'I had some conflicts with the president of the club. He was a friend of Moggi's.' </p> <p>Di Sisti then criticised Moggi in the press. 'I can't prove anything but I haven't found work since then,' he says. </p> <p>Such power is reminiscent of the late Italo Allodi, who was considered the most potent man in Italian football three decades ago. Allodi, frequently accused of match- rigging but never found guilty, recruited Moggi at Juventus. Like Moggi, Allodi, who worked for Inter before moving to Juventus, had a wide network of allies that spread far beyond his own club. Like Moggi, Allodi was the man people blamed when something suspicious happened with referees. And like Moggi, Allodi appeared to revel in his shadowy reputation. </p> <p>Moggi does little to discourage the mystique that surrounds him. Asked if Italian football was suffering because of suspicions that his power and influence was too great he replied with a Chinese proverb: 'If your shoe is unlaced, watch out when you bend down to lace it in a field of melons. Those that see you could misunderstand you.' That's cleared it all up then.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The stench enveloping Italian football in the wake of Juventus's controversial victory over Parma has prompted an investigation into events before and after the game by Turin's public magistrate. Since Fabio Cannavaro's last-minute header for Parma was inexplicably disallowed by referee Massimo De Santis, giving Juve a 1-0 win last Sunday, Italy has been swept by an extraordinary tidal wave of anti-Juve sentiment. There have been death threats against the referee's family, violent street protests in Rome and the president of the Italian FA has said he may look to bring in foreign match officials next season. No one has made an outright claim that Juve have broken any law, but it has been a close-run thing. And one of their top men, general manager Luciano Moggi, is the target for vitriolic criticism because of the power he allegedly wields over Italian football. More of him later. Juve should claim their 26th Serie A title in today's last round with a win at Perugia but if there is an ounce of sense left in Italian football their celebrations will be muted. The feelings are strongest in Rome, where Lazio are left two points behind the Turin club thanks to referee De Santis's decision. Midweek street protests are forecast to continue today with two major events - the Giro d'Italia cycle race and the Italian Open tennis finals - braced for violence. Lazio are hosting Reggina just a few hundred yards from the Foro Italico tennis complex. One of the leaders of Lazio's hard-line 'ultras' fans, Fabio Piscitelli, said today's demonstrations would include a 'funeral' of Italian soccer, with a real coffin in Rome's Piazzale Flaminio. Fans will then enter the stadium for Lazio's match 15 minutes late. Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti claimed: 'This championship is losing credibility. I can't invest millions in this club and then find we are in this unclear situation.' Had the goal stood, and the game ended in a 1-1 draw, Lazio and Juve would have gone into today's games level on points and with a title play-off almost certain (goal difference is not a factor in Serie A ). 'Sorry, but this is a scandal' was the front-page headline in Rome's Corriere dello Sport the day after the match, probably the mildest comment on its pages this week. Within half an hour of the game ending De Santis had explained his decision to annul Cannavaro's goal to a reporter. He claimed to have blown the whistle before the Parma defender headed the ball goalwards, having spotted some pushing as Marcio Amoroso's corner came over. When Cannavaro himself appeared in front of the press, his reaction was the same as in the moments after the whistle blew - he was just laughing. Television replays clearly showed he had whistled after Cannavaro connected with the ball - and that there was no foul to be seen. From early Sunday evening to past midnight on Monday there are shows that contain nothing other than action replays of controversial incidents, scrutinised by a panel of journalists. Not one of the judges in these self-styled 'courts of calcio' was able to find a reason why the goal was disallowed. It is not the first time Juventus are in sight of a title that few but their own fans feel they deserve. In Florence they still rage over the 1982 season when Fiorentina were pipped to the title by Juve on the final day thanks to dubious refereeing which favoured Juve and punished Fiorentina. More recently, during what Italians call 'the season of poison' two years ago, Juve were neck and neck with Inter. Juve won 1-0 at Empoli, who were denied an equaliser when the ball clearly crossed the line. A week later Juve beat Inter 1-0 at the Delle Alpi but Inter had a clear penalty turned down, leaving their president, Massimo Moratti, claiming Juventus have a psychological grip over referees. 'Referees don't do this on purpose; it's a habit. They are afraid of hurting Juventus. It is the rule not the exception,' said Moratti at the time. The veteran Lazio striker Roberto Mancini went closest to suggesting foul play when he claimed the last nine championships had been rigged. 'The last fair championship was won in 1991 by Sampdoria. Since then Juventus and Milan have shared the titles between them and have never fought each other for the championship.' Such sentiments are not hard to find in Italy. 'These accusations, which have no proof attached to them and which continue to be hurled at the club, are intolerable,' says Juventus club secretary Antonio Giraudo, the only man at the club who has been allowed to speak in public since Sunday. 'In no other foreign country is one episode seen as more important while all others are forgotten. No one accuses Real Madrid, Barcelona, Ajax, Manchester United or Bayern of having won by foul play.' Fair comment. But why is there always an air of suspicion around Juventus whenever a mistake is made in their favour? The most com mon explanation is Moratti's argument that referees are conditioned to be afraid of Juventus and their decisions reflect that fear. Others hint at the power of Juve's owners the Agnelli family, owners of the Fiat group and Italy's unofficial royal family. But some suggest darker forces. The Roma president Franco Sensi, the most outspoken critic of northern domination of Italian football, points the finger firmly at the Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi. He said: 'Why do the Rome teams find it difficult to win the title? Ask Moggi. It will be this way until Moggi isn't against us. It is not enough to invest millions to win.' Moggi is officially in charge of Juventus's transfer policy and the general management of team affairs. In reality his role at Juventus and in Italian football is far greater. After 20 years working for the state railway company, he began his career in football as a youth scout for Juventus and worked his way up the ladder with spells in administration at Roma, Torino and Napoli before returning to Juve in his current role. He is known as the 'king of the transfer market' and together with his son Alessandro, one of the leading players' agents in Italy, is reported to have 250 players within his sphere. When lower division Italian clubs gather in a Milan hotel twice a year to trade players, Moggi is one of the few representatives of a Serie A club to bother turning out, wheeling and dealing, and building his links with club officials from Serie B and C . A recent report claimed Moggi's network included at least 18 lower division clubs as well as five 'friendly' clubs in Serie A . Before he moved to Juventus he worked at Torino with Luciano Nizzola and helped Nizzola to be elected president of the Italian FA in 1996. When that link was raised this week, Nizzola flew off the handle. 'We are just friends. When we meet we don't even talk about football,' he replied. But to many, Nizzola is seen as Moggi's man. Some believe he has the power to end careers. Former Fiorentina coach Giancarlo De Sisti believes that he has been out of work for eight years because of Moggi: 'I had some conflicts with the president of the club. He was a friend of Moggi's.' Di Sisti then criticised Moggi in the press. 'I can't prove anything but I haven't found work since then,' he says. Such power is reminiscent of the late Italo Allodi, who was considered the most potent man in Italian football three decades ago. Allodi, frequently accused of match- rigging but never found guilty, recruited Moggi at Juventus. Like Moggi, Allodi, who worked for Inter before moving to Juventus, had a wide network of allies that spread far beyond his own club. Like Moggi, Allodi was the man people blamed when something suspicious happened with referees. And like Moggi, Allodi appeared to revel in his shadowy reputation. Moggi does little to discourage the mystique that surrounds him. Asked if Italian football was suffering because of suspicions that his power and influence was too great he replied with a Chinese proverb: 'If your shoe is unlaced, watch out when you bend down to lace it in a field of melons. Those that see you could misunderstand you.' That's cleared it all up then.",

Perhaps Chelsea were never going to win the Champions League with their team of elderly cast-offs, but one could hardly say the same of Barcelona, who threw everything at Europe and lasted just one round longer.

Money worries come to the fore as enemies appear to prosper at your expense. Oh, and Germany will invade Greece.</p> <p>Ministers in Winston Churchill's War Cabinet were so worried about the impact on public morale of newspaper astrologers that they considered outlawing them. Such portents could be desperately worrying for the wife of a soldier on the front line during the Second World War, they believed.</p> <p>Their concerns are revealed in declassified government documents from the Public Records Office. Minutes of the War Cabinet's Civil Defence Committee, dated 7 January 1942 and titled 'Astrology and the Press', state: 'The Financial Secretary to the Treasury [Viscount Crookshank] expressed concern at the popularity of contributions by so-called astrologers writing in the Press and particularly in the Sunday Press.</p> <p>'He believed that the illusions disseminated in this way had a harmful effect on public morale and on the war effort. He suggested strong action should be taken to put a stop to this form of journalism.'</p> <p>Following discussion it was pointed out that the 'popularity of these contributors depended not on the general level of accuracy which they maintained but on the one or two sensational instances in which their forecasts have been verified by events'.</p> <p>The committee came under the control of Peter Mandelson's grandfather, Herbert Morrison, who was Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security during the war.</p> <p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Information was asked to prepare a report on the effect 'of this form of journalism on the public mind'.</p> <p>The minutes, unearthed by historian Dr A. D. Harvey, conclude: 'It would be of interest also if the figures could be given showing the percentage of instances in which the forecasts of the various prophets had been justified by events.'</p> <p>Just over two weeks later, the Ministry of Information responded.

      "bodyText": "As the moon approaches Saturn, your love life will face a period of turmoil and your career prospects will suffer a severe a setback. Money worries come to the fore as enemies appear to prosper at your expense. Oh, and Germany will invade Greece. Ministers in Winston Churchill's War Cabinet were so worried about the impact on public morale of newspaper astrologers that they considered outlawing them. Such portents could be desperately worrying for the wife of a soldier on the front line during the Second World War, they believed. Their concerns are revealed in declassified government documents from the Public Records Office. Minutes of the War Cabinet's Civil Defence Committee, dated 7 January 1942 and titled 'Astrology and the Press', state: 'The Financial Secretary to the Treasury [Viscount Crookshank] expressed concern at the popularity of contributions by so-called astrologers writing in the Press and particularly in the Sunday Press. 'He believed that the illusions disseminated in this way had a harmful effect on public morale and on the war effort. He suggested strong action should be taken to put a stop to this form of journalism.' Following discussion it was pointed out that the 'popularity of these contributors depended not on the general level of accuracy which they maintained but on the one or two sensational instances in which their forecasts have been verified by events'. The committee came under the control of Peter Mandelson's grandfather, Herbert Morrison, who was Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security during the war. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Information was asked to prepare a report on the effect 'of this form of journalism on the public mind'. The minutes, unearthed by historian Dr A. D. Harvey, conclude: 'It would be of interest also if the figures could be given showing the percentage of instances in which the forecasts of the various prophets had been justified by events.' Just over two weeks later, the Ministry of Information responded. The Parliamentary Secretary stated that an extensive investigation was carried out in July 1941. According to this report, about two-thirds of the adult population read astrological columns, although only four out of 10 gave them any credence. At most, 'one in 10, and probably of a neurotic type, make astrology a major interest in their lives and allow it to play some part in forming their conduct'. The report found no evidence that the more fantastic advice such as 'that the public should shelter in hollows in the ground instead of air-raid shelters' was ever followed. The report published a table of the four best-known Sunday astrologers and whether or not their predictions had proved correct on various issues, including the outbreak of war, the invasion of Norway, the collapse of France and the British offensive in Libya. Nearly all the astrologers correctly predicted the last. The most accurate was R. H. Naylor of the Sunday Express, who sprang to fame by correctly predicting the 1937 Hindenburg airship explosion. He predicted the German invasions of Norway, Greece and Crete. Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris is believed to have taken his advice before launching bombing missions over Germany. The Great Lyndoe of The People and Petulengro of the Sunday Chronicle both predicted Germany's invasion of Russia, but none of the famed astrologers predicted the outbreak of war. Nick Campian, a former astrologer at the Daily Mail who is an astrological historian, says these documents prove how seriously astrology was taken during the war. 'It was widely thought that Hitler used astrology, and the British Army used Hungarian astrologist Louis de Wohl to give them advice.' The Ministry of Information report concluded: 'It would appear, therefore, that the astrologers have a considerable amusement value, but otherwise exert very little influence on the public, except in the case of neurotic individuals, for whom they supply a relatively harmless prop.'",

They were told that the research was unpublished and unobtainable, which they recorded in their final report.</p> <p>But The Observer has learnt that the research, published in an international scientific journal in 1996, was peer reviewed by other scientists and has been easily obtained by ordinary members of the public who gave evidence during the expert group's investigation.</p> <p>First published in Dutch journal The Science of the Total Environment, the study by the Latvian Academy of Sciences examined the impact of a military radio transmitter on local schoolchildren, comparing them with a control group.</p> <p>The research, which studied nearly 1,000 children aged 9 to 18, found that 'memory and attention were significantly impaired in all children living in front of the Skrunda station'.</p> <p>Dr Hilary Kennedy, a biologist and chairperson of Northern Ireland Families against Telecommunications Transmitter Towers (NIFATT), said: 'The nature of the radiation from both installations is pulsed. It is pulse radiation which now gives most cause for concern.'</p> <p>The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones acknowledged that pulse radiation, used in the digital signals of most modern mobile phones, needs more research.</p> <p>Most of the scientific evidence reviewed by the independent panel related to old analogue signals. 'I believe that the NRPB has misled Sir William Stewart's committee,' said NIFATT's secretary, Margaret Dean. 'By withholding the findings of this important study I also believe the NRPB is guilty of a gross disservice to the general public.'</p> <p>Two of the expert group broke ranks this weekend to condemn the NRPB's failure to advise Ministers or the public properly. The panel glossed over its views on the agency last week. But the two lay panel members, John Fellows, outgoing president of Edinburgh University Students' Union, and Marie-No\u00eblle Barton, national manager of Women into Science and Engineering Campaign, brought in to represent ordinary people, say NRPB heads were sly and insensitive.</p> <p>'It became quite clear that if the NRPB had been doing its job properly there would have been no need for our committee,' said Fellows. The panel was told by the Department of Trade and Industry's observer that the NRPB refused a year ago to measure how much energy from the phone is absorbed by body tissue - the Specific Energy Absorption Rate (SAR) - despite an offer of a six-figure sum to do so.</p> <p>One of the group's main recommendations is that handsets display SAR so consumers can choose phones which emit lower levels. Barton, the only woman in the 12-member group, said: 'People just want to know whether phones are safe or not, yes or no.

      "bodyText": "Vital evidence of harmful effects on children from transmitter masts was kept from the expert group which last week reported on mobile phone safety. The independent panel asked the government agency acting as its secretariat, the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), for copies of a study on schoolchildren living near a radio mast in Latvia. They were told that the research was unpublished and unobtainable, which they recorded in their final report. But The Observer has learnt that the research, published in an international scientific journal in 1996, was peer reviewed by other scientists and has been easily obtained by ordinary members of the public who gave evidence during the expert group's investigation. First published in Dutch journal The Science of the Total Environment, the study by the Latvian Academy of Sciences examined the impact of a military radio transmitter on local schoolchildren, comparing them with a control group. The research, which studied nearly 1,000 children aged 9 to 18, found that 'memory and attention were significantly impaired in all children living in front of the Skrunda station'. Dr Hilary Kennedy, a biologist and chairperson of Northern Ireland Families against Telecommunications Transmitter Towers (NIFATT), said: 'The nature of the radiation from both installations is pulsed. It is pulse radiation which now gives most cause for concern.' The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones acknowledged that pulse radiation, used in the digital signals of most modern mobile phones, needs more research. Most of the scientific evidence reviewed by the independent panel related to old analogue signals. 'I believe that the NRPB has misled Sir William Stewart's committee,' said NIFATT's secretary, Margaret Dean. 'By withholding the findings of this important study I also believe the NRPB is guilty of a gross disservice to the general public.' Two of the expert group broke ranks this weekend to condemn the NRPB's failure to advise Ministers or the public properly. The panel glossed over its views on the agency last week. But the two lay panel members, John Fellows, outgoing president of Edinburgh University Students' Union, and Marie-No\u00eblle Barton, national manager of Women into Science and Engineering Campaign, brought in to represent ordinary people, say NRPB heads were sly and insensitive. 'It became quite clear that if the NRPB had been doing its job properly there would have been no need for our committee,' said Fellows. The panel was told by the Department of Trade and Industry's observer that the NRPB refused a year ago to measure how much energy from the phone is absorbed by body tissue - the Specific Energy Absorption Rate (SAR) - despite an offer of a six-figure sum to do so. One of the group's main recommendations is that handsets display SAR so consumers can choose phones which emit lower levels. Barton, the only woman in the 12-member group, said: 'People just want to know whether phones are safe or not, yes or no. People are confused and scared by jargon. 'Most queries the NRPB receives are about mobile phones and base stations but they spend a tiny fraction of their budget on this research. I used to use my phone for a 45-minute taxi ride because I thought that was efficient use of my time. Now I will not use it for more than two minutes.' sarah.ryle@observer.co.uk Useful links IEGMP on setting-up the Stewart report The issue explained Department of Health: government response to Stewart report Federation of the Electronics Industry:response to mobile phone health concerns National Radiological Protection Board",

The words are those of Professor Anthony Clare, medical director of St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin, and the interviewer in Radio 4's In the Psychiatrist's Chair .</p> <p>Clare has been giving evidence to an all-party parliamentary committee holding public hearings on the Irish government's Green Paper on abortion.</p> <p>Abortion is prohibited, but 5,000 Irish women a year travel to Britain to have them. That number is rising. It is this situation which the government has promised to address, either by holding a constitutional referendum on the issue, or by legislating to allow for abortion in strictly controlled circumstances.</p> <p>Abortion has been a bitterly divisive issue in Irish politics for 20 years and, as Clare reminded the legislators, it would be extremely foolish to think that 'the steam has gone out of it'.</p> <p>That is one reason why the government has gone to such pains to promote civilised debate. Nobody wants a repeat of the bitter divisions of l983, when a constitutional amendment pledging 'to protect the right to life of the unborn child' was put to referendum and carried by an overwhelming majority.</p> <p>In 1992 the whole situation was once more thrown into confusion when the Supreme Court ruled that a teenage girl, pregnant as the result of rape, should be allowed to travel to Britain to have an abortion, because her threat of suicide constituted a serious risk to her life.</p> <p>In theory, this decision meant that it should be possible to perform abortions in Irish hospitals, in similar circumstances. That hasn't happened. One eminent obstetrician told the all-party committee medical practice was unaffected by the ruling.</p> <p>But the public hearings have shown how far the debate has moved, at least within the Irish medical profession. It is now generally accepted, even by doctors opposed to any relaxation in the law, that pregnancies are terminated in Irish hospitals when the mother is at risk.</p> <p>A difficulty arises in deciding whether such cases constitute abortion or not. Professor John Bonnar, Chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, argues the procedures involved, while destroying the foetus, are not abortions because this is not the primary, deliberate intention.</p> <p>Some of his colleagues disagree. One obstetrician told the committee he believed an outright constitutional ban on abortion would lead, sooner or later, to a situation where a woman's life would be at risk and the doctor would have to decide whether or not to break the law.</p> <p>There are other agonising choices facing doctors and patients. A leading paediatrician raised the question of how a doctor should advise a couple who have learnt that their baby may be born severely handicapped. He cited the incidence of cystic fibrosis in Ireland, which is the highest in the world. There are couples who have two or three children suffering this tragic condition. In other countries termination of a second pregnancy would be the norm but this is not possible in Ireland. Instead, the couple have to decide whether to go to Britain.</p> <p>For most Irish women these arguments, while genuinely difficult, fail to address the real problem. The overwhelming majority of those who fly to Liverpool or London do so for more mundane reasons. Their method of contraception has failed, they lack social and emotional support, or cannot face bringing up a baby on their own.</p> <p>The London-based British Pregnancy Advisory Service, used by many Irish women, has presented a submission urging the Irish government to provide abortion facilities in their own country. It says: 'The women who come to us are not amoral, feckless or degenerate. They are normal women who have considered their position carefully and know that they must live with the consequences.'</p> <p>Many Irish women would like to see the government face this challenge. But they are not holding their breath.</p>",

It is this situation which the government has promised to address, either by holding a constitutional referendum on the issue, or by legislating to allow for abortion in strictly controlled circumstances. Abortion has been a bitterly divisive issue in Irish politics for 20 years and, as Clare reminded the legislators, it would be extremely foolish to think that 'the steam has gone out of it'. That is one reason why the government has gone to such pains to promote civilised debate. Nobody wants a repeat of the bitter divisions of l983, when a constitutional amendment pledging 'to protect the right to life of the unborn child' was put to referendum and carried by an overwhelming majority. In 1992 the whole situation was once more thrown into confusion when the Supreme Court ruled that a teenage girl, pregnant as the result of rape, should be allowed to travel to Britain to have an abortion, because her threat of suicide constituted a serious risk to her life. In theory, this decision meant that it should be possible to perform abortions in Irish hospitals, in similar circumstances. That hasn't happened. One eminent obstetrician told the all-party committee medical practice was unaffected by the ruling. But the public hearings have shown how far the debate has moved, at least within the Irish medical profession. It is now generally accepted, even by doctors opposed to any relaxation in the law, that pregnancies are terminated in Irish hospitals when the mother is at risk. A difficulty arises in deciding whether such cases constitute abortion or not. Professor John Bonnar, Chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, argues the procedures involved, while destroying the foetus, are not abortions because this is not the primary, deliberate intention. Some of his colleagues disagree. One obstetrician told the committee he believed an outright constitutional ban on abortion would lead, sooner or later, to a situation where a woman's life would be at risk and the doctor would have to decide whether or not to break the law. There are other agonising choices facing doctors and patients. A leading paediatrician raised the question of how a doctor should advise a couple who have learnt that their baby may be born severely handicapped. He cited the incidence of cystic fibrosis in Ireland, which is the highest in the world. There are couples who have two or three children suffering this tragic condition. In other countries termination of a second pregnancy would be the norm but this is not possible in Ireland. Instead, the couple have to decide whether to go to Britain. For most Irish women these arguments, while genuinely difficult, fail to address the real problem. The overwhelming majority of those who fly to Liverpool or London do so for more mundane reasons. Their method of contraception has failed, they lack social and emotional support, or cannot face bringing up a baby on their own. The London-based British Pregnancy Advisory Service, used by many Irish women, has presented a submission urging the Irish government to provide abortion facilities in their own country. It says: 'The women who come to us are not amoral, feckless or degenerate. They are normal women who have considered their position carefully and know that they must live with the consequences.' Many Irish women would like to see the government face this challenge. But they are not holding their breath.",

Not long after that, we had George Best's mother-in-law showing a brave face to reporters asking about the football star's health. 'He's got a stomach upset,' she said loyally. 'He's fine, really.' Then came the cancellation of Anna Kournikova's alleged engagement to hockey star Pavel Bure, allegedly because he baulked at having Mrs Kournikova Snr as a mother-in-law. This prompted columnists to write about how much power mothers-in-law have over the popular imagination. They went on to prove their own point by making a huge flap about Robin Cook's mother, when (after siding with his first wife Margaret during the divorce) she shocked onlookers by chatting with Gaynor at a party.</p> <p>There was another flurry of comment when Terri Apter published a study about tensions between married couples and their mothers. Then the mother-in-law joke had a revival when Italian lawyer Paola Mescoli Davoli started a Mother-in-Law School. Intrusive or disapproving mothers-in-law are cited in 40 per cent of Italy's divorce cases. The only way forward, said Davoli, was to make them use their power more carefully. In Britain, mothers-in-law are getting attention not because they are causing problems, but because people are starting to see how useful they are.</p> <p>One of the fondest hopes of Jack Straw and his Ministerial Group on the Family is that grandparents can be encouraged to play a larger role in rearing their grandchildren. Then the nation's children would be safe and sound while New Labour pushes their mothers into work.</p> <p>According to the Family Policy Studies Centre, grandparents are the main providers of childcare after parents. More than half of mothers and fathers over 50 help their adult children. Grandparents become more involved after family breakdown, but here there is a catch. According to a 1999 study by Geoff Dench and Katrina Thomson, grandfathers feel marginalised if their children divorce. They complained that they had too little time with grandchildren. Grandmothers said they had too much.</p> <p>No government should assume that there is a huge pool of grandparents eager to do childcare. Juliet Mountford of the FPSC says many grandparents feel they deserve time off. They want to travel, take up new hobbies and relax. There is very little research in this country on how grandparents feel about the new roles government is planning for them. Policy-makers 'tend not to take the grandparents' point of view,' says Mountford. Instead they use them to 'fill a gap'.</p> <p>The Family Policy group hopes a number of studies will stop this. Meantime it may be useful to look at the US, where census figures say the number of grandmothers involved in childcare has increased by 41 per cent since 1992. Other statistics identify 1.4 million children whose 'functional' parents are now their grandparents. This is largely an inner-city problem, as more women have been obliged to take over the care of grandchildren after their own children succumb to drug addiction or Aids, family breakdown or the need to find work.</p> <p>Childcare stress is affecting health to such a degree that geriatric parental stress is well under way to becoming a syndrome. Five years ago there wasn't one organisation offering grandparent carers advice and support. Now there are more than 600. There has been a parallel rise in training programmes. Some concentrate on helping grandmothers update their skills. For example, many have trouble helping with homework, because education has changed so much since their day, and they find modern discipline methods perplexing.

But suddenly they were handcuffed by FBI and NYPD officers who appeared out of nowhere. Kenny, soiled himself in fear.</p> <p>The police thought they were arresting 'Manny Guerrero' and his mother Sandy, wanted because the cheque which paid for the car in Utah had bounced. They were charged with theft. 'Manny' asked the officers if this really was about a car. If it was, he joked, he'd buy them all a drink when he got out.</p> <p>That night, the detective on the Lincoln case was watching the TV news. He saw pictures of a mother and son - Sante and Kenny Kimes - wanted over the disappearance that same day of a wealthy widow, Irene Silverman, famous socialite and owner of a Beaux Arts mansion on East 65th Street. The officer started; he had just booked both mother and son into his cell block.</p> <p>This weekend, Sante Kimes, aged 64, and her 24-year-old son are at different prisons in New York, waiting for Judge Rena Uviller to direct the jury tomorrow in the most flamboyant and bizarre murder case America has seen since O.J. Simpson - the murder of Irene Silverman.</p> <p>As the prosecution finished its summing-up at the end of the three-month trial last week, Kenny - a handsome man with chisel jaw and swept-back hair, now wild-eyed and nervous - kept having to leave the courtroom under escort. A detective in the case leaned forward to whisper: 'Say what? Now Kenny is shitting himself - literally.'</p> <p>It is an ignominious conclusion to the mystery, mayhem and murder that Sante and Kenny Kimes are accused of wreaking across America, a mother-and-son Bonnie &amp; Clyde team - 'Mommie and Clyde' they have been called - rumoured also to be lovers.</p> <p>It is an intriguing case. For the first time ever in a Manhattan murder trial history there are no witnesses, no forensic evidence and no body. There is only a stockpile of damning circumstantial evidence, and the fact that people have a habit of disappearing after last being seen with Sante and Kenny Kimes.</p> <p>Irene Silverman was bid goodnight in her home by two guests with whom she had dined on Independence Day evening. She was the daughter of a seamstress and had been a ballet dancer when she married the millionaire broker Sam Silverman, and although he died in 1980, she had not lost her love of life. But she was careful to protect it, only venturing out with friends or handsome male escorts.</p> <p>Silverman hardly needed the mansion to herself, and let out apartments. Number 1B had been rented to a man she disliked enormously and was planning to evict - the dapper but reticent 'Manny Guerrin', who had paid a $6,000 deposit in cash and produced no references. His real name was Kenny Kimes.</p> <p>According to the prosecution, Kimes and his mother seized 'that little old lady' outside the door of apartment 1B, dragged her inside, doped her with the 'date-rape' drug Flunitrapezepam, strangled her, wrapped her in a large black duffle bag, loaded the body into the boot of their car and dumped it on their way to meeting the man who was to manage the apartment, which they had just bought at a knock-down price with deeds bearing Silverman's forged signature. According to Kenny Kimes, mouthing the words in court for all to see 'it was suicide'.</p> <p>'What New York has on trial is a monster,' one of Sante Kimes's own relatives told Vanity Fair recently. She is indeed a scary woman. Her skin is like polished porcelain. She dresses elegantly. Between rounds of evidence, she picks out members of the press and public and fixes them with a cold, sharp stare from her jet-black eyes, deep-set beneath broad-brush black eyebrows, before then offering a friendly wave.</p> <p>Sante Kimes plagued the Vanity Fair writer with hysterical calls about her love for her son and corruption and violence by the authorities - to the horror of her lawyer.</p> <p>But tapes which were played in court - and which Kimes herself had recorded - reveal a different woman. The jury heard telephone conversations Kimes held with Silverman - in which she tried to lure her alleged victim to Las Vegas by posing as a company rep offering a free trip. On these, Kimes is silken, and unfazed by Silverman's suspicions.</p> <p>No one is certain who Sante Kimes is or where she comes from (she says her father was a Holy Man from India), only guesses by the authorities and journalists.</p> <p>She appears to have been born in Oklahoma, daughter of Rattan and Mary Singhrs, an Indian and an Irish immigrant. Mr Singhrs left his wife and child when the girl was two and her mother became a prostitute in Los Angeles. Sante was probably a victim of sexual abuse and was given up for adoption aged 10.</p> <p>She set out to climb the social ladder through crime and social scheming, and married Kenneth Kimes, a millionaire member of Washington political circles during the administration of President Gerald Ford, with whom the couple were once photographed.</p> <p>They were convicted of kidnapping Mexican girls and forcing them to work in 1985. According to a recent book by the New York Daily News crime writer, Kenny demanded sex from the girls when he was aged 10.</p> <p>But it was after Kenneth Kimes died in 1994, leaving his wife nothing, that her life of serious crime alongside Kenny began in earnest.</p> <p>In 1998, police in Los Angeles wanted to interrogate Sante and Kenny Kimes in connection with the shooting in May 1998 of a businessman, David Kadzin, whom they had tried to involve in a property scam. But they had vanished again.</p> <p>There were no grounds on which to detain Sante and Kenny Kimes's over the Kadzin murder, but the LAPD did have something useful: the cheque with which the couple had bought the tinted-windowed Lincoln Town Car in Cedar City, Utah, had bounced, and the police immediately put out an alert.</p> <p>On the day that Irene Silverman disappeared, the NYPD just happened to find the 'Guerreros' after the appearance of the Kimes's on television. They searched their car.</p> <p>There they found the ingredients of the Kimes's plan for a new life: a Glock 9mm handgun, a packet of hypodermic syringes, stocks of the 'date-rape' sedative which is 10 times more potent than valium and documents belonging to Silverman - including the forged deeds to her mansion. The prosecution also claims that 14 spiral-bound notebooks, containing lists of weapons and titles of videos about fraud as well as plans of Silverman's building and her Social Security number, are enough to prove intent to murder. The defence, however, says the notebooks are forgeries or may have been altered by police.</p> <p>No one has proved that mother and son are lovers. But the couple's chauffeur, Jose Alvarez, did testify during the trial that Sante and Kenny Kimes slept in the same bed (he also said he overheard them discuss dumping a body).</p> <p>During an interview on 60 Minutes, sensuality between them was there for all to see. 'I think [my mother] is a beautiful person,' swooned Kenny. 'Spiritually and intellectually. And physically.'</p> <p>Judge Rena Uviller had been due to direct the jury on Friday, but she postponed her task until tomorrow. She said that she didn't want to trouble the jurors' minds over this weekend - 'what with Mothers Day [which falls today in the US], which I'm sure some of you will want to celebrate'.</p>",

'Manny' asked the officers if this really was about a car. If it was, he joked, he'd buy them all a drink when he got out. That night, the detective on the Lincoln case was watching the TV news. He saw pictures of a mother and son - Sante and Kenny Kimes - wanted over the disappearance that same day of a wealthy widow, Irene Silverman, famous socialite and owner of a Beaux Arts mansion on East 65th Street. The officer started; he had just booked both mother and son into his cell block. This weekend, Sante Kimes, aged 64, and her 24-year-old son are at different prisons in New York, waiting for Judge Rena Uviller to direct the jury tomorrow in the most flamboyant and bizarre murder case America has seen since O.J. Simpson - the murder of Irene Silverman. As the prosecution finished its summing-up at the end of the three-month trial last week, Kenny - a handsome man with chisel jaw and swept-back hair, now wild-eyed and nervous - kept having to leave the courtroom under escort. A detective in the case leaned forward to whisper: 'Say what? Now Kenny is shitting himself - literally.' It is an ignominious conclusion to the mystery, mayhem and murder that Sante and Kenny Kimes are accused of wreaking across America, a mother-and-son Bonnie &amp; Clyde team - 'Mommie and Clyde' they have been called - rumoured also to be lovers. It is an intriguing case. For the first time ever in a Manhattan murder trial history there are no witnesses, no forensic evidence and no body. There is only a stockpile of damning circumstantial evidence, and the fact that people have a habit of disappearing after last being seen with Sante and Kenny Kimes. Irene Silverman was bid goodnight in her home by two guests with whom she had dined on Independence Day evening. She was the daughter of a seamstress and had been a ballet dancer when she married the millionaire broker Sam Silverman, and although he died in 1980, she had not lost her love of life. But she was careful to protect it, only venturing out with friends or handsome male escorts. Silverman hardly needed the mansion to herself, and let out apartments. Number 1B had been rented to a man she disliked enormously and was planning to evict - the dapper but reticent 'Manny Guerrin', who had paid a $6,000 deposit in cash and produced no references. His real name was Kenny Kimes. According to the prosecution, Kimes and his mother seized 'that little old lady' outside the door of apartment 1B, dragged her inside, doped her with the 'date-rape' drug Flunitrapezepam, strangled her, wrapped her in a large black duffle bag, loaded the body into the boot of their car and dumped it on their way to meeting the man who was to manage the apartment, which they had just bought at a knock-down price with deeds bearing Silverman's forged signature. According to Kenny Kimes, mouthing the words in court for all to see 'it was suicide'. 'What New York has on trial is a monster,' one of Sante Kimes's own relatives told Vanity Fair recently. She is indeed a scary woman. Her skin is like polished porcelain. She dresses elegantly. Between rounds of evidence, she picks out members of the press and public and fixes them with a cold, sharp stare from her jet-black eyes, deep-set beneath broad-brush black eyebrows, before then offering a friendly wave. Sante Kimes plagued the Vanity Fair writer with hysterical calls about her love for her son and corruption and violence by the authorities - to the horror of her lawyer. But tapes which were played in court - and which Kimes herself had recorded - reveal a different woman. The jury heard telephone conversations Kimes held with Silverman - in which she tried to lure her alleged victim to Las Vegas by posing as a company rep offering a free trip. On these, Kimes is silken, and unfazed by Silverman's suspicions. No one is certain who Sante Kimes is or where she comes from (she says her father was a Holy Man from India), only guesses by the authorities and journalists. She appears to have been born in Oklahoma, daughter of Rattan and Mary Singhrs, an Indian and an Irish immigrant. Mr Singhrs left his wife and child when the girl was two and her mother became a prostitute in Los Angeles. Sante was probably a victim of sexual abuse and was given up for adoption aged 10. She set out to climb the social ladder through crime and social scheming, and married Kenneth Kimes, a millionaire member of Washington political circles during the administration of President Gerald Ford, with whom the couple were once photographed. They were convicted of kidnapping Mexican girls and forcing them to work in 1985. According to a recent book by the New York Daily News crime writer, Kenny demanded sex from the girls when he was aged 10. But it was after Kenneth Kimes died in 1994, leaving his wife nothing, that her life of serious crime alongside Kenny began in earnest. In 1998, police in Los Angeles wanted to interrogate Sante and Kenny Kimes in connection with the shooting in May 1998 of a businessman, David Kadzin, whom they had tried to involve in a property scam. But they had vanished again. There were no grounds on which to detain Sante and Kenny Kimes's over the Kadzin murder, but the LAPD did have something useful: the cheque with which the couple had bought the tinted-windowed Lincoln Town Car in Cedar City, Utah, had bounced, and the police immediately put out an alert. On the day that Irene Silverman disappeared, the NYPD just happened to find the 'Guerreros' after the appearance of the Kimes's on television. They searched their car. There they found the ingredients of the Kimes's plan for a new life: a Glock 9mm handgun, a packet of hypodermic syringes, stocks of the 'date-rape' sedative which is 10 times more potent than valium and documents belonging to Silverman - including the forged deeds to her mansion. The prosecution also claims that 14 spiral-bound notebooks, containing lists of weapons and titles of videos about fraud as well as plans of Silverman's building and her Social Security number, are enough to prove intent to murder. The defence, however, says the notebooks are forgeries or may have been altered by police. No one has proved that mother and son are lovers. But the couple's chauffeur, Jose Alvarez, did testify during the trial that Sante and Kenny Kimes slept in the same bed (he also said he overheard them discuss dumping a body). During an interview on 60 Minutes, sensuality between them was there for all to see. 'I think [my mother] is a beautiful person,' swooned Kenny. 'Spiritually and intellectually. And physically.' Judge Rena Uviller had been due to direct the jury on Friday, but she postponed her task until tomorrow. She said that she didn't want to trouble the jurors' minds over this weekend - 'what with Mothers Day [which falls today in the US], which I'm sure some of you will want to celebrate'.",

That would be a mirror-image of Rudy Giuliani's month, a continuation of the symmetrical tango between the egos of the First Lady and the Mayor of New York who would - most voters agree - make the perfect couple. Giuliani is playing Hamlet - To Run or Not to Run; to continue in what was already a supercharged election or bow out gracefully, nurse his cancer and luxuriate in the vortex of love that envelops himself and Judi Nathan. But what also remains unclear is whether the most dramatic month in Giuliani's life is a bane or blessing for Hillary, as the best election of the year twists into something between grand and soap opera and vividly recalls that other domestic drama she lived through more painfully than anyone. The fallout from Mayor Giuliani's whirlwind affair could leave Hillary facing an opponent energised by love and testosterone, with a cancer sympathy vote enhanced by the properties of a mortal human that had hitherto eluded him but are essential to victory. Or it could mean an opponent whose moral deportment has dismayed his conservative and Catholic constituencies and whose lack of commitment to the fight deflates his hitherto unswerving crusade for the citizenry of New York. Or, indeed, to her having no serious opponent at all, cruising to victory without doing much.

Britain had the largest of the European empires in this troubled continent and, as it slides into chaos, it is Britain that is inevitably at the centre of the disastrous relationship between the two continents. Mr Mugabe's unilateral withdrawal yesterday of dual passport rights from white farmers holding British passports is but the latest manifestation of a crisis that was already serious enough even as Sierra Leone totters on the point of collapse. Mugabe has underlined what was already clear as barbaric rebels descended on Sierra Leone's Freetown. Whether or not we like it, Britain is compelled to engage with the explosive cocktail of poverty, tribalism, resentment and despotism that defines contemporary Africa.</p> <p>The Conservatives have been quick to criticise the Government's response in Sierra Leone. Britain should keep out, they say. If the United Nations cannot handle events, then so be it. No more the White Man's Burden; no more humanitarian interventions. British soldiers and sailors should not bail them out.</p> <p>But over Zimbabwe, the Conservatives take a different tack. Any intervention is contemplated to protect the interests of white farmers. Every looting, beating and murder is reported in depth. If there is a mass exit from Zimbabwe, there will be as intense pressure to welcome Zimbabwe's whites as there has been to deter asylum-seekers.</p> <p>The hypocrisy of the position is unsustainable. Britain was right to send troops to Sierra Leone. The written thanks of the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan are testimony to the importance of what we have done. A vital respite has been won while underequipped and undermanned UN forces are replenished. Britain is thus morally equipped to make a calibrated intervention in Zimbabwe, if any is needed. We act to preserve black and white lives alike from despotism, through whatever means we judge most effective.</p> <p>The more open question is what to do about attacking the roots of the crises throughout Africa. The West needs to revisit the idea of constructing stabilisation funds to support world commodity prices, a form of aid that directly helps Africa without clumsy, direct economic programmes that have failed so frequently. A rapid deployment force needs to be constructed, with a critical mass of well-trained Western soldiers capable of intervening to support UN mandates.</p> <p>That is for the medium term. In the here and now, we have to act and the Government deserves full support for what it has done in Sierra Leone and what it may have to do in Zimbabwe.</p>",

Mr Mugabe's unilateral withdrawal yesterday of dual passport rights from white farmers holding British passports is but the latest manifestation of a crisis that was already serious enough even as Sierra Leone totters on the point of collapse. Mugabe has underlined what was already clear as barbaric rebels descended on Sierra Leone's Freetown. Whether or not we like it, Britain is compelled to engage with the explosive cocktail of poverty, tribalism, resentment and despotism that defines contemporary Africa. The Conservatives have been quick to criticise the Government's response in Sierra Leone. Britain should keep out, they say. If the United Nations cannot handle events, then so be it. No more the White Man's Burden; no more humanitarian interventions. British soldiers and sailors should not bail them out. But over Zimbabwe, the Conservatives take a different tack. Any intervention is contemplated to protect the interests of white farmers. Every looting, beating and murder is reported in depth. If there is a mass exit from Zimbabwe, there will be as intense pressure to welcome Zimbabwe's whites as there has been to deter asylum-seekers. The hypocrisy of the position is unsustainable. Britain was right to send troops to Sierra Leone. The written thanks of the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan are testimony to the importance of what we have done. A vital respite has been won while underequipped and undermanned UN forces are replenished. Britain is thus morally equipped to make a calibrated intervention in Zimbabwe, if any is needed. We act to preserve black and white lives alike from despotism, through whatever means we judge most effective. The more open question is what to do about attacking the roots of the crises throughout Africa. The West needs to revisit the idea of constructing stabilisation funds to support world commodity prices, a form of aid that directly helps Africa without clumsy, direct economic programmes that have failed so frequently. A rapid deployment force needs to be constructed, with a critical mass of well-trained Western soldiers capable of intervening to support UN mandates. That is for the medium term. In the here and now, we have to act and the Government deserves full support for what it has done in Sierra Leone and what it may have to do in Zimbabwe.",

He thoroughly deserves his chance as he has been in wonderful touch so far this season and now has a chance to really cement his place in the England set-up.

He doesn't just bring his bat to the game, he is also an outstanding fielder. </p> <p>The work I put in over the winter has done me the power of good and I'm in no doubt that I'm bowling as well as I've ever done. The wickets have been much flatter this year and that means extra work for the bowlers, so I've been delighted with how I've performed in the early part of the season. </p> <p>I've often said that batting requires a strong mental approach but bowling is not too different.

      "body": "<p>There was joy for an Observer columnist (trust he won't require a pay rise) and a Durham rookie when David Graveney announced the squad of 13 for the Lord's Test, which begins on Thursday. Included for the first time is the lanky 21-year-old pace bowler Steve Harmison, while Ed Giddins, who made his Test debut at The Oval last year, is surprisingly recalled. </p> <p>Graveney said that the meeting held at Chelmsford on Friday night before the announcement in front of the Channel 4 cameras at Headingley yesterday morning (a nice little Friday night drive for him) had been dominated by the choice of pace bowlers to accompany the seniors, Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick. Old timers Angus Fraser and Martin Bicknell were discussed, so were youngsters Alex Tudor and Matthew Hoggard. </p> <p>Explaining the selectors' choice Graveney said that the name of Harmison was often 'the first mentioned when I talked to county captains and senior players on the circuit. He is capable of bowling at speed and with hostility'. No one will claim that he is reliable at this stage of his career as a succession of wides in Durham's B&amp;H quarter-final against Lancashire on Tuesday testifies, but he is capable of bowling some serious deliveries and already, after only 37 matches in English domestic cricket, he has a reputation for hitting batsmen (with the ball). It's a bold choice and probably a better move than the recall of an old reliable warhorse like Fraser. </p> <p>It seems that Giddins' self-financed winter fitness campaign has paid dividends. Graveney said: 'He would have been disappointed at his level of fitness when he played last summer. He needed to work on that and he's done so at his own expense [he spent much of the winter holed up at Lilleshall]. That has to be applauded. He's a very talented, very clever bowler and he may well benefit from [Allan] Donald taking him under his wing at Warwickshire this summer'. </p> <p>Giddins' ability to swing the ball at a slightly greater pace than Bicknell was crucial. Graveney was conscious of last year's Lord's Test against New Zealand (lost by England) when the ball swung consistently, especially for Dion Nash. Neither Gough, Caddick nor Harmison are considered big swingers of the ball by the selectors so Giddins gives them a 'swinging' option. The final decision over which pacemen are to accompany Gough and Caddick will be left until the morning of the match. None of the squad will be sent home early. </p> <p>The other non-contracted player selected is Warwickshire's Nick Knight, a double centurion this summer, who will bat at number six. Normally an opener, he has however batted for England at number six before; indeed his solitary Test century at Headingley against Pakistan in 1996 was in that position. Graham Thorpe, in poor form so far this summer was also discussed as were Northamptonshire's David Sales and Somerset's Marcus Trescothick, though Graveney pointed out that these selection meetings were also used for monitoring likely lads for the future as well as the make up of the next Test side. </p> <p>Of the contracted players Lancashire's Chris Schofield will be the most excited this weekend. Graveney lamented the standard of spin bowling in this country and went on to point out that even at international level finger spinners were in decline.

      "bodyText": "There was joy for an Observer columnist (trust he won't require a pay rise) and a Durham rookie when David Graveney announced the squad of 13 for the Lord's Test, which begins on Thursday. Included for the first time is the lanky 21-year-old pace bowler Steve Harmison, while Ed Giddins, who made his Test debut at The Oval last year, is surprisingly recalled. Graveney said that the meeting held at Chelmsford on Friday night before the announcement in front of the Channel 4 cameras at Headingley yesterday morning (a nice little Friday night drive for him) had been dominated by the choice of pace bowlers to accompany the seniors, Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick. Old timers Angus Fraser and Martin Bicknell were discussed, so were youngsters Alex Tudor and Matthew Hoggard. Explaining the selectors' choice Graveney said that the name of Harmison was often 'the first mentioned when I talked to county captains and senior players on the circuit. He is capable of bowling at speed and with hostility'. No one will claim that he is reliable at this stage of his career as a succession of wides in Durham's B&amp;H quarter-final against Lancashire on Tuesday testifies, but he is capable of bowling some serious deliveries and already, after only 37 matches in English domestic cricket, he has a reputation for hitting batsmen (with the ball). It's a bold choice and probably a better move than the recall of an old reliable warhorse like Fraser. It seems that Giddins' self-financed winter fitness campaign has paid dividends. Graveney said: 'He would have been disappointed at his level of fitness when he played last summer. He needed to work on that and he's done so at his own expense [he spent much of the winter holed up at Lilleshall]. That has to be applauded. He's a very talented, very clever bowler and he may well benefit from [Allan] Donald taking him under his wing at Warwickshire this summer'. Giddins' ability to swing the ball at a slightly greater pace than Bicknell was crucial. Graveney was conscious of last year's Lord's Test against New Zealand (lost by England) when the ball swung consistently, especially for Dion Nash. Neither Gough, Caddick nor Harmison are considered big swingers of the ball by the selectors so Giddins gives them a 'swinging' option. The final decision over which pacemen are to accompany Gough and Caddick will be left until the morning of the match. None of the squad will be sent home early. The other non-contracted player selected is Warwickshire's Nick Knight, a double centurion this summer, who will bat at number six. Normally an opener, he has however batted for England at number six before; indeed his solitary Test century at Headingley against Pakistan in 1996 was in that position. Graham Thorpe, in poor form so far this summer was also discussed as were Northamptonshire's David Sales and Somerset's Marcus Trescothick, though Graveney pointed out that these selection meetings were also used for monitoring likely lads for the future as well as the make up of the next Test side. Of the contracted players Lancashire's Chris Schofield will be the most excited this weekend. Graveney lamented the standard of spin bowling in this country and went on to point out that even at international level finger spinners were in decline. 'There are only Saqlain and Murali, who are unorthodox anyway, and New Zealand's Daniel Vettori'. So England are following the international trend by tossing in a wrist-spinner. It's a huge gamble - before this year Schofield had played only 12 first-class matches. It may be justifiable against Zimbabwe; but the selectors may be warier when the sterner opposition from the Caribbean arrive in this country, especially since Brian Lara, a master against spin if his mind is right, will presumably be taking guard.

But we first met in 1993, the year before I was elected to the European Parliament. I'd just arrived in Strasbourg, and because I was a novice, I thought it would be good to work with someone vibrant who knew their way round the European Parliament building as well as round the issues. We hit it off immediately, basically because we made each other laugh. In development, the issues can be quite depressing, so it's good to have someone around who can lighten things up. She's great at laughing at herself, too, and has never had any pomposity. We talk seriously, and she'll confide in me, though not as a mother figure. She assumes she's not perceived as intelligent - but she's actually highly intelligent, perceptive and energetic. <p> I always said Oona would go on to great things because I could see she had real political acumen. The only thing she wasn't good at was managing a diary, which meant I was never where I should have been. Once, I was heading for a meeting in the wrong direction in a taxi which then crashed, so I had to run to the right address. It was a nightmare, and of course when I told Oona she was terribly apologetic and serious about it. But after a while we both burst out laughing. It was just the thought of this poor taxi driver sitting on the pavement crying because his car was wrecked, and me crying because my life was in ruins.</p> <p>She sometimes gets herself into pickles. Nothing goes disastrously wrong, but there's a little twist of fate and suddenly all her plans have changed. There's always a slight edge of chaos, yet she's very focused.</p> <p>I was part of her life when she was preparing for her wedding. Dear, oh dear! What a massive exercise that was! I don't go in for that kind of thing, but the wedding was lovely. Her husband, Tiberio Santomarco, is very long-suffering. </p> <p>We both have tantrums about things, but never with each other. We never disagree on political issues either. I don't even have to ask her, I just know her views are the same as mine on anything from freedom of information to single parents. She's also deeply caring. She's a very important role model for women. She's also a great asset to the Labour Party - a young black woman who went to the local comprehensive and has her roots in the local community.</p> <p>People have labelled us as Old Labour and New Labour, but I hate that definition. We're a mixture of both. The main difference is our age and our roots. Oona is a Londoner through and through, whereas I was brought up in north Wales. Also, politically, my family were steeped in the Party, whereas hers was not. However, her dad was a Vietnam draft dodger so she's always had a strong political motivation. </p> <p>Before she worked with me, she hadn't specialised in development, but it was no surprise to me when she chose to be on the select committee on international development, which monitors Britain's money spent on development and reports back from places such as Mozambique and Rwanda. It was incredible being with Oona in Zambia last month. We went to promote Oxfam's education campaign because the literacy levels and school attendance levels in Zambia are some of the worst in the world. I think we made a great double act. We held meetings with teachers and parents, and because we weren't in competition with each other, we could balance the subject and manage the answers.</p> <p><b>Oona King</b> My first impression of Glenys was that she wasn't like a normal politician. By that I mean she hadn't had all the humour entirely squeezed out of her. That's probably why we get on so well. It depends, of course, whether you meet Glenys on or off the record. On the record, she's one of the most accomplished parliamentarians. Off the record, she's one of the funniest people you'd ever wish to have a laugh with. She's quieter than me, because after so many years of being at the very heart of British politics (literally in the belly of the beast) she's learned to be more restrained. But when she's not in public she's far, far more outrageous than I am.</p> <p>She's not bossy and was never frightening to work for but she's forceful and she usually gets what she wants. When she doesn't, the inside of her office will probably get to hear about it, but never the outside. She's almost demure outside. She's taught me a lot. I remember putting out a press release in which I repeated a joke she'd made about 'such and such' being about as funny as Michael Portillo with a broken hair dryer. I thought it was quite entertaining and astute, but when she saw it she just gave me this withering look. She didn't want people to think she was just there to make jokes. 'That's not the way you change things in politics,' she said. She was right. Five years later, I'm now an MP for Bethnal Green and Bow and I would never do that.</p> <p>We quarrelled all the time, though never seriously. It was often because Glenys thought she'd given me a piece of paper when I was sure she hadn't. I think I was utterly on top of every aspect of my job, with the exception of the diary, which we continually argued over. I'd send her to the wrong country with a speech I'd prepared on the wrong issue. If you work for a high-profile politician, the diary will probably kill you in the end. I remember Neil Kinnock often ringing me at 11pm wanting to know which country his wife was in.</p> <p>We share a similar sense of humour, which is quite sarcastic and fairly dry, but you can't use that in public too much because people misunderstand it. I've learned there are times to be serious and times not to be serious. </p> <p>Many politicians might think, what's the point of a field trip like ours, but Glenys always reminds me that this is the only way of getting to the essence, to the loss and the suffering. You can't imagine the enthusiasm she brought to Zambia. Seeing her with 40 five- to 10-year-olds clapping and singing songs brought joy to everyone's faces. She was a teacher for 30 years and she's got a real talent for it. She arranged for some schools there to twin with schools from her own constituency. We never stopped being shocked: more teachers were dying of Aids than passing through training. </p> <p>In Brussels, we spent 12 hours a day together, but when I got elected and had my own constituency to look after, I stopped being as close with virtually everyone I'd been close with before - that's the very, very worst thing about being a politician. </p> <p>\u0095 Oxfam's Education Now campaign (01865 313 123)</p>",

Before she worked with me, she hadn't specialised in development, but it was no surprise to me when she chose to be on the select committee on international development, which monitors Britain's money spent on development and reports back from places such as Mozambique and Rwanda. It was incredible being with Oona in Zambia last month. We went to promote Oxfam's education campaign because the literacy levels and school attendance levels in Zambia are some of the worst in the world. I think we made a great double act. We held meetings with teachers and parents, and because we weren't in competition with each other, we could balance the subject and manage the answers. Oona King My first impression of Glenys was that she wasn't like a normal politician. By that I mean she hadn't had all the humour entirely squeezed out of her. That's probably why we get on so well. It depends, of course, whether you meet Glenys on or off the record. On the record, she's one of the most accomplished parliamentarians. Off the record, she's one of the funniest people you'd ever wish to have a laugh with. She's quieter than me, because after so many years of being at the very heart of British politics (literally in the belly of the beast) she's learned to be more restrained. But when she's not in public she's far, far more outrageous than I am. She's not bossy and was never frightening to work for but she's forceful and she usually gets what she wants. When she doesn't, the inside of her office will probably get to hear about it, but never the outside. She's almost demure outside. She's taught me a lot. I remember putting out a press release in which I repeated a joke she'd made about 'such and such' being about as funny as Michael Portillo with a broken hair dryer. I thought it was quite entertaining and astute, but when she saw it she just gave me this withering look. She didn't want people to think she was just there to make jokes. 'That's not the way you change things in politics,' she said. She was right. Five years later, I'm now an MP for Bethnal Green and Bow and I would never do that. We quarrelled all the time, though never seriously. It was often because Glenys thought she'd given me a piece of paper when I was sure she hadn't. I think I was utterly on top of every aspect of my job, with the exception of the diary, which we continually argued over. I'd send her to the wrong country with a speech I'd prepared on the wrong issue. If you work for a high-profile politician, the diary will probably kill you in the end. I remember Neil Kinnock often ringing me at 11pm wanting to know which country his wife was in. We share a similar sense of humour, which is quite sarcastic and fairly dry, but you can't use that in public too much because people misunderstand it. I've learned there are times to be serious and times not to be serious. Many politicians might think, what's the point of a field trip like ours, but Glenys always reminds me that this is the only way of getting to the essence, to the loss and the suffering. You can't imagine the enthusiasm she brought to Zambia. Seeing her with 40 five- to 10-year-olds clapping and singing songs brought joy to everyone's faces. She was a teacher for 30 years and she's got a real talent for it. She arranged for some schools there to twin with schools from her own constituency. We never stopped being shocked: more teachers were dying of Aids than passing through training. In Brussels, we spent 12 hours a day together, but when I got elected and had my own constituency to look after, I stopped being as close with virtually everyone I'd been close with before - that's the very, very worst thing about being a politician. \u0095 Oxfam's Education Now campaign (01865 313 123)",

His odes are inspired by his favourite muse. 'Fatih Terim, Fatih Terim,' he starts up melodramatically. 'Emperor of Galatasaray...' </p> <p>As figureheads go, Terim stands alone in Turkish football. He was already worshiped for breathing new life into the national team before he began casting his spell on the country's most exalted club. Galatasaray currently shine like never before. They are on the verge of their fourth successive championship. With the domestic cup in the bag and a European final next week, they have in their sights a treble that would send the club's 18 million supporters worldwide into unprecedented raptures. Tell him he's probably the most successful coach in the entire continent operating outside the superpower countries of Spain, Italy, England and Germany and he won't disagree. Strutting around in own-label leisurewear embossed by his ornate signature, he's as comfortable with his status as the main man. </p> <p>It's sunset at the club's luxurious complex in the lush Florya district of Istanbul. Terim is sitting under the trees in the dappled shade sipping tea, his two grinning daughters rush over for a kiss hello, and he contemplates his lot. 'It's a nice life and we have had four years of success but I ask myself what more can I do? That's my way. One of my principles is to go further and further. No limits.' </p> <p>He is ambitious, out of contract in the summer, and keen to broaden his horizons. AC Milan, among other European heavyweights, are keeping a close eye on developments. </p> <p>People constantly beg him to stay. He's an icon in these parts. 'He is the soul of the club, his influence is huge, he is simply number one,' gushes Gala's attacker Arif. 'He's like a father to us and a brother to us.' And an uncle, who has been known to pay the players from his own pocket when wages were late. And a godfather, who accepts no messing and no disrespect and acts accordingly if any rules are breached. </p> <p>He has cracked it with his players. He has managed to get the balance between fear, trust, respect and love. They play for Terim as much as they play for themselves or their shirt. The relationship between players and boss works, he reckons, because he is young enough, at 46, to understand what makes them tick, but also experienced enough to guide them. They talk a lot, about life as well as football matters, and it has created a fantastic bond. Team spirit is one of their major assets. </p> <p>'All my players know if anything happens they must come and talk to me,' he insists. 'Personal problem, parents problem, wife problem, girlfriend problem, I have seen everything.' His penchant for talking, coupled with his immense confidence and charisma, has kept everyone on track during a bizarre season - on the one hand so thriving on the field, on the other so turbulent off it. In the aftermath of the Leeds incident some have forgotten that Galatasaray bore grief of their own. The Turkish earthquake was incredibly hard to come to terms with. Hakan Sukur's ex-wife was killed and Claudio Taffarel required therapy to overcome anxiety attacks. </p> <p>The deaths of two Leeds fans in Instanbul dismayed and saddened Terim, an anglophile, because he found it so inexplicable. He has willingly performed the role of spokesman and diplomat and he will continue to do so as long as people demand soundbites, but inwardly he believes it is time to move on. Closing the chapter rather than stoking the fire would have been a better prelude to Copenhagen. 'But,' as he is fond of saying, 'what can you do?' </p> <p>Mental fortitude, not a characteristic normally associated with Turkish football, has become a Galatsaray hallmark. This is the strongest Cim Bom team Terim, a stylish libero and captain here in his playing days, has seen. With influential foreigners like Hagi enjoying Indian summers and the Turks approaching peak it's the crest of a wave. It seems a summer exodus is on the cards. Sukur, rated by Terim as one of the most dangerous strikers in the world, is hotly coveted, as are Arif and the dynamic young Emre (suspended for the final). </p> <p>At the moment Terim bullishly argues that anyone who doesn't want to play for Galatasaray can go. 'We'll build another team,' he retorts. 'There's only one type of person I don't like. If somebody says, yeah that's enough for me, I'm very angry. You must always be hungry.' </p> <p>The other type he's not too keen on are ill-informed critics, who express surprise that his team, who have beaten the likes of Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Real Mallorca and Leeds this season, are so impressive. Surely they deserve more respect: 'Economically we are nothing, organisation is nothing, we have only five foreigners! My five cost maybe the same as one Bergkamp. No, make that one Vieira - Bergkamp is too expensive. </p> <p>'This is a big success for us, and a good chance to get more money, more foreigners, more success. It's an important time. We have to work hard to maintain this otherwise we'll end up with one final every hundred years, like now.' </p> <p>They have been waiting for the go-ahead for a $110 million, 48,000 stadium for two years. They are $25 million in debt. Winning the Uefa Cup would bring more than glory. </p> <p>But what glory if they do lick Arsenal. They are so consumed by the challenge they eased off domestically last Friday and lost at Altay when a point would have guaranteed the title. That has to wait while the romance of being the first Turkish side to grace a European final enthrals Instanbul. 'On the 17th of May life will stop,' predicts Terim, proudly. </p> <p>And he and his group of professionals might just join the party too. On the plane back from Leeds everyone was mystified to see the players quietly reading or listening to Walkmans. No celebrating yet. 'We were waiting. If we come back from Copenhagen with the cup we can do everything...' Only on the emperor's orders will festivities begin.</p>",

Hakan Sukur's ex-wife was killed and Claudio Taffarel required therapy to overcome anxiety attacks. The deaths of two Leeds fans in Instanbul dismayed and saddened Terim, an anglophile, because he found it so inexplicable. He has willingly performed the role of spokesman and diplomat and he will continue to do so as long as people demand soundbites, but inwardly he believes it is time to move on. Closing the chapter rather than stoking the fire would have been a better prelude to Copenhagen. 'But,' as he is fond of saying, 'what can you do?' Mental fortitude, not a characteristic normally associated with Turkish football, has become a Galatsaray hallmark. This is the strongest Cim Bom team Terim, a stylish libero and captain here in his playing days, has seen. With influential foreigners like Hagi enjoying Indian summers and the Turks approaching peak it's the crest of a wave. It seems a summer exodus is on the cards. Sukur, rated by Terim as one of the most dangerous strikers in the world, is hotly coveted, as are Arif and the dynamic young Emre (suspended for the final). At the moment Terim bullishly argues that anyone who doesn't want to play for Galatasaray can go. 'We'll build another team,' he retorts. 'There's only one type of person I don't like. If somebody says, yeah that's enough for me, I'm very angry. You must always be hungry.' The other type he's not too keen on are ill-informed critics, who express surprise that his team, who have beaten the likes of Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Real Mallorca and Leeds this season, are so impressive. Surely they deserve more respect: 'Economically we are nothing, organisation is nothing, we have only five foreigners! My five cost maybe the same as one Bergkamp. No, make that one Vieira - Bergkamp is too expensive. 'This is a big success for us, and a good chance to get more money, more foreigners, more success. It's an important time. We have to work hard to maintain this otherwise we'll end up with one final every hundred years, like now.' They have been waiting for the go-ahead for a $110 million, 48,000 stadium for two years. They are $25 million in debt. Winning the Uefa Cup would bring more than glory. But what glory if they do lick Arsenal. They are so consumed by the challenge they eased off domestically last Friday and lost at Altay when a point would have guaranteed the title. That has to wait while the romance of being the first Turkish side to grace a European final enthrals Instanbul. 'On the 17th of May life will stop,' predicts Terim, proudly. And he and his group of professionals might just join the party too. On the plane back from Leeds everyone was mystified to see the players quietly reading or listening to Walkmans. No celebrating yet. 'We were waiting. If we come back from Copenhagen with the cup we can do everything...' Only on the emperor's orders will festivities begin.",

      "body": "<p>Prison governors and former offenders have joined in condemning the crackdown on a 'model' prison with the lowest rate of drug use, assault and reoffending in the country.</p> <p>Blantyre House, a resettlement prison for serious offenders on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, was raided 10 days ago on the orders of Martin Narey, head of the Prison Service, after receiving intelligence of serious breaches of security by prisoners.</p> <p>In a statement issued this weekend, Narey said: 'The intelligence I received included information to suggest that there were discrepancies with security arrangements and that some prisoners might be involved in criminal activities.'</p> <p>The raid found unauthorised items, including mobile phones, cash, credit cards and cannabis. It also found evidence of 'large-scale unauthorised cash transactions'.</p> <p>The governor of Blantyre House, Eoin McLellan-Murray, and his deputy, David Newport, have been moved to other prisons, in a move widely interpreted as a criticism of their progressive methods. The operation is thought to have involved more than 100 prison officers, including members of the control and restraint team. The officers smashed through locked doors 'to ensure contraband was not being hidden'. The Prison Service is conducting an investigation into the security breaches, in collaboration with the police. Five inmates have been sent to other prisons.</p> <p>The progressive regime at Blantyre was praised in Parliament this year by Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe and Robin Corbett, the Labour chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who described it as a 'model'. In a debate in March, Corbett told Prisons Minister Paul Boateng: 'We must not risk destroying a regime that has demonstrated its success and deserves to continue to do so.'</p> <p>Widdecombe said: 'There are too few resettlement prisons - Kirklevington and Blantyre - and pretty well no more. Instead of reducing the precious few facilities available, we should seek to expand them.'</p> <p>Blantyre House is one of only two resettlement prisons designed for prisoners close to release. Inmates are given temporary release to work in the community and save their earnings in bank accounts until release. They are also allowed to use mobile phones outside the prison.</p> <p>Blantyre House, which houses around 120 prisoners, had the lowest rate of positive random drug-testing in the country last year at 0.7 per cent, and no assaults on staff. Of 16,000 licences given to inmates for temporary release last year, only two prisoners failed to return on time. The reconviction rate at Blantyre is 8 per cent compared with a national average of 54 per cent.</p> <p>Lynne Bowles, deputy president of the Prison Governors Association, said: 'It is very unusual to have this level of research. This was an extraordinary operation. I am not a party to the intelligence in the possession of the director-general of the Prison Service. But all my information suggests things were going well at the prison.'</p> <p>Alan Rogers, a former prisoner at the Kent prison with convictions for drugs and firearms offences, said: 'Blantyre House works. It has found a successful way of reintegrating prisoners back into society. Perhaps it is easier and less expensive to destroy one regime that works than it is to expand it across the prison system.'</p> <p>The experimental regime of McLellan-Murray and Newport was also defended last night by the Rev David Atkins, pastor of Calvary Church in Tunbridge Wells, who has been visiting Blantyre for three years.</p> <p>Atkins, an ex-Metropolitan Police Flying Squad officer, said: 'They are prison pioneers who have clearly had much success in changing many men's lives for the better. I can't protest too strongly at the action of the authorities in removing these governors from Blantyre.'</p> <p>Harry Fletcher, spokesman for the National Association of Probation Officers, added: 'Unless the intelligence received by Martin Narey was exceptionally serious, this was an extraordinary response.

      "bodyText": "Prison governors and former offenders have joined in condemning the crackdown on a 'model' prison with the lowest rate of drug use, assault and reoffending in the country. Blantyre House, a resettlement prison for serious offenders on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, was raided 10 days ago on the orders of Martin Narey, head of the Prison Service, after receiving intelligence of serious breaches of security by prisoners. In a statement issued this weekend, Narey said: 'The intelligence I received included information to suggest that there were discrepancies with security arrangements and that some prisoners might be involved in criminal activities.' The raid found unauthorised items, including mobile phones, cash, credit cards and cannabis. It also found evidence of 'large-scale unauthorised cash transactions'. The governor of Blantyre House, Eoin McLellan-Murray, and his deputy, David Newport, have been moved to other prisons, in a move widely interpreted as a criticism of their progressive methods. The operation is thought to have involved more than 100 prison officers, including members of the control and restraint team. The officers smashed through locked doors 'to ensure contraband was not being hidden'. The Prison Service is conducting an investigation into the security breaches, in collaboration with the police. Five inmates have been sent to other prisons. The progressive regime at Blantyre was praised in Parliament this year by Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe and Robin Corbett, the Labour chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who described it as a 'model'. In a debate in March, Corbett told Prisons Minister Paul Boateng: 'We must not risk destroying a regime that has demonstrated its success and deserves to continue to do so.' Widdecombe said: 'There are too few resettlement prisons - Kirklevington and Blantyre - and pretty well no more. Instead of reducing the precious few facilities available, we should seek to expand them.' Blantyre House is one of only two resettlement prisons designed for prisoners close to release. Inmates are given temporary release to work in the community and save their earnings in bank accounts until release. They are also allowed to use mobile phones outside the prison. Blantyre House, which houses around 120 prisoners, had the lowest rate of positive random drug-testing in the country last year at 0.7 per cent, and no assaults on staff. Of 16,000 licences given to inmates for temporary release last year, only two prisoners failed to return on time. The reconviction rate at Blantyre is 8 per cent compared with a national average of 54 per cent. Lynne Bowles, deputy president of the Prison Governors Association, said: 'It is very unusual to have this level of research. This was an extraordinary operation. I am not a party to the intelligence in the possession of the director-general of the Prison Service. But all my information suggests things were going well at the prison.' Alan Rogers, a former prisoner at the Kent prison with convictions for drugs and firearms offences, said: 'Blantyre House works. It has found a successful way of reintegrating prisoners back into society. Perhaps it is easier and less expensive to destroy one regime that works than it is to expand it across the prison system.' The experimental regime of McLellan-Murray and Newport was also defended last night by the Rev David Atkins, pastor of Calvary Church in Tunbridge Wells, who has been visiting Blantyre for three years. Atkins, an ex-Metropolitan Police Flying Squad officer, said: 'They are prison pioneers who have clearly had much success in changing many men's lives for the better. I can't protest too strongly at the action of the authorities in removing these governors from Blantyre.' Harry Fletcher, spokesman for the National Association of Probation Officers, added: 'Unless the intelligence received by Martin Narey was exceptionally serious, this was an extraordinary response. There needs to be an inquiry because it seems mightily convenient that this search happened when the Prison Service was facing opposition to its plans to change the role of the prison.' martin.bright@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>As tickets for the Olympics start to go on sale, the hot favourite is a seat to see Cathy Freeman, the 26-year-old Aboriginal runner from Mackay, Queensland, who is the Commonwealth 400 metres title holder.</p> <p>Sydney's sport-mad dashed to buy last Sunday's papers which all had competing Olympic ticket offers. But the day got far more exciting when more than 12,000 tickets for Freeman's first run on 22 September were, by accident, quoted at half-price.</p> <p>Freeman first grabbed the nation's attention in 1994, when after a win she ran a victory lap draped in both the Australian and Aboriginal flags. So when more than 8,000 A-list tickets (the best seats in the house) for the first round of the women's 400m were priced at A$85 (\u00a334) instead of the correct price of A$165 (\u00a366), the hotlines lit up. The 2,400 B-list seats (at either end of the oval stadium) were selling at \u00a326 rather than \u00a350. The 2,000 category C tickets (upper tiers) were a snip at \u00a318 instead of \u00a342.</p> <p>The Sydney Olympic organising committee, Socog, could lose up to $1m (\u00a3400,000) in the pricing fiasco. Its deputy chief executive, Michael Eyers, confessed his mistake to the Sydney press and promised the organisation would stand by the prices quoted.</p> <p>'We are bound by that, so the people who ordered them will get the tickets for the price advertised.'</p> <p>It has not yet emerged how the tickets for Freeman's session came to be mispriced, but to Sydneysiders the fiasco is sweet revenge. There has been much wailing over what many see as steep ticket prices, an unfair return, some say, for the traffic chaos and disruption predicted in the city during the Games.</p> <p>According to Eyers, tickets had been selling well since the offer was announced at the beginning of last week, but he refused to forecast whether all of the 3.2 million tickets on offer to Australians would be sold.</p> <p>Even the city's well-off are hesitating at the high prices. A front-row seat for the Opening Ceremony on 15 September is priced at \u00a3550. And any Australians desperate to see marathon contestants limp across the finishing line will be charged the same price.</p> <p>Best seats for the ever popular men's 4x100m relay final are \u00a3194, for the women's 200m backstroke final \u00a3182, and for the Men's 10m platform diving final \u00a3142. Less popular disciplines such as the archery final are selling for \u00a326. Even Greco-Roman wrestling is \u00a322.</p> <p>The cheapest ticket in town is for the clash between baseball giants South Korea and Cuba on 19 September. These are available for a mere \u00a34.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As tickets for the Olympics start to go on sale, the hot favourite is a seat to see Cathy Freeman, the 26-year-old Aboriginal runner from Mackay, Queensland, who is the Commonwealth 400 metres title holder. Sydney's sport-mad dashed to buy last Sunday's papers which all had competing Olympic ticket offers. But the day got far more exciting when more than 12,000 tickets for Freeman's first run on 22 September were, by accident, quoted at half-price. Freeman first grabbed the nation's attention in 1994, when after a win she ran a victory lap draped in both the Australian and Aboriginal flags. So when more than 8,000 A-list tickets (the best seats in the house) for the first round of the women's 400m were priced at A$85 (\u00a334) instead of the correct price of A$165 (\u00a366), the hotlines lit up. The 2,400 B-list seats (at either end of the oval stadium) were selling at \u00a326 rather than \u00a350. The 2,000 category C tickets (upper tiers) were a snip at \u00a318 instead of \u00a342. The Sydney Olympic organising committee, Socog, could lose up to $1m (\u00a3400,000) in the pricing fiasco. Its deputy chief executive, Michael Eyers, confessed his mistake to the Sydney press and promised the organisation would stand by the prices quoted. 'We are bound by that, so the people who ordered them will get the tickets for the price advertised.' It has not yet emerged how the tickets for Freeman's session came to be mispriced, but to Sydneysiders the fiasco is sweet revenge. There has been much wailing over what many see as steep ticket prices, an unfair return, some say, for the traffic chaos and disruption predicted in the city during the Games. According to Eyers, tickets had been selling well since the offer was announced at the beginning of last week, but he refused to forecast whether all of the 3.2 million tickets on offer to Australians would be sold. Even the city's well-off are hesitating at the high prices. A front-row seat for the Opening Ceremony on 15 September is priced at \u00a3550. And any Australians desperate to see marathon contestants limp across the finishing line will be charged the same price. Best seats for the ever popular men's 4x100m relay final are \u00a3194, for the women's 200m backstroke final \u00a3182, and for the Men's 10m platform diving final \u00a3142. Less popular disciplines such as the archery final are selling for \u00a326. Even Greco-Roman wrestling is \u00a322. The cheapest ticket in town is for the clash between baseball giants South Korea and Cuba on 19 September. These are available for a mere \u00a34.",

The lanky, languid author was still relatively unknown in America and De Beauvoir was already a celebrity. She had also been Sartre's lover and partner - in a famously 'open' relationship - for more than a decade.</p> <p>Algren, who was later to win awards for his hard-bitten tales of Chicago lowlife and his novel, The Man with the Golden Arm , courted her with a tour of his native city, including heroin addicts and the electric chair, before taking her back to his squalid flat for a night of sex. There, De Beauvoir revealed to a later biographer, she had her first 'complete orgasm'.</p> <p>For the next 17 years they wrote to each other frequently, sometimes four or five times a week. The letters, all in English, are passionate. Algren is De Beauvoir's 'own big crocodile' and she called herself his 'loving little frog'.</p> <p>However, it was a fraught relationship. Both lovers refused to sacrifice much of their lifestyles. Simone de Beauvoir remained rooted in the Parisian intellectual milieu that she loved and Algren, who refused even to learn any French, was loath to leave the United States. But they did go for one romantic trip to Latin America together.</p> <p>Attenborough said that he has discovered the pair actually went through some kind of marriage ceremony in Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.</p> <p>De Beauvoir told Sartre that she was leaving him permanently to live in Chicago with Algren, but in the end could not bring herself to leave Paris.</p> <p>Algren, who was repeatedly unfaithful, broke off the relationship in 1964.</p> <p>He was deeply angered by the way De Beauvoir had used their love affair as material in her books. Though she stayed with Sartre, De Beauvoir died wearing Algren's ring.</p> <p>For the French, De Beauvoir is still a controversial figure. For decades - as French thought and politics veered away from orthodox Marxist analysis - those tainted by any perceived loyalty to the Left were shunned. Now, however, Sartre is a hero again. His picture adorns caf\u00e9s and newspaper stalls and contemporary thinkers pay homage to his ideas.</p> <p>But plans in Paris to rename the square outside Les Deux Magots - the Existentialists' favourite caf\u00e9 - as the Place Sartre-De Beauvoir have met with a mixed reaction.</p> <p>One source at the Institut Fran\u00e7ais in London, who did not want to be named, was adamant in her opposition to the idea. 'It would be a great pity. It would ignore too many other people. And who reads the Existentialists any more anyway?'</p> <p>According to Attenborough, American financiers share her attitude. 'It's French and it involves philosophers, so they are terrified. But I'll do what I always do and keep going. Hopefully we'll start filming next year.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jason.burke@observer.co.uk\">jason.burke@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Algren, who was later to win awards for his hard-bitten tales of Chicago lowlife and his novel, The Man with the Golden Arm , courted her with a tour of his native city, including heroin addicts and the electric chair, before taking her back to his squalid flat for a night of sex. There, De Beauvoir revealed to a later biographer, she had her first 'complete orgasm'. For the next 17 years they wrote to each other frequently, sometimes four or five times a week. The letters, all in English, are passionate. Algren is De Beauvoir's 'own big crocodile' and she called herself his 'loving little frog'. However, it was a fraught relationship. Both lovers refused to sacrifice much of their lifestyles. Simone de Beauvoir remained rooted in the Parisian intellectual milieu that she loved and Algren, who refused even to learn any French, was loath to leave the United States. But they did go for one romantic trip to Latin America together. Attenborough said that he has discovered the pair actually went through some kind of marriage ceremony in Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. De Beauvoir told Sartre that she was leaving him permanently to live in Chicago with Algren, but in the end could not bring herself to leave Paris. Algren, who was repeatedly unfaithful, broke off the relationship in 1964. He was deeply angered by the way De Beauvoir had used their love affair as material in her books. Though she stayed with Sartre, De Beauvoir died wearing Algren's ring. For the French, De Beauvoir is still a controversial figure. For decades - as French thought and politics veered away from orthodox Marxist analysis - those tainted by any perceived loyalty to the Left were shunned. Now, however, Sartre is a hero again. His picture adorns caf\u00e9s and newspaper stalls and contemporary thinkers pay homage to his ideas. But plans in Paris to rename the square outside Les Deux Magots - the Existentialists' favourite caf\u00e9 - as the Place Sartre-De Beauvoir have met with a mixed reaction. One source at the Institut Fran\u00e7ais in London, who did not want to be named, was adamant in her opposition to the idea. 'It would be a great pity. It would ignore too many other people. And who reads the Existentialists any more anyway?' According to Attenborough, American financiers share her attitude. 'It's French and it involves philosophers, so they are terrified. But I'll do what I always do and keep going. Hopefully we'll start filming next year.' jason.burke@observer.co.uk",

In fact, only one Britney-penned song has made it to record so far. 'Dear Diary', the last song on the new album, is a sugary little ballad decked out with strings, chimes and every sentimental clich\u00e9 in pop's palette. 'Dear diary, today I saw a boy,' trills Britney, 'And I wondered if he noticed me...' Probably not, Britney.

I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming... but I wanted more.' </p> <p>In other pictures she seems almost preternaturally mature.

Here comes thirtysomething Camilla in her ice-blue shift dress, looking rather like Fiona Shaw might look if she lived in Fulham and wore Gina mules. A well-to-do Montessori teacher, perhaps, or the director of a small art gallery? Not exactly. Ask a few questions and it emerges that her busiest months are May, June and December, when she's booked solid every night. It's not unknown for her to cram four into a single evening. Overall, she thinks she fits in around 200 a year. What are we talking about? Parties, of course.</p> <p>As the social editor of Harpers &amp; Queen, the 'Jennifer' of Jennifer's Diary, Camilla Cecil (she's an Hon, naturally) toils doggedly at the coalface of the Season, a miner working a seam rich in Krug and seeded wontons. Because Camilla's water-cooler moments happen at Gloucestershire weddings, or eighteenth-birthday parties in the Highlands, or in the royal enclosure at Ascot, she is ideally qualified to write a guide to party-giving.</p> <p>The Harpers &amp; Queen Party Book, however, is written for a very particular sort of person who wants to give a very particular sort of party. It's aimed at people who worry about how much space One should allow per wedding guest (four to six square feet for a drinks reception; 10 if there's a sit-down meal), and what sort of flooring is best if One is hosting a dance for 600 (oak parquet). It is a glimpse into an extraordinarily tense parallel universe, in which Fun and Frivolity are attended by a long line of thumb-twiddling, beady-eyed Fates.</p> <p>Much of the advice is sensible, even obvious. Wedding lists get a big yes ('A list is there as a guideline for the guests, not as an extravagant wish-list from a spoilt couple'); any party snack that comes on a cocktail stick a resounding no ('Where are you supposed to put it?'). In addition, there are lists of tried-and-tested caterers, chair-hire companies and childrens' entertainers.</p> <p>On the other hand, One does have to wonder about the sort of person who frets about where to store visitors' umbrellas ('A dustbin is OK for this') or lies awake at night dreading the possibility that a guest might bring a bottle of wine to dinner ('You then develop selective amnesia and leave it in the fridge'), rather than hoping, rather desperately, that they will.</p> <p>Preparation is all. And by preparation, Harpers &amp; Queen does not mean a freezer full of vodka and a bumper tub of Safeway's taramasalata. No, we are talking linen napkins tied with ivy, birch twigs sprayed silver and pats of butter on terracotta tiles. From the host's perspective, entertaining - drinks parties, children's birthday parties, dinner parties - seems to be primarily about fretting over the tiniest of details for months beforehand, and, second, about having a laugh and passing out, with purple teeth, in a pile of coats. Whoops! What I meant to say was: and second, making sure everyone else has a splendid evening and that you treat yourself to a big, medicinal whisky once they've all gone home.</p> <p>'The best parties,' Camilla tells me over tea in a London hotel, 'are planned with military precision but go off without a hitch, and the ones where you can't see the joins are the ones that most thought has gone into. If people throw it all together and hope it works, most of the time it won't.' Camilla, who seems like a jolly sort of person, says that she has used the book to address the questions that H&amp;Q readers frequently put to her over the phone. They treat her like a social agony aunt, ringing up to ask whether it's U or non-U to serve elderflower press\u00e9 this year, or whether you should take your gloves off at mealtimes. She insists that most of the queries are very sensible, but even she must despair when, in the dinner-party section, she is required to answer the question 'How Do I Invite the Guests' ('A quick telephone call is always the simplest'). Surely, this is slightly tragic? 'No, I don't think so,' says Camilla. 'Yes, a lot of it is very obvious. But there's always the hope that someone will find it useful. It's mostly good practical advice.'</p> <p>So she really never wants to scream: 'Oh, for goodness' sake, just get a life' ?</p> <p>'If I think that, I say it. And I do say to people, \"I'm sure that really doesn't matter.\" A lot of the time, I don't think it does. It was all very well for our parents and grandparents to live life in a certain way, according to certain rules, but it was awfully time-consuming, and we've all got busy lives. No, I never mind the daffy requests. I'm always surprised that people have the intelligence to ring me in the first place. It's a very easy way of getting information.'</p> <p>Not that Camilla can help with every social dilemma. 'I did have a bit of a problem with one woman who telephoned me and started shouting because I couldn't give her a ticket to the royal enclosure at Ascot. She said, \"But who can give it to me if you can't?\" So I said, \"The Queen. I can't, I'm so sorry\".'</p> <p>Let's get down to basics. There are some golden rules about party-giving. 'If you're sitting, the seating plan is absolutely paramount,' says Camilla. 'I once went to an absolutely beautiful party and I had two people on either side who didn't speak any English. That, unfortunately for me, was my lasting memory of an otherwise fabulous party. And make sure the alcohol tastes good and flows. It doesn't have to be champagne. Have a nice white wine, or do a cocktail, which can be cheaper. Parties always get going when people have had a few drinks. And relax - have a nice time. It would be a bit of a waste to forget to enjoy yourself. Look good. It helps. If you run upstairs just before people are due to arrive and whip off your sweatshirt, you just don't feel prepared, whereas if you feel scrubbed and brushed up, it makes you feel better.'</p> <p>I like Camilla and her fresh, confident brand of Mary Poppins correctness. She makes me feel that anything is possible, if you put sufficient effort into it. When she admits that yes, she has been to parties where the alcohol is pooled in a bucket in the kitchen, albeit years ago, I feel able to tell her about my little problem with parties - I hate them. Giving is bad, but taking is even worse. Beforehand, I hover on doorsteps for entire half-hours, plucking up the courage to ring the bell. Once in, I sequester myself in the loo with a pile of old Vogues or National Geographics , ignoring the frantic knockings. Should the loo already be occupied, I loiter at the edge of rooms, either too sober or worse, much worse, too drunk to participate at the appropriate level. How, I ask Camilla, can I overcome my phobia? How can I arrive at a party in the right frame of mind? Camilla has some advice. 'Whenever I'm getting dressed or in the car driving to a party, I'll whack on some Bruce Springsteen to get me in a good mood.'</p> <p>I'm not quite sure that this will do the trick for me, but Camilla has moved on and is thoughtfully matching my confession with one of her own. She is allergic to fish, but because she was always frightened that hostesses might insist on making her scrambled eggs if she mentioned this at the dining table, 'I used to always eat it and then I'd spend the whole evening rushing off and being sick.'</p> <p>Then she met the man who is now her husband and he laughed and laughed about it. So now she owns up straight away, but is very firm, insisting she'll be fine with veg and potatoes. 'At that point I realised, life is too short. Parties are supposed to be fun .'</p> <p>Well, she would say that, wouldn't she?</p> <p><b> To order Harpers &amp; Queen Party Book for \u00a311.95 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171</b></p>",

'If you're sitting, the seating plan is absolutely paramount,' says Camilla. 'I once went to an absolutely beautiful party and I had two people on either side who didn't speak any English. That, unfortunately for me, was my lasting memory of an otherwise fabulous party. And make sure the alcohol tastes good and flows. It doesn't have to be champagne. Have a nice white wine, or do a cocktail, which can be cheaper. Parties always get going when people have had a few drinks. And relax - have a nice time. It would be a bit of a waste to forget to enjoy yourself. Look good. It helps. If you run upstairs just before people are due to arrive and whip off your sweatshirt, you just don't feel prepared, whereas if you feel scrubbed and brushed up, it makes you feel better.' I like Camilla and her fresh, confident brand of Mary Poppins correctness. She makes me feel that anything is possible, if you put sufficient effort into it. When she admits that yes, she has been to parties where the alcohol is pooled in a bucket in the kitchen, albeit years ago, I feel able to tell her about my little problem with parties - I hate them. Giving is bad, but taking is even worse. Beforehand, I hover on doorsteps for entire half-hours, plucking up the courage to ring the bell. Once in, I sequester myself in the loo with a pile of old Vogues or National Geographics , ignoring the frantic knockings. Should the loo already be occupied, I loiter at the edge of rooms, either too sober or worse, much worse, too drunk to participate at the appropriate level. How, I ask Camilla, can I overcome my phobia? How can I arrive at a party in the right frame of mind? Camilla has some advice. 'Whenever I'm getting dressed or in the car driving to a party, I'll whack on some Bruce Springsteen to get me in a good mood.' I'm not quite sure that this will do the trick for me, but Camilla has moved on and is thoughtfully matching my confession with one of her own. She is allergic to fish, but because she was always frightened that hostesses might insist on making her scrambled eggs if she mentioned this at the dining table, 'I used to always eat it and then I'd spend the whole evening rushing off and being sick.' Then she met the man who is now her husband and he laughed and laughed about it. So now she owns up straight away, but is very firm, insisting she'll be fine with veg and potatoes. 'At that point I realised, life is too short. Parties are supposed to be fun .' Well, she would say that, wouldn't she?

Suddenly, the tidied-up industrial space has become as much the conventional gallery form as the Greek temple used to be. The people who put up those brown, motorway heritage signs will have to rethink the stylised representation of the pediment and columns they use to warn us that there is a museum ahead. The conventional sign for a gallery is now Tate Modern's chimney. </p> <p>But the Bankside effect will go wider than just the art world. Herzog and de Meuron have demonstrated that austere, serious-minded, grown-up architecture, designed by architects who are neither apologetic about their work, nor who feel the need to ingratiate themselves with their audience, can have real popular appeal. </p> <p>What makes Tate Modern work is that its architects have had the confidence to do a few, very simple things brilliantly well. The light in the galleries is beautiful. The turbine hall, its proportions intensified by excavating the floor down into what was the basement, is truly heroic. And for what is fundamentally a Swiss building, the timber floors, the expanses of unpretentious concrete, and the bricks make it surprisingly tactile. This kind of thing is much more difficult to do than it looks, as other museums that have struggled to tame relics of the industrial revolution no less imposing than Bankside have discovered. In Madrid, the Reina Sofia, which now holds Picasso's Guernica , has still not managed to shake off the grey, institutional feel of the original hospital. And Gae Aulenti's Busby Berkeley insertions in the Gare d'Orsay crush the impressionists into visual insignificance. </p> <p>Herzog and de Meuron have accepted the logic of the building, with its sparse finishes and made it into something it never was - a public building. A new entrance has been pierced in the west wall and the old machine hall is set to become London's indoor version of the square in front of the Pompidou. 'We don't want to shock people, or overwhelm them,' says Jacques Herzog. 'You accept the existing building as an artificial landscape. Why should you demolish a mountain? Our strategy was to make it a public building.' </p> <p>Bankside also represents a significant shift in the way that architects deal with old buildings. The conventional approach has been deliberately to play up the tension between new and old, to contrast mellow brick with glittering, hi-tech insertions that look like jewellery. Herzog and de Meuron don't buy that. They aren't interested in the archaeology of Gilbert Scott's flimsy brickwork. They have just cleaned it up, and integrated it with their own work. There are new window and door openings, but you can't really tell which is old and which is new. The result is that on the exterior, you are not really aware of just how much the building has been changed - it has become all Herzog and de Meuron. Yet despite its architectural Calvinism, Bankside has seduced everyone who has seen it. The light, the river, the space make an immediate impression. </p> <p>Now that it's finished, complete with the little tip of light on top of the chimney, it's hard to see how else it could have been done. Of course, the Tate should divide its collection between modern and British. Of course, it should move its modern collection away from Millbank. And, of course, it should be in Bankside. It wasn't always that way. The Millennium Commissioners who put up much of the cash needed careful persuasion. At least one of the them, Simon Jenkins, was far from convinced that the old power station would make a plausible art gallery.

      "body": "<p><strong> Bob Dylan, Hanns Martin Schleyer Halle, Stuttgart </strong></p> <p> Germany still boasts more moustaches per capita than any country in the free world, so it was no surprise to find them out in force and twitching expectantly last week for the second day of the latest European leg of Bob Dylan's never-ending mission to visit every town on the planet, a tour that has famously been ongoing since records of blond facial hair began. </p> <p>Last year he was out there playing 120 shows. This man will be 59 next week. He should be at home getting supermodels pregnant. Whatever happened to the old reclusive, unavailable Dylan? </p> <p>I remember desperately queuing halfway round London all night to buy a ticket for one of his 1978 shows - the first in the UK since his notorious 1966 stopover when the duffel coat police sent him home with a flea in both ears for playing an electric guitar. What excitement it was to have him back! He packed Earl's Court six times - I couldn't believe my luck at actually being there, four miles from the stage, standing on my seat holding a cigarette lighter in the air, and... yes, OK, sporting a junior moustache of my own. </p> <p>But who, back then, could have guessed that for the next 20 years Bob would be turning up on the world's doorstep every five minutes like a milkman with amnesia. Having said that, no UK dates have been set for this year, though some are expected to be announced in the autumn. Hence, hello Stuttgart, a city striking for the craftsmanship of its roofing contractors. </p> <p>Dylan comes shambling on stage like a man wandering into a Las Vegas wedding reception: white suit, cowboy boots, suspicion of a perm (long-gone is the unruly, gravity-defying beehive of Don't Look Back ). The band - a pared-down unit of acoustic guitars, drums, stand-up bass - strap themselves in and roar off with a hootin' country song no one normal has remotely heard of about gamblin', rovin' and skirt-chasin' before plunging into an enthusiastic 'reworking' of 'The Times They Are A-Changin', which gets a roar of approval once the audience realises what on earth it is. A handful of early classics follow in lightning succession - 'Desolation Row', 'Tangled Up In Blue', 'Gates of Eden', 'Girl from the North Country'. </p> <p>It's an efficient, crowd-pleasing set, consisting almost wholly of old faves, which won't harm sales of his latest 'best of' album, out this week, though it's a pity Bob finds room for only three songs from his last studio release, the bluesily atmospheric Time Out Of Mind (1997), trumpeted by all as his finest since Blood On The Tracks in the mid-Seventies - which admittedly says as much about the poverty of his output in the intervening period as anything else. But songs such as 'Love Sick' and 'Not Dark Yet' were strong evidence of a return to form, as is the pounding acoustic 'Things Have Changed', a track written for the forthcoming Michael Douglas film Wonder Boys, and included on the new compilation - though Dylan doesn't sing that tonight either. </p> <p>His voice is in good shape, despite the tendency to Waitsian gruffness that he's developed down the years. His stage presence, meanwhile... well, it hasn't got any worse. He prowls around, crouching a bit, waggling his foot occasionally, lurching sideways as if to tease some sign of life from the band, who seem content to spend the evening looking at each other's shoes. </p> <p>The venue doesn't help - an ugly 6,000-seater velodrome shaped like a set of lower dentures. A lot of people have drifted out of their seats, leaving huge cavities around the rear molar area, to join the crowd in front of the stage and creating the impression of a very popular car boot sale. Still, you don't come to a Bob Dylan concert for drama - though we are quick to show our appreciation when any unsought-for excitement comes our way: a ripple of applause every time the curtains change colour, a thunderous cheer for Bob's harmonica, which is as barmy as ever. Even uninteresting guitar solos are greeted with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for ice-dancers executing a difficult jump. </p> <p>Bob doesn't play any of his stuff from the Eighties, which in itself is enough to get my vote. One of his less smart career moves as a rock legend was to come out as a born-again Christian and devote himself to God, who returned the compliment by removing his talent and making him write Slow Train Coming and the execrable Saved. I don't mind if a chap wants to go to church in his spare time, but you don't need forensic knowledge of Cliff Richard to realise that religion is to rock'n'roll what a bucket of cold water is to sex. </p> <p>But ultimately how much you can get from a Dylan concert these days depends on how much you mind him boiling down the original melodies to an extemporised version using fewer notes and less time to sing them in; whether it bothers you to hear him rattling through your favourite lines like a cattle auctioneer late for an appointment; whether having to identify songs from the chords is such a terrible thing or all part of the fun; whether the pump still works when the vandals take the handles. </p> <p>Granted, you might not be disappointed if you'd never heard a Dylan song in your life and had just to come and see the great man in the flesh. And the band rocks through the set, nicely balanced between acoustic and electric - even the lead guitarist eventually manages to make proper use of his long hair, obligingly turning into vintage Bon Jovi during 'Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat'. And the bar is open throughout for jugs of beer and those giant varnished pretzel things made of sawdust. </p> <p>But if one of the highlights of your personal pop history is having the hairs on the back of your neck stand up every time you hear the swirl of organ and the words 'How does it feel...' from 'Like A Rolling Stone' then all you can do is sit here and count the number of times Dylan fails to deliver the genuine article. What is he up to? Maybe the old tunes have wandered out of his vocal range, though that seems unlikely. Perhaps he just doesn't want to go through life jumping through hoops of his own making. Whatever, I can't believe I'm the only one who feels like leaping on stage and singing the bloody thing myself. </p> <p>So in the end I don't stand on my chair, though I do my share of drinking too much beer and whooping. There is no encore to speak of - Dylan divides his set into 12 songs, followed by a bonus six, and then gets someone to turn the lights on to stop us clamouring for more. Not that anybody does. Perhaps we are pleasantly surprised that there is still some evening left to catch a spot of late supper, followed by a stroll and a lap-dancing show. Dylan, of course, has already left the building and is on the bus to Oberhausen - keeping on keeping on, as he used to say.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bob Dylan, Hanns Martin Schleyer Halle, Stuttgart Germany still boasts more moustaches per capita than any country in the free world, so it was no surprise to find them out in force and twitching expectantly last week for the second day of the latest European leg of Bob Dylan's never-ending mission to visit every town on the planet, a tour that has famously been ongoing since records of blond facial hair began. Last year he was out there playing 120 shows. This man will be 59 next week. He should be at home getting supermodels pregnant. Whatever happened to the old reclusive, unavailable Dylan? I remember desperately queuing halfway round London all night to buy a ticket for one of his 1978 shows - the first in the UK since his notorious 1966 stopover when the duffel coat police sent him home with a flea in both ears for playing an electric guitar. What excitement it was to have him back! He packed Earl's Court six times - I couldn't believe my luck at actually being there, four miles from the stage, standing on my seat holding a cigarette lighter in the air, and... yes, OK, sporting a junior moustache of my own. But who, back then, could have guessed that for the next 20 years Bob would be turning up on the world's doorstep every five minutes like a milkman with amnesia. Having said that, no UK dates have been set for this year, though some are expected to be announced in the autumn. Hence, hello Stuttgart, a city striking for the craftsmanship of its roofing contractors. Dylan comes shambling on stage like a man wandering into a Las Vegas wedding reception: white suit, cowboy boots, suspicion of a perm (long-gone is the unruly, gravity-defying beehive of Don't Look Back ). The band - a pared-down unit of acoustic guitars, drums, stand-up bass - strap themselves in and roar off with a hootin' country song no one normal has remotely heard of about gamblin', rovin' and skirt-chasin' before plunging into an enthusiastic 'reworking' of 'The Times They Are A-Changin', which gets a roar of approval once the audience realises what on earth it is. A handful of early classics follow in lightning succession - 'Desolation Row', 'Tangled Up In Blue', 'Gates of Eden', 'Girl from the North Country'. It's an efficient, crowd-pleasing set, consisting almost wholly of old faves, which won't harm sales of his latest 'best of' album, out this week, though it's a pity Bob finds room for only three songs from his last studio release, the bluesily atmospheric Time Out Of Mind (1997), trumpeted by all as his finest since Blood On The Tracks in the mid-Seventies - which admittedly says as much about the poverty of his output in the intervening period as anything else. But songs such as 'Love Sick' and 'Not Dark Yet' were strong evidence of a return to form, as is the pounding acoustic 'Things Have Changed', a track written for the forthcoming Michael Douglas film Wonder Boys, and included on the new compilation - though Dylan doesn't sing that tonight either. His voice is in good shape, despite the tendency to Waitsian gruffness that he's developed down the years. His stage presence, meanwhile... well, it hasn't got any worse. He prowls around, crouching a bit, waggling his foot occasionally, lurching sideways as if to tease some sign of life from the band, who seem content to spend the evening looking at each other's shoes. The venue doesn't help - an ugly 6,000-seater velodrome shaped like a set of lower dentures. A lot of people have drifted out of their seats, leaving huge cavities around the rear molar area, to join the crowd in front of the stage and creating the impression of a very popular car boot sale. Still, you don't come to a Bob Dylan concert for drama - though we are quick to show our appreciation when any unsought-for excitement comes our way: a ripple of applause every time the curtains change colour, a thunderous cheer for Bob's harmonica, which is as barmy as ever. Even uninteresting guitar solos are greeted with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for ice-dancers executing a difficult jump. Bob doesn't play any of his stuff from the Eighties, which in itself is enough to get my vote. One of his less smart career moves as a rock legend was to come out as a born-again Christian and devote himself to God, who returned the compliment by removing his talent and making him write Slow Train Coming and the execrable Saved. I don't mind if a chap wants to go to church in his spare time, but you don't need forensic knowledge of Cliff Richard to realise that religion is to rock'n'roll what a bucket of cold water is to sex. But ultimately how much you can get from a Dylan concert these days depends on how much you mind him boiling down the original melodies to an extemporised version using fewer notes and less time to sing them in; whether it bothers you to hear him rattling through your favourite lines like a cattle auctioneer late for an appointment; whether having to identify songs from the chords is such a terrible thing or all part of the fun; whether the pump still works when the vandals take the handles. Granted, you might not be disappointed if you'd never heard a Dylan song in your life and had just to come and see the great man in the flesh. And the band rocks through the set, nicely balanced between acoustic and electric - even the lead guitarist eventually manages to make proper use of his long hair, obligingly turning into vintage Bon Jovi during 'Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat'. And the bar is open throughout for jugs of beer and those giant varnished pretzel things made of sawdust. But if one of the highlights of your personal pop history is having the hairs on the back of your neck stand up every time you hear the swirl of organ and the words 'How does it feel...' from 'Like A Rolling Stone' then all you can do is sit here and count the number of times Dylan fails to deliver the genuine article. What is he up to? Maybe the old tunes have wandered out of his vocal range, though that seems unlikely. Perhaps he just doesn't want to go through life jumping through hoops of his own making. Whatever, I can't believe I'm the only one who feels like leaping on stage and singing the bloody thing myself. So in the end I don't stand on my chair, though I do my share of drinking too much beer and whooping. There is no encore to speak of - Dylan divides his set into 12 songs, followed by a bonus six, and then gets someone to turn the lights on to stop us clamouring for more. Not that anybody does. Perhaps we are pleasantly surprised that there is still some evening left to catch a spot of late supper, followed by a stroll and a lap-dancing show. Dylan, of course, has already left the building and is on the bus to Oberhausen - keeping on keeping on, as he used to say.",

Wise folk are bucking the trend and doing their own thing on a more modest and rational scale. You can devise your own personal and idiosyncratic way of making your commitment to each other. Maybe the more private the compact, the more durable it will prove. Readers replies GB's immediate dilemma is perhaps the least of her concerns and its resolution would still leave a number of issues outstanding. The problem as stated is as interesting for what is omitted as for what is said. The roots of her partner's desire for a legal form of marriage may lie in some desire for security, possibly indicating past betrayal and the need for some formal statement of commitment. More ominously, it may be the attribution to his partner of some deeper-seated insecurity or doubt in his own level of commitment. GB also states that her partner wants them to have the same name, which immediately poses the question 'which name?', although the underlying assumption is that it will be his, perhaps, indicating 'ownership' of his partner. His wishes seem strange at a time when increasing numbers of women retain their own names after marriage and when the law recognises many aspects of shared lives regardless of marital status. That GB's partner has persisted with these views for five years suggests that she and her partner should resolve underlying issues about trust and security before contemplating marriage. R.T. of Cheshire Since G.B.'s partner is the one who wants both himself and his partner to have the same surname, I assume that he intends to take her surname. If so he can change it by deed-poll. Marriage is not required and if both partners have the same surname, it will be socially assumed. There are considerable financial advantages to being legally married, providing that both partners are certain that this is the person they want to spend the rest of their lives with: pension rights, inheritance rights and unchallengeable community property rights. The major advantage of not being legally married is that it makes ending the relationship very much simpler.

He has done so tantalisingly, directing his own adaptation of a 1948 play by Jean-Paul Sartre. Les Mains Sales - The Novice in Eyre's version - is a study of political commitment, cast in the form of a thriller. </p> <p>It's an occasion with a lot of allure and electricity. On the stage of the Almeida a woman - chic, moony and motionless - sits among shadows as the audience enters: the glamorous gloom of film noir seeps into the theatre before a word is said. The action, set in an imaginary land, features a clash between principle and pragmatism in political life: its discussions are perennially applicable to public affairs. The plot has sufficient suspense and twists to propel the play's themes: a young middle-class revolutionary (Jamie Glover, whose lover, Jessica, is played by Natasha Little) is contracted to kill his rough-diamond party chief, who is on the point of forming an alliance with liberals and a right-wing aristocracy; the would-be assassin dithers. And at the centre is a performance by Kenneth Cranham, as the party boss, of such explosive impact - the sandpaper voice, the butting forehead and, most important, the total conviction which surges through each speech - that you almost believe these debates are urgent. </p> <p>They aren't. This is an interesting snapshot of Sartre's mind in the late Forties, but there are no revelations. The central moral dilemma - should you compromise in order to get power? - though general enough to seem pertinent to current political anxieties, is heavily dependent for its expression on the circumstances and vocabulary - proletarian, bourgeois, intellectual, fascist - of postwar France. </p> <p>The entwining of this dilemma with a theme of sexual anxiety makes the play not more complex but less condensed: it begins to sound like the anguished musings of a man who can't make up his mind whether to go to bed with a woman or throw a grenade. And there are throughout too many redundant formulations, too many pointlessly repeated words - 'No, Olga, No', 'Why did you come here, why?'. These conversations too often strain for significance. This is a production that makes Sartre look more intriguing, but hardly adds to his stature as a thinker. </p> <p>The dream of a liberating murder also fills the black and stony heart of Mr Kolpert, the contribution of the German playwright David Gieselmann to the Royal Court's international playwrights' season. But Gieselmann's dream is shorn of any political or social dimension, and stripped of explanation. It is also wired with a sense of humour - David Tushingham's translation must be due some praise here - which switchbacks from the po-faced to the riotous. </p> <p>Richard Wilson - yes, you do believe it - is soaring as a director. And in this short play he tackles real weirdness. A young couple - whose conversation is artificial to the point of eeriness - invites another couple round for the evening. They announce that they've killed a colleague and stuffed the body in a trunk, which is placed in the middle of the stage. At this point the audience may think they are being thrown a line to Patrick Hamilton's Rope . </p> <p>Then the couple say they were joking. Then the guests show themselves to be at least as unpredictable and violent as their hosts. Then, in the most deadpan, frightening and funny sequence of the play, all four - enigmatic and sleek Amanda Drew, placid and alarming Adam Godley, meek and terrifying Melanie Ramsay, bovine and raging Darren Boyd - sit around eating pizza and behaving as if they were sipping tea at a vicarage. And then everything goes bananas: Julian McGowan's witty white design ends up spattered with gore. </p> <p>It's the bold slipping and sliding from one kind of improbability to another which makes Mr Kolpert gripping and unusual.

The cycle of Shakespeare's Histories is indispensable, and last month a hit was added to the repertoire with Lynne Parker's buoyant Forties' production of The Comedy of Errors on the main stage.

Across Blaithin Sheerin's tawny Mediterranean design - which manages to look at once vivid and grimy - a procession of characters glide like mechanical toys. There's a nun with a headdress like a meringue, a jaunty fellow in a panama, a sinister mackintoshed lurker. In this tale of the confusions wrought by two pairs of identical twins, all individuality is precarious - sometimes just a matter of putting on a different hat. This is not a play which will transport an audience with the power of its language. It does, however, have one memorable description of a dissolving identity: 'I to the world am like a drop of water/That in the ocean seeks another drop.' </p> <p>And it has recurring watery images. The production hints at the wateriness in parodic fashion: a trough stands in the middle of the stage occasionally spouting a miniature fountain. </p> <p>Parker reasonably plays the action as farce: tragedy at the wrong speed. This series of dire events would normally look bleak but performed in swift succession they seem ludicrous - like a bass dirge hurried up. It draws on music hall, silent movies and slapstick: there are funny walks, collapsing props, virtuoso linguistic displays, tours de force of dance. The verse is well-spoken. There are gifted performances from David Tennant as an elastic-limbed, smooth-tongued Antipholus of Syracuse and from Ian Hughes, who makes Tennant's servant into an Italianate Charlie Chaplin. But most striking is the sense of a group of actors playing together, as if they were puppets tugged by a single pair of hands.</p>",

In this tale of the confusions wrought by two pairs of identical twins, all individuality is precarious - sometimes just a matter of putting on a different hat. This is not a play which will transport an audience with the power of its language. It does, however, have one memorable description of a dissolving identity: 'I to the world am like a drop of water/That in the ocean seeks another drop.' And it has recurring watery images. The production hints at the wateriness in parodic fashion: a trough stands in the middle of the stage occasionally spouting a miniature fountain. Parker reasonably plays the action as farce: tragedy at the wrong speed. This series of dire events would normally look bleak but performed in swift succession they seem ludicrous - like a bass dirge hurried up. It draws on music hall, silent movies and slapstick: there are funny walks, collapsing props, virtuoso linguistic displays, tours de force of dance. The verse is well-spoken. There are gifted performances from David Tennant as an elastic-limbed, smooth-tongued Antipholus of Syracuse and from Ian Hughes, who makes Tennant's servant into an Italianate Charlie Chaplin. But most striking is the sense of a group of actors playing together, as if they were puppets tugged by a single pair of hands.",

The soldiers are Arsenal fans in a regiment stationed in the South-West and have caused problems at some of the London side's recent European games. They have played a key role in putting together the six-club coalition.</p> <p>An associate of the soldier gang told The Observer that the invitation to Leeds thugs to join them in Copenhagen was extended after Arsenal beat French side Lens to reach the Uefa Cup Final but Leeds went out to Galatasaray. The soldiers - who call themselves Gooners, the nickname for Arsenal fans - rang the Leeds thugs from a bar in Lens to suggest they help them target Turks in a pan-British revenge mission in Copenhagen.</p> <p>Since then troublemakers from the other four British clubs, including members of the infamous 'Chelsea headhunters' gang, have agreed to join forces.</p> <p>Friendships across club boundaries, forged through following England abroad, involvement in extreme right-wing politics and joint criminal enterprises have thus enabled Arsenal thugs to persuade up to 200 others to help them cause mayhem.</p> <p>One Arsenal hooligan with a history of organising trouble is a close ally of a prominent Chelsea 'headhunter' who has a horrendous record of violence. Although Arsenal fans have a good reputation, the club does have a small hardcore following of around 80 thugs. They have been involved in several outbreaks this season, including fighting at both north London derbies against arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur. When they played Manchester United at Highbury last August, 20 Arsenal hooligans followed one United fan and beat him senseless at a Tube station.</p> <p>Huge security will surround this week's match. British police 'spotters' will alert their Danish colleagues to known hooligans, while the Danes have pledged to ban any fan without a ticket from entering the country.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence said it would investigate plans by any soldiers to go to Copenhagen. A spokesman said: 'This sounds extremely serious and would not be condoned in any way by either the MoD or the civilian police.' Any soldiers known to be intent on causing trouble would be prevented from travelling, he said.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:denis.campbell@observer.co.uk\">denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A bloodthirsty alliance of British hooligans - including serving soldiers - is out to avenge last month's murder of two Leeds fans by provoking violence at Wednesday's Uefa Cup Final, say police. Thugs who are normally bitter rivals have joined forces to plan attacks on fans of Turkish side Galatasaray, who play Arsenal on Wednesday in Copenhagen, following the killing of Kevin Speight and Christopher Loftus in Istanbul last month. Police say up to 200 troublemakers who follow Leeds, Chelsea, Glasgow Rangers, Cardiff City and Swansea City are travelling to Denmark to help Arsenal hooligans assault Turkish fans. The soldiers are Arsenal fans in a regiment stationed in the South-West and have caused problems at some of the London side's recent European games. They have played a key role in putting together the six-club coalition. An associate of the soldier gang told The Observer that the invitation to Leeds thugs to join them in Copenhagen was extended after Arsenal beat French side Lens to reach the Uefa Cup Final but Leeds went out to Galatasaray. The soldiers - who call themselves Gooners, the nickname for Arsenal fans - rang the Leeds thugs from a bar in Lens to suggest they help them target Turks in a pan-British revenge mission in Copenhagen. Since then troublemakers from the other four British clubs, including members of the infamous 'Chelsea headhunters' gang, have agreed to join forces. Friendships across club boundaries, forged through following England abroad, involvement in extreme right-wing politics and joint criminal enterprises have thus enabled Arsenal thugs to persuade up to 200 others to help them cause mayhem. One Arsenal hooligan with a history of organising trouble is a close ally of a prominent Chelsea 'headhunter' who has a horrendous record of violence. Although Arsenal fans have a good reputation, the club does have a small hardcore following of around 80 thugs. They have been involved in several outbreaks this season, including fighting at both north London derbies against arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur. When they played Manchester United at Highbury last August, 20 Arsenal hooligans followed one United fan and beat him senseless at a Tube station. Huge security will surround this week's match. British police 'spotters' will alert their Danish colleagues to known hooligans, while the Danes have pledged to ban any fan without a ticket from entering the country. The Ministry of Defence said it would investigate plans by any soldiers to go to Copenhagen. A spokesman said: 'This sounds extremely serious and would not be condoned in any way by either the MoD or the civilian police.' Any soldiers known to be intent on causing trouble would be prevented from travelling, he said. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

Eleventh-hour evidence is produced by a journalist who lost an arm on a Pacific beach and carries a torch for the accused's Japanese wife. </p> <p>This is factitious stuff that is made watchable by the presence of James Cromwell as the judge and James Rebhorn and Max von Sydow as the competing lawyers.

The title comes from a Daily Mirror headline of 1978 and the film vividly recreates that curious period when Labour lost control and Thatcher was about to take power. You don't have to take Johnny Rotten at his own valuation to think him shrewd and eloquent. 'We stopped at the right time for the wrong reasons,' Rotten concludes. 'Only the fakers survive.' </p> <p>Based on the childhood memoirs of TV executive Denis Forman, <strong> My Life So Far</strong> is a nostalgic look at upper-middle-class Scottish life in the 1920s through the eyes of a precocious, somewhat precious 10-year-old lad living with his mother and eccentric inventor father (Colin Firth) in his grandmother's castle. </p> <p>Things go wrong when a rich, middle-aged uncle (Malcolm McDowell) brings home his alluring young French fianc\u00e9e (Ir\u00e9ne Jacob), but the picture is never involving or moving.

      "body": "<p><strong> Gladiator </strong> (150 mins, 15) Directed by Ridley Scott; starring Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed </p> <p> Britain is a nation that for centuries has dispatched its violently inclined citizens to do their dirty work abroad, in the colonies or, more recently, in Hollywood. Ridley Scott, one of our most gifted directors of commercials and a most impressive exponent of screen violence, has yet to make a movie set in this country. </p> <p>No one could accuse him of being squeamish and his directorial debut in 1977, The Duellists, featured a succession of brutally painful sabre fights between two French officers in the Napoleonic Wars. The extraterrestrial monster leaping from John Hurt's stomach in Alien is among the most shocking moments in movie history, and now in Gladiator, Scott's best film since Thelma and Louise, he's revived the bloodiest of action genres. </p> <p>Roman history was the chief topic of the Italian epics before the First World War, while Mussolini encouraged another wave of such pictures in the Thirties to celebrate his own imperial ambitions. Meanwhile, Hollywood got in on the act with the silent Ben-Hur of 1924. </p> <p>The need to meet the challenge of TV with spectacular entertainments and bigger screens brought about a revival of the costume epic in the Fifties, with new film versions of the Victorian novels Quo Vadis? and Ben-Hur, and pictures based on more recent books such as The Robe and Barabbas, many shot at what became known as Hollywood-on-the-Tiber. </p> <p>They usually contrasted Roman decadence with Christian spirituality, though for all their piety the selling point was brutal combat in the arena rather than prayers in the catacombs. </p> <p>In April 1964, the month Anthony Mann's The Fall of the Roman Empire premiered in London, there also opened with less fanfare five dubbed Italian epics of the sort known in Italy as 'peplums' (named for the short tunics the heroes wore) and elsewhere as sword and sandal sagas, among them Caesar the Conqueror, Battles of the Gladiators and Gladiators Seven. </p> <p>But the glut of such movies and the catastrophic box-office failure of the prestigious, all-star Fall of the Roman Empire brought the cycle to a sudden end. Since then, Christians have been thrown to the lions and Roman legionnaires have marched into battle only for laughs, as in the Asterix comedies and Monty Python's Life of Brian. </p> <p>So here's Ridley Scott in deadly earnest bringing us the most ferocious picture of its kind since Richard Fleischer's Barabbas. But there is no reference to Christianity in Gladiator. It's about the undoing and attempted restoration of civilised values and covers the very events treated in The Fall of the Roman Empire - the death of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 180, his failed attempt to appoint a worthy successor and the disastrous 13-year rule of his corrupt son, Commodus, from which point Gibbon charts the imperial decline. </p> <p>Like Scott, Anthony Mann was a great visual stylist and a master of screen violence. But in The Fall of the Roman Empire, he tried to be too tasteful: before the first blood is shed, there's 45 stately minutes of fancy dialogue between the emperor and his Greek counsellor and beautifully composed shots of a spectacular gathering of regional leaders. </p> <p>Scott doesn't make this mistake. His picture starts with the Roman army on a muddy battlefield near the Danube, straining like greyhounds in the slips to be unleashed on the howling barbarian hordes by their heroic Spanish-born general, Maximus (Russell Crowe). 'What we do in life echoes in eternity,' he tells his troops, establishing the film's principal theme of confronting death and destiny. </p> <p>Suddenly, flaming arrows fly through the air, catapults unleash balls of fire that explode above the enemy. The centurions advance accompanied by the cavalry and a hand-to-hand battle ensues, with Maximus in the vanguard. The rapid editing gives way to slow motion and an elegiac soundtrack. This is a final costly victory for tired, tested men and a knock-out overture. </p> <p>When the battle is over, the effete Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arrives in a Roman equivalent of a movie star's trailer. 'Have I missed the battle?' he asks his father. 'You have missed the war,' says Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris, who has an uncanny resemblance to Alec Guinness in Mann's picture). </p> <p>The functional dialogue is pared down and rarely lapses into old-fashioned Hollywood historic or high-flown Christopher Fry poetic. Marcus wants Maximus, a fictitious character, to succeed him and make Rome a republic again. But Commodus kills his ailing father, sentences Maximus to death for treason and becomes Caesar. </p> <p>From then on, the film pits the decent, civic warrior against the libertine villain, the man who, in Gibbon's words, had 'an aversion to whatever was rational or liberal, and a fond attachment to the amusements of the populace: the sports of the circus and amphitheatre, the combats of gladiators and the hunting of wild beasts'. </p> <p>After turning the tables on his executioners, Maximus embarks on a long voyage home that is like a cross between the travels of Ulysses after the fall of Troy and the travails of Spartacus as slave and enforced gladiator.

      "bodyText": "Gladiator (150 mins, 15) Directed by Ridley Scott; starring Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed Britain is a nation that for centuries has dispatched its violently inclined citizens to do their dirty work abroad, in the colonies or, more recently, in Hollywood. Ridley Scott, one of our most gifted directors of commercials and a most impressive exponent of screen violence, has yet to make a movie set in this country. No one could accuse him of being squeamish and his directorial debut in 1977, The Duellists, featured a succession of brutally painful sabre fights between two French officers in the Napoleonic Wars. The extraterrestrial monster leaping from John Hurt's stomach in Alien is among the most shocking moments in movie history, and now in Gladiator, Scott's best film since Thelma and Louise, he's revived the bloodiest of action genres. Roman history was the chief topic of the Italian epics before the First World War, while Mussolini encouraged another wave of such pictures in the Thirties to celebrate his own imperial ambitions. Meanwhile, Hollywood got in on the act with the silent Ben-Hur of 1924. The need to meet the challenge of TV with spectacular entertainments and bigger screens brought about a revival of the costume epic in the Fifties, with new film versions of the Victorian novels Quo Vadis? and Ben-Hur, and pictures based on more recent books such as The Robe and Barabbas, many shot at what became known as Hollywood-on-the-Tiber. They usually contrasted Roman decadence with Christian spirituality, though for all their piety the selling point was brutal combat in the arena rather than prayers in the catacombs. In April 1964, the month Anthony Mann's The Fall of the Roman Empire premiered in London, there also opened with less fanfare five dubbed Italian epics of the sort known in Italy as 'peplums' (named for the short tunics the heroes wore) and elsewhere as sword and sandal sagas, among them Caesar the Conqueror, Battles of the Gladiators and Gladiators Seven. But the glut of such movies and the catastrophic box-office failure of the prestigious, all-star Fall of the Roman Empire brought the cycle to a sudden end. Since then, Christians have been thrown to the lions and Roman legionnaires have marched into battle only for laughs, as in the Asterix comedies and Monty Python's Life of Brian. So here's Ridley Scott in deadly earnest bringing us the most ferocious picture of its kind since Richard Fleischer's Barabbas. But there is no reference to Christianity in Gladiator. It's about the undoing and attempted restoration of civilised values and covers the very events treated in The Fall of the Roman Empire - the death of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 180, his failed attempt to appoint a worthy successor and the disastrous 13-year rule of his corrupt son, Commodus, from which point Gibbon charts the imperial decline. Like Scott, Anthony Mann was a great visual stylist and a master of screen violence. But in The Fall of the Roman Empire, he tried to be too tasteful: before the first blood is shed, there's 45 stately minutes of fancy dialogue between the emperor and his Greek counsellor and beautifully composed shots of a spectacular gathering of regional leaders. Scott doesn't make this mistake. His picture starts with the Roman army on a muddy battlefield near the Danube, straining like greyhounds in the slips to be unleashed on the howling barbarian hordes by their heroic Spanish-born general, Maximus (Russell Crowe). 'What we do in life echoes in eternity,' he tells his troops, establishing the film's principal theme of confronting death and destiny. Suddenly, flaming arrows fly through the air, catapults unleash balls of fire that explode above the enemy. The centurions advance accompanied by the cavalry and a hand-to-hand battle ensues, with Maximus in the vanguard. The rapid editing gives way to slow motion and an elegiac soundtrack. This is a final costly victory for tired, tested men and a knock-out overture. When the battle is over, the effete Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arrives in a Roman equivalent of a movie star's trailer. 'Have I missed the battle?' he asks his father. 'You have missed the war,' says Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris, who has an uncanny resemblance to Alec Guinness in Mann's picture). The functional dialogue is pared down and rarely lapses into old-fashioned Hollywood historic or high-flown Christopher Fry poetic. Marcus wants Maximus, a fictitious character, to succeed him and make Rome a republic again. But Commodus kills his ailing father, sentences Maximus to death for treason and becomes Caesar. From then on, the film pits the decent, civic warrior against the libertine villain, the man who, in Gibbon's words, had 'an aversion to whatever was rational or liberal, and a fond attachment to the amusements of the populace: the sports of the circus and amphitheatre, the combats of gladiators and the hunting of wild beasts'. After turning the tables on his executioners, Maximus embarks on a long voyage home that is like a cross between the travels of Ulysses after the fall of Troy and the travails of Spartacus as slave and enforced gladiator. It is a journey of revenge that brings him from the dusty eastern fringes of the empire back to a Rome corrupted by Commodus. The movie is at once gloomy and exciting, oppressive and exhilarating, though at times the plot is somewhat puzzling. Its Rome is as grand as that of past movies, but a harder, harsher place, and the succession of battles in the arena are electrifyingly staged, imaginatively varied and increasingly ferocious. Enthralling and appalling, the gladiatorial combat appeals to much that is primitive and atavistic in us, but we experience it through a true hero who has lost everything except his dignity and his will to survive. There are attractive performances from Oliver Reed (as an ex-gladiator turned arena impresario), Derek Jacobi (happily back in a toga as an honest senator 25 years after I Claudius) and the statuesque Djimon Hounsou as the hero's resigned African friend.

Then he disappears, leaving me to wait in a front room that is a cross between an Oxbridge don's study and my little brother's bedroom - precarious piles of books everywhere you look, a slew of post and papers covering the floor, and boys' things - balls and frisbees and baseball stuff - scattered over the chairs.</p> <p>I mooch a bit, examining the books' spines - a mix of the arcane and the newly published - and it doesn't feel at all strange to be here, in Dave Eggers's living room, because, like the thousands of Americans who have bought his memoir, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, I feel as if I have known Eggers for years. </p> <p>Certainly I know more about his life and his family than I do about many of my friends. When Eggers was 21, both his parents died of cancer in the space of 32 days, leaving him to bring up his little brother, Toph (pronounced 'Tofe', short for Christopher), who was eight. A heartbreaking tale, to be sure, but what makes AHWOSG (as the author refers to it throughout his preface) different from the legion of personal memoirs currently flooding bookshops is Eggers's style - deliberately knowing and self-conscious, layer upon layer of irony but also vibrant, energetic and, in spite of the subject matter, splutteringly, rib-clutchingly funny, in a self-mocking sort of way.</p> <p>The book was published in the US in February this year to wildly excited reviews, but its success has largely been through word of mouth; it is still roosting contentedly in the New York Times best-seller lists after 12 weeks and the offers for the film rights are still coming thick and fast. In fact, the person on the other end of the phone when I arrive is a lawyer discussing this very question. </p> <p>We go to a diner around the corner; Eggers is hungover and tired and wants food. He is smaller than I expected, with exuberant hair and what he describes in the book as 'deeply carved laugh lines'; he wears khaki shorts and a T-shirt that look as if they came from LL Bean or The Gap some years ago. When I check his present age, he says: 'Forty-seven. But I've been telling everyone 30.'</p> <p>He talks much as he writes - a forceful stream of consciousness, thoughts sprouting in all directions - but I am saved the challenge of taking notes, as Eggers has agreed to see me in New York on the condition that I do not quote anything he says during this meeting, and that the interview proper must be done by e-mail so that he has time to weigh up his answers. He is still sensitive about publicity, he confides, fearful of being misrepresented, easily upset by unfavourable reviews (though these have been almost non-existent). What follows, then, is a kind of fictionalisation of fact, a compression of different events into the same time frame, and Eggers, I hope, can't help but approve, since it's a technique he has employed - and drawn attention to - to great effect himself. </p> <p>There is an episode in the book in which a well-meaning girl in a bar asks after his brother; Eggers, tired of the same question, replies with an elaborate story about Toph shooting a classmate and then taking off hitch-hiking in the Dakotas, which the unfortunate girl swallows entirely, her shocked sympathy only encouraging Eggers to further fabulation. I wish I had remembered that episode as we have the following conversation: </p> <p> <strong> SM:</strong> How has Toph reacted to the book's success and all the attention? </p> <p> <strong> DE:</strong> (leaning confidentially across his waffle with furtive expression) Well... he doesn't actually know about it yet. To tell the truth, I'm afraid to tell him. Where do you start? I don't know what it might do to him. </p> <p> <strong> SM:</strong> (baffled) But... how could he not have noticed? With the reading tour and the interviews and everything? </p> <p> <strong> DE:</strong> (with an expression at once stoic and sorrowful, tapping his temple) Well, you see - he's in this special school for retarded kids...</p> <p> <strong> SM:</strong> (witlessly open-mouthed) And you left that out of the book?! </p> <p>After watching me flounder for some minutes he says, grinning ruefully, 'you're too easy', and goes on to explain that he won't answer any questions about Toph, who is now 16. 'My talking about him ended, in the book and in public, when he was 13.' </p> <p>He refuses to answer other questions too, those relating to his private life in the present, often simply referring me to the book or giving jokey responses with a straight face, as if to suggest that we already have everything we could want to know about him between hard covers. This seems a curious stance given the extreme candour of the book, but Eggers is as tricky to interview as the book is to review - not because either are deliberately difficult, but quite the reverse. Every question you could devise has already been pre-empted by Eggers himself in the book, including the obvious problems and contradictions inherent in choosing to lay yourself bare in a memoir. 'Maybe writing about actual events,' he muses in the hilarious Acknowledgements section, 'in the first person, if not from Ireland and before you turned 70, was Bad.' </p> <p>So why did he choose to write so bluntly about his parents' deaths? </p> <p>'It's hard to say. I was writing about that winter's events as soon as that spring, while still in college, and I was basically transcribing these scenes straight from my weekends at home. It was creepy. I was creepy. I'm not exactly sure what compelled me to do that, but suffice it to say that I always had the feeling, every day after that winter, that I would someday get it all down.' </p> <p>It was not, he says, a substitute for therapy - 'I can't really equate it with therapy, never having been in or had much faith in therapy.' </p> <p>So what did he hope it might achieve? 'I wished it would do what it appears to have already done,' he replies, deadpan. 'Cure tuberculosis and bring democracy to East Africa.' </p> <p>Eggers grew up in Lake Forest, an affluent town near Chicago (described by a friend in the book as 'a nightmare WASP utopia') with his lawyer father and schoolteacher mother, his two older siblings, Beth and Bill and, later, Toph. His father was an alcoholic, occasionally violent, who determinedly carried on drinking while pretending to his family that he was seeking help: 'The most famous trick was the AA trick, which involved attending AA meetings, in our house even, while a few fingers under.' </p> <p>At times he could be frightening - 'not that he ever hit us all that hard', Eggers writes - but it was his unpredictability that terrified them as children into hiding from his wrath. Eggers describes locking himself in his room and attempting to escape through the window with a sheet tied to the bed as his father pounded furiously on the door. Despite these episodes, their family life appears on the whole to have been happy, but you get the sense that he feels the loss of his mother more keenly - it is her death, her funeral and her memory that dominate his story, while his father is more shadowy, glimpsed in brief scenes. </p> <p>Immediately after the deaths (his father from lung cancer, his mother from stomach cancer), they sold the family home, and Eggers and Toph headed west to California, where Bill was working and Beth was starting law school, brimful of exhilaration and a kind of righteous anger, a feeling that the world owed them a huge debt. Eggers was flung into an unorthodox, experimental parenting with no one to explain the rules. Life is full of food-fights, sock-sliding contests, take-out, mess and unwashed laundry. 'I am making our lives a music video, a game show on Nickelodeon - lots of quick cuts, crazy camera angles, fun, fun, fun!'</p> <p>But behind the fun is an obsessive fear for Toph's safety, an over-compensation that becomes a running joke - this fear that if he lets Toph down in the smallest detail, the boy will grow up 'with an interest in guns and uniforms', or worse. Did the circumstances made him harder on Toph in some ways than his parents might have been? </p> <p>'Well, fearing for his future, as any parent would, is not the same as being strict, which I wasn't. Much of my parents' strategy had to do with trust, and they created a situation where I wanted to reward that trust, and also a place where rebellion would not find the friction it requires. I remember once, after being ragged on for something minor, complaining that I should never be hassled at all, given that I didn't do drugs, wasn't in a gang, etc. And they said what they always said, which was: 'Go ahead, moron - do drugs, join a gang. It's your stupid life.' Which is, I feel, the perfect way to defuse any run-of-the-mill teenage rebellion. Things were similar with Toph and me, though because we're closer in age, there was - and is - even less need for rebellion or punishment.' </p> <p>How would his experience with Toph affect him if he had children of his own, I wondered? </p> <p>Eggers looks serious. He has decided there is something wrong with his bacon. 'Well,' he says, slowly. 'The most important thing I learned is that when your child is eating paint chips, it's almost never healthy. No matter how adorable they look while they're doing it.' </p> <p>The brothers still live together, having moved from San Francisco to New York two years ago when Eggers's idealistic magazine venture, Might, folded. Toph is at high school and Eggers now edits <a href=\"http://www.mcsweeneys.net/\" target=\"_NEW\">McSweeney's</a>, a literary journal run on a shoestring and printed in Iceland ('we figured, why not?'), produced from a tiny room in Eggers's flat, no bigger than a cupboard and waist-deep in post. In spite - or perhaps because - of its policy of not paying contributors, McSweeney's has acquired a reputation as an important forum for new writing, including some of the most sought-after names in American fiction: Rick Moody, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem and George Saunders, among others. </p> <p>Eggers has been portrayed by the American press as supremely unworldly, largely because of reports that he lives in a bedsit and turned down a $2 million offer for the film rights to AHWOSG because he would find a film too upsetting. (It's not a bedsit, by the way. Under the mess, it's quite a substantial apartment in Park Slope, the nicest part of Brooklyn, a short subway ride from central Manhattan.) These reports were pure surmise, he says. If he were to sell film rights, he says, he would give the money to charity, but won't discuss it any further. </p> <p>I ask if he has been surprised by his book's extraordinary success. </p> <p>'Yes, I was surprised. It's a weird book, right? I truly felt, and Toph felt, and most of my friends felt, that it was much too insular and specific and self-indulgent to appeal to anyone outside of our small coterie of friends and family.' </p> <p>So what is it about his story that has captured the imagination of America? </p> <p>He does that serious smile again, leaning forward over the table. </p> <p>'Since it became popular, I've done a lot of thinking about it, and I'm pretty sure the success was due to one factor that no one had kept in mind, though it now seems obvious: my great clothes. I mean, I have really great clothes. And in America, thank God, that counts for something.' </p> <p>\u0095 A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is published by Simon &amp; Schuster, $23, and will be published in the UK by Picador on 30 June at \u00a314.99.</p>",

He talks much as he writes - a forceful stream of consciousness, thoughts sprouting in all directions - but I am saved the challenge of taking notes, as Eggers has agreed to see me in New York on the condition that I do not quote anything he says during this meeting, and that the interview proper must be done by e-mail so that he has time to weigh up his answers. He is still sensitive about publicity, he confides, fearful of being misrepresented, easily upset by unfavourable reviews (though these have been almost non-existent). What follows, then, is a kind of fictionalisation of fact, a compression of different events into the same time frame, and Eggers, I hope, can't help but approve, since it's a technique he has employed - and drawn attention to - to great effect himself. There is an episode in the book in which a well-meaning girl in a bar asks after his brother; Eggers, tired of the same question, replies with an elaborate story about Toph shooting a classmate and then taking off hitch-hiking in the Dakotas, which the unfortunate girl swallows entirely, her shocked sympathy only encouraging Eggers to further fabulation. I wish I had remembered that episode as we have the following conversation: SM: How has Toph reacted to the book's success and all the attention? DE: (leaning confidentially across his waffle with furtive expression) Well... he doesn't actually know about it yet. To tell the truth, I'm afraid to tell him. Where do you start? I don't know what it might do to him. SM: (baffled) But... how could he not have noticed? With the reading tour and the interviews and everything? DE: (with an expression at once stoic and sorrowful, tapping his temple) Well, you see - he's in this special school for retarded kids... SM: (witlessly open-mouthed) And you left that out of the book?! After watching me flounder for some minutes he says, grinning ruefully, 'you're too easy', and goes on to explain that he won't answer any questions about Toph, who is now 16. 'My talking about him ended, in the book and in public, when he was 13.' He refuses to answer other questions too, those relating to his private life in the present, often simply referring me to the book or giving jokey responses with a straight face, as if to suggest that we already have everything we could want to know about him between hard covers. This seems a curious stance given the extreme candour of the book, but Eggers is as tricky to interview as the book is to review - not because either are deliberately difficult, but quite the reverse. Every question you could devise has already been pre-empted by Eggers himself in the book, including the obvious problems and contradictions inherent in choosing to lay yourself bare in a memoir. 'Maybe writing about actual events,' he muses in the hilarious Acknowledgements section, 'in the first person, if not from Ireland and before you turned 70, was Bad.' So why did he choose to write so bluntly about his parents' deaths? 'It's hard to say. I was writing about that winter's events as soon as that spring, while still in college, and I was basically transcribing these scenes straight from my weekends at home. It was creepy. I was creepy. I'm not exactly sure what compelled me to do that, but suffice it to say that I always had the feeling, every day after that winter, that I would someday get it all down.' It was not, he says, a substitute for therapy - 'I can't really equate it with therapy, never having been in or had much faith in therapy.' So what did he hope it might achieve? 'I wished it would do what it appears to have already done,' he replies, deadpan. 'Cure tuberculosis and bring democracy to East Africa.' Eggers grew up in Lake Forest, an affluent town near Chicago (described by a friend in the book as 'a nightmare WASP utopia') with his lawyer father and schoolteacher mother, his two older siblings, Beth and Bill and, later, Toph. His father was an alcoholic, occasionally violent, who determinedly carried on drinking while pretending to his family that he was seeking help: 'The most famous trick was the AA trick, which involved attending AA meetings, in our house even, while a few fingers under.' At times he could be frightening - 'not that he ever hit us all that hard', Eggers writes - but it was his unpredictability that terrified them as children into hiding from his wrath. Eggers describes locking himself in his room and attempting to escape through the window with a sheet tied to the bed as his father pounded furiously on the door. Despite these episodes, their family life appears on the whole to have been happy, but you get the sense that he feels the loss of his mother more keenly - it is her death, her funeral and her memory that dominate his story, while his father is more shadowy, glimpsed in brief scenes. Immediately after the deaths (his father from lung cancer, his mother from stomach cancer), they sold the family home, and Eggers and Toph headed west to California, where Bill was working and Beth was starting law school, brimful of exhilaration and a kind of righteous anger, a feeling that the world owed them a huge debt. Eggers was flung into an unorthodox, experimental parenting with no one to explain the rules. Life is full of food-fights, sock-sliding contests, take-out, mess and unwashed laundry. 'I am making our lives a music video, a game show on Nickelodeon - lots of quick cuts, crazy camera angles, fun, fun, fun!' But behind the fun is an obsessive fear for Toph's safety, an over-compensation that becomes a running joke - this fear that if he lets Toph down in the smallest detail, the boy will grow up 'with an interest in guns and uniforms', or worse. Did the circumstances made him harder on Toph in some ways than his parents might have been? 'Well, fearing for his future, as any parent would, is not the same as being strict, which I wasn't. Much of my parents' strategy had to do with trust, and they created a situation where I wanted to reward that trust, and also a place where rebellion would not find the friction it requires. I remember once, after being ragged on for something minor, complaining that I should never be hassled at all, given that I didn't do drugs, wasn't in a gang, etc. And they said what they always said, which was: 'Go ahead, moron - do drugs, join a gang. It's your stupid life.' Which is, I feel, the perfect way to defuse any run-of-the-mill teenage rebellion. Things were similar with Toph and me, though because we're closer in age, there was - and is - even less need for rebellion or punishment.' How would his experience with Toph affect him if he had children of his own, I wondered? Eggers looks serious. He has decided there is something wrong with his bacon. 'Well,' he says, slowly. 'The most important thing I learned is that when your child is eating paint chips, it's almost never healthy. No matter how adorable they look while they're doing it.' The brothers still live together, having moved from San Francisco to New York two years ago when Eggers's idealistic magazine venture, Might, folded. Toph is at high school and Eggers now edits McSweeney's, a literary journal run on a shoestring and printed in Iceland ('we figured, why not?'), produced from a tiny room in Eggers's flat, no bigger than a cupboard and waist-deep in post. In spite - or perhaps because - of its policy of not paying contributors, McSweeney's has acquired a reputation as an important forum for new writing, including some of the most sought-after names in American fiction: Rick Moody, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem and George Saunders, among others. Eggers has been portrayed by the American press as supremely unworldly, largely because of reports that he lives in a bedsit and turned down a $2 million offer for the film rights to AHWOSG because he would find a film too upsetting. (It's not a bedsit, by the way. Under the mess, it's quite a substantial apartment in Park Slope, the nicest part of Brooklyn, a short subway ride from central Manhattan.) These reports were pure surmise, he says. If he were to sell film rights, he says, he would give the money to charity, but won't discuss it any further. I ask if he has been surprised by his book's extraordinary success. 'Yes, I was surprised. It's a weird book, right? I truly felt, and Toph felt, and most of my friends felt, that it was much too insular and specific and self-indulgent to appeal to anyone outside of our small coterie of friends and family.' So what is it about his story that has captured the imagination of America? He does that serious smile again, leaning forward over the table. 'Since it became popular, I've done a lot of thinking about it, and I'm pretty sure the success was due to one factor that no one had kept in mind, though it now seems obvious: my great clothes. I mean, I have really great clothes. And in America, thank God, that counts for something.' \u0095 A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is published by Simon &amp; Schuster, $23, and will be published in the UK by Picador on 30 June at \u00a314.99.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell was disappointed not to make the opening party of Tate Modern on Thursday. An old school friend of Nicholas Serota's and a huge fan of the new development, Sorrell was one of the few people in London who really did have something better to do. </p> <p>The chief executive of WPP was in fact putting the finishing touches to a \u00a33 billion takeover of ad group Y&amp;R, which was duly announced on Friday morning. </p> <p>The deal puts Sorrell's company at the top of the worldwide advertising league by a sizable margin, with combined annual billings of more than \u00a335 billion, and comes at the end of a month's touch-and-go negotiating. It was a far less chipper Sorrell who a fortnight ago sat in his London office sourly contemplating the fact that his approach was being fought tooth and nail, mostly by Tom Bell, head of Y&amp;R, who attempted to stitch together a white-knight deal with French-based group Publicis in order to keep his company out of Sorrell's clutches. </p> <p>Sorrell has magnanimously given Bell a chairman's role to help smooth the passage of the merger, although he admits 'it has been a pretty difficult process for both of us'. </p> <p>He is, however, used to inspiring fear and derision in his takeover targets. When he bought J Walter Thompson in an audacious hostile takeover in 1987, he was still seen as just Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's former finance director, a man of over-arching ambition who lacked the creative flair for really succeeding in the ad business. Two years later when again he won a hostile takeover battle, for Ogilvy and Mather, its illustrious founder described Sorrell as 'an odious little jerk'. </p> <p>His former colleagues, Charles and Maurice Saatchi, clashed frequently with their upstart accountant as he battled with them for supremacy in the advertising arena. </p> <p>But Sorrell's triumph against a decade of his peers secretly and publicly willing him to fail is a sign of the industry's maturity. </p> <p>The days of the start-up superstars, which Saatchi and Saatchi championed in the Eighties, are long gone. So is the mentality that a pair of pink socks and a box of pencils were the only qualifications for success. Agency groupings have become bigger and the kind of hands-on management and concentration on margins and shareholder value for which Sorrell was once lambasted have become the norm. </p> <p>'I suspect that we will see another round of consolidation in the industry triggered by our deal,' says Sorrell, adding that the move towards larger groupings was not at all out of kilter with the world of the advertising client. </p> <p>'We are not a conglomerate; we are very focused in what we do. And the world is changing. I would never be relaxed about saying that client conflict is less of an issue - it's still a very sensitive area - but you see alliances in areas of business where previously it would have been unthinkable.' </p> <p>Sorrell points to the automotive industry, where alliances between manufacturers have taken over from obsessive competition and secrecy. He says that today the idea of owning three different communications networks (he doesn't like the term 'ad agency') is perfectly sensible. </p> <p>'We can add value and we can improve margins. Y&amp;R's margins are roughly in line with our own and our target to go from 14 per cent margins to 14.5 per cent to 15 per cent by 2002 is entirely achievable. In fact we may accelerate that target. And then the question is, is there life after 15 per cent? I think there is.' Sorrell cites as examples agencies where margins run at 20 per cent. </p> <p>Although about as unsexy as an Oxo ad, Sorrell's insistence that advertising businesses could produce margins of more than 10 per cent used to send a mass attack of the vapours around the wine bars of Soho, where account directors saw their on-expenses lunches and company 4x4s under direct threat. </p> <p>'There is an inevitable logic about what we are doing with this deal,' says Sorrell. 'We already have clients shared with Y&amp;R in Ford, Sears, Mattel and Kraft. Y&amp;R has similar strengths to ours in planning and research and the work it does on assessing brand values.' </p> <p>The sceptics looking at the deal wonder, first, whether the extra size it gives WPP is just being big for the sake of being biggest and, second, whether, given the financial crisis the O&amp;M purchase pushed WPP into, whether it is wise to be once again plunging into acquisitions. </p> <p>On the first count, Sorrell's argument for the deal is that it moves with industrial logic and globalisation of business. On the second, the deal looks much more comfortable - it is based on paper, not debt, and the industry shows no sign, as it did in 1990, of toppling into recession. </p> <p>'The outlook is very good indeed,' says Sorrell. 'We have Olympic year and the US presidential election, which boost advertising growth and forecasts and see the overall market growing steadily at between 5 and 7 per cent. So we are confident that, with the savings we have to deliver, the deal will be earnings-enhancing in the first year.' </p> <p>One wonders, with Sorrell bestriding the planet, what Charles and Maurice Saatchi are up to. 'I don't know. You had better ring them up and ask them,' says Sorrell wryly. At least they would have had time to go to the Tate opening.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell was disappointed not to make the opening party of Tate Modern on Thursday. An old school friend of Nicholas Serota's and a huge fan of the new development, Sorrell was one of the few people in London who really did have something better to do. The chief executive of WPP was in fact putting the finishing touches to a \u00a33 billion takeover of ad group Y&amp;R, which was duly announced on Friday morning. The deal puts Sorrell's company at the top of the worldwide advertising league by a sizable margin, with combined annual billings of more than \u00a335 billion, and comes at the end of a month's touch-and-go negotiating. It was a far less chipper Sorrell who a fortnight ago sat in his London office sourly contemplating the fact that his approach was being fought tooth and nail, mostly by Tom Bell, head of Y&amp;R, who attempted to stitch together a white-knight deal with French-based group Publicis in order to keep his company out of Sorrell's clutches. Sorrell has magnanimously given Bell a chairman's role to help smooth the passage of the merger, although he admits 'it has been a pretty difficult process for both of us'. He is, however, used to inspiring fear and derision in his takeover targets. When he bought J Walter Thompson in an audacious hostile takeover in 1987, he was still seen as just Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's former finance director, a man of over-arching ambition who lacked the creative flair for really succeeding in the ad business. Two years later when again he won a hostile takeover battle, for Ogilvy and Mather, its illustrious founder described Sorrell as 'an odious little jerk'. His former colleagues, Charles and Maurice Saatchi, clashed frequently with their upstart accountant as he battled with them for supremacy in the advertising arena. But Sorrell's triumph against a decade of his peers secretly and publicly willing him to fail is a sign of the industry's maturity. The days of the start-up superstars, which Saatchi and Saatchi championed in the Eighties, are long gone. So is the mentality that a pair of pink socks and a box of pencils were the only qualifications for success. Agency groupings have become bigger and the kind of hands-on management and concentration on margins and shareholder value for which Sorrell was once lambasted have become the norm. 'I suspect that we will see another round of consolidation in the industry triggered by our deal,' says Sorrell, adding that the move towards larger groupings was not at all out of kilter with the world of the advertising client. 'We are not a conglomerate; we are very focused in what we do. And the world is changing. I would never be relaxed about saying that client conflict is less of an issue - it's still a very sensitive area - but you see alliances in areas of business where previously it would have been unthinkable.' Sorrell points to the automotive industry, where alliances between manufacturers have taken over from obsessive competition and secrecy. He says that today the idea of owning three different communications networks (he doesn't like the term 'ad agency') is perfectly sensible. 'We can add value and we can improve margins. Y&amp;R's margins are roughly in line with our own and our target to go from 14 per cent margins to 14.5 per cent to 15 per cent by 2002 is entirely achievable. In fact we may accelerate that target. And then the question is, is there life after 15 per cent? I think there is.' Sorrell cites as examples agencies where margins run at 20 per cent. Although about as unsexy as an Oxo ad, Sorrell's insistence that advertising businesses could produce margins of more than 10 per cent used to send a mass attack of the vapours around the wine bars of Soho, where account directors saw their on-expenses lunches and company 4x4s under direct threat. 'There is an inevitable logic about what we are doing with this deal,' says Sorrell. 'We already have clients shared with Y&amp;R in Ford, Sears, Mattel and Kraft. Y&amp;R has similar strengths to ours in planning and research and the work it does on assessing brand values.' The sceptics looking at the deal wonder, first, whether the extra size it gives WPP is just being big for the sake of being biggest and, second, whether, given the financial crisis the O&amp;M purchase pushed WPP into, whether it is wise to be once again plunging into acquisitions. On the first count, Sorrell's argument for the deal is that it moves with industrial logic and globalisation of business. On the second, the deal looks much more comfortable - it is based on paper, not debt, and the industry shows no sign, as it did in 1990, of toppling into recession. 'The outlook is very good indeed,' says Sorrell. 'We have Olympic year and the US presidential election, which boost advertising growth and forecasts and see the overall market growing steadily at between 5 and 7 per cent. So we are confident that, with the savings we have to deliver, the deal will be earnings-enhancing in the first year.' One wonders, with Sorrell bestriding the planet, what Charles and Maurice Saatchi are up to. 'I don't know. You had better ring them up and ask them,' says Sorrell wryly. At least they would have had time to go to the Tate opening.",

The general effect, as in the British Leyland rescue of 1975, was to postpone necessary changes and pile up problems which then had to be tackled, under much more difficult circumstances, a few years later. </p> <p>Some people argue that what was wrong was not the principle of intervention, but the way it was carried out: British politicians and civil servants, unlike their French counterparts, were simply bad at intervening. </p> <p>But the effectiveness of French industrial policy has been vastly exaggerated. It had a few successes in sectors such as telecommunications, where the government was able to provide its national champion - in this case Alcatel - with a guaranteed market.

Support for national champions has been largely abandoned. The main objective is to create an environment in which companies of all sorts - British-owned and foreign, small, medium-sized and large - can flourish. This has involved, among other things, seeking to remove obstacles which inhibit entrepreneurial effort (for example, by the provision of venture capital), and increasing public expenditure on basic science. </p> <p>An interesting example of these policies at work is biotechnology. This is still an emerging industry, and the share prices of the few quoted British biotechnology firms have been extremely volatile. But there is now a cluster of well capitalised companies, led by Celltech, and a host of smaller followers, many of them funded by British or foreign venture capitalists. </p> <p>This broad spread of activity is a far more promising way forward than the creation, through government-induced mergers, of a national biotechnology champion. The same applies to information technology, where the success of firms such as ARM, Autonomy and Psion suggests at least a partial renaissance in an industry where British companies have done poorly in the past. </p> <p>The one area where industrial policy in the old sense is still alive is aerospace.

You have risked your life to capture a film which shows the world how dire the situation in the African state has become. It is award-winning stuff. </p> <p>The chances are you will send the footage to one of the big agencies, who'll then sell it on to other interested newsgathering organisations. But imagine what would happen if there were a dedicated Internet site allowing news editors around the world to view your work. It would create a transparent and instantly accessible market place. Editors hunting for pictures would be able to see immediately where they could pick the best material; freelances could expect to increase their earnings as their pictures were bought by more agencies; and viewers would benefit from the explosion of choice. </p> <p>Tomorrow the idea of a global news portal for the broadcasting industry becomes a reality. <a href=\"http://www.TVnewsweb\" target=\"_new\">TVnewsweb</a>, a one-year-old company based in Hammersmith, London, launches a service which will allow editors to view footage over the Internet and download it to their bureau at the click of a mouse. The company, which is majority- owned by <a href=\"http://www.Tvbus.com\" target=\"_new\">Tvbus.com</a>, a private incubator fund, predicts that the move will revolutionise a broadcasting market estimated to be worth around \u00a34.6 billion a year. </p> <p>Not surprisingly the new company, which makes its money from commission, is spearheaded by a former cameraman, Pete Henderson, who worked with Michael Buerk in South Africa before setting up his own business providing news crews and equipment. </p> <p>'Every time I was in Beirut or some lousy place I was thinking \"God, I could be killed for this - just for a day's salary\",' he says. 'But TVnewsweb has empowered the freelancer.' </p> <p>Henderson, who is chairman of TVnewsweb, adds: 'A cameraman just back from Chechnya will go around the BBC, ITV and Sky and try to flog his material. He now has the opportunity to give us the video and we distribute it on a global basis to clients he would previously never have been able to reach.' </p> <p>He invokes a comparison between TVnewsweb and International Management Group. 'Mark McCormack [IMG's founder] turned sportsmen into the stars that they are because they deserved it as a result of their talents and skills. It's always been a belief of mine that freelancers should enjoy the same opportunities, because they're the chaps who risked their lives, had the skill and intellectual ability to cover the stories and were never paid their due. This gives them an outlet to market their material on a global basis and earn a lot more money from it.' </p> <p>But the company claims its portal will do more than earn fat fees for freelances. William Hood, the company's managing director, says: 'Currently if you're a small broadcaster, you can't afford to subscribe to Reuters or AP. And if you're a big broadcaster, you've got the logistical nightmare of trawling through 30 minutes of feeds several times a day trying to pluck out what you want. </p> <p>'With this, you've got an interactive service where you go on to the site and view all the different products, rather than having to trawl through huge amounts of video.' </p> <p>Such ambitious claims from a little-known company may sound suspect, but TVnewsweb has already signed up the BBC. In an exclusive two-year deal, TVnewsweb will distribute via its web-site all the BBC's news packages . </p> <p>Henderson says: 'It's a magnificent coup. We have access to the entire BBC news-gathering system from 54 bureaux. </p> <p>'The Beeb has a sales team and it constantly has people phoning it up saying, \"We saw this on News 24. How do we get it?\". And they've got no delivery mechanism. Now they've got a way to get it out to a potential client base who they previously couldn't get it out to,' Hood says. </p> <p>In practice, a news editor will enter the site, look at the different categories (they include everything from sports to entertainment news), click into them and, having been given a password and user name, view the footage. </p> <p>Special compression techniques mean the user can watch video at a healthy 64 kbits a second - fast enough to give a relatively good quality picture. </p> <p>Each news agency is equipped with a decoder which receives broadcast- quality pictures via a satellite link. An option to buy a piece of footage triggers an email which TVnewsweb's system receives and then 'reads' to ensure the client is who they say they are. </p> <p>The system will prevent specific agencies from buying footage if they have been 'banned' by other agencies. The system also understands the concept of the embargo. </p> <p>Once the purchase is complete, the decoder is instructed to decode the footage ordered so that news agencies can use it instantly. Each video comes with a complete shot-list as well as a script - useful for radio stations looking for copy. </p> <p>Although distribution will initially be via satellite, the company will switch to the Internet as broadband services are rolled out across the UK. </p> <p>Other big name broadcasters are likely to sign up for TVnewsweb's service in the near future, Henderson says. CNN has expressed an interest, and more than 30 broadcasters in Asia are in the process of signing up to offer their content. </p> <p>But why couldn't the big broadcasting names establish their own site and sell their footage direct? </p> <p>The answer is that they could, but TVnewsweb argues that a site which attempts to bring all the buyers and sellers together is much more attractive to news editors. </p> <p>Henderson says: 'The more content you have, and the more clients you have, the more viable the service is. This is not the core business of the broadcasters. They're tremendously excited because it gives them a reach and an opportunity that they previously wouldn't have considered.' </p> <p>If news editors are able to view and order footage online, the entire newsgathering process becomes simplified or, as Henderson puts it, 'democratised'. </p> <p>'If you are a news editor and somebody says \"There's been a flood in Mozambique,\" you think: how am I going to get these pictures out? Your closest office is in Johannesburg, but they can't get in because they can't land their planes. You go into TVnewsweb and and see that another company has hired a boat, so you opt to take their footage. It's taken the mystery out of newsgathering.' </p> <p>The site also has the potential for several lucrative spin- offs, providing it can start to attract sufficient numbers of users. Equipment and crew hire, and recruitment advertising, are two revenue sources which will grow with the site's popularity. </p> <p>Sponsorship offers another income stream.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>He presses a button and, like the entrance to Blofeld's HQ in a James Bond movie, a pale wooden panel slides open, revealing a spacious, sunny, well-furnished office. </p> <p>Sir John Browne, dapper in crisp white shirt and black trousers, militarily polished toe caps on his brogues, walks in and elects to take an armchair by the window. If there are sunlit uplands in British business, these are they. </p> <p>Last Tuesday Browne announced a record first-quarter profits surge of 256 per cent, from \u00a3677 million to \u00a32.7 billion. Last month he finalised one of the hardest-fought regulatory battles of recent memory, when the US Federal Trade Commission passed BP Amoco's takeover of US oil company Arco (Atlantic Richfield). This, combined with the Amoco deal the year before - then the biggest merger ever - has brought him the reputation of one of the world's best deal makers. </p> <p>Browne is something of an enigma. He has an old-fashioned air of discretion. He collects pre-Columbian art, is a trustee of the British Museum, enjoys reading and theatre, and swims. Apart from that, his life appears to be BP. </p> <p>Big deals are what this man has built his reputation on, and clearly they are what he likes talking about. </p> <p>Five years ago he launched a strategy to change BP from a 'two-pipeline company', based in Alaska and the North Sea, with little presence in growth areas and few gas assets, into a world giant. The huge merger with US major Amoco was chapter one. </p> <p>This deal, says Browne, came from an exhaustive courtship of global oil giants by BP. Last year's takeover of Atlantic Richfield was different. 'It was highly unusual,' he says. 'The CEO rang me and said we have concluded that we want to merge with BP Amoco.' </p> <p>Arco was driven to BP Amoco because world oil prices had slumped to as low as $10 a barrel last year and, given that its assets were mainly in Alaska, its production costs were high. Its margins were being squeezed so hard it needed a partner to survive. </p> <p>Timing for that deal was everything, says Browne. </p> <p>'Shortly afterwards, the price of oil started going up. My conclusion is that had we not done the deal at that time we could not have done it.' </p> <p>But the Arco deal landed Browne in a year's worth of wrangling with US competition authority the Federal Trade Commission. It was concerned about BP's dominance in Alaska - where it would add Arco assets to its own - and about its position in Californian petrol stations. </p> <p>Eventually the FTC forced BP Amoco to sell oil and gas assets in the massive Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska to US companies Exxon and Phillips Petroleum. But BP remains an operator in that field. </p> <p>Browne believes the regulatory environment in the US has changed dramatically recently, and that the situation could not have been resolved outside the US courts. </p> <p>'The background when we were going through merger approval was changing. We were in an election year; the price of gasoline was very high; and the standing of oil companies generally was probably going down. We then had to spend a lot of time discussing with the FTC what to do, and really we could not have a discussion with them,. So we said go to court, and we could then begin a discussion after that.' </p> <p>Browne adds that the Arco deal may have been the last of its kind. 'For mergers of scale in the oil industry in the US, the door looks shut.' </p> <p>Many city analysts were sceptical about the deal Browne emerged with. Combining BP and Arco's Alaskan assets delivered the economies of scale which was the logic of the deal. When he was forced to sell, that logic changed. </p> <p>Browne points out that a second deal allowed BP Amoco to become the sole operator of Prudhoe Bay, so increasing efficiencies - and that it received a lot for the Arco assets because the oil price was three times higher by that stage than at the beginning of the deal talks. </p> <p>He says that, strategically, it has delivered what he wanted: more gas and downstream assets in the South-West US sunbelt. </p> <p>Last week Browne said that now was to be a period of consolidation: no deals were likely in the immediate future. So how does he see the business evolving? </p> <p>'One key thing is that the rebalancing of assets towards gas, where demand is growing, and away from oil, where it is falling, will continue.'

      "bodyText": "He presses a button and, like the entrance to Blofeld's HQ in a James Bond movie, a pale wooden panel slides open, revealing a spacious, sunny, well-furnished office. Sir John Browne, dapper in crisp white shirt and black trousers, militarily polished toe caps on his brogues, walks in and elects to take an armchair by the window. If there are sunlit uplands in British business, these are they. Last Tuesday Browne announced a record first-quarter profits surge of 256 per cent, from \u00a3677 million to \u00a32.7 billion. Last month he finalised one of the hardest-fought regulatory battles of recent memory, when the US Federal Trade Commission passed BP Amoco's takeover of US oil company Arco (Atlantic Richfield). This, combined with the Amoco deal the year before - then the biggest merger ever - has brought him the reputation of one of the world's best deal makers. Browne is something of an enigma. He has an old-fashioned air of discretion. He collects pre-Columbian art, is a trustee of the British Museum, enjoys reading and theatre, and swims. Apart from that, his life appears to be BP. Big deals are what this man has built his reputation on, and clearly they are what he likes talking about. Five years ago he launched a strategy to change BP from a 'two-pipeline company', based in Alaska and the North Sea, with little presence in growth areas and few gas assets, into a world giant. The huge merger with US major Amoco was chapter one. This deal, says Browne, came from an exhaustive courtship of global oil giants by BP. Last year's takeover of Atlantic Richfield was different. 'It was highly unusual,' he says. 'The CEO rang me and said we have concluded that we want to merge with BP Amoco.' Arco was driven to BP Amoco because world oil prices had slumped to as low as $10 a barrel last year and, given that its assets were mainly in Alaska, its production costs were high. Its margins were being squeezed so hard it needed a partner to survive. Timing for that deal was everything, says Browne. 'Shortly afterwards, the price of oil started going up. My conclusion is that had we not done the deal at that time we could not have done it.' But the Arco deal landed Browne in a year's worth of wrangling with US competition authority the Federal Trade Commission. It was concerned about BP's dominance in Alaska - where it would add Arco assets to its own - and about its position in Californian petrol stations. Eventually the FTC forced BP Amoco to sell oil and gas assets in the massive Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska to US companies Exxon and Phillips Petroleum. But BP remains an operator in that field. Browne believes the regulatory environment in the US has changed dramatically recently, and that the situation could not have been resolved outside the US courts. 'The background when we were going through merger approval was changing. We were in an election year; the price of gasoline was very high; and the standing of oil companies generally was probably going down.

      "trailText": "<p>British Midland boss hopes finally to fly the Atlantic  from Fortress Heathrow.   Joanna Walters  reports</p>",
      "byline": "Joanna Walters",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sir Michael Bishop is not a Branson or a Laker. When, as he hopes, his airline British Midland launches transatlantic flights from Heathrow you will not find him throwing Ivana Trump over his shoulder or hurling himself into swimming pools \u00e0 la Branson. Nor will he be caught with arms outstretched, asking 'are you ready for Freddie?' \u00e0 la Freddie Laker, the first US fares-buster with his Seventies Skytrain. </p> <p>Bishop's will be a quiet revolution, but a revolution nonetheless, as the most genteel of Britain's airline entrepreneurs prepares to break new ground. After almost 10 years of deadlock, all the signs are that the UK and US will sign a historic deal in July to lower the drawbridge at Fortress Heathrow and let new airlines ply the Atlantic. </p> <p>It could be a big-bang, open skies agreement allowing any carrier the right to fly any combination of cities between the UK and US. What is more probable is that it will be a more modest 'mini-deal' that will committed to total open skies in the future but for the time being, allowing limited extra competition into the market. </p> <p>The two countries were on the brink of signing a deal just after Christmas, but BA lobbied Tony Blair to block it. This incensed the Americans. They threatened to ban Concorde and spark a trade war. </p> <p>Bishop told The Observer last week: 'The UK and US are just as close as you can be as trading partners. A dispute like this causes a disproportionate amount of acrimony and it is inconsistent. Each has open skies in their own country and with other trading partners but they cannot do a deal with each other. That holds back the market for everyone.' </p> <p>If a mini-deal is struck this summer after years of fruitless talks, a handful of airlines will be nominated to launch new routes between specified US cities and Heathrow. In such a case, British Midland would be the new UK player, choosing to fly initially to New York, Washington DC, Boston and Miami. As Britain's second largest scheduled airline it has a growing domestic and European network but has never flown long-haul. </p> <p>Continental Airlines and Delta are considered the most likely of the US carriers currently confined to Gatwick, to be allowed to move their London flights to Heathrow, serving Houston, Newark and Atlanta. </p> <p>Both business and tourist passengers will be in the money as a result. At present it costs at least \u00a33,000 return to fly business class from Heathrow to New York and the East coast of the US and upwards of \u00a35,000 to go west to the likes of Los Angeles. But business flights to New York from Frankfurt, Brus sels, Paris, Zurich, Milan, Madrid or Amsterdam range from \u00a31,288 to \u00a32,418 return. There are similar disparities for other major US cities. </p> <p>Off-season leisure fare giveaways have always produced the winter bargains of \u00a3199 and less. But they are always limited in number and dry up when the sun comes out. </p> <p>Branson's Virgin Atlantic has had a huge impact since it launched from Gatwick in 1984 and battled its way into Heathrow in 1991, especially on the UK-US market, which the Official Airline Guide estimates is the largest in the world at 10.5 million passengers a year. But with only BA and Virgin, and two US airlines, American and United, allowed substantial transatlantic operations from Heathrow, new rivals are desperate to get in. </p> <p>Bishop is coy about the business and leisure fares he will charge when he actually begins flights next summer but he is bound to cause a stir. 'I think people have been surprised to realise how much extra they are paying to fly from Heathrow,' he said. </p> <p>But will this be good news for the nation if opening up Heathrow damages flag-carrier BA and Branson's Virgin, which has worked so hard for its slice of the cake? </p> <p>The UK Government has always protected BA's inherited dominance at Heathrow. Its transatlantic profits prop up the rest of the company. But the airline is about to announce the first annual loss since privatisation, and it could be upwards of a whopping \u00a3250m. Surely the Government will not abandon its favourite in its darkest hour, with barbarians at the gate? </p> <p>Margaret Thatcher let Virgin, American and United into Heathrow in 1991. The then BA chairman Lord King angrily accused the Government of giving away the airline's 'crown jewels', and cut his company's donations to the Conservative Party. BA is a formidable company, however, and learnt to live with the extra competition. </p> <p>The signs are that Labour will now expect it to do the same again. One industry observer said: 'BA is no longer the only national champion and cannot expect all the attention. Virgin, Midland and the low-cost airlines are growing like mad.' </p> <p>These aggressive, innovative rivals have contributed to BA's financial travails, exacerbating its problems with high costs, overcapacity and the Asian crisis. Tim Jeans, sales and marketing director of top low-cost airline Ryanair, said: 'No other major carrier in Europe faces the degree of competition in its home market that BA does. </p> <p>'I think the UK Government no longer sees BA as the only national interest, sending armies of civil servants rushing around the world negotiating on its behalf. These days if BA does not fly on a particular route someone else will.' </p> <p>BA's new chief executive Rod Eddington does not have a hotline to Tony Blair as did his predecessor, Bob Ayling, a close associate of the Prime Minister. Eddington knows the chill wind of commercial reality is going to whip through more and more of BA's cosy corners over the next few years. He could even use the terrifying prospect of unbridled competition at Heathrow to help force restructuring at the airline, the way George Simpson did at Rover when the Japanese carmakers began manufacturing in the UK more than 10 years ago. </p> <p>But how will an airline such as British Midland, which has 6,000 staff compared with BA's 60,000, prosper on the cut-throat Atlantic? It will trade on its own strong reputation in Europe and its membership of the Star Alliance. Star is the most effective global airline group so far, led by Midland stake-holders Lufthansa and SAS, United of the US, Singapore Airlines and Air Canada. </p> <p>Midland will fly the Atlantic with its own aircraft, crew and brand, although it will rename itself once it gets its Atlantic rights, in order to drop the provincial connotations of its identity.

      "bodyText": "Sir Michael Bishop is not a Branson or a Laker. When, as he hopes, his airline British Midland launches transatlantic flights from Heathrow you will not find him throwing Ivana Trump over his shoulder or hurling himself into swimming pools \u00e0 la Branson. Nor will he be caught with arms outstretched, asking 'are you ready for Freddie?' \u00e0 la Freddie Laker, the first US fares-buster with his Seventies Skytrain. Bishop's will be a quiet revolution, but a revolution nonetheless, as the most genteel of Britain's airline entrepreneurs prepares to break new ground. After almost 10 years of deadlock, all the signs are that the UK and US will sign a historic deal in July to lower the drawbridge at Fortress Heathrow and let new airlines ply the Atlantic. It could be a big-bang, open skies agreement allowing any carrier the right to fly any combination of cities between the UK and US. What is more probable is that it will be a more modest 'mini-deal' that will committed to total open skies in the future but for the time being, allowing limited extra competition into the market. The two countries were on the brink of signing a deal just after Christmas, but BA lobbied Tony Blair to block it. This incensed the Americans. They threatened to ban Concorde and spark a trade war. Bishop told The Observer last week: 'The UK and US are just as close as you can be as trading partners. A dispute like this causes a disproportionate amount of acrimony and it is inconsistent. Each has open skies in their own country and with other trading partners but they cannot do a deal with each other. That holds back the market for everyone.' If a mini-deal is struck this summer after years of fruitless talks, a handful of airlines will be nominated to launch new routes between specified US cities and Heathrow. In such a case, British Midland would be the new UK player, choosing to fly initially to New York, Washington DC, Boston and Miami. As Britain's second largest scheduled airline it has a growing domestic and European network but has never flown long-haul. Continental Airlines and Delta are considered the most likely of the US carriers currently confined to Gatwick, to be allowed to move their London flights to Heathrow, serving Houston, Newark and Atlanta. Both business and tourist passengers will be in the money as a result. At present it costs at least \u00a33,000 return to fly business class from Heathrow to New York and the East coast of the US and upwards of \u00a35,000 to go west to the likes of Los Angeles. But business flights to New York from Frankfurt, Brus sels, Paris, Zurich, Milan, Madrid or Amsterdam range from \u00a31,288 to \u00a32,418 return. There are similar disparities for other major US cities. Off-season leisure fare giveaways have always produced the winter bargains of \u00a3199 and less. But they are always limited in number and dry up when the sun comes out. Branson's Virgin Atlantic has had a huge impact since it launched from Gatwick in 1984 and battled its way into Heathrow in 1991, especially on the UK-US market, which the Official Airline Guide estimates is the largest in the world at 10.5 million passengers a year. But with only BA and Virgin, and two US airlines, American and United, allowed substantial transatlantic operations from Heathrow, new rivals are desperate to get in. Bishop is coy about the business and leisure fares he will charge when he actually begins flights next summer but he is bound to cause a stir. 'I think people have been surprised to realise how much extra they are paying to fly from Heathrow,' he said. But will this be good news for the nation if opening up Heathrow damages flag-carrier BA and Branson's Virgin, which has worked so hard for its slice of the cake? The UK Government has always protected BA's inherited dominance at Heathrow. Its transatlantic profits prop up the rest of the company. But the airline is about to announce the first annual loss since privatisation, and it could be upwards of a whopping \u00a3250m. Surely the Government will not abandon its favourite in its darkest hour, with barbarians at the gate? Margaret Thatcher let Virgin, American and United into Heathrow in 1991. The then BA chairman Lord King angrily accused the Government of giving away the airline's 'crown jewels', and cut his company's donations to the Conservative Party. BA is a formidable company, however, and learnt to live with the extra competition. The signs are that Labour will now expect it to do the same again. One industry observer said: 'BA is no longer the only national champion and cannot expect all the attention. Virgin, Midland and the low-cost airlines are growing like mad.' These aggressive, innovative rivals have contributed to BA's financial travails, exacerbating its problems with high costs, overcapacity and the Asian crisis. Tim Jeans, sales and marketing director of top low-cost airline Ryanair, said: 'No other major carrier in Europe faces the degree of competition in its home market that BA does. 'I think the UK Government no longer sees BA as the only national interest, sending armies of civil servants rushing around the world negotiating on its behalf. These days if BA does not fly on a particular route someone else will.' BA's new chief executive Rod Eddington does not have a hotline to Tony Blair as did his predecessor, Bob Ayling, a close associate of the Prime Minister. Eddington knows the chill wind of commercial reality is going to whip through more and more of BA's cosy corners over the next few years. He could even use the terrifying prospect of unbridled competition at Heathrow to help force restructuring at the airline, the way George Simpson did at Rover when the Japanese carmakers began manufacturing in the UK more than 10 years ago. But how will an airline such as British Midland, which has 6,000 staff compared with BA's 60,000, prosper on the cut-throat Atlantic? It will trade on its own strong reputation in Europe and its membership of the Star Alliance. Star is the most effective global airline group so far, led by Midland stake-holders Lufthansa and SAS, United of the US, Singapore Airlines and Air Canada. Midland will fly the Atlantic with its own aircraft, crew and brand, although it will rename itself once it gets its Atlantic rights, in order to drop the provincial connotations of its identity. But it will rely on United's ubiquitous presence in the US to promote and sell its services as part of a network operation. Lufthansa, SAS and Midland increasingly think together when planning strategy in Europe. Midland launched flights to Madrid, Rome and Milan earlier this month and is planning other new European services aimed jointly at making money and plugging gaps where the Star network is weak, particularly in southern Europe. Bishop and senior executives from SAS and Lufthansa shared a platform at a British ambassadorial reception in Madrid last week to celebrate the new flights and their growing partnership. Midland is already the largest Star player at Heathrow. Transatlantic flights will give it extra clout itself but also help Star mount a formidable challenge in the business travel market to BA and its less-organised Oneworld alliance with American Airlines, Cathay Pacific and others. Bishop said: 'Two years ago we had to make a very big decision - should we throw all the service off the aircraft and become a low-cost, budget airline at Heathrow?

'Authors do not necessarily feel bound to their first publisher,' points out Janson-Smith. 'In fact they are likely to want just as much if not more for their next book or they will go elsewhere.' Salvation may lie in the cheaper mass-market editions. These need to be taken into account and are making money for books which had a lukewarm impact at launch. The Drowning People has, for example, sold a more impressive 27,277 copies at \u00a35.99 in paperback,while Ramster's Ladies Man has quickly sold 5,261 copies at the same reduced price. vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>It's not funny, or clever, or kind. But just when it's most unfashionable, I have to confess, I love my BMW. I try not to park near anything bearing a Rover badge, and am happy to let Rovers of all shapes and sizes overtake me. I don't want to get into any trouble. But you see, my BMW is from another era, when the automotive industry was altogether more civilised and friendly - a time when it was not referred to as a 'beamer' but simply by its number, 02 (short for 2002). It is an L-reg from last time around and is three years older than I am, giving it the status of a vintage car - although, typically, it misses tax exemption by one measly year. </p> <p>I had seen these funny little cars occasionally parked on a street in Soho, or passing on a dual carriageway. They were quite dinky in size, with the sort of headlights and round, rear brake lights you might imagine Noddy's car to have. And they were always in the most off-beat of 70s colours - yellowy orange, leafy green or, sometimes, metallic blue. And every time I saw one, I knew I had to have one. So when an acquaintance announced she was selling hers, I put the battered, reliable old Citro\u00ebn AX up for sale in the pages of Loot, and before I had even checked to see if it had an engine, agreed to part with \u00a32,000 for a shiny, cream-coloured 2002. </p> <p>We went on a test drive, and despite the fact the car stalled at every set of traffic lights and consumed \u00a320 of 4-star at the petrol station (just a top up), I was dazzled. The car was in great condition, just 58,000 miles on the clock. It's an automatic, which means that it's great fun, and feels a bit like you're driving a New York cab. Despite its appearance, it has a 2-litre engine which has a really lovely hum to it, and is 'well-pokey'. The car was all original inside, complete with the basic radio which has the advantage that no one will ever want to nick it. It only picks up medium wave and long wave, narrowing the choice of stations to Sunrise for a bit of Bollywood musical, and the ones that only play the sounds of the 70s, which, of course, suits the car perfectly. It even had its original tax disc in the glove compartment, and just needed some work on the carburettor - a bit of tweaking and tuning. The agreement was that I would pick it up from the garage. The bill came to close on \u00a3500 for the reconditioned carb; I began to realise why the car was for sale. </p> <p>When you fall in love with a car, all rational thought goes out through the quarterlight window. Forty pounds for a full tank of petrol was a small price to pay - even if the car could barely make it from one service station to the next on a trip up the motorway. On our first run from London to Liverpool, we refuelled three times, partly because the fuel gauge doesn't work. That was around \u00a3100 for a 200-mile journey. But what did 50p per mile matter when, on every petrol forecourt, G\u00fcnter (yes, that's his name) attracted admiring glances from the cars around him, and comments of approval from the attendants? And although it didn't quite seem to make sense taking the bottles and newspapers to the recycling plant in a car that consumed lead-heavy, polluting gas, fellow recyclers would nod with approval and stop to have a chat. 'I used to have one of those,' the man in the People Carrier would say. 'It was a great little car - it can really go. Bought it new in 1974.' </p> <p>It's a funny thing, but everyone seems to have owned an 02 at some point in their life. The owner of the garage where I originally picked G\u00fcnter up from had one. And the owner of the garage he now frequents for his services and his MOT, as well as the time he had to be towed from the Red Route in Islington before the police got there first, informs me that he had one, too. It gives you a feeling of reassurance. </p> <p>G\u00fcnter's not like a modern car, and needs a little extra care and attention. Surprisingly, he recently passed his MOT. He just needed a bit of welding and his headlamps had to be adjusted. 'They have the worst headlamps in the world,' the owner tells me, making up my bill. (Just \u00a3150 this time.) 'I remember once going to Wales in mine. Driving round those dark lanes, I'd have been better off with a torch out of the window. In the end, d'you know what I did? I got a pair of headlamps from an old Mini, which aren't much better, but they fit. I jammed and glued them in. A great improvement.' </p> <p>They might not shine too brightly, but the headlamps and the round, Sputnik-like tail lights are part of the car's charm. Some 2002s have square tail-lights. But there is something friendly and inviting about the round ones. Certainly, G\u00fcnter looked very handsome when we waxed his bonnet and buffed up his chrome to show him off at the BMW 02 register 10th anniversary at Brooklands last summer. This is part of the joy of owning a vintage car. Not only can you wave at other 02s you pass on the road, and get cheap insurance, but you also get to join a club, and your car's registration number is printed in the Welcome column of the register newsletter. I'd been to the odd car rally before, but never actually participated in one. </p> <p>Unfortunately, by the time we got to the legendary racetrack, we'd missed the chance to drive over the Test Hill. So we just drove around to the steep, curving concrete bank and parked up alongside the other 2002s. The car next to us had its bonnet open, displaying a pristine, steam-cleaned engine. We had only just managed to scrape the mush of dead leaves out from the ledge under the windscreen, and hadn't realised we were supposed to clean the engine as well. </p> <p>A lot of the cars are owned by real petrolheads. There were cars there that boasted whole rear windows filled with awards. Some were feats of restoration. Others had had their suspension jacked up and really fat wheels added, as though they were in competition to be the new Herbie. The steam-cleaned man next to us sidled over for a chat, and offered us some advice: that we should convert our automatic choke to manual. We nodded knowingly, admired his engine, and continued to unpack our picnic from the boot. (Incidentally, one of the 02's little foibles is that anything you store in the boot comes out smelling of petrol.) </p> <p>There's something very British about sitting on a stretch of historic Tarmac, eating sandwiches alongside a gathering of a hundred or so other matching cars. After we had wandered around, agreed that we definitely preferred the round rear-lights to the square ones, admired some very cool CSIs that had gathered on a different part of the track, and jumbled through a box of oily bits and pieces on sale at a stall, it was time to go home. Next time, we thought, we'll steam-clean his engine. This year's Brooklands meet is set for 6 August, but, of course, the big one will be in 2002, the year when the market price for the 02 will no doubt double. Even then, it still won't repay the amount I've spent on him. And anyway, G\u00fcnter is not for sale.</p>",

The problem is I'm feeling wintered out and depressed by weeks of rain and grey skies - I've even been comfort-eating further into April than usual. My body's in need of a spring clean. Like many people's routine, however, mine is such that I can't face undergoing a detox programme that will leave me feeling weak and wan, nor do I see the point of depriving myself. I need a pampering regime, not a bullying one. So I've decided to prioritise my body over the next week and boost its nutrient reserves, replenish its batteries and, with luck, rekindle both my outer and inner glow.</p> <p>Many of my patients find my 'boosting' programme achievable because, with a little resolve, they can eat foods that they enjoy. The resulting invigorating feelings of detoxification and lightness, as well as renewed energy and ability to concentrate, make the exercise worthwhile. I wouldn't recommend embarking on this programme if you have a heavy work schedule, however. And although 10 days is the target length for my body-cleansing programme, if you don't have the necessary window in your diary, give yourself as many days as you can. If you regularly take medication or have a health problem, consult your doctor before starting. If weight loss will cause you problems, consider restricting yourself to a weekend fruit-and-vegetable regime instead. I recommend that anyone starting the programme does so at the weekend.</p> <p>Some people often abandon a cleansing programme because they haven't prepared themselves. So make sure that you have a 10-day supply of beneficial food, otherwise your craving for munchies will get the better of you and the dial-a-pizza urge will win. Consider buying or resurrecting a blender, juicer or food processor, all of which make creating juices, soups and smoothies child's play. Make sure you have plenty of fresh herbs, lemons, limes and good-quality olive oil with which to make dressings and dishes more appetising.</p> <p>When cooking, think ahead and make extra portions to enjoy over several days. Grilled or roasted vegetables, for instance, are delicious served cold with some lean charcuterie, chicken, lentils or beans at lunchtime, or when a busy evening dictates a dish that is quick to make. Eating regularly can help you to avoid feeling dizzy and lethargic, and you can eat as many fruits and vegetables as you like.</p> <p>Over the first weekend of your detox, eat only fruit and vegetables (except potatoes, which are too starchy at this stage). Indulge your body with juices, stirfries, salads, grilled vegetables, fruit salads, poached fruits, comptes, stuffed peppers, tomatoes or saut\u00e9ed wild mushrooms. Avoiding concentrated carbohydrates (pasta, bread, rice and potatoes) and protein-rich foods (meat, fish, chicken and cheese) will really cleanse your body, as will banishing fatty and sweet foods. As well as making sure that your food is fresh and simple, keep cooking times to a minimum. Because your digestive system doesn't like excess fats (which cause bloating and indigestion) and neither does your circulatory system, use only a little olive oil to make dressings.</p> <p>Your body may feel strange at the start of the programme. This is not only due to changing your diet and routine but also because the best detox should involve weaning yourself off caffeine, alcohol and any other addictive substances. Hydrate your body with plenty of water (aim to drink at least two litres a day). Although alcohol can be perfectly healthy in moderation, you will feel a lot more energetic and more balanced after spending a week or so off the booze. The physiological benefits of abstinence include giving your liver a rest and helping you to banish baggy, sore and tired-looking eyes and skin.</p> <p>After your weekend of detoxing, it's time to move on to phase two: introducing two daily helpings of protein into your diet. Stick to sources of lean protein, such as fish, chicken, lean red meat, eggs, seafood, turkey, tofu and pulses. Vegetarians may feel better if they avoid nuts, which contain rather too much fat to cleanse the body properly. Aim to eat the equivalent of a large-sized chicken breast for lunch and supper, which equates to two to three eggs, a medium-sized fillet steak, a large cup of pulses, a dozen langoustines or half a dozen oysters. Maintaining your protein intake will not only provide your body with essential amino acids to feed your muscles, but will also keep your mood sunny, because the amino acids tryptophan and l-phenylalanine produce serotonin and noradrenaline, the endorphins known as 'happy hormones'.</p> <p>Avoid the richer dairy products, such as cream and cheese, during this week. You can, however, include yoghurt made from cow, sheep or goat's milk in your diet, and I recommend live, full-fat, calcium-rich yoghurts that contain beneficial bacteria, such as bifidus, acidophilus and lactobacillus, which can help replenish your gut flora, alleviate bloating and help build up a strong immune system.</p> <p>Maintain your energy levels by eating a little often.

      "body": "<p>The memory is shrouded in a dream-like haze, as though it were something I watched on TV. I was sitting in a GP's office and he was saying, 'Of course, we can cure your acne with a shot of oestrogen, but...' He shrugged his shoulder and chuckled at the imagined absurdity of the suggestion, but I scarcely heard him, because my mind was racing forward to images of myself with varying degrees of newly minted breast and bum - and clear skin - and I was thinking, 'Hey, that's not so bad.' It seemed to work for the ladyboys of Bangkok. And, of course, women. Unfortunately, each time I blinked, my imaginary appendages seemed to get bigger, until I was standing there in my mind's eye as Diana Dors. God, how could I wear that lipstick with that eye shadow? I'd rather have acne. But only just. It was at this point that I realised I had a problem.</p> <p>Adults tend not to take acne seriously, and it's true that the misery it produces is relative. Next to being flattened by a meteorite, or liquidised in a giant blender, or trapped in a lift with Chris Evans, acne is trivial. It goes without saying that there are many more debilitating diseases and afflictions. But it can do damage, nonetheless. In my case, it started suddenly at about the age of 14, as though a little demon came in the night and sprinkled it over my face and back. At first, the angry spots and lumps were itchy and irritating, but over the coming months, they steadily spread and got worse. The statistics say that 85 per cent of people between the ages of 12 and 25 suffer acne to some extent, but a few of us find our faces colonised with serious 'inflammatory' acne to the extent that we become almost unrecognisable. If you're enjoying a pizza lunch right now, you may prefer to return to this later, because there were times when every inch of my face and forehead was covered with glowering pustules and hideous, boil-like mounds, with blackheads and whiteheads and unspeakable growths for which names, to my knowledge, don't even exist.</p> <p>I tried all kinds of things simply to render the condition manageable. I tried a sun lamp, vitamin E on the skin, various types of wash and commercial products which didn't seem to work and may have done more harm than good. In the hope that an allergy might be involved, I cut out certain foods, drinking only goat's milk for a couple of years, but that didn't help either. The only things which did help were sun and antibiotics, which I was prescribed in increasingly strong forms and dosages, until my skin began to stabilise itself when I was about 20. The damage this did to my immune system has taken years to repair, but I still suspect that, given the same set of options, I would do the same again. David Collins, who runs a website dedicated to the subject, speaks of the 'Porsche test': ask a sufferer if they would rather have a brand-new Porsche or clear skin, he says, and you will always get the same answer. Move around the various sites devoted to the subject, and you're struck by a mood of simmering desperation, backed by a bewildering number of suggestions for remedies. Collins himself advocates (Ro)Accutane, the strong drug of last resort which has been linked to depression, suicide and birth defects. 'Forget the scare stories,' he says. 'You are trading long-term psychological pain for short-term mild discomfort.' Scary, yes, but I know where he's coming from.</p> <p>The problem is that, while some unlucky adults retain clinical acne, which is recognised as a disease, it hits most of us when we are at our most vulnerable: during adolescence. This is a time when our self-image is coalescing and we're groping, often literally, towards a sexual identity. I remember the mixed feelings I had after returning from my first year at college and hearing a succession of previously uninterested women telling me, 'Wow - you've changed.'</p> <p>I felt relief, but also a little anger. I hadn't changed. Only my skin had. This would give me pause for thought many times over the years, when I found myself choosing to go out with one person over another partly or primarily because of the way they looked. Those girls from home were being no more fickle or shallow than me - which is perhaps the most painful fact to acknowledge in this story.</p> <p>No one seems to know precisely what causes Acne vulgaris, as the affliction is undecorously known to the medical profession, but we do know that there is a strong element of heredity involved. It develops when the glands that produce an oily substance called sebum begin to work overtime, possibly due to hormone changes that occur during the teen years. One function of sebum is to carry cells shed by the glands to the surface of the skin. The trouble starts when excess sebum is blocking the gland ducts, causing both cells and sebum to accumulate, forming a plug called a comedo. If this plug stays below the surface of the skin, it becomes a whitehead. If it enlarges and pops out, the tip looks dark (due to a build-up of the pigment melanin, not grease or dirt) and you have a blackhead. If the process continues, a spot emerges. In girls, this process often starts at around the age of 11, in boys at 13. In both cases, research has suggested that a hormone called androgen plays a role, because it stimulates the sebum-producing glands. After puberty, boys produce 10 times as much androgen as girls, which is why far more boys than girls develop severe inflammatory acne. Bacterium, such as Corynebacterium acnes, may also be actively involved, causing skin fats to break down into irritating chemicals.</p> <p>Things that can make acne worse are picking at it; certain drugs, including some forms of contraceptive pill; exposure to industrial oils, grease and chemicals; some oily cosmetics and - this is a big one - stress and strong emotion, be they triggered by big dates or pressure from exams. There is no evidence that greasy food or oily skin or hair have any direct bearing on the condition - and sex and masturbation certainly don't, though they can mess up your bedroom carpet. At the same time, a healthy, balanced diet can boost the immune system and so reduce inflammation, and there is a suggestion that excess caloric intake can increase production of testosterone - a bad thing. Some people find that reducing their iodine intake (through shellfish, iodized salt and milk) is helpful.</p> <p>Antibiotics like tetracycline are still prescribed to deal with the problem, but it is now widely recognised that long-term intake of these is extremely unwise. Other drugs, such as the aforementioned Accutane, are also used, but are similarly best avoided if at all possible. These are between you and your doctor, and long before reaching them, there are many naturally based aids that are worth trying. Drinking lots of water helps the body to flush out toxins and relieves the skin from this duty, for instance. Washing should be done no more than two or three times a day, and gently: there is an unconscious tendency to want to punish the skin by scrubbing it, but drying it out, or upsetting its pH balance, will make matters worse.</p> <p>In addition, some research contends that hormone levels increase when sleep is disturbed, so sleep patterns may be worth looking at and anything which can assist relaxation - exercise, yoga, Grateful Dead albums - can do no harm. Arguably.</p> <p>Requiring more commitment are regimes of vitamin and mineral supplements. Often suggested are C, E and B complexes, and zinc, all of which must be treated with caution and used only after taking advice on the appropriate dosages. Herbal remedies I've seen recommended include saw palmetto berry extract (for boys), chaste tree berry (for girls), echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral, dandelion root, red clover, yellow dock root and green tea extract pills... so a quick trip to the herbalist is probably worthwhile.</p> <p>Exfoliating once or twice a day with distilled white vinegar (dilute until the stinging is tolerable, leave on the skin for 10 minutes, then wash off with cool water), or with lemon or tomato (same procedure), works well for some sufferers, with results taking about 14 days to show. Stranger still are the range of face masks to be found on <a href=\"http://www.absoluteacneinfo.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.absoluteacneinfo.com</a>, based on egg yolk, honey and oatmeal, milk of magnesia, even strawberries. If they don't work, at least you can eat them or use them to reduce stress through a range of popular sex games.</p> <p>Does acne come with any blessings? Yes, a few. When I look in the mirror now, I still expect to see something riven with welts and lesions and am surprised when I don't. I suppose this is to be thankful for. Then, the other week, a friend made an unkind comment about someone being overweight and later said that she'd 'watched a sort of cloud' pass over my face. At the time, she thought this was some kind of PC reflex, but it wasn't. I was remembering what it's like to be obscured by, and judged on, your appearance alone; to go through life with the feeling that your true self is unseen. If acne taught me one thing, it is how much looks count for in the world and how suspicious the wise person should be of this.</p> <p><b> The five ages of acne</b></p> <p>While acne is commonly thought of as the preserve of the teenage skin, it can hit at any age. 'The most common form of acne is caused when the body becomes hypersensitive to the male hormones we all carry,' says Dr Anne Eady from the Skin Research Centre at the University of Leeds. 'This can happen at any age - what varies is the trigger.'</p> <p><b> Neonatal acne</b> About 20 per cent of babies develop acne in the few weeks after birth. 'They develop little red spots normally confined to the face,' says Dr Eady. 'It's a reaction to residual hormones transmitted from the mother's blood in pregnancy or through breast milk - it normally clears up after six months.'</p> <p><b> Infantile acne</b> Some children develop the more traditional form of acne with blackheads and white spots at the age of one to two. Exactly why is unknown, but it can be treated.</p> <p><b> Prepubertal acne</b> Acne that develops in children aged eight to nine is very rare and is normally caused by disorders in the endocrine system.</p> <p><b> Adolescent acne</b> All teenagers get acne to some degree. 'It starts just before puberty, when the skin begins to produce sebum (or oil) and the maturation of the sex glands increases this further,' says Dr Eady. 'Cell renewal also speeds up, and this combined with the additional oil in the pores causes blockages in the skin which can get infected.'</p> <p><b> Late-onset acne</b> One in five adults develop spots in their twenties, thirties or forties. It's more common in women, as it's often linked to the development of polycystic ovary syndrome. 'Its also often blamed on increased stress aggravating hormone levels,' says Dr Eady.</p>",

If acne taught me one thing, it is how much looks count for in the world and how suspicious the wise person should be of this. The five ages of acne While acne is commonly thought of as the preserve of the teenage skin, it can hit at any age. 'The most common form of acne is caused when the body becomes hypersensitive to the male hormones we all carry,' says Dr Anne Eady from the Skin Research Centre at the University of Leeds. 'This can happen at any age - what varies is the trigger.' Neonatal acne About 20 per cent of babies develop acne in the few weeks after birth. 'They develop little red spots normally confined to the face,' says Dr Eady. 'It's a reaction to residual hormones transmitted from the mother's blood in pregnancy or through breast milk - it normally clears up after six months.' Infantile acne Some children develop the more traditional form of acne with blackheads and white spots at the age of one to two. Exactly why is unknown, but it can be treated. Prepubertal acne Acne that develops in children aged eight to nine is very rare and is normally caused by disorders in the endocrine system. Adolescent acne All teenagers get acne to some degree. 'It starts just before puberty, when the skin begins to produce sebum (or oil) and the maturation of the sex glands increases this further,' says Dr Eady. 'Cell renewal also speeds up, and this combined with the additional oil in the pores causes blockages in the skin which can get infected.' Late-onset acne One in five adults develop spots in their twenties, thirties or forties. It's more common in women, as it's often linked to the development of polycystic ovary syndrome. 'Its also often blamed on increased stress aggravating hormone levels,' says Dr Eady.",

      "byline": "Nicci Gerrard",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We are all of us dying, of course. In the middle of life, we are in death. But some of us are dying more quickly than others. John Diamond is dying more quickly. Three months, he gives himself; maybe six months; a year, perhaps, even two if he has the luck he hasn't had so far. Who knows, he says with his nice, ironic shrug, the same shrug he gives when you ask him how he is: who knows? Not him. </p> <p>His cancer was diagnosed three years ago, and since then he's been slithering down the statistical slide, from the 90-something per cent chance of surviving to the going-on 100 per cent chance of not. He's been poisoned, blasted, had bits lopped off him, been in remission, felt lumps grow again, been given shreds of hope, had hope removed. He's lost his tongue, his voice, his middle-aged paunch, his sense of an assumed future. 'I am almost certainly dying,' he says, 'but I live as if I'm not. Not because I've discovered a great truth, but because it is the only possible way to live.' He's not Dennis Potter, rhapsodising over cherry blossom and life's unbearable beauty as he swigged liquid morphine. He's more like Philip Larkin, who said if you were really conscious of your mortality, you wouldn't be able to get out of bed in the morning. Life's not like a supermarket sweep, he says, when you have to frantically throw all the things you don't usually buy into your trolley, cram as much in before that final buzzer goes. He doesn't read the great novels or listen to the great operas he has never quite got round to. He procrastinates more than ever, misses deadlines, reads the same bad detective thrillers he always has, plays poker, cracks jokes, enjoys the things he used to enjoy. For one of the things John Diamond has learned - along with the vocabulary of cancer and the architecture of fear, the way to eat a pear without a tongue - is that you are always in the middle of your own life. In the midst of death, we are in life. </p> <p>John Diamond is a journalist, a writer and a one-time broadcaster. He used to make much of his living from his voice, 'gabby' he calls the person he used to be, but now has no voice - or not the kind of voice that he can go on radio with, to be witty and opinionated. It's a sparsely consonanted heave of sound from his throat, which family and close friends can understand but others have difficulty with. He is married to the journalist and cookery writer, Nigella Lawson, whose food he can no longer eat. He is not without a sense of irony about all of this, nor about how he has always wanted to be famous and now is famous for his cancer. The painful, funny column he writes about his cancer in The Times, the unsentimental, wry, sad book he wrote about it, the TV documentary that tracked him through diagnoses and operations - all these things have made him, he says, with his sardonic grin, Mr Celebrity Cancer. He sometimes feels as if he's 'landed the cancer franchise for the chattering classes'. One of the tricky things about interviewing John Diamond is that he's already asked himself the questions, made the criticisms, attacked himself in print (a diamond to cut a diamond). He writes about having cancer; he writes about writing about having cancer In the last column I read by him, he wrote about being interviewed and photographed by a Sunday paper - getting his word in first. </p> <p>I meet him at his lovely house in West London - lovely not just because it's big and light-filled and book-crammed, with a long green garden, but also because it is brimful of life. John Diamond is downstairs in the large kitchen, hub of the house, feeding lunch to his small son, Bruno. There is a fluid crowd of other people - the nanny; Nigella (who's upstairs, filming her latest cookery programme for Channel Four, she wanders in and out); members of the TV team; friends, who enter by way of the garden. 'It's like one of those mad sitcom houses with people popping in and out all the time,' says/writes John Diamond. Most of his side of our conversation is written down, either in his neat italic handwriting, or on his computer up in the study. 'It's like watching a French film with subtitles,' he replies, when I say I'm sure I could follow his speech. 'You're convinced that if there were no subtitles you could still understand it - but you (I) couldn't.' </p> <p>He is looking pretty good: thinnish in his jeans and silk shirt, pale, hair bleached off-white ('It's my perhaps-David-Irving-had-a-point look'). He keeps his mouth closed much of the time, even when he smiles, and this gives him a kind and secret air. His throat is circled with livid scars - he says that if he'd had all his operations at once, his head would have fallen off - and he lifts his shirt up to show me the puckered ridge running up his back, where he had muscle removed to replace the lower portion of tongue in his jaw. His body is like a battlefield. The Times used to call his diary the 'Diary of Courage', until he asked them to change it. People write to tell him how brave he is. He doesn't think he is brave - his book is titled C: Because Cowards Can Get Cancer Too . 'Courage implies some kind of choice in the way one behaves, and I am behaving the way I behave because that seems to be the way I behave. In any case, when people ask you what you do, you can't say: \"Oh, I write the Diary of Courage.\"' </p> <p>When you picture a man in his mid-forties, with two small children, who will probably die soon, who's been in and out of hospital under the knife, who has no tongue, can't eat, can't properly talk - well, that sounds pretty grim and scary. But John Diamond isn't grim. There is a feeling of lightness about him, and of zest. His days are spent writing his columns, or his play, or (more rarely) the novel he is working on, tossing coffee or his liquid gloop down his opened throat ('I have to throw it down in one go because without a tongue I can't move food from the front of my mouth to the back and thus down my gullet. I have learned to open my throat - I have no epiglottis to shield my windpipe - and pour it down rather as one might pour it into a bath'), smoking (the doctors agree the reasons for not smoking are irrelevant now, and smoking is the nearest he gets to eating - he tastes the cigarette; he savours it), seeing friends, getting stoned or drunk, not being scared. </p> <p>'Because most of the time I'm not scared. I get on with life, not because I'm a fatalist, but because that's the most congenial way of dealing with things. Indeed, most of the time, I'm not conscious of dealing with anything. I think of myself as being in remission, and, therefore, as someone with cancer. But whenever I talk about still being cancerous, the doctors affect mock anger and tell me that I don't have it. What they mean is that I have it in such small quantities that it doesn't show up on the scanner, or didn't the last time they looked, at least. But it is remission. The six months' worth of chemo finished about nine months ago, and the average remission in the 25 per cent of people in my condition for whom chemo is useful stay clear for, on average, between three and six months, so to that extent I suppose I am bucking the trend.' </p> <p>In spite of his clear-eyed sense that his horizons have diminished to the rim of days around him, he has just bought himself a Palm Pilot and has entered dates up to August - when he is going to Edinburgh to direct the one-woman play he is writing for and with Maria McErlane, and to keep in touch with Victoria Coren's one-man play based on his columns. 'The thing is,' he says, 'most of the time I feel just like I ever did, except for the voice and the food. Every so often, though, I do get scared - mainly by the realisation that although I work on the hypothesis that because I feel OK I must be OK, the fact is I'll probably still feel OK on the day they tell me I have three months left. I'll feel like this on the day I go to hospital and hear that it's returned (if you write that, I'll get another million letters and emails telling me I do myself no good by looking on the bad side. But there is no other side to look on.) And I know that the last few weeks will probably be pretty nasty, although I intend spending much of that time as doped up as I can.' </p> <p>Although he has mostly 'put his affairs in order', and although he writes about his mortality, he never imagines life going on after he has died: never pictures the familiar landscape, but without him in it. 'One of the mad emailers' obsessions is - I quote - who's going to be banging Nigella after I've stopped. It really doesn't worry me. As far as I'm concerned, as long as I'm slightly tepid in the grave I'd hope she'd get round to it as soon as possible - metaphorically and literally. </p> <p>'Absolutely the most painful thing' about the whole business, 'the one I really can't bear thinking about', is the children. 'Cosima knows that I have cancer but she doesn't know what the prognosis is. She is quite used to my honking self and told me not long ago that she can't remember what I was like before. Bruno still asks me every so often if I am still ill, by which he means will my voice come back, but neither of them is particularly conscious that I'm different from other daddies.' </p> <p>John Diamond receives thousands of emails and letters every week. He shows me the boxes full of letters - typed and mistyped, handwritten in various colours of ink, with pressed flowers stuck on to their flimsy pages, offering Christian comfort, alternative hopes, words of wisdom and folly and shared sadness. Some treat him as an agony uncle qualified to deal with the griefs of the world ('WHY?'); an agony uncle is the central character in the novel he is working on. Many are from people whose parents/siblings/friends died of cancer in the days when it was thought bad form to talk about it 'and now they say they have some idea of what their loved ones went through'. Many read him and write to him because he is like the scout, going on before us to where we know we will arrive one day; he sends us back dispatches from the last frontier. ('No,' he chastises me, 'I write about living, not dying'; his 'greatest fraud', he says, is pretending to know more about dying than the rest of us.) </p> <p>But some attack him for writing down all of his illness, dwelling on it, making public what was thought to be private, saying the C-word over and over again, talking of his nausea and his wounds and his phlegm and his fear. He clicks up an email for me: 'dear me diamond,' it begins, 'first I can't believe you have a website devoted to your tongue' and continues at length: 'self-possessed morbid version of eastenders... whingeing ad infinitum... totally middle-class, and you don't really want to know or see the true face of low-income disease... you make me puke... insanely self-indulgent... you're going on like a psychotic, a highly irritating one at that.' And the thing is, says John Diamond then, 'I can see his point.' It's hard not to fall for such a man. </p> <p>Some journalists have also attacked him for making death into a new sensationalist genre. When the TV cameras followed him on his hospital trolley, Nigella lying beside him, up to the operating theatre; when the camera watched them kiss and maybe that would be goodbye, some critics winced. Surely that was going a bit far? In The Modern Review, Decca Aitkenhead attacked the 'emotional pornography' of writers such as Oscar Moore (now dead), Ruth Picardie (now dead), Martyn Harris (now dead). 'Columns by dying strangers make you cry,' she wrote, 'but if you read a decent porn mag it will probably make you come.' She argued that the difference between love and pornography is the same as the difference between real grief and what she sees as a tourist trip to the profitable theme park of sorrow. These death columnists are colluding in a 'Gotcha!' or Oprah Winfrey style of journalism, where nothing is private, and even dying can be turned into soap opera. </p> <p>John Diamond cheerfully admits that for many readers he is writing a soap opera, and 'they're hooked, as they may be to The Archers' (except, of course, The Archers goes on and on, and his diary is heading towards brutal narrative closure). And, he agrees, he always wanted to be famous. But he does trenchantly tackle some of the central criticisms. 'Certainly,' he says, 'there are times when I want to forget the whole cancer thing - but which cancer patient doesn't? And there are plenty of times when I could do without being Mr Cancer, the editor's cancerous chum and the man who has cancer for a living. An old git was rounded up to write a knocking piece about me for the Mail a year or so ago, and referred to my \"exploiting\" my cancer as if I was flogging it by the bottle door to door, but it doesn't really feel like that. I probably get nearer the truth of me than I would the truth of somebody else going through it. Does that sound horribly defensive?' It seems reasonable that a man who makes his living writing about his life (with the supremely arrogant assumption that it stands as a metaphor for life in general) should carry on writing about it when that life gets interesting. </p> <p>The boundaries, he says, are of good taste and intrusion into the lives of Nigella and the children. And 'while Nigella is naturally a private person who tends to write even the most personal columns in the passive tense, I'm naturally one of those people who you sit next to on the bus who tells you their life story and shows you their appendix scar. This is not affectation: this stuff neither embarrasses me, nor do I regard it as particularly private.' </p> <p>I ask about the trolley scene on TV, which I had watched with some anxiety myself - is it really all right to spend your possibly last minutes alive being filmed? Is that a way to say goodbye? 'I don't know. Remember, I was medded up to the eyeballs. More to the point, when you're being sent down to undergo an operation which at the unlikely worst might kill you and which at best is going to change your life for the worst forever, it helps if you spend your last few minutes thinking about what the camera is doing rather than what the surgeon's about to do. (Not that I always get it right. The film was due to come out just as my book was coming out, and the publisher had asked me to give it a plug on camera. Rightly enough, the director made it clear that the BBC isn't in the game of product placement. But on the last day of filming, she asked me a question to which the legitimate answer was: \"As I say in the book...\" I held up the book to read from it, and found myself, for only the second or third time since diagnosis, weeping uncontrollably. But as I wept I found an intrusive thought hovering around: \"The book shot is bound to be kept in the final edit. No director of this sort of film ever passes up the opportunity to show a grown man crying.\" But, good for her, she left it out. It didn't add anything, she said, to the film.)' </p> <p>When the novelist and journalist Martyn Harris wrote two long features about the death that was hurtling through him, and then began a column about it, it was distressing and terrifying to read. Ruth Picardie's columns in The Observer were almost unbearable - like drawn-out howls of anguish. But John Diamond's writing is not depressing, although it can sting and shock. In its granular, acerbic, self-mocking way, it can be oddly comforting. He nods. 'The thing about Martyn, Ruth, Oscar, et al is that it happened so quickly. I think one of the only differences between me and them is that I've been doing this for three years now.' He grins sardonically. 'They were just dilettantes.' (One of the most unsettling pieces of honesty was when he admitted to being a bit jealous of Ruth, because she was dying more dramatically than him, as if she had somehow stolen his subject.) If he holds out some kind of comfort, he says, it is because he has endured; his approaching death has become familiar. He is no longer gripped by the terror that had hold of him once, and so neither are we. 'But ask me again a few days before I die.' </p> <p>He seems to have little self-pity and hates the kind of bogus compassion that floods some of the people who look deep into his shrewd eyes with 'that \"I do understand, I DO\" look'. He hates being regarded as some kind of saint just because he is dying young. He loves being famous but thinks he's got his fame by 'cheating' (after all, he didn't choose the cancer, it chose him). He says that he has not, in any profound way, changed - 'I'm exactly the same person, as far as I'm concerned. I have the same faults, the same worries, the same general inclinations. I'm no kinder or more tolerant, my will power is no greater, and I'm frightened by much the same things as I ever was. People assume that death hanging over my head would allow me to put things into perspective, but that's not how it works. I was driving an old friend to the station the other day. I'd not seen her for years and in the intervening time she'd been beaten up by an abusive husband and was going through the messiest divorce. Halfway through telling me this, she stopped and said \"But what am I saying. Compared to your troubles...\" But my troubles are - most of the time - as they ever were: why's that idiot driving in two lanes in front of me, why have I run out of clean socks, why have the papers not been delivered yet.' </p> <p>The most emotional he gets is when he talks about Nigella. He talks about glimpses of her beauty, with a beaming, pride-filled sadness. He talks about the way this is worse for her than for him - she has already been unlucky too many times in her life. Her mother died young of cancer; her sister died of cancer, too. It is as if there is a sniper in the garden, gunning down the people she loves best. 'And after all, she is the one who will be left with the detritus.' She is a reticent person, he says, and only occasionally shows what she is going through. She works as hard as she does so she doesn't have to think too hard about where her life is heading. When he first met Nigella, after his first marriage collapsed ('or rather, imploded'), she was a 'rather shy and introverted literary editor. She's come out so much in the last 10 years. I think it is partly having children, but in many ways I think it was very brave of her to marry me. If I say I was a risk, I don't mean there was a reason for her not to be certain of me. But because I was something of an unknown quantity, as it turned out, we seem to be pretty perfectly matched.' Was she a risk for him, I ask. 'Oh no. No,' he replies at once. He talks about her courage, her talent, her success. He is proud of her, with a pride that lights up his face. They have been together for 11 years. </p> <p>When I say that it must be surreal, him writing about dying while she (whose subjects include food and make-up, as well as politics) is writing about living, he doesn't agree. 'It doesn't worry me that the life we live is so surreal - actually, most of the time it isn't. We live like any other married couple with kids and a mortgage and the residents' parking to worry about. But then we find ourselves doing the glam media-couple shtick and it does feel odd.' He is quick to say that he is needed by her as much as she by him, and that neither do other friends regard him as a victim. 'Being needed grants me authenticity,' he says. In his gang, he is not the odd one out - though in the pub, when he is tossing alcohol down his open throat, he does look 'like a Russian sailor on leave'. </p> <p>People write to him offering him the comforts of religion. He is an agnostic, not an atheist, but closeness to death has brought him no nearer to God. He sometimes prays, but he doesn't ask for anything, 'except sometimes the ability to get through something. Usually - this sounds unbearably pious - I give thanks.' He mostly thinks when he goes, that's probably it. Sometimes he worries, in a 'mad and irrational way', about what would happen if he suddenly got cured: 'It would be something of an unsatisfactory ending of the story.' But he knows, of course, that he won't be cured. He knows he is dying; the story is coming to an end. Yet in the middle of death, he is living. </p> <p>John Diamond wipes his mouth with a handkerchief. 'And in a funny kind of way - call me Cleopatra (Queen of Denial)' - he glances over to see if I get the dreadful pun - 'I've never been happier.

      "bodyText": "We are all of us dying, of course. In the middle of life, we are in death. But some of us are dying more quickly than others. John Diamond is dying more quickly. Three months, he gives himself; maybe six months; a year, perhaps, even two if he has the luck he hasn't had so far. Who knows, he says with his nice, ironic shrug, the same shrug he gives when you ask him how he is: who knows? Not him. His cancer was diagnosed three years ago, and since then he's been slithering down the statistical slide, from the 90-something per cent chance of surviving to the going-on 100 per cent chance of not. He's been poisoned, blasted, had bits lopped off him, been in remission, felt lumps grow again, been given shreds of hope, had hope removed. He's lost his tongue, his voice, his middle-aged paunch, his sense of an assumed future. 'I am almost certainly dying,' he says, 'but I live as if I'm not. Not because I've discovered a great truth, but because it is the only possible way to live.' He's not Dennis Potter, rhapsodising over cherry blossom and life's unbearable beauty as he swigged liquid morphine. He's more like Philip Larkin, who said if you were really conscious of your mortality, you wouldn't be able to get out of bed in the morning. Life's not like a supermarket sweep, he says, when you have to frantically throw all the things you don't usually buy into your trolley, cram as much in before that final buzzer goes. He doesn't read the great novels or listen to the great operas he has never quite got round to. He procrastinates more than ever, misses deadlines, reads the same bad detective thrillers he always has, plays poker, cracks jokes, enjoys the things he used to enjoy. For one of the things John Diamond has learned - along with the vocabulary of cancer and the architecture of fear, the way to eat a pear without a tongue - is that you are always in the middle of your own life. In the midst of death, we are in life. John Diamond is a journalist, a writer and a one-time broadcaster. He used to make much of his living from his voice, 'gabby' he calls the person he used to be, but now has no voice - or not the kind of voice that he can go on radio with, to be witty and opinionated. It's a sparsely consonanted heave of sound from his throat, which family and close friends can understand but others have difficulty with. He is married to the journalist and cookery writer, Nigella Lawson, whose food he can no longer eat. He is not without a sense of irony about all of this, nor about how he has always wanted to be famous and now is famous for his cancer. The painful, funny column he writes about his cancer in The Times, the unsentimental, wry, sad book he wrote about it, the TV documentary that tracked him through diagnoses and operations - all these things have made him, he says, with his sardonic grin, Mr Celebrity Cancer. He sometimes feels as if he's 'landed the cancer franchise for the chattering classes'. One of the tricky things about interviewing John Diamond is that he's already asked himself the questions, made the criticisms, attacked himself in print (a diamond to cut a diamond). He writes about having cancer; he writes about writing about having cancer In the last column I read by him, he wrote about being interviewed and photographed by a Sunday paper - getting his word in first. I meet him at his lovely house in West London - lovely not just because it's big and light-filled and book-crammed, with a long green garden, but also because it is brimful of life. John Diamond is downstairs in the large kitchen, hub of the house, feeding lunch to his small son, Bruno. There is a fluid crowd of other people - the nanny; Nigella (who's upstairs, filming her latest cookery programme for Channel Four, she wanders in and out); members of the TV team; friends, who enter by way of the garden. 'It's like one of those mad sitcom houses with people popping in and out all the time,' says/writes John Diamond. Most of his side of our conversation is written down, either in his neat italic handwriting, or on his computer up in the study. 'It's like watching a French film with subtitles,' he replies, when I say I'm sure I could follow his speech. 'You're convinced that if there were no subtitles you could still understand it - but you (I) couldn't.' He is looking pretty good: thinnish in his jeans and silk shirt, pale, hair bleached off-white ('It's my perhaps-David-Irving-had-a-point look'). He keeps his mouth closed much of the time, even when he smiles, and this gives him a kind and secret air. His throat is circled with livid scars - he says that if he'd had all his operations at once, his head would have fallen off - and he lifts his shirt up to show me the puckered ridge running up his back, where he had muscle removed to replace the lower portion of tongue in his jaw. His body is like a battlefield. The Times used to call his diary the 'Diary of Courage', until he asked them to change it. People write to tell him how brave he is. He doesn't think he is brave - his book is titled C: Because Cowards Can Get Cancer Too . 'Courage implies some kind of choice in the way one behaves, and I am behaving the way I behave because that seems to be the way I behave. In any case, when people ask you what you do, you can't say: \"Oh, I write the Diary of Courage.\"' When you picture a man in his mid-forties, with two small children, who will probably die soon, who's been in and out of hospital under the knife, who has no tongue, can't eat, can't properly talk - well, that sounds pretty grim and scary. But John Diamond isn't grim. There is a feeling of lightness about him, and of zest. His days are spent writing his columns, or his play, or (more rarely) the novel he is working on, tossing coffee or his liquid gloop down his opened throat ('I have to throw it down in one go because without a tongue I can't move food from the front of my mouth to the back and thus down my gullet. I have learned to open my throat - I have no epiglottis to shield my windpipe - and pour it down rather as one might pour it into a bath'), smoking (the doctors agree the reasons for not smoking are irrelevant now, and smoking is the nearest he gets to eating - he tastes the cigarette; he savours it), seeing friends, getting stoned or drunk, not being scared. 'Because most of the time I'm not scared. I get on with life, not because I'm a fatalist, but because that's the most congenial way of dealing with things. Indeed, most of the time, I'm not conscious of dealing with anything. I think of myself as being in remission, and, therefore, as someone with cancer. But whenever I talk about still being cancerous, the doctors affect mock anger and tell me that I don't have it. What they mean is that I have it in such small quantities that it doesn't show up on the scanner, or didn't the last time they looked, at least. But it is remission. The six months' worth of chemo finished about nine months ago, and the average remission in the 25 per cent of people in my condition for whom chemo is useful stay clear for, on average, between three and six months, so to that extent I suppose I am bucking the trend.' In spite of his clear-eyed sense that his horizons have diminished to the rim of days around him, he has just bought himself a Palm Pilot and has entered dates up to August - when he is going to Edinburgh to direct the one-woman play he is writing for and with Maria McErlane, and to keep in touch with Victoria Coren's one-man play based on his columns. 'The thing is,' he says, 'most of the time I feel just like I ever did, except for the voice and the food. Every so often, though, I do get scared - mainly by the realisation that although I work on the hypothesis that because I feel OK I must be OK, the fact is I'll probably still feel OK on the day they tell me I have three months left. I'll feel like this on the day I go to hospital and hear that it's returned (if you write that, I'll get another million letters and emails telling me I do myself no good by looking on the bad side. But there is no other side to look on.) And I know that the last few weeks will probably be pretty nasty, although I intend spending much of that time as doped up as I can.' Although he has mostly 'put his affairs in order', and although he writes about his mortality, he never imagines life going on after he has died: never pictures the familiar landscape, but without him in it. 'One of the mad emailers' obsessions is - I quote - who's going to be banging Nigella after I've stopped. It really doesn't worry me. As far as I'm concerned, as long as I'm slightly tepid in the grave I'd hope she'd get round to it as soon as possible - metaphorically and literally. 'Absolutely the most painful thing' about the whole business, 'the one I really can't bear thinking about', is the children. 'Cosima knows that I have cancer but she doesn't know what the prognosis is. She is quite used to my honking self and told me not long ago that she can't remember what I was like before. Bruno still asks me every so often if I am still ill, by which he means will my voice come back, but neither of them is particularly conscious that I'm different from other daddies.' John Diamond receives thousands of emails and letters every week. He shows me the boxes full of letters - typed and mistyped, handwritten in various colours of ink, with pressed flowers stuck on to their flimsy pages, offering Christian comfort, alternative hopes, words of wisdom and folly and shared sadness. Some treat him as an agony uncle qualified to deal with the griefs of the world ('WHY?'); an agony uncle is the central character in the novel he is working on. Many are from people whose parents/siblings/friends died of cancer in the days when it was thought bad form to talk about it 'and now they say they have some idea of what their loved ones went through'. Many read him and write to him because he is like the scout, going on before us to where we know we will arrive one day; he sends us back dispatches from the last frontier. ('No,' he chastises me, 'I write about living, not dying'; his 'greatest fraud', he says, is pretending to know more about dying than the rest of us.) But some attack him for writing down all of his illness, dwelling on it, making public what was thought to be private, saying the C-word over and over again, talking of his nausea and his wounds and his phlegm and his fear. He clicks up an email for me: 'dear me diamond,' it begins, 'first I can't believe you have a website devoted to your tongue' and continues at length: 'self-possessed morbid version of eastenders... whingeing ad infinitum... totally middle-class, and you don't really want to know or see the true face of low-income disease... you make me puke... insanely self-indulgent... you're going on like a psychotic, a highly irritating one at that.' And the thing is, says John Diamond then, 'I can see his point.' It's hard not to fall for such a man. Some journalists have also attacked him for making death into a new sensationalist genre. When the TV cameras followed him on his hospital trolley, Nigella lying beside him, up to the operating theatre; when the camera watched them kiss and maybe that would be goodbye, some critics winced. Surely that was going a bit far? In The Modern Review, Decca Aitkenhead attacked the 'emotional pornography' of writers such as Oscar Moore (now dead), Ruth Picardie (now dead), Martyn Harris (now dead). 'Columns by dying strangers make you cry,' she wrote, 'but if you read a decent porn mag it will probably make you come.' She argued that the difference between love and pornography is the same as the difference between real grief and what she sees as a tourist trip to the profitable theme park of sorrow. These death columnists are colluding in a 'Gotcha!' or Oprah Winfrey style of journalism, where nothing is private, and even dying can be turned into soap opera. John Diamond cheerfully admits that for many readers he is writing a soap opera, and 'they're hooked, as they may be to The Archers' (except, of course, The Archers goes on and on, and his diary is heading towards brutal narrative closure). And, he agrees, he always wanted to be famous. But he does trenchantly tackle some of the central criticisms. 'Certainly,' he says, 'there are times when I want to forget the whole cancer thing - but which cancer patient doesn't? And there are plenty of times when I could do without being Mr Cancer, the editor's cancerous chum and the man who has cancer for a living. An old git was rounded up to write a knocking piece about me for the Mail a year or so ago, and referred to my \"exploiting\" my cancer as if I was flogging it by the bottle door to door, but it doesn't really feel like that. I probably get nearer the truth of me than I would the truth of somebody else going through it. Does that sound horribly defensive?' It seems reasonable that a man who makes his living writing about his life (with the supremely arrogant assumption that it stands as a metaphor for life in general) should carry on writing about it when that life gets interesting. The boundaries, he says, are of good taste and intrusion into the lives of Nigella and the children. And 'while Nigella is naturally a private person who tends to write even the most personal columns in the passive tense, I'm naturally one of those people who you sit next to on the bus who tells you their life story and shows you their appendix scar. This is not affectation: this stuff neither embarrasses me, nor do I regard it as particularly private.' I ask about the trolley scene on TV, which I had watched with some anxiety myself - is it really all right to spend your possibly last minutes alive being filmed? Is that a way to say goodbye? 'I don't know. Remember, I was medded up to the eyeballs. More to the point, when you're being sent down to undergo an operation which at the unlikely worst might kill you and which at best is going to change your life for the worst forever, it helps if you spend your last few minutes thinking about what the camera is doing rather than what the surgeon's about to do. (Not that I always get it right. The film was due to come out just as my book was coming out, and the publisher had asked me to give it a plug on camera. Rightly enough, the director made it clear that the BBC isn't in the game of product placement. But on the last day of filming, she asked me a question to which the legitimate answer was: \"As I say in the book...\" I held up the book to read from it, and found myself, for only the second or third time since diagnosis, weeping uncontrollably. But as I wept I found an intrusive thought hovering around: \"The book shot is bound to be kept in the final edit. No director of this sort of film ever passes up the opportunity to show a grown man crying.\" But, good for her, she left it out. It didn't add anything, she said, to the film.)' When the novelist and journalist Martyn Harris wrote two long features about the death that was hurtling through him, and then began a column about it, it was distressing and terrifying to read. Ruth Picardie's columns in The Observer were almost unbearable - like drawn-out howls of anguish. But John Diamond's writing is not depressing, although it can sting and shock. In its granular, acerbic, self-mocking way, it can be oddly comforting. He nods. 'The thing about Martyn, Ruth, Oscar, et al is that it happened so quickly. I think one of the only differences between me and them is that I've been doing this for three years now.' He grins sardonically. 'They were just dilettantes.' (One of the most unsettling pieces of honesty was when he admitted to being a bit jealous of Ruth, because she was dying more dramatically than him, as if she had somehow stolen his subject.) If he holds out some kind of comfort, he says, it is because he has endured; his approaching death has become familiar. He is no longer gripped by the terror that had hold of him once, and so neither are we. 'But ask me again a few days before I die.' He seems to have little self-pity and hates the kind of bogus compassion that floods some of the people who look deep into his shrewd eyes with 'that \"I do understand, I DO\" look'. He hates being regarded as some kind of saint just because he is dying young. He loves being famous but thinks he's got his fame by 'cheating' (after all, he didn't choose the cancer, it chose him). He says that he has not, in any profound way, changed - 'I'm exactly the same person, as far as I'm concerned. I have the same faults, the same worries, the same general inclinations. I'm no kinder or more tolerant, my will power is no greater, and I'm frightened by much the same things as I ever was.

The only way to obtain a mint-condition identity, rather than an alias, is to build it from scratch. The most obvious method is to buy a dodgy passport from a man in a pub (\u00a3300-\u00a3500). One problem with this is that you probably don't know any members of the criminal underworld, and if you do, you know better than to trust them. A forged passport will not withstand close scrutiny; a stolen passport is useless. In 1998, more than 400 forged UK passports were discovered, and almost 150 were found in the hands of impostors.</p> <p>To get a new passport (\u00a328), you will need a birth certificate (\u00a311 from the Family Records Centre or your local register office) and a few photographs of yourself (avoid using mug shots). It is legal to send off for anybody's birth certificate, but it is a criminal offence to use it fraudulently. You will need to know the date of birth, name and locale of your new namesake. There is no system to cross-reference births and deaths, but you will want to minimise the chances of bumping into your alter ego, so it helps if they are deceased. One technique, popular with criminals in the 70s, was 'paper chasing'. This involved searching cemeteries for the gravestone of an infant born roughly at the same time you were.</p> <p>Once you have a birth certificate, other documents are easier to come by.

A Costa Rican driving licence can be obtained for \u00a310 (plus \u00a33 for a medical) within a day or two.

One problem with this is that you probably don't know any members of the criminal underworld, and if you do, you know better than to trust them. A forged passport will not withstand close scrutiny; a stolen passport is useless. In 1998, more than 400 forged UK passports were discovered, and almost 150 were found in the hands of impostors. To get a new passport (\u00a328), you will need a birth certificate (\u00a311 from the Family Records Centre or your local register office) and a few photographs of yourself (avoid using mug shots). It is legal to send off for anybody's birth certificate, but it is a criminal offence to use it fraudulently. You will need to know the date of birth, name and locale of your new namesake. There is no system to cross-reference births and deaths, but you will want to minimise the chances of bumping into your alter ego, so it helps if they are deceased. One technique, popular with criminals in the 70s, was 'paper chasing'. This involved searching cemeteries for the gravestone of an infant born roughly at the same time you were. Once you have a birth certificate, other documents are easier to come by. A driving licence will be \u00a323.50, although you will have to brush up on your mirror-signal manoeuvring. Unfortunately, it is essential to pay off all your debts. This might defy the point of a new identity, but debt collectors are a persistent sort. With valid paperwork, cosmetic changes are unnecessary, unless you plan to continue living in the same area. Invest in a new hairstyle (\u00a320) or coloured contact lenses (\u00a3240 per year). If you are abroad, then you might consider a foreign identity. A Costa Rican driving licence can be obtained for \u00a310 (plus \u00a33 for a medical) within a day or two. Of course the Holy Grail of international identities is Swiss - while it will open certain doors for you, other doors will be closed on anyone investigating you.

      "body": "<p>Sibling relationships are fuelled by competition and riven by comparison. While a great deal may rest on personality, circumstances and gender, the nearer you are in age to your brother or sister, the more acute the sibling rivalry is likely to be.</p> <p>When Cherie Blair gives birth to her baby, due at the end of this month, there will be a gap of 16 years between her first, Euan, and her last child. Her daughter Kathryn will be 12 and her second son Nicholas, 14. The relationship this youngest child has with its older brothers and sister will be entirely different from the relationship they have with each other. The Blair baby will be cossetted, adored and treated like a very special person, not only by its parents but probably by its siblings, as rivalry usually loses its potency as the age gap widens.</p> <p>'Sibling rivalry is usually for parents' affection, and in my clinical experience if there's a big gap they're still competing but they've got some distinction,' says David Spellman, a consultant psychologist who works with families. 'Possibly it's more tricky for the parents because there are so many facets to the task of parenting, but with the younger one, at least they've got experience to draw on and are probably better resourced financially.'</p> <p>The Blair baby will also feel in many ways like an only child. Everything it has will be new, since suitable clothes and toys will have been thrown out long ago. Just as the other three children are learning to exercise their independence, it will be locked into its parents' lives for many years to come - living, eating, holidaying alone with a mother and father old enough to be grandparents.</p> <p>Cherie Blair's pregnancy has invited copious comment, but once there was nothing unusual about late motherhood. In the late 19th century, sibling births spanned a generation, with new mothers often already grandmothers. American research shows that in the 20s, the average age at which women had their last child was 42, whereas now only 12 per cent of babies are born to women over 35. However, according to the Office of National Statistics, the most noticeable change in fertility over the past 20 years has been a shift towards later child-bearing. Significantly, since 1992 the number of 30- to 34-year-olds giving birth has exceeded the number of 20- to 24-year-olds giving birth. About 11,000 babies a year are born to women over 40, almost double the number 10 years ago, although still less than in the earlier part of the century.</p> <p>Thirty years ago, having a child in your forties was looked upon as a little weird - if not a little disgusting - but now, in an era where 55-year-old women can use IVF and egg donation to become pregnant, it isn't that unusual, especially among women who have held off having children for career purposes. Another reason why gaps between brothers and sisters are growing wider can be put down to the high level of divorce and remarriage. But what is less common is when children born to the same parents span a 10-, 15- or 20-year age gap.</p> <p>There are advantages and disadvantages to spreading your children out across the decades. For the mother and father, it can mean as many as 30 years of child-rearing, being bound at the hip to a toddler when your friends are rediscovering their freedom (not to mention the physical wear and tear on a body not designed for young children in middle age). On the other hand, there is nothing more likely to stop parents in their sixties from sinking into old age than having teenage children.</p> <p>For the youngest child, it can mean feeling isolated and spotlighted as 'special'; for the older child, a blurring of edges between parent and sibling.</p> <p>'As long as the older children have the message that they'll still be special and there's emotional preparation for the new arrival, there's no evidence to suggest that anyone should suffer,' says Barry Mason, director of the Institute for Family Therapy. 'In fact, often a newborn baby can make a difference to a child who's been difficult because they find themselves giving a lot of affection to the new child.</p> <p>'I know of no research that says having children a good few years apart is somehow bad.'</p> <p>David Spellman agrees.

It can be a very enriching experience for all concerned.'</p> <p>\u0095 Singer/songwriter Alissa Scott, 28, and her sister Sophie Scott, 15, live within two miles of each other in north London. Alissa is best known for her song 'Only Human', written for Dina Carroll; recently her debut single 'Easy For You to Say' won widespread acclaim. Sophie lives with her father and will be taking her GCSEs next year. Two months ago, their mother died after a 10-year battle with cancer.</p> <p><b> Alissa </b> As a child I remember always being on at my parents because I desperately wanted a brother or sister. I would plague them every day. But by the time I was 11, I'd given up. So I was completely shocked, at the age of 12, when my mother told me she was expecting another baby.</p> <p>Sophie and I are just like best friends nowadays, but I remember for the first two years of her life I was a bit jealous because suddenly all the attention went on to this beautiful little fair-haired thing. Even up until the age of eight she was a bit bossy because with Mum not being well it meant she wasn't able to discipline Sophie as much as she'd have liked to. My mum was 39 when she had Sophie and my Dad was 45, so they weren't that old, but when she got ill afterwards it obviously stopped them from having any more. Mum was very much a homemaker and loved having children round the house, but because of her illness it physically exhausted her.</p> <p>Our relationship has got closer as Sophie has got older because it's more equal now. I think this closeness is actually largely due to the age gap because there's nothing threatening about our relationship and no jealousy.</p> <p>We're so similar inside and view the world in exactly the same way. It's like a having a soulmate. We'll often go out together and our friends get on really well.</p> <p>Although I'm 13 years older, I don't feel the age difference at all. Perhaps because, being a musician, I'm not a conventional person, and also Sophie is incredibly streetwise and far more trendy than I ever was at that age.</p> <p>Since Mum died, I've tried to be a support to Sophie. I've wanted to be, so I've never felt weighed down by the responsibility, and we've both been able to comfort each other. Having a mother who was ill for so long and a much older sister has made Sophie very mature. She's a wise old soul.</p> <p>Mum's illness and death hasn't made our relationship closer, because we've always been close, but having a shared experience has definitely deepened our connection. Thank God we do have this closeness and thank God Sophie isn't an only child having to deal with the impact of her mother's death all on her own.</p> <p>At the moment I'm going home a lot more than before because we're all still trying to register what's happened. I need to be there for Sophie, and over Easter I took time out to make sure she had the school things she needed - Mum would have done that before. In the future, I'll have to integrate that kind of thing more into my life.</p> <p>I'm certain that having this age difference between us and being like a second mother to Sophie has taken away the broodiness other people seem to feel around my age. I know from direct experience the responsibility of bringing up a child, and therefore I don't want to get into it for at least another five years. I'm sure if it wasn't for Sophie, I'd probably be wanting babies by now.</p> <p><b> Sophie </b> I think my parents wanted the big age gap because they didn't want to be left without a child in the house. Alissa was like a second mum to me - she'd change my nappies, pick me up and throw me around. When I was five, she left home and I missed her terribly.</p> <p>I never wished that she was younger, but I did wish that she still lived with us. Now the gap has narrowed and we're closer than ever. We talk all the time and during these last few weeks, since our mother died, we've leant on each other a lot.</p> <p>I don't feel the age gap, because Alissa is very young at heart and when you love someone so much, the age doesn't make a difference. I find it quite cool having an older sister, especially one like Alissa. I'm just so proud of her. I've watched her music achievements over the years, seen her on TV and heard her on the radio. I've even asked her if one day she'll write a song about me.</p> <p>Perhaps our relationship is different to normal sibling relationships because Alissa has watched me grow up and blossom more in the way that a parent would than a sister. She's very young, 28, and so that's not really like a mother, but she's also a very motherly figure in my life and cares for me in a practical way.</p> <p>Mum was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was five, so Alissa has always helped out and been there for me. Perhaps knowing that Mum had this critical illness and could die one day made us closer as sisters, but I think we would have been very close anyway. At the moment I don't know what I'd do without her. I know it was a great comfort for Mum knowing we had each other. She used to say that by having us two girls she'd given each of us the perfect gift.</p> <p>\u0095 Cherry Payne, 53, is 21 years older than her brother, Paul Shearing, 34. They have always lived in the village of Herstmonceux in East Sussex. Cherry is a PCV coach driver and has two children, Karen, 34, and Kevin, 32. Paul is a company director, married with two small children.</p> <p><b> Cherry </b> After I was born my mother was told she couldn't have any more children, but when I was 15 she suddenly discovered she was expecting my first brother, David\u0085 in fact she found out practically on her due date! I was absolutely disgusted because I didn't think my parents did things like that.</p> <p>I knew my dad had always wanted a son and I felt very, very jealous. David was born at home, but I wouldn't look at him for the first 24 hours. I was just coming into puberty and this was the first time that anything had rocked my life.</p> <p>It was different when Paul came along five years later. By then I had moved out and I wasn't shocked or jealous. Ten months after Paul was born, I had my daughter, Karen, and they were brought up like brother and sister.</p> <p>The older Paul has got the closer we've become. We're two of a kind. He's always looked out for me, even though I'm the older one. When I was ill three years ago, he visited me in hospital every day and was there for me whenever I needed him. He'll still ring up to see how I am. Our lives are very much linked, and it was Paul who introduced me to my present husband.</p> <p>But it's never been a mother/son relationship. I think of Paul as my younger brother. Sometimes I feel the generation gap, but mostly having two younger brothers makes me feel younger than my age. In other ways, I think I lost out on a lot when I was a child. I feel envious of people who've got brothers and sisters closer in age because I was always on my own. I was treated like an only child and I felt like one, and sometimes it was difficult for me to mix with people because until David came along I was thoroughly spoilt.</p> <p>For Mum and Dad, having two little boys in their forties made their life as parents much longer and meant they didn't have much time together. I went the opposite way and had two children in my early twenties and within two years of each other. I didn't want a big age gap because I wanted to have some life of my own at the end of it.</p> <p>I've always been there for Paul, and when I lived alone before remarrying, he'd come and spend the evening with me and my children. He was a teenager, and he'd prefer to come to my house than spend it at home with our mum and dad. We'd go around like a little gang - I used to help look after David and Paul, and when Mum and Dad came to live near me, we'd mind all the kids together.</p> <p>Paul and I have the same interests. People must think we're quite weird sometimes because we look a different age, but they'll see us feeding the ponies or hanging the garden gate together. But I don't think it looks like an old lady with a young lad. In fact, only the other day I was mistaken for Paul's wife!</p> <p><b> Paul </b> In the early years, I thought of Cherry as another mother, especially because Karen and I were so close in age, and Cherry would look after us together. It's only lately that I've thought of her more as a sister. That's come about with age and since becoming more of an equal to her than I was as a child.</p> <p>I was never conscious of the age gap with Cherry because that was all I'd ever known, but I was very aware of it when it came to my parents because friends would automatically assume they were my grandparents.</p> <p>I was independent from quite a young age, possibly because Mum and Dad didn't want to do all the things that a younger son wants to do. So instead I'd do things with Cherry, which was much more fun. She'd take me along to parties and never tell me not to smoke or drink. I looked older than I was, and on my 18th birthday the landlord at our local pub was amazed because I'd been a regular for such a long time.</p> <p>Cherry had left home before I was born, and I spent much of my childhood with Karen and Kevin, who I thought of as a sister and brother. We were always together. Even now, to make life easier, I sometimes just tell people that Karen's my sister because it saves having to explain things.</p> <p>Having a big age gap has brought more benefits than disadvantages, mainly because it's made me closer to other members of my family - for instance, I wouldn't have had a sister who was initially more like my mother or a niece who is more like my sister.</p> <p>Cherry and I still live in the same village where our parents lived, and we still spend a lot of time together. We just get on very, very well. I don't feel the generation gap because she's incredibly young at heart. But that runs in the family. My mum's now in her eighties and behaves like a teenager half the time.</p> <p>\u0095 Patrick McCarthy, 59, and Mick, 43, were born 17 years apart. They both live in Jersey. Patrick is an accountant and Mick a gardener.</p> <p><b> Patrick </b> My mother always knew she'd have a late child to look after her in her old age because a fortune teller had told her. She wasn't unduly superstitious, but she had great faith that one day there would be two of us. I was home from school and walking up to the village with her one afternoon when she told me that I could expect a little sister. They wanted to call her Esmerelda. I was stunned by the news, and even more stunned by the name.</p> <p>My mother's intuition was wrong, and it was a huge relief when it turned out to be a boy. At first, Mick was a bit of a nuisance, but once he could walk and talk, I enjoyed playing with him. In some respects, we still do play together. We go to t'ai chi classes every Thursday, which I see as a direct extension to the play-fighting we did as children, or watching wrestling with our father.</p> <p>Mick's arrival was very good for our parents. My father died when Mick was still at school, and after that he looked after our mother. It was an enormous relief for her and, I have to admit, took the responsibility off me to a certain extent. I was married, with a home of my own, so it also meant that when she died, he inherited a property at the age of 23. My wife and I call him 'the orphan', which I suppose is slightly patronising, but shows a kind of pathos.</p> <p>We both went to boarding school and had similar experiences, and it was important that we could share those, but the age gap does create big differences. Our friends, for instance, are very different. His are a lot younger, and if we invite Mick over for one of our bridge evenings, he'll probably get bored. He imagines some of my friends to have rightwing views which he wouldn't sympathise with. Our music tastes are very different, too, and he loves surfing, which I regard as a kind of juvenile pursuit that has persisted into middle age.</p> <p>I always felt like an only child, and in a curious sense he was an only child, too - but an only child who had three parents. If there's just the pair of you, and especially if you're born far apart, you miss not having siblings your own age, and make more of an effort to cement the relationship with whichever sibling you can grasp.</p> <p>I've always felt very loving towards Mick, and very protective. I've never been envious of him, not even at the time when he was entering youth and I was leaving it - I guess because I was always too busy getting on with my own life. Being senior to Mick meant I could advise him and guide him, for instance, through his first job interview. Probably he's kept me young in a way that otherwise wouldn't be possible. Perhaps I've helped to make him old before his time.</p> <p><b> Mick </b> I liked the fact that when I was a child, Paddy would pick me up from school in his car. It seemed quite cool to have a much older brother. On the other hand, having older parents made me worry about their mortality, especially my father, who was very ill with emphysema for most of my childhood. He died when I was 14, at which point Paddy became halfway between a father and a brother. He taught me a hell of lot - weird stuff like military architecture or how birds build their nests.</p> <p>It must have been particularly hard for my father having this young son around. I was aware he was on the way out from when I about seven, and as time went on, it became more obvious that he had less and less time.</p> <p>For the 10 years after he died, I stayed with Mother. It was a sacrifice in a way, because she was ill and lonely and hit the bottle. Paddy was the smart one, but also his first wife didn't get on with our mother. In some ways, I regret having stayed at home for so long because I missed out on a lot of opportunities. But as a result I became closer to my mother, whereas Paddy became more distant. So something emerged between Paddy and me which was of neither of our making.</p> <p>I've always felt like an only child, which pisses me off, because I grew up very lonely, especially coming back to Jersey in the holidays. It meant there was water between me and my school friends, and water between me and Paddy. Paddy and his wife call me 'the orphan' - and it's true, I am. It's an affectionate term used when they feel they need to look after me.</p> <p>The biggest thing to change the course of my life has been having older parents who needed looking after. The fact that I had an older brother has, if anything, ameliorated that, because in some way he's stood in as a father and I've been able to rebel against him. Younger siblings, I imagine, have a more evenly matched struggle.</p> <p>So my attitude to Paddy is more like a rebellious teenager. I'll always do the opposite to what he does. If he locks his car, I'll deliberately not lock mine and make a big show of it, too.</p> <p>Paddy's stepped into the role of father somewhat reluctantly, and I wish he hadn't had to, because it's put an extra twist on our relationship, which has made it more difficult. Very often I've had flaming rows with him because he's tried to push me in a direction I don't want to go.</p> <p>The difficult thing for Paddy is that although our relationship is a bit like father and son, at the end of the day he isn't my father because he has no ultimate sanction against me, and I can tell him to get lost.</p>",

I'm sure if it wasn't for Sophie, I'd probably be wanting babies by now. Sophie I think my parents wanted the big age gap because they didn't want to be left without a child in the house. Alissa was like a second mum to me - she'd change my nappies, pick me up and throw me around. When I was five, she left home and I missed her terribly. I never wished that she was younger, but I did wish that she still lived with us. Now the gap has narrowed and we're closer than ever. We talk all the time and during these last few weeks, since our mother died, we've leant on each other a lot. I don't feel the age gap, because Alissa is very young at heart and when you love someone so much, the age doesn't make a difference. I find it quite cool having an older sister, especially one like Alissa. I'm just so proud of her. I've watched her music achievements over the years, seen her on TV and heard her on the radio. I've even asked her if one day she'll write a song about me. Perhaps our relationship is different to normal sibling relationships because Alissa has watched me grow up and blossom more in the way that a parent would than a sister. She's very young, 28, and so that's not really like a mother, but she's also a very motherly figure in my life and cares for me in a practical way. Mum was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was five, so Alissa has always helped out and been there for me. Perhaps knowing that Mum had this critical illness and could die one day made us closer as sisters, but I think we would have been very close anyway. At the moment I don't know what I'd do without her. I know it was a great comfort for Mum knowing we had each other. She used to say that by having us two girls she'd given each of us the perfect gift. \u0095 Cherry Payne, 53, is 21 years older than her brother, Paul Shearing, 34. They have always lived in the village of Herstmonceux in East Sussex. Cherry is a PCV coach driver and has two children, Karen, 34, and Kevin, 32. Paul is a company director, married with two small children. Cherry After I was born my mother was told she couldn't have any more children, but when I was 15 she suddenly discovered she was expecting my first brother, David\u0085 in fact she found out practically on her due date! I was absolutely disgusted because I didn't think my parents did things like that. I knew my dad had always wanted a son and I felt very, very jealous. David was born at home, but I wouldn't look at him for the first 24 hours. I was just coming into puberty and this was the first time that anything had rocked my life. It was different when Paul came along five years later. By then I had moved out and I wasn't shocked or jealous. Ten months after Paul was born, I had my daughter, Karen, and they were brought up like brother and sister. The older Paul has got the closer we've become. We're two of a kind. He's always looked out for me, even though I'm the older one. When I was ill three years ago, he visited me in hospital every day and was there for me whenever I needed him. He'll still ring up to see how I am. Our lives are very much linked, and it was Paul who introduced me to my present husband. But it's never been a mother/son relationship. I think of Paul as my younger brother. Sometimes I feel the generation gap, but mostly having two younger brothers makes me feel younger than my age. In other ways, I think I lost out on a lot when I was a child. I feel envious of people who've got brothers and sisters closer in age because I was always on my own. I was treated like an only child and I felt like one, and sometimes it was difficult for me to mix with people because until David came along I was thoroughly spoilt. For Mum and Dad, having two little boys in their forties made their life as parents much longer and meant they didn't have much time together. I went the opposite way and had two children in my early twenties and within two years of each other. I didn't want a big age gap because I wanted to have some life of my own at the end of it. I've always been there for Paul, and when I lived alone before remarrying, he'd come and spend the evening with me and my children. He was a teenager, and he'd prefer to come to my house than spend it at home with our mum and dad. We'd go around like a little gang - I used to help look after David and Paul, and when Mum and Dad came to live near me, we'd mind all the kids together. Paul and I have the same interests. People must think we're quite weird sometimes because we look a different age, but they'll see us feeding the ponies or hanging the garden gate together. But I don't think it looks like an old lady with a young lad. In fact, only the other day I was mistaken for Paul's wife! Paul In the early years, I thought of Cherry as another mother, especially because Karen and I were so close in age, and Cherry would look after us together. It's only lately that I've thought of her more as a sister. That's come about with age and since becoming more of an equal to her than I was as a child. I was never conscious of the age gap with Cherry because that was all I'd ever known, but I was very aware of it when it came to my parents because friends would automatically assume they were my grandparents. I was independent from quite a young age, possibly because Mum and Dad didn't want to do all the things that a younger son wants to do. So instead I'd do things with Cherry, which was much more fun. She'd take me along to parties and never tell me not to smoke or drink. I looked older than I was, and on my 18th birthday the landlord at our local pub was amazed because I'd been a regular for such a long time. Cherry had left home before I was born, and I spent much of my childhood with Karen and Kevin, who I thought of as a sister and brother. We were always together. Even now, to make life easier, I sometimes just tell people that Karen's my sister because it saves having to explain things. Having a big age gap has brought more benefits than disadvantages, mainly because it's made me closer to other members of my family - for instance, I wouldn't have had a sister who was initially more like my mother or a niece who is more like my sister. Cherry and I still live in the same village where our parents lived, and we still spend a lot of time together. We just get on very, very well. I don't feel the generation gap because she's incredibly young at heart. But that runs in the family. My mum's now in her eighties and behaves like a teenager half the time. \u0095 Patrick McCarthy, 59, and Mick, 43, were born 17 years apart. They both live in Jersey. Patrick is an accountant and Mick a gardener. Patrick My mother always knew she'd have a late child to look after her in her old age because a fortune teller had told her. She wasn't unduly superstitious, but she had great faith that one day there would be two of us. I was home from school and walking up to the village with her one afternoon when she told me that I could expect a little sister. They wanted to call her Esmerelda. I was stunned by the news, and even more stunned by the name. My mother's intuition was wrong, and it was a huge relief when it turned out to be a boy. At first, Mick was a bit of a nuisance, but once he could walk and talk, I enjoyed playing with him. In some respects, we still do play together. We go to t'ai chi classes every Thursday, which I see as a direct extension to the play-fighting we did as children, or watching wrestling with our father. Mick's arrival was very good for our parents. My father died when Mick was still at school, and after that he looked after our mother. It was an enormous relief for her and, I have to admit, took the responsibility off me to a certain extent. I was married, with a home of my own, so it also meant that when she died, he inherited a property at the age of 23. My wife and I call him 'the orphan', which I suppose is slightly patronising, but shows a kind of pathos. We both went to boarding school and had similar experiences, and it was important that we could share those, but the age gap does create big differences. Our friends, for instance, are very different. His are a lot younger, and if we invite Mick over for one of our bridge evenings, he'll probably get bored. He imagines some of my friends to have rightwing views which he wouldn't sympathise with. Our music tastes are very different, too, and he loves surfing, which I regard as a kind of juvenile pursuit that has persisted into middle age. I always felt like an only child, and in a curious sense he was an only child, too - but an only child who had three parents. If there's just the pair of you, and especially if you're born far apart, you miss not having siblings your own age, and make more of an effort to cement the relationship with whichever sibling you can grasp. I've always felt very loving towards Mick, and very protective. I've never been envious of him, not even at the time when he was entering youth and I was leaving it - I guess because I was always too busy getting on with my own life. Being senior to Mick meant I could advise him and guide him, for instance, through his first job interview. Probably he's kept me young in a way that otherwise wouldn't be possible. Perhaps I've helped to make him old before his time. Mick I liked the fact that when I was a child, Paddy would pick me up from school in his car. It seemed quite cool to have a much older brother. On the other hand, having older parents made me worry about their mortality, especially my father, who was very ill with emphysema for most of my childhood. He died when I was 14, at which point Paddy became halfway between a father and a brother. He taught me a hell of lot - weird stuff like military architecture or how birds build their nests. It must have been particularly hard for my father having this young son around. I was aware he was on the way out from when I about seven, and as time went on, it became more obvious that he had less and less time. For the 10 years after he died, I stayed with Mother. It was a sacrifice in a way, because she was ill and lonely and hit the bottle. Paddy was the smart one, but also his first wife didn't get on with our mother. In some ways, I regret having stayed at home for so long because I missed out on a lot of opportunities. But as a result I became closer to my mother, whereas Paddy became more distant. So something emerged between Paddy and me which was of neither of our making. I've always felt like an only child, which pisses me off, because I grew up very lonely, especially coming back to Jersey in the holidays. It meant there was water between me and my school friends, and water between me and Paddy. Paddy and his wife call me 'the orphan' - and it's true, I am. It's an affectionate term used when they feel they need to look after me. The biggest thing to change the course of my life has been having older parents who needed looking after. The fact that I had an older brother has, if anything, ameliorated that, because in some way he's stood in as a father and I've been able to rebel against him. Younger siblings, I imagine, have a more evenly matched struggle. So my attitude to Paddy is more like a rebellious teenager. I'll always do the opposite to what he does. If he locks his car, I'll deliberately not lock mine and make a big show of it, too. Paddy's stepped into the role of father somewhat reluctantly, and I wish he hadn't had to, because it's put an extra twist on our relationship, which has made it more difficult. Very often I've had flaming rows with him because he's tried to push me in a direction I don't want to go. The difficult thing for Paddy is that although our relationship is a bit like father and son, at the end of the day he isn't my father because he has no ultimate sanction against me, and I can tell him to get lost.",

She's one of 'those types', he says. She makes the kind of French arthouse fare he's dragged to by his partner: precious little dialogue, pensive expressions and ambiguous endings. Ah, that sort. </p> <p>Jacob is, after all, one of the darlings of European cinema. She has worked with three of the undisputed heavyweights - Kieslowski, Malle and Antonioni - and won the best actress award at the Cannes film festival when she was just 25. One imagines small talk and bouts of frivolity will not be on the menu today. </p> <p>But Jacob arrives with a ready smile and an instant handshake. During the interview she laughs frequently and talks quickly and passionately without apparent guile. At times her voice rings with girlish glee. </p> <p>She explains that her early roles were often 'unsatisfied' women. 'I was constantly offered parts that were very interiorised and things that were slightly tragic. I don't know why. I enjoyed doing those big, probing parts but that wasn't who I was at the time. I also really like comedy and recently I've got to do some different parts.' </p> <p>It was her two films with the late Krzysztof Kieslowski, the Polish existentialist, that set the standard. Both films, The Double Life of Veronique (1991) and Three Colours: Red (1994) explored themes of destiny and loneliness and saw the birth of the original Jacob persona: the chic, independent young woman prone to soul searching with an innate desire to connect. They were profoundly intimate performances. According to Jacob, though, there was no Method secret to the intensity of her speech and gaze. </p> <p>'The camera was really like a microscope. Krzysztof was always very close and very precise in his directions. It was not something he talked about beforehand; he would only work on the set. He liked to rehearse just before a take, if at all.' </p> <p>Her latest role in My Life So Far, starring Colin Firth and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, is definitely Jacob post-Kieslowski. In this amiable yet hardly substantive family drama set in the inter-war years, Jacob plays the elegant, spirited Gallic fianc\u00e9e who sets pulses racing amid a mildly eccentric Scottish gentry family. </p> <p>'I thought the character was very inspiring and liked the way she interacted very honestly with all the children,' she says. 'It reminded me of Au Revoir Les Enfants when I was the piano teacher and all the boys were inspired by me as the only woman in the place.' </p> <p>Her role in Louis Malle's heartfelt memoir about anti-Semitism came while she was still in drama school in 1987. Jacob had partially impressed Malle by telling him she could play the piano. On set, his direction was succinct. 'He told me to file my nails, yawn a bit and look into the distance and immediately the character was there,' she recalls. </p> <p>She was born in Paris but raised in Geneva by strict parents. 'I think we are in a generation where people talk to their children a lot and explain things to them but it wasn't like that then. The most important thing was having a good education.' So was Jacob's decision to leave home for Paris and drama school at 18 an act of rebellion? 'There are many reasons why I wanted to act but perhaps it's true that was one of them.' She gets more animated. 'You have to want to be an actor in spite of everything.' </p> <p>Her conversation is peppered with reference to Kieslowski. She speaks of him with great affection but denies being his confidante. He moulded her early career but he often kept her in the dark about the process. The actress initially felt little affinity with her character in Red and she found plenty of The Double Life of Veronique mystifying until she saw the finished film. </p> <p> 'He didn't like talking about a role,' she says. 'He felt that would impose a direction and not allow you to follow your instincts. If I asked him a question, he would say \"Well, you know it's more interesting for me to know what you think about it, or how would you answer it.\"' </p> <p>Afterwards, Hollywood came calling, but she turned down the lead role in Indecent Proposal because she didn't 'feel comfortable with the film's sensibility'. Her rare Hollywood excursions have been in small films (Incognito) or small roles in big films (US Marshals). Instead, she entered her 'English period'; an alluring performance as Desdemona in Othello (1995) and she was good in Mark Peploe's version of Conrad's Victory in the same year. </p> <p>Then there was Antonioni's Beyond the Clouds. The director had suffered a severe stroke but he still coaxed a beatific performance from Jacob as a rather austere young woman pursued on foot by a handsome suitor. And his most telling direction? 'He would just ask me to do bigger steps?' Excuse me? 'It sounds quite odd but you see by doing bigger steps you have a different energy,' she explains. </p> <p>She only appeared in one of the four vignettes in Antonioni's film, and it's clear Jacob still hankers for those 'big, probing parts'. At 34 she is well respected, works around the world and is undoubtedly a directors' favourite. But she is unwilling to make the choices and calculations that would lead to greater fame. Post-Kieslowski, kudos counts, but having fun is important too. She likes to play with her image and confound audiences. 'If I choose a part, it's because I'm moved by it and I like the director. It's only for that reason now. I have to be curious about the part whether it's nice, not nice, mean, jealous, generous, aggressive. Who cares? If it moves me, I'll do it.' </p> <p>\u0095 My Life So Far opens on 12 May</p>",

He took to his bed for 15 years to write In Search of Lost Time. Inside his cork-lined hermitage, he lived vicariously, reading seven newspapers a day and quizzing servants about the habits of the beau monde. Having completed the book, and wrecked his health in the process, he announced to his housekeeper that he was ready to die, and promptly did so. </p> <p>It is, as William C Carter makes clear, a hero's life, even though most of it was spent in a horizontal position. The recurring motif of this sympathetic and assiduous biography is the triumph of Proust's will. No one who knew him as an asthmatic, mother-fixated boy or a swishy, dandyfied young man credited him, as his classmate Daniel Halevy said, with 'the will to power to ever achieve a masterpiece'. </p> <p>The doubters were wrong. Despite his neurasthenia, Proust relished the year he spent in the army as a conscript, fought a duel when his literary achievements were impugned, and later took pride in the military daring of homosexual friends who fought in the 1914-18 war; he even compared the novelist - meaning himself - with a general who plots strategy and mobilises multitudes.

The insomniac Proust maintained a similar routine, and wilfully obliged others to accommodate themselves to the bizarre hours he kept. If he wanted to hear a string quartet, there was no question of going out in the evening to a concert. The players must come to him after midnight; more than once he drove through Paris in a carriage - swaddled in an eiderdown and scoffing mashed potatoes - to rouse them from their beds, extorting encores as dawn approached by stuffing their pockets with money. </p> <p>In 1917 military exigencies deferred to his whim as he corrected his proofs. He was in the habit of eating a nocturnal breakfast at the Ritz, but the blackout compelled them to switch off the lights at 9.30pm; Proust took his custom to the Hotel Crillon, next to the American embassy, where the use of electricity was permitted until 2am. </p> <p>His publisher called Proust 'the most complicated man in Paris'. Those who invited him to dinner were barraged in advance with a list of demands, mostly involving the prevention of draughts or the provision of Evian water and hot-water bottles. His world collapsed if he could not locate a certain safety pin which he fastened to his underpants: he believed that it 'kept his abdomen in and prevented stomach aches'. His fear of germs - and his ritualised retreat from the soiling transactions of the real world - meant that he would read letters only if they had been disinfected by formaldehyde for two hours. </p> <p>But there was method in this fussy, infuriating madness. Proust was creating the conditions necessary for his artistic work, turning disabilities to advantage. Take, for instance, his visits to the male brothel which he supposedly bankrolled. One young man he often chose from the line-up was asked to undress, stand by the door and masturbate while Proust, tucked in bed with the sheet prudishly drawn up to his chin, did likewise. It sounds commendably safe, but more than that it served the purpose of research: for Proust the novelist was an observer, not a participant. His fascination with the will made him curious about sado-masochism, which is a theatre of power. For an extra fee, the brothel keeper allowed him to watch through a concealed window while a nobleman from the provinces was chained to the wall and flogged. </p> <p>Martyred to his art, Proust accepted the self-denials it enjoined. But what fuelled his sessions of nocturnal work? Carter horrifyingly documents the drug abuse which for Proust was a vocational necessity. He insisted on medicating himself for imaginary ailments, and 'consumed huge quantities of caffeine in pill form, laced with bromide as a corrective to coffee's stimulation properties'. Once he carelessly swallowed 70 times the prescribed quantity of Veronal.</p> <p>Towards the end of his life, he overdosed on dry adrenaline, and scorched his digestive tract.

It is 1821, and in Kidney's reluctant and sometimes indifferent parish in Hobart, Tasmania, two freakish births have taken place - a foal with a single horn and no front legs, and a strange creature like a seal pup, with fur, flippers and whiskers, born to a young woman. </p> <p>The foal dies, but the pup thrives, and news of its existence spreads like a stain.

She and the boy had been living together in an awkward complicity, but then Mesud returned and forced her to give him up for adoption. </p> <p>Mette becomes fixated with this child, partly because she is childless and partly because she knows that the terrible effects of war are inherited.

Though many Scots learnt their country's history from Sir Walter, Robert Louis and Nigel Tranter before it was properly taught in any schoolroom, these days we know wearily what to expect. It will be the atmosphere of damp kilts steaming in the heather as another file of Englishmen, bayonets or spears (depending on the era), glinting in the early spring sunlight, are seen making their way up the side of a burn where the ambush awaits them. The English, to be fair, have become just as bad - all those Napoleonic yarns, so many comforting boiled sweets in a fast-changing world. </p> <p>So it is a cheering thing to be able to welcome a serious novel, mostly set in the 1670s, which has a lot to say about Scotland today, enmeshed in a homophobic backlash over Section 28 and half out of love already with the new Parliament on Edinburgh's Mound. This is a book which jostles its way into that select company of historical novels which have nothing to do with patriotic escapism - books such as Robin Jenkins's stunning The Awakening of George Darroch and the Neil Gunn/Naomi Mitchison political histories of the 1930s. </p> <p>Above all, it harks back to that most influential of novels about Scottish presbyterianism, James Hogg's Confessions of a Justified Sinner. Here, however, there is more sympathy for the cause. The fanatic of the title is a would-be Presbyterian assassin, on the run for the attempted murder of the Archbishop of St Andrews, James Sharp. The intellectual excitement of religious revolution and the coarse, pervasive cruelty of seventeenth-century Edinburgh is brilliantly caught, a kind of grimy Protestant Petrograd but one in which, eventually, the Tsar would win. </p> <p>The Presbyterian extremists, like the Leninists, seek refuge abroad (in the Low Countries), circulate violently incendiary underground leaflets, rely on safe houses and, when caught, endure revolting torture, the one-island gulag 'archipelago' of the Bass Rock prison and eventual execution in front of weeping crowds. Around this is the even darker tale of Scottish witch-hunting and burning and the utter corruption of the Restoration political \u00e9lite a few decades before the Act of Union; in Robertson's Edinburgh, the coming Enlightenment is barely a glimmer on the horizon. </p> <p>To recount this Scottish history now suggests a wish to warn and remind Scots of their darker side - historical fiction as destiny, not escapism. But Robertson is more explicit, by interweaving the 1670s with the late 1990s, when a ludicrous tourist 'ghost-trail' draws contemporary characters into the old stories just as New Labour's home rule revolution is on the horizon. The modern sections of the book feature another fanatic, an impoverished, semi-paranoid student intellectual, ranting into his mirror and increasingly obsessed with the martyred Presbyterian. He, too, is a type, a self-pitying Doric-Dostoevskian figure. </p> <p>It's a novel, not a tract, and there is no 'message', but it is hard to finish this remarkable book without a strong sense that Scotland is darker and less glibly liberal than the establishment likes to think. It is, in many ways, more like Russia than England, or at least it has been so. And, perhaps most revealing of all, Robertson seems to prefer it that way. His contemporary characters are not happier than his seventeenth-century ones; lacking faith and heroic commitment, they are shallow drifters, more ghostly than the ghosts of their ancestors. If you want to understand why the Scots and Middle England will never get on, this is a better place to start than any work of politics.</p>",

This is a book which jostles its way into that select company of historical novels which have nothing to do with patriotic escapism - books such as Robin Jenkins's stunning The Awakening of George Darroch and the Neil Gunn/Naomi Mitchison political histories of the 1930s. Above all, it harks back to that most influential of novels about Scottish presbyterianism, James Hogg's Confessions of a Justified Sinner. Here, however, there is more sympathy for the cause. The fanatic of the title is a would-be Presbyterian assassin, on the run for the attempted murder of the Archbishop of St Andrews, James Sharp. The intellectual excitement of religious revolution and the coarse, pervasive cruelty of seventeenth-century Edinburgh is brilliantly caught, a kind of grimy Protestant Petrograd but one in which, eventually, the Tsar would win. The Presbyterian extremists, like the Leninists, seek refuge abroad (in the Low Countries), circulate violently incendiary underground leaflets, rely on safe houses and, when caught, endure revolting torture, the one-island gulag 'archipelago' of the Bass Rock prison and eventual execution in front of weeping crowds. Around this is the even darker tale of Scottish witch-hunting and burning and the utter corruption of the Restoration political \u00e9lite a few decades before the Act of Union; in Robertson's Edinburgh, the coming Enlightenment is barely a glimmer on the horizon. To recount this Scottish history now suggests a wish to warn and remind Scots of their darker side - historical fiction as destiny, not escapism. But Robertson is more explicit, by interweaving the 1670s with the late 1990s, when a ludicrous tourist 'ghost-trail' draws contemporary characters into the old stories just as New Labour's home rule revolution is on the horizon. The modern sections of the book feature another fanatic, an impoverished, semi-paranoid student intellectual, ranting into his mirror and increasingly obsessed with the martyred Presbyterian. He, too, is a type, a self-pitying Doric-Dostoevskian figure. It's a novel, not a tract, and there is no 'message', but it is hard to finish this remarkable book without a strong sense that Scotland is darker and less glibly liberal than the establishment likes to think. It is, in many ways, more like Russia than England, or at least it has been so. And, perhaps most revealing of all, Robertson seems to prefer it that way. His contemporary characters are not happier than his seventeenth-century ones; lacking faith and heroic commitment, they are shallow drifters, more ghostly than the ghosts of their ancestors. If you want to understand why the Scots and Middle England will never get on, this is a better place to start than any work of politics.",
