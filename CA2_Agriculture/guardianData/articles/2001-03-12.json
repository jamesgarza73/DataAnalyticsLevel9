Despite years of experience in dealing with shareholder protesters at Barclays, Tuke provoked uproar when he cut short the RTZ meeting. After a stream of questions about the group's uranium mining in Namibia, then regarded as illegally controlled by South Africa, the chairman swiftly called an end to questions and declared the meeting closed.</p> <p>Angry shareholders still waiting to ask questions included two Aborigines who had travelled from Australia to raise the issue of land rights. Protesters rushed the stage, attempting to grab microphones in order to press forward their points, as the directors quickly escaped.

In a different context, however, as chair of the fundraising group backing British athletes at the Moscow Olympics in 1980, he supported Margaret Thatcher's boycott call when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.</p> <p>This international politicking was a long way from his roots and the bulk of his life. Educated at Winchester College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, Tuke continued a traditional path into the Scots Guards during the second world war. It was during the war that he met his wife Emilia, in Yugoslavia.</p> <p>After the war, Tuke joined Barclays which, despite its size, was virtually a family firm. The bank had been founded at the end of the 19th century through a merger of six family-controlled banks, and was still controlled by the founding families, something which continued into the 1990s. The Tukes were one of those families and both Tuke's father and grandfather had chaired the bank before he did.</p> <p>Tuke began working in branches in London's West End, and spent a brief spell in South Africa before moving up the managerial ladder in Luton and Birmingham. He joined the board in 1965, with responsibilities particularly for international business, and became chairman in 1973.</p> <p>He was knighted in 1979, towards the end of his spell in charge of the bank.

He was a great believer in the power of plastic cards and oversaw the rapid expansion of Barclaycard as the leading British credit card of the time.</p> <p>Both his strategic thrusts were briefly successful, making Barclays Britain's biggest bank for a while.

I told the boys this morning of the danger they were facing and what kind of game it would be.\" </p> <p>Yes, it was a proper cup tie, with rampant underdogs and panicked superstars and dizzying changes of fortune. Nobody quite knows what the Cup means any more, but this was the genuine article. </p> <p>So do we take yesterday's match at Prenton Park, and the one on Saturday at Filbert Street, as evidence that the competition is alive and well, and still capable of bestowing its particular form of immortality? Or does the anticlimactic affair at Highbury, in which one manager left his best goalscorer and his midfield general on the bench while his opposite number appeared to have his mind on other priorities, give us a truer sense of the tournament's depreciated value? </p> <p>These questions came to the fore once Manchester United skipped last season's competition. Although United's absence could have been accepted as a harmless one-off, its effect was to place a question mark, for the first time, against the status of the Cup. Similarly, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's decision to give Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira a rest against Blackburn could easily have been accepted as a perfectly understandable piece of footballing realpolitik, given his club's commitments. Instead it sent a different message. </p> <p>But the tournament of Stanley Matthews and Bert Trautmann, of Roy Dwight and Ian Porterfield, is fighting back. Who could have imagined at the beginning of the season that Lawrie Sanchez, scorer of Wimbledon's winning goal against Liverpool in 1988, would be facing the same club as a manager in a semi-final in 2001? Or that George Graham, a winner as a player and a manager with Arsenal, would be facing his old club in the other semi-final in command of their bitterest rivals? Or that victories in those two matches for the presumed favourites, Liverpool and Arsenal, would match two French managers in an FA Cup final to be played in Wales? Such things ensure this year's competition will add to the store of memories. </p> <p>\"There are no underdogs at this stage,\" Houllier briskly remarked on the prospect of a meeting with Sanchez's team. \"What Wycombe achieved against Wimbledon and Leicester shows we've got to be extremely up for it. If we play well on the day, if we have a good game, maybe we will go through.\" </p> <p>And if they continue to play as they did for most of yesterday's second half, which is the way they played in passages recently against Birmingham in Cardiff and against Roma at Anfield, sooner or later Houllier's team will come a big and painful cropper. \"We didn't take Tranmere lightly,\" the Frenchman said, which was true. But the Nationwide League team were restricted to two goals only by a considerable amount of luck, because of the Liverpool defence's inability to play the ball out of their zone with any accuracy and to the midfield's failure to hold it and move it around with any fluency. As a result, Sami Hyypia and Markus Babbel were constantly on the back foot. </p> <p>But, the result apart, Houllier had a reason to be proud. \"Did you see something about the team?\" he asked. What he meant was that there were seven Englishmen in the starting line-up, all aged 26 or under, and four of them scored the goals. The lesson the rest of us can take is that, even in the modern world, tradition and progress can still go hand in hand.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Or that George Graham, a winner as a player and a manager with Arsenal, would be facing his old club in the other semi-final in command of their bitterest rivals? Or that victories in those two matches for the presumed favourites, Liverpool and Arsenal, would match two French managers in an FA Cup final to be played in Wales? Such things ensure this year's competition will add to the store of memories. \"There are no underdogs at this stage,\" Houllier briskly remarked on the prospect of a meeting with Sanchez's team. \"What Wycombe achieved against Wimbledon and Leicester shows we've got to be extremely up for it. If we play well on the day, if we have a good game, maybe we will go through.\" And if they continue to play as they did for most of yesterday's second half, which is the way they played in passages recently against Birmingham in Cardiff and against Roma at Anfield, sooner or later Houllier's team will come a big and painful cropper. \"We didn't take Tranmere lightly,\" the Frenchman said, which was true. But the Nationwide League team were restricted to two goals only by a considerable amount of luck, because of the Liverpool defence's inability to play the ball out of their zone with any accuracy and to the midfield's failure to hold it and move it around with any fluency. As a result, Sami Hyypia and Markus Babbel were constantly on the back foot. But, the result apart, Houllier had a reason to be proud. \"Did you see something about the team?\" he asked. What he meant was that there were seven Englishmen in the starting line-up, all aged 26 or under, and four of them scored the goals. The lesson the rest of us can take is that, even in the modern world, tradition and progress can still go hand in hand. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>And the Spurs go marching on. At least they do in the FA Cup, where the Pioneer Corps' buckets and shovels of their Premiership season continue to be replaced by a bit of Coldstream spit and polish. </p> <p>A victory for tactical nous, sound organisation and a combination of nerve and verve took Tottenham to the semi-finals after an enthralling sixth-round tie against West Ham United here yesterday. Now Arsenal, the club with whom George Graham will always be most closely identified, stand between his present side and the first FA Cup final at the Millennium stadium in Cardiff. </p> <p>Spurs and their manager are now within sight of redemption for a disappointing season in the league. Yesterday their goalkeeper made the difference, two saves by Neil Sullivan in the closing minutes denying West Ham the replay their almost overwhelming pressure appeared certain to bring. </p> <p>These and the instinctive finishing of Sergei Rebrov played a considerable part in Tottenham's victory. The little Ukrainian struck once in each half to throw West Ham on to the back foot just when they appeared to be taking control. </p> <p>When Gary Doherty gave Spurs a 3-1 lead half an hour from the end this absorbing contest appeared to have taken a decisive turn. But after Svetoslav Todorov, West Ham's Bulgarian substitute, had scored with 18 minutes remaining the excitement reached an even higher pitch. </p> <p>Having beaten Manchester United and Sunderland in away ties to reach the quarter-finals West Ham were a popular choice to go on to the final. That they did not was due in no small measure to Graham's enduring habit of employing the right tactics for the big occasion, a quality which brought Arsenal two championships and much more besides during his nine years at Highbury. </p> <p>Tottenham set out to deny Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Frank Lampard time on the ball and space to use it as effectively as they had done at Old Trafford and the Stadium of Light. So well was the job done that for half an hour West Ham were reduced to humping the ball long towards Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, easy stuff for Sol Campbell to deal with. </p> <p>By no means are the present Tottenham team a pretty sight but yesterday's performance was undeniably impressive, with Steffen Freund dogging the footsteps of Cole and Stephen Clemence and Ledley King rarely giving Lampard or Carrick a chance to establish lines of communication. </p> <p>On the flanks Steffen Iversen and Luke Young frequently exploited West Ham's lack of natural width and in the middle Les Ferdinand gave an ample demonstration of classic centre-forward play, winning much in the air and working tirelessly to bring those around him into attacking movements. </p> <p>Poor defending by West Ham contributed to each of Tottenham's goals but Harry Redknapp's side should have been alerted to the likely consequences of slackness at the back in the 11th minute when Rebrov seized on an error by Igor Stimac before driving the ball over the bar. As it was the lesson went unheeded. </p> <p>After 29 minutes a centre from Freund on the right reached Young, whose header beat Hislop but hit the outside of the far post. Another minute and a prodigious throw from Freund, from the left this time, found Rebrov unmarked and his sweetly struck volley put Tottenham ahead. </p> <p>A rocket of a low drive from Stuart Pearce, superbly struck after a tapped free-kick from Paolo di Canio had been stunned by Lampard, sent West Ham in at half-time with a new spring in their step and had Kanout\u00e9 not wastefully shot wide on the resumption Pearce might still be looking forward to another final at the age of 39. </p> <p>As it was Spurs scored twice more in five minutes around the hour. First Ferdinand rose imperiously above Stimac and Pearce to nod Rebrov in for a shot through the goalkeeper's legs. Cole should have been picking the Ukrainian up and the youngster was again at fault when he failed to react at the far post as Doherty headed in from Rebrov's corner. </p> <p>Todorov, pouncing after Cole's pass had taken a ricochet off Young, restored West Ham's hopes but Sullivan preserved Spurs' lead, saving one-handed from Kanout\u00e9 and pushing wide Todorov's header as Upton Park finally ran out of bubbles. </p> <p>\"You can't give away three goals like that in matches like this,\" Redknapp complained, while Graham thought that \"we approached the game in the right way from the off\". Neither manager was wrong.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "And the Spurs go marching on. At least they do in the FA Cup, where the Pioneer Corps' buckets and shovels of their Premiership season continue to be replaced by a bit of Coldstream spit and polish. A victory for tactical nous, sound organisation and a combination of nerve and verve took Tottenham to the semi-finals after an enthralling sixth-round tie against West Ham United here yesterday. Now Arsenal, the club with whom George Graham will always be most closely identified, stand between his present side and the first FA Cup final at the Millennium stadium in Cardiff. Spurs and their manager are now within sight of redemption for a disappointing season in the league. Yesterday their goalkeeper made the difference, two saves by Neil Sullivan in the closing minutes denying West Ham the replay their almost overwhelming pressure appeared certain to bring. These and the instinctive finishing of Sergei Rebrov played a considerable part in Tottenham's victory. The little Ukrainian struck once in each half to throw West Ham on to the back foot just when they appeared to be taking control. When Gary Doherty gave Spurs a 3-1 lead half an hour from the end this absorbing contest appeared to have taken a decisive turn. But after Svetoslav Todorov, West Ham's Bulgarian substitute, had scored with 18 minutes remaining the excitement reached an even higher pitch. Having beaten Manchester United and Sunderland in away ties to reach the quarter-finals West Ham were a popular choice to go on to the final. That they did not was due in no small measure to Graham's enduring habit of employing the right tactics for the big occasion, a quality which brought Arsenal two championships and much more besides during his nine years at Highbury. Tottenham set out to deny Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Frank Lampard time on the ball and space to use it as effectively as they had done at Old Trafford and the Stadium of Light. So well was the job done that for half an hour West Ham were reduced to humping the ball long towards Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, easy stuff for Sol Campbell to deal with. By no means are the present Tottenham team a pretty sight but yesterday's performance was undeniably impressive, with Steffen Freund dogging the footsteps of Cole and Stephen Clemence and Ledley King rarely giving Lampard or Carrick a chance to establish lines of communication. On the flanks Steffen Iversen and Luke Young frequently exploited West Ham's lack of natural width and in the middle Les Ferdinand gave an ample demonstration of classic centre-forward play, winning much in the air and working tirelessly to bring those around him into attacking movements. Poor defending by West Ham contributed to each of Tottenham's goals but Harry Redknapp's side should have been alerted to the likely consequences of slackness at the back in the 11th minute when Rebrov seized on an error by Igor Stimac before driving the ball over the bar. As it was the lesson went unheeded. After 29 minutes a centre from Freund on the right reached Young, whose header beat Hislop but hit the outside of the far post. Another minute and a prodigious throw from Freund, from the left this time, found Rebrov unmarked and his sweetly struck volley put Tottenham ahead. A rocket of a low drive from Stuart Pearce, superbly struck after a tapped free-kick from Paolo di Canio had been stunned by Lampard, sent West Ham in at half-time with a new spring in their step and had Kanout\u00e9 not wastefully shot wide on the resumption Pearce might still be looking forward to another final at the age of 39. As it was Spurs scored twice more in five minutes around the hour. First Ferdinand rose imperiously above Stimac and Pearce to nod Rebrov in for a shot through the goalkeeper's legs. Cole should have been picking the Ukrainian up and the youngster was again at fault when he failed to react at the far post as Doherty headed in from Rebrov's corner. Todorov, pouncing after Cole's pass had taken a ricochet off Young, restored West Ham's hopes but Sullivan preserved Spurs' lead, saving one-handed from Kanout\u00e9 and pushing wide Todorov's header as Upton Park finally ran out of bubbles. \"You can't give away three goals like that in matches like this,\" Redknapp complained, while Graham thought that \"we approached the game in the right way from the off\". Neither manager was wrong. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>On Thursday, leaving my mum to sleep off any jet lag, I went to work early. I was so tired I was falling asleep on my feet, but I'd already made my first plan for that evening - surprise number one, if you like. By the time I finished work I had just long enough to get home, shower and change before heading straight out again - I was taking my mum to see a little known operetta, The Gypsy Princess, at Sydney Opera House. Despite my anxieties that we wouldn't make it on time - the lady who sold me tickets had warned me there would be no late admittance - we were fine. I'd never been to the Opera House before and it was quite an experience. The theatre itself was surprisingly small, but the production was enchanting. It was a lightweight romantic musical with fantastic costumes and sets. We both love a song and a dance, and it reminded me of being in school musicals. The moonlit view across the harbour during the interval was almost as magical as the show itself, and we both agreed it was a wonderful evening. &nbsp; </p> <p>Unfortunately I had to be at work early the next day. I'm starting to find this burning the candle at both ends business pretty exhausting. Still, I impressed myself by refusing to host - I do value my feet - so it was a pretty painless day. In the evening I took my mum to Darling Harbour to see if she'd be enjoy it as much as I do. She agreed with my that it was a lovely, lively area. We ate a cheap meal of moussaka and pasta, as my mum was suffering from what she called 'day two sickness'. After that we took an evening stroll round the city, only to be beaten eventually by the viciously heavy rain. &nbsp; </p> <p>On Saturday morning I had to drag myself into work again, although I was kept going by the prospect of a couple of days off. Besides, that night was one of the biggest nights in the Sydney calendar - the Mardi Gras! I finished work early, which was fantastic because it gave me time to buy a picnic and a box of wine before meeting my mum. From my months here I've learnt to come well-prepared for all big occasions. We headed down to the parade route pretty early so there'd be a chance of us actully seeing it, rather than just the backs of heads. For anyone who doesn't know, Sydney Mardi Gras involves one of the biggest gay and lesbian parades in the world. Thousand of people turn out to watch, dress up and generally go crazy for the weekend. We settled down with our wine, acquired some spangly headbands and enjoyed the parade. It was a fantastically colourful collection with highlights ranging from the in-your-face dykes on bikes through well co-ordinated dancers, the strongly cheered police section and some topless women on stilts who'd painted themselves green.&nbsp; It was a great evening, but one of those you definitely had to be there for, because of the tremendous atmosphere. Everybody was so friendly and all around there were rainbow flags, outrageous costumes, flying ticker-tape and exploding fireworks. Not an evening we'll be able to forget easily. &nbsp; </p> <p>I woke up at the Dive Hotel, which I cannot praise highly enough. It has funky, spacious rooms, a homely feel, a great location and a communal breakfast, all of which really sets it apart from other faceless hotels. I love Sunday afternoons and this one was no exception. The sun was shining brightly, so we headed to the beach to be lazy and watch a surf competition where the contestants battled with dangerously large waves. In the evening we went out for dinner at Pacific Seafood Restaurant in Coogee. Before I left, Brian told me to eat swordfish for him, so I thought it would be rude not to. For those who have never tried it, it's a meaty fish which tastes almost like smoked chicken! My mum had barramundi, which was more like fish and chip shop haddock, but it was all delicious. We also went all-out with dessert and coffee, so that I could give a really professional opinion of the place. I would say it does lovely meals which aren't too pricey, and if you like fish you'll love this place. Now I feel like a young female Michael Winner (or the Guardian equivalent..!)</p> <p>That night, a raging storm kept us awake which was unfortunate as Monday was the day of my second surprise - a Wonderbus day tour which included a dolphin-watching cruise and the Hunter Valley. We almost decided not to go, but somehow made it to Circular Quay for 7am - 30 minutes late. It didn't matter though because our Wonderbus (the wonder is how it gets anywhere...) was late too. Despite driving at breakneck speed in a bus with the world's worst suspension we still managed to arrive late at Port Stephens, where we boarded a catamaran in an attempt to see some dolphins. The captain seemed a little pessimistic about our chances, but towards the end of the day we were rewarded with the beautiful sight of&nbsp;two mother and baby bottlenoses arching gracefully through the water with perfect synchrony. I know there are dolphins off Swanage, but they're still beautiful. </p> <p>After this we made it uneventfully to Oakdale Nature Farm where we could interact with various animals from sleepy koalas to tame kangaroos, vicious emus and a goat by the name of Billy who would not stop crying when we left (<a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399240,00.html\">look at Milly's photo gallery</a>). There were five entertaining and outspoken gay men on our bus, and they adopted Billy as their mascot. Our last stop was the Hunter Valley and this was where our driver got hopelessly confused - and my mum ended up helping him with directions. By the time we'd driven all round the area we had about 10 minutes in a couple of estates before being shepherded back onto the bus again. The driver was teased something awful all the way back, but at least it made for an amusing and again unforgettable day. It also made me decide against trying any more tours of this type, as all I wanted to do was to have a relaxed stroll round the vineries, which unfortunately wasn't to be... &nbsp; </p> <p>On Tuesday I had to rise early for work - it turned into a long day but I wasn't particularly concerned as tomorrow was surprise number three, and gave me three whole days off! &nbsp;</p> <p> Moving swiftly on to Wednesday's surprise - we were off on the plane to Melbourne! It's only a short flight, and the fares are brilliant at the moment. I was also really looking forward to a change of scenery from Coogee, much as I love the place. We were actually staying in St. Kilda's, which is just out of the city although easily accessible by tram - Melbourne's primary source of public transport. Neither of us were quite prepared for how hot it would be compared to Sydney and at first we were disheartened, especially as the beach at St Kilda's was nothing to write home about. Then we headed for the Royal Botanical Gardens, complete with fruit bats exactly like the one in Sydney, and simply relaxed in the shade under a big tree. After this we felt inspired to explore, and found that Melbourne is absolutely lovely. We walked beside the wide Yarra River with its many active rowers stopping at the giant Southbank plaza for a smoothie. Just on the opposite side of the river lay central Melbourne, with its interesting skyline and grid street layout (<a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399240,00.html\">look at Milly's photo gallery</a>). We wandered around the city simply looking about before heading home to try and find some dinner. Eventually we decided all we wanted was fruit and wine and I was very pleased to return to our apartment for food and a shower - long may these work-free, sunny days last!</p> <p>Until next week, Milly &nbsp;</p>",

Neil Blackley, the influential media analyst at Merrill Lynch who first highlighted the weakness of ITV advertising revenues last year, today said the advertising downturn \"is far worse than expected.\" The Merrill team estimated in a note that advertising revenues for May and June could fall by 13% and 16% respectively, which would make a recovery impossible in the second half of the year. Even if revenues pick up in between July and December, advertising is expected to fall by 1% compared to last year. It is bad news for ITV giants Granada and Carlton Communications, which have been hit by the collapsing advertising spend of dotcom start-ups and the fall in meat advertising due to the foot nad mouth crisis. The Merrill team added that \"it is now inevitable that ITV will go on satellite before the end of the year.\" Granada and Carlton's shares were barely affected by the news, as it has been widely predicted that the ITV advertising recession would last all year.",

It would be a privilege to withhold it. \u0095 Roy Hattersley is a member of the House of Lords. comment@theguardian.com",

      "byline": "Peter Hetherington",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>My daily walk to work takes me from a redeveloping neighbourhood in a big northern conurbation, past rubble-strewn wastelands which housed the metal bashers and mill workers of the world's first industrial city, down eerie underpasses below expressways which plough through former communities - and into the centre itself. In barely a mile, I leave new houses valued at little more than \u00a350,000 before hitting trendy, canal-side loft apartments which can sell for up to a \u00a31m. Manchester city centre, like the cores of Leeds, Newcastle and - increasingly - Liverpool, is thriving. Developers are falling over themselves to buy old mills and workshops written off as worthless 10 years ago. Everyone, from exclusive retailers to expensive restaurateurs, wants in.</p> <p>But, as a report undertaken for the Guardian by Professor Brian Robson of Manchester University says, cheek by jowl with the new penthouses, restaurants, and up-market stores, lies \"the land of the forgotten ... the endless rows of impoverished terrace housing and half empty council housing where unemployment is horrendous, where houses sell - if at all - for under \u00a310,000, where crime ... traps people in their homes, where drugs are common currency...\"</p> <p>Northern cities are increasingly characterised by the reverse of the north American \"doughnut\" phenomenon, in which original city centres become hollowed out and deserted. In Britain's north, vibrant rebuilt centres are surrounded by wastelands, with many trapped in a cycle of negative equity.</p> <p>A long the M62 corridor, from Liverpool to Manchester and the Lancashire towns, 280,000 homes (100,000 of them private properties) are blighted, according to recent research by Birmingham University. The wider north-west already has more derelict land than anywhere else in the country - tens of thousands of acres eminently suitable for redevelopment.</p> <p>Ministers are now committed to an ambitious policy of neighbourhood renewal, with a promise to pump hundreds of millions into deprived communities, linked to an array of performance targets. This all seems extremely promising. The government does take poverty seriously. But, as Brian Robson points out in his report, if government policy is now to focus on the neighbourhood and the general delivery of council services (fine for London, no doubt), it will miss some of the main causes of poverty and deprivation it is trying to ameliorate in the north.</p> <p>Poor communities, he argues, do not emerge in a vacuum. Their fortunes reflect the wider economies of cities in which they exist.

      "bodyText": "My daily walk to work takes me from a redeveloping neighbourhood in a big northern conurbation, past rubble-strewn wastelands which housed the metal bashers and mill workers of the world's first industrial city, down eerie underpasses below expressways which plough through former communities - and into the centre itself. In barely a mile, I leave new houses valued at little more than \u00a350,000 before hitting trendy, canal-side loft apartments which can sell for up to a \u00a31m. Manchester city centre, like the cores of Leeds, Newcastle and - increasingly - Liverpool, is thriving. Developers are falling over themselves to buy old mills and workshops written off as worthless 10 years ago. Everyone, from exclusive retailers to expensive restaurateurs, wants in. But, as a report undertaken for the Guardian by Professor Brian Robson of Manchester University says, cheek by jowl with the new penthouses, restaurants, and up-market stores, lies \"the land of the forgotten ... the endless rows of impoverished terrace housing and half empty council housing where unemployment is horrendous, where houses sell - if at all - for under \u00a310,000, where crime ... traps people in their homes, where drugs are common currency...\" Northern cities are increasingly characterised by the reverse of the north American \"doughnut\" phenomenon, in which original city centres become hollowed out and deserted. In Britain's north, vibrant rebuilt centres are surrounded by wastelands, with many trapped in a cycle of negative equity. A long the M62 corridor, from Liverpool to Manchester and the Lancashire towns, 280,000 homes (100,000 of them private properties) are blighted, according to recent research by Birmingham University. The wider north-west already has more derelict land than anywhere else in the country - tens of thousands of acres eminently suitable for redevelopment. Ministers are now committed to an ambitious policy of neighbourhood renewal, with a promise to pump hundreds of millions into deprived communities, linked to an array of performance targets. This all seems extremely promising. The government does take poverty seriously. But, as Brian Robson points out in his report, if government policy is now to focus on the neighbourhood and the general delivery of council services (fine for London, no doubt), it will miss some of the main causes of poverty and deprivation it is trying to ameliorate in the north. Poor communities, he argues, do not emerge in a vacuum. Their fortunes reflect the wider economies of cities in which they exist. The challenge, then, is not to wait for that elusive \"trickle down\", but to act positively to channel city centre wealth to the outer ring. With government grants to town halls now skewed in favour of London and the south, because northern cities and conurbations are losing people, that task is not easy, although ministers are now - belatedly - considering switching some funds from south to north by revising a complex Whitehall spending formula. The government's equally ambitious regional agenda - creating eight development agencies (RDAs) and pushing up their budgets by \u00a3500m - has yet to have any impact because it was not quite clear what the RDAs were meant to achieve: the south-east RDA, for instance, sees its task as going for yet more growth at all costs to compete with the super-regions of Europe. It wants to keep the big corporate headquarters, and research labs along the M4 and around Oxford, with the less-favoured regions taking the more mundane back office functions. Such a policy, not surprisingly, has pushed regions such as the north-east - and the cities of the north - further down the prosperity league table. On the day that Professor Robson produced his report, government statisticians published even more sobering figures showing - yes -that the north-south divide had actually widened under New Labour.

But if the improvement in women's representation was pretty much universally applauded, one of the means by which it had been achieved was not. Most of the women, 101 of them, were Labour. Of the 65 new Labour women, 35 had been selected as candidates on the basis of all-women shortlists, the party's controversial policy of positive discrimination. They had been chosen before such shortlists were ruled illegal at a Leeds industrial tribunal in January 1996.</p> <p>But perhaps - it was thought after the election - all-women lists had been needed for only one parliament. Just as well: aside from the question of illegality, the policy had proved unpopular, generating divisions within the party.

It is possible, however, to compare selections in seats already held by the party.</p> <p>For the 1997 general election, Labour selected candidates for 39 seats in which a Labour MP had retired. Boundary changes made the situation a bit more complicated than usual: two constituencies were lost in the revisions, and sitting Labour MPs who needed new seats were selected in six. Of the remaining 31, 10 went to women. Selections took place in a further 12 seats created by the boundary changes that were considered to be Labour-held on a simulation of the 1992 general election. Of these seven went to women. In all, women took 17 out of 43 Labour-held seats, nearly 40%. Seven of these candidates were chosen from all-women shortlists; a further nine were chosen in open selections after the Leeds judgment.</p> <p>During the present parliament, 36 Labour MPs have announced their intention to retire. Eight constituencies are in the middle of selecting candidates. To date, only three women have actually been selected to fill vacancies, in Redcar, Sheffield Heeley and East Lothian. At the same time six female Labour MPs will retire at the next election. Unless there is a dramatic change in the remaining selections, the number of women in the parliamentary Labour party will fall at the next election regardless of how many seats Labour ends up losing.</p> <p>The failure of more women to be selected for Labour-held seats is all the more striking given that the party's rules insist on equal numbers of men and women (and two of each on every shortlist). Women candidates are being short-listed, but they are not being selected in the one member, one vote (Omov) ballots that take place in constituencies.</p> <p>Are constituencies themselves biased? Labour adopted a policy of affirmative action for women at the 1992 general election. At that time, candidates were chosen by an electoral college rather than Omov. But where a woman was nominated, there had to be at least one woman on the shortlist. The rule had little impact: a mere 12% of selections in Labour-held seats went to female candidates, the same kind of figure that is emerging in 2001.</p> <p>A disappointing comparison can also be made with the proportion of women selected for Labour-held seats before the 1987 general election. In those days, the last stand of the Bennite left, activists sitting on constituency general committees dominated selection and there was no equivalent positive discrimination towards women.

They may generate resentment against those short-listed, without ensuring, as did the all-women shortlists, that any female candidates are selected.</p> <p>But whatever the reason, the claim that the outcome of the 1997 general election marked the crossing of a Rubicon now seems hopelessly optimistic. Far from marking the removal of barriers, women candidates have found it extremely difficult to get selected for Labour-held seats. The other political parties have fared no better: the Conservatives have failed to replace a single one of their 25 retiring MPs with a female candidate. A further 14 MPs from other parties are leaving the Commons (including three women): men have been selected in all cases bar one.

      "body": "<p>Labour is gearing up to make an historic shift of resources from the wealthy south to the poorer northern regions of Britain amid growing concern among party strategists about apathy and disaffection among heartland voters.</p> <p>As Labour's Scottish conference heard repeated warnings against apathy yesterday, it also emerged that the less-favoured regions may get another vocal backbench champion, ex-cabinet minister, Peter Mandelson, now shoring up his political base at Hartlepool on Teeside.</p> <p>Downing Street last night played down a leaked memo in which Jeremy Heywood, Tony Blair's economic adviser in the cabinet secretariat, wrote of the \"tough decisions\" soon needed after the coming election - \"if we are talking about a large shift of resources from London to the north\".</p> <p>But a welter of statistics have underlined the deep divisions of wealth and poverty within Britain, among the sharpest in the industrialised world, most evident in the old north-south divide despite Mr Blair's insistence - shared by the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone - that the divisions within regions are just as bad.</p> <p>With Gordon Brown, the chancellor, using last week's budget to show growing confidence in openly-redistributive policies, the former Northern Ireland secretary also signalled his own determination to flag up regional disparities.</p> <p>After a string of weekend constituency engagements, Mr Mandelson, who has been tipped to speak out on Downing Street's behalf on such issues as Europe, added the regions to his election agenda.</p> <p>\"One of the themes of the election is spreading prosperity around the country.

      "bodyText": "Labour is gearing up to make an historic shift of resources from the wealthy south to the poorer northern regions of Britain amid growing concern among party strategists about apathy and disaffection among heartland voters. As Labour's Scottish conference heard repeated warnings against apathy yesterday, it also emerged that the less-favoured regions may get another vocal backbench champion, ex-cabinet minister, Peter Mandelson, now shoring up his political base at Hartlepool on Teeside. Downing Street last night played down a leaked memo in which Jeremy Heywood, Tony Blair's economic adviser in the cabinet secretariat, wrote of the \"tough decisions\" soon needed after the coming election - \"if we are talking about a large shift of resources from London to the north\". But a welter of statistics have underlined the deep divisions of wealth and poverty within Britain, among the sharpest in the industrialised world, most evident in the old north-south divide despite Mr Blair's insistence - shared by the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone - that the divisions within regions are just as bad. With Gordon Brown, the chancellor, using last week's budget to show growing confidence in openly-redistributive policies, the former Northern Ireland secretary also signalled his own determination to flag up regional disparities. After a string of weekend constituency engagements, Mr Mandelson, who has been tipped to speak out on Downing Street's behalf on such issues as Europe, added the regions to his election agenda. \"One of the themes of the election is spreading prosperity around the country. I would like to see this become a more prominent feature of the party's campaign in the coming election because everyone has to feel they have a stake in every region, every community ... they have to feel they have a stake in the government's successes ... there are very wide disparities.\" His intervention in the regional debate comes as Mr Heywood's leaked memo underlines that Downing Street is keen to find new ways of compensating underperforming regions. The key mechanism for switching resources from south to north lies in revising the standard spending assessment (SSA) formula under which Whitehall distributes grants to local councils. Staistics show why northern cabinet ministers John Reid, Alistair Darling and Helen Liddell - all Scots - warned against Tory and Scottish nationalist efforts to derail Labour's hopes of a second term. In Mr Blair's adopted north-east, where Mr Mandelson's seat adjoins Sedgefield, the GDP per head has dropped to 23% below the national average. Mr Mandelson can claim a track record in standing up for the region. Schools in Labour controlled Northumberland and Mr Blair's Durham receive considerably less per pupil than richer London boroughs. In a letter to him last year, Durham head teachers complained that school buildings were falling apart through lack of funds.

Lord Williams of Mostyn, the attorney general, said the Act of Settlement 1701, which bars Catholics and other non-Protestants from the line of succession, was discriminatory and should be amended. Last December, the attorney general refused to give the Guardian assurances that its editor, Alan Rusbridger, would not be prosecuted under the Treason Felony Act 1848 if the paper campaigned for repeal of the Act of Settlement and a referendum on the abolition of the monarchy. The attorney general declined to \"take action which sanctions in advance conduct which may be criminal\". The Treason Felony Act makes it a serious offence, punishable by life imprisonment, to call for an end to the monarchy, even by peaceful means. The Guardian filed a claim with the high court last month challenging the act, under the Human Rights Act, as a violation of the right to free speech. The paper plans next to challenge the Act of Settlement as a breach of another human right - that of freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, the attorney general insisted he did not want a republic, but believed the institution should be reformed. Like the Guardian, he considered the Act of Settlement discriminated against women by giving sons precedence in the line of succession and by stipulating that the monarch had to be the eldest son. Asked about removing the ban on Catholics, he replied: \"My personal view is that there should not be any such bar.\" Reform of the act would raise questions about the monarch's role as head of the Church of England. Lord Williams said he favoured a debate on the Anglican church's role as official state religion. \"I am a member of the Church in Wales, which has been disestablished since the 1920s and it works very well. It's healthy to have a debate about this in a community which now has many different faiths.\" The Act of Settlement also prohibits the sovereign from marrying a Catholic.

But it contained what may prove a crucial get-out clause for Mr Cook.</p> <p>In two of the three replies he admitted his department had acted in a limited way, \"in response to leaks by others to the press\" - specifically hostile stories in two newspapers which may have helped inform Mr Jones's own account.</p> <p>As later emerged, a version of the MPs' report had been leaked to the FO by Ernie Ross, a Labour MP who later resigned from the committee. Opposition MPs were furious and accused Mr Cook and his aides of trying to pre-empt criticism.</p> <p>\"Robin Cook is a very vain and self-important man. This committee was going to be very critical of him personally, and he hated that, so he was prepared to do anything,\" said Mr Maude.</p> <p>His attack was prompted by the verbatim account, carried in Mr Jones's new book, Control Freaks, of a telephone conversation between him and Mr Cook at 8.12am on the day the report came out.</p> <p>That was shortly after the BBC reporter's speculative predictions on the report's contents had been broadcast - minutes after embargoed copies had been issued (at 8am) but two hours before of ficial publication at 10am. Mr Jones, who has now written four books on New Labour's spin doctors, reveals that he was asked to telephone Mr Cook. Since he had not solicited the call, he felt under no obligation to accept the foreign secretary's initial insistence \"I'm talking to you off the record\", or his parting shot: \"Remember, this conversation didn't take place.\"</p> <p>In between he demanded a more \"balanced\" account of the report, including praise of his own \"unprecedented openness\". In the Mail on Sunday Mr Jones noted that Mr Cook's meticulous grasp of a detailed report 12 minutes after obtaining his official copy \"suggested remarkable powers of concentration\". In effect, his case is that Mr Cook not only read the leaked text but ac tively briefed him, contrary to his three assurances.</p> <p>The FO last night insisted that some officials, including Mr Williams, had read the Ross leak - though not Mr Cook - and that his knowledge was based on a three-page summary given to him at 8am.</p> <p>\"There was no lie, there is no breach of the ministerial code, there is no story,\" said a Foreign Office spokesman.</p>",

In a new book on the Labour media machine, Nicholas Jones, a veteran BBC political correspondent, claims that Mr Cook rang him in person to bully him into giving more favourable coverage and then lied on three occasions to parliament, denying any such activity. Though Mr Jones's own version of events appears to provide Mr Cook with an escape clause, the charges angered some opposition MPs enough to prompt the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, to write to Tony Blair. Only days after Sir Anthony Hammond cleared Peter Mandelson and Keith Vaz in the Hinduja passport affair, Mr Maude demanded an investigation into whether Mr Cook broke the ministerial code of conduct - and his dismissal if he had. The allegations, which sought to revive the 1998-99 \"cover-up\" controversy about Sandline mercenaries' covert role in Sierra Leone's running civil war, hinge on three answers Mr Cook gave to MPs, one written, one in an oral statement and the third in evidence to a select committee. In all three he insisted \"there was no briefing, no leak to the press in advance of publication\" of a critical report on the \"appalling failure\" of the FO crisis management, published on February 9 1999 by the Labour-controlled Commons foreign affairs committee. On reading the written answer to the Tory MP David Wilshire, Mr Jones writes that he felt disbelief. \"Not only had [John] Williams [Mr Cook's spokesman] been in touch with me an hour before the report was released, but Cook himself spoke to me nearly two hours before the embargo was lifted.\" Mr Jones felt that the answer was \"categorical\" and did not even try to sidestep the potential problem. But it contained what may prove a crucial get-out clause for Mr Cook. In two of the three replies he admitted his department had acted in a limited way, \"in response to leaks by others to the press\" - specifically hostile stories in two newspapers which may have helped inform Mr Jones's own account. As later emerged, a version of the MPs' report had been leaked to the FO by Ernie Ross, a Labour MP who later resigned from the committee. Opposition MPs were furious and accused Mr Cook and his aides of trying to pre-empt criticism. \"Robin Cook is a very vain and self-important man. This committee was going to be very critical of him personally, and he hated that, so he was prepared to do anything,\" said Mr Maude. His attack was prompted by the verbatim account, carried in Mr Jones's new book, Control Freaks, of a telephone conversation between him and Mr Cook at 8.12am on the day the report came out. That was shortly after the BBC reporter's speculative predictions on the report's contents had been broadcast - minutes after embargoed copies had been issued (at 8am) but two hours before of ficial publication at 10am. Mr Jones, who has now written four books on New Labour's spin doctors, reveals that he was asked to telephone Mr Cook. Since he had not solicited the call, he felt under no obligation to accept the foreign secretary's initial insistence \"I'm talking to you off the record\", or his parting shot: \"Remember, this conversation didn't take place.\" In between he demanded a more \"balanced\" account of the report, including praise of his own \"unprecedented openness\". In the Mail on Sunday Mr Jones noted that Mr Cook's meticulous grasp of a detailed report 12 minutes after obtaining his official copy \"suggested remarkable powers of concentration\". In effect, his case is that Mr Cook not only read the leaked text but ac tively briefed him, contrary to his three assurances. The FO last night insisted that some officials, including Mr Williams, had read the Ross leak - though not Mr Cook - and that his knowledge was based on a three-page summary given to him at 8am. \"There was no lie, there is no breach of the ministerial code, there is no story,\" said a Foreign Office spokesman.",

Kitchen cabinet insider, loyal to Hague now, but could one day challenge his leadership.</p> <p> Michael Howard, 57: set to step down as foreign affairs spokesman in July reshuffle, but still a powerful player. He angrily wagged his finger at Hague in shadow cabinet over Lilley's anti-Thatcherite heresies, but later conceded Tories 'made the right decision' to pick Hague, not him. Ann Widdecombe and Iain Duncan Smith take similar line.</p> <p> Michael Ancram, 53: genial Tory lawyer with common touch, despite being heir to ancient Scots earldom. Currently Tory chairman, responsible for bringing Hague pollsters bad news from voters: 'concede and move on' is his motto. Insider and Hague loyalist, ideological moderate, surrounded by core of ex-SDP officials at party HQ.</p> <p> Kenneth Clarke, 58: the man Hague defeated for the Tory leadership has said nothing in the present row. As the minister who tried to be 'tough and tender\" to NHS and schools he doesn't need to. Still hopes the party will turn to him if the crisis deepens. His uncompromising pro-Europeanism remains a major barrier, but some desperate Tory rightwingers are now wavering. </p>",

Halfway through the 1997 parliament Conservative MPs are contemplating the unthinkable, that they could do even worse next time. Key players Peter Lilley, 55: Thatcherite highbrow who salami-cut social security spending in the 1990s. Failed to make an impact as shadow chancellor, so shunted off to run the Tory policy rethink. Last week's speech tried to reassure voters on health and education, but angered free market Tories. Francis Maude, 45: shadow chancellor and clever ex-banker, usually on the right of most shadow cabinet battles. Lambasted Gordon Brown for 'going soft on spending' last July. He now promises to spend the same \u00a340bn on schools and NHS, after focus groups show voters mistrust Tories. Kitchen cabinet insider, loyal to Hague now, but could one day challenge his leadership. Michael Howard, 57: set to step down as foreign affairs spokesman in July reshuffle, but still a powerful player. He angrily wagged his finger at Hague in shadow cabinet over Lilley's anti-Thatcherite heresies, but later conceded Tories 'made the right decision' to pick Hague, not him. Ann Widdecombe and Iain Duncan Smith take similar line. Michael Ancram, 53: genial Tory lawyer with common touch, despite being heir to ancient Scots earldom. Currently Tory chairman, responsible for bringing Hague pollsters bad news from voters: 'concede and move on' is his motto. Insider and Hague loyalist, ideological moderate, surrounded by core of ex-SDP officials at party HQ. Kenneth Clarke, 58: the man Hague defeated for the Tory leadership has said nothing in the present row. As the minister who tried to be 'tough and tender\" to NHS and schools he doesn't need to. Still hopes the party will turn to him if the crisis deepens. His uncompromising pro-Europeanism remains a major barrier, but some desperate Tory rightwingers are now wavering.",

But why not restore what they have lost since Margaret Thatcher broke the earnings link in 1981? That has cost every single pensioner \u00a330 a week, and a couple \u00a345.

      "bodyText": "MPs have called for an inquiry to establish whether the national lottery has caused charities to suffer a decline in donations from the public. A report by the Commons culture, media and sport select committee says that the lottery regulator, the National Lottery Commission, should conduct a survey to establish the impact of the lottery on charities' income. The report, which looked at the operation of the lottery, says there is no clear evidence that charities have suffered - despite a widespread feeling among some charities that the lottery is causing them financial problems. In another of the report's findings, the committee backs the commission's decision to award the license for to run the lottery to Camelot because of its track record of reliability. It concludes that there is no guarantee that a not-for-profit operation would guarantee higher ticket sales - a reference to the controversy over the failed attempt by Richard Branson's not-for-profit People's Lottery to win the license from Camelot. It says: \"We believe that the primary issue is the efficient operation of the lottery to maximise the amount of money to good causes rather than whether the lottery is operated by a for-profit or not-for-profit licensee. Camelot, it says, has a \"proven record\" of running the lottery, and that \"reliability is paramount because of the implication of failure is the huge loss of revenue for the good causes\". But it does not rule out the government reconsidering a not-for-profit operator at a later date, and says it should consider the \"financial and cost implications\" of this. Committee chairman Gerald Kaufman and member Derek Wyatt said they believed that the lottery should be nationalised, but this was not an issue that was raised during the preparation of the report. The report backs the rule that lottery funding should not be used to substitute state funding of essential services in areas such as health - the so-called principle of \"additionality\" - but says this principle is \"not sacred\". Chief secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith, giving evidence to the committee earlier this year, had questioned the principle saying it was perverse to consider that some things should be excluded from lottery funding because they are \"too important\". The committee rejects Mr Smith's view, and concludes that there was a \"fundamental unpredictability\" about lottery income which does not fit comfortably with the funding of vital public services. However, it adds: \"While the additionality principle can be of use in preventing the Treasury from substituting lottery income for mainstream government spending, nevertheless we believe that at some stage the rigidity of the additionality principle should be a matter for discussion.\" The report calls for a relaxation of the rules on private lotteries, a crucial source of income for many smaller charities, especially hospices.",

      "body": "<p>A sophist, says Aristotle, is \"one who makes money from an apparent but unreal wisdom\". History does not tell us whether Dio Chrysostom, who lived and wrote some 400 years after Aristotle, composed his \"Eleventh Discourse\" as a work for hire. Nor is it known if the \"Trojan Discourse\", as it is also called, was intended as a kind of advertisement for his talents as a sophist - considerable enough to earn him the name Chrysostom (Golden-Mouth) - or as a cautionary example of the dangers of sophistry, written after its author's conversion to Stoicism. What can be seen, nearly two millennia later, is the rhetorical brilliance with which Dio, a Greek-speaking native of Asia Minor, sets out to convince his contemporaries in Ilium (Troy) that they have been duped by Homer into believing that their ancestors lost the Trojan war. </p> <p>On one view, David Irving is simply Dio Chrysostom in a three-piece suit, offering an outwardly plausible, internally consistent fiction that plays on the prejudices of his audience. At times I have heard similar arguments from Irving's critics - and from his defenders. In my own view, these dismissals underestimate both Irving and what he represents. </p> <p>If Irving were simply a \"clown\" - as one academic I know argued, complaining about the media's fascination with the trial - it would hardly have been necessary to commission a team of scholars to oppose him. Indeed, such a contest would have been grotesque. It would arguably have been similarly excessive if he were merely the harmless F\u00fchrer-fancier depicted in Selling Hitler, Robert Harris's amusing account of the \"Hitler diaries\" fiasco. </p> <p>In her book, Deborah Lipstadt argued that Holocaust denial \"is not an assault on the history of one particular group . . . it poses a threat to all who believe that knowledge and memory are among the keystones of our civilisation\". In other words, it's not just a problem for Jews. </p> <p>Like a lot of the arguments in Lipstadt's book, her conclusion is correct, but her premises are deeply flawed. The idea that Irving and his band of \"cracked anti-semites\" at the Institute for Historical Review pose some kind of threat to \"our civilisation\" or the \"western rationalist tradition\" is simply absurd. </p> <p>Yet Irving does represent a real danger. Partly this is political. The laundry list of names Hajo Funke, the expert witness who testified about Germany's far right, read out in court aren't primarily concerned with Jews. Chances are, most of the skinheads we saw marching and chanting in a video of a rally addressed by Irving in the German town of Halle have never even met a Jew. For them, Holocaust denial is just a means to an end, a verbal sign of recognition that sorts out the hard cases from the fellow travellers. Their end - Irving's project - is the rehabilitation of fascism. And given J\u00f6rg Haider's success in facing down his critics in the European Union, and Jean-Marie Le Pen's durability on the French political scene, and the rising fortunes of neo-fascists in Italy, an American must at least hesitate before assuming that fears of a far-right resurgence in Europe are purely delusional. </p> <p>But not all of Irving's defenders are fascists, or anti-semites - or even rightwingers. For every cretin who laughs at Irving's jokes about the one-man gas chamber, there are probably thousands, like John Keegan, who assume Irving is wrong about the Holocaust but wonder why that should matter to them. For every goose-stepping neo-Nazi in thrall to Irving's rhetoric, there are hundreds of readers drawn in by his narratives. </p> <p>And there will always be doubt. Despite the trial, despite the facts, despite the verdict, doubt persists. To pretend otherwise is to deceive ourselves. </p> <p>It is, after all, one thing to say, as Mr Justice Charles Gray did in his judgment, \"No objective, fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz.\" It is another thing to know that in a given building hundreds of thousands of people were murdered. How do we know anything beyond what we ourselves have experienced? How do we put our doubts to rest? </p> <p>I had nothing but sympathy for the reporter who, after listening in court to Irving's insistence that the elevator to the ovens simply couldn't have carried as many bodies as the defence expert had claimed, confessed: \"On the way home in the train that night, to my shame, I took out a pocket calculator and began to do some sums. Ten minutes for each batch of 25. I tapped in. That makes 150 an hour. Which gives 3,600 for each 24-hour period. Which gives 1,314,000 in a year. So that's fine. It could be done. Thank God, the numbers add up.\" </p> <p>Even for those of us who never thought Irving might be right, there was still doubt. Not about the facts, but about what would happen if the facts somehow made no difference. </p> <p>What pulled me back was a memory: I am six years old and my father has brought his best friend home for dinner. After we eat, the friend takes the back off our television set and shows me the tubes lighting up inside. One is burned out, and as he replaces it I notice a line of numbers on his arm, just below the wrist. \"What are those, uncle Mike?\" He tells me that the Germans put them there when he was a little boy \"so I wouldn't get lost\". </p> <p>My uncle Mike was never a little boy. When he was 12 or 13, the Germans occupied Hungary, and his entire family was put on a train to Auschwitz. Big for his age, and claiming to be older, he was sent to work in the mines. This was 1944, and Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. By then the rest of his family had been gassed. </p> <p>The truth is, I can't be certain of all these details, and my uncle Mike has been dead for some time. I was reminded of him while listening to Irving's response to the obvious questions: what happened to the missing Jews? If they didn't die in the camps, where were they? Irving talks about \"the large number that turned up in the state of Palestine, what's now the state of Israel\", and sometimes, as if acknowledging that this number isn't nearly large enough, claims that others might have been killed in Dresden. The rest, he suggests, fled to the Soviet Union or the United States. As a simple matter of accounting, this is preposterous. As an explanation, it is also monstrous. Because the assumption behind it is that, lured by the good life to the United States, or chasing the workers' paradise in Russia, or seeking the Zionist dream in Israel, people like my Uncle Mike would simply forget that they had once had mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, grandparents, children, and wouldn't bother to look for them, which is why so many Jews are still unaccounted for. In other words, it presumes that Jews are not human beings. </p> <p>When I arrived at the home of the Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg in Vermont a few months before the trial, we began by talking about numbers. In The Destruction of the European Jews, Hilberg lists one million Jews killed at Auschwitz. His total number for the Holocaust, however, is 5.1m, not 6m, a conclusion that led Irving to cite his work at the trial, and which has caused Hilberg no end of trouble. Does it really matter? I asked. </p> <p> 'Yes, it matters,\" Hilberg said. \"It matters on a variety of counts. When you segment these losses by country, you find that the major difference between my count and those who say six million . . . is the Soviet Union. Which means, if they didn't die they're there . . . That matters - because you are talking about a substantial part of Jewish history. And you're talking about current Jewish history!\" I asked about gas chambers. Irving devotes so much energy to creating doubt about gas chambers. Why? \"People are shot or hacked to death in other countries, even after world war two - Rwanda, for example. You built the gas chamber with a view to killing a mass of people. Once you have a gas chamber, you have a vision, and the vision is total annihilation. In a gas chamber, you don't see the victim. So the gas chamber in that sense is more dangerous, the gas chamber is more criminal. The gas chamber has wider implications. So when you deny the gas chamber, you deny not just a part of the event, you deny one of the defining concepts. And of course you deny, apart from anything else, the death of several million people.\" </p> <p>Whatever we talked about, we seemed always to come back to numbers. \"These numbers do matter,\" Hilberg said. \"They also matter for the very simple reason - call it religious if you like.\" At this point he saw my gaze shift from the Teletubbies magnets on his refrigerator to the menorah balanced on top of his television set. </p> <p>\"I'm an atheist,\" he said. \"All these things belong to my wife, not me. I am an atheist. But there is ultimately, if you don't want to surrender to nihilism entirely, the matter of a record. Does the record matter? In my judgment it is not discussable, it is not arguable. It matters because it matters to me - it's my life.\" </p> <p>The sanctity of facts. As the trial wore on, I often found my mind returning to the afternoon I'd spent with Hilberg. After a lifetime of studying brutality, inhumanity, murder on an industrial scale, after personal tragedy and professional conflict, this is what he has to hold on to: the sanctity of facts. Was that enough? </p> <p>Charles Gray's reasoned judgment ratified every major proposition the defence sought to establish. Irving had indeed been shown to be a liar, a bigot, and a distorter of historical evidence - a man whose word could no longer be relied upon for the smallest detail, let alone a reliable interpreter of major historical events. It had also established, if only by implication, the right of Jews and other maligned ethnic groups to respond robustly, and in an organised manner, when they are attacked. Indeed it affirmed their right to do so even when the attacks are \"merely\" verbal - so long as the response is also limited to speech. And, despite considerable reluctance, the judge also issued a number of findings on the destruction of the European Jews, holding that, solely on the basis of the evidence available to Irving - not the totality of the evidence - the \"historical data\" were clear enough to compel the conclusion that the Holocaust had indeed happened, that Hitler had at the very least been aware of what happened, and that only a prejudicial cast of mind could account for the refusal to acknowledge the reality of the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Insofar as it was attainable under the laws of libel, justice had been done. Was that enough? </p> <p>Irving's ability to disturb Jews has been diminished, and will probably be curtailed further as he is forced either to pay his opponents' costs or submit his finances to the bankruptcy court. His fellow \"revisionists\", too, will now have to do without Irving as their respectable frontman. But it is doubtful the judge's arguments will themselves make any impact on the paranoid adherents of Holocaust denial or other believers in Jewish conspiracy. Their views are, by their very nature, impervious to reasoned judgment. </p> <p>Within months of his loss, Irving was already being received in the US as a martyr to their cause. Nor does it seem likely that even this triumph will encourage Irving's opponents to relax their eternal vigilance. Lipstadt's backers among Jewish organisations have their own reasons for making sure the struggle continues. And though she and her publishers deserved to win, the encouragement their victory will give to groups such as the Anti-Defamation League or the Board of Deputies in their efforts to police public discussion, not just of the Holocaust but of American and Israeli policies, is no cause for celebration. </p> <p>But there was something else that troubled me. There was something, I realised, that struck me as missing all along: witnesses. I understood perfectly why Lipstadt's lawyers had decided that calling witnesses would be a distraction. They had a case to win. Besides, they quite rightly sought to avoid giving Irving a chance to vent his hostility on people who, by definition, had already suffered more than enough. </p> <p>But Irving's whole approach to history was based on the premise that witness testimony is essentially worthless. Sure, he used it when it suited him - and, as the defence proved, ignored it when it didn't. But on the larger question of whether we can really understand the Holocaust - or any historical catastrophe - without witnesses, the lawyers and the judge mostly went along with Irving's premise. </p> <p>As a reporter, I know perfectly well that witnesses can mislead - not always innocently. But without them - or our own eyewitness testimony - there would be nothing to report. Even if there were sound reasons for not calling living witnesses, there might have been a place found in court for the voice of Salmen Gradowski, a member of the Sonderkommando at Auschwitz who was killed in the fall of 1944. Knowing that his own death was imminent, Gradowski took the notes he had managed to make during the previous 19 months and put them inside a metal canister, which he buried in a pit of human ash. Found after the war, Gradowski's journal asks: \"Dear discoverer of these writings! I have a request of you: this is the real reason I write, that my doomed life may attain some meaning, that my hellish days and hopeless tomorrows may find a purpose in the future.\" </p> <p>Facts are crucial. Facts are sacred. Facts are indeed what give history its dignity. But they are not the whole story. The struggle to find the right way to describe the destruction of European Jewry is sometimes depicted as a contest between history and memory. And as we have now all been taught, memory is a terribly unreliable guide to wie es eigentlich gewesen ist , \"how it really was\". </p> <p>And so we take refuge in history, in documents, in facts - cool, detached, silent, precise. </p> <p>Thanks to Deborah Lipstadt and her lawyers, the facts about the Holocaust are indeed safer - and for that, perhaps, we should be grateful. </p> <p>But witnesses, memories, testimony - all that was left outside the courtroom. And that seems to me cause for regret. </p> <p>Witnesses are always partial. Memory is by definition selective. And testimony - not the sworn responses of expert witnesses, but the still-vivid responses of people whose history is lived, not studied - can be treacherous. </p> <p>Yet without witnesses, without human voices to put flesh on the facts, we have something that, while it may pass muster as history, can never tell the truth. </p> <p> \u0095 \u00a9 Don Guttenplan 2001.

In her book, Deborah Lipstadt argued that Holocaust denial \"is not an assault on the history of one particular group . . . it poses a threat to all who believe that knowledge and memory are among the keystones of our civilisation\". In other words, it's not just a problem for Jews. Like a lot of the arguments in Lipstadt's book, her conclusion is correct, but her premises are deeply flawed. The idea that Irving and his band of \"cracked anti-semites\" at the Institute for Historical Review pose some kind of threat to \"our civilisation\" or the \"western rationalist tradition\" is simply absurd. Yet Irving does represent a real danger. Partly this is political. The laundry list of names Hajo Funke, the expert witness who testified about Germany's far right, read out in court aren't primarily concerned with Jews. Chances are, most of the skinheads we saw marching and chanting in a video of a rally addressed by Irving in the German town of Halle have never even met a Jew. For them, Holocaust denial is just a means to an end, a verbal sign of recognition that sorts out the hard cases from the fellow travellers. Their end - Irving's project - is the rehabilitation of fascism. And given J\u00f6rg Haider's success in facing down his critics in the European Union, and Jean-Marie Le Pen's durability on the French political scene, and the rising fortunes of neo-fascists in Italy, an American must at least hesitate before assuming that fears of a far-right resurgence in Europe are purely delusional. But not all of Irving's defenders are fascists, or anti-semites - or even rightwingers. For every cretin who laughs at Irving's jokes about the one-man gas chamber, there are probably thousands, like John Keegan, who assume Irving is wrong about the Holocaust but wonder why that should matter to them. For every goose-stepping neo-Nazi in thrall to Irving's rhetoric, there are hundreds of readers drawn in by his narratives. And there will always be doubt. Despite the trial, despite the facts, despite the verdict, doubt persists. To pretend otherwise is to deceive ourselves. It is, after all, one thing to say, as Mr Justice Charles Gray did in his judgment, \"No objective, fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz.\" It is another thing to know that in a given building hundreds of thousands of people were murdered. How do we know anything beyond what we ourselves have experienced? How do we put our doubts to rest? I had nothing but sympathy for the reporter who, after listening in court to Irving's insistence that the elevator to the ovens simply couldn't have carried as many bodies as the defence expert had claimed, confessed: \"On the way home in the train that night, to my shame, I took out a pocket calculator and began to do some sums. Ten minutes for each batch of 25. I tapped in. That makes 150 an hour. Which gives 3,600 for each 24-hour period. Which gives 1,314,000 in a year. So that's fine. It could be done. Thank God, the numbers add up.\" Even for those of us who never thought Irving might be right, there was still doubt. Not about the facts, but about what would happen if the facts somehow made no difference. What pulled me back was a memory: I am six years old and my father has brought his best friend home for dinner. After we eat, the friend takes the back off our television set and shows me the tubes lighting up inside. One is burned out, and as he replaces it I notice a line of numbers on his arm, just below the wrist. \"What are those, uncle Mike?\" He tells me that the Germans put them there when he was a little boy \"so I wouldn't get lost\". My uncle Mike was never a little boy. When he was 12 or 13, the Germans occupied Hungary, and his entire family was put on a train to Auschwitz. Big for his age, and claiming to be older, he was sent to work in the mines. This was 1944, and Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. By then the rest of his family had been gassed. The truth is, I can't be certain of all these details, and my uncle Mike has been dead for some time. I was reminded of him while listening to Irving's response to the obvious questions: what happened to the missing Jews? If they didn't die in the camps, where were they? Irving talks about \"the large number that turned up in the state of Palestine, what's now the state of Israel\", and sometimes, as if acknowledging that this number isn't nearly large enough, claims that others might have been killed in Dresden. The rest, he suggests, fled to the Soviet Union or the United States. As a simple matter of accounting, this is preposterous. As an explanation, it is also monstrous. Because the assumption behind it is that, lured by the good life to the United States, or chasing the workers' paradise in Russia, or seeking the Zionist dream in Israel, people like my Uncle Mike would simply forget that they had once had mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, grandparents, children, and wouldn't bother to look for them, which is why so many Jews are still unaccounted for. In other words, it presumes that Jews are not human beings. When I arrived at the home of the Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg in Vermont a few months before the trial, we began by talking about numbers. In The Destruction of the European Jews, Hilberg lists one million Jews killed at Auschwitz. His total number for the Holocaust, however, is 5.1m, not 6m, a conclusion that led Irving to cite his work at the trial, and which has caused Hilberg no end of trouble. Does it really matter? I asked. 'Yes, it matters,\" Hilberg said. \"It matters on a variety of counts. When you segment these losses by country, you find that the major difference between my count and those who say six million . . . is the Soviet Union. Which means, if they didn't die they're there . . . That matters - because you are talking about a substantial part of Jewish history. And you're talking about current Jewish history!\" I asked about gas chambers. Irving devotes so much energy to creating doubt about gas chambers. Why? \"People are shot or hacked to death in other countries, even after world war two - Rwanda, for example. You built the gas chamber with a view to killing a mass of people. Once you have a gas chamber, you have a vision, and the vision is total annihilation. In a gas chamber, you don't see the victim. So the gas chamber in that sense is more dangerous, the gas chamber is more criminal. The gas chamber has wider implications. So when you deny the gas chamber, you deny not just a part of the event, you deny one of the defining concepts. And of course you deny, apart from anything else, the death of several million people.\" Whatever we talked about, we seemed always to come back to numbers. \"These numbers do matter,\" Hilberg said. \"They also matter for the very simple reason - call it religious if you like.\" At this point he saw my gaze shift from the Teletubbies magnets on his refrigerator to the menorah balanced on top of his television set. \"I'm an atheist,\" he said. \"All these things belong to my wife, not me. I am an atheist. But there is ultimately, if you don't want to surrender to nihilism entirely, the matter of a record. Does the record matter? In my judgment it is not discussable, it is not arguable. It matters because it matters to me - it's my life.\" The sanctity of facts. As the trial wore on, I often found my mind returning to the afternoon I'd spent with Hilberg. After a lifetime of studying brutality, inhumanity, murder on an industrial scale, after personal tragedy and professional conflict, this is what he has to hold on to: the sanctity of facts. Was that enough? Charles Gray's reasoned judgment ratified every major proposition the defence sought to establish. Irving had indeed been shown to be a liar, a bigot, and a distorter of historical evidence - a man whose word could no longer be relied upon for the smallest detail, let alone a reliable interpreter of major historical events. It had also established, if only by implication, the right of Jews and other maligned ethnic groups to respond robustly, and in an organised manner, when they are attacked. Indeed it affirmed their right to do so even when the attacks are \"merely\" verbal - so long as the response is also limited to speech. And, despite considerable reluctance, the judge also issued a number of findings on the destruction of the European Jews, holding that, solely on the basis of the evidence available to Irving - not the totality of the evidence - the \"historical data\" were clear enough to compel the conclusion that the Holocaust had indeed happened, that Hitler had at the very least been aware of what happened, and that only a prejudicial cast of mind could account for the refusal to acknowledge the reality of the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Insofar as it was attainable under the laws of libel, justice had been done. Was that enough? Irving's ability to disturb Jews has been diminished, and will probably be curtailed further as he is forced either to pay his opponents' costs or submit his finances to the bankruptcy court. His fellow \"revisionists\", too, will now have to do without Irving as their respectable frontman. But it is doubtful the judge's arguments will themselves make any impact on the paranoid adherents of Holocaust denial or other believers in Jewish conspiracy. Their views are, by their very nature, impervious to reasoned judgment. Within months of his loss, Irving was already being received in the US as a martyr to their cause. Nor does it seem likely that even this triumph will encourage Irving's opponents to relax their eternal vigilance. Lipstadt's backers among Jewish organisations have their own reasons for making sure the struggle continues. And though she and her publishers deserved to win, the encouragement their victory will give to groups such as the Anti-Defamation League or the Board of Deputies in their efforts to police public discussion, not just of the Holocaust but of American and Israeli policies, is no cause for celebration. But there was something else that troubled me. There was something, I realised, that struck me as missing all along: witnesses. I understood perfectly why Lipstadt's lawyers had decided that calling witnesses would be a distraction. They had a case to win. Besides, they quite rightly sought to avoid giving Irving a chance to vent his hostility on people who, by definition, had already suffered more than enough. But Irving's whole approach to history was based on the premise that witness testimony is essentially worthless. Sure, he used it when it suited him - and, as the defence proved, ignored it when it didn't. But on the larger question of whether we can really understand the Holocaust - or any historical catastrophe - without witnesses, the lawyers and the judge mostly went along with Irving's premise. As a reporter, I know perfectly well that witnesses can mislead - not always innocently. But without them - or our own eyewitness testimony - there would be nothing to report. Even if there were sound reasons for not calling living witnesses, there might have been a place found in court for the voice of Salmen Gradowski, a member of the Sonderkommando at Auschwitz who was killed in the fall of 1944. Knowing that his own death was imminent, Gradowski took the notes he had managed to make during the previous 19 months and put them inside a metal canister, which he buried in a pit of human ash. Found after the war, Gradowski's journal asks: \"Dear discoverer of these writings! I have a request of you: this is the real reason I write, that my doomed life may attain some meaning, that my hellish days and hopeless tomorrows may find a purpose in the future.\" Facts are crucial. Facts are sacred. Facts are indeed what give history its dignity. But they are not the whole story. The struggle to find the right way to describe the destruction of European Jewry is sometimes depicted as a contest between history and memory. And as we have now all been taught, memory is a terribly unreliable guide to wie es eigentlich gewesen ist , \"how it really was\". And so we take refuge in history, in documents, in facts - cool, detached, silent, precise. Thanks to Deborah Lipstadt and her lawyers, the facts about the Holocaust are indeed safer - and for that, perhaps, we should be grateful. But witnesses, memories, testimony - all that was left outside the courtroom. And that seems to me cause for regret. Witnesses are always partial. Memory is by definition selective. And testimony - not the sworn responses of expert witnesses, but the still-vivid responses of people whose history is lived, not studied - can be treacherous. Yet without witnesses, without human voices to put flesh on the facts, we have something that, while it may pass muster as history, can never tell the truth. \u0095 \u00a9 Don Guttenplan 2001.

Mr Simic voluntarily boarded a plane in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and flew to the Netherlands, where he was immediately placed in custody, a tribunal spokesman said. The suspect, who is likely to make his first appearance in court later this week, is the first Yugoslav citizen to turn himself in to the international court. He said he was confident he would prove his innocence. His surrender comes as the United States has stepped up pressure on Yugoslavia to cooperate with the tribunal or face a severing of aid. Mr Simic, a trained doctor, was the municipal leader of the town of Bosanski Samac, which was overrun by Serb forces in April 1992. Of the 17,000 Croats and Muslims, about half the town's population, fewer than 300 were left at the end of the war in 1995. Control of the town was crucial for the Serb effort to build a corridor between Serbia and the Serbs in the Krajina district of Croatia and western Bosnia. Non-Serbs, especially professionals and civic leaders, were rounded up and herded into camps run by Serb police. Many were killed, tortured or sexually assaulted. The rest of the non-Serbs fled or were transferred to other villages, where they were forced into slave labour. Mr Simic remained the civilian head of the local government throughout the campaign of atrocities, and led the \"Serb Crisis Staff\", who directed the \"ethnic cleansing\" of the town, the tribunal said.

He will take up his position as a non-executive director of the station in April for a period of three years.

      "bodyText": "1. Celebrity Big Brother, the star-packed successor to the slice-of-life international TV hit is under way on Channel 4. 2. The new manifestation of the show aims to raise money for Comic Relief and features six British celebrities who are scrapping it out over a week to be the last survivor by this Friday's Red Nose Day. 3. Boxer Chris Eubank, Brookside actress Claire Sweeney, Boyzone star Keith Duffy, comedian Jack Dee, and TV presenters Anthea Turner and Vanessa Feltz entered the house last Friday to live under the gaze of its 24 cameras. 4. The first evictee has already been chosen with Chris Eubank being given his marching orders in the viewers' poll on Saturday night, attracting more than 750,000 votes, with each telephone call raising 15.5p for the charity. 5. Anthea Turner was nominated alongside Eubank (the contestants secretly nominate each other and the two with the most nominations face a public poll) but escaped, with some help from her husband Grant Bovey, who has admitted running up a huge phone bill to help keep her in. 6. Eubank dished the dirt on Anthea afterwards, claiming she was \"fragile\" and upset by her negative public image. This was increased by mocking tabloid coverage of her wedding, which featured a tie-up deal with a glossy magazine and a chocolate manufacturer. 7. Meanwhile, Jack Dee has indicated he is less than enthralled at living in the UK's least private house and on Sunday tested out the night-vision cameras. As Sweeney and Duffy relaxed in the infamous hot tub, Dee was in the garden secretly digging a hole under a fence. He then spied an open gate but was quickly captured by security guards and frog-marched back. 8. Commentators have pointed out that the celebrities have been afforded more privacy in the reality TV show than their predecessors, and are living without the intrusion of 24-hour web cam coverage; instead, there are edited video clips available to internet viewers. 9. The nation was enthralled last year as 10 strangers, who started out as unknowns, lived together in the Big Brother house for nine weeks with one being evicted every week in an attempt to win the \u00a370,000 prize money. 10. Craig Phillips won the cash and donated it to a young friend for vital surgery, but only after a blistering confrontation with 'Nasty' Nick Bateman, who had taken a very Machiavellian approach to winning at all costs.",

      "body": "<p>I cannot remember a week-end like it. If you were all tooled up with the right equipment, you could watch four Test matches live on TV - England v Sri Lanka and West Indies v South Africa on Sky, and India v Australia, and New Zealand v Pakistan on Asian subscription channels - as well as two FA Cup and two rugby league quarter-finals. But somehow none of it quite measured up to Chris Eubank in the Celebrity Big Brother house. </p> <p>Those of us who still cherish Chris's memorable meeting with Mrs Merton, or the moment on Sky when he introduced \"oral theckth\" into a discussion of Mike Tyson's prospects, will seize any opportunity to witness him talking cobblerth in a quasi-live context, and here we had it in Spades. I am aware that Celebrity Big Brother is for charidee, and that any fun I poke at it will mark me down as a major league misery guts unconcerned about world poverty, who probably enjoys nothing better than pulling the wings off butterflies while leafing through recipes for cooking live baby, but that is something I am just going to have to live with. My email address appears at the foot of this article. </p> <p>I mean, come on. I ask you. Comic Relief or no Comic Relief, Vanessa Feltz, Anthea Turner, Chris Eubank, Jack Dee, an actress from Brookside, and one of the least interesting members of Boyzone in a week-long popularity contest (Christopher Biggins, I assume, was unavailable)? This was not so much being trapped in a house, as trapped in a bad edition of Celebrity Squares. </p> <p>One of the things that made the original Big Brother interesting was the thought that the participants, needing the cash prize, might behave disreputably. Here, the \"celebrities\" manifestly do not need the money, which goes to charity anyway, so the game show element of the programme is effectively removed; while, since these \"celebrities\" scarcely exist outside of television studios, there is little potential in seeing the cameras capturing them unawares. As if that were ever going to happen. </p> <p>What happens instead is an elaborate game of double bluff in which the celebs appear to be behaving in ways they would not wish the camera to record, while clearly being aware the cameras are constantly turning. Why would they not be? </p> <p>So you had episodes like Vanessa Feltz discussing female masturbation with Keith out of Boyzone (who says light entertainment is dead?), proving what a fun up-front girl she is, without a thought of how she might be ruining the evening for me and the good lady wife, what with the recurrence of unwanted visual images and that; or Anthea Turner making a bid for the Domestic Goddess vote by demonstrating how to stuff a duvet into its cover. </p> <p>Call me an old cynic, but I could not help noting how these two contestants have been given a fairly rough ride by the press of late, and will have done their future career prospects no harm at all by appearing to do something for charity; while whatsisname from Boyzone and thingy from Brookside will have raised their profile considerably. But isn't that what charidee is all about? </p> <p>Jack Dee I exempt from these criticisms because he is funny, and appeared to have wandered into the programme by mistake, while Eubank also escapes because he is clearly absolutely sincere in his view that he is the most famous and important person in Britain. </p> <p>When Anthea asked him how he felt about going into the Big Brother house, he did a little bit of business with his walking stick, before seeming to embark on something akin to his address to the nation. \"Unthettled,\" he said, before adding for the benefit of the little people, \"It'th a thtate of mind.\" Thanks Chris. </p> <p>My view on Comic Relief is that what comedy is all about is subversion. Comedians should not be seen to be participating in society. They need to puncture its pomposities, taking the mickey out of things like, well like Comic Relief. They could start by pointing out that if we cannot show compassion for those less fortunate than ourselves without some well-known newsreader putting on a red nose and sitting in a bath of baked beans, it is a pretty poor do. </p> <p>There was subversion of sorts on Jumpers For Goalposts, Sky's new comedy quiz featuring characters from The Fast Show, including my colleague Ron Manager. </p> <p>The show shamelessly pilfered ideas from other quizzes, like a Guess The Sportsman game nicked directly from A Question Of Sport; except you could not imagine Sue Barker back announcing a film of a motor-cycling footballer with, \"David Batty, there, with both hands clasped firmly round his helmet.\" </p> <p>I will return to Jumpers For Goalposts, which is very funny indeed, but for the moment I am unable to move beyond the thought of Vanessa and the lad from Boyzone. As Ron Manager might say: mmm, enduring image, isn't it? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin@kelner.demon.co.uk\">martin@kelner.demon.co.uk</a></p>",

Those of us who still cherish Chris's memorable meeting with Mrs Merton, or the moment on Sky when he introduced \"oral theckth\" into a discussion of Mike Tyson's prospects, will seize any opportunity to witness him talking cobblerth in a quasi-live context, and here we had it in Spades. I am aware that Celebrity Big Brother is for charidee, and that any fun I poke at it will mark me down as a major league misery guts unconcerned about world poverty, who probably enjoys nothing better than pulling the wings off butterflies while leafing through recipes for cooking live baby, but that is something I am just going to have to live with. My email address appears at the foot of this article. I mean, come on. I ask you. Comic Relief or no Comic Relief, Vanessa Feltz, Anthea Turner, Chris Eubank, Jack Dee, an actress from Brookside, and one of the least interesting members of Boyzone in a week-long popularity contest (Christopher Biggins, I assume, was unavailable)? This was not so much being trapped in a house, as trapped in a bad edition of Celebrity Squares. One of the things that made the original Big Brother interesting was the thought that the participants, needing the cash prize, might behave disreputably. Here, the \"celebrities\" manifestly do not need the money, which goes to charity anyway, so the game show element of the programme is effectively removed; while, since these \"celebrities\" scarcely exist outside of television studios, there is little potential in seeing the cameras capturing them unawares. As if that were ever going to happen. What happens instead is an elaborate game of double bluff in which the celebs appear to be behaving in ways they would not wish the camera to record, while clearly being aware the cameras are constantly turning. Why would they not be? So you had episodes like Vanessa Feltz discussing female masturbation with Keith out of Boyzone (who says light entertainment is dead?), proving what a fun up-front girl she is, without a thought of how she might be ruining the evening for me and the good lady wife, what with the recurrence of unwanted visual images and that; or Anthea Turner making a bid for the Domestic Goddess vote by demonstrating how to stuff a duvet into its cover. Call me an old cynic, but I could not help noting how these two contestants have been given a fairly rough ride by the press of late, and will have done their future career prospects no harm at all by appearing to do something for charity; while whatsisname from Boyzone and thingy from Brookside will have raised their profile considerably. But isn't that what charidee is all about? Jack Dee I exempt from these criticisms because he is funny, and appeared to have wandered into the programme by mistake, while Eubank also escapes because he is clearly absolutely sincere in his view that he is the most famous and important person in Britain. When Anthea asked him how he felt about going into the Big Brother house, he did a little bit of business with his walking stick, before seeming to embark on something akin to his address to the nation. \"Unthettled,\" he said, before adding for the benefit of the little people, \"It'th a thtate of mind.\" Thanks Chris. My view on Comic Relief is that what comedy is all about is subversion. Comedians should not be seen to be participating in society. They need to puncture its pomposities, taking the mickey out of things like, well like Comic Relief. They could start by pointing out that if we cannot show compassion for those less fortunate than ourselves without some well-known newsreader putting on a red nose and sitting in a bath of baked beans, it is a pretty poor do. There was subversion of sorts on Jumpers For Goalposts, Sky's new comedy quiz featuring characters from The Fast Show, including my colleague Ron Manager. The show shamelessly pilfered ideas from other quizzes, like a Guess The Sportsman game nicked directly from A Question Of Sport; except you could not imagine Sue Barker back announcing a film of a motor-cycling footballer with, \"David Batty, there, with both hands clasped firmly round his helmet.\" I will return to Jumpers For Goalposts, which is very funny indeed, but for the moment I am unable to move beyond the thought of Vanessa and the lad from Boyzone. As Ron Manager might say: mmm, enduring image, isn't it? martin@kelner.demon.co.uk",

He said the \"bulk of cases\" were still known to have been spread by movements through Longtown market in Cumbria and by a sheep dealer in Devon.</p> <p>Mr Scudamore said: \"Most of these cases are linked together either by the movement of sheep or by local spread because of the movement of people, equipment or animals. The majority of the outbreaks remain in counties where the problem exists. \"The problem is localised to a large extent where the sheep movements took place from Longtown market.</p> <p>\"That is the major problem and also in Devon, where it spread from the dealer who bought sheep in Northumberland,\" he said. However, Mr Scudamore's comments are unlikely to calm farmers' fears that nowhere is free from the threat of disease after the disease took hold in two new counties. Over the weekend, farmers voiced fears that the disease could spread on the wind, potentially affecting every farm in Britain.</p> <p>A record daily total of 25 more outbreaks were confirmed yesterday by the Ministry of Agriculture. They include cases in Gloucestershire, in the Forest of Dean, and a farm in Kent, both of which were previously unaffected.</p> <p>And four new suspected cases of foot and mouth were today being investigated in Lancashire, a regional Maff spokeswoman said.

      "bodyText": "As the number of confirmed cases of foot and mouth disease rose to 181 today, the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, warned that farmers must be prepared for further outbreaks before the disease is contained and eliminated. He defended the government's handling of the crisis, saying the new cases did not mean the disease is raging out of control. \"The disease was already incubating, particularly in Cumbria and Devon, and to that extent we do have it under control,\" he said. The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said the \"major problem\" was still characterised by a handful of regions which had been most affected by the virus. He said the \"bulk of cases\" were still known to have been spread by movements through Longtown market in Cumbria and by a sheep dealer in Devon. Mr Scudamore said: \"Most of these cases are linked together either by the movement of sheep or by local spread because of the movement of people, equipment or animals. The majority of the outbreaks remain in counties where the problem exists. \"The problem is localised to a large extent where the sheep movements took place from Longtown market. \"That is the major problem and also in Devon, where it spread from the dealer who bought sheep in Northumberland,\" he said. However, Mr Scudamore's comments are unlikely to calm farmers' fears that nowhere is free from the threat of disease after the disease took hold in two new counties. Over the weekend, farmers voiced fears that the disease could spread on the wind, potentially affecting every farm in Britain. A record daily total of 25 more outbreaks were confirmed yesterday by the Ministry of Agriculture. They include cases in Gloucestershire, in the Forest of Dean, and a farm in Kent, both of which were previously unaffected. And four new suspected cases of foot and mouth were today being investigated in Lancashire, a regional Maff spokeswoman said. Two farms in the Withnell area and two in the Halton area of the county are suspected of having the disease. At the moment there are three confirmed cases in Lancashire and five \"dangerous contact\" cases. A total of 155,000 animals have now been earmarked for slaughter, of which 116,000 have already been culled. Since the crisis began almost three weeks ago, 935 premises have been placed under restrictions, of which just under half still remain in place.

Here is the biggest, oddest greenhouse ever - a mass of steel-framed bubbles moulded into the hollow of a former china-clay pit. </p> <p>The intersecting \"biomes\" (domes sheltering plant life and ecosystems from around the globe) stretch for 858m near the Cornish town of St Austell. The biggest is 200m long, 100m wide and 65m high. The domes are so light that the air inside weighs almost as much as their tubular steel and fluoropolymer structure. In fact, the Humid Tropics biome actually weighs less than the air it encloses. It is more like an airship than a conventional building, but then almost everything about this \u00a374m millennium project is remarkable. </p> <p>As a practical project, Eden dates back to 1996. Tim Smit, a former rock-band producer and ubergardener, set out to create the \"world in a day\" in a sequence of dramatic greenhouses sited not far from Cornwall's beach resorts. This brilliantly engineered Garden of Eden is already proving as exciting as Burton and Turner's Palm House at Kew (1848) and Paxton's Crystal Palace at Hyde Park (1851) were in their prime. Even before Smit's bizarre bubbles are ready for the public, visitors have flocked to see them billowing out of the deep incision in the land. The design may be theatrical but it does have to attract a large audience (attendance figures of half a million in the first year, rising to 750,000, are anticipated), who will come to learn about how we can protect and care for the biosphere that we do so much to destroy. So it will be both a \"visitor attraction\" and a place of learning, along the lines of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew and its outposts, notably the Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst Place in West Sussex. </p> <p>How radical is the architecture? The basic structure is not altogether new. Each biome is made up of galvanised, straight sections of tubular steel, raised up and bolted together like giant Meccano to form no fewer than 625 hexagons, 16 pentagons and 190 triangles. The \"geodesic\" domes that these shapes form were perfected in the 1930s and 1940s by American inventor Buckminster Fuller - a major influence on Nicholas Grimshaw, architect of the Eden Project, and many other architects in thrall to sophisticated modern engineering. </p> <p>What is new is the way in which the hollow frame of each dome has been filled with translucent, triple-layered ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) pillows. Grimshaw has used the same device in the tower of the National Space Centre in Leicester, which opens at the end of June, and ETFE is likely to be used to an increasing extent in new buildings. It is very light (one-hundredth the weight of glass), recyclable, easy to replace and more flexible and less dangerous to work with than glass. (At St Austell it was installed by abseilers - known locally as \"sky monkeys\".) Grimshaw believes the ETFE pillows may be replaced by some as yet undeveloped \"breathing\" skin when they come to the end of their 25-year lifespan. </p> <p>The result is a structure that looks like something from a sci-fi movie. But this was the easy part. It was far more difficult to fit the bubbles into the former quarry - a deep, uneven, unstable site that was prone to flooding. It was devoid of soil, too, which isn't much help when you want to plant trees and grow plants. </p> <p>So Smit's team, which, in addition to Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, included Anthony Hunt Associates (engineers), Ove Arup and Partners (environmental engineers), McAlpine (contractors) and Land Use Consultants (landscape design), pulled off a kind of conjuring trick. In order to make a building site for the greenhouses, they sliced 13m off the top of the uneven quarry walls and hurled this down to the bottom of the 60m-deep pit, thus raising the quarry floor and giving it a natural topsoil. This required the shifting of 1.8m tonnes of earth, which took six months, or, as Smit likes to put it, the equivalent labour of 8m workers toiling for a day with shovels and wheelbarrows. The stuff of pyramid-building. </p> <p>But then it rained almost continually for two months, and the quarry filled up with more than 160m litres of water. It might have been time to give up, but Ove Arup worked out a way of pumping the water out of the quarry. Then the engineers drove 2,000 rock anchors into the walls to prevent landslides and sprayed them with what they describe as a \"soup\" of seeds and plant food, so new roots could knit anchors and quarry walls together. The walls are now vertical fields enfolding the biomes. </p> <p>The final design has evolved greatly from its original, which looked more like Grimshaw's Waterloo International Terminal. The sinuous roof of this characterful building caught the eye of the Eden team, but the uneven terrain of the St Austell site was unsuitable for such a wide-spanned arched structure. Even then, it took computer-aided modelling and manufacture to construct the frame of the biomes: each component is, in effect, a one-off. </p> <p>The end result is an intriguing building that has an organic feel entirely appropriate to its function. The biomes appear to be growing from the old pit, and their hexagons and pentagons echo those seen in the structures of plants and insects. Rarely has building technology been so close to nature's blueprints. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Eden Project opens on Saturday.

Their younger daughter, Ruth, lived in Enfield. \"I am very sorry. I have come to tell you that your daughter, Ruth, is dead. She has been found in suspicious circumstances.\"</p> <p>\"There is no easy way to convey that sort of information,\" Moreland says now. \"I was just stunned.

An Ordinary Murder is published this month. It is no ordinary book.</p> <p>Five years ago, I was at a seminar on crime and media organised by the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. I was there as the Guardian's crime correspondent to discuss media coverage of crime, but by far the most interesting contribution of the evening came not from the platform but from a woman in the audience - Lesley Moreland.</p> <p>Her daughter, she said, had been murdered. The murderer was not a stranger but someone who had been introduced to Ruth by her ex-boyfriend. He had a history of violence towards women. After a day of drinking and taking drugs (including LSD), he had gone to her house and stabbed her to death.</p> <p>The first point Moreland wanted to make was \"the way victims of violent crime are portrayed in the media as people whose lives have fallen apart and will have no further meaning\". She elaborates on this in her book: \"While this may be their initial reaction, it is not the full reality in the longer term. This image provides no alternative role models for future victims of violent crime.\"</p> <p>One of the most overused clich\u00e9s in crime reporting is the expression \"coming to terms with\". Exactly how do you \"come to terms with\" or \"make sense of\" the murder of a child?</p> <p>Moreland, who has worked in the voluntary sector for 30 years, decided the last thing her lively, attractive daughter would have wanted was for her to live the rest of her life in anguish. She gradually decided she wanted to meet the man who had taken her daughter's life. \"I wanted to find out more about what kind of person he was and what had been going on in his life before he killed Ruth. He didn't give evidence at his trial, so there had been no opportunity to form a first-hand opinion of him. I wanted to hear from him directly, in his own words, what had happened and why he killed Ruth. I felt he owed me an explanation.\"</p> <p>Andrew Steel was jailed for life, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 13 years. What troubled Moreland, she says, was that he could just \"sit it out\" in prison. \"He would be with people who knew neither him nor us, and I couldn't see how he could be helped to understand what he had done and why. People said I should forget him but this was impossible.\"</p> <p>The criminal justice system was not used to such requests from the relatives of victims and for years Moreland found her attempts to meet Steel rebuffed. Finally, four years later, she was given permission to meet him, in 1995, in the company of a prison probation officer.</p> <p>At their meeting, Steel told Moreland that Ruth had been kind and supportive to him - which made the killing even more difficult for her to understand. He told her that when he had staggered into Ruth's home that night, she had told him to go away and had hit him, and he had \"totally lost control\". He explained that his own mother had said she would never forgive him for what he had done and he told Moreland that he cried every night. \"You and me both, sunshine,\" she thought.</p> <p>\"Adrenalin levels were running high,\" Moreland says. \"It was a very high-risk thing to do for everyone and it could have gone badly wrong. I wasn't scared in terms of feeling under threat, because I knew the officer who was going to be with us. My fears were that either he wouldn't be able to speak about it because he was so overcome or daunted, or that he might attempt to tough it out and not engage with me.\"</p> <p>At the end of the 90-minute meeting, Steel said he was scared and ashamed. They shook hands before he was taken back to his cell and Moreland was told later that after the meeting, he'd had his first night of undisturbed sleep since killing Ruth.</p> <p>Moreland's book has a twist to it because there is another story within it, of her correspondence, starting the year Ruth died, with Micheal, an American prisoner now in his 15th year on death row in Texas. She got in touch with him via an organisation that matches penfriends in and out of prison. Eventually she also met the daughter of the woman he had killed.</p> <p>\"She was the same age as Ruth and I wasn't a dissimilar age to her mother. By the time we met, we'd had a lot of email and phone contact, but I did wonder how she would feel when she came face-to-face with me. The fact was, I had this personal friendship with the man who had killed her mother.\" Moreland says they \"negotiated the potential problems\" and now have \"a comfortable and warm relationship\".</p> <p>Through her experiences on both sides of the Atlantic, Moreland was able to explore the ways in which the relatives of murder victims and the murderers themselves are treated in the different cultures. She has traced the ways in which people can survive, can lead their lives amidst it all. People have different ways of doing it. Neither her husband nor her other daughter has read the book and she feels perhaps they never will. \"They are both very private and they would not have chosen to bring the circumstances of Ruth's death into the public arena. But one of the themes of the book is that people react very differently and there has to be support for them to do that. It is much to their credit that neither of them asked me not to write it.\"</p> <p>Many will understand the reaction of her family, but others who read the book may also feel that Lesley Moreland, by exploring a different way of confronting murder, has opened some locked doors within the criminal justice system. With luck, it will renew the sometimes floundering debate on the issue of \"restorative justice\".</p> <p>Micheal is still on death row; Steel remains in prison and will not be released for a while. Moreland, meanwhile, has plans for another book on a different subject.</p> <p>\"I still struggle with the issue of forgiveness,\" she concludes. \"It doesn't dominate my life but it niggles away in the background. I don't cry so often now but my heart still contracts painfully if, while we are eating our evening meal, the doorbell rings.\"</p> <p>\u0095 An Ordinary Murder by Lesley Moreland is published on March 22 by Aurum Press at \u00a314.99.</p>",

What troubled Moreland, she says, was that he could just \"sit it out\" in prison. \"He would be with people who knew neither him nor us, and I couldn't see how he could be helped to understand what he had done and why. People said I should forget him but this was impossible.\" The criminal justice system was not used to such requests from the relatives of victims and for years Moreland found her attempts to meet Steel rebuffed. Finally, four years later, she was given permission to meet him, in 1995, in the company of a prison probation officer. At their meeting, Steel told Moreland that Ruth had been kind and supportive to him - which made the killing even more difficult for her to understand. He told her that when he had staggered into Ruth's home that night, she had told him to go away and had hit him, and he had \"totally lost control\". He explained that his own mother had said she would never forgive him for what he had done and he told Moreland that he cried every night. \"You and me both, sunshine,\" she thought. \"Adrenalin levels were running high,\" Moreland says. \"It was a very high-risk thing to do for everyone and it could have gone badly wrong. I wasn't scared in terms of feeling under threat, because I knew the officer who was going to be with us. My fears were that either he wouldn't be able to speak about it because he was so overcome or daunted, or that he might attempt to tough it out and not engage with me.\" At the end of the 90-minute meeting, Steel said he was scared and ashamed. They shook hands before he was taken back to his cell and Moreland was told later that after the meeting, he'd had his first night of undisturbed sleep since killing Ruth. Moreland's book has a twist to it because there is another story within it, of her correspondence, starting the year Ruth died, with Micheal, an American prisoner now in his 15th year on death row in Texas. She got in touch with him via an organisation that matches penfriends in and out of prison. Eventually she also met the daughter of the woman he had killed. \"She was the same age as Ruth and I wasn't a dissimilar age to her mother. By the time we met, we'd had a lot of email and phone contact, but I did wonder how she would feel when she came face-to-face with me. The fact was, I had this personal friendship with the man who had killed her mother.\" Moreland says they \"negotiated the potential problems\" and now have \"a comfortable and warm relationship\". Through her experiences on both sides of the Atlantic, Moreland was able to explore the ways in which the relatives of murder victims and the murderers themselves are treated in the different cultures. She has traced the ways in which people can survive, can lead their lives amidst it all. People have different ways of doing it. Neither her husband nor her other daughter has read the book and she feels perhaps they never will. \"They are both very private and they would not have chosen to bring the circumstances of Ruth's death into the public arena. But one of the themes of the book is that people react very differently and there has to be support for them to do that. It is much to their credit that neither of them asked me not to write it.\" Many will understand the reaction of her family, but others who read the book may also feel that Lesley Moreland, by exploring a different way of confronting murder, has opened some locked doors within the criminal justice system. With luck, it will renew the sometimes floundering debate on the issue of \"restorative justice\". Micheal is still on death row; Steel remains in prison and will not be released for a while. Moreland, meanwhile, has plans for another book on a different subject. \"I still struggle with the issue of forgiveness,\" she concludes. \"It doesn't dominate my life but it niggles away in the background. I don't cry so often now but my heart still contracts painfully if, while we are eating our evening meal, the doorbell rings.\" \u0095 An Ordinary Murder by Lesley Moreland is published on March 22 by Aurum Press at \u00a314.99.",

      "bodyText": "Three years after Japan narrowly averted a financial crisis that threatened to bring down the global banking system, it is once again racked by self-doubt, political drift and dire economic warnings. The stock markets are at a 16-year low, the yen at levels not seen since early 1999 and, with the biggest public debt in the world, the finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa warned last week that the fiscal situation is close to collapse. Leadership has never been more important, nor more obviously lacking. A political vacuum is growing around the spectacularly unpopular prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, who has indicated that he intends to resign but will not say when. His ruling Liberal Democratic Party is racked by infighting about a successor and scorned by an electorate that is increasingly turning its back on mainstream political parties. This is a country that is deeply unhappy with itself. Suicide rates, unemployment, bankruptcies and crime are all near or at record highs. The comforting old stereotypes are fading. Salarymen are anxious about the loss of old certainties like lifetime employment and promotion according to age, while fearing the rising presence of foreign competitors in the domestic market. Office ladies are disgruntled about pay inequality and the lack of promotion opportunities. They are also putting off marriage and children, which has led to one of the lowest birthrates in the world. Even schoolchildren and the elderly are increasingly seen as a threat: the former because of rising juvenile crime, the latter because Japan's rapidly ageing society is pushing the health and pension systems close to bankruptcy. Such is the sense of crisis that nobody batted an eyelid recently when nationalistic former prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone dubbed Japan \"the sick man of Asia.\" It's a striking turnaround from 10 years ago, when Japan was held up as a model for the world. Four decades of miraculous growth had given its population of 126 million an economy second in size only to the United States. Government redistribution policies had minimised the income gap between rich and poor, city and country to the point where it was the envy of communists. Social scientists from across the globe flew to Tokyo to study how the country had achieved low crime rates, 100 per cent literacy levels and the longest average life-span in human history. With asset prices inflated by an economic bubble, Japan was selling at such a premium that the imperial palace grounds in Tokyo were estimated to be worth as much as the whole of California. It couldn't last and it didn't. After the bubble burst in 1989, land and stock prices came crashing down - and with them went belief in the \"Japanese miracle\", much of which turned out to be a simple sleight of hand by banks that were too willing to extend loans. The years since, which are seen in Japan as \"the lost decade\", have been marked by a near-stagnant economy and a prolonged bout of finger pointing. In 1993, for the first time in almost four decades, the ruling Liberal Democratic party lost its grip on power as a result of a multibillion yen corruption scandal. In the eight years since, Japan has had seven prime ministers and a series of short-lived coalition governments. Meanwhile, the businessmen and bureaucrats who were lauded during the years of growth have been undermined by scandal after scandal. The spotlight of criticism has spread throughout society with doctors, police and judges - all of whom previously enjoyed an almost exulted position - under fire. The education system, which was formally held up as a model for the world, is also racked by doubt as the government tracks back and forth between insisting on more focus on traditional group-oriented values and greater scope for free-thinking individualism. Behind all these problems is the mother of all identity crises. Japan, a country that pursued a policy of isolation for centuries, has been trying to \"catch up\" ever since it opened up to the west in 1853. While stressing the uniqueness of the nation, the government and leading businesses have simultaneously tried to emulate the west. The result was the model of Japan Inc that has become the victim of its own success. Having caught up and overtaken the west in so many ways in 1990, the country has lost its goal and been drifting ever since. How long it will continue to do so is the subject of intense debate. And a reason why many commentators and reformers hope that the current crisis will act as a purgative to get the sick man of Asia back on its feet.

The children's TV company has boomed on the back of the animated series. However, there has been mounting concern the group relies too heavily on a character that accounts for over 60% of turnover. However, HIT said pre-tax profits for the six months to January had risen 50% to \u00a33m. Turnover climbed 42% to \u00a312.8m as Bob got to grips with the US market. Following his debut on children's channel Nickelodeon in January, Bob is already the second biggest pre-school series on cable TV in the US. A toy range is planned to launch in the US in the summer. HIT's determination to crack the US market was emphasised last month when it bought Lyrick, home of Barney the dinosaur, for \u00a3190m. Although Barney has been around since the early 90s, he has recently signed up to fresh broadcasting, toy manufacturing and publishing agreements. HIT also has high hopes for its new series, Angelina Ballerina, which is expected reduce the dependency on Bob the Builder. Angelina will make her debut on ITV in September and the series has been pre-sold in 20 countries.

European telecoms companies spent \u00a397bn over the past year, mainly on prohibitively priced next-generation mobile phone licences. All the major telecoms operators have had their credit ratings downgraded. This makes it harder of them to raise debt and increase investors' scepticism about the profitability of telecoms stocks. The disastrous float of France Telecom's Orange, which immediately sank below its slashed issue price, has compounded BT's fears about the wisdom of a Wireless flotation. \"It would be very hard for BT to get any sort of mobile issue away in the current market,\" said Paul Mount, telecoms analyst at Nomura. However, a BT spokeswoman today said the group was steaming ahead with the flotation, which was announced last November and is expected to raise \u00a35bn. \"We still intend to float up to 25% of BT Wireless by the end of the year. A rights issue is not something we would rule out but we have never said we were going to do it,\" she said. Attention is now likely to turn to Philip Hampton, BT's recently appointed finance director. He had little influence on the recent restructuring plans. Investors believe he is a fan of a complete break-up of the company, which many believe is the only way to wring value out of the former telecoms monopoly. One analyst, who met Mr Hampton recently, supported calls for him to be given the chief executive role should Sir Bonfield be forced out. \"Philip Hampton is extremely positive for the company and we think he is in favour of breaking it up,\" he said. BT's shares slipped 3.8% or 21.5p to 534p in early trading.

      "bodyText": "Europe's highest court has cast doubt on the legality of Sweden's ban on alcohol advertising. The ruling could undermine many of the laws governing European advertising. The European court of justice ruled that the total ban on alcohol advertising went against European law after a Swedish food and drink magazine complained about the ban. Sweden, which bans all TV, press and radio advertising for spirits, wine and beer, will now have to justify the ban to the court. EU experts say the case sets a precedent for other advertising regulation. A European Commission spokesman said the ban puts non-domestic advertisers at a disadvantage to local competitors and is therefore discriminatory. The decision opens the way for the advertising industry to challenge other national restrictions in the European courts. These could include Sweden's ban on advertising aimed at children and Germany's ban on lifetime guarantees and two for the price of one sales promotions. France also operates restrictions on alcohol advertising. The European Commission was forced to abandon plans for a EU-wide ban on tobacco advertising last year after the European court of justice ruled it was illegal. The court decided the issue of whether to ban cigarette advertising should instead be decided by individual member states. Related story Dec 6: Tobacco ad ban 'by next summer'",

No one can dispute the way this has lifted 1.2m children and 800,000 adults out of poverty.

But why not restore what they have lost since Margaret Thatcher broke the earnings link in 1981? That has cost every single pensioner \u00a330 a week, and a couple \u00a345. MIG should be lifted to these levels. Third, restore the old role of the social fund, set up to meet emergency needs of the poor (a cooker, bed or furniture). The Tories ended the grant system and insisted that loans become the main source of help - despite the desperate plight of applicants. This is plunging poor people into even further debt.

      "body": "<p>When Tony Blair asked Nick Brown to switch from the post of chief whip and head for the political Siberia that is the Ministry of Agriculture, the deeply urbane Brown told the prime minister: \"You do know I am a vegan\". Mr Blair's smile stalled for a second before he realised that Brown was joking. Mr Blair evidently tried to share the sense of humour.</p> <p>Since this unlikely transfer, his job has been anything but a joke. He has generally been seen as a success, even if the agriculture industry has struggled desperately through two successive years of fast falling income.</p> <p>He handled the fall-out from the BSE crisis without seeking to make party political points, and it seemed that when the cursed luck struck farmers again in the form of floods and swine fever, it was time that the gods must finally smile down upon them.</p> <p>Instead they, and Mr Brown, were given foot and mouth disease. Apart from a silly spat with his opposite number, the sensible Tim Yeo, over whether or not to stage a Commons debate, the issue has been clear of party politics.</p> <p>Over the weekend, however, the tone started to change. There had been hopes that, with a two-week incubation period, the disease would show signs of coming under control. Instead the number of cases escalated and, disturbingly, many started to appear on unexpected farms.</p> <p>The vets lost the trail of the disease - it seemed pretty evident it was being carried by the wind, something not even the tightest Maff regulation can control. The Ministry of Agriculture had imposed tight controls on the transport of livestock and made funeral pyres of any diseased stock.</p> <p>The controls, however, were not working, as the disease spread to Gloucestershire and Kent for the first time. The number of confirmed cases reached 173 and the chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, admitted surprise and concern at the speed of the outbreak.</p> <p>The normally unflappable Mr Brown nevertheless insisted the disease was contained and almost every outbreak could be traced. Maff officials pointed out that there had been 80 new cases in one day in 1967.</p> <p>In the reassuring manner of a chief whip, he promised all would be well. In this he has so far retained the support of the NFU president, Ben Gill, even if, in the regions, the NFU mood is much darker. They claim there are many unexplained cases.</p> <p>Yet Mr Yeo pounced - if gently - by demanding tighter controls, the intervention of the army and a halt to convoys of animals going to slaughterhouses. He argued that we are facing a national emergency, that the French and Irish had taken tougher measures and that Maff were not giving sufficiently clear guidance.</p> <p>However, Mr Yeo has yet to spell out in detail what he would do differently, or where Maff has gone wrong.

      "bodyText": "When Tony Blair asked Nick Brown to switch from the post of chief whip and head for the political Siberia that is the Ministry of Agriculture, the deeply urbane Brown told the prime minister: \"You do know I am a vegan\". Mr Blair's smile stalled for a second before he realised that Brown was joking. Mr Blair evidently tried to share the sense of humour. Since this unlikely transfer, his job has been anything but a joke. He has generally been seen as a success, even if the agriculture industry has struggled desperately through two successive years of fast falling income. He handled the fall-out from the BSE crisis without seeking to make party political points, and it seemed that when the cursed luck struck farmers again in the form of floods and swine fever, it was time that the gods must finally smile down upon them. Instead they, and Mr Brown, were given foot and mouth disease. Apart from a silly spat with his opposite number, the sensible Tim Yeo, over whether or not to stage a Commons debate, the issue has been clear of party politics. Over the weekend, however, the tone started to change. There had been hopes that, with a two-week incubation period, the disease would show signs of coming under control. Instead the number of cases escalated and, disturbingly, many started to appear on unexpected farms. The vets lost the trail of the disease - it seemed pretty evident it was being carried by the wind, something not even the tightest Maff regulation can control. The Ministry of Agriculture had imposed tight controls on the transport of livestock and made funeral pyres of any diseased stock. The controls, however, were not working, as the disease spread to Gloucestershire and Kent for the first time. The number of confirmed cases reached 173 and the chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, admitted surprise and concern at the speed of the outbreak. The normally unflappable Mr Brown nevertheless insisted the disease was contained and almost every outbreak could be traced. Maff officials pointed out that there had been 80 new cases in one day in 1967. In the reassuring manner of a chief whip, he promised all would be well. In this he has so far retained the support of the NFU president, Ben Gill, even if, in the regions, the NFU mood is much darker. They claim there are many unexplained cases. Yet Mr Yeo pounced - if gently - by demanding tighter controls, the intervention of the army and a halt to convoys of animals going to slaughterhouses. He argued that we are facing a national emergency, that the French and Irish had taken tougher measures and that Maff were not giving sufficiently clear guidance. However, Mr Yeo has yet to spell out in detail what he would do differently, or where Maff has gone wrong. Until he does, the political fall-out will not be that dangerous. The big political pressure on Labour will come in the next few weeks, when it has to be decided whether or not to press on with a May 3 election. If the number of cases goes on rising, and movement restrictions remain, it will be very difficult to argue Blair has called a free and fair election. With a year of the parliamentary term to go, he will also need to explain the urgency for the election. There may be only 150 or so constituencies in which more than 1,000 members of the electorate are directly involved in farming, but they are vocal enough to turn the election into something of a farce.

As someone said, this was more space than the paper had given Graham Greene on his death. The Guardian also had two pieces on Waugh, one an unusually long obituary (by me as it happens). Then John Diamond died, and the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph lavished space on him. As for the Times, apart from a full-dress obituary, and a leader, it covered his death on pages 1, 3, 20, and 21.

I know who Jenkins, Waugh and Diamond were. They were colleagues and friends of mine, whom I liked and admired. And yet, as a journalist I am left with an uneasy feeling. A cynic might say that it shows no more than media solipsism, or Fleet Street up itself. A better-informed cynic would say that newspapers nowadays have more space than they know how to fill. But there is more to it.

A hundred years ago, cabinet ministers were paid \u00a35,000 a year, getting on for three times what they earn today in real terms, and very few journalists indeed, even editors, were paid as much. Even in 1974 when WF Deedes - a journalist who had become an MP and briefly a cabinet minister - was made editor of the Daily Telegraph, his salary was less than the prime minister's at the time. </p> <p>Today, I doubt very much indeed whether any national newspaper editor, quite apart from Paul Dacre with his \u00a3727,000, is paid less than the \u00a3116,339 which Tony Blair will receive after his next rise. There are now plenty of columnists making \u00a3100,000 a year, several making \u00a3200,000, and a few said to be making \u00a3300,000 (this writer not among them).

      "bodyText": "If there were any justice in politics, Keith Vaz would today be sacked as Europe minister while Peter Mandelson would once again be taking up residence in Belfast as Northern Ireland secretary. Today's commons report into Mr Vaz's business affairs damns the Europe minister for breaching the MPs' code of conduct when he recommended an acquaintance for an honour without disclosing their financial links. In a blow to Tony Blair's claim that his government would be purer than pure, Mr Vaz is also reprimanded for high-handed behaviour towards the parliamentary standards watchdog. Few officials come straighter than the watchdog Elizabeth Filkin - yet she was unable to complete her inquiries in eight areas because Mr Vaz, speaking through his lawyer, refused last December to answer further questions from her. \"Mr Vaz was wrong to say to the commissioner last December that he was not prepared to answer further questions from her,\" today's report by the Commons Standards and Privileges committee concludes. \"All members have a duty to cooperate with the commissioner.\" Had a Tory minister been criticised in such terms before the last election, the likes of Mr Vaz would have lined up to demand their head on a plate for breaching the MPs' code of conduct. Yet Mr Vaz today protested his innocence after he was cleared of improper financial behaviour on all but one count. \"I am absolutely delighted at the complete rejection by the Committee on Standards and Privileges and by the Parliamentary Commissioner Elizabeth Filkin of all the allegations made against me save one, which was raised by the Commissioner herself,\" Mr Vaz declared. A minister with a surer political touch would show a bit of humility in the face of the committee's criticisms. But Mr Vaz takes a swipe at Ms Filkin's investigations. \"While I fully support the need to ensure that MPs maintain the highest possible standards of probity, the present procedures give too much latitude to the purveyors of lies and malice,\" he said. Downing Street will be privately dismayed by Mr Vaz's conduct throughout this entire affair. When Tony Blair picks up the telephone to Peter Mandelson - they are said to be in regular contact once again - the prime minister will struggle to explain why Mr Vaz should hold onto his red ministerial box while his old friend has no prospect of winning his back.

But the sight of Anthea Turner's face on both occasions was a voyeur's treat. By last night, Celebrity Big Brother had caught the imagination of the nation with a combined audience of close to 10m viewers. The half-hour special on Channel 4 was watched by 4.1m viewers, while another 5.1m viewers caught the 10-minute update on BBC1. And the interest was enough to dent BBC1's big Sunday night drama Ballykissangel, which was left with a rather miserable 4.8m. Comic Relief's celebrity edition of the hit Channel 4 show started on Friday night featuring six volunteer celebrities. Ms Feltz, Ms Turner, Jack Dee, Chris Eubank, Claire Sweeney from Brookside and Boyzone star Keith Duffy are being ejected gradually from the Big Brother house over the course of a week. The first instalment almost doubled Channel 4's normal share of viewers - it attracted an 18.4% slice of those watching TV at the time. Saturday night's viewing made for the most drama. Mr Eubank was unable to contain his hostility towards the Boyzone star, who a year previously grabbed the ex-boxer's gonads as a gesture of \"fun\" at a celebrity fashion show. Although the pair didn't come to blows, the incident created the dramatic tension the show needed. Last night's escape attempt by Mr Dee, however, had all the hallmarks of a scripted stunt. On Saturday, Mr Eubank also showed his concern for the women on the team, when he took Ms Sweeney aside to mumble that her \"knickers were showing\". It was a performance that probably broke all Mr Eubank's audience records - 3.7m viewers tuned in to the Channel 4 show. The update on the BBC brought in another 5.9m viewers. Elsewhere, Channel 5 hopes it has a hit on its hands with its US import Touch the Truck. The bizarre endurance contest, in which 20 contestants hold on to a vehicle for as long as they can, was watched by 1m viewers.",

The Royal National Institute for Deaf People said it was told by Customs and Excise on Friday that the judgment was also likely to lead to VAT on the private dispensing of hearing aids.

Eighteen years later it is still regarded, by common consent in the world of criminal justice, as the worst prison in Britain. </p> <p>In yet another shocking inspection report to be published on Thursday, Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, will confirm that the \"Prosser prison\" still deserves its dismal title. \"Rambo\" will detail the full extent of the \"appalling\" and \"filthy\" conditions inside the Birmingham prison when he inspected it last July. He will highlight the case of a mentally ill prisoner who was denied a change of clothes for weeks on end, and conclude that things are actually worse than when he last visited the place in 1995 and 1998. </p> <p>In a pre-emptive strike last month designed to shock the prison service out of its lethargy, Martin Narey, the director-general, threatened to resign and made it clear he accepts the expected Ramsbotham verdict. Indeed he went further and clearly hinted he believes that physical brutality still goes on within its walls. </p> <p>To sweeten the pill, the chief inspector's report on Armley prison, Leeds, once the most destructive of the prison service's overcrowded \"hellholes\", will be published on the same day as the Birmingham indictment. It will reveal a prison which has been been prepared to change its approach to create a more healthy environment. </p> <p>But it will only underline the tragic merry-go-round that lies at the heart of our prison system. Last year it was the young offenders' institution at Portland that was exposed as a national disgrace. Now it is said to provide the best care for juveniles in the country. Instead, Brinsford youth jail, near Wolverhampton, and Stoke Heath, in Shropshire, provide the latest examples of what has been called \"the litany of failure and moral neglect\". Meanwhile as last night's Panorama television programme once again demonstrated, the numbers held inside the largest of our young offender institutions, Feltham, in west London, mean it repeatedly fails to fulfil its basic duty of care. With four governors in four years, its recent history features teenage suicides and the racist murder of Zahid Mubarek. </p> <p>The situation in Birmingham and Feltham represents something more fundamental than an occasional failure. It demonstrates that over a period of 20 years or more there has been an underlying malaise in the prison system which has never really been tackled. </p> <p>Part of the problem is that prisons are not seen as a public service. When the chancellor, Gordon Brown, stood up last week to announce his extra billions for hospitals and schools, nobody expected him to do the same for prisons. Yet we do expect 130,000 of our citizens each year to endure conditions that are frequently condemned as indecent by those whom we appoint to inspect them. Not all of the reports are negative, but Ramsbotham only gets round the 135 establishments once every six years. </p> <p>Perhaps if all prisoners were given the vote, politicians would take as much interest in them as they do in their local police station or school. It may be news to some MPs, but the punishment involved in a prison sentence is supposed to be the loss of liberty - not living in the inhumane conditions inside some of our jails. </p> <p> Tony Blair may have been the first serving prime minister to visit a prison but the malaise has become so deep-seated in some parts of the prison system that more radical solutions are needed. It is time to consider publicly one option that is already being debated privately within the Home Office. The prison service has proved itself incapable of running some types of jails. The first that come to mind are young offender institutions and women's prisons - both of which are completely different propositions from the average local prison holding 800 men serving short to medium sentences. </p> <p>Perhaps it is time to realise that the adult prison service is no longer fit to look after young teenage offenders or women prisoners and that \"prison culture\" is simply not what the punishment and rehabilitation of these groups of offenders is about. In nearly all non-violent cases they are quite simply different from the thousands of career criminals who fill some of our prisons. In the case of young offenders, the government should once again approach the children's charities and other non-profit organisations - or even local authorities - to see if they are willing to get involved in the provision of secure accommodation for such teenagers. </p> <p>They turned their backs when Michael Howard came touting his secure training centres, on the grounds that they were more about punishment than education, and left it to Group 4, with initially disastrous results. Smaller but more units is the way to go, so that 900 youngsters are never held together again as they once were in the Feltham warehouse. The network of women's prisons would benefit from a similar exercise.</p>",

Perhaps if all prisoners were given the vote, politicians would take as much interest in them as they do in their local police station or school. It may be news to some MPs, but the punishment involved in a prison sentence is supposed to be the loss of liberty - not living in the inhumane conditions inside some of our jails. Tony Blair may have been the first serving prime minister to visit a prison but the malaise has become so deep-seated in some parts of the prison system that more radical solutions are needed. It is time to consider publicly one option that is already being debated privately within the Home Office. The prison service has proved itself incapable of running some types of jails. The first that come to mind are young offender institutions and women's prisons - both of which are completely different propositions from the average local prison holding 800 men serving short to medium sentences. Perhaps it is time to realise that the adult prison service is no longer fit to look after young teenage offenders or women prisoners and that \"prison culture\" is simply not what the punishment and rehabilitation of these groups of offenders is about. In nearly all non-violent cases they are quite simply different from the thousands of career criminals who fill some of our prisons. In the case of young offenders, the government should once again approach the children's charities and other non-profit organisations - or even local authorities - to see if they are willing to get involved in the provision of secure accommodation for such teenagers. They turned their backs when Michael Howard came touting his secure training centres, on the grounds that they were more about punishment than education, and left it to Group 4, with initially disastrous results. Smaller but more units is the way to go, so that 900 youngsters are never held together again as they once were in the Feltham warehouse. The network of women's prisons would benefit from a similar exercise.",

      "body": "<p>My daily walk to work takes me from a redeveloping neighbourhood in a big northern conurbation, past rubble-strewn wastelands which housed the metal bashers and mill workers of the world's first industrial city, down eerie underpasses below expressways which plough through former communities - and into the centre itself. In barely a mile, I leave new houses valued at little more than \u00a350,000 before hitting trendy, canal-side loft apartments which can sell for up to a \u00a31m. Manchester city centre, like the cores of Leeds, Newcastle and - increasingly - Liverpool, is thriving. Developers are falling over themselves to buy old mills and workshops written off as worthless 10 years ago. Everyone, from exclusive retailers to expensive restaurateurs, wants in. </p> <p>But, as a report undertaken for the Guardian by Professor Brian Robson of Manchester University says, cheek by jowl with the new penthouses, restaurants, and up-market stores, lies \"the land of the forgotten ... the endless rows of impoverished terrace housing and half empty council housing where unemployment is horrendous, where houses sell - if at all - for under \u00a310,000, where crime ... traps people in their homes, where drugs are common currency...\" </p> <p>Northern cities are increasingly characterised by the reverse of the north American \"doughnut\" phenomenon, in which original city centres become hollowed out and deserted. In Britain's north, vibrant rebuilt centres are surrounded by wastelands, with many trapped in a cycle of negative equity. </p> <p> A long the M62 corridor, from Liverpool to Manchester and the Lancashire towns, 280,000 homes (100,000 of them private properties) are blighted, according to recent research by Birmingham University. The wider north-west already has more derelict land than anywhere else in the country - tens of thousands of acres eminently suitable for redevelopment. </p> <p>Ministers are now committed to an ambitious policy of neighbourhood renewal, with a promise to pump hundreds of millions into deprived communities, linked to an array of performance targets. This all seems extremely promising. The government does take poverty seriously. But, as Brian Robson points out in his report, if government policy is now to focus on the neighbourhood and the general delivery of council services (fine for London, no doubt), it will miss some of the main causes of poverty and deprivation it is trying to ameliorate in the north. </p> <p>Poor communities, he argues, do not emerge in a vacuum. Their fortunes reflect the wider economies of cities in which they exist. The challenge, then, is not to wait for that elusive \"trickle down\", but to act positively to channel city centre wealth to the outer ring. With government grants to town halls now skewed in favour of London and the south, because northern cities and conurbations are losing people, that task is not easy, although ministers are now - belatedly - considering switching some funds from south to north by revising a complex Whitehall spending formula. The government's equally ambitious regional agenda - creating eight development agencies (RDAs) and pushing up their budgets by \u00a3500m - has yet to have any impact because it was not quite clear what the RDAs were meant to achieve: the south-east RDA, for instance, sees its task as going for yet more growth at all costs to compete with the super-regions of Europe. </p> <p>It wants to keep the big corporate headquarters, and research labs along the M4 and around Oxford, with the less-favoured regions taking the more mundane back office functions. Such a policy, not surprisingly, has pushed regions such as the north-east - and the cities of the north - further down the prosperity league table. </p> <p>On the day that Professor Robson produced his report, government statisticians published even more sobering figures showing - yes -that the north-south divide had actually widened under New Labour. In its first three years, GDP per head in the north-east had fallen by a point to 23% below the national average - while London was almost 30% above. Not for nothing did the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, speak of \"unacceptably wide gaps\" between regions. While no one doubts his commitment to the challenge, it will take more than brave words to push provincial cities and their wider regions up the prosperity league. As Richard Rogers, chairman of the government's urban task force, recently said, this should top New Labour's agenda for a second term - with a minister for urban affairs in the cabinet. He might not have to wait too long.</p>",

But, as Brian Robson points out in his report, if government policy is now to focus on the neighbourhood and the general delivery of council services (fine for London, no doubt), it will miss some of the main causes of poverty and deprivation it is trying to ameliorate in the north. Poor communities, he argues, do not emerge in a vacuum. Their fortunes reflect the wider economies of cities in which they exist. The challenge, then, is not to wait for that elusive \"trickle down\", but to act positively to channel city centre wealth to the outer ring. With government grants to town halls now skewed in favour of London and the south, because northern cities and conurbations are losing people, that task is not easy, although ministers are now - belatedly - considering switching some funds from south to north by revising a complex Whitehall spending formula. The government's equally ambitious regional agenda - creating eight development agencies (RDAs) and pushing up their budgets by \u00a3500m - has yet to have any impact because it was not quite clear what the RDAs were meant to achieve: the south-east RDA, for instance, sees its task as going for yet more growth at all costs to compete with the super-regions of Europe. It wants to keep the big corporate headquarters, and research labs along the M4 and around Oxford, with the less-favoured regions taking the more mundane back office functions. Such a policy, not surprisingly, has pushed regions such as the north-east - and the cities of the north - further down the prosperity league table. On the day that Professor Robson produced his report, government statisticians published even more sobering figures showing - yes -that the north-south divide had actually widened under New Labour. In its first three years, GDP per head in the north-east had fallen by a point to 23% below the national average - while London was almost 30% above. Not for nothing did the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, speak of \"unacceptably wide gaps\" between regions. While no one doubts his commitment to the challenge, it will take more than brave words to push provincial cities and their wider regions up the prosperity league. As Richard Rogers, chairman of the government's urban task force, recently said, this should top New Labour's agenda for a second term - with a minister for urban affairs in the cabinet. He might not have to wait too long.",

      "bodyText": "Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe, was today cleared of impropriety - for the second time in four days. A report by the standards and privileges committee - parliament's watchdog on sleaze - found no evidence of any wrongdoing in the campaign donations declared by the Labour MP for Leicester East. But he is reprimanded on one minor count - a lack of openness in declaring a financial benefit from an Asian businessman whom Mr Vaz recommended for an honour in 1997. The dossier was compiled by standards commissioner Elizabeth Filkin after allegations that Mr Vaz had accepted donations from businessmen in his constituency without declaring them. Ms Filkin criticises members of Mr Vaz's constituency Labour party for not helping her with her inquiries - but dismisses a further eight complaints against the MP. The conclusion comes just days after the controversial foreign office minister was cleared by the Hammond report of any impropriety in his relationship with the billionaire Hinduja brothers. Mr Vaz has always declared his innocence during the 13-month investigation into his affairs - and friends of the MP have claimed the accusations are part of a racist witch-hunt. The allegations surfaced when Andrew Milne, a former employee of City lawyer Sarosh Zaiwalla, claimed that his boss had paid \u00a32,000 for an office for the then-opposition MP, and that the money was not properly declared and accounted for. The inquiry was widened to include allegations that Mr Vaz took money from businessmen in his constituency, one of whom sought help with a planning application. He also admitted using the Foreign Office building in Whitehall for a meeting between an Asian restaurateur and Labour party donor, and an insurance firm. The Foreign Office confirmed the unusual meeting - but declared it did not breach the ministerial code of conduct. At the height of the Hinduja affair it was also disclosed that Mr Vaz had viewed a central London townhouse valued at \u00a3900,000 - despite his ministerial salary of \u00a382,697. Following this revelation, a group of Asian peers and businessmen wrote to the Times claiming Mr Vaz was the victim of a racist vendetta. Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker - whose parliamentary questions set in motion the chain of events which lead to Peter Mandelson's most recent ministerial resignation - said this morning: \"The key issue which runs through the government - not just Mr Vaz, but Mr Mandelson, Lord Irvine and others as well - is that increasingly what we are seeing is blurred edges between ministerial roles, party political roles and personal roles. \"I think that is dangerous.

      "body": "<p>David Briffett has been a journalist for 46 years and an editor for 35 of them. For the past 24 years he has edited the West Sussex County Times in Horsham, and he expected to retire next Friday without a stain on his character after a successful and satisfying career. </p> <p>Further down the county, Simon Bradshaw has edited the Brighton Evening Argus for almost three years, having spent half of his 21 years on newspapers as a senior executive. Until last week, he also had an unblemished record. </p> <p>These men run papers that are the backbone of the British press, the local weeklies and regional titles that exist to serve their communities. </p> <p>They are not risk-takers. They don't print scandalous kiss-and-tell stories. They try not to intrude into people's private lives unless there is good reason. </p> <p>Like all editors, they are conscious of the many laws which constrain what they can and cannot publish, especially when it comes to reporting on children involved in court cases. </p> <p>So on the day in February last year when a story appeared on their screens about a boy who had secured a judicial review of his expulsion from school, they noted that the court had imposed a section 39 order. This is the section of the 1933 children and young persons act which bans the media from identifying children in court hearings. </p> <p>Briffett and Bradshaw knew the drill: no name of boy, no name of school, no addresses, nothing that should lead their readers to identify the boy. </p> <p>The stories they published did give his age, but didn't make clear whether it was his current age or at the time he was expelled in 1998. They both stated the reasons for his expulsion, giving the exact date it happened and the exact date of his starting at another school. </p> <p>After publication, the boy's mother was furious. She claimed that the stories had enabled people in her community to identify her son. </p> <p>What followed was an extraordinary departure from legal precedent. After tightening the section 39 order, a judge gave a broad hint that the editors should be prosecuted for breaching the original order instead of suffering the much more usual penalty of being hauled before the high court for a contempt hearing. </p> <p>Briffett and Bradshaw were therefore charged with publishing articles that contravened section 39, a case heard before Mid-Sussex magistrates in Haywards Heath. Last week, that court found them guilty and fined the pair \u00a32,500 each, thus criminalising them. </p> <p>Their barrister, Gavin Millar QC, says: \"The whole exercise in taking them before a criminal court is inappropriate and disproportionate. They were making a professional judgment, and this conviction could well be in breach of the human rights act.\" </p> <p>The editors and the owners of their papers, Newsquest and Johnston Press, are sure to appeal, but the convictions show just how difficult, if not impossible, it is to make editorial decisions while carrying out the prime task of the press: to inform. </p> <p>Since I must also avoid falling foul of section 39, I cannot go into the details of the offending story, but my reading of it suggests that the boy's court victory was important for the Horsham community to know about. </p> <p>As for the case against Briffett and Bradshaw, it was clearly inadequate, if not absurd. It largely consisted of the boy's family and friends telling the court that, in their view, the story had identified the boy. Well it would, wouldn't it, because they already knew about the expulsion? In passing sentence on the editors, magistrate Rosemary Scott said: \"We accept that a total stranger would not be able to identify him from these reports but the question for us is to what extent persons with some knowledge of the boy would be able to identify him from the reports. </p> <p>\"We believe parliament's intention was to apply this law to this kind of person and not just a complete stranger.\" </p> <p>She accepted that work colleagues of the boy's mother had identified the boy because of their background knowledge and not because of the articles. </p> <p>The magistrate pointed out that another family friend, with children at the same school as the boy before he was excluded, had been able to identify him. </p> <p>So what? If papers are to have any merits at all, they must be able to publish information, even about children, which is important in the wider public interest. </p> <p>The editors had taken the necessary precautions by removing any details which could have led Horsham and district's 120,000 citizens who did not know the boy from discovering who he was. With six secondary schools in the area, it was also virtually impossible for anyone to recall who left one and started at another on specified dates some 21 months before. </p> <p>Briffett, whose paper sells 25,000 copies a week, is baffled and upset by the action against him. He says: \"We have a system here that the newsdesk flag up any section 39s. Then my deputy and I always go through the stories together. We felt it complied with the act and published in good faith. All editors face an impossible situation now. When these stories occur we have to try to ascertain who has prior information on the case without knowing what they know.\" </p> <p>As Bradshaw points out: \"Editors will be expected to second-guess what a close family friend knows. It could lead to us not reporting anything, and surely that isn't what parliament intended.\" </p> <p>Both men have received strong support from the society of editors. Director Bob Satchwell says the case has \"dangerous implications for the key principle of open justice.\" </p> <p>He echoes the editors' solicitor, Dominic Ward, who says that \"the danger of this [decision] is that it is likely to lead to a climate of self-censorship in the press.\" </p> <p>I share that view wholeheartedly and I also want to take issue with the magistrate's final admonition to Briffett and Bradshaw. \"You are both professionals in your field,\" she said, \"and you should have taken more care.\" </p> <p>That is manifestly unfair. They took great care. They are victims of an implausible restriction on freedom and the people's right to know. </p> <p>\u0095 Six weeks ago I wrote an article criticising Peter Mandelson in robust terms. Though I do not take back most of what I wrote, which centred on my belief that his poor relationship with the press stemmed from his manipulation of it, I must put the record straight. </p> <p>I accepted that he resigned because he made an inappropriate telephone call in support of Srichand Hinduja's bid to obtain a British passport. </p> <p>I would not have written so trenchant a piece unless I believed that to have been the case. The Hammond Report establishes that the position was a good deal more complex than it appeared at the time, and it seems only fair to apologise for the tone of the article I wrote then.

It is thought the 7.58am Sevenoaks train may have passed a signal at danger. Passengers from the Crayford train were able to exit their train onto the platform at Hither Green. Customers on the Sevenoaks train were led to safety after the power to the line had been switched off and all trains halted. The health and safety executive launched an immediate inquiry into the accident which comes less than two weeks after the Selby rail crash that claimed 10 lives. Train services in the south-east have been disrupted, with all mainline services from the Kent coast now diverted to London's Victoria station. Connex has advised passengers to expect severe delays and cancellations at short notice. Replacement bus services are being arranged.

      "bodyText": "The new premier of Quebec is a hot-tempered separatist who, before he was even sworn in last week, angered Quebeckers and Canadians alike by calling the Maple Leaf flag a red rag. Bernard Landry apologised for that outburst, which was provoked by the federal government having the cheek to insist that if it gave the French-speaking province millions to renovate a Quebec City zoo it wanted the Canadian flag to fly with the fleur-de-lis over the monkey pen. Mr Landry insinuated the conditional offer of funds turned the province into a prostitute, selling herself for bits of red rag. Speaking before he thinks is Mr Landry's biggest flaw, and many observers say his unseemly outbursts would have cost a lesser politician his career. (After the separatists lost the 1995 referendum, he yelled at an immigrant hotel clerk for voting No to sovereignty.) Widely regarded as passionate, talented and shrewd, Mr Landry has spent the past few decades as reliable lieutenant of the sovereignty movement. A lawyer with economic training, he brought the province's runaway deficit under control as finance minister. When outgoing premier Lucien Bouchard stepped down earlier this winter, Mr Landry was the crown prince, and no one in the Parti Quebecois challenged him for the leadership. He is at ease with the hard-liners in the party in a way that Mr Bouchard, a former federalist, never was. While Mr Bouchard was attractive and charismatic, Mr Landry is less appealing to voters, but a more comfortable fit with a party that was created to make Quebec a country. His temper means he will bring drama both to Quebec provincial politics and to the national scene, where he and the other nine premiers are permanently squabbling with the federal government over money and power. Mr Bouchard, known for the odd flare-up himself, was surprisingly cooperative when working with his counterparts in the rest of the country. Mr Landry, on the other hand, believes the Quebec premier is a cut above, and cannot be seen to accept parity with, say, the premier of tiny Prince Edward Island. There is no doubt he will fight with the federal government as much as he possibly can. Aside from the red rag incident, Mr Landry raised a stink when Ottawa announced it would be giving Quebec extra money this year. (The extra cash proves how hard done by the province is, according to Mr Landry.) He is also insisting Ottawa is gagging him by not allowing him to attend the upcoming Summit of Americas in Quebec City as an equal to the other world leaders. For all his bombast, it is doubtful if Mr Landry will bring Quebec any further down the road to nationhood. A recent poll found that half the people in the province oppose his plan to have the Quebec government actively promote sovereignty and only 15 per cent say they favour the outright independence of Quebec.

Saturday night: Chris \"concerned of Brighton\" Eubank taking Claire Sweeney from Brookside aside to tell her her knickers were visible above her jeans. Doesn't he know that's what thongs are for these days? The prize for the most nauseating performance goes to Anthea Turner on Saturday night. \"I have done so much live telly and this is really terrible,\" she said as she cast her votes for the first night's eviction. And the most disturbing sight of the night: Vanessa Feltz raising her new leopard skin pyjama to take off a big black pair of knickers. Thankfully the camera was held at a distance.",

The format will be similar to This Morning in that it will be studio based and smattered with video inserts and outside broadcasts - but the content will be focused entirely on health, beauty and the somewhat nebulous and holistic concept of \"wellbeing\". </p> <p>Primarily aimed at housewives, and perhaps workers prone to sickies, Wellbeing will be screened between 9am and 9pm each day and may eventually be promoted to a 24-hour channel. The full list of presenters is still being kept under wraps, but expect a number of high-profile women such as Toyah Wilcox, athlete Diane Modahl and Coleen Nolan. </p> <p>To launch its efforts into the world of health and beauty, Granada has teamed up with Boots the Chemist in a 40:60 deal which, on the surface, seems to be a retail broadcast match made in heaven. But it is not the first of its kind. Last year Carlton and Sainsbury's got together to work on Taste, a similar retail broadcast hybrid that will come to life as a TV channel and website on May 1. </p> <p>Of course, Wellbeing, like all new channels these days, is not just a TV channel. It's one of those \"multi-platform propositions\" that has all the right buzzwords: an integrated website, interactive TV within a year, ADSL, PDA and Wap, and so on. </p> <p>In the first instance, though, it is a website, Wellbeing.com, and a TV channel on Sky Digital and ONdigital. Eventually the plan is to feed content from the website onto an interactive version of the channel, but Paula Carter, former Granada health director and now joint managing director of Wellbeing with former Boots internet boss Richard Holmes, is cautious about doing too much with the business before working out what their audience wants. </p> <p>\"We've done a lot of research and we know there is a potential audience out there, but we're going to hold off making [Wellbeing] 24 hours until we find out what's working. Likewise, we are going to do interactive TV, but not necessarily sell products through it until we're sure how the audience is using interactive TV,\" says Carter. </p> <p>With operating costs for Wellbeing's first year - to the end of this month - already said to be close to \u00a318m, and a \u00a310m marketing campaign in the pipeline, it may take some time to move into the black. Revenues are expected to come from the sale of products and advertising, although it is questionable whether Wellbeing will be able to generate wads of cash given the current depressed advertising climate and its reluctance to sell products through the TV. Experts warn of a shortage of advertisers looking to target a small niche audience of women, particularly when the advertisers may not take too kindly to the involvement of Boots in the channel. Keith Rattray, director of interactive TV at Carat, says: \"If extremely specialist interest services such as health channels are vying for a share of total TV revenue spent on traditional 'spot' advertising, then they're going to struggle. Reason being that they can not offer advertisers sufficient volume of impacts to make any difference to their coverage-building schedules.\" Rattray suggests that traditional advertising spots will be relatively scarce on Wellbeing, with advertorials, sponsorships and interactive workshops becoming more lucrative money-spinners for the channel instead. </p> <p>Simon Shaps, managing director at Granada Broadband, is expecting revenues to come from sponsors and advertising, bolstered by transactional revenues from products sold on the website. But will these be enough to sustain the business in the medium term, bearing in mind that Boots has recently lost its sparkle in the City? </p> <p>Competitors are naturally questioning the economics of launching a TV channel that may take time to make consumers aware of its existence, and a website trying to make a business for itself in a tumultuous sector that has already killed off ClickMango. </p> <p>Carol Dukes, chief executive at internet health and beauty retailer ThinkNatural, says: \"More specialist sites find that a lot of their appeal lies in the fact that people can find, research and order online those types of things that are a bit harder to find or which would require a special shopping trip. That motivation won't exist for Boots' products online, because everyone can easily pop into a Boots - they're on every high street and in every shopping mall.\" </p> <p>But Wellbeing remains bullish. It expects to take a bite out of the \u00a311bn UK health and beauty retail market and then expand into the bigger \u00a390bn area of healthcare provision. For Boots, the launch is part of its efforts to evolve from a health and beauty retailer into a generic brand for health, beauty and wellbeing. Such is the retailer's confidence that Boots.co.uk has been absorbed into the Wellbeing website, which will exist as the cornerstone of Boots' digital strategy. </p> <p>Whether viewers will sit down and lap up 12 hours a day of this type of programming has yet to be established. Granada's research indicates widespread support for a health and beauty channel and associated website. Shaps thinks Granada is onto a mass-market opportunity. \"The combination of an encyclopaedic website and an information-based TV channel will have wide appeal. This is a large scale venture that will have universal interest because everybody has a profound interest in their own wellbeing.\" </p> <p>Dukes thinks Wellbeing may have its work cut out trying to create demand for such category-specific programming. \"It's very brave of Granada and Boots to launch into the expensive territory of television when general non-drama health programming is such an untested area for popular viewing.\" </p> <p>Potential pitfalls aside, Granada is making a brave move. Over the next 12 months, more and more broadcasters and retailers will also experiment with \"brandcasting\" - the term for advertisers becoming broadcasters - driven by the advent of new technology that allows for cross-media commercial avenues to be explored.

      "bodyText": "Twice in the last few days people have suggested to me that the Middle East is sliding towards war. One person saw it as no more than a possibility; the other as a near certainty. A typical scenario goes like this: with Israeli forces hard-pressed to combat the Palestinian uprising, Hizbullah guerrillas in southern Lebanon seize the opportunity to open up a second front across Israel's northern border. Israel responds by bombing Lebanon and Syria (since it holds the Syrians largely responsible for Hizbullah's actions). Saddam Hussein, who has been raring to have a go at Israel, then sends Iraqi troops to help the Syrians. The scenario sounds plausible if we accept the popular view of Hizbullah (\"The Party of God\") as a bunch of trigger-happy headbangers, but that is to misunderstand the nature of Hizbullah. It's a highly disciplined organisation with some sharp political thinkers at the top. Hizbullah certainly does not recognise Israel, which it regards as \"an illegitimate entity\", and would like it to disappear off the map. It also has rockets capable of striking deep into Israel - though that does not necessarily mean it intends to use them. While Hizbullah is convinced that Israel will eventually be defeated, it seems in no particular hurry. \"The Crusaders stayed in Palestine for 200 years and have gone. Israelis have only been in Palestine since 1948,\" the party's spokesman, Hussein Naboulsi, told me in Beirut last week. While anti-Israeli propaganda may be useful to mobilise the masses, the real focus of Hizbullah's attention is within Lebanon. The aim of its 18-year guerrilla struggle against the Israelis was to end the occupation of southern Lebanon - a goal finally achieved last May. Hizbullah still has a specific quarrel with the Israelis because their withdrawal did not include the tiny Sheba'a Farms area on the Lebanese-Syrian border. Israel says the area belongs to Syria, though both Syria and Lebanon say it is Lebanese. Last week, Mr Naboulsi he was not exactly breathing fire over that issue. \"Whenever we find a target in the Sheba'a Farms, we attack if it's easy to hit without casualties,\" he said. \"But it's very hard to launch an operation there.\" Hizbullah took the credit for forcing Israel's withdrawal from the south and, as a result, gained enormous prestige, not just among its core Shi'ite supporters, but throughout Lebanon. Since last year, most of its efforts have been devoted to capitalising on that and becoming a major force in Lebanese politics. To start another conflict now, or provoke the Israelis into starting one, could easily cost Hizbullah all the goodwill it has won. The Lebanese are still recovering from years of war and want nothing better than peace and stability. Hizbullah certainly recognises that and seems unlikely to do anything to jeopardise its position. Another reason some people predict war in the Middle East is the election of Ariel Sharon as Israeli prime minister. This arises mainly from European and American perceptions that Ehud Barak, the previous prime minister, was a man of peace, whereas Sharon is not. Arab perceptions, however, are very different. The general view is that there is little to distinguish between the two men, except that Sharon is likely to cause more problems for Israel than Barak did. In any case, Sharon's government is such a mish-mash of political elements that it is likely to stay in office only so long as it avoids doing anything controversial. Perversely, to western eyes, many Arabs see events since the start of the uprising last October in a positive light - a turning of the tide that has given the Palestinians a psychological advantage, if not a military one. One of the first effects was that Israel's painstaking efforts over many years to normalise its relations with moderate Arab states unravelled, almost overnight. Although Palestinian casualties far exceed those on the Israeli side, the number of Israeli Jews killed since the start of the intifada - at least 65 - is not insignificant. It is more than during the last year of the war in Lebanon, where casualties were considered unacceptably high. The increasing numbers of attacks within Israel's 1967 border are also likely to bring the conflict home to people in a way that the Lebanese war never did. Israelis may be prepared to tolerate this, along with the accompanying security measures, for a time - but only if they can see an end in sight: at present there is no sign of one. On the economic side, the full impact is still to be felt. Perceptions that Israel is a dangerous place to visit (it was recently classified as such by the US State Department) have begun to affect tourism and will eventually affect long-term investment. Added to all that, the country's political system now looks incapable of producing a long-lasting, stable government. Those Arabs who regard Israel's collapse as a historical inevitability - just like the departure of the Crusaders - hail this as the writing on the wall. Almost certainly it is not, but there is no doubt that Israel has got problems. Once demoralisation sets in, it could spread rapidly. That might force Israel into desperate measures, which could conceivably lead to war. More likely, it could shift Israeli opinion towards making the necessary compromises for peace.

      "bodyText": "Less than two months after George Bush's inauguration there are signs that the secretary of state, Colin Powell, is losing the struggle to shape key foreign and defence policies. Mr Powell seems out of step with his Pentagon and White House colleagues on a range of issues, including Korea, Kosovo, Iraq and European defence, raising the fear in foreign capitals that the Bush administration is not speaking with one voice on vital issues. The most visible example came last week when Mr Powell said that the Republican team intended to pick up the Clinton policy of cautious engagement with North Korea. He made a humiliating u-turn the next day after President Bush said that he had no intention of resuming talks with Pyongyang, to the dismay of South Korea's visiting president, Kim Dae-jung. Mr Powell appeared to be isolated again at the end of the week, this time on US peacekeeping in Kosovo. Two weeks ago in Brussels, He delighted Nato ministers with a declaration that the US and its allies had \"gone in together\" and would \"come out together\". But the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, conspicuously avoided any such pledge at a Washington press conference with the Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, on Thursday. On Iraq, Mr Powell clearly indicated that Washington supported the reformulation of the sanctions policy in favour of narrower \"smart\" sanctions on military-related imports. But that line was not echoed by his harder-line colleagues, including Mr Rumsfeld and Vice-President Dick Cheney. Mr Powell has also appeared readier than Mr Rumsfeld or Mr Cheney to welcome the European rapid-reaction defence force, even though Mr Bush himself appeared to side with Mr Powell during talks with Tony Blair at Camp David last month. Mr Powell suffered a severe defeat at the outset when he failed to have his ally Richard Armitage appointed deputy defence secretary under Mr Rumsfeld. Mr Bush appointed Paul Wolfowitz, a key Cheney ally who, along with Mr Rumsfeld, keenly supports the overthrow of Saddam Hussein: a stance Mr Powell opposes. Mr Powell also opposed one of Mr Bush's first foreign policy initiatives - the ban on US funding of international groups supporting abortion services. Senior British diplomatic sources say that it is too soon to pronounce Mr Powell the loser, but the split has become the focus of increasing attention in the US media. Last week the senior New York Times foreign affairs specialist Thomas Friedman said there was a battle between \"hard-nosed internationalists\" such as Mr Powell and \"ideologically driven hardliners\" such as Mr Rumsfeld and Mr Cheney. \"Which is Mr Bush's approach?\" Mr Friedman wrote. \"You have to wonder whether Mr Bush knows.\"",

      "byline": "John Patterson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I'm standing in line for 15 Minutes, the new thriller starring Robert De Niro and Edward Burns, when the guy in front of me looks at his change and says to the teenager at the box office: \"Eight bucks for 15 Minutes? Is this a movie-house or a whorehouse?\" </p> <p>And that was pretty much the best thing about the movie, one of those buddy-buddy thrillers that pass the time merrily enough while you're watching them, but disintegrate like soggy toilet paper in the time it takes to get from cinema to parking lot. Which is a pity, because 15 Minutes has ambitions - or perhaps they're just pretensions - to be something more substantial. </p> <p>The title comes from Warhol's overquoted aper\u00e7u about how in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. The media seduces everyone in the film, from De Niro's celebrity cop and Kelsey Grammer's tabloid-TV host to a couple of TV- obsessed villains, and nearly every character's face brightens noticeably when it looks like they might get to stand in front of a camera. </p> <p>De Niro is a grizzled old NYPD homicide cop who calls Grammer's sleazy show every time a telegenic bust is going down. Burns is a camera-shy arson investigator (with all the powers of a regular cop) who hooks up with De Niro to catch two arsonist killers from eastern Europe. They are not a pretty couple. One, Czech Emil, is a hair-trigger psychotic with messianic delusions of supercriminality, while the other, Russian Oleg, is a slow-witted media-obsessive who films every killing with his stolen digital video camera. </p> <p>As this pair leaves a trail of corpses and burnt-out buildings across Manhattan, the two cops match them step for step by combining their special knowledge of killers and conflagrations. </p> <p>The police-procedural material is shopworn and short on inspiration, so one has to look to the villains for originality. Emil is a garden-variety nutter who carves up everyone who crosses him, and constantly disparages his new homeland - which he only knows via \"cry-baby talkshows\" like Jerry Springer and Ricki Lake - with sarcastic tributes like: \"I love America! No one's responsible for what they do!\" (This is also the basis for his planned defence should he be apprehended.) Oleg, on the other hand, is a semi-retarded na\u00eff, a Frank Capra fan prone to rewinding the latest killing footage and saying things like: \"See? Iss more dramatic dis vay - like Silence off de Sheeps!\" </p> <p>Perhaps it's not surprising that their criminal partnership finally dissolves over creative differences and who gets final cut. Somehow one senses that these very same issues were to blame for 15 Minutes' narrative slackness and lack of focus. </p> <p>\"Slack\" and \"lack\" were two words that also flickered through my bored brain as I watched the Kennedy-era comedy Company Man, starring John Turturro and Sigourney Weaver - both looking totally stranded. We're well overdue for a comedy that skewers all the mythologising hero worship surrounding Jack'n'Jackie's Camelot and the CIA's involvement with the Cuban Missile Crisis. This isn't it, though. Oliver Stone's JFK was much, much funnier - even if that wasn't its intention - and so was Thirteen Days, at least when Kevin Costner was doing his Boston Brahmin accent. </p> <p>Which leaves us with my favourite movie in an admittedly weak week, the teen romantic comedy Get Over It. This stars Kirsten Dunst, who, ever since she played that nasty little bad-hair bloodsucker in Interview With a Vampire (aged all of 11) has been busy knocking out one winner after another. Either the girl's as smart as a whip or she has really good handlers, because Dick, The Virgin Suicides, Bring It On, Drop Dead Gorgeous and Small Soldiers all add up to a solid, well-chosen record for an actress who has yet to turn 19. </p> <p>Gussying up a teen-appeal story by basing it on an acknowledged literary classic has become quite a cottage industry over the past few years, and Get Over It is loosely derived from A Midsummer Night's Dream, centring on a school production of the play. </p> <p>Our hapless lead is Ben Foster, whose girlfriend dumps him for a gruesome British boy. In desperation, he tries out for the play, in which she and the Brit are starring, and gets a boost during his catastrophic audition from Dunst, his best friend's sister, who moons over him though he's too blind to realise. </p> <p>Martin Short makes the best impression as the teacher in charge of the production - Desmond Forest Oakes, a repressed gay smalltown failure aiming for the big league. Of the 12 songs he has written for the play, he says: \"Bill Shakespeare was a wonderful poet, but Burt Bacharach he was not!\" You half expect him to say: \"If Shakespeare were alive today, he'd be making high school romantic comedies!\" </p> <p>No, he wouldn't. But plenty of others are doing it for him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I'm standing in line for 15 Minutes, the new thriller starring Robert De Niro and Edward Burns, when the guy in front of me looks at his change and says to the teenager at the box office: \"Eight bucks for 15 Minutes? Is this a movie-house or a whorehouse?\" And that was pretty much the best thing about the movie, one of those buddy-buddy thrillers that pass the time merrily enough while you're watching them, but disintegrate like soggy toilet paper in the time it takes to get from cinema to parking lot. Which is a pity, because 15 Minutes has ambitions - or perhaps they're just pretensions - to be something more substantial. The title comes from Warhol's overquoted aper\u00e7u about how in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. The media seduces everyone in the film, from De Niro's celebrity cop and Kelsey Grammer's tabloid-TV host to a couple of TV- obsessed villains, and nearly every character's face brightens noticeably when it looks like they might get to stand in front of a camera. De Niro is a grizzled old NYPD homicide cop who calls Grammer's sleazy show every time a telegenic bust is going down. Burns is a camera-shy arson investigator (with all the powers of a regular cop) who hooks up with De Niro to catch two arsonist killers from eastern Europe. They are not a pretty couple. One, Czech Emil, is a hair-trigger psychotic with messianic delusions of supercriminality, while the other, Russian Oleg, is a slow-witted media-obsessive who films every killing with his stolen digital video camera. As this pair leaves a trail of corpses and burnt-out buildings across Manhattan, the two cops match them step for step by combining their special knowledge of killers and conflagrations. The police-procedural material is shopworn and short on inspiration, so one has to look to the villains for originality. Emil is a garden-variety nutter who carves up everyone who crosses him, and constantly disparages his new homeland - which he only knows via \"cry-baby talkshows\" like Jerry Springer and Ricki Lake - with sarcastic tributes like: \"I love America! No one's responsible for what they do!\" (This is also the basis for his planned defence should he be apprehended.) Oleg, on the other hand, is a semi-retarded na\u00eff, a Frank Capra fan prone to rewinding the latest killing footage and saying things like: \"See? Iss more dramatic dis vay - like Silence off de Sheeps!\" Perhaps it's not surprising that their criminal partnership finally dissolves over creative differences and who gets final cut. Somehow one senses that these very same issues were to blame for 15 Minutes' narrative slackness and lack of focus. \"Slack\" and \"lack\" were two words that also flickered through my bored brain as I watched the Kennedy-era comedy Company Man, starring John Turturro and Sigourney Weaver - both looking totally stranded. We're well overdue for a comedy that skewers all the mythologising hero worship surrounding Jack'n'Jackie's Camelot and the CIA's involvement with the Cuban Missile Crisis. This isn't it, though. Oliver Stone's JFK was much, much funnier - even if that wasn't its intention - and so was Thirteen Days, at least when Kevin Costner was doing his Boston Brahmin accent. Which leaves us with my favourite movie in an admittedly weak week, the teen romantic comedy Get Over It. This stars Kirsten Dunst, who, ever since she played that nasty little bad-hair bloodsucker in Interview With a Vampire (aged all of 11) has been busy knocking out one winner after another. Either the girl's as smart as a whip or she has really good handlers, because Dick, The Virgin Suicides, Bring It On, Drop Dead Gorgeous and Small Soldiers all add up to a solid, well-chosen record for an actress who has yet to turn 19. Gussying up a teen-appeal story by basing it on an acknowledged literary classic has become quite a cottage industry over the past few years, and Get Over It is loosely derived from A Midsummer Night's Dream, centring on a school production of the play. Our hapless lead is Ben Foster, whose girlfriend dumps him for a gruesome British boy. In desperation, he tries out for the play, in which she and the Brit are starring, and gets a boost during his catastrophic audition from Dunst, his best friend's sister, who moons over him though he's too blind to realise. Martin Short makes the best impression as the teacher in charge of the production - Desmond Forest Oakes, a repressed gay smalltown failure aiming for the big league. Of the 12 songs he has written for the play, he says: \"Bill Shakespeare was a wonderful poet, but Burt Bacharach he was not!\" You half expect him to say: \"If Shakespeare were alive today, he'd be making high school romantic comedies!\" No, he wouldn't. But plenty of others are doing it for him.",

And in a move that could outrage animal lovers, millions of viewers will follow the little animal right to his pet funeral in exactly a year's time. Viewers tuning into Channel 5 at 9pm tonight will witness the birth of a gerbil, which will form the cornerstone of Yahoo!'s sponsorship of the station's nightly movie slot. Over the 12-month period, the sponsorship either side of the movies will follow the life of the yet-to-be-named gerbil. Gerbils only live for a year and insiders at Channel 5 reckon they may even capture the animal's death live on TV. \"It would only be proper that we follow his full lifespan,\" said one executive at the station. Viewers will be asked to name the gerbil in a public vote being run on the Yahoo! website. And once the sponsorship deal kicks in, the life and times of the gerbil will be webcast live through Yahoo! 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The animal-friendly folk at Yahoo! are also planning to launch a campaign to find a partner for the wee rodent. The gerbil campaign, developed by HHCL and Partners, will run alongside movies such as Armageddon, Lethal Weapon 4, Mercury Rising and The Avengers. \"This is an exciting campaign for us, because no two idents will be the same,\" said Michael Sugden, account director at HHCL.

      "trailText": "<p>Ex-adman Stephen Carter, new head of the British arm of cable company NTL, has a mammoth task - restoring customer confidence and generating profits. He tells  David Teather how he intends to go about it.</p>",
      "byline": "David Teather",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After 15 years of working in advertising, Stephen Carter had, in his own words, started to \"recycle my own bullshit\". At 36, the man who joined J Walter Thompson as a graduate trainee and rose to chief executive decided in the latter part of last year that it was time to move on. He came close to accepting the still vacant top job at the ITV network but then took a call in the back of a car in the US from NTL chief executive Barclay Knapp. This time, he was persuaded to take the leap and in doing so accepted a job where any whiff of bullshit will be hard to miss. </p> <p>Carter, who became managing director of the cable operator's UK and Ireland business four months ago, has joined the company at a crucial time. After a frenetic period of acquisition and expansion, of digging roads and laying cable and most of all of promise after promise, NTL is at the stage where it needs to begin performing. Carter will be judged by the empirical evidence of revenues per subscriber, the success of the digital roll-out and customer numbers. NTL is, in the words of Knapp last week, \"getting down to business.\" </p> <p>NTL's excuses for letting BSkyB steal such a significant march, particularly in the roll-out of digital TV, have been valid enough. While Sky was powering ahead last year, much of NTL's time was spent in getting to grips with regulators and then the logistics of untangling the Cable &amp; Wireless Communications business from its parent and merging it with its existing network. </p> <p>But in doing so, it doubled in size and gained metropolitan networks in London, Manchester and Leeds. In effect, it became a national company, despite the small matter of Telewest - a legacy of the last government's decision to offer cable companies only small franchises, which has hampered the development of cable. It has been, Carter says, \"a seismic year\" for NTL. </p> <p>The company now finds itself in a position where it is able to compete more effectively with Sky and British Telecom for consumer and business accounts, and to reap the economic benefits of scale. NTL has also built debts of $15bn, which are due to peak at $20bn, and investors will be watching its promises of being cash flow-positive by 2003. It lost $3bn last year and can't afford any slippage on the targets for revenue growth. </p> <p>Carter is disarmingly frank about the failure of the cable industry to grapple with digital, which has proven to be the catalyst for the current burst of growth in pay TV. \"We were stuffed,\" he says. \"There is no doubt that when the history of cable is written, being late to market with digital will be judged as one of the things that held us back. But last year we launched three new products and bought a company the same size as ourselves. </p> <p>\"Sky and ONdigital had a six-month window to get out there while we were focused on the machinations of regulation. There's no doubt a couple of googlies last year slightly knocked us off our stride. That's why 2001 will be so interesting because digital is coming off the conveyor belt, people like it and it's genuinely a bloody good product.\" </p> <p>After the delays of last year - not helped by a shortage of components in the company's set-top boxes - the group has finally begun to put its weight behind digital. It has 600,000 digital subscribers and has set a target for the end of the year of 1.25m. Carter believes the entire network will be using digital by the end of 2002. </p> <p>With the focus at last on operations instead of deal-making, cable has a significant opportunity to make its mark in broadband. The technical limitations on satellite and the debacle surrounding the \"unbundling of the local loop\" to make DSL widely available have put NTL and Telewest in a strong position. </p> <p>\"I reckon we have an 18-month window to really steal a march on everyone else in both the consumer and business telecoms area,\" Carter says. \"We want to realise the assets we have within the group. We can take BT on in broadband with product quality and we will price it aggressively.\" </p> <p>The company so far has only 12,800 broadband subscribers but is aiming for 100,000 by year end. The difference in revenues is significant. Analogue customers are paying an average \u00a336 a month, digital customers are paying \u00a342 and cable modem customers more like \u00a366. </p> <p>The other priority for Carter is a tighter control on costs in an organisation which has naturally become unwieldy - in the UK alone, NTL has made 11 acquisitions in the past 18 months. As well as the inevitable job losses, he has to wrestle with the merging of different cultures and systems which all have a knock-on effect on the cable industry's biggest failing, its reputation for execrable customer service. </p> <p>Alongside a profile marking his arrival in NTL's internal magazine, United, was a letters page which demonstrated that the company is anything but. \"What do you plan to do about call centres?\" asked a technician. \"Every customer I go to complains of not being able to get through to report a fault.\" Another commented that in the company's head office in Hook, Hampshire, \"there seems to be a vast sense of despair, doom and gloom\". </p> <p>Much of NTL's efforts this year will be focused on improving the service in London, where repeated changes of ownership from Videotron to CWC have grotesquely illustrated the cable industry's problems, and where penetration is as low as 25%. \"Whether we like it or not, reputations are made or broken there, so we have made the decision to invest 30% of our infrastructure expenditure in London this year,\" Carter says. </p> <p> One of his first moves was to rationalise all the company's content, including its football club stakes, British Eurosport and its shares in the ITN cable channel, Front Row and Universal movie channel, into a single division. He has also made it clear that NTL will not be trying to emulate Sky, or even Telewest, in content. The programming is there, he says, to leverage better deals with \"real\" content providers. </p> <p>From 1999 onwards, Carter worked as a consultant to NTL at JWT. The agency came up with the branding campaign \"technology tamed\", which has put NTL on the map for consumers, and his appointment was clearly viewed as an acknowledgment by the company that it needed a little marketing nous. </p> <p>\"The cable industry has had a reputation for pretty poor service and amateur marketing and by and large the companies have been run by technologists, engineers and financial executives. Now, any company needs those people but when you get to the position we have where you've got scale, you've got network, and you've got the best part of 4m customers, what you need is well designed products that are packaged in a way that people understand and want to buy, priced and promoted elegantly and effectively,\" he says. \"I want the company run by the product managers.\" </p> <p>Raised in Edinburgh and educated at the local comprehensive, Carter went on to study law at Aberdeen University. When he graduated in the early 1980s the career to go into was advertising just as it would be investment banking now, he says. The clear message is that he is a businessman rather than a stereotypical adman. Before taking over as chief executive at JWT he did a stint at Harvard. Nor, he insists, is it too much of a wrench to leave the excesses of a Soho agency for a large corporation.

      "bodyText": "After 15 years of working in advertising, Stephen Carter had, in his own words, started to \"recycle my own bullshit\". At 36, the man who joined J Walter Thompson as a graduate trainee and rose to chief executive decided in the latter part of last year that it was time to move on. He came close to accepting the still vacant top job at the ITV network but then took a call in the back of a car in the US from NTL chief executive Barclay Knapp. This time, he was persuaded to take the leap and in doing so accepted a job where any whiff of bullshit will be hard to miss. Carter, who became managing director of the cable operator's UK and Ireland business four months ago, has joined the company at a crucial time. After a frenetic period of acquisition and expansion, of digging roads and laying cable and most of all of promise after promise, NTL is at the stage where it needs to begin performing. Carter will be judged by the empirical evidence of revenues per subscriber, the success of the digital roll-out and customer numbers. NTL is, in the words of Knapp last week, \"getting down to business.\" NTL's excuses for letting BSkyB steal such a significant march, particularly in the roll-out of digital TV, have been valid enough. While Sky was powering ahead last year, much of NTL's time was spent in getting to grips with regulators and then the logistics of untangling the Cable &amp; Wireless Communications business from its parent and merging it with its existing network. But in doing so, it doubled in size and gained metropolitan networks in London, Manchester and Leeds. In effect, it became a national company, despite the small matter of Telewest - a legacy of the last government's decision to offer cable companies only small franchises, which has hampered the development of cable. It has been, Carter says, \"a seismic year\" for NTL. The company now finds itself in a position where it is able to compete more effectively with Sky and British Telecom for consumer and business accounts, and to reap the economic benefits of scale. NTL has also built debts of $15bn, which are due to peak at $20bn, and investors will be watching its promises of being cash flow-positive by 2003. It lost $3bn last year and can't afford any slippage on the targets for revenue growth. Carter is disarmingly frank about the failure of the cable industry to grapple with digital, which has proven to be the catalyst for the current burst of growth in pay TV. \"We were stuffed,\" he says. \"There is no doubt that when the history of cable is written, being late to market with digital will be judged as one of the things that held us back. But last year we launched three new products and bought a company the same size as ourselves. \"Sky and ONdigital had a six-month window to get out there while we were focused on the machinations of regulation. There's no doubt a couple of googlies last year slightly knocked us off our stride. That's why 2001 will be so interesting because digital is coming off the conveyor belt, people like it and it's genuinely a bloody good product.\" After the delays of last year - not helped by a shortage of components in the company's set-top boxes - the group has finally begun to put its weight behind digital. It has 600,000 digital subscribers and has set a target for the end of the year of 1.25m. Carter believes the entire network will be using digital by the end of 2002. With the focus at last on operations instead of deal-making, cable has a significant opportunity to make its mark in broadband. The technical limitations on satellite and the debacle surrounding the \"unbundling of the local loop\" to make DSL widely available have put NTL and Telewest in a strong position. \"I reckon we have an 18-month window to really steal a march on everyone else in both the consumer and business telecoms area,\" Carter says. \"We want to realise the assets we have within the group. We can take BT on in broadband with product quality and we will price it aggressively.\" The company so far has only 12,800 broadband subscribers but is aiming for 100,000 by year end. The difference in revenues is significant. Analogue customers are paying an average \u00a336 a month, digital customers are paying \u00a342 and cable modem customers more like \u00a366. The other priority for Carter is a tighter control on costs in an organisation which has naturally become unwieldy - in the UK alone, NTL has made 11 acquisitions in the past 18 months. As well as the inevitable job losses, he has to wrestle with the merging of different cultures and systems which all have a knock-on effect on the cable industry's biggest failing, its reputation for execrable customer service. Alongside a profile marking his arrival in NTL's internal magazine, United, was a letters page which demonstrated that the company is anything but. \"What do you plan to do about call centres?\" asked a technician. \"Every customer I go to complains of not being able to get through to report a fault.\" Another commented that in the company's head office in Hook, Hampshire, \"there seems to be a vast sense of despair, doom and gloom\". Much of NTL's efforts this year will be focused on improving the service in London, where repeated changes of ownership from Videotron to CWC have grotesquely illustrated the cable industry's problems, and where penetration is as low as 25%. \"Whether we like it or not, reputations are made or broken there, so we have made the decision to invest 30% of our infrastructure expenditure in London this year,\" Carter says. One of his first moves was to rationalise all the company's content, including its football club stakes, British Eurosport and its shares in the ITN cable channel, Front Row and Universal movie channel, into a single division. He has also made it clear that NTL will not be trying to emulate Sky, or even Telewest, in content. The programming is there, he says, to leverage better deals with \"real\" content providers. From 1999 onwards, Carter worked as a consultant to NTL at JWT. The agency came up with the branding campaign \"technology tamed\", which has put NTL on the map for consumers, and his appointment was clearly viewed as an acknowledgment by the company that it needed a little marketing nous. \"The cable industry has had a reputation for pretty poor service and amateur marketing and by and large the companies have been run by technologists, engineers and financial executives. Now, any company needs those people but when you get to the position we have where you've got scale, you've got network, and you've got the best part of 4m customers, what you need is well designed products that are packaged in a way that people understand and want to buy, priced and promoted elegantly and effectively,\" he says. \"I want the company run by the product managers.\" Raised in Edinburgh and educated at the local comprehensive, Carter went on to study law at Aberdeen University. When he graduated in the early 1980s the career to go into was advertising just as it would be investment banking now, he says. The clear message is that he is a businessman rather than a stereotypical adman. Before taking over as chief executive at JWT he did a stint at Harvard. Nor, he insists, is it too much of a wrench to leave the excesses of a Soho agency for a large corporation. Advertising, he notes, is not the playground it once was and industry has loosened up a bit. \"There are things peculiar to the cable industry, that's true, but there are a lot of things about running a company which are transferable and a lot of things about marketing products which are transferable,\" he says. His years spent in adland have clearly left their mark. He repeatedly draws parallels between NTL and other consumer brands. NTL should be like Tesco, he says, \"fantastically good\" at providing products supplied by others and ever-reliable. It should be like a gas supplier: with customer service so good that it is invisible. In a flourish, he describes moving from consultant to running a business as akin to walking through the looking glass. \"But it's fantastically empowering because you do get to do all those things you say should be done as a consultant.\" As he says, spotting that the cable industry has been plagued by poor customer service and ineffectual marketing is the easy bit. Now the hard work begins.",

      "bodyText": "Favourite websites? www.qeboys.da.ru It's a weird website about the school I went to in Barnet called Queen Elizabeth. The site is subtitled \"QE: The Truth\" and basically tells lots of funny stories about teachers at the school. Also I like totallyjewish.com, aside from the fact that my company was bought by them. I'm normally quoted as saying I hate them but recently I've started liking them. Ever been in a chatroom? It's not really me. It's like walking into a party that you're not invited to. I'm surprised at how addicted people become to chatrooms. Real life is far better than internet chat. Most recent technological faux pas? Sending text messages for my girlfriend to the wrong person. I've got her phone number in a memory thing and yet I consistently manage to text the wrong person. Last online purchase? I like buying things on the internet but I've not really splashed out on anything more exciting then the bog standard books and CDs. Most useful site? news.bbc.co.uk.which I visit at least five times a day. It has the most in-depth news on the internet and upholds a high standard of journalism. Least useful site? Probably useless.com, what else? Which site is least likely to succeed? The JC.com [the Jewish Chronicle site]. A lot of time and effort was put into this site but it lacks functionality and is so much worse than the offline version. I just can't see how it's going to make money without diminishing the sales of the newspaper. Time spent on the web? Too much. From 10am till 6pm every day at work and sometimes more time afterwards. Screensaver? The Ed Harcourt one from skipmusic.com. Most irritating thing about the web? People's misconceptions about it. People are scared to look at our site but when they do they see that we're just a search engine and we have a porn search engine in addition to all the other stuff that we do. A lot of people don't know what a search engine is and think that we are actually making porn. Do you bother with old media? Yes. I read newspapers and watch some television. The relationship between old and new media is really important. They have to work together, but people mistakenly think they've got to be separate. \u0095 18-year-old Benjamin Cohen is the founder and CEO of cyberbritain.com He appears in Trouble at the Top on BBC2 this Thursday.",

This august body, funded by the nation's broadcasters, is solely responsible for pre-vetting all commercials before they go on air in the UK.

They claim the watchdog has far too much power, that it stifles creativity and is too anal and humourless in its application of the ITC code. In adland BACC is the ultimate four-letter word. </p> <p>Only last week the latest furore blew up over yet another arguably dozy piece of decision-making. The brouhaha surrounded a new fcuk commercial for French Connection which depicted a young couple talking a bit dirty to each other while getting undressed. The BACC rejected it on the grounds that it contained \"an unacceptable level of sexual innuendo\", a judgment that prompted Trevor Beattie, who created it, to stage an impromptu press conference and even stick a statement in the window of the fashion chain's Oxford Circus branch, railing against the authorities. </p> <p>Beattie's antics aside, there are plenty more contentious examples of ads that have fallen under the BACC's knife. There was the drinks script that featured a group of young men running after a donkey. This was stopped \"because of its sexual overtones\". Another spot, for a supermarket special offer, was disallowed because it showed a cashpoint paying out more cash than the person ordered (deemed \"irresponsible\" because it suggested that banks didn't know how to distribute cash properly). </p> <p>There was also the recent jokey Cravendale milk ad that ran into trouble (although it eventually aired) for depicting a herd of cows as \"too menacing\", and the Tunes commercial barred from the screen for showing a woman deliberately trying to get a cold because she loved the cough sweets so much. This, too, was judged \"irresponsible\" because it \"encouraged the public to get ill\". </p> <p>Just who exactly are these people who think a Tunes ad will incite members of the public to infect themselves, and how are they qualified to be the ultimate arbiters of all taste and decency in our TV commercials? Put simply, should the BACC itself be banned? </p> <p>Uisdean Maclean is the body's director: \"Our remit is to ensure that all advertising abides by the ITC code on advertising standards. We are charged by the broadcasters to work on their behalf, to avoid offending the mass audience. We have to stick by this, regardless of whether people say we are living in the dark ages.\" </p> <p>Maclean is assisted in his grand task by 20 executives, ranging in age from 23 to 50, who represent a \"broad cross-section of society\". Some have a legal background, some come from broadcasting, and the rest are recruited from the Advertising Standards Authority (the BACC's print ad equivalent). </p> <p>Every script is first read by a small group of at least three executives. If there is anything vaguely contentious, it is then passed on to a daily meeting of several more senior people, including the director himself. </p> <p>\"If we can't reach a decision we refer it to a monthly BACC copy committee which includes several heavyweight representatives from the broadcasters,\" explains Maclean. </p> <p>It would seem, therefore, that there is a pretty robust system in place to guarantee against highly individual, subjective, irrational rulings - all the things, in fact, that the BACC is accused of. </p> <p>So where does it go wrong? For go wrong it does. Surely something is seriously awry if a committee of grown-ups stops a script advertising Ragu Chunky Vegetables because they think there is \"sexual innuendo\" in the product name. </p> <p>Tim Mellors, chief creative officer of Grey London, says: \"They are too literal. They err on the side of safety rather than reason. They are basically arse-coverers because if an ad goes on air and it gets taken off, they look silly.\" </p> <p>Dave Droga, executive creative director of Saatchi and Saatchi, goes further: \"They pander to a very small minority of vocal people who complain about everything. It is actually damaging our advertising. We are very shackled - the world has moved on, programming has moved on, the consumer has moved on, but advertising stays the same.\" </p> <p>Maclean nobly admits that the BACC has \"made mistakes\", and that in those rare instances it has simply admitted that it misjudged a situation. On balance, however, he insists that the body acts in a responsible, unhysterical way. </p> <p>\"We don't just think about any potential complaint from anywhere - we think about whether it could be justified. We want the advertising on air, but we want it to stay on air. If an ad is suspended then it is tears all round.\" </p> <p>But what about the particular charges, that the BACC cramps creativity, lacks any sense of humour, and, most common of all, that it is inconsistent? </p> <p>\"I would look at any criticism and decide whether there was any justification, but we try to be as consistent as possible - a lot depends on the context in which the scenes are shown. And I would not agree at all that we stifle creativity. In fact it has often been said that we stimulate creativity to get round the problems.\" </p> <p>It would certainly appear that the BACC has a thankless task. If an ad is broadcast without controversy, it gets no praise, and if it is banned by the ITC, it is blamed. The pre-vetting agency is often, in fact, the first line of defence if an ad is taken off - agencies say \"but the BACC okayed it\". </p> <p>However, a few adfolk do have some sympathy for the TV watchdog and the job it is charged with. \"I feel sorry for them. They are under an avalanche of scripts, they are undermanned and underfunded. The number of scripts has quadrupled - they are hideously overworked and so are not working in the best way,\" says Robert Campbell, creative director of Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe/Y&amp;R. </p> <p>Mellors believes things could be worse: \"The BACC is voluntary so it is not as awful as a governmental department would be. They are recruited from the business so they largely understand the issues. There has to be some kind of watchdog and it is better that it is from within the industry than outside it.\" </p> <p>The verdict, then, would appear to be that the BACC should not be banned, it should simply be given more money and more experienced staff. Plus it should get out a bit more. In this age of deregulated TV programming, in which, as Beattie said, \"murder, pillage, cannibalism and mediocrity routinely passes for family entertainment\", those in control of the nation's commercials should relax a little.</p>",

Another spot, for a supermarket special offer, was disallowed because it showed a cashpoint paying out more cash than the person ordered (deemed \"irresponsible\" because it suggested that banks didn't know how to distribute cash properly). There was also the recent jokey Cravendale milk ad that ran into trouble (although it eventually aired) for depicting a herd of cows as \"too menacing\", and the Tunes commercial barred from the screen for showing a woman deliberately trying to get a cold because she loved the cough sweets so much. This, too, was judged \"irresponsible\" because it \"encouraged the public to get ill\". Just who exactly are these people who think a Tunes ad will incite members of the public to infect themselves, and how are they qualified to be the ultimate arbiters of all taste and decency in our TV commercials? Put simply, should the BACC itself be banned? Uisdean Maclean is the body's director: \"Our remit is to ensure that all advertising abides by the ITC code on advertising standards. We are charged by the broadcasters to work on their behalf, to avoid offending the mass audience. We have to stick by this, regardless of whether people say we are living in the dark ages.\" Maclean is assisted in his grand task by 20 executives, ranging in age from 23 to 50, who represent a \"broad cross-section of society\". Some have a legal background, some come from broadcasting, and the rest are recruited from the Advertising Standards Authority (the BACC's print ad equivalent). Every script is first read by a small group of at least three executives. If there is anything vaguely contentious, it is then passed on to a daily meeting of several more senior people, including the director himself. \"If we can't reach a decision we refer it to a monthly BACC copy committee which includes several heavyweight representatives from the broadcasters,\" explains Maclean. It would seem, therefore, that there is a pretty robust system in place to guarantee against highly individual, subjective, irrational rulings - all the things, in fact, that the BACC is accused of. So where does it go wrong? For go wrong it does. Surely something is seriously awry if a committee of grown-ups stops a script advertising Ragu Chunky Vegetables because they think there is \"sexual innuendo\" in the product name. Tim Mellors, chief creative officer of Grey London, says: \"They are too literal. They err on the side of safety rather than reason. They are basically arse-coverers because if an ad goes on air and it gets taken off, they look silly.\" Dave Droga, executive creative director of Saatchi and Saatchi, goes further: \"They pander to a very small minority of vocal people who complain about everything. It is actually damaging our advertising. We are very shackled - the world has moved on, programming has moved on, the consumer has moved on, but advertising stays the same.\" Maclean nobly admits that the BACC has \"made mistakes\", and that in those rare instances it has simply admitted that it misjudged a situation. On balance, however, he insists that the body acts in a responsible, unhysterical way. \"We don't just think about any potential complaint from anywhere - we think about whether it could be justified. We want the advertising on air, but we want it to stay on air. If an ad is suspended then it is tears all round.\" But what about the particular charges, that the BACC cramps creativity, lacks any sense of humour, and, most common of all, that it is inconsistent? \"I would look at any criticism and decide whether there was any justification, but we try to be as consistent as possible - a lot depends on the context in which the scenes are shown. And I would not agree at all that we stifle creativity. In fact it has often been said that we stimulate creativity to get round the problems.\" It would certainly appear that the BACC has a thankless task. If an ad is broadcast without controversy, it gets no praise, and if it is banned by the ITC, it is blamed. The pre-vetting agency is often, in fact, the first line of defence if an ad is taken off - agencies say \"but the BACC okayed it\". However, a few adfolk do have some sympathy for the TV watchdog and the job it is charged with. \"I feel sorry for them. They are under an avalanche of scripts, they are undermanned and underfunded. The number of scripts has quadrupled - they are hideously overworked and so are not working in the best way,\" says Robert Campbell, creative director of Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe/Y&amp;R. Mellors believes things could be worse: \"The BACC is voluntary so it is not as awful as a governmental department would be. They are recruited from the business so they largely understand the issues. There has to be some kind of watchdog and it is better that it is from within the industry than outside it.\" The verdict, then, would appear to be that the BACC should not be banned, it should simply be given more money and more experienced staff. Plus it should get out a bit more. In this age of deregulated TV programming, in which, as Beattie said, \"murder, pillage, cannibalism and mediocrity routinely passes for family entertainment\", those in control of the nation's commercials should relax a little.",

Lucian Camp, chairman of CCHM, the direct marketing agency for St James Place, Barclays, Axa and Zurich Financial Services, says a \"relationship\" with a customer is now about cross-selling. \"The man from the Pru didn't want to flog ISAs, he genuinely maintained a kind of customer relationship that is now finished, except for the rich.\" Internet banks, such as Prudential's Egg and the Co-op's Smile, have built new financial brands without any face-to-face customer contact. But it didn't stop Smile launching its brand based entirely on a warm, friendly personality and Egg presenting itself as a cuddly partner in the \"k-i-s-s-i-n-g in a tree\" ads. Nigel Long, chief executive of Partners BDDH, the ad agency which launched Smile, says: \"We tried to give a mood and spirit to the bank, not just a set of facts and products.\" It is straight out of the Orange book of brand building. The mobile phone brand's sunny personality and scant regard for boring details revolutionised marketing. But established financial service providers, saddled with decades of tradition, will have to struggle to maintain the human touch.",

      "body": "<p>Elites are never smashed, only replaced. The Groucho Club, formed to break the cosy establishment coterie of St James, appears in no mood to have its own hard-won position challenged by a vulgar upstart. </p> <p>Benjamin Fry, whose detractors like to paint him as a fully paid-up member of the Fulham Sloane set, had Groucho members clutching their gins in fear with a well-timed bid to take over the dusty Soho drinking den. Just as the place looked as if it could do with a fresh pair of hands on the optics, along came the old Etonian with a plan to open a chain of Groucho hotels from here to Los Angeles. </p> <p>It was as if the fires of hell were about to descend upon Dean Street. Dick Bradsell, London's foremost cocktail mixologist and a long-term Groucho member, spoke for all when the first Fry bid was filed last year: \"Benji Fry is the kind of person who would make an excellent dinner for Groucho members. I hate him already.\" </p> <p>Just as well, then, that the Groucho should be saved from this ignominy by one of the leading members of the new elite: PR guru and socialite Matthew Freud. As soon as Fry's interest became apparent last year, he put himself forward as a white knight. Nine months of negotiations have just been completed, and a \u00a312m offer is being finalised. It will almost certainly be recommended by the Groucho board, and is equally certain to be accepted. The Groucho shareholders - the 350 publishers, writers and assorted glitterati who wrote out cheques to Tony Mackintosh for \u00a31,500 or so in 1984 - are a loyal bunch. If Tony says sell to Matthew, the chances are they probably will. </p> <p>\"It's not even Coke versus Pepsi, it's Coke versus a Soda Stream,\" says one Freud-supporting source with knowledge of the deal. </p> <p>Normally, such a catfight over a faintly tatty members' club would barely merit a couple of paragraphs in a society journal, far less national newspaper interest. Yet it is the Groucho members' list that excites: 3,984 of the hottest names in the media, music and the arts. From Nigella Lawson to Lord Archer via Julie Burchill and Keith Allen, since 1984 the Groucho has catered for the irrepressible desire of media folk to mingle, flirt, gossip, deal, booze, and (sometimes) eat. It usurped the grubby Fleet Street pubs that used to provide after-hours shelter to hacks - and made a chattering class feel a bit more exclusive than it really deserves. </p> <p>\"Our whole basis was to try and develop a place that was open, equal to men and women, and that had no family or corporate membership, somewhere where members would be treated as individuals,\" says Mackintosh, who is now 63. \"It was for people working in the media - that we were to offer the same facilities and courtesies that you got from traditional clubs but in a contemporary setting in terms of rules, services, atmosphere and design, and that is what we have tried to do over the past 16 years.\" </p> <p>But the membership list remained exclusive: many applications are unsuccessful. Those who are accepted must wait months before they can take up the membership benefits: it would not do to overcrowd the place. The name, of course, comes from Groucho Marx's line: \"I don't care to belong to any club that would accept me as a member.\" </p> <p>The current Groucho crowd is wary that a bottom line-obsessed new breed would ruin the magic. But Fry says that the Groucho management are stuck in the past, and warns that it will head straight for the bankruptcy courts if it continues to be managed in the way it is. He wants to merge the Groucho into his Zoo hotel group, which has sent the Groucho set apoplectic. </p> <p>Hence the interest in the Freud deal, which teams the PR man with Joel Cadbury, a bar and restaurant entrepreneur from the chocolate dynasty, and Rupert Hambro, who hails from the City merchant banking family. Their approach will not set the Groucho members' teeth on edge. Little has been said so far of the Freud plans, but Media Guardian understands that they are based on a cautious extension of the Groucho brand - and certainly no major changes to the club itself. \"They've got no intention of turning the Groucho into Virgin,\" says one club member who knows of Freud's plans. </p> <p>It is likely that the Freud management would seek to emulate the success of its younger rival Soho House, which under founder Nick Jones has also launched a country offshoot, Babington House. It is also possible that Groucho products - such as the highly regarded house wine - could be made more widely available to non-members (but only in certain hand-picked restaurants, or perhaps by order, of course). </p> <p>While the Groucho lot liked to paint themselves as anti-establish ment, they are a pretty conservative bunch at heart, and the Freud deal is far more attractive. It helps that Freud is a member; and it helps even more that his bid is in cash. (Fry is offering to swap one Groucho share for two or three Zoo shares.) </p> <p>For the moment, Mackintosh is careful not to prejudice the due diligence process (the Groucho is listed on the Ofex small business stock exchange), but it is clear where his preferance lies. \"One offer has got paper with the Queen's head on it; the other has Zoo Hotel's logo on it.\" But one thing is certain: the Groucho will be sold. While Mackintosh insists there is still \"fire in his belly\", he acknowledges it is time to give someone younger a go. </p> <p>Mackintosh is revered among the membership, but many would agree with him. Times have changed: as with all successful ventures, it has spawned imitators that have overtaken it. Venues such as Soho House and Black's, both within vomiting distance of the Groucho, have attracted a younger and trendier crowd, and cater better to their changing tastes. </p> <p>Soho House, in particular, has succeeded in getting the e-kids though the door in a way that the Groucho never attempted. The Groucho - where Private Eye founder Richard Ingrams famously courted the waitress and his now live-in companion Deborah Bosely - has its feet and heart firmly in the 1980s. </p> <p>The two clubs' members are two tribes, divided largely (though not exclusively) by age and media speciality. The Groucho set tends to be drawn from journalism, publishing and television; and consists of established, if not establishment figures. They include Simon Kelner, editor of the Independent, Nick Clarke, presenter of The World at One (\"I only go there for lunch, and not that often.\"). This is where Angus Deayton and Nigella Lawson recently held a joint 40th birthday party. It is where Sarah Helm, accompanied by her partner Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's chief of staff, chooses to dine. And it is where the founders of Women in Journalism go for their annual lunch. Soho House is younger in spirit and appeals to the newer advertising, film and internet set. </p> <p>The divide is neatly illustrated by two contrasting launches. Lord Bragg, old school, introduced the latest series of the South Bank Show last autumn in a rather cramped room at the Groucho; last week, David Liddiment, ITV's director of programmes and most certainly a \"new ITV\" man, showed off a historical documentary series, Time of our Lives, at Soho House's private cinema. </p> <p>David Docherty, head of broadband content at Flextech/Telewest, launched his novel at Soho House last year, as Alan Yentob and Jane Root looked on. But Dianne Thompson, chief executive of Camelot, opted for Groucho's for a packed farewell party last month for Louise White, the outgoing director of communications. Camelot chairman Sir George Russell felt far more at home in the louche glamour of the Groucho than the rather less subtle stylishness of Soho House. </p> <p>\"I prefer the Groucho Club but that's an age thing partly,\" says Victor Sebestyen, an Evening Standard writer who belongs to both. </p> <p>Anne Spackman, now a property writer for The Financial Times, and Guardian journalist Charles Burgess held a huge wedding reception at the Groucho in September 1987, when it was still young. Many journalist guests had to be given instructions on how to find the club. </p> <p>\"We could hire the whole place for \u00a3500, because, believe it or not, it didn't open then on Saturdays,\" Spackman says. \"We had dancing in the back room downstairs, now the dining room, and another room where children could just grind their crisps into the carpet. It just seemed more appropriate to be there than a City livery company. Whenever I occasionally go there now, it seems very much smarter.\" </p> <p>There is a sense, however, that the Groucho has somehow lost its way. Philip Kerr, novelist and screenwriter, says: \"It is so changed from the 1990s, when it seemed full of fun people, lots of hacks you knew. I find it a ghost of its former self.\" </p> <p>Freud intends gently to reinvigorate the Groucho. But as the club crowd grows old, he may find a new danger: that the whole members' club scene is on the wane. One 30-year-old new media professional has shunned both. \"Soho House is too camp, young and attitude-ridden. The Groucho is dusty enough to have some more interesting characters. But I have actively chosen not to be a member of either. Why would I want to buy into a mass-market 'elitist club', full of precisely the kind of people who you would join a club to avoid? There are many better places to go when you have friends, rather than places to go to try and make contacts.

      "byline": "Sean Dodson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Rachel Newsome is sitting in a quiet pub in east London, sipping cappuccino and insisting that she is no rebel. The 28-year-old bottle-blonde who won the Guardian's Student Media Award and then dropped out of journalism school after one term has just been appointed editor of the glossy style bible, Dazed &amp; Confused. She's no rebel, she says, because, frankly, no one knows what the word means anymore. </p> <p>Newsome's first issue in charge -out this Thursday - will focus on the nature of youth rebellion. Tagged \"Rebellion is dead: long live rebellion,\" the April edition is, she says, no less than a call-to-arms to British teenagers. It's time to wise up, stop taking so many drugs, work out what you believe in and get political. </p> <p>Born in Teesside, but raised in south Manchester, Newsome describes herself as a \"posh northerner\". She cut her teeth at Sheffield University, editing the student paper's first women's section, for which she won the Guardian award. After a \"disastrous\" term on the University of Cardiff's postgraduate diploma course, Newsome returned to Manchester, where she worked for Jockey Slut and Muzik magazines. It was three and a half years ago when she joined Dazed &amp; Confused and, after a lengthy period as deputy, she finally inherited the editor's chair last month. </p> <p>Dazed &amp; Confused was established in 1991 by Rankin Waddell, Jefferson Hack and Ian Taylor, who were all then still studying at the London College of Printing. Initially the magazine was free, and operated an open-access policy with contributors often working for nothing. It quickly gained a reputation as an irreverent title with visual flair that refused to pander to what Hack calls the \"empty egos of the rich and famous\". Today, Dazed sells 48,000 copies in the UK and 18,000 overseas. </p> <p>Next month's Rebellion edition is \"very much a manifesto for where I want to take the direction of the magazine,\" says Newsome. \"It's about understanding that our world is saturated with this idea of lifestyle culture, but at the same time asking: 'If all that is important is the good life, then where do we work out our values, where do we work out what we believe in?'\" </p> <p>The Rebellion edition is the first in a series of themed issues that Newsome claims will help to establish the magazine's own agenda. This, she hopes, will lead to \"a way of us turning the whole marketing system around. So instead of waiting to see who has got a record or film coming out, it is about us exploring things that we are interested in. We don't want to just reflect back the latest pop phenomenon.\" </p> <p>This, she says, is not being addressed by any of her rivals. Their old agenda of trend-spotting is becoming increasingly redundant, she says. \"There is no such thing as an underground anymore, because corporate culture has infiltrated and co-opted youth culture.\" </p> <p>Last month a report by the European School Survey Project claimed that British teenagers are more likely than their continental counterparts to take drugs, drink alcohol or smoke. For Newsome, this means that drug-taking - once perceived as a radical gesture - has become nothing more than consumer conformity. Thursday's issue simply wants to ask, where does British youth go from here? </p> <p>\"We are living in an economic boom time,\" says Newsome. \"People have more money than ever before, we spend more on going out, more on drinking, more on all sorts of illegal things. But we're reaching a point where that's coming apart. At the same time, there are deeper cultural trends in terms of rising numbers of depression cases, and reports coming out detailing escalating numbers of male suicides at university.\" </p> <p>Newsome's mantra seems to be that you can't look at culture without looking at society. Her plan is to develop the social consciousness of the magazine, to the point where the writing in Dazed wins as many plaudits as its photography. Newsome is coy when asked for specific details, saying only that investigative and social reportage are high on the agenda. </p> <p>\"I think we've reached saturation point, where the party's almost over. Our generation have got what we wanted. There are more opportunities for young people to set up their own label or start their own club. People travel more than ever before, but I think people are still looking for something to believe in.\" </p> <p>Youth culture is no longer underground, she says. \"It's not an elite thing, it's penetrated our whole society. But there is also a reemergence of interest in having a global vision, especially through the anti-capitalism movement. Now it's a question of what we do next? Do we just carry on partying with our eyes closed or do we use our clout to enforce change?\" </p> <p>Last year Dazed instigated a campaign with Jubilee 2000 - the pressure group calling for an end to third world debt. The collaboration was syndicated to 17 magazines throughout the world, including Colors, Nylon and Papers in New York. </p> <p>\"The whole landscape of style magazines has changed since the Face and I-D started 20 years ago,\" explains Newsome. \"Then, nobody else understood the relationship between street fashion, style and music. Whereas now, every Sunday supplement has its own style section, you can read music reviews in the Guardian and get club listings in the Evening Standard and the Sun. So what are we getting from style magazines that we cannot get elsewhere?\" </p> <p>But if tabloid newspapers are wearing the style mags' clothes where does that leave a magazine like Dazed &amp; Confused? </p> <p>\"It's really interesting if you look at the amount of column space given to Eminem by well-respected, broadsheet columnists,\" she says. \"But they completely misunderstand Eminem and the culture he is coming from and what he represents. It's embarrassing, misinformed and not saying anything that is relevant.\" </p> <p>The new issue also features an article about straight edges - the no-drugs, no-alcohol punk scene that is gaining a small but significant foothold among Britain's youth. \"Although they are very small, that's the extreme that will eventually filter down into people's attitudes,\" she says. </p> <p>Beyond that Dazed will this autumn launch two new titles. The first is a car magazine, Refuel, that will \"look at car culture in the way that Wallpaper looks at interiors\". The car mag will be followed by the launch of a stand-alone fashion magazine. </p> <p>But for now there is the new direction to worry about. Although it is significant that a magazine such as Dazed &amp; Confused is even questioning the nature of rebellion, Newsome insists that Dazed isn't about to denounce the level of decadence we've seen in the past 20 years. For her, hedonism and ideology can co-exist. It's a question of balance, she says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Newsome is sitting in a quiet pub in east London, sipping cappuccino and insisting that she is no rebel. The 28-year-old bottle-blonde who won the Guardian's Student Media Award and then dropped out of journalism school after one term has just been appointed editor of the glossy style bible, Dazed &amp; Confused. She's no rebel, she says, because, frankly, no one knows what the word means anymore. Newsome's first issue in charge -out this Thursday - will focus on the nature of youth rebellion. Tagged \"Rebellion is dead: long live rebellion,\" the April edition is, she says, no less than a call-to-arms to British teenagers. It's time to wise up, stop taking so many drugs, work out what you believe in and get political. Born in Teesside, but raised in south Manchester, Newsome describes herself as a \"posh northerner\". She cut her teeth at Sheffield University, editing the student paper's first women's section, for which she won the Guardian award. After a \"disastrous\" term on the University of Cardiff's postgraduate diploma course, Newsome returned to Manchester, where she worked for Jockey Slut and Muzik magazines. It was three and a half years ago when she joined Dazed &amp; Confused and, after a lengthy period as deputy, she finally inherited the editor's chair last month. Dazed &amp; Confused was established in 1991 by Rankin Waddell, Jefferson Hack and Ian Taylor, who were all then still studying at the London College of Printing. Initially the magazine was free, and operated an open-access policy with contributors often working for nothing. It quickly gained a reputation as an irreverent title with visual flair that refused to pander to what Hack calls the \"empty egos of the rich and famous\". Today, Dazed sells 48,000 copies in the UK and 18,000 overseas. Next month's Rebellion edition is \"very much a manifesto for where I want to take the direction of the magazine,\" says Newsome. \"It's about understanding that our world is saturated with this idea of lifestyle culture, but at the same time asking: 'If all that is important is the good life, then where do we work out our values, where do we work out what we believe in?'\" The Rebellion edition is the first in a series of themed issues that Newsome claims will help to establish the magazine's own agenda. This, she hopes, will lead to \"a way of us turning the whole marketing system around. So instead of waiting to see who has got a record or film coming out, it is about us exploring things that we are interested in. We don't want to just reflect back the latest pop phenomenon.\" This, she says, is not being addressed by any of her rivals. Their old agenda of trend-spotting is becoming increasingly redundant, she says. \"There is no such thing as an underground anymore, because corporate culture has infiltrated and co-opted youth culture.\" Last month a report by the European School Survey Project claimed that British teenagers are more likely than their continental counterparts to take drugs, drink alcohol or smoke. For Newsome, this means that drug-taking - once perceived as a radical gesture - has become nothing more than consumer conformity. Thursday's issue simply wants to ask, where does British youth go from here? \"We are living in an economic boom time,\" says Newsome. \"People have more money than ever before, we spend more on going out, more on drinking, more on all sorts of illegal things. But we're reaching a point where that's coming apart. At the same time, there are deeper cultural trends in terms of rising numbers of depression cases, and reports coming out detailing escalating numbers of male suicides at university.\" Newsome's mantra seems to be that you can't look at culture without looking at society. Her plan is to develop the social consciousness of the magazine, to the point where the writing in Dazed wins as many plaudits as its photography. Newsome is coy when asked for specific details, saying only that investigative and social reportage are high on the agenda. \"I think we've reached saturation point, where the party's almost over. Our generation have got what we wanted. There are more opportunities for young people to set up their own label or start their own club. People travel more than ever before, but I think people are still looking for something to believe in.\" Youth culture is no longer underground, she says. \"It's not an elite thing, it's penetrated our whole society. But there is also a reemergence of interest in having a global vision, especially through the anti-capitalism movement. Now it's a question of what we do next? Do we just carry on partying with our eyes closed or do we use our clout to enforce change?\" Last year Dazed instigated a campaign with Jubilee 2000 - the pressure group calling for an end to third world debt. The collaboration was syndicated to 17 magazines throughout the world, including Colors, Nylon and Papers in New York. \"The whole landscape of style magazines has changed since the Face and I-D started 20 years ago,\" explains Newsome. \"Then, nobody else understood the relationship between street fashion, style and music. Whereas now, every Sunday supplement has its own style section, you can read music reviews in the Guardian and get club listings in the Evening Standard and the Sun. So what are we getting from style magazines that we cannot get elsewhere?\" But if tabloid newspapers are wearing the style mags' clothes where does that leave a magazine like Dazed &amp; Confused? \"It's really interesting if you look at the amount of column space given to Eminem by well-respected, broadsheet columnists,\" she says. \"But they completely misunderstand Eminem and the culture he is coming from and what he represents. It's embarrassing, misinformed and not saying anything that is relevant.\" The new issue also features an article about straight edges - the no-drugs, no-alcohol punk scene that is gaining a small but significant foothold among Britain's youth. \"Although they are very small, that's the extreme that will eventually filter down into people's attitudes,\" she says. Beyond that Dazed will this autumn launch two new titles. The first is a car magazine, Refuel, that will \"look at car culture in the way that Wallpaper looks at interiors\". The car mag will be followed by the launch of a stand-alone fashion magazine. But for now there is the new direction to worry about. Although it is significant that a magazine such as Dazed &amp; Confused is even questioning the nature of rebellion, Newsome insists that Dazed isn't about to denounce the level of decadence we've seen in the past 20 years. For her, hedonism and ideology can co-exist. It's a question of balance, she says.",

      "bodyText": "German media group Kirch's plans to auction off the World Cup broadcasting rights are in chaos as potential bidders boycott the process. Kirch has sparked fury in the UK over plans to sell the franchise for the 2002 tournament to the highest bidder, which could see the BBC and ITV lose out to a pay-TV predator. But sources close to pay-TV companies including BSkyB, ONdigital and U&gt;Direct said they would not break UK broadcasting laws. The rules, which are hotly disputed by Kirch, state that free-to-air broadcasters must have access to the entire World Cup. \"If the tournament has to go to a free-to-air broadcaster then it is not worth a pay-TV service bidding for it. I would be surprised if we get involved,\" said one source. Another source said that taking part in an auction was out of the question. \"It would be illegal for Kirch to sell the rights to us, so the matter of an auction does not arise,\" said the source. Kirch put its case for an auction to officials at the department of culture, media and sports last week, but it is increasingly likely the German group will have to resume stalled negotiations with the BBC and ITV. The group threw out the consortium's bid of around \u00a340m several weeks ago and told BBC and ITV representatives it would start an auction, but sources close to the UK broadcasters say nothing has happened since. \"We are still awaiting information from Kirch about their planned auction of the rights,\" said one source. BBC and ITV insiders hope Kirch will be forced into a compromise similar to the one it reached with German public broadcasters last week, who paid an undisclosed sum for the rights following the intervention of chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Although Kirch has lodged a complaint with the European Court of Justice over the UK broadcasting laws, its plans for an auction are likely to buckle under government pressure and a pay-TV boycott.

      "bodyText": "ITV is staring into an advertising abyss after analysts effectively wrote off its chances of recovering from a slump in the market this year. Neil Blackley, the influential media analyst at Merrill Lynch who first highlighted the weakness of ITV advertising revenues last year, today said the advertising downturn \"is far worse than expected.\" The Merrill team estimated in a note that advertising revenues for May and June could fall by 13% and 16% respectively, which would make a recovery impossible in the second half of the year. Even if revenues pick up in between July and December, advertising is expected to fall by 1% compared to last year. It is bad news for ITV giants Granada and Carlton Communications, which have been hit by the collapsing advertising spend of dotcom start-ups and the fall in meat advertising due to the foot nad mouth crisis. The Merrill team added that \"it is now inevitable that ITV will go on satellite before the end of the year.\" Granada and Carlton's shares were barely affected by the news, as it has been widely predicted that the ITV advertising recession would last all year.",

We've got Ted Heath; they've got Strom. Surely Thurmond is the weird exception, not the rule? Surely he has no part in the world which Tony and Gordon and George all share?</p> <p>Thurmond's final election in 1996 came when Bob Dole ran for president. Dole was young enough to be Thurmond's son. Thurmond far out-paced Dole in South Carolina. He won 51% of women voters, 20% of black voters (as opposed to Dole's 10%) and 20% of those who said they were Democrats. No fluke. At 94, too crocked to campaign much, too tired for anything beyond televi sion commercials, he was still a force. His pork barrel was never empty.</p> <p>If Strom Thurmond, on his record, ran in Austria, Brussels would frown. If he ran in Germany or Italy, the Daily Mail might be moved to wrath.

      "body": "<p>The career of the American jazz dancer and acrobat, Joe Chisholm, who has died of cancer aged 75, began in 40s Harlem, took in many of the great swing bands, and flourished in Britain in the late 60s and 70s. Chisholm could bring an audience to him through jokes, impossibly fast cane moves, and elegant tap dance, all used in rapid succession, and influenced by his experience with the Crackerjacks black acrobatic act during the second world war.</p> <p>Hip hop's roots can be traced back to the likes of the Crackerjacks. They incorporated different strands of European and Arabic tumbling traditions into jazz dance, astonishing their original mentors and audiences when they toured Europe with their ability to always hit the beat while executing and completing somersaults.</p> <p>Born in Brooklyn, the teenage Chisholm made weekly treks on the A-train to Harlem's Savoy Ballroom, where he imbibed the litany of swing through evenings of hard lindy-hopping. In 1942, he formed an act with Jimmie \"Tricky\" Field and, in keeping with the then new cool ethos, they left behind the boisterous acrobatics and adopted a studied, nonchalant style. The new act lasted only a short while - Field was drafted - but a booking at Harlem's Apollo brought Chisholm to the notice of the Crackerjacks, who were looking for a new cane exponent, and Chisholm spent four years with the group. His baton-whirling provided another dimension to the group performance.</p> <p>He then turned solo and and had no problem finding work with some of the top bands of the time. From the mid-1950s he toured America, Europe and the Pacific Rim.

      "bodyText": "The career of the American jazz dancer and acrobat, Joe Chisholm, who has died of cancer aged 75, began in 40s Harlem, took in many of the great swing bands, and flourished in Britain in the late 60s and 70s. Chisholm could bring an audience to him through jokes, impossibly fast cane moves, and elegant tap dance, all used in rapid succession, and influenced by his experience with the Crackerjacks black acrobatic act during the second world war. Hip hop's roots can be traced back to the likes of the Crackerjacks. They incorporated different strands of European and Arabic tumbling traditions into jazz dance, astonishing their original mentors and audiences when they toured Europe with their ability to always hit the beat while executing and completing somersaults. Born in Brooklyn, the teenage Chisholm made weekly treks on the A-train to Harlem's Savoy Ballroom, where he imbibed the litany of swing through evenings of hard lindy-hopping. In 1942, he formed an act with Jimmie \"Tricky\" Field and, in keeping with the then new cool ethos, they left behind the boisterous acrobatics and adopted a studied, nonchalant style. The new act lasted only a short while - Field was drafted - but a booking at Harlem's Apollo brought Chisholm to the notice of the Crackerjacks, who were looking for a new cane exponent, and Chisholm spent four years with the group. His baton-whirling provided another dimension to the group performance. He then turned solo and and had no problem finding work with some of the top bands of the time. From the mid-1950s he toured America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. His reputation led him to a revival of the Cotton Club Revue, featuring the Cab Calloway Orchestra. In 1968, Chisholm joined the musical, Lady Be Good, with Lionel Blair at London's Saville Theatre. He later appeared in the royal variety show, Bubbling Brown Sugar, the Al Jolson Story - and on the northern club circuit. Chisholm briefly returned to the US in 1972 but, back in Britain, joined an American expatriate jazz dance group. Later, a small-scale revival of the Cotton Club Revue enabled him to exert his charm on larger audiences again. By the mid-1980s, arthritis forced him to give up cane whirling, but he continued performing, even when it was only lunchtime spots in senior citizens' day centres. Joe Chisholm, dancer and acrobat, born April 25 1925; died January 30 2001",

He lives 20 miles from the Sellafield reprocessing plant and has spent most of the past six years photographing the landmarks of the atomic age: Los Alamos, where the Americans developed the atom bomb; Trinity, where they first tested it; Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, where a power station came terrifyingly close to meltdown. And he was in Japan in 1995 for the 50th anniversary of the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. </p> <p>Nevertheless, he still felt worried as he neared the exclusion zone around Chernobyl power station, site of the world's worst nuclear accident. Thirty-one people died immediately after the reactor fire in 1986; Ukraine has blamed the radiation that spewed out for at least 8,000 more deaths. More than 130,000 people had to be evacuated, and, 15 years on, soldiers still bar entry to 2,800 sq km of land around the power station. </p> <p>\"It was grey and overcast, one of those really murky days,\" Darwell recalls. \"I was thinking, 'What am I doing here? What am I doing here? ' And then my driver started playing The Road to Hell, by Chris Rea. And I thought, 'That about sums it up.' \" </p> <p>Yet what he found on the other side of the checkpoint was far more complex. \"Part of me was expecting a devastated wasteland but everything was growing and lush. The locals did point out mutations - like branches growing on trees where they shouldn't be - but the zone is almost like a wildlife park. There's no folk, so you see herds of elk and wild boar wandering around. Mind you, some of them were showing mutations too.\" </p> <p>Darwell's photographs from that trip in late 1999 can now be seen in a book and exhibition called Legacy. There's the snap he took while waiting to pass through the outer cordon, still 30km from the power station - a dog resting in the middle of the road, as if that's the last place it would be disturbed. It brings to mind the beautiful beast from Stalker, Andrey Tarkovsky's eerie 1979 movie. That too featured a danger zone guarded by gun-toting guards, almost empty of humans and green with an obscene fertility. </p> <p>Inside Chernobyl's exclusion zone, weeds grow knee-high, trees poke up through abandoned homes, flowers bloom among fire engines used during the crisis and too radioactive ever to serve again. </p> <p>There's no artifice to Darwell's pictures, no fancy filters or tricksy angles, so you have to think about the subject rather than its presentation. One shot shows half a dozen military helicopters slowly rotting in a field, the red stars on their fuselages still visible. How bad must things get, you marvel, for a government to throw away aircraft? And then you remember the pilots who died after dumping their loads of sand and chemicals onto the flaming core of reactor number four. </p> <p>The Ukrainians spent six months removing and burying contaminated material from around the reactor: machinery, buildings, trees, soil. Of course, the clean-up claimed more lives. Darwell visited a landfill site at Buryakovka, and there's something shocking about his picture of a nondescript field with a radiation hazard sign planted where a scarecrow should be. He was led around by workers with Geiger counters, who steered him away from any hot spots. </p> <p>The Ukrainians were protected by the sort of paper masks used by decorators. Darwell was slightly better off: he had been lent a pair of wellies when he passed through the zone's inner cordon, 10km from the power station. He also wore a special badge to record his exposure, but could not have it checked until he returned to Britain. \"The best way to describe it is a miner's canary - only you don't know it's dead until three weeks later.\" </p> <p>When Chernobyl went mushroom-shaped, it took the authorities a day and a half to begin bussing the locals out. At first they claimed the power plant was simply venting steam as usual. Darwell's pictures suggest the panic that ruled once the truth got out: a kindergarten floor scattered with crushed dolls; dodgem cars abandoned between bumps; portraits gathering mildew on mantelpieces; washing left on clothes lines. </p> <p>It took Darwell 18 months to get permission to visit the exclusion zone, so he made the most of his three weeks there. He took in the power station itself, which only closed down last December (\"It was like visiting a factory - we went and had tea at the canteen\"), many of the 70 empty villages and the city of Pripyat, which bars visitors whenever the radiation readings blip upwards. \"It's all concrete,\" he explains. \"It absorbs radiation like a giant sponge. They can't even knock it down because the dust would be too dangerous.\" </p> <p>In the world's most radioactive city, among all the rubble and rust and peeling paint, he photographed a lecture room full of charts cataloguing enemy nuclear weapons and the pointless precautions to be taken in the event of a missile strike. </p> <p>The zone's guards were relaxed chaps, keen to talk about fishing and show their snapshots of the giant catfish they caught in Chernobyl's outflow. So Darwell's scene of a militia man standing alone in the middle of a field \"to prevent homeless people from moving into the village\" may raise a hollow laugh. Yet a few of the older locals have returned, feeling safer in their old homes than in the prefab blocks on the edge of Kiev, where too many of their friends have sickened and died. The government seems to have decided it's not worth trying to kick them out again. </p> <p>So there they are living off the contaminated land, growing crops, using wells, keeping cattle. In the village of Opachichi, Darwell drank the milk from the local cows, which was \"rather frightening\". \"A little radiation is very good for you,\" one of the locals told him. \"It will make your hair grow - look at the vegetables and flowers.\" There's a lovely shot of a couple called Nicholai and Anastasia, who must be in their 60s or 70s, sitting in their Soviet-floral-horror sitting room and looking as if they've got a bit of a buzz on. The villagers make their own vodka and, when Darwell dropped in, the pair plied him with moonshine for five hours. \"I was absolutely out of my mind,\" he says. </p> <p>Elsewhere, three babushkas from the same village pose with their buckets by a well; one of them tells a great story that sadly finds no place in the book's brief introduction. She was a PoW in Germany during the second world war and walked all the way back to Ukraine. \"Later,\" says Darwell, \"her husband left her and the house burned down . . . and then there was Chernobyl.\" But she returned a second time. </p> <p>Darwell's book gives her no words, so let's use what Tarkovsky's Stalker said when he found himself back in his own strange world: \"Everything I have is here. Here in the zone. My happiness, my freedom, my dignity.\" Chernobyl's returnees may be happy to live with the risks of low-level radiation, but Legacy ends on a sombre note. \"The concrete sarcophagus surrounding the damaged reactor is now in imminent danger of collapse. This would lead to a second Chernobyl disaster, with tons of highly radioactive dust released into the atmosphere. Some scientists believe the probability of this happening within the next few years to be 'extremely high'.\" </p> <p>So is this the most alarming trip Darwell has ever made? Oh no, he says. \"There's only one place I've ever had trouble. They actually came with dogs and guns when I was photo-graphing. I was on the public highway but they didn't seem to appreciate that fact. As soon as I turned up, the police would arrive. It got to a point where they'd just recognise my car. </p> <p>\"Yes, Sellafield was slightly hairy.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Legacy the book is published by Dewi Lewis, price \u00a310.99.

      "body": "<p>If everything goes the way creator David Chase has planned it, The Sopranos will only run for four seasons. We've had two already, and the third is now airing in the United States, so already we're at the half-way point. The end is in sight, only 26 episodes away from us. </p> <p>This will be heartbreaking news for fans who assume that, like many a successful American import, The Sopranos will run for years and years. It won't, but you only have to watch the last few miserable seasons of such formerly hardy perennials as M*A*S*H and LA Law to realise that that is actually a good thing. American TV shows always outstay their welcome, especially if they rise to the status of a national institution, as The Sopranos has. Given enough time, network executives will grind a good show into fine powder, as long as the sponsors' dollars keep pouring in, and no matter if the aging show is rapidly haemorrhaging energy, inspiration and original cast members. </p> <p>But David Chase is on HBO, not at a network, and the special freedoms he has found there are what have made The Sopranos so successful. His characters can swear like troopers, spill all the blood they want and cavort with all the naked Russian hookers they can handle. But the real liberties Chase enjoys are quite separate from issues of censorship. They include being able to take his time as a writer (he asked to delay the start of this season to get the script right), trafficking in contradictions and ambiguities rather than the moral monotones sanctioned by the networks' Standards-and-Practices lawyers, and assuming a higher intelligence on the part of his audience than has ever been fashionable in mainstream TV circles. </p> <p>The greatest privilege a show's creator could have though, is the right to name the date that his show bites the dust, rather than have some suit whack it for him - typically over the phone at 4.30 on a Friday afternoon. For Chase this means the chance to work creatively with the dramatic architecture of The Sopranos, to set up themes and storylines that may not pay off for another year or more, to delve ever more deeply, like a North Jersey Balzac or Dos Passos, into the overlapping milieux - suburban America and \"this thing of ours\" - that he's staked out, and to stage a structured, orderly withdrawal and climax in two years time. </p> <p>There will be no reunion specials \"taped before a live studio audience\", no sequels, no excuses, and no Godfather III-style aesthetic betrayals. Just an Italian-American symphony with four movements, a quartet of great American novels, a quadruple-decker wedding cake iced with the dried blood of dead wise guys. </p> <p>So here we stand at the mid-point. When series two faded out, Chase had rather bravely killed off two of the show's favourite characters. Tormented stoolie Big Pussy Bompensiero, Tony's best friend, was thoroughly ventilated before being tossed into the Atlantic, and David Proval's tightly wound psycho-upstart Richie Aprile was dispatched prematurely into the hereafter by Tony's scheming sister, New Age welfare-cheat Janice (Aida Turturro). Chase ended the series by pulling away from Meadow Soprano's graduation party to images of mafia foot soldiers and their myriad victims, culminating with a desolate shot of David Scatino (Robert Patrick, who'll also be missed), the \"dee-generate fuckin' gambler\" and neighbour on whom Tony and his crew feasted like locusts, fleeing to his doom in Las Vegas. </p> <p>With perfect symmetry, season three starts outside and works its way inwards, through the perspective of the FBI's North Jersey Organized Crime Division, as its officers make two trips to install a wire in the basement of the Soprano house. While the installation takes place, the Feds watch each member of the family, from Carmela and Adriana at the tennis club (whose lesbian tennis coach is all twitchy for Adriana), to Anthony Jr ducking school and smoking with his skate-punk pals, and Meadow, now ensconced in the dorms at Columbia University in Manhattan. This episode (one of two making up the US season premiere) works mainly as an overture, updating each cast member, introducing newcomers and bringing hitherto minor characters into the foreground. </p> <p>There's more symmetry in the resemblances between the Feds and the wise guys: each have their rituals, their uniforms, their beer guts, their professional argots, their codes of masculinity and their fatal delusions. And both value systems, Chase suggests, are equally full of shit, with Tony whacking whoever needs to be whacked and the FBI breaking the very laws they've sworn to uphold in order to nail their man. Their crudity and invasiveness very nearly puts us on Tony's side. </p> <p>Then just as we get comfortable, it's episode two, the narrative proper commences and immediately reality slaps us in the face. Fat cuddly Tony makes a series of brutal racist remarks to a half-black, half-Jewish male friend of Meadow (they're home watching The Public Enemy for a course called, hysterically, \"Images of Hyper-Capitalist Self-Advancement in the Age of the Studio System\") in an attempt to ensure that he won't date her. </p> <p>No one will be surprised to learn that Livia Soprano's oft-expressed fondest wish - \"I wish the Lord would take me now!\" - has finally been granted. There wasn't much choice. Actress Nancy Marchand had suffered from lung cancer since the show started and she died after last season had aired. Then again, what better way to open a new season than with a mob funeral for someone so universally loathed? The gruesome wake that ensues is one of the best sequences ever shot for American television. </p> <p>Anyone who thought that last season was inferior to the first (and I'm not one of them) is advised to stick around. Season three offers new characters such as Joe Pantoliano as an ambitious earner being held back by Tony. He seems more ordered and less impulsive than Richie Aprile, and therefore a more formidable opponent. Not to mention the show's enduring pleasures, like Tony Jr's blank little face and foul little mouth (\"what - no fuckin' zitti?\"), Carmela's Jersey hair'n'nails, Adriana's transcendent trashiness, the magnificent pug-mug of James Gandolfini, Furio's obsession with pricey consumer electronics and bad TV shows, and the way that Paulie and Silvio never, ever stop twitching. </p> <p>As Silvio keeps saying, quoting Michael Corleone in The Godfather III, \"Just when I thought I was out... they pulled me back in!\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Sopranos, season three, starts on E4 on Sunday 24 June at 10.30pm, and on Channel 4 from September</p>",

Having tried to talk about art on the radio, I winced at the confidence of the press notes for Art Atlas (Radio 4), a \"ground-breaking\" new series demonstrating that \"pictures really can be better on the radio\". It doesn't say better than what, but Robert McNab's \"highly personal\" take on visual culture does have a winning verve about it. </p> <p>In the first programme, he looked at Paint Rage - the violence of painting and the sexual brutality of art produced in equally brutal times. McNab took in Berlin, George Grosz, Jackson Pollock, Otto Dix and some diverting true crime stories from the 1920s. One chap chewed open the arteries of his sleeping victims; another \"kept their pickled fingers in his flat\". Robert Crumb, said McNab, is the Grosz of our time. \"What is it about certain types of honesty that sends them running from the room to call the police,\" he pondered, with unintended timeliness, given the goings on at the Saatchi gallery. </p> <p>Art on the wireless is nothing compared to attempting The African Queen (Radio 4), without pictures, Hepburn and Bogey. But Mike Lewis did, adapting CS Forester's tale of sensible middle-class Rose Sayer and diamond cockney geezer Charlie Allnut stuck on a steamboat in Africa during the First World War. Tara Fitzgerald shone as Sayer, and as the sound effects department went gaga with the flies and toads, the love affair seemed as real as it did in the Hollywood version. Pictures aren't always better on the radio, but this was as good as, I realised, sobbing like a twit at the end. </p>",

Having tried to talk about art on the radio, I winced at the confidence of the press notes for Art Atlas (Radio 4), a \"ground-breaking\" new series demonstrating that \"pictures really can be better on the radio\". It doesn't say better than what, but Robert McNab's \"highly personal\" take on visual culture does have a winning verve about it. In the first programme, he looked at Paint Rage - the violence of painting and the sexual brutality of art produced in equally brutal times. McNab took in Berlin, George Grosz, Jackson Pollock, Otto Dix and some diverting true crime stories from the 1920s. One chap chewed open the arteries of his sleeping victims; another \"kept their pickled fingers in his flat\". Robert Crumb, said McNab, is the Grosz of our time. \"What is it about certain types of honesty that sends them running from the room to call the police,\" he pondered, with unintended timeliness, given the goings on at the Saatchi gallery. Art on the wireless is nothing compared to attempting The African Queen (Radio 4), without pictures, Hepburn and Bogey. But Mike Lewis did, adapting CS Forester's tale of sensible middle-class Rose Sayer and diamond cockney geezer Charlie Allnut stuck on a steamboat in Africa during the First World War. Tara Fitzgerald shone as Sayer, and as the sound effects department went gaga with the flies and toads, the love affair seemed as real as it did in the Hollywood version. Pictures aren't always better on the radio, but this was as good as, I realised, sobbing like a twit at the end.",

It was an extremely tense time for everyone, none more so than for the farmer involved, but mercifully he was given the all clear within hours. The collective sigh from the farmers here could almost have been heard in London. Now we wait to hear test results from another farm, just over three miles away from us in a westerly direction. Meanwhile, the Murray family has finally received a negative result from their initial sample, and is awaiting a second visit from a Maff vet in order to lift the tight quarantine restrictions.</p> <p>This constant pressure of not knowing quite where the virus will pop up next takes its toll on us all. I can only surmise it is farming's equivalent of the blitz. In this case we know the bombs (the suspected and/or confirmed outbreaks) will fall, but not the exact location or when they will cease. When the chief vet, Jim Scudamore, told the nation that this could run for months, our hearts sank. Living in the hills is isolating enough, but with added restrictions it is far too hard. All the people we would like to see either live on a farm or next door to a farm. Shopping will become less of a headache as we've concluded there is not so much \"risk\" in the Hexham supermarket, but one trip a week is sufficient as the trek there and back takes ages.</p> <p>The Sedgewick family lives on one of the next door farms, although their farmhouse is four miles away by road. Julie and David have spent years building up a second business, a successful fish and chip van, which has now been off the road for almost three weeks. They worry that their hard-won customer base is dwindling away. We sympathise with everybody caught up in all this.</p> <p>A trip to the local agricultural merchants highlighted the effects. We saw hardly no vehicles on the road. Wallington Hall, a National Trust property, is closed and barred off. On arrival at the suppliers our wheels were sprayed with disinfectant. We all ask the same question - how long can we cope? The general reply: as long as it takes.</p> <p>Lambing, calving and farrowing is now under way in all parts of the country, although naturally spring starts later up here. The effect of the movement restrictions could be catastrophic for us and we have only just begun to fully appreciate this. Although we have been building pens in preparation for the ewes and their lambs, we had overlooked the fact that all our farm buildings are beside a very minor public road. No one but us is using the road through the steading (farmyard), and it doesn't really go anywhere except to the church and then meanders, through lots of gates, way out bye (a Northumberland expression meaning in the middle of nowhere).</p> <p>It is forbidden to bring an animal across the road for any reason, so we cannot even move the cattle from one shed to another (a distance of 75m) in order to clean them out as we frequently have to do. And unless we can get a special licence, we will not be able to make full use of our essential lambing sheds. This thought completely does our heads in, while the workload just increases day by day as lambing gets nearer.</p> <p>One of our ewes has aborted her expected three lambs, as sheep can do just before lambing. All sorts of abnormalities and difficulties are expected in a flock this size and we were not surprised. However, owing to what we have been told about the symptoms of foot and mouth, instead of being left to quietly get over her trauma, the poor ewe endured a gentle yet thorough examination of her mouth, tongue, dental pad and feet. As far as we could tell she was clear, but she gave us a baleful stare when we left her.</p> <p>This week we need to vaccinate the ewes and dose them for intestinal parasites. This will give us the opportunity to look at the flock very closely and examine every mouth as they pass through the pens. Like every other farmer, we've had to work out how to move animals around without touching the road. It has meant that throughout the countryside fences have been taken down and sections of stone walls dismantled.</p> <p>Saturday was spent applying for an occupational licence. I downloaded the rules and regulations and application form and Peter took the forms to the vet in Hexham to be signed. We then wrote a covering letter explaining why we needed the licence and typed up every single ear tag number of every bovine on the place - because we cannot be certain which individual animal will need to be moved. At around 3pm I faxed nine pages to the relevant department at Maff, and now we wait. In theory this licence will allow repeated movement within a holding of a distance up to half a kilometre, but the licence must be carried at all times.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we continue to wait and hope.

      "body": "<p>The sign on the door is confusing. Robert McAlpine, it says. A young man answers. No, he's not in, just popped out, is he expecting you? I ask whether I can leave a message, and trudge up narrow floor after narrow floor to the attic. The flat is in chaos. There are hammers and saws and wood shavings everywhere. Only the walls, decorated in gorgeous abstract paintings, look finished. Most people build their home first and then put up the pictures. Who is Robert McAlpine?</p> <p>My phone rings. Alistair McAlpine is waiting for me at a cafe down the road. The sun is shining, McAlpine is smiling. He stands, like a landmark, in that checked suit that he's worn for ever. The former treasurer of the Tory party, Thatcher's jolly bagman, still looks as if his roly-poly body is going to topple over his tiny size six feet. Apart from Dennis, no one has remained as loyal to Thatcher as McAlpine. Dennis, Margaret and Alistair, they were a model family of sorts. Alistair, 20 or so years younger, the witty, smart, cultured son they never had.</p> <p>We're walking down the street. McAlpine, 58, is apologising for his breathlessness. He says he has trouble breathing and talking at the same time these days, which can cause problems. Eighteen months ago he had a second heart bypass. It was supposed to be fairly routine, but things got nasty. McAlpine ended up having a deathbed conversion to Catholicism, calling for the bagpipes to revive him, and fighting like fury. He shows me a scar from the tracheotomy that saved his life. It looks no worse than a shaving rash, but this is why his voice has been reduced to a gravelly whisper.</p> <p>\" Robert McAlpine?\" he says gnomically. \"That's my grandfather.\" So the flat above the Notting Hill shop is his grandfather's? I'd heard that McAlpine had fallen on hard times.\"No, Robert McAlpine, the builder. I've got the builders in.\"</p> <p>Ah. Robert McAlpine is the legendary Concrete Bob who made the McAlpines a formidably wealthy clan. So Alistair has got the family firm in to do some work on the cheap? \"No, actually it ends up more expensive,\" he says. The builders expect a decent tip.</p> <p>After leaving school with a couple of O-levels, Alistair McAlpine joined the building firm where he stayed for 16 years until he was called to politics by Thatcher. He raised the \u00a3100m that helped her win three elections. When all deserted her, he stood firm. He regarded her cabinet as minnows and traitors, and dismissed her successor John Major for \"hanging about like a pair of curtains\". Last election, he campaigned for the anti-European Referendum Party. Now he's on the turn again.</p> <p>McAlpine has just read William Hague's speech, anticipating Britain as a foreign land. \"I thought it was nonsense,\" he says. \"The Tories were in power four years ago, and if they'd been so keen to save the pound they could have saved it then. Stroke of a pen, going through parliament - would have got it through in a moment. I just find it a bit hypocritical.\" He looks offended when I suggest Hague was trying to invoke Powell's river of blood speech. \"No, no. Enoch was a man of massive intellect. He was a classical scholar. This was Hyde Park corner stuff, rabble rousing. I think Hague reads the editorial of the Daily Mail, and that's today's idea. He's a follower not a leader.\"</p> <p>Whenever he talks about Major and Hague, you sense a golden shadow lurking. \"The thing about Thatcher,\" he says suddenly, \"love her or hate her, she had some philosophical ideas as to how to conduct her life and how to run a country.\" He loved her, of course. He won't say a word against her, just as he won't say a word in favour of those who knifed her. He has a penchant for one-liners, condemning his political foes (often former friends) with a velvet tongue. \"Oh I like the one about Norman Lamont. Major said the recession is going to be shallow and short. I said the only aspect of this recession that is shallow and short is the chancellor of the exchequer. Hee! hee! hee!\" He was always a bit of a one.</p> <p>These days, post politics and with a peerage to his name, he makes his living as a writer. He has three books on the go. A typical McAlpine mix - a short philosophical guide to happiness, a short history of transport and trade, and an unfeasibly long guide to the world's museums. He says it's funny how often people have suggested that he never sticks to anything, whereas in fact he's only had three jobs in his life - builder, treasurer and writer. Admittedly, three very different jobs.</p> <p>Change is important to him. All types of change - professional, political, personal. After being nursed back to health by his second wife, Romilly, he divorced her. There was no one else. He just felt the need to start again after 20 years' marriage. When he left his first wife and two daughters, his disabled mother hit him over the head with her walking stick. For years, his two daughters from the first marriage never spoke to him.</p> <p>He and Thatcher made for an unlikely team: the joyless puritan and the urbane dandy. As a wealthy young man, he bought a series of paintings - six or seven of them - by a tyro called Rothko. He paid around two and a half grand for each of them, and everyone laughed at him. He talks about the terrible beauty of Rothko's death. \"He cut his wrists in the bath and watched the bath water become a Rothko. Extraordinary that. Amazing way to die.\"</p> <p>He never converted Thatcher to Rothko, but he did take her round galleries, encouraged her to dabble. \"She had a very respectable collection of porcelain . . . figures, bowls and teacups.\" He casually mentions that, unlike her MPs, he always used to see her alone in the early days. It must have been a very special relationship, I say. \"I don't know. It would be presumptuous of me to say so,\" he bumbles, lovestruck. \"She was terribly kind to me, very thoughtful, very polite, very kind. Quite unlike the common picture that is painted of her at the time.\" Maybe she fancied him? \"I don't think so!\" He blushes. \"No, I don't think so. I wasn't very fanciable in those days.\" He's talking very quickly. \"Not that I am now. I was very big and fat and quite dishevelled.\"</p> <p>A couple of years after Thatcher was dethroned, McAlpine wrote a book called The Servant, his take on Machiavelli's The Prince. To succeed in politics, he says, you need a prince and a servant and a Big Idea. Thatcher had been his prince, he had been her servant. He inverted the normal notion of a servant - a servant shouldn't be sycophantic, not a placeman, nor a ladder climber. He should be a man of independent means, as McAlpine had been.</p> <p>When did he first realise Thatcher was a prince? \"Margaret was always princely,\" he says. \"But she never had a court in the way that Blair does.\" A few months ago the remaining loyalists organised a lunch for her to mark 25 years since she became Tory leader. \"There were seven or eight people there in total. Just people who had been really close to her. Of them, certainly three had never been there at the start.\" Part-time supporters, he seems to be sniffing. Many of the original Thatcherites were dead - Keith Joseph, Ian Gow, Airey Neave. The last two were killed by the IRA, who also blew up his house. McAlpine was away at the time. He also came through the Brighton bomb unscathed. So many encounters with death, he says, so many escapes. He calls it a miracle.</p> <p>Thatcher, Thatcherite, Thatcherism. A mantra. He calls her a true democrat, says her big idea was that anyone could be a patrician Tory, and that those who did well would look after those less fortunate. But wasn't Thatcherism about loadsamoney and I'm all right, Jack? \"I remember talking to Margaret shortly after she lost power and her saying an aspect of the failure of her policies was that when she gave people responsibilities for their own affairs she also gave them responsibility to plough back the freedom that she'd given them so they would, for instance, support charitable things, and people hadn't really responded. You had the greed from cabinet ministers who went off and got good jobs, to the industrialists who made a lot of money, and money became a raison d'etre.\" The one person who remains blameless is Thatcher herself.</p> <p>Political visions and visionaries always end up compromised, he says. He talks about the parallels between Thatcher and Blair - the way they reinvented their parties, made them electable, and then had to suffer the dilution of ideas. Is Blair the natural successor to Thatcher? \"Well he's a damn sight more Conservative than John Major was.\" How? \"Well Stephen Dorrell was never sacked by Major after saying that it's a very bad idea to own your own house. That's not conservatism for God's sake!\" he says, spitting his cappuccino. The chocolate is stuck to his lips.</p> <p>He explains the difference between a modern-day Tory - bigoted and crude - and a Thatcherite. Does he regard Blair as a Tory or a Thatcherite? \"Oh I think he's a Thatcherite.\" He attacks those Tories who say Blair is an opportunist. \"That's nonsense. I think he's more a man of principle than they realise.\" Perhaps Blair is his new prince? \"Oh yes. I think there's something quite princely about Blair,\" he says excitedly. \"Yeh, he could be a prince.\"</p> <p>Not that he agrees with everything he's done. Take the bombing of Kosovo. \"Completely detestable. The notion that you can fight a war where only one side gets hurt.\" And then there are Jack Straw's draconian policies. \"I don't like this idea of double jeopardy being abolished, because the police will say, 'Bloody 'ell, he shouldn't have got off, we'll have him in the dock again.' Look, I couldn't stand Michael Howard as a home secretary, so imagine what I feel about Straw.\"</p> <p>And drugs? \"I'd certainly legalise pot. I took it once or twice. But I never found it satisfactory.\" That traditional line eh? Never inhaled, well not in front of the prime minister? He giggles. \"Yes, not in the presence of the prime minister! \" And finally, he's keen on a more progressive tax system. \"I'd like to see a sliding scale of VAT where caviar was 100%, potatoes zero.\"</p> <p>So he's somewhat more radical than Blair? \"Possibly, yes.\" Eleven years is a long time in politics. He says of course he has changed since Thatcher resigned. \"It's inconceivable when you think about something that you always come to the same conclusion. So you're bound to have a great stack of your life that you think that was wrong.\"</p> <p>It's a quarter of a century since he found himself short of cash and sold his Rothkos. He received \u00a310,000 for one of them and was rather chuffed. \"About 15 years ago, the art dealer Lesley Waddington found an inventory of my art collection from the 60s. He had it valued, and it came to \u00a380m. In those days a Rothko was a couple of hundred thousand. I think the last Rothko sold in New York for $24m.\" He also gave away much of his art to galleries.</p> <p>I ask McAlpine what he's worth today. Well, he says, considerably less than the million he had as a young man. \"I think most of that's gone\". Does he regret not having made money from his art? \"No,\" he says, \"it's a vindication of all those years people said to my father, 'It's a shame about your son, he's a bit odd you know, I saw this blank painting in his house.'\" You sense he would have been crippled by such wealth, that he was eager to unburden himself. In many ways, McAlpine has always been an unlikely Conservative.</p> <p>So if Blair were to offer him a job in his cabinet would he accept? \"Well look, half the Conservative party are in public positions for Tony Blair. Heseltine and Patten . . . If Tony Blair offered me a public position?\" He deliberates. For a second. And then his eyes light up. \"Course, I'd take it. Minister for the arts, why not?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The sign on the door is confusing. Robert McAlpine, it says. A young man answers. No, he's not in, just popped out, is he expecting you? I ask whether I can leave a message, and trudge up narrow floor after narrow floor to the attic. The flat is in chaos. There are hammers and saws and wood shavings everywhere. Only the walls, decorated in gorgeous abstract paintings, look finished. Most people build their home first and then put up the pictures. Who is Robert McAlpine? My phone rings. Alistair McAlpine is waiting for me at a cafe down the road. The sun is shining, McAlpine is smiling. He stands, like a landmark, in that checked suit that he's worn for ever. The former treasurer of the Tory party, Thatcher's jolly bagman, still looks as if his roly-poly body is going to topple over his tiny size six feet. Apart from Dennis, no one has remained as loyal to Thatcher as McAlpine. Dennis, Margaret and Alistair, they were a model family of sorts. Alistair, 20 or so years younger, the witty, smart, cultured son they never had. We're walking down the street. McAlpine, 58, is apologising for his breathlessness. He says he has trouble breathing and talking at the same time these days, which can cause problems. Eighteen months ago he had a second heart bypass. It was supposed to be fairly routine, but things got nasty. McAlpine ended up having a deathbed conversion to Catholicism, calling for the bagpipes to revive him, and fighting like fury. He shows me a scar from the tracheotomy that saved his life. It looks no worse than a shaving rash, but this is why his voice has been reduced to a gravelly whisper. \" Robert McAlpine?\" he says gnomically. \"That's my grandfather.\" So the flat above the Notting Hill shop is his grandfather's? I'd heard that McAlpine had fallen on hard times.\"No, Robert McAlpine, the builder. I've got the builders in.\" Ah. Robert McAlpine is the legendary Concrete Bob who made the McAlpines a formidably wealthy clan. So Alistair has got the family firm in to do some work on the cheap? \"No, actually it ends up more expensive,\" he says. The builders expect a decent tip. After leaving school with a couple of O-levels, Alistair McAlpine joined the building firm where he stayed for 16 years until he was called to politics by Thatcher. He raised the \u00a3100m that helped her win three elections. When all deserted her, he stood firm. He regarded her cabinet as minnows and traitors, and dismissed her successor John Major for \"hanging about like a pair of curtains\". Last election, he campaigned for the anti-European Referendum Party. Now he's on the turn again. McAlpine has just read William Hague's speech, anticipating Britain as a foreign land. \"I thought it was nonsense,\" he says. \"The Tories were in power four years ago, and if they'd been so keen to save the pound they could have saved it then. Stroke of a pen, going through parliament - would have got it through in a moment. I just find it a bit hypocritical.\" He looks offended when I suggest Hague was trying to invoke Powell's river of blood speech. \"No, no. Enoch was a man of massive intellect. He was a classical scholar. This was Hyde Park corner stuff, rabble rousing. I think Hague reads the editorial of the Daily Mail, and that's today's idea. He's a follower not a leader.\" Whenever he talks about Major and Hague, you sense a golden shadow lurking. \"The thing about Thatcher,\" he says suddenly, \"love her or hate her, she had some philosophical ideas as to how to conduct her life and how to run a country.\" He loved her, of course.

      "trailText": "How the case was won before it reached court",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Lipstadt's lawyers needed access to Irving's material. \"We decided that in order to win this case we needed to see what Irving had in his study,\" says James Libson, one of the lawyers from the firm of Mishcon de Reya, which represents her. But they also needed to get inside Irving's head, and documents alone wouldn't be enough. To Mishcon de Reya, discovery wasn't just about documents; it was about control.</p> <p>Irving's complaint made clear that he intended to put the Holocaust on trial. Instead, Anthony Julius, who led Lipstadt's defence, would use discovery to put Irving on trial. He aimed to \"run it as if it was a history seminar and Irving was a rather unintelligent student\".</p> <p>\"We mounted a gigantic disclosure operation,\" says Libson. Both sides were required to make available to the opposing side any material either party had in its \"possession, custody or power related to any matter in issue\". Discovery itself is automatic. But if either side feels the other is holding back, they can apply for a court order to enforce \"fuller and better\" discovery.</p> <p>\"Irving's first discovery was just a list of his books, plus commendations of his work by other historians and some historical documents,\" says Libson. \"There was no record of his contacts with rightwing extremists, and no diaries.\"</p> <p>Julius would have to persuade a special judge, called a master, that Irving had held back documents, and that these were relevant.</p> <p>The discovery hearings began on September 10, 1998 before Master John Trench. Over the preceding spring and summer, Libson and the two graduate students made regular visits to Irving's flat to inspect the material in his first list.</p> <p>Some of what they wanted was in plain sight. The existence of Irving's diaries, for instance, was hardly a secret. Irving's position on the diaries - like his position on many other items - was minimalist.

      "bodyText": "Lipstadt's lawyers needed access to Irving's material. \"We decided that in order to win this case we needed to see what Irving had in his study,\" says James Libson, one of the lawyers from the firm of Mishcon de Reya, which represents her. But they also needed to get inside Irving's head, and documents alone wouldn't be enough. To Mishcon de Reya, discovery wasn't just about documents; it was about control. Irving's complaint made clear that he intended to put the Holocaust on trial. Instead, Anthony Julius, who led Lipstadt's defence, would use discovery to put Irving on trial. He aimed to \"run it as if it was a history seminar and Irving was a rather unintelligent student\". \"We mounted a gigantic disclosure operation,\" says Libson. Both sides were required to make available to the opposing side any material either party had in its \"possession, custody or power related to any matter in issue\". Discovery itself is automatic. But if either side feels the other is holding back, they can apply for a court order to enforce \"fuller and better\" discovery. \"Irving's first discovery was just a list of his books, plus commendations of his work by other historians and some historical documents,\" says Libson. \"There was no record of his contacts with rightwing extremists, and no diaries.\" Julius would have to persuade a special judge, called a master, that Irving had held back documents, and that these were relevant. The discovery hearings began on September 10, 1998 before Master John Trench. Over the preceding spring and summer, Libson and the two graduate students made regular visits to Irving's flat to inspect the material in his first list. Some of what they wanted was in plain sight. The existence of Irving's diaries, for instance, was hardly a secret. Irving's position on the diaries - like his position on many other items - was minimalist. If the lawyers let him know which dates they wanted, Irving promised to take a look and see if there was any relevant material. If he found any, he would be happy to disclose it. Anything broader, he argued, would open his diaries to a fishing expedition by the defence. Julius argued that since Irving brought this case, and the law said his client had a right to defend herself, that gave him a fishing licence. Irving's approach was to produce a mass of documents having little or nothing to do with the suit, but which Libson and his assistants were forced to read in order to rule them out. Included in Irving's first discovery, for instance, was a videotape recording the birth of his daughter, and audiotapes relating to the Kennedy assassination. The hearings before Master Trench took two days. \"When we got into court we were so well prepared,\" says Julius. \"We broke down the kinds of documents into categories, and we gave the master a draft order we wanted him to make at the very beginning of the case.\" In a way, from that point Irving lost the argument. With the master already in \"I'm making an order\" mode, the rest of the hearing just became a tussle over terms. Irving knew he had been outboxed. It was time for a change in tactics. During the lunch break on the second day of discovery, he approached Penguin's lawyers. He would be willing, he told them, to settle the case for \u00a3500. Were they interested? Later that evening, Irving sent his terms in writing to Davenport Lyons, Penguin's outside counsel: If Penguin would write him \"an open letter withdrawing the allegations made\" in Denying the Holocaust, would promise not to republish the book, and would \"as a token of apology . . . pay the sum of \u00a3500 to the British Limbless ex-Servicemen's Association,\" Irving would drop Penguin from his action. If Penguin did walk away from the suit - and there were sound business reasons to at least consider doing so - then that would be a serious blow to Lipstadt's credibility.

The Victorian merchant princes of Liverpool left their city as richly endowed as any in the land, and for a century the city itself was rich enough, and proud enough, for the local authorities to buy lavishly. The result was a string of local museums with collections of national or international importance, but no national profile except among the most knowledgeable connoisseurs. In 1986 the museums were brought together as the national museums and galleries on Merseyside, and Foster became their first director. Just caring for the collections - ensuring that the roof over them was reasonably weather-tight, that there were enough working light bulbs to see them by, and enough staff to open the doors and let the people in - would have been more than enough to keep one man busy.

A comprehensive new survey of \"undervotes\" in Palm Beach county shows that Mr Gore would have gained 784 more votes than George Bush if every excluded paper bearing some kind of mark next to a candidate's name had been counted. The butterfly ballot, which has candidates' names on opposing pages with a row of punch holes in the middle, confused thousands of voters in the Democratic stronghold, which was one of the areas at the centre of the post-election recount battle. Those Palm Beach votes would have been enough on their own for Mr Gore to overtake Mr Bush, who was declared the winner in Florida by a statewide margin of 537 votes. The Palm Beach recount figures came too late to be included in the official tally of votes certified by the Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris 19 days after the November 7 election. The new survey, conducted by the Palm Beach Post, looked at all the 9,150 disputed undervotes of all kinds, including 5,736 which contained marks next to the names of Mr Bush and Mr Gore and which Judge Burton ordered should not be counted.

The tax, which would add about \u00a310 to the cost of every purchase, was not mentioned by the chancellor in his budget last week. It is to be levied from June after a judgment in the House of Lords with far-reaching implications for VAT law. The Royal National Institute for Deaf People said it was told by Customs and Excise on Friday that the judgment was also likely to lead to VAT on the private dispensing of hearing aids. A Customs spokesman told the Guardian that its move was limited to opticians, but an official told the RNID that the judgment would eventually affect other services. This could add 10-15% to the price of the latest digital hearing aids that are not yet available on the NHS in most areas and retail for about \u00a32,500. The decision by Customs to move against the opticians followed years of argument about whether their dispensing services should be exempt from VAT. The tax was imposed in 1988, but lifted in 1995 after the courts ruled that VAT should only be levied on frames and lenses - not the cost of the advice given to customers before they decided on their purchases. Customs decided to reintroduce the tax after a recent House of Lords ruling in an apparently unrelated case about credit card protection services. The department said this redefined VAT law.

HSE staff are under pressure from John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, to hasten their approval of a new safety case for the government's public private partnership. Official figures issued today by the Capital Transport Campaign, the independent organisation which lobbies for better public transport in London, confirm that safety remains one of the most important issues on the underground. The figures, obtained from the Department of Transport, reveal the maximum number of passengers that can be carried in a single underground carriage. \"Very crowded\" on the tube is defined by the government as when there are five or more standing for every four seated. The government's \"planned standard\" is for one person standing for each seated. Official LU figures for each line show that the Hammersmith and City line is allowed to have maximum crowding of 563%. A train of 212 passengers seated is allowed to carry 180 passengers standing. The Central line is allowed to carry 210 seated and 180 standing (518%), the Bakerloo line 194 passengers seated and 158 standing (439%), and the Victoria line 192 passengers and 156 standing (433%). Overcrowding is one of the main issues which has not been resolved to the satisfaciton of the HSE, although it cannot challenge government rules on overcrowding which are never enforced. But the HSE has told London Underground that it must deal with the problem of overcrowding at stations. It wants information on crowd management, risk assessments for both employees and the public and the measures in place to control crowds. It wants details on emergency routes, procedures for deciding the level of evacuation, and the arrangements for communicating through staff and the public in an emergency.

      "bodyText": "Families of victims of the Marchioness river boat disaster were yesterday devastated by new claims that tissue, and possibly whole organs, were taken from bodies without consent. They want John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, to investigate allegations that body parts were stored for more than a decade in glass jars in a London hospital. The development is bound to reignite the debate over the retention of body parts after the scandals at Alder Hey hospital and the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Relatives of Marchioness victims have long harboured suspicions that in some cases the bodies were not returned complete. But it has always been denied that organs were removed. Now, if it is proven, more than a decade on, that organs or tissue were taken, families will face the prospect of holding second funerals. Some are already considering legal action. Fifty-one people died when the Marchioness sank after colliding with the dredger Bowbelle on the river Thames in 1989. Two reports into the disaster, which were ordered by Mr Prescott and are being overseen by Lord Justice Clarke, are due to be made public within the next two weeks. One report is a criminal report into who was responsible for the collision and the second is a non-statutory process examining the identification procedure, including why 25 victims had their hands cut off for fingerprinting tests. The bereaved were originally told that only blood and urine samples were taken for tests for drugs and alcohol. During the non-statutory inquiry a pathologist, Richard Shepherd, who at the time of the disaster was a lecturer in forensic medicine at Guy's hospital and took a leading role in the postmortem examinations, admitted that \"if appropriate\" tissue was retained for study. However, Margaret Lockwood Croft, who has led the Marchioness Action Group for nearly 11 years, yesterday said she was told after the inquiries that containers holding tissues or body parts of four of the victims had been found in the mortuary. She said that tissue from lungs, kidneys, hearts, brain and spleen was discovered. Mrs Lockwood Croft said it was possible that material had been taken from many more than four victims. Mrs Lockwood Croft, who first became suspicious after not being allowed to see her son's body when it was returned to her, said: \"Some families want to know exactly what was taken from their loved ones. Many now face the trauma of reburials.\" Eileen Dallaglio, the mother of one of the youngest victims, 19-year-old Francesca, said: \"It's appalling. I feel our human rights have been violated. There is something wrong with a society which fails to give parents the choice about what happens to their dead children.\" The 1961 Human Tissue Act made it lawful for a doctor to authorise removal of body parts for medical education or research purposes \"if, having made such reasonable inquiry as may be practicable, he has no reason to believe\" that any relative objects. In scandals such as Alder Hey, where organs were systematically stripped from children, the crux was the way doctors interpreted the law and how much information was given to parents. Many parents of children who had died at Alder Hey agreed to \"tissue\" being removed, only to find later that their child's entire organ system had been stripped out. Following the publication of the Alder Hey report, Alan Milburn, the health secretary, announced a series of measures intended to make sure the scandal is never repeated. A spokeswoman for Mr Prescott's Department of Transport, which ordered the Marchioness inquiries, said the tissue was removed as part of standard postmortem procedure. Lord Justice Clarke's report is due to be published this month. \u0095 Doctors should spend more time explaining procedures to patients to ensure they have their full consent to treatment, according to guidelines published today by the British Medical Association.

His studio by the banks of the Neva is crammed with icons and statues, busts and torsos representing the Russian pantheon.

But taking pride of place on a black pedestal, incongruous among the historic images, sits the chalk-white face of President Putin, the only likeness of a living man in the studio. The incongruity is lost on Mr Palmin, a patriot who regards the president as the first Russian leader in his lifetime worthy of the name. \"Putin is a historic figure, too.

It's a tribute.\" Less than a year after his election as Russia's second president, Mr Putin is already being cast in bronze. He is also being immortalised in oil on canvas and in children's schoolbooks. Village mayors commemorate his fleeting visits with \"In Putin's Footsteps\" tours of the muddy streets where the president trod. Ski slopes are to bear the president's name, and there is talk of churches being blessed with it too. Spin doctors say that Mr Putin is the only actor on Russia's political stage. Newspaper polls are organised to reveal that Russian women think Mr Putin the sexiest man in Russia. The pollsters liken him to a doctor with the Russian people as his patients. In short, the phenomenon of Mr Putin, an unknown bureaucrat as recently as two years ago, is acquiring the proportions of a personality cult. \"We supported him, we support him now, and we will continue to support him unconditionally,\" says Viktor Yurakov, a St Petersburg politician who is the local cheerleader-in-chief for the president. The myth-making that surrounds his inscrutable character echoes for many the personality cults erected around the Soviet Union's communist dictators: figures such as Lenin and Stalin acquired iconic quasi-religious status in a society that was officially atheistic. The veneration of Mr Putin, whether genuine or engineered, is particularly evident in St Petersburg. While Mr Palmin transforms his Putin bust from plaster to wax and then bronze, a local businessman has just discovered that Mr Putin planted a maple tree by the city's Canadian consulate nearly six years ago, when he was a city official.He has slapped a brass plaque on the tree which reads: Planted by V Putin October 7 1995. In October Mr Yurakov handed out a cartoon booklet to the city's infants on their first day at primary school with snapshots from the president's childhood. \"No one knew he would be president,\" the booklet gushed. \"But all the boys and girls knew that Volodya Putin was a real pal you could count on. Then he grew up, studied and worked hard, helped good people and did not like bad people at all.\" Vladimir Ivchenko, who helped design the booklet, says: \"We just wanted to show our pride that a good lad has taken over. He's good, he's strong, he's decent, he's ours and he's president now.\" Outside St Petersburg, the little village of Izborsk was the site of an unscheduled stop by the presidential motorcade last August. Visitors to the village are now treated to a walking tour which marks the spots \"where Putin bought a cucumber\", \"where Putin took off his jacket and tried water from a spring\", and \"where Putin touched a tree and made a wish\". But if St Petersburg is leading the presidential myth-making, Moscow, too, is doing its part. A gallery in the capital recently mounted an exhibition of presidential portraits, entitled Our Putin, featuring the leader as a stiff-jawed visionary. Nikas Safronov, one of Moscow's most popular painters, is churning out oil paintings of a steely-eyed president peering out into Russia from the Kremlin's walls. They combine Stalinist socialist realism with Russian heritage kitsch. Nostalgia, mood music, and popular psychology are clearly key ingredients in Mr Putin's recipe for success. He has publicly discouraged the hero worship, telling Russian interviewers in December: \"I understand that when somebody does such things, he or she is probably guided by the best of intentions, and that he or she thinks well of me. \"I would like to thank them, but ask them not to do this. [But] I cannot actively stop this.\" Mr Yurakov has been reprimanded by the Kremlin for being too crude in his hero-worship. But he attributes that to Muscovite jealousy and the traditional rivalry between the two cities. \"Putin just said thanks, but I don't need this. He's modest. He didn't criticise us. He can't forbid us loving him.\" Whether throwing combatants on the judo mat, leaping into jet fighters or cutting a dash down the ski slopes of Austria or the Caucasus, Mr Putin, despite his coyness, is acutely aware of cultivating the image of an action man on Russia's television screens. His KGB past, too, however uneventful, is milked for all its mysterious allure. In St Petersburg, Mr Palmin is plotting a little private party to unveil the first bronze Putin later this month, marking the president's election last March. \"Putin is the first living politician I've done. I'd refuse to do Yeltsin or Gorbachev,\" he says. \"Maybe it recalls the Soviet era, but that's not so bad. Not everything was bad in Soviet times.\"",

There were safe conduct passes for men who wanted to break the curfew, but they risked being pelted with flour and water by women shouting \"Go home, there's housework to be done.\" From the doorway of a bar, Mohammed Ali, a warder at the women's jail in the city, was unimpressed. \"I don't agree with the clowning of this idiot mayor,\" he growled. \"They don't have the right to stop us going out. We own the street.\" Mr Mockus, best-known for baring his buttocks to rowdy students when he was the rector of the National University, stayed in to read stories to his four-year old daughter. He said the curfew was an attempt to make the people of Bogota confront its rampant street crime, domestic violence and absentee fathers. \"We want to let women take over the city's public space and increase men's participation in the domestic space,\" he said.",

Dr Besigye told journalists this weekend: \"I am afraid if something is not done and done immediately the elections will be carried out in an atmosphere which cannot be remotely described as free and fair.\" His comments echo those of the US-based Human Rights Watch, which has said that the level of violence could undermine the credibility of the election. Dr Besigye voiced particular concern at the appointment of the army commander, Major-General Jeje Odongo, as head of security during the election period.

There are six challengers, but only two real contenders: Mr Museveni, who has ruled since 1986, and Dr Besigye, his former physician and ally. Both support the Movement government, which restricts political party activity in the name of national unity, but Dr Besigye is campaigning as a reformist. Last week, in a development which illustrates the tense atmosphere between the two main candidates, the government declared its former ally Rwanda, a \"hostile country\", ranking it alongside the Democratic Republic of Congo, with which it is at war. Mr Museveni said yesterday that the decision was taken after clashes last year between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in the north-eastern Congolese city of Kisangani.

They said the plan to divert water to the fruit and vegetable growing regions of Murcia, Valencia and Almeria would cause incalculable environmental damage. They warned that the vast freshwater wetlands at the mouth of the Ebro could disappear as the silt which maintains the delta became trapped by the dams. The delta's rice farmers said that saltwater would creep inland, ruining their rice fields.

Mr Annan met the Taliban foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, yesterday. Mr Muttawakil said he recognised that the destruction did not help the Taliban's image abroad, but external relations were secondary to religious interests. He said the statues' demolition had begun and all other \"moveable statues\" in Afghanistan had been destroyed. The Taliban said that 59 Buddhist images were destroyed in the national museum in Kabul on February 5 and 6. After yesterday's meeting, Mr Annan said: \"I must say if they do carry through this lamentable decision they will be doing themselves a great deal of disservice. \"I did discuss the statues with the foreign minister and I walked away from the meeting not very encouraged.\" Mr Annan had brought a proposal from the Metropolitan Museum in New York to remove the statues to the US.

Crixivan (indinavir sulfate), which costs around $6,000 (about \u00a34,100) a year in the US, is on offer to sub-Saharan Africa at $600 a year, and Stocrin (efavirenz) at $500. Merck says it will make no profit on the sale. Ivory Coast's minister for Aids, Assana Sangare, said yesterday her country would buy discounted drugs from Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline, bringing the cost of the sort of three-drug combination used to combat HIV/Aids in the west down to around $1,200 a year.</p> <p>The three drug companies, and two others, have in the past offered discounts of 85% but have not named figures. There has been only a limited response. Most of Africa said the prices were still unaffordable. Merck's more generous offer is being seen as a response to the low prices being offered by generics companies, which copy patented drugs. Cipla, the Indian generics company, has said it is willing to supply developing world governments with a cocktail of three Aids drugs for $600 and to drop the price to $350 for the volunteer doctors of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res. The same combination would cost over $10,000 a year in the west.</p> <p>The prices are still too high to allow more than a small number of people to be treated in desperately poor countries. But the real significance of the Merck move is that it signals a downward spiral in drug prices, which looks set to open up the possibility of treatment for millions for whom HIV is now a death sentence.</p> <p>Merck's offer comes within days of the opening and adjournment of a court case brought by 39 international pharmaceutical companies - Merck among them - against the South African government contesting legislation that would allow the import of drugs that are cheaper elsewhere.</p> <p>International outrage over the spectacle of hugely wealthy drug companies trying to stop South Africa's access to cheap medicines has made the case acutely embarrassing for the companies. While they say they must fight on because the legislation in effect sweeps away all their patent rights in South Africa, they are under pressure to improve their public image. GlaxoSmithKline, for instance, has recently announced two malaria initiatives for Africa.</p> <p>Whether or not Merck is trying to draw the sting of the court case, it is certainly motivated by the threat of Cipla walking into the African mar ket. Cipla has asked the South African government to grant it eight compulsory licences for Aids drugs - permission to make a cheap version in South Africa of a patented drug, which is allowable under international trade agreements in cases of dire human need.</p> <p>Merck and the others are signalling that they will do all they can to fight the generics companies off, if not through law then by undercutting their prices.</p> <p>\"I certainly feel that compulsory licences are unneces sary in this case,\" said Jeffrey Sturchio, Merck's executive director for public affairs in Africa. \"We are making these drugs available. We're willing to work with the government in South Africa.\"</p> <p>Those campaigning to get Aids drugs to millions across sub-Saharan Africa are delighted at the price war. \"We think prices can fall further, down to as low as $200 a year for a triple combination,\" said Nathan Ford of MSF. \"For many countries drugs are still, and will be still, too expensive.\"</p>",

In 1986, Covas was one of the main architects of Brazil's return from dictatorship to democracy, and during the 1980s he received what is still the record number of votes for a senator.</p> <p>Since 1994 he had been governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's richest, most populous state. It was only when his health recently deteriorated dramatically that power was transferred to his deputy.</p> <p>Covas stood out in Brazilian politics as a combative, hardworking administrator who preferred to balance books rather than overspend on populist projects. This won him wide-ranging, cross-party respect, although the austerity measures he often had to adopt because of his predecessors' profligacy deprived him of popular affection.</p> <p>Unlike many Brazilian politicians at his level, who often acquire unexplained fortunes during periods in office, and who readily switch convictions and parties, Covas neither personally profited from his positions nor deviated from his centrist political principles. He was a hard-talking, stubborn orator and, as the left-wing leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva observed, he was an example of ethical behaviour, dignity, morality, and of a man who kept his promises.</p> <p>One of the seven founders of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) in 1988, Covas was its candidate for president the following year - the first direct elections for president since the end of the 1964-85 dictatorship. Campaigning on a platform that argued for a \"capitalist shock\", he came fourth.</p> <p>However, after the resignation of President Fernado Collor in a corruption scandal in 1992, the PSDB finally won the presidency in 1994 with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was re-elected in 1998. Covas was the obvious choice for 2002 until he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, shortly after Cardoso's second victory.</p> <p>A coffee broker's son, Covas was born in Santos, a port built on the export of coffee from the interior of south-east Brazil. He began his political career in 1962, entering Congress for the Brazilian Democratic Party. Four years later, as he started his second term, Brazil's new military regime stripped him of his political rights for publicly defending an opponent to the regime. He was briefly imprisoned, but then chose not to go into exile like many of his colleagues but to work as an engineer.</p> <p>He returned to politics in 1979, after a general amnesty, entering Congress for the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. In 1983, he was appointed mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, one of the world's biggest cities, with an inner-city population of 10m.</p> <p>Once the military relinquished power, Covas became majority leader of the Constitutional Assembly, which drew up a new democratic charter. For David Fleischer, a professor of political science at Brasilia University, the constitution was probably Covas's most lasting contribution to Brazil. But he was also, Fleischer suggested, the PSDB's moral conscience, holding it to the straight and narrow and keeping it from alliances with the right. In 1986, Covas was elected to the senate with 7.8m votes.</p> <p>While at the helm of S\u00e3o Paulo state, whose population of 36m makes it as large as a medium-sized country, Covas restored it from near-bankrupcy to financial health. He made tough and unpopular decisions, such as dismissing nearly 200,000 civil servants in 1995. His main political failing was an inability to find solutions to the rapid rise in violent crime.</p> <p>Covas's reputation for courage and transparency was evident in his approach to cancer. By making his struggle public, he won both widespread respect and sympathy.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Lila, and his son and daughter.</p> <p>\u0095 M\u00e1rio Covas, politician, born April 21, 1930; died March 6, 2001 This obituary appeared in the first edition of last Saturday's Guardian</p>",

Covas stood out in Brazilian politics as a combative, hardworking administrator who preferred to balance books rather than overspend on populist projects. This won him wide-ranging, cross-party respect, although the austerity measures he often had to adopt because of his predecessors' profligacy deprived him of popular affection. Unlike many Brazilian politicians at his level, who often acquire unexplained fortunes during periods in office, and who readily switch convictions and parties, Covas neither personally profited from his positions nor deviated from his centrist political principles. He was a hard-talking, stubborn orator and, as the left-wing leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva observed, he was an example of ethical behaviour, dignity, morality, and of a man who kept his promises. One of the seven founders of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) in 1988, Covas was its candidate for president the following year - the first direct elections for president since the end of the 1964-85 dictatorship. Campaigning on a platform that argued for a \"capitalist shock\", he came fourth. However, after the resignation of President Fernado Collor in a corruption scandal in 1992, the PSDB finally won the presidency in 1994 with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was re-elected in 1998. Covas was the obvious choice for 2002 until he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, shortly after Cardoso's second victory. A coffee broker's son, Covas was born in Santos, a port built on the export of coffee from the interior of south-east Brazil. He began his political career in 1962, entering Congress for the Brazilian Democratic Party. Four years later, as he started his second term, Brazil's new military regime stripped him of his political rights for publicly defending an opponent to the regime. He was briefly imprisoned, but then chose not to go into exile like many of his colleagues but to work as an engineer. He returned to politics in 1979, after a general amnesty, entering Congress for the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. In 1983, he was appointed mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, one of the world's biggest cities, with an inner-city population of 10m. Once the military relinquished power, Covas became majority leader of the Constitutional Assembly, which drew up a new democratic charter. For David Fleischer, a professor of political science at Brasilia University, the constitution was probably Covas's most lasting contribution to Brazil. But he was also, Fleischer suggested, the PSDB's moral conscience, holding it to the straight and narrow and keeping it from alliances with the right. In 1986, Covas was elected to the senate with 7.8m votes. While at the helm of S\u00e3o Paulo state, whose population of 36m makes it as large as a medium-sized country, Covas restored it from near-bankrupcy to financial health. He made tough and unpopular decisions, such as dismissing nearly 200,000 civil servants in 1995. His main political failing was an inability to find solutions to the rapid rise in violent crime. Covas's reputation for courage and transparency was evident in his approach to cancer. By making his struggle public, he won both widespread respect and sympathy. He is survived by his wife, Lila, and his son and daughter. \u0095 M\u00e1rio Covas, politician, born April 21, 1930; died March 6, 2001 This obituary appeared in the first edition of last Saturday's Guardian",

      "body": "<p>The Grand Opera House in Belfast shows the exuberance and generosity of spirit of its designer, Frank Matcham. Built in 1895, it is one of 150 theatres that Matcham built throughout Britain, including the Palladium in London. The Belfast opera house is one of the few such buildings left in Britain, having escaped demolition plans in the 1970s and a bombing in 1993. For me, it represents my first taste of serious drama and opera, and it was where, as a boy, I saw Laurel and Hardy. </p> <p>Matcham produced elaborate design on a small scale, while ensuring space for the maximum number of bums on seats. The opera house had to be designed to host a range of events, including opera, variety shows, panto and circus. It is noted for its brilliant acoustics and has been much praised by actors and singers. </p> <p>The plush red velvet and gilt interior have been lovingly restored in a style that manages to combine opulence and practicality. Both the interior and exterior have a wonderful eastern theme. Minarets and golden elephant heads contribute to an enchanting blend of the exotic and the cosy. When I worked for the Arts Council during the 1970s, plans to pull the opera house down and build a multi-storey car park were only narrowly defeated. I see it as one of Belfast's spiritual as well as physical landmarks. It is like a beacon in the city and is a vital part of life here. </p> <p>Tollgate House on Bradbury Place in Belfast is named after a 19th-century toll gate that I used to cycle past when I was a boy. It is a relatively new building, situated on the edge of the Golden Mile area - a rosary of shops, restaurants and bars near the city centre. I see its location - where two main thoroughfares converge - as the southern gateway to the city of Belfast, and it is a shame that such a banal, brutal and depressing pastiche should be built there. </p> <p>There are shops on the ground level and apartments above. The undistinguished exterior is made more drab by the clashing shop-fronts. It is a perfect example of how modern architecture in Belfast is a collection of compromises. There is no daring. It is just like the hundreds and thousands of nondescript, bog-standard constructions all over Britain that are turning our cities into visual deserts. </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Longley's collection of poetry, The Weather in Japan, won the TS Eliot Prize and the Hawthornden Prize this year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Grand Opera House in Belfast shows the exuberance and generosity of spirit of its designer, Frank Matcham. Built in 1895, it is one of 150 theatres that Matcham built throughout Britain, including the Palladium in London. The Belfast opera house is one of the few such buildings left in Britain, having escaped demolition plans in the 1970s and a bombing in 1993. For me, it represents my first taste of serious drama and opera, and it was where, as a boy, I saw Laurel and Hardy. Matcham produced elaborate design on a small scale, while ensuring space for the maximum number of bums on seats. The opera house had to be designed to host a range of events, including opera, variety shows, panto and circus. It is noted for its brilliant acoustics and has been much praised by actors and singers. The plush red velvet and gilt interior have been lovingly restored in a style that manages to combine opulence and practicality. Both the interior and exterior have a wonderful eastern theme. Minarets and golden elephant heads contribute to an enchanting blend of the exotic and the cosy. When I worked for the Arts Council during the 1970s, plans to pull the opera house down and build a multi-storey car park were only narrowly defeated. I see it as one of Belfast's spiritual as well as physical landmarks. It is like a beacon in the city and is a vital part of life here. Tollgate House on Bradbury Place in Belfast is named after a 19th-century toll gate that I used to cycle past when I was a boy. It is a relatively new building, situated on the edge of the Golden Mile area - a rosary of shops, restaurants and bars near the city centre. I see its location - where two main thoroughfares converge - as the southern gateway to the city of Belfast, and it is a shame that such a banal, brutal and depressing pastiche should be built there. There are shops on the ground level and apartments above. The undistinguished exterior is made more drab by the clashing shop-fronts. It is a perfect example of how modern architecture in Belfast is a collection of compromises. There is no daring. It is just like the hundreds and thousands of nondescript, bog-standard constructions all over Britain that are turning our cities into visual deserts. \u0095 Michael Longley's collection of poetry, The Weather in Japan, won the TS Eliot Prize and the Hawthornden Prize this year.",

Anyway, Renee tells us that she was astonished to discover the gluttonous eating habits of her office colleagues. \"The girls all ate cake!\" she cried. Zellweger, Zellweger, of course we eat cake.

Ha ha! Cross your legs, Zellweger). Perhaps the British Cream Cake Foundation (BCCF) could rustle up a survey about the most popular gateau in the nation's publishing offices. The smart money's on the cream horn. </p> <p>Until all the data has been processed, however, we shall have to make do (and it's a pretty poor second, I agree) with a Lloyds TSB survey for the Employers for Work-Life Balance, which has revealed (they are very revealing, these surveys, aren't they?

And heaven only knows you'll be getting enough fractions and numbers-out-of-10s in the rest of Office Hours without WPM adding to them. Oh, all right then it's 70. Seventy per cent of us want a little more flexibility in our working lives. </p> <p>According to the press release on WPM's desk, a more relaxed approach to working hours was particularly popular in the 18-24 age group, who said that it would \"allow them to pursue their life outside work to the full\".

      "body": "<p>The role of office junior, already a thankless job, just got worse. According to the latest salary survey by recruitment consultants Adecco, the average pay for this largely administrative post has fallen by 14.8% over the past year. This is in the face of an increase of 5.4% for the commercial sector as a whole. </p> <p>As if endless coffee-making, photocopying and opening everyone else's post weren't depressing enough, the office junior can now expect just \u00a39,403 for his or her pains. Hardly enough to keep a girl (or boy) in nail varnish and fishnets. </p> <p>Nor are things likely to get any better. According to Diane Bradbury, director of UK operations at Adecco, the pay is slipping because the job is on its way out. There isn't much, it seems, that the office junior can do that a machine can't do better - or at least cheaper. </p> <p>It may not seem like something to cry over. Who, after all, wants to spend their days running errands and grappling with the fax machine? But with the death of the skivvy (sorry, assistant), there dies, too, an established way to break into the workplace. </p> <p>It worked for Beth Clarke, now running a four-person team at a major company. \"I photocopied and opened post for a few months,\" she says. \"Then I got promoted. It was tedious, but it was a way in.\" </p> <p>The alternative is what my friends at Office Angels call \"temp to perm\". And it does exactly what it says on the packet. According to Marcia Roberts, director of external relations at the Recruitment and Employment Corporation, temporary work is a recognised way onto the career ladder. \"It's especially good for graduates with little work experience,\" she says, \"or people returning to work after a career break.\" </p> <p>In other words, if there are gaps in your CV, you have more chance of convincing an employer of your fantastic potential in three weeks of working for them than in five minutes on the other side of a desk. </p> <p>Alex Walters started temping with little secretarial experience, but after six months of various posts, she got lucky at a London-based research house. \"I was meant to be there for a week, as holiday cover,\" she says. \"Then I was asked to stay another couple of days, then another week, and so on, until after four weeks I was offered a job.\" </p> <p> The job was PA to the managing director, with a starting salary of \u00a316,000, which went up again when she was promoted to research assistant. </p> <p>That's not to say that temping doesn't have its downsides. No desk to call your own, no guaranteed salary, new people to impress every week.

      "bodyText": "The role of office junior, already a thankless job, just got worse. According to the latest salary survey by recruitment consultants Adecco, the average pay for this largely administrative post has fallen by 14.8% over the past year. This is in the face of an increase of 5.4% for the commercial sector as a whole. As if endless coffee-making, photocopying and opening everyone else's post weren't depressing enough, the office junior can now expect just \u00a39,403 for his or her pains. Hardly enough to keep a girl (or boy) in nail varnish and fishnets. Nor are things likely to get any better. According to Diane Bradbury, director of UK operations at Adecco, the pay is slipping because the job is on its way out. There isn't much, it seems, that the office junior can do that a machine can't do better - or at least cheaper. It may not seem like something to cry over. Who, after all, wants to spend their days running errands and grappling with the fax machine? But with the death of the skivvy (sorry, assistant), there dies, too, an established way to break into the workplace. It worked for Beth Clarke, now running a four-person team at a major company. \"I photocopied and opened post for a few months,\" she says. \"Then I got promoted. It was tedious, but it was a way in.\" The alternative is what my friends at Office Angels call \"temp to perm\". And it does exactly what it says on the packet. According to Marcia Roberts, director of external relations at the Recruitment and Employment Corporation, temporary work is a recognised way onto the career ladder. \"It's especially good for graduates with little work experience,\" she says, \"or people returning to work after a career break.\" In other words, if there are gaps in your CV, you have more chance of convincing an employer of your fantastic potential in three weeks of working for them than in five minutes on the other side of a desk.

      "body": "<p>It will probably come as something of a surprise to British bosses that many of their PAs harbour a secret desire to leave the company and work for themselves. And temping agencies will be equally amazed to learn just how much of their business these new self-employed secretaries intend to take. </p> <p>\"I have just had a City company call me, absolutely horrified to discover that all four of its top secretaries had applied to join us,\" reports Bridget Postlethwaite of the International Association of Virtual Assistants (IAVA), Britain's newest and biggest cooperative body for administrators. City companies should take heed of this news, as it reflects the world's latest big move in business administration. </p> <p>A Virtual Assistant (VA) is a top-level secretary who has had enough of office regimes and sells her skills from her home office. She is the freelance gunslinger of the admin world, already taking administrative business in shovelfuls, mainly from small and medium-sized companies. </p> <p>\"Corporations haven't quite realised how much better off they are with a VA rather than a temp,\" says Postlethwaite. \"The reason temps are notoriously ineffective is not because of personal skills, but because they are badly briefed and managed - the first two hours of any Monday morning are wasted in working out who she is going to work for, and how. Eight VAs will probably do the work of 20 temps, and I've had a client tell me that I did in two days what his entire pool took a week to do.\" </p> <p>Big businesses have a tendency to envisage VAs as \"home typists\", without realising that they do not come from the typing pool. Most VAs have already risen to the top of the administrative profession - as smaller companies have realised. Says Postlethwaite: \"They know that paying a VA by the hour gets them the kind of professional PA that corporations pay \u00a330,000 for.\" </p> <p>The rise of the VA is worldwide. Chris Durst in Connecticut has been credited with starting the industry, and her Staffcentrix cooperative has more than 1,000 members in 27 countries, including around 60 in Britain. In Maryland, Stacy Brice of Assist-U created the first American \"university\" to prepare PAs for self-employment, and she brings her service here at Easter. In Australia, Kathie Thomas founded Clayton's Secretary, without knowing that other VAs existed, and now she, too, has British members. </p> <p>The move is driven by PAs themselves. Last year, after two press articles in 48 hours, IAVA had 500 enquiries and 27,000 visitors to the website in one week. Today, it has 315 members, and 800 ask for advice on a casual basis. Chris Durst at Staffcentrix polled her members and discovered that 66% had been in business for less than a year, or were preparing to make the leap . There is, she concluded, a vast underswell of PAs on the move, building up part-time VA businesses as they prepare to leave the safety of the paycheque behind. </p> <p>Everyday administrative work is at the heart of the industry, but the average VA can handle anything, from anywhere. Postlethwaite transfers stocks and shares, works for someone in prison who writes once a week with the jobs he wants done, handles website updates for an estate agent on a guaranteed 24-hour basis, and takes \"virtual bookings\" for two hairdressers, without the clients realising that she isn't their receptionist. </p> <p>Internet research and website maintenance are becoming big earners, reports Chris Durst. \"Software packages have made site-building simple, so web design is not getting the fees it used to, but keeping a site fresh is both critical and time- consuming, and our VAs indicate fees of more than $US35 (about \u00a320) an hour.\" </p> <p>This is a fair average. The British VA rates average \u00a315 an hour, rising to \u00a325 in London. For the employer, this is economical, producing top-level staff without overheads - the manager just picks the VA with the right skills, and if she's the wrong one, he can change instantly. </p> <p>Location is irrelevant. From a Channel Islands base, Postlethwaite can work for clients anywhere. Kathie Thomas in Australia gives a classic example. She heard an American client complain about the time taken by transcribers in Paris, and taught him to email his dictation as an audiofile overnight from France to Australia. Because of the difference in time zones, he can now send a day's work off around the world, and by the time he wakes in the morning, the transcriptions are back on his desk. </p> <p>Stacey Brice of Assist-U says that 400 experienced secretaries have now passed through her extremely testing 20-week course. \"Many think of us as a finishing school. The people we train are already great administrative professionals who, tired of being abused, disrespected and underpaid, have simply had enough. We know how to show them to use their skills and do the work they love, but never again have to be in that position.\" </p> <p>For the VA, the loneliness of self-employment rarely exists. The British IAVA has a group email in which a simple query, such as \"How do I lock a cell in Excel?\", will get an answer from someone immediately. More common is: \"I've received a job in a format I can't read - will someone reformat it for me and send it back?\", and Postlethwaite has even been loaned a PC on a Saturday night to help her finish a rush job. </p> <p>In spite of this, the image of the \"home typist\" endures. Only this month, the legendary American advice columnist \"Dear Abby\" answered a VA whose clients think that a \"home office\" means they can bring their children when dropping in work. Doing the work was hard enough, she protested, without having clients' kids switching off her PC in mid-program and spilling Coke into the keyboard. </p> <p>The upside of that, laughs Suzie Warren of Spectrumadmin at Bordon in Hampshire, is that she can now deal with her bank manager while still in her pyjamas. \"Prospective clients all say what a wonderful idea it is, although they're most definitely wary of it . . . until they try it, which is when they get hooked and start talking about it, which is fine for us. </p> <p>\"That's how I got started - I was an inhouse PA, and now the chap I was working for has decided to keep me, on my terms. I now look after several businessmen and women instead of one, and the reason this is a wonderful trade to be in is because there are no boundaries. One client lives in Salisbury and works in Milton Keynes, so it doesn't matter where his PA is - and it doesn't even matter that he's about to go and work in the Netherlands, because he can remain my client.\" </p> <p>Suzie has been an IAVA member since September. \"This is the very best time to launch yourself as a VA,\" she says. \"The market is full of interested listeners, but it isn't yet crowded enough to be too competitive.\" </p> <p>IAVA: tel: 01481 824825; <a href=\"http://www.iava.org.uk\">www.iava.org.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>New powers allowing credit unions to make larger loans for longer periods will be unveiled by the Treasury this morning as part of its attempt to tackle the thorny issue of financial exclusion. </p> <p>The move means that credit unions will be granted greater flexibility in handing out loans and taking in deposits from savers six months earlier than initially planned by the government. </p> <p>Melanie Johnson, economic secretary to the Treasury, will use the changes to the rules governing credit unions to try to promote the government's goal of creating more of these institutions across the country. </p> <p>The government hopes that the longer period of loans - up to 12 years in some cases -may make it easier for people to buy homes. </p> <p>The government is aiming to increase the penetration of credit unions to levels reached in other countries, particularly Ireland where 40% of the population are members of such unions. </p> <p>Attempts to foster growth are under way. High street banks are helping to run credit unions while the recent report into the future of the cooperative movement conluded that one of the areas for potential expansion was credit unions. </p> <p>But, the rigid rules setting out the amount of lending credit unions are able to do were said by some industry experts to be inhibiting their development. </p> <p>Ms Johnson hopes that by reducing the restrictions, more credit unions may be started. </p> <p>From April 1, credit unions will be able to make unsecured loans for three years - rather than the current two - and secured loans, such as those for a house, for seven years rather than five. Some secured loans from credit unions which are able to meet tougher financial rules may also be made for 12 years, up from 10 years. </p> <p>Under the changes, people under the age of 18 will also be able to increase the amount of money they save with credit unions to \u00a35,000 from \u00a3750. This means they will be able to save as much as adults. </p> <p>When it took office four years ago, the government pledged to tackle the issue of financial exclusion. It set up a task force on credit unions and, more controversially, has encouraged financial firms to contribute to the cost of setting up a post office-based bank to be known as Universal Banking Services. </p> <p>The new credit union rules are in addition to measures which have already been introduced in the new Financial Services and Markets Act which will result in the financial services authority receiving new powers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "New powers allowing credit unions to make larger loans for longer periods will be unveiled by the Treasury this morning as part of its attempt to tackle the thorny issue of financial exclusion. The move means that credit unions will be granted greater flexibility in handing out loans and taking in deposits from savers six months earlier than initially planned by the government. Melanie Johnson, economic secretary to the Treasury, will use the changes to the rules governing credit unions to try to promote the government's goal of creating more of these institutions across the country. The government hopes that the longer period of loans - up to 12 years in some cases -may make it easier for people to buy homes. The government is aiming to increase the penetration of credit unions to levels reached in other countries, particularly Ireland where 40% of the population are members of such unions. Attempts to foster growth are under way. High street banks are helping to run credit unions while the recent report into the future of the cooperative movement conluded that one of the areas for potential expansion was credit unions. But, the rigid rules setting out the amount of lending credit unions are able to do were said by some industry experts to be inhibiting their development. Ms Johnson hopes that by reducing the restrictions, more credit unions may be started. From April 1, credit unions will be able to make unsecured loans for three years - rather than the current two - and secured loans, such as those for a house, for seven years rather than five. Some secured loans from credit unions which are able to meet tougher financial rules may also be made for 12 years, up from 10 years. Under the changes, people under the age of 18 will also be able to increase the amount of money they save with credit unions to \u00a35,000 from \u00a3750. This means they will be able to save as much as adults. When it took office four years ago, the government pledged to tackle the issue of financial exclusion. It set up a task force on credit unions and, more controversially, has encouraged financial firms to contribute to the cost of setting up a post office-based bank to be known as Universal Banking Services. The new credit union rules are in addition to measures which have already been introduced in the new Financial Services and Markets Act which will result in the financial services authority receiving new powers.",

More than half the partners of people who work in excess of 48 hours in a typical week admit that it is damaging their sex life. A further third of partners claim that long hours have a negative effect on their personal relationships generally. </p> <p>\"While working long hours doesn't necessarily lead to marriage breakdown, it can put a strain on relationships with partners, children and friends,\" says Melissa Compton-Edwards, the report's author. For instance, 43% of partners claim they are fed up with having to shoulder the domestic burden. </p> <p>And, she warns, don't assume you'd know if your partner was among them. \"Long-suffering spouses and cohabiting partners tend to suffer in silence, tolerating the situation and trying to curb their criticism of their absentee other half. The Faustian pact seems to be that while they would rather their 'long hours' partner worked shorter hours, this is considered a price worth paying if it guarantees a decent living standard.\" </p> <p>You may be equally in the dark when it comes to children or friends who feel undervalued, she says. \"The culture of presenteeism means many individuals subconsciously expect people who work to have struck the wrong work-life balance.\" </p> <p>According to careers consultancy Sanders &amp; Sydney, it isn't only long hours that are responsible for the growing wedge between employees and their loved ones. \"Our research shows that the vast majority of our friends are now made at work and that friendship, like pay and benefits, is becoming key in attracting and binding us to an organisation,\" says Sanders &amp; Sydney director Sally Davis. The result, not surprisingly, is that employees spend more time at work, or at least with their workmates, and existing friends may consequently be disregarded. \"We are increasingly reliant on the workplace to provide our sense of belonging,\" adds Davis. </p> <p>The research found that employers are increasingly aware of the importance of a workplace community in influencing someone's decision to join an organisation, to stay with it, and to commit more to his or her work. In other words, they are employing people whom they predict will form strong bonds. </p> <p>\"It is part of our vision to develop a sense of community in all departments - with a focus on fun and socialising,\" says Mike Deohane, HR director at AWG, the former water utility Anglian Water. Hey presto, you have more of a laugh by the photocopier or in the work bar than you do down the pub or at home. </p> <p>Other companies are introducing \"corporate villages\", which can result in employees not wanting to leave their self-sufficient workplaces. After all, why go home when work provides an on-site jogging trail, top-quality restaurants, massages at your desk, TV rooms and free counselling? Consider British Airways' \u00a3200m state-of-the-art Waterside business centre near Heathrow. Paul Parry, who was involved in the project from the start, explains: \"Six four-storey buildings, each with an individually styled courtyard, are arranged on either side of a long, glazed atrium, known as 'The Street'.

This programme by the Britten Sinfonia (of which he is president) spotlighted his own works alongside a few by composers that have inspired him. As Bennett himself admitted, it was all \"slightly self-indulgent\", but then indulging composers is not always a crime, and nobody could begrudge this ebullient and enjoyable tribute to a musician who remains impossible to categorise. </p> <p>Although Bennett has carved out a presence in the worlds of \"serious\" and \"light\" classical music as well as jazz, it can't be said that he is equally at home in all three of them. The first of his own works on this programme (which opened with a Fantasia by Purcell) was the Nocturnes for Chamber Orchestra (1963), an early composition influenced by the unlikely combination of the intellectualism of his teacher Pierre Boulez and the warmth of his mentor Elisabeth Lutyens. In these three pieces Bennett employed the 12-note technique, but one could always hear his own love of lyricism trying to push through the serialist net. He used the modernist musical language with competence, yet the Nocturnes left the impression that it was not Bennett's mother tongue. </p> <p>Next to these pieces, the 1995 Partita made his later departure into the world of light classical music seem less a foray than a homecoming. Bennett has a rare talent for writing scores that, despite being the classical equivalent of easy listening, largely avoid getting bogged down in cliche and schmaltz. Although written in memory of a close friend, the outer movements of the Partita are celebratory, recalling Walton's film music or even Stravinsky; it is only the extended Lullaby between them that hints at a feeling of loss. Under Nicholas Cleobury's solid yet buoyant conducting, the Sinfonia's lively playing conveyed their own enjoyment of the score. </p> <p>Nicholas Daniel's oboe is a distinctive and dominant feature of the Sinfonia at any time; as soloist in Bennett's new work, Seven Country Dances, he was as eloquent and persuasive as ever. Bennett's settings of these folksy tunes at times verges on the formulaic, and the pastoral harmonies owe much to Vaughan Williams, but nonetheless they have a deft, imaginative polish that is all his own. </p> <p>Bennett joined the orchestra as pianist for Aaron Jay Kernis's vivid orchestrations of three of Debussy's piano preludes, an unexpected treat. The lights reddened for the final items, doing their best to turn this staid hall into a cabaret venue as a jazz trio further augmented the Sinfonia for some of Bennett's film music and arrangements. An encore of Sinatra's In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning finally revealed Richard Rodney Bennett the jazz singer, crooning like his namesake Tony - yet another face of this many-sided, multi-talented musician. </p>",

Under Nicholas Cleobury's solid yet buoyant conducting, the Sinfonia's lively playing conveyed their own enjoyment of the score. Nicholas Daniel's oboe is a distinctive and dominant feature of the Sinfonia at any time; as soloist in Bennett's new work, Seven Country Dances, he was as eloquent and persuasive as ever. Bennett's settings of these folksy tunes at times verges on the formulaic, and the pastoral harmonies owe much to Vaughan Williams, but nonetheless they have a deft, imaginative polish that is all his own. Bennett joined the orchestra as pianist for Aaron Jay Kernis's vivid orchestrations of three of Debussy's piano preludes, an unexpected treat. The lights reddened for the final items, doing their best to turn this staid hall into a cabaret venue as a jazz trio further augmented the Sinfonia for some of Bennett's film music and arrangements. An encore of Sinatra's In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning finally revealed Richard Rodney Bennett the jazz singer, crooning like his namesake Tony - yet another face of this many-sided, multi-talented musician.",

The first profits at the operation, where AMP of Australia and Royal Bank of Scotland also have stakes, come after Virgin One doubled its business in 2000 as customers became used to its all-in-one current account and mortgage product. Virgin One said yesterday it had taken 3.5% of all the new mortgage business in the country last year as a result of the account, which allows holders to over-or underpay their mortgages as their circumstances allow. A spokesman for Virgin One refused to reveal the extent of the business's losses in 2000 but insisted that this time next year it would be making a profit.

The company has devised a service it has named \"v-safe\" which pulls together information about all the different accounts an individual runs on-line and presents it on a single web page.

      "byline": "Mike Emmott",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Employment lawyers are on a roll. Every month - every day almost - brings the announcement of new employment rights. From working time regulations to part-time working, from union recognition to paternity leave, the ingenuity of the lawmakers in Brussels and at Westminster is harnessed to the cause of employment protection. </p> <p>What is going to stem the flow? This is not primarily a legal or even a political question. It would be unsafe to assume that either politicians or lawyers will set out to establish the limits on employment law. On present trends, it seems likely to be the machinery for enforcement that will reveal the fault-lines in our approach to employment regulation. </p> <p>When employment tribunals were established in the 1960s, they were seen as a mechanism for resolving workplace issues that would be informal, speedy and inexpensive. The subsequent expansion in the scale of employment legislation, and increasing dependence on legal representation by both employer and applicant, have undermined this aspiration. </p> <p>The spiralling numbers of claims to tribunals - 118,000 in the past year - reflect the extension of their jurisdiction to support new employment rights. Employer concerns focus on the costs involved in defending claims. DTI figures show that tribunal cases cost employers more than \u00a32,000 as long ago as 1992. Many employers today will be paying several times that figure. </p> <p>Even if cases do not proceed to a hearing, employers will generally have incurred significant costs in collecting evidence and taking legal advice. They may be bombarded by requests for documentation whose relevance to the claim remains unclear. This may sometimes be no more than a tactic by lawyers engaged on a \"no win, no fee\" basis to put pressure on employers to settle. </p> <p>But unhappiness with the volume of cases is not limited to employers. Many trade unions are also feeling the strain of servicing claims by members, and would be happy if their numbers could be reduced. The average compensation award in unfair dismissal cases is only about \u00a32,500. Three-quarters of employees who make claims never get to a tribunal hearing at all, but withdraw their claim or accept a compromise offer from the employer. Claimants are in any case highly unlikely to get their job back; reinstatement or re-engagement is awarded in only a handful of cases. </p> <p>In practice, tribunal claims look increasingly like part of a \"compensation culture\", in which employees who lose their job often have little to lose by claiming - but not much real benefit from winning either. </p> <p>So what can be done? </p> <p>When the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, announced his intention recently to increase the level of costs tribunals can impose on \"unreasonable\" claimants, he got some predictable responses. Unions accused the government of pandering to whingeing employers, while the CBI welcomed the proposals. </p> <p>Both reactions are based on an exaggerated view of the impact the changes are likely to have. Similar efforts to discourage weak cases in the past have had little effect. This is not least because tribunals are reluctant to behave in what might look to be a heavy-handed way towards individuals who claim to be exercising their statutory rights. </p> <p>Mr Byers' proposals may represent a last throw at \"mending\" the system. If, as seems likely, they have at most a limited impact, more radical solutions will need to be considered. What might they look like? </p> <p>Acas, the advisory, conciliation and arbitration service, is expected to introduce a scheme under which unfair dismissal claims can be resolved by arbitration if both parties agree. This approach looks fairly close to the original conception of tribunals as informal labour courts. The scheme has, however, been held up for technical reasons. Doubts have also been expressed about how far it will reduce the number of hearings, and how far it will simply suck in cases that are currently resolved by agreement. </p> <p>More could be done to promote the use of in-house procedures. Although most employers already have some form of grievance procedure, there is no statutory requirement for this. More effective in-house procedures could significantly reduce the number of claims to tribunals. Indeed, if employers were required to have such procedures it would not seem unreasonable to require employees to have exhausted them before making a tribunal claim. </p> <p>This is the kind of agenda that needs to be addressed, and sooner rather than later. Failure to stem the tide of employer unhappiness with the growing burden of tribunal claims will only increase resistance to the ever-expanding \"minimum rights\" agenda. This is no criticism of the people who serve as tribunal chairmen and members, who exercise their statutory functions in what is generally seen as a fair-minded and impartial way. </p> <p>Curiously, no comprehensive evaluation of the costs and benefits of the employment tribunal system has ever been undertaken. Rather than simply tinkering at the edges, the government should announce its intention to undertake a really radical review of the tribunal system. </p> <p>\u0095 Mike Emmott is an adviser on employee relations at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Employment lawyers are on a roll. Every month - every day almost - brings the announcement of new employment rights. From working time regulations to part-time working, from union recognition to paternity leave, the ingenuity of the lawmakers in Brussels and at Westminster is harnessed to the cause of employment protection. What is going to stem the flow? This is not primarily a legal or even a political question. It would be unsafe to assume that either politicians or lawyers will set out to establish the limits on employment law. On present trends, it seems likely to be the machinery for enforcement that will reveal the fault-lines in our approach to employment regulation. When employment tribunals were established in the 1960s, they were seen as a mechanism for resolving workplace issues that would be informal, speedy and inexpensive. The subsequent expansion in the scale of employment legislation, and increasing dependence on legal representation by both employer and applicant, have undermined this aspiration. The spiralling numbers of claims to tribunals - 118,000 in the past year - reflect the extension of their jurisdiction to support new employment rights. Employer concerns focus on the costs involved in defending claims. DTI figures show that tribunal cases cost employers more than \u00a32,000 as long ago as 1992. Many employers today will be paying several times that figure. Even if cases do not proceed to a hearing, employers will generally have incurred significant costs in collecting evidence and taking legal advice. They may be bombarded by requests for documentation whose relevance to the claim remains unclear. This may sometimes be no more than a tactic by lawyers engaged on a \"no win, no fee\" basis to put pressure on employers to settle. But unhappiness with the volume of cases is not limited to employers. Many trade unions are also feeling the strain of servicing claims by members, and would be happy if their numbers could be reduced. The average compensation award in unfair dismissal cases is only about \u00a32,500. Three-quarters of employees who make claims never get to a tribunal hearing at all, but withdraw their claim or accept a compromise offer from the employer. Claimants are in any case highly unlikely to get their job back; reinstatement or re-engagement is awarded in only a handful of cases. In practice, tribunal claims look increasingly like part of a \"compensation culture\", in which employees who lose their job often have little to lose by claiming - but not much real benefit from winning either. So what can be done? When the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, announced his intention recently to increase the level of costs tribunals can impose on \"unreasonable\" claimants, he got some predictable responses. Unions accused the government of pandering to whingeing employers, while the CBI welcomed the proposals. Both reactions are based on an exaggerated view of the impact the changes are likely to have. Similar efforts to discourage weak cases in the past have had little effect. This is not least because tribunals are reluctant to behave in what might look to be a heavy-handed way towards individuals who claim to be exercising their statutory rights. Mr Byers' proposals may represent a last throw at \"mending\" the system. If, as seems likely, they have at most a limited impact, more radical solutions will need to be considered. What might they look like? Acas, the advisory, conciliation and arbitration service, is expected to introduce a scheme under which unfair dismissal claims can be resolved by arbitration if both parties agree. This approach looks fairly close to the original conception of tribunals as informal labour courts. The scheme has, however, been held up for technical reasons. Doubts have also been expressed about how far it will reduce the number of hearings, and how far it will simply suck in cases that are currently resolved by agreement. More could be done to promote the use of in-house procedures. Although most employers already have some form of grievance procedure, there is no statutory requirement for this. More effective in-house procedures could significantly reduce the number of claims to tribunals. Indeed, if employers were required to have such procedures it would not seem unreasonable to require employees to have exhausted them before making a tribunal claim. This is the kind of agenda that needs to be addressed, and sooner rather than later. Failure to stem the tide of employer unhappiness with the growing burden of tribunal claims will only increase resistance to the ever-expanding \"minimum rights\" agenda. This is no criticism of the people who serve as tribunal chairmen and members, who exercise their statutory functions in what is generally seen as a fair-minded and impartial way. Curiously, no comprehensive evaluation of the costs and benefits of the employment tribunal system has ever been undertaken. Rather than simply tinkering at the edges, the government should announce its intention to undertake a really radical review of the tribunal system. \u0095 Mike Emmott is an adviser on employee relations at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.",
