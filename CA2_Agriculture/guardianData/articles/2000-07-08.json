      "body": "<p>The day is approaching - 1 August is designated 'dump the pump' day, when the nation's motorists can collectively signal their anger at high petrol prices by boycotting petrol stations. I doubt there'll be less traffic - we will fill up the day before - but the sight of deserted filling stations and the prospect of more boycotts thereafter is meant to show the country, media and the Government the degree to which motorists have had enough. You will have to make your mind up. Are you going to use a petrol station on 1 August - and earn the wrath of the Sun and Mail, now in full, awesome campaigning mode - or not?</p> <p>My guess is that 1 August will be a moderate success. It's not been much reported, but the world is experiencing a fourth, mini oil shock. Prices have trebled over the last 18 months in response to production cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, driving up petrol by 20 pence a litre, but unlike the last three oil shocks petrol duty is very much higher - twice as high in real terms as it was in 1974 and 1979, and two- thirds higher than it was in 1990. The result is that pump prices are approaching the dreaded \u00a31 a litre, although if the oil price can be prevented from rising above $30 a barrel, which the Saudi Arabians are ardently attempting by unilaterally signalling further production increases, then the danger could be averted for the moment. That's too fine a point for most British motorists - they're mad enough already.</p> <p>For on top of that 20p increase in the underlying petrol price has come another 20p rise in petrol duty since 1993 (6p of it since Labour took power in 1997). The policy of ratcheting up duties faster than inflation was started by the Tories and, until the last Budget, had been continued by Gordon Brown. To Ken Clarke, it seemed a politically risk-free way of closing the budget deficit under the guise of meeting internationally agreed targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. As an expedient when oil was cheap, it worked, but Opec has put an end to that, and New Labour is paying the political price for motorists having to pay \u00a350 to fill their tank.</p> <p>The accusation from the Sun, Mail and the motoring organisations that the Government is chiefly responsible for the motorists' plight is largely disingenuous; even if New Labour had frozen petrol duties when it reached office, petrol would only be 6p a litre cheaper. Opec and the Tories have done for the motorist. But what the 'dump the pump' campaign is highlighting is the long-standing failure of British policy makers to get to grips with the transport question, the disgraceful refusal to accept that modern life depends on mobility and that there are unacceptable and undesirable consequences of high petrol prices. We are reaching the limits of what ordinary people can pay for transport relative to their other spending. Rail fares have risen by more than 70 per cent in real terms over the last 25 years; bus fares by more than 50 per cent. Using a car now is becoming seriously expensive. Small wonder transport is becoming a hot political issue.</p> <p>You may, as an Observer reader, be wary of the Mail, but when it writes, as it did last week, that Brown would have some excuse for high petrol duties if he had been investing in a first-class public transport system, you can only agree. Indeed, the signs are that he agrees; under pressure, the Government is saying that the Comprehensive Spending Review is set to announce a major increase in transport investment.</p> <p>In the meantime, we are grappling with the here-and-now impact of a trebling of the oil price overlaid on the steep increase in duties over the 1990s. It is no accident that the last three oil shocks were all accompanied by recessions; it is very hard, indeed almost impossible, for businesses and individuals to change their demand for energy and fuel in the short run. Company profits are hit as companies absorb the increased fuel costs and consumer demand falls away as more disposable income is diverted to meeting fuel and petrol bills. Unless there is a compensating increase in demand through interest rate cuts, tax reductions or increased public spending, the first-round impact of high oil prices is deflationary.</p> <p>Thus some of the arguments deployed by the 'dump the pump' campaigners are rooted in real economic concerns. Intriguingly, after both the 1970's oil shocks, Old Labour's reaction was to cushion the impact by allowing petrol duty to fall about a quarter in real terms by not lifting it in line with the very high inflation rates of the time - equivalent today to around a 12p cut in duty. Today's oil price increase is nothing like so recessionary, but the case for some reduction - or at least no further increase in duty - is pretty persuasive. There are telling signs of economic distress - not least the reaction to the campaign - and it was important last week that the Bank of England did not lift interest rates.</p> <p>But the notion of cutting duty seems silly both environmentally and in transport terms; after all, we want to deter car use, don't we? But some brutal realities need to be recognised. The rise in duties over the 1990s has done little or nothing to deter car use. A superb paper by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, forbiddingly entitled 'The Distributional Effects of Taxes on Private Motoring', shows how we are using the car more, notwithstanding higher petrol prices. We regard car use as a necessity, and there is only a tiny measurable deterrent-effect from higher petrol prices. However, the rich and poor pay the same duty, so that for any given duty increase the poorest 10 per cent of car owners suffer more than twice the impact on their living standards as the richest 10 per cent.</p> <p>So it has not been high petrol prices that have brought about the fall in emissions of pollutants over the last few years as car use has intensified; that has been almost entirely due to better engines and compulsory use of catalytic converters in new cars. If we want to tackle congestion, we have to find ways of persuading people to think of their car as less of a necessity - and that means much better and efficient public transport together with a more effective system of deterring car use at peak times, such as congestion charges or tolls. As matters stand, we have a regressive and ineffective tax on essential car use, a poor road system and second-rate public transport - the worst of all worlds.</p> <p>So a lot hangs on the Comprehensive Spending Review in a fortnight's time. If there really is a decisive increase in public transport investment and a convincing transport policy, then the 'dump the pump' campaign will have been trumped by events. If not, we should all join in.</p>",

So it has not been high petrol prices that have brought about the fall in emissions of pollutants over the last few years as car use has intensified; that has been almost entirely due to better engines and compulsory use of catalytic converters in new cars. If we want to tackle congestion, we have to find ways of persuading people to think of their car as less of a necessity - and that means much better and efficient public transport together with a more effective system of deterring car use at peak times, such as congestion charges or tolls. As matters stand, we have a regressive and ineffective tax on essential car use, a poor road system and second-rate public transport - the worst of all worlds. So a lot hangs on the Comprehensive Spending Review in a fortnight's time. If there really is a decisive increase in public transport investment and a convincing transport policy, then the 'dump the pump' campaign will have been trumped by events. If not, we should all join in.",

      "bodyText": "The IRA's Belfast Brigade will have to decommission its suntan lotion and forget about a summer holiday, thanks to a light-fingered comrade. For a former IRA activist from East Belfast, in charge of the Provos' punishment beatings, has made off with almost \u00a3100,000 from the terror group's war chest. The ex-prisoner from the Catholic enclave, the Short Strand, pinched the Provo loot which had been set aside to pay for holidays and short breaks for IRA volunteers in the city. The Provos only found out that their long-standing comrade had stolen the cash when they interrogated his sister, also from the Short Strand. According to republican sources, she was given \u00a310,000 by her brother to keep quiet about the theft. But when she started spending large amounts of cash the IRA became suspicious and hauled her in. The \u00a3100,000, mostly earned from selling cigarettes illegally smuggled from Spain, was hidden under floorboards in her house. The IRA threatened to shoot her unless she told them where her brother and his family had fled. She revealed that he was in the United States. 'They tried to contact him but he's not coming home,' said an RUC source. 'And who would blame him?' The ex-IRA man is known as 'Big A'. For several years he has been involved in so-called punishment beatings and shootings in the Short Strand and Markets areas close to Belfast city centre. Big A has carried out many beatings and mutilations of young men accused by IRA kangaroo courts of joyriding, drug dealing and burglary. A number of his victims threw parties last weekend to celebrate Big A's fall from grace.",

But not for long. Public Netbase, which provides Internet facilities for more than 1,200 cultural and political projects, has had its public funding stopped and been told to get out of the building by April next year.</p> <p>Konrad Becker, one of the founders of Public Netbase, says his organisation is only one of many cultural institutions to face closure because they are judged by the government, which includes J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom Party, to be on the wrong side of the political tracks.</p> <p>'As soon as the new government came into place, all project money was immediately withdrawn. They don't even talk to us now,' Becker said.</p> <p>Austrian artists, journalists and intellectuals describe a climate of fear and intimidation that they believe is part of a government attempt to silence opposition to the coalition government that has become the pariah of European politics.</p> <p>Journalists on the public service television channel \u00d6RF have been threatened with dismissal for being too critical of the government and some coalition politicians have called for weekly demonstrations in the centre of Vienna to be banned.</p> <p>Later this week the president of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will nominate three 'wise men' to monitor Austria's treatment of minorities, immigrants and asylum-seekers and assess the evolution of the 'political nature' of the Freedom Party.</p> <p>If the report is favourable, Austria's 14 EU partners will lift the sanctions imposed in protest against the presence in government of Haider's party.</p> <p>Among the cases the wise men may care to examine is that of Anton Pelinka, Austria's most distinguished political scientist, who was convicted in a Vienna court in April of defaming Haider by accusing him of trivialising National Socialism. Pelinka, who is appealing against the verdict, claims that Haider is using the libel laws to silence his critics.</p> <p>'Less privileged people than me will consider very carefully what they say in future.

      "bodyText": "In a few sparsely furnished rooms in Vienna's former imperial stables, a handful of artists and political activists are taking the opposition to Austria's right-wing government into cyberspace. But not for long. Public Netbase, which provides Internet facilities for more than 1,200 cultural and political projects, has had its public funding stopped and been told to get out of the building by April next year. Konrad Becker, one of the founders of Public Netbase, says his organisation is only one of many cultural institutions to face closure because they are judged by the government, which includes J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom Party, to be on the wrong side of the political tracks. 'As soon as the new government came into place, all project money was immediately withdrawn. They don't even talk to us now,' Becker said. Austrian artists, journalists and intellectuals describe a climate of fear and intimidation that they believe is part of a government attempt to silence opposition to the coalition government that has become the pariah of European politics. Journalists on the public service television channel \u00d6RF have been threatened with dismissal for being too critical of the government and some coalition politicians have called for weekly demonstrations in the centre of Vienna to be banned. Later this week the president of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will nominate three 'wise men' to monitor Austria's treatment of minorities, immigrants and asylum-seekers and assess the evolution of the 'political nature' of the Freedom Party. If the report is favourable, Austria's 14 EU partners will lift the sanctions imposed in protest against the presence in government of Haider's party. Among the cases the wise men may care to examine is that of Anton Pelinka, Austria's most distinguished political scientist, who was convicted in a Vienna court in April of defaming Haider by accusing him of trivialising National Socialism. Pelinka, who is appealing against the verdict, claims that Haider is using the libel laws to silence his critics. 'Less privileged people than me will consider very carefully what they say in future. Because they don't want to spend five years in the courts until Strasbourg proves them right,' Pelinka said. Austria's Foreign Minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, last week dismissed the furore over Pelinka as a political interpretation of a private, legal matter. 'We have independent courts and maybe this was not a very fantastic judgement. But who are we to judge that?' she said. But other Austrian intellectuals claim that there is a pattern in the government's behaviour, and Walter Famler, who edits the literary magazine Wespennest (Wasps' Nest) says that the Pelinka case ought to ring alarm bells about the coalition's intentions. 'They really want to destroy the public standing of people like Pelinka with every means they can find. The hardcore Nazis in Germany threaten people with violence. Here they want to corrupt people,' Famler said. Ferrero-Waldner argues that, as the new government prunes back its public spending, everyone's budget is being cut and that most of the complaints by disgruntled artists and intellectuals are nothing more than the predictable gripes of disappointed people. But many of the casualties of the cuts, from community radio stations to independent theatre groups, have one thing in common - their opposition to the government. And while Ferrero-Waldner claims that her government's attempts to effect changes in political programming on television are aimed at creating more objectivity and efficiency, all the journalists who are being targeted are critical of the coalition. Although the Foreign Minister does not favour a ban on the demonstrations against her government that attract thousands each Thursday evening, she suggested that groups taking part in the protests could see their state subsidies disappear. 'The demonstrations can go on forever, but on the other hand I think it's also a question sometimes of subsidies. Because these people have their stands here and so on. Maybe they get the money from somewhere. I don't know,' Ferrero-Waldner said. In the past, many independent cultural groups topped up their budgets and broadened their intellectual horizons by touring abroad, but Austria's current status as an international pariah has meant that many invitations have been cancelled and most groups are staying at home this summer. Combined with the budget cuts, the international boycott of Austria's independent voices represents a double blow. 'Nobody's called us from Western Europe at all this year. But maybe we'll go to Skopje in October - that will be our international tour,' said Baertl Gstetner, who runs Tanzhotel, a pioneering modern dance group in Vienna. Becker has given up hope of receiving any more public funding for Public Netbase, and as he watches the progress of Austria's new government he believes that he underestimated the threat to free speech. 'At the beginning, we were all quite happy to see a mobilisation of the public and it was very impressive to see so many people on the streets,' Becker said. 'But I'm very much afraid if this goes on for a long time. Austria doesn't have a very big tradition of dissenting democratic structures, and I'm very worried about the consequences,' he said.

      "body": "<p>Don Brind was at home watching the tennis when the phone rang. It was Saturday evening and the Labour Party official was on duty to field calls from journalists following up stories appearing in the next day's newspapers.</p> <p>On the other end of the phone was Bob Roberts, deputy political editor of the Press Association. Was Brind aware, Roberts asked, of a story appearing in the next day's Observer based on an article written by Ken Follett, the author who had helped to raise millions for New Labour?</p> <p>Brind wasn't. Roberts had received a press release from the Observer detailing Follett's allegation that Blair was guilty of making 'malicious gossip an everyday tool of modern British government'. Alastair Campbell, Blair's official spokesman, was also at home that night. Brind faxed him the release. Campbell read it and decided attack was the best form of defence. They put together a statement saying Follett was a man 'better known for his fiction than his judgment'. It was the start of a week that many have described as the worst seven days Blair has faced in government.</p> <p>Leaked memos revealed splits at the heart of government over the euro; police criticised plans over spot-fines for drunken yobs; Blair's performance at Prime Minister's Questions was described as lamentable; his son was found drunk in a gutter.</p> <p>So was this the beginning of the end of the Blair soap opera? Will the events of the past week finally force the real Blair to stand up, free of the spin doctors and advisers who have created such cynicism among traditional voters? Or will he be left so irreparably damaged that his image as a man in control will never be regained?</p> <p>Blair has no doubts. In private, he argues that in the real world voters are starting to see results: unemployment down, better schools, slow changes in the health service. In an interview for Michael Cockerell's programme on Alastair Campbell, to be screened on Saturday, Blair will criticise what he says is the press's obsession with splits. He says all he is doing is concentrating on the fundamentals.</p> <p>In part he has own spin machine to blame. 'Of course some can criticise how we have handled the message,' one Labour official said yesterday. 'I think we've learnt some lessons.'</p> <p>This is how the week spun out of control. Last Sunday, Roger Mosey, the head of BBC television, had just finished watching the Euro 2000 final when he first became involved in the 'Follett affair'. The match had gone to extra time and the television news summary was delayed.</p> <p>Mosey watched the efforts of his news team with interest. The Follett story led the bulletin. The report called it the bitterest row that had faced New Labour.</p> <p>Mosey wasn't happy. He called his news executives and pointed out that maybe 'bitterest row' was a bit strong, given the fallout over the euro, the Bernie Ecclestone affair and the Peter Mandelson home loan scandal. The report was toned down but it still led the 11pm bulletin. The rumour did the rounds that Campbell had been on to Mosey and ordered the BBC to act. It wasn't true. 'The Government gave this story legs,' a senior TV executive said. 'If they hadn't put Margaret Beckett up to attack Follett on Sunday maybe it would not have taken off like it did.'</p> <p>No chance. Andrew Grice, political editor of the Independent, knew that Frank Field, the sacked Welfare Minister, might have a few things to say about spin. He called him.</p> <p>Field did not disappoint, revealing that he had kept a detailed account of efforts to discredit him. Government aides had said Field was 'a complete joke' who was 'wrapped up in his own ego'. Field said he would go public if the Government didn't clean up its act. 'They had better behave themselves or they will have a nice publication on their hands.' Asked who was responsible for the negative briefing, he said: 'The manuscript is pretty clear on that.'</p> <p>There were more worries in Monday's papers. A leaked memo from Andrew Fraser, head of the Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain bureau warned that the strength of sterling meant the policy of gradual convergence with the euroland economies was 'no longer working' and the Government should expect 'high profile closures'.</p> <p>That morning in Downing Street, Blair was trying to keep his crime agenda going. Around the Cabinet Office table sat Home Secretary Jack Straw, Home Office Minister Charles Clarke, five chief constables and Professor Jonathan Shepherd, a crime expert. They had been invited to discuss cracking down on loutish behaviour.</p> <p>As they poured tea and water in readiness for the two-hour meeting, Blair spoke about his time living in Islington, an ordinary London borough, he said, which suffered its fair share of loutish behaviour. As a father and family man, he was determined to act.</p> <p>But his genuine effort to get 'joined-up' thinking going on crime was about to be hung out to dry because of a few lines spun from a speech the Thursday before. In Blair's speech to a religious audience in Germany a few paragraphs had been awkwardly inserted saying that police should be given powers to fine drunken yobs \u00a3100 on the spot. Blair even suggested that police should march transgressors to a cash machine and order them to take out the money. Advisers thought it showed that Blair was doing something.</p> <p>But at the Monday morning meeting the chief constables made it clear this would not work. 'The collection of cash is not a practical idea,' said Sir John Evans, the head of the Association of Chief Police Officers. Fingers have been pointed at Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff and the man charged, along with Campbell, with protecting the Prime Minister from stupidity. Critics say Powell should have picked up on the appoaching elephant trap.</p> <p>Clarke had to think quickly. He explained after the meeting that Blair's talk of \u00a3100 fines and cash points 'was a figure of speech'. He was forced to add a coda. 'I am not trying to get off the hook.'</p> <p>Blair's week was to get worse. Last Tuesday morning it was reported that four senior party figures - Doug Henderson, Rhodri Morgan, Tony Benn and Barbara Castle - backed Follet's plea for an end to the 'briefing culture'. The wheels were wobbling.</p> <p>Another leak brought the damaging European debate to the fore again. The British ambassador to Japan, Stephen Gomersall, was warning that Japanese investment might be put at risk if Britain did not make significant moves towards joining the euro.</p> <p>Blair knew he had to make an impact at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions. He met his key advisers, including Campbell and private secretary Bruce Grocott, and it was agreed that they would push the line, 'substance not spin', at everything William Hague could throw at them.</p> <p>It was a disaster. With the Commons packed and four former leaders of Australia looking on in bemused wonder from the public gallery, Blair was given a very public roasting. Tired after a series of nights kept awake by his two-month-old son, Leo, and grappling with the increasingly tense state in Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister said he had agreed to a memorial to US servicemen killed in the Second World War. Good idea, accept that it was Australian servicemen. He then said he was only interested in 'spin not substance'. Grocott's heart must have sunk.</p> <p>'Tony has a real problem with Question Time,' one senior Labour backbencher and former Minister said. 'He is too crammed with statistics and Hague beats him with quips and soundbites. He's got to relax, he's got to forget his barrister training.'</p> <p>Last Wednesday evening Blair was working alone on his speech to black evangelical leaders when the call came. He was already a little concerned about his son Euan, who was out with friends celebrating the end of his GCSEs. Cherie Blair was in Portugal for a few days with Leo and the Prime Minister was wondering how long he should wait before parental concern turned to action.</p> <p>As midnight approached, Special Branch officers rang and said that Blair's 16-year-old son had been found, drunk and incapable, in Leicester Square. He had given a false name, age and address. Police only realised who he was when they asked him to turn out his pockets and discovered Euan's Downing Street security pass.</p> <p>An hour later and Campbell was already getting calls. Someone had tipped off the tabloids. But it was very late, and the newspapers, aware of the dangers of reporting on the Blair's children, agreed to hold off.</p> <p>The next morning Campbell and Blair met to discuss how to handle the issue. Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, had put out a statement saying that because Euan was 16 and because it was not an incident linked to school he did not come under the press code of conduct which protected children. The London Evening Standard had already decided to run the story. Campbell knew they would have to put a brave face on it and give out the details of what was, at its simplest, a criminal offence. That morning's lobby briefing, in the hot and sweaty downstairs room next to No 10, was packed. Journalists were left queueing outside as the 11.30am start time came and went.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later Campbell arrived, clutching a mug of tea in one hand and a hastily typed-up statement in the other. He smiled as he fielded questions. Any drugs involved, Alastair? No. What do his parents think? Well, obviously, they're not very happy. All a bit embarrassing given the Prime Minister's pledge to clean hooligans and drunks off the streets? Well, put it this way, given that Euan was lying on the floor and couldn't move, there wasn't an awful lot of damage he could do. There was laughter.</p> <p>At 12.45pm the official cars pulled up outside Downing Street and Blair and Campbell were whisked to Victoria station for the 1.08pm train to Brighton where Blair was to address a conference organised by the African and Caribbean Evangelical Alliance.</p> <p>In the first-class carriage, the two men sat opposite each other and trawled through Blair's speech line by line. Some of the dryer passages were dropped and Blair decided it would be ridiculous if he didn't mention his son.</p> <p>In the ugly Seventies conference centre next door to the Brighton Pavilion, Blair went to the podium. 'The values you represent are the values we all share,' he said. 'Respect, tolerance, trying to bring up children properly.' He paused as a ripple of laughter went round the hall. 'That part was written a short time ago.'</p> <p>Then came the killer blow. 'Being a Prime Minister can be a tough job, but I always think that being a parent is probably tougher.' He was on the verge of tears. And then he revealed how tired he was. 'I know it's only been three years, sometimes it feels like 30.' The audience gave him a standing ovation.</p> <p>The day's finale, and the most testing engagement of all, was a recording of BBC's Question Time with David Dimbleby. It was filmed at Brighton and Hove Sixth Form College and from 4pm until his car swept up to the redbrick building around four hours later, Blair was doing his homework, closeted with advisers while a bus load of pro-hunting campaigners prepared for him, laughing and joking at a nearby pub.</p> <p>Blair was on form. He gave a robust response to those who heckled his positive stance on the euro. 'Even though it's unpopular with certain people sometimes it's up to the Prime Minister to tell people what they don't want to hear.'</p> <p>Blair has insisted to colleagues that after a week of froth, he wants to concentrate on the fundamentals - jobs, education, the economy.</p> <p>More than 20,000 documents entitled '300 Gains from a Labour Government', have been sent to MPs and party members. Achievement number one says 929,000 more jobs have been created since 1997 and that unemployment is at its lowest for 20 years. Number 300 details achievements in providing 'sport for all'. Members will be expected to stick to the '300 achievements' script as the election campaign approaches.</p> <p>This week sees the publication of the Government's annual report, which will show the party has achieved most of its election manifesto pledges. This is where Blair wants to focus the debate.</p> <p>There was a brief glimmer of sunshine from the right-wing press. Max Hastings, old-style Tory and editor of the Evening Standard, said: 'New Labour is going to be re-elected next year because the party looks like it belongs to the 21st century, while the Tories are mired in the twentieth.'</p> <p>But it was only a glimmer. By yesterday everyone was again asking the question: is Blair beginning to show the strain? 'The question is not, \"Has Tony Blair taken punishment?\" Like all his predecessors, he clearly has,' the Labour peer and former deputy leader of the party, Roy Hattersley, wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday. 'We need to know if he can survive. From time to time all politicians are knocked down. Will Blair get up?'</p> <p>Campbell dismisses all talk of Blair failing to take the strain. It's a difficult job, for God's sake, he says, and the Prime Minister is quite capable of handling it.</p> <p>As he got up to address the National Policy Forum in Exeter yesterday, Blair tried again to focus on on the Government's record, believing this is where he will beat Hague. The modern sports hall among the traditional spires of Exeter University seemed the perfect backdrop.</p>",

It was Saturday evening and the Labour Party official was on duty to field calls from journalists following up stories appearing in the next day's newspapers. On the other end of the phone was Bob Roberts, deputy political editor of the Press Association. Was Brind aware, Roberts asked, of a story appearing in the next day's Observer based on an article written by Ken Follett, the author who had helped to raise millions for New Labour? Brind wasn't. Roberts had received a press release from the Observer detailing Follett's allegation that Blair was guilty of making 'malicious gossip an everyday tool of modern British government'. Alastair Campbell, Blair's official spokesman, was also at home that night. Brind faxed him the release. Campbell read it and decided attack was the best form of defence. They put together a statement saying Follett was a man 'better known for his fiction than his judgment'. It was the start of a week that many have described as the worst seven days Blair has faced in government. Leaked memos revealed splits at the heart of government over the euro; police criticised plans over spot-fines for drunken yobs; Blair's performance at Prime Minister's Questions was described as lamentable; his son was found drunk in a gutter. So was this the beginning of the end of the Blair soap opera? Will the events of the past week finally force the real Blair to stand up, free of the spin doctors and advisers who have created such cynicism among traditional voters? Or will he be left so irreparably damaged that his image as a man in control will never be regained? Blair has no doubts. In private, he argues that in the real world voters are starting to see results: unemployment down, better schools, slow changes in the health service. In an interview for Michael Cockerell's programme on Alastair Campbell, to be screened on Saturday, Blair will criticise what he says is the press's obsession with splits. He says all he is doing is concentrating on the fundamentals. In part he has own spin machine to blame. 'Of course some can criticise how we have handled the message,' one Labour official said yesterday. 'I think we've learnt some lessons.' This is how the week spun out of control. Last Sunday, Roger Mosey, the head of BBC television, had just finished watching the Euro 2000 final when he first became involved in the 'Follett affair'. The match had gone to extra time and the television news summary was delayed. Mosey watched the efforts of his news team with interest. The Follett story led the bulletin. The report called it the bitterest row that had faced New Labour. Mosey wasn't happy. He called his news executives and pointed out that maybe 'bitterest row' was a bit strong, given the fallout over the euro, the Bernie Ecclestone affair and the Peter Mandelson home loan scandal. The report was toned down but it still led the 11pm bulletin. The rumour did the rounds that Campbell had been on to Mosey and ordered the BBC to act. It wasn't true. 'The Government gave this story legs,' a senior TV executive said. 'If they hadn't put Margaret Beckett up to attack Follett on Sunday maybe it would not have taken off like it did.' No chance. Andrew Grice, political editor of the Independent, knew that Frank Field, the sacked Welfare Minister, might have a few things to say about spin. He called him. Field did not disappoint, revealing that he had kept a detailed account of efforts to discredit him. Government aides had said Field was 'a complete joke' who was 'wrapped up in his own ego'. Field said he would go public if the Government didn't clean up its act. 'They had better behave themselves or they will have a nice publication on their hands.' Asked who was responsible for the negative briefing, he said: 'The manuscript is pretty clear on that.' There were more worries in Monday's papers. A leaked memo from Andrew Fraser, head of the Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain bureau warned that the strength of sterling meant the policy of gradual convergence with the euroland economies was 'no longer working' and the Government should expect 'high profile closures'. That morning in Downing Street, Blair was trying to keep his crime agenda going. Around the Cabinet Office table sat Home Secretary Jack Straw, Home Office Minister Charles Clarke, five chief constables and Professor Jonathan Shepherd, a crime expert. They had been invited to discuss cracking down on loutish behaviour. As they poured tea and water in readiness for the two-hour meeting, Blair spoke about his time living in Islington, an ordinary London borough, he said, which suffered its fair share of loutish behaviour. As a father and family man, he was determined to act. But his genuine effort to get 'joined-up' thinking going on crime was about to be hung out to dry because of a few lines spun from a speech the Thursday before. In Blair's speech to a religious audience in Germany a few paragraphs had been awkwardly inserted saying that police should be given powers to fine drunken yobs \u00a3100 on the spot. Blair even suggested that police should march transgressors to a cash machine and order them to take out the money. Advisers thought it showed that Blair was doing something. But at the Monday morning meeting the chief constables made it clear this would not work. 'The collection of cash is not a practical idea,' said Sir John Evans, the head of the Association of Chief Police Officers. Fingers have been pointed at Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff and the man charged, along with Campbell, with protecting the Prime Minister from stupidity. Critics say Powell should have picked up on the appoaching elephant trap. Clarke had to think quickly. He explained after the meeting that Blair's talk of \u00a3100 fines and cash points 'was a figure of speech'. He was forced to add a coda. 'I am not trying to get off the hook.' Blair's week was to get worse. Last Tuesday morning it was reported that four senior party figures - Doug Henderson, Rhodri Morgan, Tony Benn and Barbara Castle - backed Follet's plea for an end to the 'briefing culture'. The wheels were wobbling. Another leak brought the damaging European debate to the fore again. The British ambassador to Japan, Stephen Gomersall, was warning that Japanese investment might be put at risk if Britain did not make significant moves towards joining the euro. Blair knew he had to make an impact at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions. He met his key advisers, including Campbell and private secretary Bruce Grocott, and it was agreed that they would push the line, 'substance not spin', at everything William Hague could throw at them. It was a disaster. With the Commons packed and four former leaders of Australia looking on in bemused wonder from the public gallery, Blair was given a very public roasting. Tired after a series of nights kept awake by his two-month-old son, Leo, and grappling with the increasingly tense state in Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister said he had agreed to a memorial to US servicemen killed in the Second World War. Good idea, accept that it was Australian servicemen. He then said he was only interested in 'spin not substance'. Grocott's heart must have sunk. 'Tony has a real problem with Question Time,' one senior Labour backbencher and former Minister said. 'He is too crammed with statistics and Hague beats him with quips and soundbites. He's got to relax, he's got to forget his barrister training.' Last Wednesday evening Blair was working alone on his speech to black evangelical leaders when the call came. He was already a little concerned about his son Euan, who was out with friends celebrating the end of his GCSEs. Cherie Blair was in Portugal for a few days with Leo and the Prime Minister was wondering how long he should wait before parental concern turned to action. As midnight approached, Special Branch officers rang and said that Blair's 16-year-old son had been found, drunk and incapable, in Leicester Square. He had given a false name, age and address. Police only realised who he was when they asked him to turn out his pockets and discovered Euan's Downing Street security pass. An hour later and Campbell was already getting calls. Someone had tipped off the tabloids. But it was very late, and the newspapers, aware of the dangers of reporting on the Blair's children, agreed to hold off. The next morning Campbell and Blair met to discuss how to handle the issue. Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, had put out a statement saying that because Euan was 16 and because it was not an incident linked to school he did not come under the press code of conduct which protected children. The London Evening Standard had already decided to run the story. Campbell knew they would have to put a brave face on it and give out the details of what was, at its simplest, a criminal offence. That morning's lobby briefing, in the hot and sweaty downstairs room next to No 10, was packed. Journalists were left queueing outside as the 11.30am start time came and went. Twenty minutes later Campbell arrived, clutching a mug of tea in one hand and a hastily typed-up statement in the other. He smiled as he fielded questions. Any drugs involved, Alastair? No. What do his parents think? Well, obviously, they're not very happy. All a bit embarrassing given the Prime Minister's pledge to clean hooligans and drunks off the streets? Well, put it this way, given that Euan was lying on the floor and couldn't move, there wasn't an awful lot of damage he could do. There was laughter. At 12.45pm the official cars pulled up outside Downing Street and Blair and Campbell were whisked to Victoria station for the 1.08pm train to Brighton where Blair was to address a conference organised by the African and Caribbean Evangelical Alliance. In the first-class carriage, the two men sat opposite each other and trawled through Blair's speech line by line. Some of the dryer passages were dropped and Blair decided it would be ridiculous if he didn't mention his son. In the ugly Seventies conference centre next door to the Brighton Pavilion, Blair went to the podium. 'The values you represent are the values we all share,' he said. 'Respect, tolerance, trying to bring up children properly.' He paused as a ripple of laughter went round the hall. 'That part was written a short time ago.' Then came the killer blow. 'Being a Prime Minister can be a tough job, but I always think that being a parent is probably tougher.' He was on the verge of tears. And then he revealed how tired he was. 'I know it's only been three years, sometimes it feels like 30.' The audience gave him a standing ovation. The day's finale, and the most testing engagement of all, was a recording of BBC's Question Time with David Dimbleby. It was filmed at Brighton and Hove Sixth Form College and from 4pm until his car swept up to the redbrick building around four hours later, Blair was doing his homework, closeted with advisers while a bus load of pro-hunting campaigners prepared for him, laughing and joking at a nearby pub. Blair was on form. He gave a robust response to those who heckled his positive stance on the euro. 'Even though it's unpopular with certain people sometimes it's up to the Prime Minister to tell people what they don't want to hear.' Blair has insisted to colleagues that after a week of froth, he wants to concentrate on the fundamentals - jobs, education, the economy. More than 20,000 documents entitled '300 Gains from a Labour Government', have been sent to MPs and party members. Achievement number one says 929,000 more jobs have been created since 1997 and that unemployment is at its lowest for 20 years. Number 300 details achievements in providing 'sport for all'. Members will be expected to stick to the '300 achievements' script as the election campaign approaches. This week sees the publication of the Government's annual report, which will show the party has achieved most of its election manifesto pledges. This is where Blair wants to focus the debate. There was a brief glimmer of sunshine from the right-wing press. Max Hastings, old-style Tory and editor of the Evening Standard, said: 'New Labour is going to be re-elected next year because the party looks like it belongs to the 21st century, while the Tories are mired in the twentieth.' But it was only a glimmer. By yesterday everyone was again asking the question: is Blair beginning to show the strain? 'The question is not, \"Has Tony Blair taken punishment?\" Like all his predecessors, he clearly has,' the Labour peer and former deputy leader of the party, Roy Hattersley, wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday. 'We need to know if he can survive. From time to time all politicians are knocked down. Will Blair get up?' Campbell dismisses all talk of Blair failing to take the strain. It's a difficult job, for God's sake, he says, and the Prime Minister is quite capable of handling it. As he got up to address the National Policy Forum in Exeter yesterday, Blair tried again to focus on on the Government's record, believing this is where he will beat Hague. The modern sports hall among the traditional spires of Exeter University seemed the perfect backdrop.",

      "body": "<p>A special team of elite detectives has been set up to probe allegations that Customs and Excise officers set up a series of bogus drug deals to entrap men they suspected of trafficking heroin.</p> <p>A number of officers have been suspended and dozens questioned in the probe, which lawyers say could result in at least 13 convictions being overturned. Several convicted drugs dealers have been interviewed by the police in prison. Customs sources admit that the investigation is unprecedented.</p> <p>'It is by far the biggest ever. Nothing like this has ever happened before,' a senior officer said last week.</p> <p>The investigation is based in south Birmingham and is staffed by officers from West Midlands police force and the National Crime Squad - a nationwide pool of top detectives who investigate serious crimes. Unusually, the inquiry is being run by an assistant chief constable.</p> <p>The investigation centres on a series of Customs operations between 1994 and 1998 which led to the convictions of more than a dozen alleged drug traffickers. The inquiry was originally run by Customs officers themselves but was handed over to the police last year when its complexity and seriousness became obvious. The allegations against Customs officers include perversion of the course of justice - a police matter.</p> <p>The operations under investigation all involve 'controlled deliveries' of heroin to Britain from Pakistan. Informants were recruited by Customs to pose as couriers to arrange the smuggling of large quantities of heroin - refined in the lawless Pakistani border areas from locally grown opium - into the UK. They were monitored all the way by officers based at the British High Commission in Islamabad, the Pakistan capital, and in Britain.</p> <p>There have also been allegations that Customs officers 'recycled' seized drugs as bait for potential traffickers in fresh deals.</p> <p>The inquiry was launched after two court cases involving 55 kilos of heroin with a street value of around \u00a37 million collapsed when the alleged 'dealer' - a 45-year-old Bradford businessman - said he was prepared to give evidence on behalf of the five defendants. Solicitors in Birmingham, Bradford and Glasgow are all watching the inquiry with interest. The result of the police probe could launch a wave of appeals against recent convictions, lawyers say.</p> <p>Marsha Singh, Labour MP for Bradford West, has a number of his constituents among those convicted in trials now under examination by the West Midlands team.</p> <p>'A number of very serious charges have been made about controlled deliveries and it is important that the matter is cleared up as soon as possible,' he said.</p> <p>Corruption inquiries are rare among Customs and Excise officers. While the police have suffered a series of very public scandals resulting in scores of detectives being sacked, moved or disciplined, there are few recorded instances of Customs officers being found guilty of similar misdemeanours. Critics of the service say this is because Customs officers have managed to ward off public scrutiny more successfully than the police; their defenders say they are genuinely less prone to corruption.</p> <p>The number of police and Customs seizures involving heroin, still the most frequently seized Class A drug, rose to nearly 15,000 in 1998 - the most recent figures available - but the amount confiscated dropped.</p> <p>Last week Customs and Excise chiefs heard that they were to be quizzed by MPs to explain why the House of Commons had not been made aware of a legal loophole that may have cost the Exchequer up to \u00a32 billion.</p> <p>A Customs and Excise spokesman refused to go into details about the West Midlands inquiry.</p> <p>'This is a matter being quite properly dealt with by the police. We cannot comment on any ongoing investigation,' he said.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jason.burke@observer.co.uk\">jason.burke@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A special team of elite detectives has been set up to probe allegations that Customs and Excise officers set up a series of bogus drug deals to entrap men they suspected of trafficking heroin. A number of officers have been suspended and dozens questioned in the probe, which lawyers say could result in at least 13 convictions being overturned. Several convicted drugs dealers have been interviewed by the police in prison. Customs sources admit that the investigation is unprecedented. 'It is by far the biggest ever. Nothing like this has ever happened before,' a senior officer said last week. The investigation is based in south Birmingham and is staffed by officers from West Midlands police force and the National Crime Squad - a nationwide pool of top detectives who investigate serious crimes. Unusually, the inquiry is being run by an assistant chief constable. The investigation centres on a series of Customs operations between 1994 and 1998 which led to the convictions of more than a dozen alleged drug traffickers. The inquiry was originally run by Customs officers themselves but was handed over to the police last year when its complexity and seriousness became obvious. The allegations against Customs officers include perversion of the course of justice - a police matter. The operations under investigation all involve 'controlled deliveries' of heroin to Britain from Pakistan. Informants were recruited by Customs to pose as couriers to arrange the smuggling of large quantities of heroin - refined in the lawless Pakistani border areas from locally grown opium - into the UK. They were monitored all the way by officers based at the British High Commission in Islamabad, the Pakistan capital, and in Britain. There have also been allegations that Customs officers 'recycled' seized drugs as bait for potential traffickers in fresh deals. The inquiry was launched after two court cases involving 55 kilos of heroin with a street value of around \u00a37 million collapsed when the alleged 'dealer' - a 45-year-old Bradford businessman - said he was prepared to give evidence on behalf of the five defendants. Solicitors in Birmingham, Bradford and Glasgow are all watching the inquiry with interest. The result of the police probe could launch a wave of appeals against recent convictions, lawyers say. Marsha Singh, Labour MP for Bradford West, has a number of his constituents among those convicted in trials now under examination by the West Midlands team. 'A number of very serious charges have been made about controlled deliveries and it is important that the matter is cleared up as soon as possible,' he said. Corruption inquiries are rare among Customs and Excise officers. While the police have suffered a series of very public scandals resulting in scores of detectives being sacked, moved or disciplined, there are few recorded instances of Customs officers being found guilty of similar misdemeanours. Critics of the service say this is because Customs officers have managed to ward off public scrutiny more successfully than the police; their defenders say they are genuinely less prone to corruption. The number of police and Customs seizures involving heroin, still the most frequently seized Class A drug, rose to nearly 15,000 in 1998 - the most recent figures available - but the amount confiscated dropped. Last week Customs and Excise chiefs heard that they were to be quizzed by MPs to explain why the House of Commons had not been made aware of a legal loophole that may have cost the Exchequer up to \u00a32 billion. A Customs and Excise spokesman refused to go into details about the West Midlands inquiry. 'This is a matter being quite properly dealt with by the police. We cannot comment on any ongoing investigation,' he said. jason.burke@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Fidelity's new European Index fund sounds like a great idea. Europe has been one of the best-performing areas, and most expect this to continue. The fund is also a tracker, and statistics show that even the best active fund managers are lucky to outperform indexed funds by enough to compensate for their higher fees. </p> <p>But Europe is different. Statistics from HSBC show that, over the past five years, more than 80 per cent of actively managed European unit trusts beat the index, compared with just 27 per cent of UK specialists. HSBC's Alan Gadd suggests this is because European markets are influenced more by medium and small businesses. Active managers can reflect that in their portfolio; trackers cannot. Similarly, active managers can choose their countries; trackers have to invest across the whole of Europe. </p> <p>The difference in active and tracking portfolios is striking. Baillie Gifford European has just 42 stocks in its portfolio, while M &amp; G European has 57. In contrast M&amp;G's European tracker, launched in February, will have 500 when it is fully invested. Fidelity's fund will have just 50 - like the Dow Jones Eurostoxx index it tracks - but the choice will be based on market value. </p> <p>Baillie Gifford European's manager, Andrew Strathdee, has pursued a growth strategy, buying good small companies - an early success was Nokia, which now accounts for 9 per cent of the fund - and avoiding industries he expects to be dull. This has paid off. In the five years to 28 April, the fund is up 220 per cent, compared with 130 per cent for its FTSE index benchmark. </p> <p>So should investors shun European trackers? Not necessarily. You need to know what you're buying. Michael Hayden of Legal &amp; General points out that some funds sold as European are quite specialised - as Baillie Gifford's concentrated portfolio suggests. That can be disastrous - remember Peter Young and Morgan Grenfell's European funds. </p> <p>However, John Hatherly M&amp;G says Europe lags behind the UK and the US in restructuring and focus on shareholder value, so it is easier to pick companies which are likely to do well. </p> <p>Fidelity also offers a range of managed funds and sees its trackers as a good way for novice investors to build a balanced portfolio. More adventurous investors should look for managed funds - but be sure that they know what they are buying.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fidelity's new European Index fund sounds like a great idea. Europe has been one of the best-performing areas, and most expect this to continue. The fund is also a tracker, and statistics show that even the best active fund managers are lucky to outperform indexed funds by enough to compensate for their higher fees. But Europe is different. Statistics from HSBC show that, over the past five years, more than 80 per cent of actively managed European unit trusts beat the index, compared with just 27 per cent of UK specialists. HSBC's Alan Gadd suggests this is because European markets are influenced more by medium and small businesses. Active managers can reflect that in their portfolio; trackers cannot. Similarly, active managers can choose their countries; trackers have to invest across the whole of Europe. The difference in active and tracking portfolios is striking. Baillie Gifford European has just 42 stocks in its portfolio, while M &amp; G European has 57. In contrast M&amp;G's European tracker, launched in February, will have 500 when it is fully invested. Fidelity's fund will have just 50 - like the Dow Jones Eurostoxx index it tracks - but the choice will be based on market value. Baillie Gifford European's manager, Andrew Strathdee, has pursued a growth strategy, buying good small companies - an early success was Nokia, which now accounts for 9 per cent of the fund - and avoiding industries he expects to be dull. This has paid off. In the five years to 28 April, the fund is up 220 per cent, compared with 130 per cent for its FTSE index benchmark. So should investors shun European trackers? Not necessarily. You need to know what you're buying. Michael Hayden of Legal &amp; General points out that some funds sold as European are quite specialised - as Baillie Gifford's concentrated portfolio suggests. That can be disastrous - remember Peter Young and Morgan Grenfell's European funds. However, John Hatherly M&amp;G says Europe lags behind the UK and the US in restructuring and focus on shareholder value, so it is easier to pick companies which are likely to do well. Fidelity also offers a range of managed funds and sees its trackers as a good way for novice investors to build a balanced portfolio. More adventurous investors should look for managed funds - but be sure that they know what they are buying.",

      "body": "<p>Why is the City so obsessed with the value of Dixons' stake in Freeserve? The retailer has invested less than \u00a32 million in the business and has already recouped almost \u00a3250m through the sale of a 20 per cent stake. If it realises the same price for the remaining 80 per cent - and, unlike practically every other internet flotation, Freeserve's shares are still more than 50 per cent above their issue price - Dixons could pocket another \u00a31 billion. If only it could make that kind of return from selling toasters and computers. </p> <p>The problem is, of course, that it is unlikely to be able to sell the remainder - at least for the foreseeable future. It may have been able to persuade punters to part with hard cash last July, but floating another large tranche would be unlikely to be so easy. The rather-too-public attempt to auction off Freeserve merely confirmed that no serious bidder would be prepared to offer cash. For Dixons' shareholders, a smaller stake in a larger internet stock would be little better than the large stake in a small ISP. </p> <p>In the meantime, the market is at a loss as to how to value Freeserve. Is it worth the current value of \u00a33.3bn, or is \u00a39.4bn (the peak reached in March) or \u00a31.2bn (which it sunk to in October) more appropriate? </p> <p>Analysts are fond of doing sums to prove that Dixons' core business is undervalued, based on stripping out the value of Freeserve. In fact, the only thing such calculations prove is that retail investors have been far more realistic about the ISP's worth than technology punters are. </p> <p>When Freeserve shares were at their peak, Dixons looked extremely undervalued - indeed, the analysts proclaimed you were getting the retail chain for free. But that was simply because retail investors, sensibly enough as it turned out, did not believe the toppy valuation. </p> <p>The Freeserve conundrum is, however, diverting attention from the performance of Dixons' core business. At the moment, that may be no bad thing. On the face of it, the results are not bad, particularly given the poor retailing climate. Profits, excluding the Freeserve disposal and Dixons' share of the ongoing losses of the business, rose by 11 per cent. </p> <p>The trouble is, sales from continuing businesses were 16 per cent ahead. The difference between the two rates of increase was a squeeze on margins, which fell by 1 per cent. </p> <p>Dixons makes much of the fact that it managed to claw back three-quarters of that lost margin through improved efficiency in the buying process, streamlining its customer service centre and tinkering with its store design. The trouble is, the City expects at least as much margin pressure this year - and if Dixons carries on recouping only some of that through cost control, the result will be lower returns. </p> <p>Group finance director Ian Livingston is confident that the company can offset 'most, if not all' the margin pressure by continued attention to costs. Investors are sceptical - and that scepticism was increased by the group's reluctance to be specific about current trading. The rather woolly 'the year has started with further sales growth against tough comparatives' was taken as meaning that the rate of increase in the UK stores has slowed markedly from last year's 7 per cent like for like. </p> <p>There were pockets of disappointment. The 3 per cent like-for-like increase in sales at Currys is less than half that enjoyed by rival Comet, although Livingston believes improvements in store design and stock levels will help. Overall, however, Dixons seems like a business that will struggle for headway. </p> <p>That is confirmed by analysts' forecasts that profits in the year to next April, excluding Freeserve, will be about \u00a3267m - similar to last year. Stripping out Freeserve, that leaves the retail business on a price-earnings ratio of about 13 times. Whether that is realistic depends far less on the future of Dixons' business than on your assumptions about the value of Freeserve. Until that is resolved - and Dixons shows it can cope with margin pressure - there is no reason to buy the shares. </p> <p><strong> Mixed brew</strong></p> <p> Brian Stewart, chief executive of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, talks about a 'strategic reshaping' of the group, following the acquisition of Kronenbourg beer, Greenalls pubs and restaurants and the, hopefully, imminent sale of Center Parcs and Pontin's. So far, however, little of that strategic reshaping has been evident in the shares, which still stand on a rating of about 10 times earnings. </p> <p>There was enough in the results for the year to March to suggest that that could be a bit unfair. The shares dipped initially on disappointment that the \u00a3415m profit was a bit below the City's expectations, but they subsequently bounced as investors got to grips with the prospects for the new-look group. </p> <p>Little of that new look was evident in the figures. Greenalls was included for just five months, and the Kronenbourg deal has still to be completed. But the potential is already clear. The \u00a325m cost savings promised at Greenalls is on target. The 6 per cent drop in food sales at its outlets, compared with an impressive 14 per cent growth in S&amp;N's own brands, underlines the potential for improving its performance. </p> <p>There is still much to do. The 'tail' of unbranded pubs is still holding back performance, accounting for much of the squeeze in margins suffered by the managed-pub divisions. Only 40 per cent of the estate is currently branded, under names such as Chef &amp; Brewer. S&amp;N's target is 65 per cent. </p> <p>Analysts say that will mean selling a further 500 pubs, although the company suggests the figure could be closer to 300. In brewing, Interbrew's acquisition of the beer business of Whitbread and Bass may have knocked S&amp;N off the top slot, but it could still be good for prospects. Interbrew will be left with significant debt, not to mention the need to demonstrate that it can handle two such sizable deals. </p> <p>It is more likely to want to keep the market stable - and margins healthy - than to do anything to upset it. That should help keep profits at S&amp;N's brewing division, up 4.8 per cent last year, on an upward trend. </p> <p>The delayed sale of Center Parcs is likely to continue to weigh on the shares. Analysts are now expecting it to raise as little as \u00a3700m, compared with talk a few months ago of \u00a3800m - and investment of more than \u00a31.2bn since it was acquired. The shares are unlikely to move much until that deal is completed, but they do currently look cheap.</p>",

Since the disastrous New Year's Eve opening of the Dome, there has been a healthy realisation that the Blair regime is mortal. </p> <p>The curse of the Government's failure to provide even a drink for some of the Dome's backers on New Year's Eve lives on: some prominent City figures invited to dine with the Chancellor and the American Ambassador to celebrate British entrepreneurship at the Dome last Wednesday could not quite face it. </p> <p>If the myth of New Labour's magical powers has been laid to rest, one other myth, associated with the nation's obsession with 'spin', has endured. </p> <p>This is that Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell and the rest walked into Whitehall and 'took over' the civil service. That wise observer of Whitehall, Professor Colin Campbell of Georgetown University, Washington DC, has recently been over on one of his regular check-ups of British governance, and reached a conclusion that explains quite a lot. According to Campbell (Colin, not Alastair), far from taking over Whitehall, 'Blair and his Party have been captured by Whitehall'. </p> <p>This helps explain many things. Much of the offence caused to Labour voters over civil liberties appears to have been the result of incoming Labour Ministers picking up Whitehall ideas for intervening in people's lives that even the Tories turned down. </p> <p>Indeed, it is not uncommon to meet former Conservative Cabinet ministers who freely admit that they recognise a lot of the controversial policies that have swept through the Commons and are now being seriously challenged in the Lords - because Whitehall raised them as options during 1990-97, but they were turned down. Some of those former Ministers can now challenge such policies in the Lords. </p> <p>The Foreign Secretary's increasingly open championship of the euro constitutes a magnificent example of 'capture' by Whitehall.

      "bodyText": "The Government may be spinning out of control, but this merely means that normal service has been resumed. Since the disastrous New Year's Eve opening of the Dome, there has been a healthy realisation that the Blair regime is mortal. The curse of the Government's failure to provide even a drink for some of the Dome's backers on New Year's Eve lives on: some prominent City figures invited to dine with the Chancellor and the American Ambassador to celebrate British entrepreneurship at the Dome last Wednesday could not quite face it. If the myth of New Labour's magical powers has been laid to rest, one other myth, associated with the nation's obsession with 'spin', has endured. This is that Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell and the rest walked into Whitehall and 'took over' the civil service. That wise observer of Whitehall, Professor Colin Campbell of Georgetown University, Washington DC, has recently been over on one of his regular check-ups of British governance, and reached a conclusion that explains quite a lot.

The tycoon, who has a chain of record shops and cinemas in Japan, has offered to assist the family of Lucy Blackman with a poster campaign in Tokyo and the neighbouring area of China. The 21-year-old has not been seen since she failed to meet a friend on 1 July. Japanese police have issued a nationwide alert and asked for a check of hospitals. An appeal for information on Lucy's whereabouts will be printed in the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper. 'We feel that Lucy's life may be at risk,' said her sister Sophie, who has flown from Britain to help coordinate the search. 'All we know is that she left the house and failed to return. It is not like her.' The Blackman family, from Sevenoaks, Kent, contacted Richard Branson through a friend who works for Virgin. The millionaire businessman has asked his Japanese staff to display posters of Lucy, requesting that she return home because a relative is unwell. Lucy, a former British Airways cabinet crew attendant, arrived in Japan reportedly for a holiday with her friend, Louise Phillips, on 4 May. Neither speaks Japanese. According to Phillips, the two girls arranged to meet at Shibuya, a well-known Tokyo nightspot, last Saturday. 'She rang up and said I'll be there in an hour so get ready to go out,' said Phillips. 'I haven't heard from her since.' The British consulate have been helping to liaise with Japanese authorities, but there has been no progress. Police have hacked into Lucy's email in a bid to identify a man that she is believed to have met for lunch on the day she disappeared. They have also conducted inquiries in the area where Lucy was staying and been to nightspots she was known to frequent, but her whereabouts remain unknown. 'At the moment all we have is conjecture,' said Tim Blackman, Lucy's father. 'All that we know for sure is that she failed to turn up having said that she would.'",

New research reveals that many of the nation's schoolchildren are wimps who hate playing games because it means getting wet, dirty and sweaty, falling over and ruining your hair.</p> <p>Up to two-thirds of pupils resent sport's time-honoured rituals such as having to get changed, putting up with bad weather, taking a shower afterwards or learning a new skill. One in six is 'too embarrassed' to get involved, even more dislike playing sport if it's competitive, and one in four plans to give it up on leaving school.</p> <p>The biggest ever survey of young people's attitudes to sport shows that, in spite of stars such as David Beckham's huge popularity, many of them see it as something to be endured rather than enjoyed. Computer games, television and teenagers' increasing obsession with looking good are all to blame. For many, sport is no longer cool.</p> <p>The study, in which pollsters Mori questioned 3,300 pupils aged between five and 16 for Sport England, will make grim reading for coaches and managers worried about the glaring lack of homegrown talent.

      "bodyText": "Despite humiliation at Euro 2000, countless defeats at cricket and Henman and Rusedski's early exits from Wimbledon, England's sporting decline is not yet complete. New research reveals that many of the nation's schoolchildren are wimps who hate playing games because it means getting wet, dirty and sweaty, falling over and ruining your hair. Up to two-thirds of pupils resent sport's time-honoured rituals such as having to get changed, putting up with bad weather, taking a shower afterwards or learning a new skill. One in six is 'too embarrassed' to get involved, even more dislike playing sport if it's competitive, and one in four plans to give it up on leaving school. The biggest ever survey of young people's attitudes to sport shows that, in spite of stars such as David Beckham's huge popularity, many of them see it as something to be endured rather than enjoyed. Computer games, television and teenagers' increasing obsession with looking good are all to blame. For many, sport is no longer cool. The study, in which pollsters Mori questioned 3,300 pupils aged between five and 16 for Sport England, will make grim reading for coaches and managers worried about the glaring lack of homegrown talent. Trevor Brooking, the ex-England footballer who is Sport England's chairman, said he was 'worried, but not surprised' by the findings and feared what the implications would be for the quest for a new generation of world-class performers. 'There's an apathy towards sport among many young people these days. There has been an extremely significant decline in the traditional \"British fighting spirit\" in sport, which is famous around the world. It is a major drawback. 'That spirit has been diluted by too many people saying \"don't worry, at least you tried\", and too many years of non-competitive sport in schools, where everyone was congratulated simply for turning up and taking part and exceptional performance was not rewarded with prizes because some teachers felt that was unhealthy and would put some kids off from playing. That created an environment of average output in sport.' When asked what they disliked about doing sport, 64 per cent of the girls and 41 per cent of the boys mentioned 'being hit, kicked or falling over during sport'. Almost as many, 56 per cent of girls and 33 per cent of boys, cited 'going outside for bad weather'. Many do not want to either get 'cold and wet' (48/29 per cent) or 'hot, sweaty or dirty' (51/25 per cent), while over a fifth of both sexes list 'having to wash or shower after sports' as a deterrent. A quarter of girls confessed that 'getting wet hair' puts them off doing sport, but only 9 per cent of boys agreed. 'Having to change in and out of sports clothes' is disliked by 36 per cent of females and 26 per cent of boys; a third of all teenagers dislike having to exchange their school uniforms for shorts, vests, gym knickers and tennis skirts. John Matthews, chief executive of the Physical Education Association of the UK, which represents 4,000 PE teachers, said: 'This research confirms what we have suspected for some time, that society's perception is that sport isn't as much fun as it used to be and that children are less up for sport than before. 'Young people are less hardy these days than they used to be. They will look out of the window before a PE lesson, see that it's drizzling and ask if they can do it inside in the sports hall rather than outside on the grass.' Matthews, a PE teacher himself, believes the increased importance to youngsters of their 'body image' was responsible for much of the change in attitudes. Girls, especially, are more reluctant than before to put their bodies on show by getting changed or washed. 'Schools are now very aware of that issue and very few insist any more that every pupil has a shower after a games or PE lesson.' Perhaps the most alarming conclusion in the research is that two in five children are put off doing sport at school 'if it takes you a long time to learn something new'. Brooking said: 'These days when the going gets tough in the key moments of a competitive tennis match or football game, too many youngsters shrug their shoulders and don't have the determination and will to compete and really hang in there that you need to succeed in sport. Too many want to have success without first putting in hard work.' Sport England's survey also shows that large numbers of young people start to dislike sport, and give up doing it if they can, as soon as they head towards their teenage years. This phenomenon of 'dropout' begins among girls at 10 or 11 but does not strike boys until they are 12 or 13. Interest in pop music, magazines, going out with their friends and, especially, the opposite sex become preferable to any physical activity. Brooking said that urgent Government action was needed to improve run-down sports facilities and overhaul the 'often poor' quality of PE teaching in schools. Ministers, he said, could enhance participation in sport at a stroke by insisting that all pupils had to do a minimum of two hours of PE a week in school time.

      "body": "<p>Aids will kill one-third of working age people in Botswana. Read that again. In Botswana, one third of people aged 15 to 49 are HIV positive, and they will die.</p> <p>Sometimes it's too much for those who deal with the disease every day. Nurse Olebogeng Tsedi has watched the Aids epidemic seep through her country like poison, felling patients and colleagues alike.</p> <p>'When you get home you're so tired,' she said, smart in her white uniform with old-fashioned navy cape, lined in scarlet silk. 'You think of friends who have passed away, you think of friends who are HIV positive... you think, it means my friend will be like that patient. So you sit and start crying.'</p> <p>The hospitals are full, so Tsedi organises volunteers to care for Aids patients in their own homes in Molepolole, a sprawling village 50 miles from the capital, Gaborone. Her aim is to prolong the lives of those already infected, and educate those who are not how to avoid the virus. It's not easy in a country where many believe Aids is a curse that can be lifted only by witchcraft.</p> <p>Dirang Rapula lies in a rumpled bed, complaining that her legs will no longer carry her. The one-room house contains the possessions she bought with wages earned in the South African mining town of Rustenburg where she worked as a maid. She has a mirror, several chairs and a wardrobe. That, she believes, was her downfall. Other women were jealous of her furniture and laid a curse. 'I've been bewitched because I was able to take care of my children,' she explains, her face gaunt as she lies back on the pillow. 'The traditional doctor said it was witchcraft. Straightaway he gave me medicine, and immediately I felt better.'</p> <p>She is far too sick to look after her children today, but that has not shaken her faith in traditional beliefs. Her eldest daughter, Kearoma, aged 23, sits on the end of the bed watching her mother. Her light brown jacket is torn and she is too weak to work so earns a few pennies braiding the neighbours' hair. She miscarried a baby a few months ago, and was then diagnosed HIV positive, but she too doubts the doctors.</p> <p>'I know Aids exists, but I go to a spiritual healing church, and there they say it's witchcraft,' she said.</p> <p>Nurse Tsedi tries to help them understand. But her scientific explanation, however simply put, has a flaw. Scientists and doctors admit they cannot cure Aids, but the witchdoctor says he can. No wonder Tsedi cries at home in the evenings.</p> <p>The cheapest funeral costs about \u00a3130, and these days families are devoting more and more of their income and time to dealing with death. Calvin Ngwape, the manager of Pule Funeral Parlour in Gaborone, said that two decades ago they processed three or four funerals per week, now it was 20 or more. 'In Botswana, the old are burying the young,' he said.</p> <p>On Saturday night in Gaborone, those most at risk are out in the shebeens and bars. Reseachers say this is a promiscuous society and the government's message has not yet got through.</p> <p>'It is very difficult for us young people to abstain,' said Inyaneng Dipatane, an actress. 'We have already tasted the delights of honey so it's very difficult to stop.' In the latest production from the Reetsanang Drama Group, Inyaneng plays a woman whose sister is forced into sex without a condom by her HIV-positive husband. She dies a horrific, painful death. The play is based on the cast's own experience.</p> <p>'I'm afraid of death and every time I look at my family, I sit alone and think: who is next?' reflects Inyaneng. Despite government exhortations that everyone should know their HIV status, even those giving out the health education messages are too frightened to get tested.</p> <p>'I'm married now, but I don't remember what I did 15 years back and I don't even know what my wife did before we got married,' said Reesanang's director, James Chitukuta, who has lost 15 friends to Aids. 'We haven't been tested and I don't know my status, but looking at my friends, I'm scared. Very, very scared.'</p> <p>President Festus Mogae is scared too. 'Aids permeates all our society and everything we do, and therefore it has to be and is our preoccupation,' he said. 'We must subordinate puritanical considerations to the superior value of national survival,' he said in a recent address. He mentions the disease in every speech and wears an Aids ribbon at all times.</p> <p>Botswana produces nearly one-third of the world's diamonds, and has Africa's fastest growing economy. Diamond mining provides little employment, so people remain poor and there is high unemployment, but over 30 years of independence the government has built up a welfare state and paid for hundreds of young people to be trained abroad.</p> <p>'Aids cuts across our efforts in fighting poverty,' said President Mogae. 'The other day we had to charter a plane from the United States to bring home two ill students whose ailment had progressed so far the airlines would not take them. We could have built a country primary school with the cost of that charter,' he said.</p> <p>The government is considering compulsory Aids tests for anyone applying for a government scholarship to study overseas. Human rights activists, who point out that Botswana is one of Africa's few democracies, say this would violate medical confidentiality. 'We may have to change the law,' responds the President.</p> <p>At this week's Aids conference in Durban, economist Robert Greener will present the first paper analysing the likely impact of Aids on Botswana's economy. The people will get poorer, he will say. Already, the able-bodied are giving up work to look after dying family members and orphans.</p> <p>Nurse Tsedi walks home through the murmuring evening streets of Molepolole. She listens to children chattering, goats bleating, the sound of people coming back from work and preparing the evening meal. 'You cry for someone out there who's suffering. You try to help.' She shrugs. 'But in the end, what can you do?</p> <p>Lindsey Hilsum is Diplomatic correspondent for Channel 4. She will report from Durban this evening at 7.30pm</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aids will kill one-third of working age people in Botswana. Read that again. In Botswana, one third of people aged 15 to 49 are HIV positive, and they will die. Sometimes it's too much for those who deal with the disease every day. Nurse Olebogeng Tsedi has watched the Aids epidemic seep through her country like poison, felling patients and colleagues alike. 'When you get home you're so tired,' she said, smart in her white uniform with old-fashioned navy cape, lined in scarlet silk. 'You think of friends who have passed away, you think of friends who are HIV positive... you think, it means my friend will be like that patient. So you sit and start crying.' The hospitals are full, so Tsedi organises volunteers to care for Aids patients in their own homes in Molepolole, a sprawling village 50 miles from the capital, Gaborone. Her aim is to prolong the lives of those already infected, and educate those who are not how to avoid the virus. It's not easy in a country where many believe Aids is a curse that can be lifted only by witchcraft. Dirang Rapula lies in a rumpled bed, complaining that her legs will no longer carry her. The one-room house contains the possessions she bought with wages earned in the South African mining town of Rustenburg where she worked as a maid. She has a mirror, several chairs and a wardrobe. That, she believes, was her downfall. Other women were jealous of her furniture and laid a curse. 'I've been bewitched because I was able to take care of my children,' she explains, her face gaunt as she lies back on the pillow. 'The traditional doctor said it was witchcraft. Straightaway he gave me medicine, and immediately I felt better.' She is far too sick to look after her children today, but that has not shaken her faith in traditional beliefs. Her eldest daughter, Kearoma, aged 23, sits on the end of the bed watching her mother. Her light brown jacket is torn and she is too weak to work so earns a few pennies braiding the neighbours' hair. She miscarried a baby a few months ago, and was then diagnosed HIV positive, but she too doubts the doctors. 'I know Aids exists, but I go to a spiritual healing church, and there they say it's witchcraft,' she said. Nurse Tsedi tries to help them understand. But her scientific explanation, however simply put, has a flaw. Scientists and doctors admit they cannot cure Aids, but the witchdoctor says he can. No wonder Tsedi cries at home in the evenings. The cheapest funeral costs about \u00a3130, and these days families are devoting more and more of their income and time to dealing with death. Calvin Ngwape, the manager of Pule Funeral Parlour in Gaborone, said that two decades ago they processed three or four funerals per week, now it was 20 or more. 'In Botswana, the old are burying the young,' he said. On Saturday night in Gaborone, those most at risk are out in the shebeens and bars. Reseachers say this is a promiscuous society and the government's message has not yet got through. 'It is very difficult for us young people to abstain,' said Inyaneng Dipatane, an actress. 'We have already tasted the delights of honey so it's very difficult to stop.' In the latest production from the Reetsanang Drama Group, Inyaneng plays a woman whose sister is forced into sex without a condom by her HIV-positive husband. She dies a horrific, painful death. The play is based on the cast's own experience. 'I'm afraid of death and every time I look at my family, I sit alone and think: who is next?' reflects Inyaneng. Despite government exhortations that everyone should know their HIV status, even those giving out the health education messages are too frightened to get tested. 'I'm married now, but I don't remember what I did 15 years back and I don't even know what my wife did before we got married,' said Reesanang's director, James Chitukuta, who has lost 15 friends to Aids. 'We haven't been tested and I don't know my status, but looking at my friends, I'm scared. Very, very scared.' President Festus Mogae is scared too. 'Aids permeates all our society and everything we do, and therefore it has to be and is our preoccupation,' he said. 'We must subordinate puritanical considerations to the superior value of national survival,' he said in a recent address. He mentions the disease in every speech and wears an Aids ribbon at all times. Botswana produces nearly one-third of the world's diamonds, and has Africa's fastest growing economy. Diamond mining provides little employment, so people remain poor and there is high unemployment, but over 30 years of independence the government has built up a welfare state and paid for hundreds of young people to be trained abroad. 'Aids cuts across our efforts in fighting poverty,' said President Mogae. 'The other day we had to charter a plane from the United States to bring home two ill students whose ailment had progressed so far the airlines would not take them. We could have built a country primary school with the cost of that charter,' he said. The government is considering compulsory Aids tests for anyone applying for a government scholarship to study overseas. Human rights activists, who point out that Botswana is one of Africa's few democracies, say this would violate medical confidentiality. 'We may have to change the law,' responds the President. At this week's Aids conference in Durban, economist Robert Greener will present the first paper analysing the likely impact of Aids on Botswana's economy. The people will get poorer, he will say. Already, the able-bodied are giving up work to look after dying family members and orphans. Nurse Tsedi walks home through the murmuring evening streets of Molepolole. She listens to children chattering, goats bleating, the sound of people coming back from work and preparing the evening meal. 'You cry for someone out there who's suffering. You try to help.' She shrugs. 'But in the end, what can you do? Lindsey Hilsum is Diplomatic correspondent for Channel 4. She will report from Durban this evening at 7.30pm",

      "body": "<p>Charles Dempsey cut a fairly pathetic figure around Zurich's elegant Dolder Grand Hotel last Wednesday night. Shuffling along with a slight stoop and troubled by poor eyesight, the frail 78-year-old did not look like one of the most powerful men in world football.</p> <p>His shambling appearance disguised the fact that Dempsey is one of the 24 members of the executive committee of Fifa, the game's global governing body. It had gathered amid customary five-star luxury near its Swiss headquarters to decide on the next day which of the four bidding countries would be awarded the money-spinning honour of hosting the 2006 World Cup.</p> <p>Unknown to Fifa, the previously marginal Dempsey was about to emerge as the key figure in 24 hours of extraordinary drama, intrigue and farce which ended with outsiders Germany unexpectedly wrecking South Africa's dream of becoming the first African nation to stage the biggest sporting event in the world.</p> <p>By yesterday, Dempsey had become football's most wanted man. He was in hiding at his plush home in Auckland, New Zealand, and still refusing to answer why, by abstaining at a crucial stage of the voting, he handed Germany the tournament. He is due to explain himself today to the Oceania football congress, of which he is president, and answer questions tomorrow about one of the most mysterious and shameful chapters in recent football history.</p> <p>The man with the crucial vote is an ageing expatriate Scot who is New Zealand's member of the executive. Dempsey was born in Glasgow in 1922, served as a petty officer in the Second World War and moved to Auckland after the war, where he set up a construction business that would make him a millionaire. He owes his place at football's top table to his 40 years spent developing soccer down under. Even his friends in British football say he is 'prickly and suspicious and doesn't make friends easily'. One of them described Dempsey as 'a confused geriatric who is out of his depth in Fifa politics and cracked under the pressure.'</p> <p>Dempsey was already in turmoil last Wednesday night about how he should use his vote the next morning. His personal preference was to back England, although they had no chance, and then switch to Germany once the bid championed by his friends from the Football Association had been rejected. Despite England spending more and travelling further than any of their rivals in their high-profile quest for votes, they actually persuaded almost nobody.</p> <p>But the Oceania football congress had ordered him to support South Africa after England's widely anticipated early elimination. Should Dempsey follow his instincts or bow to the wishes of his colleagues? After hours of agonising, he resolved his dilemma in an idiosyncratic and histrionic way. He backed England in the first two rounds of the ballot, but then, with Germany and South Africa tied at 11-11, refused to vote again - a fateful decision which ensured Europe was handed its tenth World Cup while Africa was left still waiting for its first. Dempsey's bizarre behaviour means he is now an object of unique loathing for many people in football who believe 'fair play' - Fifa's motto - has been sacrificed on the altar of one man's selfishness and antipathy towards the developing world.</p> <p>'He has betrayed the South African people,' fumed Irvin Khoza, chairman of the country's bid, which most observers of the four-year 2006 race had expected would succeed.</p> <p>Trevor Mallard, New Zealand's Sports Minister, was just as blunt. 'Dempsey is an international embarrassment.' Dempsey's plea that he was under 'unsustainable pressure', including death threats, did nothing to stop the deluge of criticism. Helen Clark, New Zealand's Prime Minister, said she was upset by the result and telephoned South African President Thabo Mbeki to apologise for Dempsey's action.</p> <p>'This old fool has denied Africa its destiny, its turn and its place in history', said an angry member of the South African team. 'He voted for England, even though they never had a chance, and then he refused to do what was democratically decided he should do, which was to back South Africa once England were out. I don't know why he abstained.</p> <p>'Was he bribed? Is his attachment to the mother country, and Europe in general, so great that he couldn't see the merits of letting someone else have a go at staging the World Cup? Does he really think South Africa couldn't do that? Does he think so little of us?'</p> <p>A clue to Dempsey's mindset is that he was one of only two of the 24 Fifa voters who did not take up any of the numerous invitations they received to visit South Africa and assess first-hand the rainbow nation's readiness to host the 2006 tournament. He always claimed he was too busy, yet managed to find the time for regular trips back to Britain and Europe, often to watch big football matches such as the FA Cup Final and the final of the European Champions League.

      "bodyText": "Charles Dempsey cut a fairly pathetic figure around Zurich's elegant Dolder Grand Hotel last Wednesday night. Shuffling along with a slight stoop and troubled by poor eyesight, the frail 78-year-old did not look like one of the most powerful men in world football. His shambling appearance disguised the fact that Dempsey is one of the 24 members of the executive committee of Fifa, the game's global governing body. It had gathered amid customary five-star luxury near its Swiss headquarters to decide on the next day which of the four bidding countries would be awarded the money-spinning honour of hosting the 2006 World Cup. Unknown to Fifa, the previously marginal Dempsey was about to emerge as the key figure in 24 hours of extraordinary drama, intrigue and farce which ended with outsiders Germany unexpectedly wrecking South Africa's dream of becoming the first African nation to stage the biggest sporting event in the world. By yesterday, Dempsey had become football's most wanted man. He was in hiding at his plush home in Auckland, New Zealand, and still refusing to answer why, by abstaining at a crucial stage of the voting, he handed Germany the tournament. He is due to explain himself today to the Oceania football congress, of which he is president, and answer questions tomorrow about one of the most mysterious and shameful chapters in recent football history. The man with the crucial vote is an ageing expatriate Scot who is New Zealand's member of the executive. Dempsey was born in Glasgow in 1922, served as a petty officer in the Second World War and moved to Auckland after the war, where he set up a construction business that would make him a millionaire. He owes his place at football's top table to his 40 years spent developing soccer down under. Even his friends in British football say he is 'prickly and suspicious and doesn't make friends easily'. One of them described Dempsey as 'a confused geriatric who is out of his depth in Fifa politics and cracked under the pressure.' Dempsey was already in turmoil last Wednesday night about how he should use his vote the next morning. His personal preference was to back England, although they had no chance, and then switch to Germany once the bid championed by his friends from the Football Association had been rejected. Despite England spending more and travelling further than any of their rivals in their high-profile quest for votes, they actually persuaded almost nobody. But the Oceania football congress had ordered him to support South Africa after England's widely anticipated early elimination. Should Dempsey follow his instincts or bow to the wishes of his colleagues? After hours of agonising, he resolved his dilemma in an idiosyncratic and histrionic way. He backed England in the first two rounds of the ballot, but then, with Germany and South Africa tied at 11-11, refused to vote again - a fateful decision which ensured Europe was handed its tenth World Cup while Africa was left still waiting for its first. Dempsey's bizarre behaviour means he is now an object of unique loathing for many people in football who believe 'fair play' - Fifa's motto - has been sacrificed on the altar of one man's selfishness and antipathy towards the developing world. 'He has betrayed the South African people,' fumed Irvin Khoza, chairman of the country's bid, which most observers of the four-year 2006 race had expected would succeed. Trevor Mallard, New Zealand's Sports Minister, was just as blunt. 'Dempsey is an international embarrassment.' Dempsey's plea that he was under 'unsustainable pressure', including death threats, did nothing to stop the deluge of criticism. Helen Clark, New Zealand's Prime Minister, said she was upset by the result and telephoned South African President Thabo Mbeki to apologise for Dempsey's action. 'This old fool has denied Africa its destiny, its turn and its place in history', said an angry member of the South African team. 'He voted for England, even though they never had a chance, and then he refused to do what was democratically decided he should do, which was to back South Africa once England were out. I don't know why he abstained. 'Was he bribed? Is his attachment to the mother country, and Europe in general, so great that he couldn't see the merits of letting someone else have a go at staging the World Cup? Does he really think South Africa couldn't do that? Does he think so little of us?' A clue to Dempsey's mindset is that he was one of only two of the 24 Fifa voters who did not take up any of the numerous invitations they received to visit South Africa and assess first-hand the rainbow nation's readiness to host the 2006 tournament. He always claimed he was too busy, yet managed to find the time for regular trips back to Britain and Europe, often to watch big football matches such as the FA Cup Final and the final of the European Champions League. 'As a Fifa executive member you're meant to at least pretend that you're objective in the bidding for the World Cup, and show some interest in what the rival countries have to offer, but he didn't even bother doing that with us,' said the South African. Across South Africa last Thursday, tens of thousands of people gathered from early morning in Soweto, Johannesburg and Cape Town for what they expected would be confirmation that, at last, South Africa had been deemed worthy of hosting the World Cup. Events that were planned as street parties instead became a series of public wakes as the news filtered through at lunchtime from Zurich that Germany, hosts as recently as 1974, had got it again. 'We have lost a great opportunity to focus the world's attention on our country which has its problems, admittedly, but is working harder to get things right,' said one campaigner. 'Being in the spotlight would have made us work harder and strive harder.' While the tournament will make little difference to Germany's already strong economy, it would have really boosted South Africa's economic base and reputation. Danny Jordaan, its bid chief, estimated that 2006 would have created 300,000 jobs in the country's hotels, construction industry and transport infrastructure. 'Manchester United's turnover is greater than the combined turnover of all the football played in Africa, Asia and Oceania, and that cannot be right,' said Jordaan. All those grievances will have to wait at least another four years. Fifa president Sepp Blatter was the biggest supporter of South Africa's bid and, as the vote loomed, Nelson Mandela, hero of South Africa's long struggle against apartheid, was pressed into action. He rang several heads of state, including the Emir of Qatar and the Kings of Thailand and Belgium, and pleaded with them to persuade their voters to back South Africa. Mandela also rang Dempsey, who implied that he would make South Africa his second preference. In the first round of voting Germany scored ten to South Africa's six, while England got five and Morocco were eliminated with just three. England disappeared in the second round after Dempsey and Fifa vice-president David Will, another Fifa vice-president, were their only supporters. The two main contenders each got 11. At that point New Zealand's man left the room and headed to Zurich airport, where he caught a flight for Auckland via Singapore. The media pursued him all the way. BBC Radio Five Live secured an interview in which, his voice failing, Dempsey explained that he had been under unspecified 'unsustainable pressure'. But a key element of that, a fax pushed under his door at 5.30 that morning which seemed to be offering bribes in return for supporting Germany, turned out to be a hoax. Dempsey was motivated more by his own strong dislike of Blatter than his undoubted pro-European view of world football. On 28 May, the Fifa president had publicly rebuked him at Oceania's annual congress for planning to waste his vote on England and Germany when he should be backing South Africa.

With Dempsey gone, that meant they defeated the South Africans 12-11. If the Fifa refusenik has stayed and done as Oceania had wanted, it would have been 12-12 and instead South Africa would have won, courtesy of Blatter's casting vote. Jordaan railed against the outcome, saying: 'We talk about \"the family of football\" but it's not really a family when the mother only feeds one of her children.' Despite talk of a legal challenge to the result, South Africa's only real consolation is that widespread anger at last week's proceedings means it will almost certainly be given the 2010 competition. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>The action was to be relayed live from the Pacific to a big screen at Boeing's East Coast headquarters in Virginia. The atmosphere was relaxed and confident. A senior Pentagon official, Ed Hudak, ran a simulation of what was intended to be a seamless operation - a third and decisive test of a missile defence system that would push the United States into a new generation of nuclear weaponry.</p> <p>After a two-hour delay while technicians fixed a last-minute glitch, a 37-year-old remodelled Minuteman rocket containing a mock warhead and a decoy balloon thundered aloft from a tightly guarded launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base, 125 miles north of Los Angeles. Twenty-one minutes later, an interceptor missile carrying the 'kill' vehicle ripped into the daytime sky from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific.</p> <p>The kill vehicle was supposed to separate from the second-stage rocket booster exactly 2 minutes and 37 seconds into flight, then manoeuvre itself into the path of the mock warhead. Hudak alerted the watchers as interception neared. 'It'll be eight minutes after the launch,' he said.</p> <p>The clock ticked on past nine minutes. 'We should have had confirmation by now,' said Hudak, as the screen remained a sickly green colour, with no sign of the flash that would signify success. Nearly half an hour passed before officials who monitored the test from a basement office in the Pentagon reported that the interceptor missile had missed.</p> <p>Without making an announcement, Boeing and Defence Department officials transported the entire gathering through dead of night to the Pentagon. There, at a dramatic briefing lasting until 2.30am, we heard that one of the most technologically adventurous experiments ever mounted by the Defence Department had floundered for a banal low-tech reason. The booster had failed to separate and launch the 'Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle'.</p> <p>General Ronald Kadish looked like a melting waxwork. 'What this tells me is that we have a lot of engineering work left to do. This is a challenge; this is rocket science.' The thought that the booster would not release the kill vehicle 'wasn't even on my list of potential problems', he said. It had not received the necessary signal.</p> <p>The Pentagon's head of weapons procurement, Under-Secretary Dr Chuck Gansler, emphasised that the problem was a basic one. 'We still want to see the end game, the interception of the missile. Would we like to have more data? Of course we would. But we are where we are.'</p> <p>The test was intended to be the gateway to the most important policy decision of President Clinton's eight years in office: whether to proceed with the embryonic National Missile Defence system - a revival of the Star Wars programme. This was supposed to be the missile defence shield that would take the US into the next phase of the military world order, and - say its critics - run the risk of detonating another arms race.</p> <p>The test was the decisive one of three: last October a 'kill vehicle' pulverised a dummy missile, but in January missed another by 141ft.</p> <p>This is not quite Star Wars as pioneered by the Reagan Administration, since the 'kill vehicle' is terrestrially (not space) based, but it is a version of the same vision - hitting a bullet with a bullet. But yesterday the project seemed doomed. The technical problems make it almost impossible for the Pentagon to recommend pursuit of the high-speed timetable set down for the missile shield. They also reinforce a host of political and strategic objections.</p> <p>Indeed, there were reports of secret relief inside the White House, which has been ambivalent about the missile shield since a bipartisan vote in Congress last year mandated the President and the Pentagon to develop an heir to Star Wars. The vote leaves Clinton legally obliged to decide whether to go ahead this summer.</p> <p>The scope of the project is awesome: proceeding in four stages from an initial 20 missile interceptors in 2005 to a fleet, by 2011, of 250 'exoatmospheric kill vehicles' in underground silos across Alaska and North Dakota, to be unleashed and guided by a global network of three command centres and five communications relay stations using 29 satellites and 15 space-based radar stations.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, in a conference room on the seventh floor of CIA headquarters, the agency's director, George Tenet, will convene probably the most important meeting of his career: a multi-agency cabal tasked to confront a cacophony of objections and give its 'National Intelligence Estimate'. The meeting will be attended by the Pentagon, the Defence Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and various mapping and satellite bureaux.</p> <p>On the agenda will be non-technical objections from both within and without the US, and indeed within the intelligence services themselves. Principal among these will be the fears of Russia and China. Russia has made its opposition clear, with President Putin working to win over sympathy and support in both western and eastern Europe for his view that the defence screen is an abrogation of three decades of arms control treaties and constitutes a bellicose return to the arms race.</p> <p>What the intelligence community has to gauge is whether deployment would cause the Russians to abandon arms control and prompt China to enlarge its own nuclear arsenal. The bedrock decision to be made on the basis of the intelligence report will be Clinton's this summer, but if the shield were to go ahead the deployment and targeting orders would follow in 2003, thereby becoming the single most momentous task of the next president.</p> <p>There is no debate between Vice-President Al Gore and Republican challenger George Bush on the need for a screen, but there is a world of difference between how far - in terms of cost, geography, technology and bellicosity - each wants to go. And on how far each is prepared to go in overturning decades of doctrine that kept the peace throughout the Cold War.</p> <p>The United States and Russia are still bound by the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty of 1972, which banned the deployment of missile defence systems, under the notion that the best way of preserving peace is the doctrine of MAD (mutual assured destruction), whereby no one would risk a nuclear attack for fear of the finality of retribution.</p> <p>During the Reagan years, both the US and USSR experimented with Star Wars projects (the Americans were way ahead) on the premise that defence is the best form of attack. The idea was that the ability to take out incoming missiles would lead - as Paul Warnke, President Carter's negotiator, put it to The Observer - 'to the terrifying notion that you might just catch it right, and actually be able to fight and win a nuclear war'.</p> <p>Gore has said he is ready to negotiate with Putin's post-Communist Russia on changes to the ABM treaty which allow for defensive systems. But he has refused to rule out the possibility of unilaterally breaching the treaty if he thought such a step was 'necessary to US security'.</p> <p>Bush advances Gore's position by leaps and bounds. He has pledged to rip the ABM treaty to shreds, if necessary, in pursuit of an unequivocal return to Reagan's Star Wars, deploying a comprehensive shield system of space, ground and sea-based missiles.</p> <p>The Bush programme would not be limited to the Alaska 'front' or indeed to the US. 'Our missile defence,' said Bush, 'must be designed to protect all 50 states, and our friends and allies and forces deployed overseas.'</p> <p>In terms of cost, the Clinton-Gore version has been estimated at $60 billion, while experts calculate the Bush plan would come in at three times that amount.</p> <p>China has warned that it will escalate its own missile-building and modernisation programme, which has come under particular scrutiny by US intelligence since the leak of core secrets from the nuclear laboratory in Los Alamos.</p> <p>The problems proliferate in the post-Cold War disorder, since a revived and accelerated arms race would no longer involve two opposing blocks, around the US and USSR as of old, but a miasma of 'sideshow' nuclear powers with their own priorities and concerns.</p> <p>Officials at the State Department tell The Observer that they will want to discuss the possible 'card deck effect' of a build-up by Beijing. They fear that China's nemesis in Asia, India, will then feel obliged to accelerate its missile programme, which in turn would lead to a retaliatory programme by India's bitter rival in the sub-continent: Pakistan.</p> <p>Even without Putin's recent burst of shuttle diplomacy across Europe to argue against a US missile shield, there were deep concerns among America's allies.</p> <p>The US intelligence agencies will examine in detail the threats to America posed by missile programmes in North Korea, Iraq and Iran - upon which the need for the defence screen is publicly justified by the administration, the Pentagon and the Bush camp.

On Tuesday morning, in a conference room on the seventh floor of CIA headquarters, the agency's director, George Tenet, will convene probably the most important meeting of his career: a multi-agency cabal tasked to confront a cacophony of objections and give its 'National Intelligence Estimate'.

There is no debate between Vice-President Al Gore and Republican challenger George Bush on the need for a screen, but there is a world of difference between how far - in terms of cost, geography, technology and bellicosity - each wants to go. And on how far each is prepared to go in overturning decades of doctrine that kept the peace throughout the Cold War. The United States and Russia are still bound by the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty of 1972, which banned the deployment of missile defence systems, under the notion that the best way of preserving peace is the doctrine of MAD (mutual assured destruction), whereby no one would risk a nuclear attack for fear of the finality of retribution. During the Reagan years, both the US and USSR experimented with Star Wars projects (the Americans were way ahead) on the premise that defence is the best form of attack.

The Bush programme would not be limited to the Alaska 'front' or indeed to the US. 'Our missile defence,' said Bush, 'must be designed to protect all 50 states, and our friends and allies and forces deployed overseas.' In terms of cost, the Clinton-Gore version has been estimated at $60 billion, while experts calculate the Bush plan would come in at three times that amount. China has warned that it will escalate its own missile-building and modernisation programme, which has come under particular scrutiny by US intelligence since the leak of core secrets from the nuclear laboratory in Los Alamos. The problems proliferate in the post-Cold War disorder, since a revived and accelerated arms race would no longer involve two opposing blocks, around the US and USSR as of old, but a miasma of 'sideshow' nuclear powers with their own priorities and concerns. Officials at the State Department tell The Observer that they will want to discuss the possible 'card deck effect' of a build-up by Beijing. They fear that China's nemesis in Asia, India, will then feel obliged to accelerate its missile programme, which in turn would lead to a retaliatory programme by India's bitter rival in the sub-continent: Pakistan. Even without Putin's recent burst of shuttle diplomacy across Europe to argue against a US missile shield, there were deep concerns among America's allies. The US intelligence agencies will examine in detail the threats to America posed by missile programmes in North Korea, Iraq and Iran - upon which the need for the defence screen is publicly justified by the administration, the Pentagon and the Bush camp. But German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der leads a view that even taking the 'rogue' states into consideration there remains no threat to Western security sufficient to warrant what is in effect a continuation of a Cold War programme. Another concern in European Nato-member capitals is that the new screen will mean the US departing from the alliance and going its own way in defence policy, without taking a Nato consensus with it.

      "body": "<p>The catch of fish was good this morning, and because the coffee season is beginning, swollen sacks of beans lie scattered in the dirt like great brown maggots. A few yards away, beside the boats drawn up along the shores of Lake Victoria, the marabou storks skip and glide from one fish head to another.</p> <p>Kasensero looks as dirty and dissolute as it ever did, as the sun burns down on its tumbledown shacks of wood and corrugated iron. Now is the season for making money and the village is full of young fishermen and smugglers, and young women with dyed hair. There is a constant hubbub of shouting and laughter, flirting and argument, intertwined with the lingala music that booms from the tiny bars and cafes. Although it is not yet noon, many are already drunk.</p> <p>One mile away, in the relative calm of the landing site at the mouth of the Kagera river, the man in charge tells us that Kasensero never changes - that the young still make money, have sex, and forget to use condoms.</p> <p>This, for me, is a journey back in time. For this small smuggling village is the place that I and a fellow-journalist first visited in 1986, after tales of the cataclysm along Uganda's southern border began filtering up to Kampala.</p> <p>The people told us, almost casually, how 'Slim disease' had arrived in their midst four or five years earlier, and how more than 100 of Kasensero's itinerant population of 500 had died since then. Then they called a meeting beneath the big tree, and asked us what to do about it. Acutely aware of our amateur status, we did our best. Use condoms, we said. If you have an injection, make sure the needle is first boiled. By good fortune, the advice was sound, and nowadays it is echoed by posters on display in the village - posters that are all too often ignored. The only thing that has changed in 14 years is the name. These days, everyone calls it Aids.</p> <p>Happily, the stubborn, hedonistic fatalism of Kasensero is not typical of Uganda as a whole, where the norm nowadays is to 'love carefully', to use condoms. Elsewhere in Africa, however, there are still many such venues, and wherever they exist, they fuel infection rates in surrounding areas. So it is that over two-thirds of the estimated 53 million people who have become infected with human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) since the start of the pandemic have been from Africa.</p> <p>Back in 1986, we spent four days travelling around Kasensero and its neighbouring villages, until we realised that we were witnessing something momentous and strange. Aids had been seen before in specific groups such as gays, drug users and haemophiliacs, and in hospital beds across central Africa, but what we were witnessing was the first community-wide Aids epidemic in the world. Men, women and children were all affected, and we rushed back to Europe and America to tell the story.</p> <p>In 1995 my friend, the late great evolutionary biologist Bill Hamilton, visited to get an update on the situation and brought back sad news about the men who had escorted us through the villages in 1986 - the tall, dignified district chairman, Joseph Ssebyoto-Lutaya, and the ever-smiling medical assistant, Jimmy Ssemambo. Both had died of Aids.</p> <p>Now, 14 years after that initial visit, I call at Joseph's house, in the village of Kyebe, near Kasensero, to offer my respects. His wife, it turns out, died a few months after him, but their 10 children all survive, and thankfully all look healthy. The younger ones are still cared for by their grandparents, who live in the house next door to Joseph's, beside the concrete graves among the banana trees. These children are lucky. So many houses around here now lie deserted, abandoned - their former occupants either dead, or scattered to the winds.</p> <p>I am here in Uganda with a Channel 4 news team, to help them prepare a front-line report ahead of the thirteenth International Conference on Aids, which opens in Durban today. There has been a belated acceleration of interest in Aids and Africa over the past few months. Partly this has been because of the conference, but partly because of other events including the ill-judged comments of South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, questioning whether HIV actually causes Aids, which have provided unmerited oxygen for the moribund hypothesis of Professor Peter Duesberg. And at long last, international donors such as the US and Britain have made significant contributions.</p> <p>In addition, my book The River seems to have ignited a major scientific debate about how Aids started in Africa. This pleases me, for the book was an obsession and a labour of love. It took more than nine years to research and write and included more than 600 interviews with scientists. What I was stunned to discover was that a perfectly sound and scientific explanation for the origin of Aids had been casually - and irresponsibly - dismissed by the scientific establishment. Now, as a result of the controversy, a two-day conference on 'The Origins of HIV and Aids' will be held at the Royal Society in London in September.</p> <p>My central hypothesis was that the Aids pandemic was sparked by an experimental oral polio vaccine (OPV) called CHAT, which was fed to more than a million infants, children and adults in the former Belgian colonies of central Africa between 1957 and 1960. It is now accepted that the immediate ancestor of HIV-1 is the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) of the common chimpanzee. In the late Fifties, polio vaccines were grown in cells from monkey kidneys, but evidence suggests that some batches of the CHAT vaccine fed in Africa were, uniquely, produced in chimp cells.</p> <p>By contrast, the hypothesis to which most Aids researchers still subscribe is that the virus was originally acquired by a hunter or market-woman, perhaps with cut hands, who butchered a chimp for bushmeat. When asked 'Why now?' (for chimps have been hunted and eaten since time immemorial), the reply of 'cut hunter' proponents is that it was probably decolonisation, leading to urbanisation and new sexual interactions, that allowed the newly acquired chimp virus to break free from its rural hearth, to proliferate in an urban environment, and then to spread across Africa.</p> <p>On the face of it, the cut-hunter theory seems plausible. On the other hand, the CHAT hypothesis fits the known facts considerably better. For example, it is now known that the CHAT researchers had a chimpanzee camp at Lindi, just outside Stanleyville (now Kisangani) in the then Belgian Congo, and that between 1956 and 1958, some 400 chimpanzees were held there, of which nearly 300 were first used to test the polio vaccine, and then sacrificed. According to a growing number of witnesses, both kidneys and blood were extracted shortly before sacrifice, and were then dispatched in flasks to Philadelphia and to Belgium, the two places where the CHAT vaccine used in Africa was made.</p> <p>Then there are the astounding correlations between CHAT vaccination sites and early Aids. Fully 64 per cent of the first Aids cases seen in Africa (up to and including 1980) come from the same towns and villages (all in the former Belgian colonies of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi) where CHAT was fed in the Fifties. Furthermore, every single one of the 46 earliest HIV-positive blood samples from Africa comes from within 140 miles of a CHAT vaccination site.</p> <p>Reviews of The River have generally acknowledged that the CHAT theory is plausible, albeit unproven. However, earlier this year, researchers led by Bette Korber placed the last common ancestor of all the HIV-1 variants seen today (which she called 'the Eve virus') in 1931, plus or minus 10 to 20 years. Since this was before the CHAT trials began, Korber pronounced the polio vaccine theory 'highly unlikely'.</p> <p>Many US journalists assumed that this theoretical data settled the issue, which it most certainly did not. Korber's mentor and former boss, Gerry Myers, will oppose her position at the Royal Society conference pointing out that Korber's dating says nothing about when chimpanzee SIVs transferred to humans and that the new data supports the CHAT theory better than the cut-hunter position.</p> <p>This and other counter-arguments to CHAT will all be addressed at the London meeting. It is worth noting, however, that none of the opposing scientists has thus far come up with data or arguments to refute the theory.</p> <p>The conference was initially proposed by Hamilton, who was a leading scientific supporter of the CHAT theory for many years. In January, he travelled to Kisangani (by then in the midst of civil war) to collect shit samples from chimpanzees to see whether any were SIV-infected. Tragically, he contracted malaria and, shortly after his return to England, died.</p> <p>Since then, there has been a concerted attempt by some of those who made the vaccine, or who support the cut-hunter theory, to scupper the conference. First, several 'cut-hunters' who had previously agreed to speak, withdrew. They later relented, but only after the meeting was postponed from May to September, and they had been allotted extra speakers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a series of extraordinary public and private attacks have been mounted against Hamilton, myself and others who believe that the CHAT theory deserves a fair hearing, accusing all involved with organising the London meeting of being enemies of science.</p> <p>In fact, there are sound reasons for having the debate that so many wish to stifle. One is that knowledge of how a disease began often leads to a better understanding of how to cure, prevent or alleviate it. Another is that the CHAT story has important implications for future medical and scientific practice, at a time when we may be about to embark on other well-meaning, and potentially even more dangerous, biomedical interventions. These include xenotransplantation (placing animal organs in humans, together with whichever undiscovered viruses may be lurking within), and trials of live Aids vaccines (which have the potential to recombine with existing HIV variants, to devastating effect).</p> <p>In June 1981, a German missionary doctor, Margerete Bundschuh, saw five women from the Ugandan border regions with unusual bacterial infections of the groin and anus, together with a man whose penis was 'half rotted off'. Much later, she wrote to me to explain her sense that these conditions were complicated by serious immune-deficiency: 'We had the impressions - sex infection, three to six months of slow deterioration, then acute disease and death. At that time, there was no long stage of undetectable Aids.' Bundschuh worked at Mugana hospital, in northern Tanzania, on the smugglers' road leading to Lake Victoria and Kasensero, which would witness its first cases a few months later.</p> <p>In Tanzania, the new condition was christened 'Juliana' by local people; in Uganda, 'Slim'. This detail alone - that non-specialists realised a new disease had arrived - destroys the claims by Peter Duesberg that the Aids epidemic in Africa is merely a collection of ancient diseases, to which Western doctors have ascribed a new name.</p> <p>So how did HIV-1 arrive along the Uganda/Tanzania borders? This coffee-growing region receives many Hutu migrant workers from Burundi and Rwanda, so it is possible that one of these was the carrier. However, there is an alternative explanation.</p> <p>In the early Sixties, hundreds of thousands of Tutsi refugees fled ethnic violence in Rwanda. In 1962, 3,000 of them were transferred to this region, and encouraged to settle. They came from Butare and Nyanza, two of the four 'territories' where CHAT vaccine was administered in Rwanda. Shortly afterwards, a two-year-old child from one of the settlement villages died of aggressive Kaposi's sarcoma - a possible early case of Aids.</p> <p>This same region later experienced a series of upheavals. In 1978, Idi Amin's army invaded the Kagera salient of northern Tanzania, and Julius Nyerere summoned 45,000 troops to oppose him. For three months they trained intensively for the counter-invasion.</p> <p>Seven thousand men from the 207th brigade camped out on an open, grassy plain beside the village of Bugandika. Local men told us that there were many instances of rape, and that: 'Soldiers came and went from village houses. There were many divorces. Girls and mothers came here from far away for meat and beer.' Bugandika lies just nine miles from Mugana hospital, at the foot of the smugglers' road.</p> <p>It seems likely that someone who spent time at that camp, a soldier or a female visitor, was already infected with HIV and that - just as with the gay bath-houses in America at around the same time - a seed was planted in a fertile environment. From Bugandika, the 207th took a route north which was different to those of other Tanzanian brigades. It crossed into Uganda at Joseph Ssebyoto-Lutaya's village, Kyebe, and then moved north through Kyotera and Masaka to Kampala, which it occupied until the Tanzanian withdrawal in 1981. By 1987, a quarter of the women in Masaka and Kampala were HIV-positive, while Kyebe and Kyotera were famous as epicentres of Aids.</p> <p>In 1987 Uganda initiated the first Aids Control Programme in Africa, and began a campaign of health education that continues to this day, with posters, TV ads, lessons in schools and villages, and the popular radio show Straight Talk. The rewards are there to be seen. A few days ago, President Yoweri Museveni announced that national (adult) HIV-prevalence had fallen from 30 per cent in 1992 to under 10 per cent today.</p> <p>Last weekend, Bill Hamilton's memorial service took place at New College, Oxford. I booked an early flight home from Uganda, and made it with minutes to spare. Bill's family, friends and a large contingent of the great and the good were there. Mike Worobey, one of his two young Canadian companions on the fateful Congo expedition, spoke movingly of his 'last bite', delivered by one of several safari ants. Richard Dawkins, who organised the service, quoted liberally from the many obituaries, before adding John Maynard Smith's magnanimous conclusion that Hamilton was 'the only bloody genius we had'.</p> <p>It was remarkable to see so many eminent professors with tears in their eyes. This was a tribute not just to the brilliance of the man, but to his humanity. Dawkins spoke also of Hamilton's championing of the 'unfashionable - even reviled' polio vaccine theory. He added later that 'Bill was usually right'.</p> <p>Whatever the truth of how Aids began, Africans, tragically, are taking the brunt. Of the 19 million who have died globally, probably 15 million have been African. Half of all 15-year-olds in Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa can expect to die of Aids. This is an unprecedented cataclysm - and it needs an unprecedented response.</p> <p>This morning, as the Durban Aids conference opens, this is what African doctors and scientists are saying Africa needs - and needs urgently:</p> <p>* more needles, syringes, gloves, gowns and protective gear, so that the virus is not transmitted unnecessarily to health personnel, or to other patients.</p> <p>* more drugs, to alleviate the symptoms of Aids.</p> <p>* more antiseptic solutions and IV drips; more linen, bedding and beds.</p> <p>* more HIV test kits.</p> <p>* more money for the training and support of doctors, nurses and counsellors.</p> <p>* more condoms.</p> <p>* more and better focused health education, especially for the young. Repeat twice over.</p> <p>These are the simple things that work, that save lives. In comparison, anti-retroviral treatments can be afforded by very few, and most African countries lack health systems that can deliver and monitor the drugs.</p> <p>In addition, more support is needed for social interventions which might massively reduce onward transmission. Some of these could be quite painful, but could be effected, given the political will. Let the Catholic Church match its compassion with pragmatism, and tell its congregations that condoms may be used to protect lives. Let Africa's politicians and ethnic leaders tell their peoples that male circumcision can reduce the risk of contracting HIV during sex. And let a concerted effort be made to elevate the position of women in African society.</p> <p>If the oral polio vaccine theory should come to be proved, it is my belief that an overwhelmingly dreadful and difficult lesson will eventually be learnt. Vaccines save millions of lives. But new vaccines - including Aids vaccines - need to be tested appropriately and rigorously before they are released. New medical and genetic interventions likewise must be tested to exhaustion, even if that means more money is spent, and even if the potential benefits are delayed.</p> <p>But, if CHAT/Aids were proved correct, I believe it would help nobody for the original researchers, or even the institutions or governments that supported them, to be deemed legally culpable. At its core, the CHAT vaccine story involved an attempt to help people, not to kill them. In science, as in other walks of life, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In this case, it was also paved with paternalism and a tendency to exploit groups that did not control their own destinies. Like other polio vaccines, CHAT was tested first on the handicapped, then on prisoners. Finally, one million Africans were 'volunteered' for vaccination by their colonial masters.</p> <p>Nowadays, this process is being presented by some of the vaccine-makers as a heroic attempt to curb polio epidemics in Africa. This is largely incorrect. In the Fifties, polio was a Western scourge - 95 per cent of Africans were naturally immune to the virus by the age of five. Essentially, the great majority of African CHAT vaccinees were used as guinea-pigs to safety-test a Western vaccine.</p> <p>In Kampala, Uganda, the first Aids vaccine trials are now taking place on 40 volunteers. Virologists say that to be effective, an Aids vaccine needs to be tested in an area of high HIV-prevalence, and that Africa affords a more logical setting for trials than the US or Europe. The trials have received full approval and co-operation from the Ugandan government.</p> <p>And yet the vaccine has been prepared against HIV-1 subtype B, the so-called Euro-American strain, and one which is hardly, if at all, found in Africa. Ugandan researchers say they want to see if a vaccine against one subtype can protect against others, and add that the vaccine-makers have promised a vaccine against subtypes A and D (which are prevalent in Uganda) within two or three years. However, there is already evidence from chimpanzee trials which suggests a vaccine prepared against one subtype does not protect against others. So are the mistakes of the past happening again?</p> <p>If Aids was a Western medical error, then there surely has to be a change in Western approaches to helping Africa and Asia cope with their spiralling epidemics. At the very least, this would involve Western governments (especially those of the US and Belgium) accepting responsibility for the devastation caused by past paternalism, past mistakes.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the US committed $254m to fighting Aids overseas, and declared the global situation 'a threat to national security'. There was no mention of the threat to African security and, though welcome, the donation smacked of pre-emptive action ahead of Durban. The World Bank reckons Africa needs more like $2 billion; others place it higher.</p> <p>Law suits and reparations are not the way forward. What might help Africa, however, is a different scale of financial commitment, a different set of ethical standards. Cancelling Third World debt might be a start.

      "bodyText": "The catch of fish was good this morning, and because the coffee season is beginning, swollen sacks of beans lie scattered in the dirt like great brown maggots. A few yards away, beside the boats drawn up along the shores of Lake Victoria, the marabou storks skip and glide from one fish head to another. Kasensero looks as dirty and dissolute as it ever did, as the sun burns down on its tumbledown shacks of wood and corrugated iron. Now is the season for making money and the village is full of young fishermen and smugglers, and young women with dyed hair. There is a constant hubbub of shouting and laughter, flirting and argument, intertwined with the lingala music that booms from the tiny bars and cafes. Although it is not yet noon, many are already drunk. One mile away, in the relative calm of the landing site at the mouth of the Kagera river, the man in charge tells us that Kasensero never changes - that the young still make money, have sex, and forget to use condoms. This, for me, is a journey back in time. For this small smuggling village is the place that I and a fellow-journalist first visited in 1986, after tales of the cataclysm along Uganda's southern border began filtering up to Kampala. The people told us, almost casually, how 'Slim disease' had arrived in their midst four or five years earlier, and how more than 100 of Kasensero's itinerant population of 500 had died since then. Then they called a meeting beneath the big tree, and asked us what to do about it. Acutely aware of our amateur status, we did our best. Use condoms, we said. If you have an injection, make sure the needle is first boiled. By good fortune, the advice was sound, and nowadays it is echoed by posters on display in the village - posters that are all too often ignored. The only thing that has changed in 14 years is the name. These days, everyone calls it Aids. Happily, the stubborn, hedonistic fatalism of Kasensero is not typical of Uganda as a whole, where the norm nowadays is to 'love carefully', to use condoms. Elsewhere in Africa, however, there are still many such venues, and wherever they exist, they fuel infection rates in surrounding areas. So it is that over two-thirds of the estimated 53 million people who have become infected with human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) since the start of the pandemic have been from Africa. Back in 1986, we spent four days travelling around Kasensero and its neighbouring villages, until we realised that we were witnessing something momentous and strange. Aids had been seen before in specific groups such as gays, drug users and haemophiliacs, and in hospital beds across central Africa, but what we were witnessing was the first community-wide Aids epidemic in the world. Men, women and children were all affected, and we rushed back to Europe and America to tell the story. In 1995 my friend, the late great evolutionary biologist Bill Hamilton, visited to get an update on the situation and brought back sad news about the men who had escorted us through the villages in 1986 - the tall, dignified district chairman, Joseph Ssebyoto-Lutaya, and the ever-smiling medical assistant, Jimmy Ssemambo. Both had died of Aids. Now, 14 years after that initial visit, I call at Joseph's house, in the village of Kyebe, near Kasensero, to offer my respects. His wife, it turns out, died a few months after him, but their 10 children all survive, and thankfully all look healthy. The younger ones are still cared for by their grandparents, who live in the house next door to Joseph's, beside the concrete graves among the banana trees. These children are lucky. So many houses around here now lie deserted, abandoned - their former occupants either dead, or scattered to the winds. I am here in Uganda with a Channel 4 news team, to help them prepare a front-line report ahead of the thirteenth International Conference on Aids, which opens in Durban today. There has been a belated acceleration of interest in Aids and Africa over the past few months. Partly this has been because of the conference, but partly because of other events including the ill-judged comments of South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, questioning whether HIV actually causes Aids, which have provided unmerited oxygen for the moribund hypothesis of Professor Peter Duesberg. And at long last, international donors such as the US and Britain have made significant contributions. In addition, my book The River seems to have ignited a major scientific debate about how Aids started in Africa. This pleases me, for the book was an obsession and a labour of love. It took more than nine years to research and write and included more than 600 interviews with scientists. What I was stunned to discover was that a perfectly sound and scientific explanation for the origin of Aids had been casually - and irresponsibly - dismissed by the scientific establishment. Now, as a result of the controversy, a two-day conference on 'The Origins of HIV and Aids' will be held at the Royal Society in London in September. My central hypothesis was that the Aids pandemic was sparked by an experimental oral polio vaccine (OPV) called CHAT, which was fed to more than a million infants, children and adults in the former Belgian colonies of central Africa between 1957 and 1960. It is now accepted that the immediate ancestor of HIV-1 is the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) of the common chimpanzee. In the late Fifties, polio vaccines were grown in cells from monkey kidneys, but evidence suggests that some batches of the CHAT vaccine fed in Africa were, uniquely, produced in chimp cells. By contrast, the hypothesis to which most Aids researchers still subscribe is that the virus was originally acquired by a hunter or market-woman, perhaps with cut hands, who butchered a chimp for bushmeat. When asked 'Why now?' (for chimps have been hunted and eaten since time immemorial), the reply of 'cut hunter' proponents is that it was probably decolonisation, leading to urbanisation and new sexual interactions, that allowed the newly acquired chimp virus to break free from its rural hearth, to proliferate in an urban environment, and then to spread across Africa. On the face of it, the cut-hunter theory seems plausible. On the other hand, the CHAT hypothesis fits the known facts considerably better. For example, it is now known that the CHAT researchers had a chimpanzee camp at Lindi, just outside Stanleyville (now Kisangani) in the then Belgian Congo, and that between 1956 and 1958, some 400 chimpanzees were held there, of which nearly 300 were first used to test the polio vaccine, and then sacrificed. According to a growing number of witnesses, both kidneys and blood were extracted shortly before sacrifice, and were then dispatched in flasks to Philadelphia and to Belgium, the two places where the CHAT vaccine used in Africa was made. Then there are the astounding correlations between CHAT vaccination sites and early Aids. Fully 64 per cent of the first Aids cases seen in Africa (up to and including 1980) come from the same towns and villages (all in the former Belgian colonies of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi) where CHAT was fed in the Fifties. Furthermore, every single one of the 46 earliest HIV-positive blood samples from Africa comes from within 140 miles of a CHAT vaccination site. Reviews of The River have generally acknowledged that the CHAT theory is plausible, albeit unproven. However, earlier this year, researchers led by Bette Korber placed the last common ancestor of all the HIV-1 variants seen today (which she called 'the Eve virus') in 1931, plus or minus 10 to 20 years. Since this was before the CHAT trials began, Korber pronounced the polio vaccine theory 'highly unlikely'. Many US journalists assumed that this theoretical data settled the issue, which it most certainly did not. Korber's mentor and former boss, Gerry Myers, will oppose her position at the Royal Society conference pointing out that Korber's dating says nothing about when chimpanzee SIVs transferred to humans and that the new data supports the CHAT theory better than the cut-hunter position. This and other counter-arguments to CHAT will all be addressed at the London meeting. It is worth noting, however, that none of the opposing scientists has thus far come up with data or arguments to refute the theory. The conference was initially proposed by Hamilton, who was a leading scientific supporter of the CHAT theory for many years. In January, he travelled to Kisangani (by then in the midst of civil war) to collect shit samples from chimpanzees to see whether any were SIV-infected. Tragically, he contracted malaria and, shortly after his return to England, died. Since then, there has been a concerted attempt by some of those who made the vaccine, or who support the cut-hunter theory, to scupper the conference. First, several 'cut-hunters' who had previously agreed to speak, withdrew. They later relented, but only after the meeting was postponed from May to September, and they had been allotted extra speakers. Meanwhile, a series of extraordinary public and private attacks have been mounted against Hamilton, myself and others who believe that the CHAT theory deserves a fair hearing, accusing all involved with organising the London meeting of being enemies of science. In fact, there are sound reasons for having the debate that so many wish to stifle. One is that knowledge of how a disease began often leads to a better understanding of how to cure, prevent or alleviate it. Another is that the CHAT story has important implications for future medical and scientific practice, at a time when we may be about to embark on other well-meaning, and potentially even more dangerous, biomedical interventions. These include xenotransplantation (placing animal organs in humans, together with whichever undiscovered viruses may be lurking within), and trials of live Aids vaccines (which have the potential to recombine with existing HIV variants, to devastating effect). In June 1981, a German missionary doctor, Margerete Bundschuh, saw five women from the Ugandan border regions with unusual bacterial infections of the groin and anus, together with a man whose penis was 'half rotted off'. Much later, she wrote to me to explain her sense that these conditions were complicated by serious immune-deficiency: 'We had the impressions - sex infection, three to six months of slow deterioration, then acute disease and death. At that time, there was no long stage of undetectable Aids.' Bundschuh worked at Mugana hospital, in northern Tanzania, on the smugglers' road leading to Lake Victoria and Kasensero, which would witness its first cases a few months later. In Tanzania, the new condition was christened 'Juliana' by local people; in Uganda, 'Slim'. This detail alone - that non-specialists realised a new disease had arrived - destroys the claims by Peter Duesberg that the Aids epidemic in Africa is merely a collection of ancient diseases, to which Western doctors have ascribed a new name. So how did HIV-1 arrive along the Uganda/Tanzania borders? This coffee-growing region receives many Hutu migrant workers from Burundi and Rwanda, so it is possible that one of these was the carrier. However, there is an alternative explanation. In the early Sixties, hundreds of thousands of Tutsi refugees fled ethnic violence in Rwanda. In 1962, 3,000 of them were transferred to this region, and encouraged to settle. They came from Butare and Nyanza, two of the four 'territories' where CHAT vaccine was administered in Rwanda. Shortly afterwards, a two-year-old child from one of the settlement villages died of aggressive Kaposi's sarcoma - a possible early case of Aids. This same region later experienced a series of upheavals. In 1978, Idi Amin's army invaded the Kagera salient of northern Tanzania, and Julius Nyerere summoned 45,000 troops to oppose him. For three months they trained intensively for the counter-invasion. Seven thousand men from the 207th brigade camped out on an open, grassy plain beside the village of Bugandika. Local men told us that there were many instances of rape, and that: 'Soldiers came and went from village houses. There were many divorces. Girls and mothers came here from far away for meat and beer.' Bugandika lies just nine miles from Mugana hospital, at the foot of the smugglers' road. It seems likely that someone who spent time at that camp, a soldier or a female visitor, was already infected with HIV and that - just as with the gay bath-houses in America at around the same time - a seed was planted in a fertile environment. From Bugandika, the 207th took a route north which was different to those of other Tanzanian brigades. It crossed into Uganda at Joseph Ssebyoto-Lutaya's village, Kyebe, and then moved north through Kyotera and Masaka to Kampala, which it occupied until the Tanzanian withdrawal in 1981. By 1987, a quarter of the women in Masaka and Kampala were HIV-positive, while Kyebe and Kyotera were famous as epicentres of Aids. In 1987 Uganda initiated the first Aids Control Programme in Africa, and began a campaign of health education that continues to this day, with posters, TV ads, lessons in schools and villages, and the popular radio show Straight Talk. The rewards are there to be seen. A few days ago, President Yoweri Museveni announced that national (adult) HIV-prevalence had fallen from 30 per cent in 1992 to under 10 per cent today. Last weekend, Bill Hamilton's memorial service took place at New College, Oxford. I booked an early flight home from Uganda, and made it with minutes to spare. Bill's family, friends and a large contingent of the great and the good were there. Mike Worobey, one of his two young Canadian companions on the fateful Congo expedition, spoke movingly of his 'last bite', delivered by one of several safari ants. Richard Dawkins, who organised the service, quoted liberally from the many obituaries, before adding John Maynard Smith's magnanimous conclusion that Hamilton was 'the only bloody genius we had'. It was remarkable to see so many eminent professors with tears in their eyes. This was a tribute not just to the brilliance of the man, but to his humanity. Dawkins spoke also of Hamilton's championing of the 'unfashionable - even reviled' polio vaccine theory. He added later that 'Bill was usually right'. Whatever the truth of how Aids began, Africans, tragically, are taking the brunt. Of the 19 million who have died globally, probably 15 million have been African. Half of all 15-year-olds in Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa can expect to die of Aids. This is an unprecedented cataclysm - and it needs an unprecedented response. This morning, as the Durban Aids conference opens, this is what African doctors and scientists are saying Africa needs - and needs urgently: * more needles, syringes, gloves, gowns and protective gear, so that the virus is not transmitted unnecessarily to health personnel, or to other patients. * more drugs, to alleviate the symptoms of Aids. * more antiseptic solutions and IV drips; more linen, bedding and beds. * more HIV test kits. * more money for the training and support of doctors, nurses and counsellors. * more condoms. * more and better focused health education, especially for the young. Repeat twice over. These are the simple things that work, that save lives. In comparison, anti-retroviral treatments can be afforded by very few, and most African countries lack health systems that can deliver and monitor the drugs. In addition, more support is needed for social interventions which might massively reduce onward transmission. Some of these could be quite painful, but could be effected, given the political will. Let the Catholic Church match its compassion with pragmatism, and tell its congregations that condoms may be used to protect lives. Let Africa's politicians and ethnic leaders tell their peoples that male circumcision can reduce the risk of contracting HIV during sex. And let a concerted effort be made to elevate the position of women in African society. If the oral polio vaccine theory should come to be proved, it is my belief that an overwhelmingly dreadful and difficult lesson will eventually be learnt. Vaccines save millions of lives. But new vaccines - including Aids vaccines - need to be tested appropriately and rigorously before they are released. New medical and genetic interventions likewise must be tested to exhaustion, even if that means more money is spent, and even if the potential benefits are delayed. But, if CHAT/Aids were proved correct, I believe it would help nobody for the original researchers, or even the institutions or governments that supported them, to be deemed legally culpable. At its core, the CHAT vaccine story involved an attempt to help people, not to kill them. In science, as in other walks of life, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In this case, it was also paved with paternalism and a tendency to exploit groups that did not control their own destinies. Like other polio vaccines, CHAT was tested first on the handicapped, then on prisoners. Finally, one million Africans were 'volunteered' for vaccination by their colonial masters. Nowadays, this process is being presented by some of the vaccine-makers as a heroic attempt to curb polio epidemics in Africa. This is largely incorrect. In the Fifties, polio was a Western scourge - 95 per cent of Africans were naturally immune to the virus by the age of five. Essentially, the great majority of African CHAT vaccinees were used as guinea-pigs to safety-test a Western vaccine. In Kampala, Uganda, the first Aids vaccine trials are now taking place on 40 volunteers. Virologists say that to be effective, an Aids vaccine needs to be tested in an area of high HIV-prevalence, and that Africa affords a more logical setting for trials than the US or Europe. The trials have received full approval and co-operation from the Ugandan government. And yet the vaccine has been prepared against HIV-1 subtype B, the so-called Euro-American strain, and one which is hardly, if at all, found in Africa. Ugandan researchers say they want to see if a vaccine against one subtype can protect against others, and add that the vaccine-makers have promised a vaccine against subtypes A and D (which are prevalent in Uganda) within two or three years. However, there is already evidence from chimpanzee trials which suggests a vaccine prepared against one subtype does not protect against others. So are the mistakes of the past happening again? If Aids was a Western medical error, then there surely has to be a change in Western approaches to helping Africa and Asia cope with their spiralling epidemics. At the very least, this would involve Western governments (especially those of the US and Belgium) accepting responsibility for the devastation caused by past paternalism, past mistakes. Earlier this year, the US committed $254m to fighting Aids overseas, and declared the global situation 'a threat to national security'. There was no mention of the threat to African security and, though welcome, the donation smacked of pre-emptive action ahead of Durban. The World Bank reckons Africa needs more like $2 billion; others place it higher. Law suits and reparations are not the way forward. What might help Africa, however, is a different scale of financial commitment, a different set of ethical standards. Cancelling Third World debt might be a start. And drug companies would earn enormous approval ratings were they to abandon the profit motive for a moment, and slash prices for Third World drugs and medical supplies Massive human support is needed too. Perhaps the setting up of a new agency, a revamped VSO and Peace Corps for the new millennium, run by Europeans, Americans, Africans and Asians which would allow caring, ethical, well-balanced and brave young people to channel those gap years to better purpose. The Hamilton Project? Perhaps in years to come, we will routinely watch our recent graduates, our unemployed but not yet feckless youth, going off to 'do a Bill'. \u00a9 Edward Hooper 2000.

Horrifying television pictures showed firefighters and police hauling the bodies of 22 victims from the wreckage of the coach, which was hit head-on by a farm lorry carrying pigs. The animals trapped at the bottom of the six-metre-deep ditch into which both the vehicles fell squealed as the rescue workers tried to help the 19 victims who were still alive - seven of these died subsequently. Parents wept and fainted as news of the crash reached two schools in Barcelona. Most set off for the city of Soria, close to the crash site north-east of Madrid, without knowing whether their children were dead or alive. On Friday, Queen Sof\u00eda led mourners at a mass funeral at Soria's football stadium, where Red Cross workers lined up the coffins of the victims: 23 teenagers and five adults, including both of the drivers. Police are investigating the cause of the crash, which took place in good visibility on a curving road at a point where the uphill lane doubles in size to allow for overtaking.

Car-owners who feel free to drink and drive and speed - not to mention the 'kamikaze drivers' who put money on their ability (or not) to drive the wrong way up a motorway at night - have helped Spain to climb to fourth place in the European league of road deaths. The summer months are the most dangerous, since the majority of Spaniards take their month-long holidays in July or August, and many still choose to take their vacations within the country. During the first weekend of July, police monitoring what is known as 'Operation Departure', were expecting about five million car journeys. Last year 3,642 people were killed in car crashes - 879 during July and August alone. According to a report published on Thursday, Spain has a traffic mortality rate of 151 dead per million inhabitants, compared to 61 in Britain.

The question now is whether this sense of public outrage that Irish politics are now a byword for corruption, can be harnessed behind a coherent political movement. Last week it was revealed that plans are already advanced for a new party which aims to campaign primarily on an anti-sleaze ticket, but has also developed policies on the environment, transport, health, education and other issues. Colm Mac Eochaidh has already established his campaigning credentials. A 37-year-old barrister, he was one of the two people behind an advertisement placed in the Irish Times five years ago which had a dramatic, some would say apocalyptic, impact on Irish politics. Mac Eochaidh and Michael Smith, another barrister concerned with environmental issues, offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information leading to convictions for corruption in the planning system in Dublin. They decided on this tactic after a series of investigations by the Irish police failed to yield results. Their advertisement, placed for them by a firm of solicitors in Newry because nobody south of the border would touch it, led to the resignation of Ray Burke, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the establishment of the Flood Tribunal, which has heard evidence of widespread abuse of the planning system.

Computer failures at the London air traffic control centre, strikes by French controllers and threats of industrial action in Greece and Belgium have already caused travel chaos and worse is to come. There is speculation that Spanish air traffic controllers could take industrial action as the summer season reaches its peak, when school holidays start later this month. And there is no guarantee that the outdated equipment at West Drayton, near Heathrow, which covers traffic using the southern part of Britain and aircraft overflying the UK, will not suffer further glitches. The International Air Transport Association said this weekend that the official forecast for European flight delays this year was 30 million minutes - the equivalent of 57 years. But the unofficial prediction is higher. The association received verbal warnings from the European air traffic control co-ordinating body, Eurocontrol, in Brussels that delays will exceed 40 million minutes during 2000, most of that during the summer. 'It is unacceptable. It can be a nightmare for passengers,' said an official. Last summer was officially the worst of the Nineties as huge chunks of European air space were blocked off for use by the military during the conflict in Kosovo, resulting in 43 million minutes of delays.

The sporadic strike action on the Continent and unexpected system collapses at West Drayton so far this year have thrown normal operations into turmoil with little or no warning - leaving passengers stranded abroad or stuck at airports for days. Simon Evans, of the UK official travel watchdog the Air Transport Users' Council, said: 'It is outrageous that it is always the passenger that ends up suffering the consequences of these problems.' He criticised airlines for not doing enough to accommodate passengers when difficulties arose, keep them informed and get them to their destinations. With Europe's various state-owned air traffic control authorities immune from liability and some airlines refusing to reimburse passengers beyond a bare minimum one-way refund many were left out of pocket, Evans said. 'Airlines are often too stingy and disorganised to give delayed passengers the proper information, meal vouchers, accommodation or alternative flights. They are not obliged to do anything for you at all, and some don't,' he said. The major national airlines and those with high levels of business traffic have reportedly responded best to the chaos, but significant numbers of passengers have complained about the Luton-based low-cost airline EasyJet and the Irish budget carrier Ryanair. One couple complained that they were stranded in Barcelona on the Saturday that West Drayton had its problems last month and spent \u00a31,000 getting home via other airports after EasyJet cancelled almost its entire network and said it could not repatriate them until the following Wednesday.

Representatives of developing nations, led by China, the bank's largest borrower, had pushed the bank's board to finance the project and leave the details of its execution in the hands of bank managers.</p> <p>But leading Western nations, who largely fund the bank's loans, argued that the bank management had ignored its internal procedures when approving the project and had not considered its environmental and social effects properly.

He said: 'We regret that because of political opposition from some shareholders, the World Bank has lost a good opportunity to assist some of the poorest people in China.'</p> <p>Clare Short, the Secretary of State for International Development, called the outcome a 'Pyrrhic victory' for the scheme's opponents.

Saunders pointed out that bank involvement had cut back the number of settlers moved under the plan from more than 100,000 to 60,000.</p> <p>'China will now want to show that it can do it and that it can do it on its own terms,' she said.</p>",

However the proposed moving of tens of thousands of Han Chinese and Hui Muslims from the arid Hadong region in Eastern Qinghai province hundreds of miles west to better irrigated lands have been bitterly opposed by Tibetan groups. Qinghai, the Dalai Lama's birthplace, was part of Tibet when the country was invaded by the Chinese in 1951. The decision also sets an important precedent over the control of the tens of billions of pounds that the World Bank lends each year. Representatives of developing nations, led by China, the bank's largest borrower, had pushed the bank's board to finance the project and leave the details of its execution in the hands of bank managers. But leading Western nations, who largely fund the bank's loans, argued that the bank management had ignored its internal procedures when approving the project and had not considered its environmental and social effects properly. They said the board had to take a more active role in running lending programmes. The Chinese delegate to the bank, Zhu Xian, attributed the defeat to the 'enormous political pressures' brought to bear by wealthy nations and pledged that China would use its own money to finance the proposal. He said: 'We regret that because of political opposition from some shareholders, the World Bank has lost a good opportunity to assist some of the poorest people in China.' Clare Short, the Secretary of State for International Development, called the outcome a 'Pyrrhic victory' for the scheme's opponents. She said: 'World Bank involvement would have ensured that high social and environmental standards were adhered to.' Kate Saunders of the Tibet Information Network (TIN) said, although an important signal had been sent about international funding for projects in Tibet and globally, there were concerns that 'Beijing [would] take a tougher approach towards the project and possibly towards the whole question of development and resettlement in Tibetan areas.' Saunders pointed out that bank involvement had cut back the number of settlers moved under the plan from more than 100,000 to 60,000. 'China will now want to show that it can do it and that it can do it on its own terms,' she said.",

      "bodyText": "The old adage that words are not enough may have more than a ring of truth as scientists have discovered that the secret of communication is all in the hands. New research has shown that our hands - whether being shook or gesturing - give away more about us than we realise. Once thought of as meaningless and even distracting, hand gestures have been shown to be far more important than the spoken word in getting the message across. Professor Jana Iverson, of Missouri-Columbia University in the US, has completed two studies which may go some way to explain the mysterious importance Western society has always placed on people shaking hands. Psychologists, businessmen and interviewees have long known that a good handshake is crucial in creating a good first impression. A firm handshake means a person is open and confident with self-worth and assurance. A weak or limp handshake implies a person's personality is much the same and is likely to leave a longer-lasting impression on the other person than anything said. Body language has long been recognised as having importance. Politicians are carefully coached in what to do with their hands. US President Clinton's double grasp handshake - the free hand clasping the recipient's sleeve to emphasis his sincerity - is now famous. Tony Blair's hands are fond of stabbing around in the air and his handshake is said to have firmed up since he came to power. But the level of importance attached to handshakes in Iverson's latest research is startling. Her two studies have pointed to speech itself making up only 7 per cent of human communication while hand movements and body language make up well over 50 per cent. 'There is a common misconception that communicating is only speaking,' said Iverson. Her research included in-depth studies of the blind. In the first study she looked at blind adults and how they met and communicated with both sighted and other blind people. Hands were just as important when one blind person communicated with another despite the fact that the talker knew the other could not see his gestures. Iverson then went on to look at how communication skills develop in blind babies. She found that, despite never having seen their own hands, the children were learning to communicate with gestures well before they could talk. Her first study was published in the scientific journal Nature and the second study will be published later this year in the Journal of Non-Verbal Behaviour . She said: 'These studies support the theory that gestures not only help to convey meaning to the listener but also help to co-ordinate and facilitate the thinking process of the speaker.' No more should television presenters and politicians be coached to keep their hands still - by doing so they are curbing their powers of communication. The most famous British hand waver was the late Magnus Pike whose windmilling arms helped to get complex scientific theories across to television audiences. 'If people are not allowed to gesture it can interfere with their communication and thought processes and certain ideas or expressions may be more difficult to relay,' said Iverson. 'Gestures help us think about what we want to say and communicate effectively.' If there is anything we would like to keep secret from the rest of the world it is probably best to simply sit on our hands. tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk",

The trade union movement has always been internationalist in its outlook and rightly so.'

The attacker - known to wear gloves, a balaclava or a Dracula mask - has been preying on women and girls as young as 11 in the Hayling Island and Portsmouth areas of Hampshire since December last year. DNA tests have linked two attacks and police say all descriptions of the man show striking similarities. In the latest offence on Friday night, a 15-year-old girl was grabbed as she cycled along a disused railway on Hayling Island. The man wore a black woollen hat, grabbed her from behind, threatened to kill her, and tried to drag her into the bushes but she managed to struggle free. On 20 May, a 13-year-old girl suffered a horrific sex attack in the churchyard of St Mary's in Hayling Island. A man in a black balaclava threatened to kill her and tied her hands behind her back, using women's underwear. On 10 March, a woman was approached by a man at her front door on Hayling Island but shut the door on him. On 14 February, a 44-year-old woman fought off a man wearing a Halloween mask in Denvilles, Havant, and four days later a 51-year-old woman was attacked in a subway in Emsworth. Her attacker left behind his Dracula mask. The first attack was on 1 December last year when an 11-year-old girl was grabbed as she cycled along the same railway line as Friday night's victim, but she managed to struggle free. Police linked the attacks on the 13 and the 51-year-old and say all the attacks have similarities. The latest victim gave police the best description of him yet, saying he is aged 35-55, white, clean-shaven, 5ft 7in tall with short, greying hair and was physically slim and weak. A Hampshire police spokeswoman said: 'We must catch this man.'",

      "byline": "Interview Stephanie Dennison",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Helena Kennedy QC</strong><br> I'd just become a senior counsel in 1991 when I was briefed on a case involving the killing of a baby for which a young man, Brian Hedman, and woman, Sally Emery, were standing trial. I had a strong feeling that there was much more to this case than we were getting at. I was representing Emery, who was very careful not to say anything incriminating about her husband. They both denied the charges. But as she began to trust me, she began to unravel that she had been battered. </p> <p> I wanted someone who had a psychiatric background to see her, but at that time battered women's syndrome was still a year away from being a recognised psychiatric diagnosis. I remembered an article about the dynamics of women survivors and how often the men who were abusers were not the stereotype of the aggressor and the woman wasn't necessarily timid or passive. The author was Sandra Horley, director of the then Chiswick Women's Aid. </p> <p> The trial had already started when I phoned her. I knew it would be difficult to persuade the court to acknowledge her as an expert - it's easier if you have someone medically or scientifically qualified - yet there was probably no one more experienced than someone who'd worked in refuges for 20 years. I arranged to see her in chambers after court that day, to see whether she would make a good witness. </p> <p> Sandra arrived wearing a red cape and looked glamorous, which is a plus, because if someone looks interesting and likeable that's half the battle. I was thrilled because she defied the idea of a feminist adviser to battered women, she obviously liked men, she was highly informed and could clearly describe the dynamics operating in battering relationships.

      "bodyText": "Helena Kennedy QC I'd just become a senior counsel in 1991 when I was briefed on a case involving the killing of a baby for which a young man, Brian Hedman, and woman, Sally Emery, were standing trial. I had a strong feeling that there was much more to this case than we were getting at. I was representing Emery, who was very careful not to say anything incriminating about her husband. They both denied the charges. But as she began to trust me, she began to unravel that she had been battered. I wanted someone who had a psychiatric background to see her, but at that time battered women's syndrome was still a year away from being a recognised psychiatric diagnosis. I remembered an article about the dynamics of women survivors and how often the men who were abusers were not the stereotype of the aggressor and the woman wasn't necessarily timid or passive. The author was Sandra Horley, director of the then Chiswick Women's Aid. The trial had already started when I phoned her. I knew it would be difficult to persuade the court to acknowledge her as an expert - it's easier if you have someone medically or scientifically qualified - yet there was probably no one more experienced than someone who'd worked in refuges for 20 years. I arranged to see her in chambers after court that day, to see whether she would make a good witness. Sandra arrived wearing a red cape and looked glamorous, which is a plus, because if someone looks interesting and likeable that's half the battle. I was thrilled because she defied the idea of a feminist adviser to battered women, she obviously liked men, she was highly informed and could clearly describe the dynamics operating in battering relationships. I was trying to show that people like the chap in the dock, who in fact came across as a gentle soul and quite likeable, can also, behind closed doors, sometimes be violent. And a woman can sometimes be psychologically frozen and believe that the man who was once charming, who has turned into her persecutor, can be won back by her adjusting her behaviour. In the end, Hedman was given eight years in prison for cruelty, and Emery the lesser charge of failing to get medical attention. Sandra has been at the heart of the shift in the legal understanding of domestic violence and she has been the key person who's helped me do cases in the courtroom with the degree of understanding that I otherwise would never have had. She is able to empathise very well with the people she works with because she's had it tough, too.

Police rushing in to subdue the squall upbraided them: 'If you don't cut this out, you'll have to leave before she arrives.'</p> <p>An immediate, snarling peace was established as police restrained a mother determined to get her child a better view by dangling him precariously from the bridge, 30ft above the railway.</p> <p>Welcome to 'Platform 9 and 3/4'. As Potterites know, this is where their young hero boards the Hogswart Express at the start of each school term, heading for adventure armed with nothing but half-baked spells and an insipid group of friends that drive some critics to distraction.</p> <p>But what should have been the happiest day in a month of book-publishing Saturdays descended into farce yesterday as more than 300 children watched in dismay when the press formed a scrum and trampled both them and their bemused parents underfoot.</p> <p>'It's a shame,' said Linda Mullen, who had come with her 7-year-old son, Daniel. 'This should be an event for the kids, but it's full of people rushing around with their mobile phones. Where's the fantasy and magic in this?' 'I thought there would be flying owls,' whispered her son.</p> <p>The waiting is over and Harry Potter is back. The frenzied speculation of the past few weeks has woven its witchcraft: many of the initial 1.5 million prints have already been sold and every child in Britain and beyond with a taste for magic and three-headed dogs called Fluffy is agog with excitement to learn which of Harry's friends dies, which girl he has a crush on, and whether the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor lasts longer than the last.</p> <p>Rowling dismounted from the trademark light blue Ford Anglia of Harry's cruel uncle with engine oil on her calves, and set off instinctively towards the bank of keening children. But she was jostled instead towards the baying scribes and snappers.</p> <p>Thomas Martin, seven, proudly sporting his father's black velvet smoking jacket and a witch's hat half as tall as himself, was too excited to sleep the night before but now sat on his father's shoulders and stared glumly from the back of the crowd. 'I suppose she's just a normal person anyway, just like anyone else,' he sadly concluded.</p> <p>Rowling had the look of someone who had been outfoxed by her press office. Each time she tried to move towards her small fans, she was pulled back by the press pack, surrounded by flashing cameras and gesturing sadly towards her young readers with frustrated goodwill.</p> <p>'I'm sorry,' she called to a group of children who had left their home in Durham at 5.45 that morning to visit the Dome but had managed to persuade their parents to change course en route. 'I'm not allowed: the policeman told me.' The policemen surrounding her looked ashamed, and the one who had his book signed moments before tried to hide it behind his back. Ariadne, 10, was frantic. 'It's ruined,' she sobbed. 'The book won't seem nearly as magic now.' 'She'll get over it,' reasoned her mother, 'it's all been a bit too much. She knew she probably wouldn't get her book signed, but she did hope to get a smile.'</p> <p>Luke Gate, nine, avoided the madness and retreated behind the ticket office to read his new book in peace. 'She's just a normal person. Harry's my hero, not her,' he said gloomily.</p> <p>As the train chugged away, headed off to the next press call in Didcot, Rowling leaned out of the carriage and waved for all she was worth. 'Oh God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' she called unhappily. 'It was nice meeting you all.'</p> <p>'And you,' called one polite little voice from the front.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\"> amelia.hill@observer.co.uk </a></p>",

Police rushing in to subdue the squall upbraided them: 'If you don't cut this out, you'll have to leave before she arrives.' An immediate, snarling peace was established as police restrained a mother determined to get her child a better view by dangling him precariously from the bridge, 30ft above the railway. Welcome to 'Platform 9 and 3/4'. As Potterites know, this is where their young hero boards the Hogswart Express at the start of each school term, heading for adventure armed with nothing but half-baked spells and an insipid group of friends that drive some critics to distraction. But what should have been the happiest day in a month of book-publishing Saturdays descended into farce yesterday as more than 300 children watched in dismay when the press formed a scrum and trampled both them and their bemused parents underfoot. 'It's a shame,' said Linda Mullen, who had come with her 7-year-old son, Daniel. 'This should be an event for the kids, but it's full of people rushing around with their mobile phones. Where's the fantasy and magic in this?' 'I thought there would be flying owls,' whispered her son. The waiting is over and Harry Potter is back. The frenzied speculation of the past few weeks has woven its witchcraft: many of the initial 1.5 million prints have already been sold and every child in Britain and beyond with a taste for magic and three-headed dogs called Fluffy is agog with excitement to learn which of Harry's friends dies, which girl he has a crush on, and whether the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor lasts longer than the last. Rowling dismounted from the trademark light blue Ford Anglia of Harry's cruel uncle with engine oil on her calves, and set off instinctively towards the bank of keening children. But she was jostled instead towards the baying scribes and snappers. Thomas Martin, seven, proudly sporting his father's black velvet smoking jacket and a witch's hat half as tall as himself, was too excited to sleep the night before but now sat on his father's shoulders and stared glumly from the back of the crowd. 'I suppose she's just a normal person anyway, just like anyone else,' he sadly concluded. Rowling had the look of someone who had been outfoxed by her press office. Each time she tried to move towards her small fans, she was pulled back by the press pack, surrounded by flashing cameras and gesturing sadly towards her young readers with frustrated goodwill. 'I'm sorry,' she called to a group of children who had left their home in Durham at 5.45 that morning to visit the Dome but had managed to persuade their parents to change course en route. 'I'm not allowed: the policeman told me.' The policemen surrounding her looked ashamed, and the one who had his book signed moments before tried to hide it behind his back. Ariadne, 10, was frantic. 'It's ruined,' she sobbed. 'The book won't seem nearly as magic now.' 'She'll get over it,' reasoned her mother, 'it's all been a bit too much. She knew she probably wouldn't get her book signed, but she did hope to get a smile.' Luke Gate, nine, avoided the madness and retreated behind the ticket office to read his new book in peace. 'She's just a normal person. Harry's my hero, not her,' he said gloomily. As the train chugged away, headed off to the next press call in Didcot, Rowling leaned out of the carriage and waved for all she was worth. 'Oh God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' she called unhappily. 'It was nice meeting you all.' 'And you,' called one polite little voice from the front. amelia.hill@observer.co.uk",

'If someone said I had to eat the same thing every day for the rest of my life, I could survive on organic brown rice. If I were limited to one choice of drink, I would hate it. What would I choose? Perhaps Campari and soda.' Another time, he thought he'd prefer mint juleps.</p> <p>Even if your repertoire of summery drinks extends no further than gin and tonic, you can learn from Dick Bradsell. He may let slip an acid jest as sharp as a twist of lemon peel, but it is largely thanks to his influence that Britain now has a scattering of proper bars with well-made drinks.</p> <p>As a shy boy in an 'inbred weirdo' corner of the Isle of Wight, with a 'mad professor' father, Bradsell was bullied for being a bookworm. 'I liked Harper Lee_ don't say anything about Tequila Mockingbird.' Now, he favours Charles Bukowski. The change began when he became a punk rocker. 'There was a party at which our house got trashed. I was sent away and put in the care of my Wicked Uncle, a former naval man, in London. He ran the Naval &amp; Military Club in Piccadilly. He knew everybody: the police, the criminals, the ladies. The complete training he gave me would have been hard to find elsewhere. At the club they made pink gins. Where else could you still get pink gins in the mid-70s? I had to buckle down, learn to make Pimm's, martinis, gin and tonics_'</p> <p>The gin and tonic is still the acid test for Bradsell. 'I can tell you if a person will ever make a bartender by watching them make a gin-and-tonic over and over again. Some people could try for three months and still not make a decent one.'</p> <p>Not 'three cubes of ice' but a glassful. Not 'equal parts' but two shots of gin. Not 'a horrible, thin little piece of lemon' but a fresh, healthy slice; not inserted by 'digging about with a spoon, spilling half the drink', but popped in by hand. And always a fresh bottle of tonic.</p> <p>Another boss drew diagrams to illustrate the interplay of flavours in a mixed drink. Bradsell does the same for me on a napkin. 'Classic cocktails are the starting point for most new recipes. The flavours of the principal elements must be in balance. Between them are gaps in flavour. These gaps must be filled. We are trying to create one long flavour on the palate. I want my customers to enjoy it so much they order another.' The diagram now looks like a geological section, but it is actually a Brandy Alexander. 'The Cognac is here, the cream there, the dark cacao, and the white... '</p> <p>Such classics are more than a cover for the flavour of alcohol, but they were a visual disguise during Prohibition, and the notion of innocently pretty but potent drinks is surely the basis of their 'dangerous' glamour. They recall their heyday in grand hotels like New York's Waldorf and London's Savoy - where 'the line of knowledge' (to use one of Bradsell's favourite phrases) is continued today by Peter Dorelli.</p> <p>Names such as Dorelli, Gilberto Preti (at Duke's Hotel) and Salvatore Calabrese (the Lanesborough) are a reminder that the British are traditionally uncomfortable with jobs that involve service. Bradsell reckons his unexotic Englishness helped him be noticed. A more important distinction is that he has never worked in a hotel. The base of his influence is the contemporary bar. He has worked in the best, and his trainees are everywhere.</p> <p>In the late 70s, Bradsell worked at the Zanzibar, spending two years learning all the drinks on the list. This was the era of pi\u00f1a coladas, Blue Hawaiians, Scorpions. In some places the Scorpions did not bite, and the era of rip-off drinks has left Bradsell a campaigner for proper measures, good quality spirits and fresh juices, fruits and garnishes. 'I remember when there was no decent vodka or tequila, no fresh lemon or lime, no raspberries, no garden mint in any bar in London.'</p> <p>As the mood has swung between glamour and grunge, Bradsell has ridden on every cocktail revival. At the Soho Brasserie, he created the Vodka Espresso. At the Groucho, media types favoured Moscow Mules. In what he dubs the era of Ecstasy and flavoured vodkas (notably Mars bar), he joyfully dispensed classic cocktails at Fred's. At the Atlantic, Dick's bar was noted for Raspberry Martinis and Russian Spring Punches.</p> <p>People who once came to London to dance all weekend now come to tour cocktail bars instead. There is a bar culture. There are also new bar neighbourhoods. The latest seems set to be SoSho (South Shoreditch), where the new Match opens next Tuesday.

Not 'a horrible, thin little piece of lemon' but a fresh, healthy slice; not inserted by 'digging about with a spoon, spilling half the drink', but popped in by hand. And always a fresh bottle of tonic. Another boss drew diagrams to illustrate the interplay of flavours in a mixed drink. Bradsell does the same for me on a napkin. 'Classic cocktails are the starting point for most new recipes. The flavours of the principal elements must be in balance. Between them are gaps in flavour. These gaps must be filled. We are trying to create one long flavour on the palate. I want my customers to enjoy it so much they order another.' The diagram now looks like a geological section, but it is actually a Brandy Alexander. 'The Cognac is here, the cream there, the dark cacao, and the white... ' Such classics are more than a cover for the flavour of alcohol, but they were a visual disguise during Prohibition, and the notion of innocently pretty but potent drinks is surely the basis of their 'dangerous' glamour. They recall their heyday in grand hotels like New York's Waldorf and London's Savoy - where 'the line of knowledge' (to use one of Bradsell's favourite phrases) is continued today by Peter Dorelli. Names such as Dorelli, Gilberto Preti (at Duke's Hotel) and Salvatore Calabrese (the Lanesborough) are a reminder that the British are traditionally uncomfortable with jobs that involve service. Bradsell reckons his unexotic Englishness helped him be noticed. A more important distinction is that he has never worked in a hotel. The base of his influence is the contemporary bar. He has worked in the best, and his trainees are everywhere. In the late 70s, Bradsell worked at the Zanzibar, spending two years learning all the drinks on the list. This was the era of pi\u00f1a coladas, Blue Hawaiians, Scorpions. In some places the Scorpions did not bite, and the era of rip-off drinks has left Bradsell a campaigner for proper measures, good quality spirits and fresh juices, fruits and garnishes. 'I remember when there was no decent vodka or tequila, no fresh lemon or lime, no raspberries, no garden mint in any bar in London.' As the mood has swung between glamour and grunge, Bradsell has ridden on every cocktail revival. At the Soho Brasserie, he created the Vodka Espresso. At the Groucho, media types favoured Moscow Mules. In what he dubs the era of Ecstasy and flavoured vodkas (notably Mars bar), he joyfully dispensed classic cocktails at Fred's. At the Atlantic, Dick's bar was noted for Raspberry Martinis and Russian Spring Punches. People who once came to London to dance all weekend now come to tour cocktail bars instead. There is a bar culture. There are also new bar neighbourhoods. The latest seems set to be SoSho (South Shoreditch), where the new Match opens next Tuesday. The drinks are by Dick Bradsell... as are these two recipes. The Observer Summer Cocktail 30ml Stoli Razbri 25ml cranberry juice 10ml Cointreau 10ml framboise liqueur dash of lime cordial juice of lime wedge dash of orange bitters lemon twist, to garnish Shake all ingredients (except lemon twist) with ice.

But, without the same anatomical make-up, how could he possibly understand the vagaries of pregnancy, agonies of childbirth and mysteries of breast-feeding? Admittedly, I might have ended up with a male doctor supervising events in the delivery suite. But I had opted for a community midwifery team - to provide antenatal care, deliver my baby in hospital and look after me afterwards at home- precisely because I wanted to keep doctors - and, yes, men - out of my delivery as much as possible. What I wanted was the empathetic, low-key approach I suspected only another woman could provide.</p> <p>Worried I might be oversensitive, I asked friends how they would react. Responses ranged from mild discomfort to downright outrage that - once again - men were muscling in on childbirth. But rejecting John would mean being delivered by a hospital midwife I had never even met. I decided to take a gamble: as he was one of six midwives on the team, I had a one in six chance - a kind of childbirth Russian roulette - of avoiding him.</p> <p>In the event, John was not on duty when my daughter was born three years ago - but, by then, I wished he had been. Two days earlier, I had gone into hospital with what turned out to be 'false labour' - trial contractions before the real thing - and spent a lonely and painful night on the labour ward with barely a perfunctory check from a midwife. In the morning, when John appeared at the foot of my bed to check how I was, reassure me all was well and say I could go home, I was so relieved to see a friendly and familiar face I could have hugged him. It struck me then that knowing and trusting a midwife might be more important than their gender, and I genuinely regretted he had not been on hand when Susannah was born.</p> <p>Most pregnant women never face the same dilemma, since male midwives are still very much in a minority. Only 94 out of more than 33,000 midwives currently practising in the UK are male. Men first entered the profession in 1983, after a long legal battle and in the face of fierce opposition from female midwives and women generally. Seventeen years later, they have confounded their critics. Male midwives have not only been accepted by the vast majority of pregnant women but - in some cases - are now being positively preferred and actively recommended by women to their friends.</p> <p>John - Willie John Dolan - is a typical example. After only four years as a midwife (he qualified in 1996), he has a firm following in the Shepherd's Bush area of London, where he works. Renowned for his non-interventionist, natural approach to childbirth, he is heavily in demand. Women who have had first babies delivered by him request him for the next time and pass his name on to their pregnant friends. 'His reputation goes before him,' says student midwife Joan Foy, who specifically asked to train alongside him.</p> <p>Dolan, 31, knew he wanted to become a midwife when he was 16. He was inspired by his midwife aunt. But being brought up on a farm in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, it was not the simplest career choice. He moved to London to train as a nurse, spent six years on the wards, then began the 18-month course to become a midwife. 'Midwifery was always what I wanted to do,' he says.</p> <p>Although based at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, west London, he works on a community one-to-one scheme - one of only two in the UK - which aims to allow women to be cared for by the same midwife throughout pregnancy. The midwives work in pairs - covering for each other when off duty - yet Dolan still delivers around 90 per cent of the women on his caseload by being available on days off. He boasts one of the highest home-birth rates in the area - 11 out of 30 deliveries since November, while the national rate is 2 per cent - and strives to keep Caesarean sections and other medical interventions to a minimum.</p> <p>'Women are very vulnerable in labour,' Dolan says. 'It is the most painful time in one's life and you need someone you can trust. The idea is to have a positive attitude and keep things as positive as possible.'</p> <p>Initially, he was rejected by women who felt uncomfortable with the idea of a man delivering their baby, some on religious grounds. Dolan still allows his patients up to 20 weeks to opt out. But since his reputation has grown, few do. After seven months, when he sees patients every two weeks, a strong relationship has usually built up, he says. 'The woman gets to trust you, and you get to know what she wants.'</p> <p>Lucy Boyd's third baby, Mia, was delivered at home by Dolan just two weeks ago with her family - her mother Rose Gray owns The River Cafe - downstairs. Boyd, 34, herself a cook, chose Dolan after he delivered her second daughter, Alex, now 14 months. She had no qualms about a male midwife. 'The main thing is that you are able to trust the person looking after you,' she says. Her labour was so quick that when Dolan arrived at her house on his Friday night off, she did not want to leave for hospital. 'Willie John was absolutely fantastic,' she says. 'He made me feel secure and reassured that everything was fine.'</p> <p>Melanie Yudolph, 36, whose second baby is due imminently, requested Dolan as her midwife on the recommendation of a friend. She had her first child by elective Caesarean because she was so afraid of a natural delivery, but this time hopes for a natural birth despite her fears. She has no apprehensions about Dolan: 'I just know he knows more about it than I do.'</p> <p>Her friend Louise Hart recommended Dolan after he delivered her second baby, Remy, last October. The birth of her first child, Ethan, now nearly six, had been so traumatic she waited five years before getting pregnant again. This time, although labour took 15 hours, the birth was 'absolutely brilliant', says Hart, 37, who works for a record company.</p> <p>Dolan supported Louise's wish to avoid a Caesarean and kept epidural doses to a minimum. 'The great thing for me was he really stood up to these male and female doctors. He was not bolshie or aggressive, he just stood his ground.'</p> <p>Being male is irrelevant to his approach, Dolan believes. Anyone going into midwifery needs a particular personality, he argues, whether they are male or female. 'Childbirth is one of the most natural things women do, and you need to support that. You are the woman's advocate,' he says. He is certainly not motivated by money, since top pay for clinical midwives runs to \u00a324,000. 'Job satisfaction is more important than pay for me,' he says.</p> <p>Money was a major obstacle for James Tudge when he gave up his job as a lorry driver 11 years ago to become a midwife. He was inspired by the birth of his own son, Daniel. 'It was just seeing my son born. It was very emotional,' he recalls. But embarking on nurse training followed by a midwifery course meant bringing home in a month the same pay he earned driving lorries in a week. Still, having now worked for four years at Bolton General Hospital, where his son was born, he has no regrets. Although some women do reject him, he encounters few problems. 'I have been told I am always very compassionate with women and usually spend more time with them than female midwives do,' says Tudge, 40.</p> <p>Unlike in nursing, where men generally scale the management ladder faster than women, most male midwives have stayed in clinical practice. One exception is Paul Lewis, one of the first men ever to become a midwife and now professor of midwifery at Bournemouth University. As a nurse, he enrolled on the first experimental midwifery training scheme for men in 1979 at the Whittington Hospital, London, largely because he wanted obstetrics experience to work abroad. Once qualified, he was unable to practice until 1983, when the Government lifted the legal barriers, and then took his first job at King's College Hospital, London.</p> <p>He, too, believes a midwife's gender is unimportant. 'If they are good midwives they are good midwives whether they are men or not,' he says. But as a minority group, he believes men who become midwives often try harder not to take over or cause offence.</p> <p>They appear to have been so successful that they have not only won over many pregnant women but also transformed erstwhile enemies into firm friends. Independent midwife Caroline Flint was totally opposed to men in midwifery when the idea was first mooted in the 70s. 'We'd had such problems with male obstetricians taking over that I had suspicions male midwives would be the same,' she says. 'But they are not, they are not at all.' She describes Lewis as 'visionary' while all male midwives she has met have been 'lovely, gentle' men.</p> <p>Beverly Beech, who chairs the lobby group the Association for Improvements in Maternity Services (AIMS), was another vehement opponent. Now she says: 'I have yet to meet a male midwife who has not been absolutely super.'</p> <p>Misgivings remain. Some pregnant women are still diffident when they encounter male midwives, according to the president of the National Childbirth Trust, Gillian Fletcher, who teaches antenatal classes in an area where a male midwife practises. Some remain totally opposed to the idea, while others decide that gender is unimportant, she says. Women should always be able to opt out if they are uncomfortable with a midwife, she stresses. But she adds: 'At the end of the day, it is not so much about what gender they are but how they treat people.'</p> <p><b> Men and maternity</b></p> <p>Delivering babies was an exclusively female experience - men were taboo in the birthing room - until the first 'man-midwives' emerged in the 16th century.

His volleying, and serving for that matter, is just fantastic. For serving, though, I'd pick a left-hander like Ivanisevich. Technically, his action is just about perfect, he's the best. He's tall, with good reach - height makes a lot of difference. He's also got that left-handed angle, which is very unusual - a left-hand serve gives you extra difficulty because it's not something you're used to. For forehand, I'd probably have to say Andre Agassi, maybe even Agassi for backhand as well... although Becker and Sampras have great backhands, too. But Agassi just has fantastic ground strokes, the best of all time. He's got a great eye, hits the ball very hard and he's quick on his feet.</p> <p>Conners and McEnroe have the best mental attitude - they're tough, really tough, good fighters. They are both relentless competitors, who make it very, very hard for you. I definitely think there was an element to McEnroe's behaviour that was about deliberately unsettling his opponent. I don't know that for sure, but I'd say it was borderline cheating, and he did go too far sometimes. I'm good friends with John nowadays - we both do commentary for the BBC.</p> <p>For pure speed, I'd go for Michael Chang. I think he's probably the quickest player there ever was. But you need a combination of speed, agility and height. The most powerful player is probably Mark Philippoussis - but again, power's not much if you don't have something else with it. For overall athleticism, Yannick Noah is fantastic, and then there's Bjorn Borg, who had such endurance - he's just so fast.</p> <p>I think Wimbledon was very open this year. But if I'd had to put my money on someone, it would have been Sampras.</p>",

His volleying, and serving for that matter, is just fantastic. For serving, though, I'd pick a left-hander like Ivanisevich. Technically, his action is just about perfect, he's the best. He's tall, with good reach - height makes a lot of difference. He's also got that left-handed angle, which is very unusual - a left-hand serve gives you extra difficulty because it's not something you're used to. For forehand, I'd probably have to say Andre Agassi, maybe even Agassi for backhand as well... although Becker and Sampras have great backhands, too. But Agassi just has fantastic ground strokes, the best of all time. He's got a great eye, hits the ball very hard and he's quick on his feet. Conners and McEnroe have the best mental attitude - they're tough, really tough, good fighters. They are both relentless competitors, who make it very, very hard for you. I definitely think there was an element to McEnroe's behaviour that was about deliberately unsettling his opponent. I don't know that for sure, but I'd say it was borderline cheating, and he did go too far sometimes. I'm good friends with John nowadays - we both do commentary for the BBC. For pure speed, I'd go for Michael Chang. I think he's probably the quickest player there ever was. But you need a combination of speed, agility and height. The most powerful player is probably Mark Philippoussis - but again, power's not much if you don't have something else with it. For overall athleticism, Yannick Noah is fantastic, and then there's Bjorn Borg, who had such endurance - he's just so fast. I think Wimbledon was very open this year. But if I'd had to put my money on someone, it would have been Sampras.",

Rowling gives two snitches for that: she will be laughing all the way to the bank.</p> <p><b>Mini muggles say: It's wicked</b><br> The young fans' verdict:<br></p> <p><b>Anna Berrill, 13 </b><br> The thing about Harry Potter's magical world is that the minute you start to read, you can imagine yourself being there. They're just like real life, but with wizardy bits added on. Harry's first three adventures have been so exciting that I couldn't imagine how The Goblet of Fire could match up to them. It starts off in a village called Little Hangleton and I couldn't see how it followed on from the previous stories. But suddenly there is Voldemort up to his old tricks with the dark arts. From then on you're back with all those characters you really like reading about because you care what happens to them.</p> <p>The summer holidays are dragging on a bit for Harry in the ordinary old muggle world until his best friend Ron Weasley invites him to the Quidditch world cup. Quidditch is one of the best things about the Harry books. It's a game I'd really like to have a go at - I wish we played it at my school, because it sounds a lot more fun than muggle hockey.</p> <p>I've got two favourite characters, Fred and George. They are very funny and get into some good scrapes. They remind me a lot of my friends, not that my friends are wizards - at least, I don't think they are.</p> <p><b> Sam Sweeney, 11</b><br> I feel privileged to be one of the first to dive into this wicked adventure! Millions and millions of kids are desperate to get their hands it. I think this novel is very descriptive and really tense and spooky. This book is very chunky for young readers. It costs \u00a314.99 so you Harry Potter fans better start saving. If you were spooked by the last three books, this one is meant to be more scary. J.K. Rowling has a brill way of luring you into the story. If you have read the others, don't worry; you don't get bored when she's explaining about Harry's life so far. The good descriptions can turn a flat character three-dimensional. She writes about Harry watching his mean uncle's face: 'He watched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon's face, making it look like badly mixed blackcurrant ice-cream.' And so far, the plot is superb.</p> <p><b>Sian Pearson, 11 </b><br> The most surprising thing about the new Harry Potter is how BIG it is - with 636 pages it is the longest book I have read. The size of it didn't put me off reading it though. After the first couple of pages the magical world of Harry, Hermione, Ron and friends comes zooming back to you as you remember all the adventures they have had in the previous books. Harry meets many exciting and strange characters and Fred and George Weasley are, as usual, getting up to all sorts of mischief. The amazing, funny and sometimes scary plot keeps you hooked and your fingers will itch to keep turning the pages. This book is just as brilliant and gripping as the other Harry Potter books and I am still unable to choose a favourite. I hope J.K. Rowling will carry on writing, and I know I will read every one of them.</p>",

Rowling herself cracks some good jokes (I particularly liked the reference to that essential volume Men Who Love Dragons Too Much ) but there's precious little humour in Harry himself. Not, I suspect, that J.K. Rowling gives two snitches for that: she will be laughing all the way to the bank. Mini muggles say: It's wicked The young fans' verdict: Anna Berrill, 13 The thing about Harry Potter's magical world is that the minute you start to read, you can imagine yourself being there. They're just like real life, but with wizardy bits added on. Harry's first three adventures have been so exciting that I couldn't imagine how The Goblet of Fire could match up to them. It starts off in a village called Little Hangleton and I couldn't see how it followed on from the previous stories. But suddenly there is Voldemort up to his old tricks with the dark arts. From then on you're back with all those characters you really like reading about because you care what happens to them. The summer holidays are dragging on a bit for Harry in the ordinary old muggle world until his best friend Ron Weasley invites him to the Quidditch world cup. Quidditch is one of the best things about the Harry books. It's a game I'd really like to have a go at - I wish we played it at my school, because it sounds a lot more fun than muggle hockey. I've got two favourite characters, Fred and George. They are very funny and get into some good scrapes. They remind me a lot of my friends, not that my friends are wizards - at least, I don't think they are. Sam Sweeney, 11 I feel privileged to be one of the first to dive into this wicked adventure! Millions and millions of kids are desperate to get their hands it. I think this novel is very descriptive and really tense and spooky. This book is very chunky for young readers. It costs \u00a314.99 so you Harry Potter fans better start saving. If you were spooked by the last three books, this one is meant to be more scary. J.K. Rowling has a brill way of luring you into the story. If you have read the others, don't worry; you don't get bored when she's explaining about Harry's life so far. The good descriptions can turn a flat character three-dimensional. She writes about Harry watching his mean uncle's face: 'He watched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon's face, making it look like badly mixed blackcurrant ice-cream.' And so far, the plot is superb. Sian Pearson, 11 The most surprising thing about the new Harry Potter is how BIG it is - with 636 pages it is the longest book I have read. The size of it didn't put me off reading it though. After the first couple of pages the magical world of Harry, Hermione, Ron and friends comes zooming back to you as you remember all the adventures they have had in the previous books. Harry meets many exciting and strange characters and Fred and George Weasley are, as usual, getting up to all sorts of mischief. The amazing, funny and sometimes scary plot keeps you hooked and your fingers will itch to keep turning the pages. This book is just as brilliant and gripping as the other Harry Potter books and I am still unable to choose a favourite. I hope J.K. Rowling will carry on writing, and I know I will read every one of them.",

Ruins do not encourage the viewer to dwell on what they were like in their heyday. The Colosseum in Rome or the amphitheatre at Leptis Magna have never been anything but ruins. They are eternal ruins. And it's the same here. This building could never have looked more magnificent than it did now. Rather than make you think of the past, ruins direct you towards the future. The effect is almost prophetic. This is what the future will end up like. This is what the future has always ended up looking like.</p> <p>The station was framed and - because of the broken windows - penetrated by the sky: a specific Midwestern sky, a prairie sky, a sky at ease with hugeness.

In almost every crack in the concrete there was a sprouting of grey-green grass: the prairie making a slow comeback. Eventually, perhaps, the entire city will return to the prairie.</p> <p>I asked the photographers if they knew the work of Camilo Jos\u00e9 Vergara. No, they did not. This surprised me. I'd assumed they were on the Vergara trail. Like me. He was the reason - one of two reasons - I was here in Detroit.</p> <p>Vergara has spent years photographing the ruins of American cities.

Buildings like the Book-Cadillac Hotel and the Statler Hilton took on the landmark importance of the Empire State or the Statue of Liberty for a first-time visitor to New York. In one particular spot in downtown Detroit, you can see half a dozen architecturally outstanding buildings in various stages of dilapidation: Kales, United Artists, Fine Arts, Park Avenue, the Statler Hilton, the Wurlitzer, the David Broderick Tower_</p> <p>Monday-Friday the area is sparsely populated. On a typical weekend, you could be the last person on the planet. The best views, though, are from the People Mover, a driver-less elevated train that takes a 15-minute loop through the heart of downtown. One moment you're gliding past immaculate, new, sky-reflecting office blocks, the next you're passing within a few feet of the Ionic columns and weather-squatted interior of the abandoned Statler Hilton. It's like Belgrade and Manhattan rolled into one.</p> <p>Vergara would like to preserve parts of the ruined downtown 'as an American Acropolis - that is, to allow the present skyscraper graveyard to become a park of ripe ruins'. As he himself concedes, however, this plan is 'seen by most as at best misguided and at worst a cruel joke'. This lends an urgency to the task of preserving them on film. Several of the places photographed by Vergara have already been demolished, making way for new projects more appropriate to the city's future-oriented mood.</p> <p>Tyree Guyton's 'guerrilla' art - which radically transformed buildings in Heidelberg Street in the 90s, embellishing them with baroque flourishes and surreal accretions of discarded junk - has been stamped out by the city. Less alarming than demolition per se is the swiftness of the amnesia that settles in its wake. It is as if people's memories are housed in the buildings that surround them. Demolish the building and you destroy the memory of its ever having existed.</p> <p>Following Vergara's visual itinerary, I visited Brush Park, an area of derelict Victorian mansions which, in the late-19th century, was the wealthiest part of the city. A few days later I passed by again, in a taxi, on the way to the DIA. In response to a question, the driver indicated 'the ghetto' off to the right.</p> <p>'Brush Park,' I said. He didn't know what I was talking about. He'd never heard it called that. To him it was just the ghetto. Whatever it was called, I had been there. I would like to have walked but, unsure about how safe it was, I visited American-style, in the car, with the doors locked and the windows sealed.</p> <p>It's located off Woodward Avenue, a few blocks north of the new Tigers stadium. Houses and the burnt-out, plundered remains of houses are so thin on the ground that the area has an airy, rural quality.

A few vagrants stood around fires. Smoke drifted. An old man sat in a doorway reading the paper with the concentration of a scholar deciphering hieroglyphics. It was a peaceful scene.</p> <p>Feeling conspicuous as an investment banker, I locked my car and walked over to the corner store - George's Market - which, incredibly, was still functioning. Half an hour earlier I had stopped off at the old Ford plant at Highland Park, home of the Model T. By 1925, a plaque explained, 9,000 Model Ts were being made in a single day, 'setting the pattern of abundance for 20th-century living'. Now, in the 21st century, I was sitting on the curb in the Brush Park ghetto, strawing Coke from a bottle, feeling quite content.</p> <p>People came by, pushing shopping trolleys as if the world were an enormously depleted supermarket in which there was nothing left to buy. I looked at the guy straining hard over his newspaper, at another toasting his hands over a fire (it wasn't a cold day but, after a certain point of dereliction, you never miss a chance to get warm) and thought that I wouldn't at all mind ending up like either of them.</p> <p>Buildings do not just fall into ruin; something in them aspires to ruination. It's the same with people. All we can do is keep applying the creosote, propping ourselves up with health and success, trying to keep the rot at bay for a little longer, trying to postpone the moment of complete collapse and abandonment for the same reason that one waits as long as possible for the first alcoholic drink of the day: because the longer you leave it, the better it will feel.</p> <p>In the vacant aftermath of this thought, a young mother came by with her two kids, lovely in their freshly laundered clothes, and I was struck by the power of an equal and opposite urge: to improve, to make your life better, to pick yourself up off the floor, to get on your feet. We smiled, said 'Hi' and I stood up.</p> <p>There were a number of places photographed by Vergara that I couldn't find. One of them was the Packard Automobile Plant where, he writes, 'illegal parties known as \"raves\" are held... Techno, which originated in Detroit, is the music of choice.'</p> <p>That's the second reason I was here.</p> <p>Not only did techno originate in Detroit, it's also been the city's most important musical export since Motown. The innovators - Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May and Juan Atkins - are all from the area, and the city's industrial past and desolate present audibly animate their music. In 1988 Atkins explained that 'Berry Gordy built the Motown sound on the same principles as the conveyor belt system at Ford's. Today their plants don't work that way - they use robots and computers to make the cars. I'm probably more interested in Ford's robots than Berry Gordy's music.' If people are put off by exactly this inhuman, robotic quality, for Atkins the fact that Detroit was 'such a desolate place' meant that he saw techno as an alternative reality, 'like as dreaming'. I liked the aboriginal suggestion of that phrase, its hint that the music somehow accessed the urban songlines of the place, the hidden geography of the city.</p> <p>Detroit may have provided the soundtrack but it was only when the music was exported that it became part of the larger social phenomenon of dance culture. This year, though, it was decided to bring it all back home in the form of the free three-day Detroit Electronic Music Festival.</p> <p>It was quite a gamble. For a start, dance music has become indelibly associated with drugs and Detroit is a city that has suffered from drugs every bit as much as London has benefited from them. And the venue for this festival was not some abandoned industrial wasteland but the riverside Hart Plaza, overlooked by plush expense-account hotels and spanking new corporate developments, such as the Renaissance Center (headquarters of General Motors, 74 storeys high, topped off with a revolving restaurant).</p> <p>Part of the reason for using this civic amenity was to attract Detroiters who had either never been exposed to their local brand of post-industrial folk music or who'd been put off by the druggy warehouse scene. But would they come?</p> <p>They did. By close of the first day's play, 300,000 people had turned up. According to the festival's creative director Carl Craig, 750,000 were there for the festival's climax on Memorial Day, among them the mother and her two kids I had seen amid the ruins of Brush Park a few days earlier. In other ways, too, the success of the festival extended way beyond the epic schedule of 36 hours of music and dance. Something else was happening here, too. Seventy per cent of the artists performing - including May and Saunderson - were from the Detroit area. It was a site-specific triumph and, as the festival developed, people began to get a palpable sense that they were not simply witnessing but were part of a turning point in the history of their city.</p> <p>Techno - which was pioneered by black men - emerged from the ruins of a city nearly destroyed by racial tension. In some respects the city after the riots was like a miniature urban version of a post-colonial nation in Africa. An affluent white city turned into a poor black one almost overnight; the whites left, the blacks had to sort things out.</p> <p>In Devil's Night , Chafets quotes a police spokesman as saying that 'Detroit was the first city to get a lot of these problems, and it's going to be the first city to find solutions to them.' The festival celebrated one aspect of this ongoing search. No one would claim that a three-day feast of electronic music was going to solve all the city's problems, but, equally, no one who was there could deny the capacity of music and dance to bring people together. That has become a commercially exploitable clich\u00e9 in London and elsewhere, but here it was felt as a self-evident truth. After the final set by localish hero Richie Hawtin, Carl Craig made a brief speech that was intermittently drowned out by the crowd chanting 'Detroit! Detroit!' Substitute 'San Francisco' and it sounds - how shall I put it? - implausible , but this, remember, is a city that has been on its knees for almost a third of a century. Now it was getting back on its feet. Also, crucially, the festival had been organised with the co-operation of the city council. The DEMF cannot bring about economic resurrection, but it heralds a possible future of regeneration and liberation.</p> <p>This was made explicit on Saturday night when Stacey Pullen sampled Martin Luther King's 'I have a dream' speech, culminating with the famous declaration 'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty we are free at last.' We associate this address - which has since been rapaciously sampled by DJs - with the march on Washington in 1963, but King actually delivered a version of the speech in Detroit two months earlier. With this historic resonance in mind, it would be difficult to exaggerate its relevance to - or the rapture with which it was received in - Detroit this time around.</p> <p>King's speech was the climactic moment of the 1963 March on Washington; DEMF, the new context for King's oratory, takes its cue from an event like Love Parade in Berlin which, in the words of German writer Ulf Poschardt, 'drops the demanding, critical character of the demonstration and simply demonstrates itself. What you see is what we want.' Like Love Parade, the DEMF 'doesn't promise anything - unusual in political discourse - but it demonstrates, in the true sense of the word: it presents, it shows.' It shows an alternative to the vision of ruination depicted by Church and Vergara. It shows a way out, a way up, a way ahead.</p>",

We associate this address - which has since been rapaciously sampled by DJs - with the march on Washington in 1963, but King actually delivered a version of the speech in Detroit two months earlier. With this historic resonance in mind, it would be difficult to exaggerate its relevance to - or the rapture with which it was received in - Detroit this time around. King's speech was the climactic moment of the 1963 March on Washington; DEMF, the new context for King's oratory, takes its cue from an event like Love Parade in Berlin which, in the words of German writer Ulf Poschardt, 'drops the demanding, critical character of the demonstration and simply demonstrates itself. What you see is what we want.' Like Love Parade, the DEMF 'doesn't promise anything - unusual in political discourse - but it demonstrates, in the true sense of the word: it presents, it shows.' It shows an alternative to the vision of ruination depicted by Church and Vergara. It shows a way out, a way up, a way ahead.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If holiday hotspot Ibiza is one big soap opera - and TV docu-soaps like Ibiza Uncovered suggest it is - then its notorious Manumission club is the leading lady. Since 1993 the club has pulled in 8,000 clubbers a week to Privilege, the island's biggest venue, with a saucy mix of gay imagery, club theatre, party games and, since 1996, a live sex show performed at dawn by the swimming pool in the middle of the club. Two couples are in charge, brothers Andy (balding, sensible) and Mike (shaved-head, bearded, wild) and their respective girlfriends Dawn and Claire, and all use Manumission as a surname. Their success has meant that keeping up with the Manumissions is a game every club on the island is forced to play. Andy and Dawn do the boring stuff; Mike and Claire the shagging - although sometimes Mike did generously allow another woman (or two) with a strap-on dildo to take over.</p> <p>Clubbers often found themselves performing party tricks - sitting on a toilet on the dancefloor reading a paper, maybe. Visitors lucky, or unlucky, enough to get into Mike and Claire's party hangout - a former brothel renamed the Manumission Motel - could find themselves sucked in and spat out weeks later. The DJ Derek Dahlarge came for a weekend and stayed all summer. Music journalists sent to cover Manumission ended up running around in costume - a knight in shining armour, say, or an abbot. Radio 1 bravely staged a fraught live broadcast from the club and famously lost DJ Lisa I'Anson into the chaos. She failed to turn up for her show the next morning and was publicly disciplined.</p> <p>As the rest of clubland has slowly embraced a kind of reluctant respectability - sponsorship deals, dress codes, 'brand identities' - Manumission alone seemed untouchable. 'Some of the things we did made us virtually unsponsorable,' says Andy. 'That was cool.' But that was then.</p> <p>The people who run clubland are getting older and the age gap between DJs and teenage clubbers gets bigger every year (two of Radio 1's 'dance team', DJs Pete Tong and Danny Rampling, are pushing 40). The talk at dance-industry get-togethers this year is more about mortgages and children than sex and drugs. For Ibiza's wildest, respectability is knocking on the door in the shape of the Orange mobile-phone network. Even the sex show has gone, replaced by an energetic display by performers from the De La Guarda aerobatic dance spectacular.</p> <p>Alongside the Motel and beachside boozer Bar M, Manumission has opened a fancy dress shop. (Hiring a club-supplied Lawrence of Arabia outfit does seem to miss the point - institutionalised raving for the kind of people who say, 'I'm mad, me.')</p> <p>On the day before the club opens its summer 2000 season, the Manumissions sit around a table on the sundeck of their new Pulp Fiction -style diner, in the portside of Ibiza's old town, making polite chitchat with the Men From Orange. This is a press launch to announce the sponsorship deal. The notorious sex show is in the past - it finished last year, having run its natural course, everyone says.

      "bodyText": "If holiday hotspot Ibiza is one big soap opera - and TV docu-soaps like Ibiza Uncovered suggest it is - then its notorious Manumission club is the leading lady. Since 1993 the club has pulled in 8,000 clubbers a week to Privilege, the island's biggest venue, with a saucy mix of gay imagery, club theatre, party games and, since 1996, a live sex show performed at dawn by the swimming pool in the middle of the club. Two couples are in charge, brothers Andy (balding, sensible) and Mike (shaved-head, bearded, wild) and their respective girlfriends Dawn and Claire, and all use Manumission as a surname. Their success has meant that keeping up with the Manumissions is a game every club on the island is forced to play. Andy and Dawn do the boring stuff; Mike and Claire the shagging - although sometimes Mike did generously allow another woman (or two) with a strap-on dildo to take over. Clubbers often found themselves performing party tricks - sitting on a toilet on the dancefloor reading a paper, maybe. Visitors lucky, or unlucky, enough to get into Mike and Claire's party hangout - a former brothel renamed the Manumission Motel - could find themselves sucked in and spat out weeks later. The DJ Derek Dahlarge came for a weekend and stayed all summer. Music journalists sent to cover Manumission ended up running around in costume - a knight in shining armour, say, or an abbot. Radio 1 bravely staged a fraught live broadcast from the club and famously lost DJ Lisa I'Anson into the chaos. She failed to turn up for her show the next morning and was publicly disciplined. As the rest of clubland has slowly embraced a kind of reluctant respectability - sponsorship deals, dress codes, 'brand identities' - Manumission alone seemed untouchable. 'Some of the things we did made us virtually unsponsorable,' says Andy. 'That was cool.' But that was then. The people who run clubland are getting older and the age gap between DJs and teenage clubbers gets bigger every year (two of Radio 1's 'dance team', DJs Pete Tong and Danny Rampling, are pushing 40). The talk at dance-industry get-togethers this year is more about mortgages and children than sex and drugs. For Ibiza's wildest, respectability is knocking on the door in the shape of the Orange mobile-phone network. Even the sex show has gone, replaced by an energetic display by performers from the De La Guarda aerobatic dance spectacular. Alongside the Motel and beachside boozer Bar M, Manumission has opened a fancy dress shop. (Hiring a club-supplied Lawrence of Arabia outfit does seem to miss the point - institutionalised raving for the kind of people who say, 'I'm mad, me.') On the day before the club opens its summer 2000 season, the Manumissions sit around a table on the sundeck of their new Pulp Fiction -style diner, in the portside of Ibiza's old town, making polite chitchat with the Men From Orange. This is a press launch to announce the sponsorship deal. The notorious sex show is in the past - it finished last year, having run its natural course, everyone says. Handily, Claire is eight months pregnant, which gives them a good excuse (and no, they say, baby Stan was not conceived on stage). 'They were doing it for hype,' says a pragmatic Man From Orange of the sex show later. 'They don't need to do it any more.' There are two Men From Orange on the Manumission table, gung ho and yet clearly worried about the marathon night planned for them: the club's 8am finish, followed by an after-party at another club, Space, that goes on well into the next day. 'Sleep deprivation is really good fun,' Mike Manumission tells them. They look worried.

      "body": "<p>When I was little, we used to go and stay with my great-auntie May and her husband Tom and I was struck by how much they enjoyed food. Breakfast toast was cooked on the fire in winter, and there would always be napkins, but not in a pretentious way. My mother was a good cook, too, but Auntie May gave me my burning desire to make food an enjoyable and loving thing. We always ate together as a family, and even if there's just the two of you, it's good to take even 10 minutes to eat together, rather than grabbing something from the fridge and eating it in front of the TV.</p> <p>One of the very first things I remember making was cheesecake at primary school - the gelatine went all into strands. But I was always in the kitchen with Mum, and I'd just cook instinctively, make things up. Even then I cared about food - laying a tray, not just plonking fruit and cheese on a board but adding grapes and walnuts - because that's what Auntie May used to do. The way food looks is very important - when I first went into private practice, I used to keep recipe books in my rooms to stimulate patients. I still don't really use them myself, although I love Claudia Roden - it's all so simple and her love of food shines through in her writing.</p> <p>As a teenager, I was interested in studying medicine, but I wanted to use food instead of drugs. My dad was a chemistry teacher and arranged for me to spend the day with a friend who was a dietician, an experience that encouraged me to do a dietetics degree at Leeds University. Unfortunately I hated it. It didn't live up to my expectations of using food in a passionate, healing and enjoyable way.</p> <p>Immediately afterwards, before going into practice as a dietician, I did a Cordon Bleu course to try and get some of the passion back. Being with people who wanted to cook with chocolate, or spending hours making filo pastry or Chelsea buns, just like Auntie May, was lovely. Now if I'm feeling really stressed, shopping for food and cooking is what really lifts me. A perfect day would start with going down to Borough Market, by the Thames, where there are lots of small specialist producers, seeing what I fancy and then spending the rest of the day cooking and having friends round.</p> <p>Making a risotto and having a glass of wine while you do it is heaven. I love the Spanish and Moroccan style of eating, too, with lots of little dishes - say, roasted onions with a rich tomato sauce, asparagus and a few olives - because I'm never satisfied with one taste. I also love picnics and last summer did a very big one for about 12 friends. We had poussin with preserved lemons and rosemary, and a sea bass in rock salt each, with loads of leafy salads and berries. Unfortunately, I couldn't have the strawberries, as my family is atopic, which means they have heightened sensitivity to certain allergens - some of them get eczema and hay fever, for example - but my particular allergy only emerged about 18 months ago.</p> <p>It was a bit of a joke at first. I'd slept badly, had a bit of a headache, and when I got up and looked in the mirror my face was all swollen - I looked as if I'd put a stone on overnight, but it went down with some anti-histamine and steroids. Over the next six months, I had about six or seven of these episodes, and eventually I identified that they were caused by tuna, salmon, strawberries and melon. Then I went to my Nana's funeral in Stoke-on-Trent and had a mouthful of salad that had salmon or tuna in it at lunch and went into full anaphylactic shock - my face and tongue swelled up and my blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate dropped. I was very lucky - my brother knew where the nearest hospital was and rushed me straight there - he literally saved my life. Now I carry adrenaline with me everywhere.</p> <p>As a practitioner, being a patient was an invaluable experience. That and seeing the way people I was close to were dealt with by the medical profession helped me decide to go into private practice, after a couple of years working in the NHS. There was no room within the NHS to listen to people, give them time and understand more about their life. We never asked patients, 'Which foods do you love?' but you can find out so much if you know what they crave - a child with lactose intolerance will crave dairy products, for example, because our bodies crave what they're not meant to have. You need to give people permission to enjoy what they can have, rather than focusing on what they think you are going to say they can't have. Women with migraines often crave orange juice in the mornings, but that may be exactly what triggers the problem, so I suggest mango instead. I offer patients a glass of wine at my practice so they can relax. As soon as they realise I am not a holier-than-thou woman in a white coat, it can work.</p> <p>One man, who had been diagnosed with high cholesterol levels six months earlier, came to see me at my practice with his fianc\u00e9e. He had put himself on a really strict cholesterol-free diet, refusing to eat in restaurants or at friends' houses. She just wanted to get back to some sort of normality. As we talked, he began to lighten up and I asked, 'How's your sex life?' They both went bright red and she said, 'How do you know?' I knew because if you bring your cholesterol level down really quickly, it interferes with your testosterone. We joked about it, and now he's eating a little butter and cheese with fruit or oatcakes to inhibit the absorption of the cholesterol. Some patients with high cholesterol are given lists of all the things they can't have by their doctors - no eggs and no seafood is often advised - but the truth is that while seafood contains cholesterol, it gets broken down and therefore doesn't raise blood cholesterol levels.</p> <p>I see a lot of people with cancer, some of whom have tried every other avenue and think I can make everything all right, but I can't. I can't stop people dying, that's one of the hardest parts of the job, but I can make their lives and their families' lives more enjoyable and positive. One man I looked after when I was working with HIV-positive people for the NHS in Nottingham was in his last few days. He could hardly eat anything but he loved talking about food - which restaurants I'd been to, what I'd had to eat. That was far better therapy than someone walking in with a drink in a box and saying, 'That's all you are allowed to eat.'</p> <p>More common complaints include waking up in the morning feeling that you haven't had a good night's rest, or coming home absolutely on your knees after work. I encourage these patients to have an afternoon snack, drink more water during the day, and eat more protein at lunch, which can keep mood and energy levels higher.</p> <p>I also see people with weight problems and some of them want to be put on a diet and told, 'This is what you have for lunch, this is what you have for supper.' That's not the way I work. I'll teach them about how their appetite mechanism works, concentrating on juggling tastes and textures, so they get the maximum satisfaction from eating. I can help, but they have to have the motivation and work out the lifestyle changes for themselves. The way we eat, rushing food without savouring it like the French or Italians, is one of the most difficult things to change. People who have irritated bowels or bad skin may be so stressed that they eat too quickly and their bodies can't get the goodness from their food. Eating more slowly, really tasting and enjoying your food and drinking more water to help the vitamins and minerals come out of the food are three basic things that I would recommend to everyone.</p> <p>Don't ask me what my favourite food or restaurant is - it depends on my mood. But I love Italian food, grilled vegetables and risotto, say, and I love cooking that for friends. I like to have something I can't eat at home and for that reason I love going to Lindsay House in Soho. If there's nothing I really fancy when I'm eating out, I just have a little bit of something and then eat when I get home. I'm not hugely fussy, but I would rather have a boiled egg and toast than go out for a kebab. I'm not passing judgement on that - it's just not part of my psyche.</p> <p>Of course, I really crave things - ooh yes, I love Kettle chips, especially the black- pepper ones, and peanuts, olives, snacking on a bit of chorizo sausage. My cravings have always been for salty things. A bar of chocolate can stay in my fridge for ages. I'll probably cook with it, and one of my favourite desserts is chocolate mousse. I think that's heaven. Sometimes people say that I talk about food as if I'm talking about sex. But food is a sensory thing - so why not?</p> <p>My mission is to encourage you to make the connection between what you put into your stomach and the way in which your life unfolds as a result. Having previously written two books - Bodyfoods for Women and Bodyfoods for Life - I thought it was time to explore eating habits more widely, to see how simple dishes and the way we put them together can help us tune into what our body needs. I hope that the following extracts from my new Bodyfoods Cookbook will inspire you to adopt delicious and nutritious eating habits that are both easy and achievable. I've kept things simple because you shouldn't have to hunt hard to find ingredients - you can hopefully find the ingredients to make everything from simple snacks to more exotic dinner party 'hits' in your local supermarket or delicatessen. The ingredients contained in every recipe have been included with the sole purpose of combining flavour with health-giving properties, but each recipe also features a 'magic ingredient', an ingredient that has a specific health-giving quality.</p> <p><b> Breakfast-time boosts</b></p> <p>Despite the saying 'Breakfast like a king, lunch like a knave and dine like a pauper', there is no hard-and-fast rule about when, or how much, you should eat. Instead, it's a question of understanding how your body responds to food and how you can maximise your wellbeing through eating. Breakfast provides an invaluable opportunity to enable you to do the latter. A bowl of fresh fruit salad eaten shortly after getting up, for example, will provide a slow release of energy to help you to get through the morning, as well as a good dose of vitamins and minerals. Scrambled eggs on toast, on the other hand, supply a dose of protein that goes towards building up your muscles, which is particularly necessary if you expend a lot of physical energy throughout the day.</p> <p>Everyone responds differently to food in the morning: some people feel sleepy and unable to function after eating a large breakfast, whereas others need a hearty breakfast before they embark upon the day's activities. Although there is a lot of confusion about the necessity of having breakfast as a result of these differing reactions, it is important to consider the scientific evidence. It has been proven that the body performs and feels better if you eat something (however little) between waking up and having lunch. Because you have had to rely on your body's nutrient reserves to keep you going overnight, the morning is the best time to start topping them up again. Scientific studies have furthermore shown that children who either skip breakfast or eat very little at the start of the day are at a disadvantage when compared with those who eat a healthy breakfast. This is because the brains of children who have empty stomachs tend to receive less than the ideal level of blood sugar. Although this doesn't mean that they're likely to keel over at any moment, certain parts of their memories may not work as well as they should, which may cause problems at school. Children who've breakfasted properly generally have better reaction times and are also more proficient at such problem-solving exercises as mental arithmetic (this is most apparent in children with lower IQs).</p> <p>A well-nourished brain can improve adults' ability to recall information, too, because it has received sufficient fuel (that is, sugar) to enable it to perform effectively. Before you start reaching for a sugar lump, however, you should understand that the sugar = brain-fuel formula is not that simple. For example, if you eat a sugar lump or gulp down a can of sweetened 'sports drink' first thing in the morning when you have an empty stomach, your blood-sugar level will shoot up, consequently stimulating your body to secrete a large amount of insulin (the hormone that transfers sugar from the blood to the body's cells). This insulin reaction will in turn cause your blood-sugar level to plummet, thus leaving your brain with very little sugar to work with.</p> <p>Instead, the best way in which to deliver sugar to your brain is to package it within a high-fibre, carbohydrate-rich food, such as wholemeal bread, wholegrain cereal, oats or fresh fruit. The fibre in such foods helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is released into the blood and carried to the brain, thereby enabling you to remain focused.</p> <p>The wide range of high-fibre, carbohydrate-rich foods offers you flexibility and choice at breakfast time. If time is short in the morning, how about a pur\u00e9ed fruit drink, such as a banana and pineapple smoothie? Smoothies (pur\u00e9ed fruit drinks) are ideal breakfasts, being both quick to make and containing energising properties. They are also a good way in which to give children a vitamin boost at the beginning of the day. Refreshing and revitalising drinks, they can be made with various combinations of fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, apricots, peaches and other seasonal fruits, with or without added yogurt. Try adding a few baked fruits or a spoonful of pur\u00e9ed fruit to smoothies, as these give a slightly different texture. This breakfast can be eaten at home, as well as at the gym after a work-out, or after you've arrived at the office.</p> <p>If your early mornings are not so rushed, relaxing over a wild-mushroom omelette with fresh herbs is a highly effective way in which to prepare yourself for some productive hours. However, pregnant women and people who have compromised immune systems should avoid eating undercooked and soft-boiled eggs. Although children under the age of eight or nine months can eat cooked egg yolks, egg whites are more challenging to a young gut, so you should wait until your children are a year old before feeding them eggs. Remember that breakfast doesn't have to be eaten at a set time each day, although you should try to have something within a couple of hours of getting up. Another good reason why you should eat a little something in the morning is because your digestive system performs much more efficiently if it is allowed to work on a small amount of food every few hours.</p> <p><b> Long and short lunches</b></p> <p>Lunches have changed over the past 50 years. Gone are the days when we stopped work for a couple of hours and went home to tuck into the substantial main meal of the day. By contrast, today it's more often a question of making a quick dash to the sandwich shop and then hastily consuming our purchase while working, or perhaps worse still, having a couple of mouthfuls of the children's left-overs, followed by a quick cup of coffee and a chocolate biscuit. For many of us, taking the time to have lunch seems like too much of an indulgence, one that we save for the weekend, when we can afford the time and can also cope better with the sleepy feelings that we frequently experience when our stomachs are full.</p> <p>If we choose the foods that suit our bodies, lunch should provide the perfect opportunity to supply ourselves with nutritional, energising fuel. Yet many people don't like to take a food break in the middle of the day because they end up feeling far from energised, wanting instead to crawl into bed for a catnap. Because we lead demanding, highly stressed lives, we want and need to feel alert, not sleepy, during the afternoon.</p> <p>What many of us don't realise, however, is that the type of food that we eat, as well as the manner in which we eat it, influences how we feel. For instance, pasta, bread and other starchy foods encourage the brain to produce sleep-inducing hormones. This happens because these foods need to be digested slowly, which means that the stomach and digestive system (which is, after all, a muscle) require oxygen to perform their duties efficiently. The brain therefore secretes hormones that encourage us to sleep in order to diminish both our desire and physiological ability to divert oxygen from our stomach to our limbs to enable us to rush around. If we ignore the effect of these hormones, however, and instead command our limbs to move energetically, oxygen is diverted from the stomach, which frequently leads to indigestion, stomach cramps and bloating.</p> <p>In short, the brain's response to these starchy foods is one that is conditioned by physiological efficiency. If you have time to take a siesta after lunch, perhaps at the weekend, then by all means go ahead and make a dish like my pasta with courgettes and lemon or baby potatoes topped with guacamole and roasted peppers; eating these foods and then having a little snooze is the best way to allow your body to enjoy and digest them. If you don't have the time, however, choose a protein, fruit and vegetable-based lunch in which the proportion of vegetables, fruits and/or protein is high, such as my asparagus and lemon salad, a bowl of courgette and pea soup or a chunk of cheese with some figs, grapes and crisp, green celery. By opting for such foods, your body's hormonal response will encourage, not hinder, your desire to be energetic in the afternoon.</p> <p>There is a further benefit of having a protein-rich lunch, too. Proteins are made up of amino acids, two of which, L-phenylalanine and tryptophan, encourage the body to produce endorphins (mood-enhancing hormones). Eating a protein-rich lunch, like my sea bass with crab, chicken Caesar salad or some lean charcuterie with cherry tomatoes, therefore not only helps to prevent the mood swings that may occur mid-afternoon, but also enables your body's blood-sugar levels to remain more constant (which means that you shouldn't experience 'sugar dips' at 4pm). If eating protein-rich foods doesn't appeal to you, having a fruit- or vegetable-based lunch, like a bowl of soup followed by some fruit, can similarly energise your body.</p> <p>If you are organised and a little eclectic in your thinking, you can turn lunch into an interesting affair, rather than settling for the which-sandwich-bores-me-least? option. Practicality is usually a big issue, which is why sandwich bars may initially appear to be your only resort as a convenient source of lunch, but why not make a large cauldron of soup or a tray of grilled vegetables at home at the weekend to take to work in small plastic containers and then heat them up in the microwave at work (if your office has one)? Alternatively, if for reasons of practicality or preference, bread is your staple food for lunch, remember that you don't have to stick to the traditional sandwich made up of two slices of sliced bread with something in the middle.</p> <p>Many different, mouth-watering types of breads are readily available today, such as ciabatta, focaccia or flat bread, which you can either make into wraps or warm up and eat with dips and crudit\u00e9s; muffins, too, can be topped or filled with lean, protein-rich foods and salads. In order to vary its texture and taste, you could also toast some bread to serve with a bowl of hearty soup, while an open focaccia sandwich like my focaccia with chargrilled peppers and ham will show off its topping in a gloriously sensory-stimulating manner.</p> <p>Turn lunch into a delightful, energising interlude in the middle of what would otherwise be a hectic, draining day. Half an hour or so is plenty of time in which to eat something nutritious and delicious, and taking a break will also allow you to step back from your busy routine for a while and refresh both your body and mind.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,341330,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read Jane Clarke's Bodyfood recipes here</a></p> <p><b> Next week</b> sustaining suppers, ideas for entertaining, plus, coping with insomnia, and how to improve your sex life.</p> <p>\u0095 The above text is excerpted from Jane Clarke's Bodyfoods Cookbook (Cassell &amp; Co, \u00a318.99).</p>",

Even then I cared about food - laying a tray, not just plonking fruit and cheese on a board but adding grapes and walnuts - because that's what Auntie May used to do. The way food looks is very important - when I first went into private practice, I used to keep recipe books in my rooms to stimulate patients. I still don't really use them myself, although I love Claudia Roden - it's all so simple and her love of food shines through in her writing. As a teenager, I was interested in studying medicine, but I wanted to use food instead of drugs. My dad was a chemistry teacher and arranged for me to spend the day with a friend who was a dietician, an experience that encouraged me to do a dietetics degree at Leeds University. Unfortunately I hated it. It didn't live up to my expectations of using food in a passionate, healing and enjoyable way. Immediately afterwards, before going into practice as a dietician, I did a Cordon Bleu course to try and get some of the passion back. Being with people who wanted to cook with chocolate, or spending hours making filo pastry or Chelsea buns, just like Auntie May, was lovely. Now if I'm feeling really stressed, shopping for food and cooking is what really lifts me. A perfect day would start with going down to Borough Market, by the Thames, where there are lots of small specialist producers, seeing what I fancy and then spending the rest of the day cooking and having friends round. Making a risotto and having a glass of wine while you do it is heaven. I love the Spanish and Moroccan style of eating, too, with lots of little dishes - say, roasted onions with a rich tomato sauce, asparagus and a few olives - because I'm never satisfied with one taste. I also love picnics and last summer did a very big one for about 12 friends. We had poussin with preserved lemons and rosemary, and a sea bass in rock salt each, with loads of leafy salads and berries. Unfortunately, I couldn't have the strawberries, as my family is atopic, which means they have heightened sensitivity to certain allergens - some of them get eczema and hay fever, for example - but my particular allergy only emerged about 18 months ago. It was a bit of a joke at first. I'd slept badly, had a bit of a headache, and when I got up and looked in the mirror my face was all swollen - I looked as if I'd put a stone on overnight, but it went down with some anti-histamine and steroids. Over the next six months, I had about six or seven of these episodes, and eventually I identified that they were caused by tuna, salmon, strawberries and melon. Then I went to my Nana's funeral in Stoke-on-Trent and had a mouthful of salad that had salmon or tuna in it at lunch and went into full anaphylactic shock - my face and tongue swelled up and my blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate dropped. I was very lucky - my brother knew where the nearest hospital was and rushed me straight there - he literally saved my life. Now I carry adrenaline with me everywhere. As a practitioner, being a patient was an invaluable experience. That and seeing the way people I was close to were dealt with by the medical profession helped me decide to go into private practice, after a couple of years working in the NHS. There was no room within the NHS to listen to people, give them time and understand more about their life. We never asked patients, 'Which foods do you love?' but you can find out so much if you know what they crave - a child with lactose intolerance will crave dairy products, for example, because our bodies crave what they're not meant to have. You need to give people permission to enjoy what they can have, rather than focusing on what they think you are going to say they can't have. Women with migraines often crave orange juice in the mornings, but that may be exactly what triggers the problem, so I suggest mango instead. I offer patients a glass of wine at my practice so they can relax. As soon as they realise I am not a holier-than-thou woman in a white coat, it can work. One man, who had been diagnosed with high cholesterol levels six months earlier, came to see me at my practice with his fianc\u00e9e. He had put himself on a really strict cholesterol-free diet, refusing to eat in restaurants or at friends' houses. She just wanted to get back to some sort of normality. As we talked, he began to lighten up and I asked, 'How's your sex life?' They both went bright red and she said, 'How do you know?' I knew because if you bring your cholesterol level down really quickly, it interferes with your testosterone. We joked about it, and now he's eating a little butter and cheese with fruit or oatcakes to inhibit the absorption of the cholesterol. Some patients with high cholesterol are given lists of all the things they can't have by their doctors - no eggs and no seafood is often advised - but the truth is that while seafood contains cholesterol, it gets broken down and therefore doesn't raise blood cholesterol levels. I see a lot of people with cancer, some of whom have tried every other avenue and think I can make everything all right, but I can't. I can't stop people dying, that's one of the hardest parts of the job, but I can make their lives and their families' lives more enjoyable and positive. One man I looked after when I was working with HIV-positive people for the NHS in Nottingham was in his last few days. He could hardly eat anything but he loved talking about food - which restaurants I'd been to, what I'd had to eat. That was far better therapy than someone walking in with a drink in a box and saying, 'That's all you are allowed to eat.' More common complaints include waking up in the morning feeling that you haven't had a good night's rest, or coming home absolutely on your knees after work. I encourage these patients to have an afternoon snack, drink more water during the day, and eat more protein at lunch, which can keep mood and energy levels higher. I also see people with weight problems and some of them want to be put on a diet and told, 'This is what you have for lunch, this is what you have for supper.' That's not the way I work. I'll teach them about how their appetite mechanism works, concentrating on juggling tastes and textures, so they get the maximum satisfaction from eating. I can help, but they have to have the motivation and work out the lifestyle changes for themselves. The way we eat, rushing food without savouring it like the French or Italians, is one of the most difficult things to change. People who have irritated bowels or bad skin may be so stressed that they eat too quickly and their bodies can't get the goodness from their food. Eating more slowly, really tasting and enjoying your food and drinking more water to help the vitamins and minerals come out of the food are three basic things that I would recommend to everyone. Don't ask me what my favourite food or restaurant is - it depends on my mood. But I love Italian food, grilled vegetables and risotto, say, and I love cooking that for friends. I like to have something I can't eat at home and for that reason I love going to Lindsay House in Soho. If there's nothing I really fancy when I'm eating out, I just have a little bit of something and then eat when I get home. I'm not hugely fussy, but I would rather have a boiled egg and toast than go out for a kebab. I'm not passing judgement on that - it's just not part of my psyche. Of course, I really crave things - ooh yes, I love Kettle chips, especially the black- pepper ones, and peanuts, olives, snacking on a bit of chorizo sausage. My cravings have always been for salty things. A bar of chocolate can stay in my fridge for ages. I'll probably cook with it, and one of my favourite desserts is chocolate mousse. I think that's heaven. Sometimes people say that I talk about food as if I'm talking about sex. But food is a sensory thing - so why not? My mission is to encourage you to make the connection between what you put into your stomach and the way in which your life unfolds as a result. Having previously written two books - Bodyfoods for Women and Bodyfoods for Life - I thought it was time to explore eating habits more widely, to see how simple dishes and the way we put them together can help us tune into what our body needs. I hope that the following extracts from my new Bodyfoods Cookbook will inspire you to adopt delicious and nutritious eating habits that are both easy and achievable. I've kept things simple because you shouldn't have to hunt hard to find ingredients - you can hopefully find the ingredients to make everything from simple snacks to more exotic dinner party 'hits' in your local supermarket or delicatessen. The ingredients contained in every recipe have been included with the sole purpose of combining flavour with health-giving properties, but each recipe also features a 'magic ingredient', an ingredient that has a specific health-giving quality. Breakfast-time boosts Despite the saying 'Breakfast like a king, lunch like a knave and dine like a pauper', there is no hard-and-fast rule about when, or how much, you should eat. Instead, it's a question of understanding how your body responds to food and how you can maximise your wellbeing through eating. Breakfast provides an invaluable opportunity to enable you to do the latter. A bowl of fresh fruit salad eaten shortly after getting up, for example, will provide a slow release of energy to help you to get through the morning, as well as a good dose of vitamins and minerals. Scrambled eggs on toast, on the other hand, supply a dose of protein that goes towards building up your muscles, which is particularly necessary if you expend a lot of physical energy throughout the day. Everyone responds differently to food in the morning: some people feel sleepy and unable to function after eating a large breakfast, whereas others need a hearty breakfast before they embark upon the day's activities. Although there is a lot of confusion about the necessity of having breakfast as a result of these differing reactions, it is important to consider the scientific evidence. It has been proven that the body performs and feels better if you eat something (however little) between waking up and having lunch. Because you have had to rely on your body's nutrient reserves to keep you going overnight, the morning is the best time to start topping them up again. Scientific studies have furthermore shown that children who either skip breakfast or eat very little at the start of the day are at a disadvantage when compared with those who eat a healthy breakfast. This is because the brains of children who have empty stomachs tend to receive less than the ideal level of blood sugar. Although this doesn't mean that they're likely to keel over at any moment, certain parts of their memories may not work as well as they should, which may cause problems at school. Children who've breakfasted properly generally have better reaction times and are also more proficient at such problem-solving exercises as mental arithmetic (this is most apparent in children with lower IQs). A well-nourished brain can improve adults' ability to recall information, too, because it has received sufficient fuel (that is, sugar) to enable it to perform effectively. Before you start reaching for a sugar lump, however, you should understand that the sugar = brain-fuel formula is not that simple. For example, if you eat a sugar lump or gulp down a can of sweetened 'sports drink' first thing in the morning when you have an empty stomach, your blood-sugar level will shoot up, consequently stimulating your body to secrete a large amount of insulin (the hormone that transfers sugar from the blood to the body's cells). This insulin reaction will in turn cause your blood-sugar level to plummet, thus leaving your brain with very little sugar to work with. Instead, the best way in which to deliver sugar to your brain is to package it within a high-fibre, carbohydrate-rich food, such as wholemeal bread, wholegrain cereal, oats or fresh fruit. The fibre in such foods helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is released into the blood and carried to the brain, thereby enabling you to remain focused. The wide range of high-fibre, carbohydrate-rich foods offers you flexibility and choice at breakfast time. If time is short in the morning, how about a pur\u00e9ed fruit drink, such as a banana and pineapple smoothie? Smoothies (pur\u00e9ed fruit drinks) are ideal breakfasts, being both quick to make and containing energising properties. They are also a good way in which to give children a vitamin boost at the beginning of the day. Refreshing and revitalising drinks, they can be made with various combinations of fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, apricots, peaches and other seasonal fruits, with or without added yogurt. Try adding a few baked fruits or a spoonful of pur\u00e9ed fruit to smoothies, as these give a slightly different texture. This breakfast can be eaten at home, as well as at the gym after a work-out, or after you've arrived at the office. If your early mornings are not so rushed, relaxing over a wild-mushroom omelette with fresh herbs is a highly effective way in which to prepare yourself for some productive hours. However, pregnant women and people who have compromised immune systems should avoid eating undercooked and soft-boiled eggs. Although children under the age of eight or nine months can eat cooked egg yolks, egg whites are more challenging to a young gut, so you should wait until your children are a year old before feeding them eggs. Remember that breakfast doesn't have to be eaten at a set time each day, although you should try to have something within a couple of hours of getting up. Another good reason why you should eat a little something in the morning is because your digestive system performs much more efficiently if it is allowed to work on a small amount of food every few hours. Long and short lunches Lunches have changed over the past 50 years. Gone are the days when we stopped work for a couple of hours and went home to tuck into the substantial main meal of the day. By contrast, today it's more often a question of making a quick dash to the sandwich shop and then hastily consuming our purchase while working, or perhaps worse still, having a couple of mouthfuls of the children's left-overs, followed by a quick cup of coffee and a chocolate biscuit. For many of us, taking the time to have lunch seems like too much of an indulgence, one that we save for the weekend, when we can afford the time and can also cope better with the sleepy feelings that we frequently experience when our stomachs are full. If we choose the foods that suit our bodies, lunch should provide the perfect opportunity to supply ourselves with nutritional, energising fuel. Yet many people don't like to take a food break in the middle of the day because they end up feeling far from energised, wanting instead to crawl into bed for a catnap. Because we lead demanding, highly stressed lives, we want and need to feel alert, not sleepy, during the afternoon. What many of us don't realise, however, is that the type of food that we eat, as well as the manner in which we eat it, influences how we feel. For instance, pasta, bread and other starchy foods encourage the brain to produce sleep-inducing hormones. This happens because these foods need to be digested slowly, which means that the stomach and digestive system (which is, after all, a muscle) require oxygen to perform their duties efficiently. The brain therefore secretes hormones that encourage us to sleep in order to diminish both our desire and physiological ability to divert oxygen from our stomach to our limbs to enable us to rush around. If we ignore the effect of these hormones, however, and instead command our limbs to move energetically, oxygen is diverted from the stomach, which frequently leads to indigestion, stomach cramps and bloating. In short, the brain's response to these starchy foods is one that is conditioned by physiological efficiency. If you have time to take a siesta after lunch, perhaps at the weekend, then by all means go ahead and make a dish like my pasta with courgettes and lemon or baby potatoes topped with guacamole and roasted peppers; eating these foods and then having a little snooze is the best way to allow your body to enjoy and digest them. If you don't have the time, however, choose a protein, fruit and vegetable-based lunch in which the proportion of vegetables, fruits and/or protein is high, such as my asparagus and lemon salad, a bowl of courgette and pea soup or a chunk of cheese with some figs, grapes and crisp, green celery. By opting for such foods, your body's hormonal response will encourage, not hinder, your desire to be energetic in the afternoon. There is a further benefit of having a protein-rich lunch, too. Proteins are made up of amino acids, two of which, L-phenylalanine and tryptophan, encourage the body to produce endorphins (mood-enhancing hormones). Eating a protein-rich lunch, like my sea bass with crab, chicken Caesar salad or some lean charcuterie with cherry tomatoes, therefore not only helps to prevent the mood swings that may occur mid-afternoon, but also enables your body's blood-sugar levels to remain more constant (which means that you shouldn't experience 'sugar dips' at 4pm). If eating protein-rich foods doesn't appeal to you, having a fruit- or vegetable-based lunch, like a bowl of soup followed by some fruit, can similarly energise your body. If you are organised and a little eclectic in your thinking, you can turn lunch into an interesting affair, rather than settling for the which-sandwich-bores-me-least? option. Practicality is usually a big issue, which is why sandwich bars may initially appear to be your only resort as a convenient source of lunch, but why not make a large cauldron of soup or a tray of grilled vegetables at home at the weekend to take to work in small plastic containers and then heat them up in the microwave at work (if your office has one)? Alternatively, if for reasons of practicality or preference, bread is your staple food for lunch, remember that you don't have to stick to the traditional sandwich made up of two slices of sliced bread with something in the middle. Many different, mouth-watering types of breads are readily available today, such as ciabatta, focaccia or flat bread, which you can either make into wraps or warm up and eat with dips and crudit\u00e9s; muffins, too, can be topped or filled with lean, protein-rich foods and salads. In order to vary its texture and taste, you could also toast some bread to serve with a bowl of hearty soup, while an open focaccia sandwich like my focaccia with chargrilled peppers and ham will show off its topping in a gloriously sensory-stimulating manner. Turn lunch into a delightful, energising interlude in the middle of what would otherwise be a hectic, draining day. Half an hour or so is plenty of time in which to eat something nutritious and delicious, and taking a break will also allow you to step back from your busy routine for a while and refresh both your body and mind.

      "body": "<p>You'd be hard pressed to find anybody with a bad word to say about Charlie Watts. He's a Rolling Stone, of course - and so, by definition, a legend - but there's more to it than that. After all, Mick Jagger is a Rolling Stone and people queue up to say bad things about him. Certainly, for a lot of drummers, Charlie Watts is the stick-wielding colossus by whom all others should be judged. I should know, I lived with a former drummer for years and had to sit through many a misty-eyed eulogy in the small hours. It was like a crash course in Charlie studies. Why Charlie was so talented. Why Charlie was such a class act. Why Charlie was so unassuming. Why Charlie was the undisputed God of backbeat. Hey, I wanted to scream (and sometimes did), screw Charlie, what about me? </p> <p>The 'Charlie effect' seems to carry through to people who have only the most glancing interest in the Stones. We might have a grudging soft spot for the ludicrous Mr Jagger. We might warm to charming, riff-crunching Keith Richards and his craz-eee sidekick Ronnie Wood. Some might even mourn the departure of Bill Wyman, who resigned in 1993, or, more pertinently, the death of Brian Jones, who drowned in his swimming pool in 1969, mere days after the official announcement that the Stones had sacked him. Charlie's the one, though. Charlie's the Stone who is so universally well liked that he commands instant respect without even trying. </p> <p>I remember the Manic Street Preachers once telling me how they'd bumped into Charlie Watts briefly at a recording studio, and what a 'gentleman' he'd seemed. To put this small compliment into perspective, it should be noted that the Manic Street Preachers is a band so hard to impress, if Elvis Presley rose from the dead and wanted to jam with them, they'd tell him to bring his own beer. </p> <p>It all seems to boil down to a certain quality which is as rare as hen's teeth in the music business, but which Charlie Watts is perceived to have in abundance. In a word, decency. You've got to hand it to a 59-year-old man who's played with the world's most infamous rock'n'roll band for 38 years, and stayed happily married to his wife, Shirley, for 36 of them. A man who, moreover, remains resolutely determined not to take his elevated position too seriously. 'There's a lot more interesting people around than rock'n'roll bands,' Charlie Watts tells me in no uncertain terms, over a lazy pub lunch. 'There's this huge cult grown up around rock'n'roll, but I never saw it myself. I don't mean I never saw it going on, I mean I just didn't \"get\" it.' </p> <p>And then, the drummer whose own rock'n'roll band inarguably rates among the most significant musical forces in global pan- cultural history, shifting literally hundreds of millions of records along the way, stares into his espresso, and ponders apparently without irony: 'What have we got to be so egotistical about?' </p> <p> Charlie and I meet first at The Observer photographer's studio in a small street in Islington which my A-Z hasn't heard of. I have to bang on a couple of graffiti-strewn doors before I finally find it, and by then I'm 15 minutes late. This isn't good, I think, as I barge my way into the studio. Charlie Watts has always seemed so organised and precise. The other Stones might have spent the best part of their careers resembling dishevelled tarts in a rock-themed brothel, but not Charlie Watts. He could be the type to take offence at the late arrival of a journalist. I needn't have worried. 'I didn't even know you were late,' says Charlie, when we're introduced. And with that, he gives one of his mellow grins, and trudges back to his stool for more photographs. </p> <p>Later, during the course of our conversation, Charlie Watts is to demonstrate again and again how important appearances are to him. Marvin Gaye: 'The coolest-looking man - the epitome of a black American.' Elvin Jones: 'Beautiful!' Duke Ellington: 'Stylish.' Kenny Clarke: 'Chic, like Fred Astaire.' Zoe Ball: 'She's really ugly, isn't she?' That last one, muttered as a casual aside during our drive to the pub-restaurant, was clearly an aberration for Charlie. He's definitely one for praising rather than denigrating, especially where his musical heroes are concerned. 'All the musicians I love look beautiful,' he says. 'The way a man looks as he plays, his style , is very important to me.' </p> <p>Charlie himself makes a point of being nicely turned out. The day I meet him, his sharp blue suit speaks of timeless chic and East End betting shops. The eyes are gentle, the swept-back silver hair is thinning but hanging in there. Then there's those Slavic cheekbones, and the delicate, surprising body. All the Stones are renowned for being shorter than you'd expect, but Charlie's slightness makes him seem shorter still. Right now, though, his body is rather less noteworthy than his body language. Staring into the camera lens, Charlie manages to look both serene and agonised - like a small boy having a tooth pulled at the dentist, who's determined not to cry in front of his mother. </p> <p>'I hate doing things like this,' he admits later. 'Interviews, videos, pictures, all of it. I'd prefer Keith to do it for me, but he can't really, can he?' </p> <p>Seeing as Charlie is promoting his latest solo project a tribute album - honouring jazz drummers, put together with fellow aficionado Jim Keltner - Keith Richards' sudden appearance in the publicity schedule might indeed be surprising. It's Charlie who's had the lifelong love for jazz, and who's done various acclaimed tours and albums with his own Charlie Watts Quintet. All these years on, the drummer still seems totally besotted by the genre that bit him first, long before he'd even heard the name Rolling Stones. Nor could anyone dismiss this latest outing as a simple case of 'vanity publishing'. A second CD features diverse contemporary ambient-techno-drum'n'bass mixes by artists such as Coldcut and The Propellorheads. However, the main record is a muso bath of purist excellence put together with obvious taste and passion. </p> <p>'I'd like it to sell,' says Charlie. 'Nobody ever brings a record out not wanting people to buy it. My wife doesn't like it, though,' he smiles. 'She prefers the Stones.' And which does Charlie prefer? 'I love both,' he says instantly. 'With the jazz, it's great being onstage with such wonderful players, and with the Stones, it's great being up there with your friends. I stand firmly with my rock'n'roll band - though I have to say,' his eyes narrow thoughtfully, 'I have always considered the Stones to be a great blues band - rock'n'roll to me is Little Richard.' </p> <p> We're sitting in the restaurant in the back of the pub. By now, Charlie has relaxed considerably. When we first came in, he'd sat, fidgeting, eyes averted, unable to make up his mind whether he wanted the interview to start or not. Usually, when you hear that a world-famous celebrity is 'shy', you take it with a pinch of salt, but Charlie's reserve seems genuine. When he finally thaws, he is friendly and courteous to a fault, but initially, his paralysing shyness hangs between us like an exclamation mark. You wouldn't believe any other Stone, but you trust Charlie Watts when he tells you that he never enjoyed the female attention the band got in the early days. </p> <p>'Girls chasing you down the street, screaming... horrible!' he says. But Charlie, I say, isn't that supposed to be every man's dream? 'Maybe it is,' he shrugs. 'But I hated it. It was quite flattering, I suppose. And it's fantastic to play to audiences like that. For me, that was the whole point of being chased down the street... Playing the drums was all I was ever interested in. The rest of it made me cringe. The girls only really loved Mick, Brian and Keith anyway,' he continues sagely. 'Bill and I were older, and Bill looked it then. He looks much younger now.' Charlie cackles. 'Bill used to have this terrible Tony Curtis haircut - Keith does this great impression of it.' </p> <p>The Stones themselves didn't seem to make much impression on Charlie in the very early days: 'I used to play with loads of bands, and the Stones were just another one. I thought they'd last three months, then a year, then three years, then I stopped counting.' He remembers them travelling together in a small van: 'Me and Keith were in the back, on a ledge, under a blanket. Brian conned his way into the front on account of his asthma.' Does he have any nostalgia for those years? </p> <p>'No,' says Charlie. 'We tour very well now - first class and Rolls-Royces, and that's the only way to do it. Those were valuable times, though, because that's how you became a working band. And we still are. There's bigger gaps between work, but we're still a working band.' Even when the Stones started to become a serious proposition, Charlie continued to consider them a blues band, and remained stubbornly resistant to the allure of rock'n'roll: 'To me, it was about as interesting as something like flower power,' he says. His eyes twinkle wickedly: 'That's just me, though.' </p> <p> Charlie Watts was born in 1941, the son of a British Rail lorry driver. He studied graphic design at Harrow Art College, then took a job in a West End advertising agency. Around this time, he started playing the drums for local acts, including Alexis Korner, and the Rolling Stones. He also met his future wife, Shirley - an art student and sculptress. They married, and had one daughter, Seraphina, born in 1968. </p> <p>Still very much together, Charlie and Shirley now live on their 16th-century stud farm in Devon, along with numerous horses and rescued greyhounds. Seraphina adjusted very badly when the Watts first returned from tax exile in France and, by all accounts, became a bit of a wild child. She got expelled from Millfield public school for smoking pot, but has since calmed down, and become a mother. 'It's difficult to be a good father when you're away from home so much,' says Charlie sadly. </p> <p>Recently, the Watts had to prosecute the husband-and-wife managers of their stud farm for fraudulent accounting. Apart from that, life Chez Charlie seems almost surreally idyllic. If the drummer reads at all, it's detective novels, or books on Hollywood in the 40s. His favourite music is jazz, or anything from Stevie Wonder to Stravinsky. The mood most likely to inspire him to put a record on is 'loneliness'. 'Not in a negative way,' says Charlie quickly. 'Just that feeling of being alone.' Solitude? 'Yes.' </p> <p>When I ask Charlie if he would prefer to live in London to be more 'in the centre of things', he points out: 'It isn't the centre of things for me, and hasn't been for 30 years.' Later, Charlie adds that London, along with America, is the place he feels least safe. Not that anywhere is totally safe these days for a rock star. The stabbing of Beatle George Harrison, last year, on his country estate in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, left Charlie very shaken. </p> <p>For those unfamiliar with the case, it was reported that Michael Abram broke into the house and stabbed Harrison, who fought him off with the help of his wife Olivia. 'But what George really went through was not in the papers,' says Charlie. 'I spoke to Ringo about a month after it happened and he told me exactly what went on, and it was horrific. George was stabbed about 40 times. It happened outside his bedroom on the landing. He would have been dead if he'd been lying in bed, he wouldn't have been able to fight. The papers did say that one wound punctured his lung, but a lot of the others were just as horrific. The man was slashing him everywhere. George's wife hit him again and again on the head with this brass lamp, but he just wouldn't stop. There was blood everywhere.' </p> <p>Charlie shakes his head ruefully: 'I think George is still going through trauma,' he says. 'He's bound to - he's lived in that house for 30 years. It's just so shocking that it should happen to a guy who's so...' he gropes for the right word - 'inoffensive. George has never been nasty to anyone, he's only ever preached love and peace. He's not like John Lennon: he's never made statements or anything.' Charlie sighs, bemused. 'He's just a very nice guitar player.' </p> <p>He doesn't say it but, going by the look on his face, Charlie obviously believes that anything that could happen to the bass player of the Beatles could also happen to the drummer of the Stones. Not that he's about to let it blight married bliss with Shirley. The Watts have long been considered to be among rock's most loving couples. While other Stones were busy going mad in the carnal and pharmaceutical sweetie shops of the 60s and 70s, Charlie was famous for retiring to his room to pine for his wife. Around this time, he developed a habit of drawing each bed he sleeps in on tour. 'It's a way of marking time,' he says. 'It's become such a fetish, I couldn't bear to miss one.' </p> <p>Charlie's devotion to Mrs Watts doesn't show any sign of abating. Shirley told an interviewer not so long ago how Charlie still tells her he loves her every single day and never, ever criticises her. This is precisely the sort of story that makes even the most music-illiterate of people worship Charlie Watts. Was it love at first sight? </p> <p>Charlie considers for a moment, pushing back his silver hair. 'Well, it was obviously very sexual, and I suppose that's love as well. I just_' he hesitates, ' wanted her, I suppose. She was so funny and clever, and she had the most infectious laugh you'd ever heard. And I loved the world she was in, the world of art and sculpting. I just admired Shirley very, very much.' He smiles. 'I still do.' </p> <p>Shirley was the main reason Charlie cites for coming back from the brink in the mid-80s when, inexplicably, he decided to go off the rails just as the other Stones were starting to calm down. Today, Charlie has a coffee, while I have a red wine. He hasn't drunk, smoked, or taken drugs for 15 years, and dismisses the period when he suddenly started overindulging as 'a mid-life thing, it must have been'. One thing's for sure, Charlie wasn't short of bad influences. Many of his jazz heroes, including Charlie Parker, succumbed to drugs, and the Rolling Stones entourage was famously packed solid with 24/7 party people. </p> <p>Charlie's personal slide started with drinking too much. 'Probably a normal day's quota for most people, but too much for me. Then it became regular.' From there, Charlie went on to booze, amphetamines and heroin. His daughter would look at him most mornings and declare he reminded her of Dracula. Shirley was in despair and on the verge of leaving. It lasted for about two years. </p> <p>That's quite a long time to be_ I hesitate, wondering how to politely finish the sentence. </p> <p>'That out of it?' says Charlie helpfully. </p> <p>I tell him I could imagine him boozing, but I couldn't imagine him getting involved with heroin. </p> <p>'Well, I did,' says Charlie. 'Very easily. And drugs are very hard to give up. For me, anyway. I didn't even take that many. I wasn't that badly affected, I wasn't a junkie, but giving up drugs was very, very hard. Much, much harder than the rest of it.' </p> <p>The turning point came when he broke his ankle. 'I was drunk,' says Charlie. 'I slipped down the steps when I was in the cellar getting a bottle of wine. I happened to be booked for a jazz show at Ronnie Scott's in six weeks' time, and it really brought it home to me how far down I'd gone. I just stopped everything - drinking, smoking, taking drugs, everything, all at once. I just thought, enough is enough .' </p> <p>The Stones have had other troubles in recent times. In 1998, they were universally castigated as 'greedy' for axeing the British leg of their last 'Bridges To Babylon' tour, to avoid an unexpected \u00a310m tax bill brought about by a new budget. The Stones played the dates the following year, but the damage was done. 'We didn't cancel that tour,' says Charlie, exasperated. 'They moved the goalposts, and we moved them again.' He's drily cynical about why people persist in wanting to see the Stones play live after all these years. 'Maybe they're hoping we'll fall over at long last. It would be an occasion, wouldn't it?' </p> <p>There's also the fact that, offstage as well as on, the Stones continue to put on a good show. There was Mick Jagger's divorce from Jerry Hall, and his much-publicised love child with Brazilian model Luciana Morad. 'Mick's a very strict, very good father,' reveals Charlie. 'Very much \"Do As I Say, Not As I Do\".' </p> <p>Then, a week or so after I talk with Charlie, Ron Wood is in the papers, having checked into the Priory for the usual 'tired and emotional' problems. However, when Charlie and I speak, all is calm in the Stones' camp, and the drummer talks warmly of his bandmates, commending Jagger's 'zest for life' and Wood's 'lovely, fun-loving' nature. </p> <p> 'Keith is the most interesting, the most different of us all, though,' says Charlie. 'He's a man of vision, and one of the few people who hasn't really changed over the years. Wherever he goes, whatever he does, he's always Keith. He'll be in his room and all the stuff that makes him Keith will be there. The music's going, the wine's there, his guitar's there, and he'll be sitting in the middle of it all like some wonderful sultan. ' Charlie beams. 'It's fantastic. It's not a new thing, it's the way he's always been.' </p> <p>And what about Brian Jones, I ask, do you ever think of him? </p> <p>'No,' says Charlie quite sharply, and his face clouds over. </p> <p>'Well, actually, yeah,' he says, after a second's pause. 'Of course I think about Brian. Now and again, I'll see something which reminds me of him and I'll remember the laughs we used to have. He was a bit fey, though,' says Charlie pointedly. 'And he could be very cruel, contrary to his angelic looks. He was a terror with girls. People could be dropped in the most awful way. I always used to wonder how he coped with the worry of it all, the babies and whatever. He obviously didn't even think of it. </p> <p>'Brian had this horrible streak,' says Charlie. 'John Lennon had it, too. John could be one of the nicest, most hilarious people you'd ever meet, but he could also be a cruel bugger. He used this terrible rapier-like wit to kick people down. Obviously, a very talented man, but, to me, John was just like everybody I went to art school with - funny, flippant, but he'd walk over anybody who got in his way.' Charlie sighs. 'Not the nicest person in the world, and Brian was the same.' </p> <p>What about the conspiracy theories that Brian was murdered? </p> <p> Charlie says: 'All that about Brian being knocked off is rubbish. I know a lot of people would have willingly knocked him off, but it didn't happen. Brian was just very weak. He was asthmatic, unhealthy. The stuff he took - uppers, downers, leapers, bleepers, whatever they were too strong for his body. He couldn't take it. And his swimming pool was about 70 degrees or something - it used to shimmer with heat. You'd drive down there on a spring morning and the heat would be rising off the top. And he got in there, and I suppose it was like getting into a warm bath, and he fell asleep. And_ that's how he died.' Charlie's voice trails away. He suddenly looks very tired. </p> <p>Are you surprised, I ask, by the number of casualties there have been in and around the Stones' camp over the years? </p> <p>'Surprised?' says Charlie wryly, looking me straight in the eye. 'I'm amazed there haven't been more.' </p> <p>It's time for Charlie to leave. He has to go and record a Radio 2 interview with his old friend, jazz maestro George Melly. 'Good!' cries Charlie, with blatant relief, when I click the tape recorder off. I slip it quickly into my bag to save him the displeasure of looking at what is so obviously an instrument of torture. 'Are you coming along?' asks Charlie, smiling. 'George is hilarious. Very jazz !' </p> <p>Charlie is right. Melly is hilarious and probably 'very jazz' too, whatever that means. Charlie certainly seems to relax beautifully when he's with Melly - the pressure is off, and all he has to think about are his favourite jazz records. When we all go to the bar after the radio show, I initially sit slightly apart from Melly and Charlie, thinking they'll appreciate some privacy. Charlie will have none of it. 'Come and sit here!' he orders, thumping the table, all kind bossiness. I switch the tape recorder on a couple more times, when the conversation turns interesting, but Charlie looks so pained, it's soon banished to my bag for good. </p> <p>Then the change in Charlie Watts is quite amazing. He loses his haunted, wary look, and becomes playful, fun, delighted when Melly teases me, pretending to be entranced by my 'ideal' colouring: 'A raven bleeding to death in snow,' booms Melly. 'What do you think, Charlie?' He just chuckles merrily, and gives me and the rest of the room a dazzling smile that is a wink, a grin, and a leap for joy combined. I'm Charlie Watts, the smile seems to be saying - I'm perfectly relaxed, totally 'jazz'. </p> <p>\u2022 Charlie Watts's album, Charlie Watts/Jim Keltner Project, is released on Monday by Virgin</p>",

      "bodyText": "You'd be hard pressed to find anybody with a bad word to say about Charlie Watts. He's a Rolling Stone, of course - and so, by definition, a legend - but there's more to it than that. After all, Mick Jagger is a Rolling Stone and people queue up to say bad things about him. Certainly, for a lot of drummers, Charlie Watts is the stick-wielding colossus by whom all others should be judged. I should know, I lived with a former drummer for years and had to sit through many a misty-eyed eulogy in the small hours. It was like a crash course in Charlie studies. Why Charlie was so talented. Why Charlie was such a class act. Why Charlie was so unassuming. Why Charlie was the undisputed God of backbeat. Hey, I wanted to scream (and sometimes did), screw Charlie, what about me? The 'Charlie effect' seems to carry through to people who have only the most glancing interest in the Stones. We might have a grudging soft spot for the ludicrous Mr Jagger. We might warm to charming, riff-crunching Keith Richards and his craz-eee sidekick Ronnie Wood. Some might even mourn the departure of Bill Wyman, who resigned in 1993, or, more pertinently, the death of Brian Jones, who drowned in his swimming pool in 1969, mere days after the official announcement that the Stones had sacked him. Charlie's the one, though. Charlie's the Stone who is so universally well liked that he commands instant respect without even trying. I remember the Manic Street Preachers once telling me how they'd bumped into Charlie Watts briefly at a recording studio, and what a 'gentleman' he'd seemed. To put this small compliment into perspective, it should be noted that the Manic Street Preachers is a band so hard to impress, if Elvis Presley rose from the dead and wanted to jam with them, they'd tell him to bring his own beer. It all seems to boil down to a certain quality which is as rare as hen's teeth in the music business, but which Charlie Watts is perceived to have in abundance. In a word, decency. You've got to hand it to a 59-year-old man who's played with the world's most infamous rock'n'roll band for 38 years, and stayed happily married to his wife, Shirley, for 36 of them. A man who, moreover, remains resolutely determined not to take his elevated position too seriously. 'There's a lot more interesting people around than rock'n'roll bands,' Charlie Watts tells me in no uncertain terms, over a lazy pub lunch. 'There's this huge cult grown up around rock'n'roll, but I never saw it myself. I don't mean I never saw it going on, I mean I just didn't \"get\" it.' And then, the drummer whose own rock'n'roll band inarguably rates among the most significant musical forces in global pan- cultural history, shifting literally hundreds of millions of records along the way, stares into his espresso, and ponders apparently without irony: 'What have we got to be so egotistical about?' Charlie and I meet first at The Observer photographer's studio in a small street in Islington which my A-Z hasn't heard of. I have to bang on a couple of graffiti-strewn doors before I finally find it, and by then I'm 15 minutes late. This isn't good, I think, as I barge my way into the studio. Charlie Watts has always seemed so organised and precise. The other Stones might have spent the best part of their careers resembling dishevelled tarts in a rock-themed brothel, but not Charlie Watts. He could be the type to take offence at the late arrival of a journalist. I needn't have worried. 'I didn't even know you were late,' says Charlie, when we're introduced. And with that, he gives one of his mellow grins, and trudges back to his stool for more photographs. Later, during the course of our conversation, Charlie Watts is to demonstrate again and again how important appearances are to him. Marvin Gaye: 'The coolest-looking man - the epitome of a black American.' Elvin Jones: 'Beautiful!' Duke Ellington: 'Stylish.' Kenny Clarke: 'Chic, like Fred Astaire.' Zoe Ball: 'She's really ugly, isn't she?' That last one, muttered as a casual aside during our drive to the pub-restaurant, was clearly an aberration for Charlie. He's definitely one for praising rather than denigrating, especially where his musical heroes are concerned. 'All the musicians I love look beautiful,' he says. 'The way a man looks as he plays, his style , is very important to me.' Charlie himself makes a point of being nicely turned out. The day I meet him, his sharp blue suit speaks of timeless chic and East End betting shops. The eyes are gentle, the swept-back silver hair is thinning but hanging in there. Then there's those Slavic cheekbones, and the delicate, surprising body. All the Stones are renowned for being shorter than you'd expect, but Charlie's slightness makes him seem shorter still. Right now, though, his body is rather less noteworthy than his body language. Staring into the camera lens, Charlie manages to look both serene and agonised - like a small boy having a tooth pulled at the dentist, who's determined not to cry in front of his mother. 'I hate doing things like this,' he admits later. 'Interviews, videos, pictures, all of it. I'd prefer Keith to do it for me, but he can't really, can he?' Seeing as Charlie is promoting his latest solo project a tribute album - honouring jazz drummers, put together with fellow aficionado Jim Keltner - Keith Richards' sudden appearance in the publicity schedule might indeed be surprising. It's Charlie who's had the lifelong love for jazz, and who's done various acclaimed tours and albums with his own Charlie Watts Quintet. All these years on, the drummer still seems totally besotted by the genre that bit him first, long before he'd even heard the name Rolling Stones. Nor could anyone dismiss this latest outing as a simple case of 'vanity publishing'. A second CD features diverse contemporary ambient-techno-drum'n'bass mixes by artists such as Coldcut and The Propellorheads. However, the main record is a muso bath of purist excellence put together with obvious taste and passion. 'I'd like it to sell,' says Charlie. 'Nobody ever brings a record out not wanting people to buy it. My wife doesn't like it, though,' he smiles. 'She prefers the Stones.' And which does Charlie prefer? 'I love both,' he says instantly. 'With the jazz, it's great being onstage with such wonderful players, and with the Stones, it's great being up there with your friends. I stand firmly with my rock'n'roll band - though I have to say,' his eyes narrow thoughtfully, 'I have always considered the Stones to be a great blues band - rock'n'roll to me is Little Richard.' We're sitting in the restaurant in the back of the pub. By now, Charlie has relaxed considerably. When we first came in, he'd sat, fidgeting, eyes averted, unable to make up his mind whether he wanted the interview to start or not. Usually, when you hear that a world-famous celebrity is 'shy', you take it with a pinch of salt, but Charlie's reserve seems genuine. When he finally thaws, he is friendly and courteous to a fault, but initially, his paralysing shyness hangs between us like an exclamation mark. You wouldn't believe any other Stone, but you trust Charlie Watts when he tells you that he never enjoyed the female attention the band got in the early days. 'Girls chasing you down the street, screaming... horrible!' he says. But Charlie, I say, isn't that supposed to be every man's dream? 'Maybe it is,' he shrugs. 'But I hated it. It was quite flattering, I suppose. And it's fantastic to play to audiences like that. For me, that was the whole point of being chased down the street... Playing the drums was all I was ever interested in. The rest of it made me cringe. The girls only really loved Mick, Brian and Keith anyway,' he continues sagely. 'Bill and I were older, and Bill looked it then. He looks much younger now.' Charlie cackles. 'Bill used to have this terrible Tony Curtis haircut - Keith does this great impression of it.' The Stones themselves didn't seem to make much impression on Charlie in the very early days: 'I used to play with loads of bands, and the Stones were just another one. I thought they'd last three months, then a year, then three years, then I stopped counting.' He remembers them travelling together in a small van: 'Me and Keith were in the back, on a ledge, under a blanket. Brian conned his way into the front on account of his asthma.' Does he have any nostalgia for those years? 'No,' says Charlie. 'We tour very well now - first class and Rolls-Royces, and that's the only way to do it. Those were valuable times, though, because that's how you became a working band. And we still are. There's bigger gaps between work, but we're still a working band.' Even when the Stones started to become a serious proposition, Charlie continued to consider them a blues band, and remained stubbornly resistant to the allure of rock'n'roll: 'To me, it was about as interesting as something like flower power,' he says. His eyes twinkle wickedly: 'That's just me, though.' Charlie Watts was born in 1941, the son of a British Rail lorry driver. He studied graphic design at Harrow Art College, then took a job in a West End advertising agency. Around this time, he started playing the drums for local acts, including Alexis Korner, and the Rolling Stones. He also met his future wife, Shirley - an art student and sculptress. They married, and had one daughter, Seraphina, born in 1968. Still very much together, Charlie and Shirley now live on their 16th-century stud farm in Devon, along with numerous horses and rescued greyhounds. Seraphina adjusted very badly when the Watts first returned from tax exile in France and, by all accounts, became a bit of a wild child. She got expelled from Millfield public school for smoking pot, but has since calmed down, and become a mother. 'It's difficult to be a good father when you're away from home so much,' says Charlie sadly. Recently, the Watts had to prosecute the husband-and-wife managers of their stud farm for fraudulent accounting. Apart from that, life Chez Charlie seems almost surreally idyllic. If the drummer reads at all, it's detective novels, or books on Hollywood in the 40s. His favourite music is jazz, or anything from Stevie Wonder to Stravinsky. The mood most likely to inspire him to put a record on is 'loneliness'. 'Not in a negative way,' says Charlie quickly. 'Just that feeling of being alone.' Solitude? 'Yes.' When I ask Charlie if he would prefer to live in London to be more 'in the centre of things', he points out: 'It isn't the centre of things for me, and hasn't been for 30 years.' Later, Charlie adds that London, along with America, is the place he feels least safe. Not that anywhere is totally safe these days for a rock star. The stabbing of Beatle George Harrison, last year, on his country estate in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, left Charlie very shaken. For those unfamiliar with the case, it was reported that Michael Abram broke into the house and stabbed Harrison, who fought him off with the help of his wife Olivia. 'But what George really went through was not in the papers,' says Charlie. 'I spoke to Ringo about a month after it happened and he told me exactly what went on, and it was horrific. George was stabbed about 40 times. It happened outside his bedroom on the landing. He would have been dead if he'd been lying in bed, he wouldn't have been able to fight. The papers did say that one wound punctured his lung, but a lot of the others were just as horrific. The man was slashing him everywhere. George's wife hit him again and again on the head with this brass lamp, but he just wouldn't stop. There was blood everywhere.' Charlie shakes his head ruefully: 'I think George is still going through trauma,' he says. 'He's bound to - he's lived in that house for 30 years. It's just so shocking that it should happen to a guy who's so...' he gropes for the right word - 'inoffensive. George has never been nasty to anyone, he's only ever preached love and peace. He's not like John Lennon: he's never made statements or anything.' Charlie sighs, bemused. 'He's just a very nice guitar player.' He doesn't say it but, going by the look on his face, Charlie obviously believes that anything that could happen to the bass player of the Beatles could also happen to the drummer of the Stones. Not that he's about to let it blight married bliss with Shirley. The Watts have long been considered to be among rock's most loving couples. While other Stones were busy going mad in the carnal and pharmaceutical sweetie shops of the 60s and 70s, Charlie was famous for retiring to his room to pine for his wife. Around this time, he developed a habit of drawing each bed he sleeps in on tour. 'It's a way of marking time,' he says. 'It's become such a fetish, I couldn't bear to miss one.' Charlie's devotion to Mrs Watts doesn't show any sign of abating. Shirley told an interviewer not so long ago how Charlie still tells her he loves her every single day and never, ever criticises her. This is precisely the sort of story that makes even the most music-illiterate of people worship Charlie Watts. Was it love at first sight? Charlie considers for a moment, pushing back his silver hair. 'Well, it was obviously very sexual, and I suppose that's love as well. I just_' he hesitates, ' wanted her, I suppose. She was so funny and clever, and she had the most infectious laugh you'd ever heard. And I loved the world she was in, the world of art and sculpting. I just admired Shirley very, very much.' He smiles. 'I still do.' Shirley was the main reason Charlie cites for coming back from the brink in the mid-80s when, inexplicably, he decided to go off the rails just as the other Stones were starting to calm down. Today, Charlie has a coffee, while I have a red wine. He hasn't drunk, smoked, or taken drugs for 15 years, and dismisses the period when he suddenly started overindulging as 'a mid-life thing, it must have been'. One thing's for sure, Charlie wasn't short of bad influences. Many of his jazz heroes, including Charlie Parker, succumbed to drugs, and the Rolling Stones entourage was famously packed solid with 24/7 party people. Charlie's personal slide started with drinking too much. 'Probably a normal day's quota for most people, but too much for me. Then it became regular.' From there, Charlie went on to booze, amphetamines and heroin. His daughter would look at him most mornings and declare he reminded her of Dracula. Shirley was in despair and on the verge of leaving. It lasted for about two years. That's quite a long time to be_ I hesitate, wondering how to politely finish the sentence. 'That out of it?' says Charlie helpfully.

I didn't even take that many. I wasn't that badly affected, I wasn't a junkie, but giving up drugs was very, very hard. Much, much harder than the rest of it.' The turning point came when he broke his ankle. 'I was drunk,' says Charlie. 'I slipped down the steps when I was in the cellar getting a bottle of wine. I happened to be booked for a jazz show at Ronnie Scott's in six weeks' time, and it really brought it home to me how far down I'd gone. I just stopped everything - drinking, smoking, taking drugs, everything, all at once. I just thought, enough is enough .' The Stones have had other troubles in recent times. In 1998, they were universally castigated as 'greedy' for axeing the British leg of their last 'Bridges To Babylon' tour, to avoid an unexpected \u00a310m tax bill brought about by a new budget. The Stones played the dates the following year, but the damage was done. 'We didn't cancel that tour,' says Charlie, exasperated. 'They moved the goalposts, and we moved them again.' He's drily cynical about why people persist in wanting to see the Stones play live after all these years. 'Maybe they're hoping we'll fall over at long last. It would be an occasion, wouldn't it?' There's also the fact that, offstage as well as on, the Stones continue to put on a good show. There was Mick Jagger's divorce from Jerry Hall, and his much-publicised love child with Brazilian model Luciana Morad. 'Mick's a very strict, very good father,' reveals Charlie. 'Very much \"Do As I Say, Not As I Do\".' Then, a week or so after I talk with Charlie, Ron Wood is in the papers, having checked into the Priory for the usual 'tired and emotional' problems.

      "body": "<p>Beauty salons and hairdressers have traditionally been viewed as the territory of the woman with time on her hands, the lady who lunches. But over the past few years, increasing numbers of women have started regarding professional hair and beauty care as an essential part of their working and social lives. </p> <p>Andrew Clark, creative director of Nicky Clarke's hair salon in Mayfair, says it is not unusual to find executive women coming into the salon for a blow-dry every morning as part of their daily routine. </p> <p>'They've usually got their mobile telephones plugged into their ears, and it's just a part of their job to look good,' he says. </p> <p>A quick look at the Nicky Clarke price list shows that their salaries or business expense accounts must be impressive. An appointment with one of the salon's lesser-known stylists can costs from \u00a345, depending on their experience at the salon. But an initial appointment with the man himself - and you may have to wait up to three weeks for a time of his choice - will cost you \u00a3300. A fast-track appointment (which limits the wait to two or three days) is \u00a3500. The average client spends around \u00a3180 a visit. </p> <p>Most women teach themselves to apply makeup, but many now have a 'makeover' from a professional makeup artist. Ariane Poole, an independent consultant and makeup adviser for Boots No 7, has clients who book in twice a year for a complete assessment. A lesson with her normally lasts between two and three hours, and costs \u00a3250. </p> <p>Poole goes through your makeup bag, discusses the look you want, and sorts out makeup for days and evenings. Her clients range from housewives to high-flying professionals. </p> <p>Beauty salons are cheaper, about \u00a320 for a 45-minute 'cleanse and makeup' session, or \u00a335 for a complete makeup 'lesson' lasting an hour. </p> <p>Bridal makeup costs slightly more, at \u00a345, but includes a practice session as well as application for the big day itself. </p> <p>Manicures are also becoming more mainstream. The concept of the nail bar- a manicure salon which you can walk into without an appointment and get your nails done at a reasonably low price - has finally crossed the Atlantic to the UK high street. A basic salon manicure costs about \u00a315 and takes up to 45 minutes; a nail bar will turn you round in 15 minutes for \u00a310. Branches of the New York Nail Company and Nails Inc are sprouting up in London. Boots is set to start a walk-in manicure service in major stores this month. </p> <p><strong>Hair today, gone tomorrow - for \u00a31,000</strong></p> <p>Hair removal - one of the cheapest beauty processes if you use a razor and soap - becomes the most expensive if you have laser treatment. At the Laser Clinic in London's Harley Street, denuding an upper lip costs about \u00a3100 a session. A bikini line will cost between \u00a3250 and \u00a3400, while a full leg costs from \u00a3600 to \u00a3900. Success depends on zapping the hair follicles while they are growing, so you may need up to six sessions to remove all your unwanted fuzz. </p> <p>One women recently spent \u00a31,000 having her upper lip, armpits, bikini line and lower legs lasered - and she faces five more treatments.The effects are meant to be permanent, but hormonal changes such as the menopause may bring new hair. </p> <p>The process is very quick and relatively painless. Your skin is chilled before being exposed to a laser beam, which is as uncomfortable as someone pinging elastic bands against your skin. A session normally takes between half an hour and an hour. Afterwards the skin becomes quite tender and blotchy - side-effects that can last from half an hour to two weeks. </p> <p>In contrast, waxing hurts - don't let any beautician tell you otherwise - but it is much cheaper: about \u00a314 for lower legs, and \u00a38 for a bikini line and underarms. It has to be repeated every six weeks if you want to remain hair-free. Having your lower legs professionally waxed from the age of 30 to 60 would cost more than \u00a33,600. </p> <p>Likewise, electrolysis can be uncomfortable, leaving little red burn marks if the current is not applied properly. It costs about \u00a310 per 10- or 15- minute session. These have to be repeated many times, and even then the hair may not be killed. </p> <p><strong>Beauty on a budget</strong></p> <p>If you are prepared to compromise, there are many ways of achieving good results at little cost: </p> <p> \u0095 Get your hair done cheaply by letting a trainee practise on you. Some independent salons advertise for 'models' (often by notices in the shop window). Sessions are often in the evening. At the Toni &amp; Guy Academies, these appointments cost \u00a35. Others charge nothing. </p> <p> \u0095 When you need a pick-me-up, there's nothing more satisfying than a makeover. Try a visit to a department store where most brands have beauty consultants on hand happy to give a free demonstration. There is occasionally a small charge for their time, but this is often redeemable against the sale of the cosmetics used. </p> <p> \u0095 Beauty schools offer cut-price or free treatments to people willing to have the work carried out by students. But it is important to make sure the school is affiliated to one of the the following examining boards: Abtac, City &amp; Guilds, Itec or Cidesco. </p> <p> \u0095 If you are determined to have cosmetic surgery, but can't afford the prices in this country, you could have treatment abroad. Eastern European medical groups offer operations for up to a third less than their UK equivalents. For example, Europol Cosmetic Surgery, which operates in Poland, charges \u00a32,300 for breast enlargement, \u00a32,600 for a facelift and \u00a32,200 for a nose job. Prices include travel and accommodation.</p> <p><strong>Play your cards right</strong></p> <p>Maintaining your body may make you feel good, but it won't improve your bank balance. </p> <p>Unless you have the wealth to match Joyce Wildenstein (below), it's cheapest to pay by credit card.

      "bodyText": "Beauty salons and hairdressers have traditionally been viewed as the territory of the woman with time on her hands, the lady who lunches. But over the past few years, increasing numbers of women have started regarding professional hair and beauty care as an essential part of their working and social lives. Andrew Clark, creative director of Nicky Clarke's hair salon in Mayfair, says it is not unusual to find executive women coming into the salon for a blow-dry every morning as part of their daily routine. 'They've usually got their mobile telephones plugged into their ears, and it's just a part of their job to look good,' he says. A quick look at the Nicky Clarke price list shows that their salaries or business expense accounts must be impressive. An appointment with one of the salon's lesser-known stylists can costs from \u00a345, depending on their experience at the salon. But an initial appointment with the man himself - and you may have to wait up to three weeks for a time of his choice - will cost you \u00a3300. A fast-track appointment (which limits the wait to two or three days) is \u00a3500. The average client spends around \u00a3180 a visit. Most women teach themselves to apply makeup, but many now have a 'makeover' from a professional makeup artist. Ariane Poole, an independent consultant and makeup adviser for Boots No 7, has clients who book in twice a year for a complete assessment. A lesson with her normally lasts between two and three hours, and costs \u00a3250. Poole goes through your makeup bag, discusses the look you want, and sorts out makeup for days and evenings. Her clients range from housewives to high-flying professionals. Beauty salons are cheaper, about \u00a320 for a 45-minute 'cleanse and makeup' session, or \u00a335 for a complete makeup 'lesson' lasting an hour. Bridal makeup costs slightly more, at \u00a345, but includes a practice session as well as application for the big day itself. Manicures are also becoming more mainstream. The concept of the nail bar- a manicure salon which you can walk into without an appointment and get your nails done at a reasonably low price - has finally crossed the Atlantic to the UK high street. A basic salon manicure costs about \u00a315 and takes up to 45 minutes; a nail bar will turn you round in 15 minutes for \u00a310. Branches of the New York Nail Company and Nails Inc are sprouting up in London. Boots is set to start a walk-in manicure service in major stores this month. Hair today, gone tomorrow - for \u00a31,000 Hair removal - one of the cheapest beauty processes if you use a razor and soap - becomes the most expensive if you have laser treatment. At the Laser Clinic in London's Harley Street, denuding an upper lip costs about \u00a3100 a session. A bikini line will cost between \u00a3250 and \u00a3400, while a full leg costs from \u00a3600 to \u00a3900. Success depends on zapping the hair follicles while they are growing, so you may need up to six sessions to remove all your unwanted fuzz. One women recently spent \u00a31,000 having her upper lip, armpits, bikini line and lower legs lasered - and she faces five more treatments.The effects are meant to be permanent, but hormonal changes such as the menopause may bring new hair. The process is very quick and relatively painless. Your skin is chilled before being exposed to a laser beam, which is as uncomfortable as someone pinging elastic bands against your skin. A session normally takes between half an hour and an hour. Afterwards the skin becomes quite tender and blotchy - side-effects that can last from half an hour to two weeks. In contrast, waxing hurts - don't let any beautician tell you otherwise - but it is much cheaper: about \u00a314 for lower legs, and \u00a38 for a bikini line and underarms. It has to be repeated every six weeks if you want to remain hair-free. Having your lower legs professionally waxed from the age of 30 to 60 would cost more than \u00a33,600. Likewise, electrolysis can be uncomfortable, leaving little red burn marks if the current is not applied properly. It costs about \u00a310 per 10- or 15- minute session. These have to be repeated many times, and even then the hair may not be killed. Beauty on a budget If you are prepared to compromise, there are many ways of achieving good results at little cost: \u0095 Get your hair done cheaply by letting a trainee practise on you. Some independent salons advertise for 'models' (often by notices in the shop window). Sessions are often in the evening. At the Toni &amp; Guy Academies, these appointments cost \u00a35. Others charge nothing. \u0095 When you need a pick-me-up, there's nothing more satisfying than a makeover. Try a visit to a department store where most brands have beauty consultants on hand happy to give a free demonstration. There is occasionally a small charge for their time, but this is often redeemable against the sale of the cosmetics used. \u0095 Beauty schools offer cut-price or free treatments to people willing to have the work carried out by students. But it is important to make sure the school is affiliated to one of the the following examining boards: Abtac, City &amp; Guilds, Itec or Cidesco. \u0095 If you are determined to have cosmetic surgery, but can't afford the prices in this country, you could have treatment abroad. Eastern European medical groups offer operations for up to a third less than their UK equivalents. For example, Europol Cosmetic Surgery, which operates in Poland, charges \u00a32,300 for breast enlargement, \u00a32,600 for a facelift and \u00a32,200 for a nose job. Prices include travel and accommodation. Play your cards right Maintaining your body may make you feel good, but it won't improve your bank balance. Unless you have the wealth to match Joyce Wildenstein (below), it's cheapest to pay by credit card. Capital One (0800 952 5355) charges an annual percentage rate (APR) of 3.9 per cent, rising to 12.9 per cent after six months. The Nationwide (0500 302011) charges 3.5 per cent, rising to 14.6 per cent after six months. If you prefer to repay debt over a longer period and don't mind paying more in interest, the Egg Visa (www.egg.com) charges 10.9 per cent indefinitely. Do not accept any invitations to take out a store credit card unless you are prepared either to pay off the bill in full each month or pay through the nose for your credit. Harvey Nichols charges 26.5 per cent APR, Selfridges 27.6 per cent and Harrods 28.9 per cent. If you want to borrow a large amount for major cosmetic surgery, you may have to consider a personal loan. For amounts between \u00a33,000 and \u00a35,000, the cheapest lenders are Smile (www.smile.co.uk) and Chartered Trust (0800 068 2286), which charge 12.9 per cent APR. For between \u00a35,000 and \u00a37,499, the Tesco bank (0845 6006016) is cheapest, at 10.2 per cent.",

Sample 2 Memo '[Name of employer] strives to ensure the comfort and safety of staff and visitors by encouraging a smoke-free and fragrance-free environment.' Sample 3 Policy 'Given that chemically sensitive individuals may react to different products with widely varying degrees of severity, it is very difficult to ensure a consistently comfortable and accommodating work environment under every conceivable set of circumstances. Even so, it is the general consensus of the Labour/Management Committee and the desire of the [company name] to minimise to the extent possible the barriers and difficulties experienced in the workplace by both employees and clients subject to chemical/ fragrance sensitivities... The [company name] requests that all offices and work spaces used by staff and their visitors remain free of chemical-based scented products.' Sample 4 Memo 'I ask that we refrain from applying spray colognes, hairsprays and/or air fresheners in the office, as the use of such products may trigger allergic reactions and create health problems.' Sample 5 Policy 'Employees working in patient care areas and in non-patient care areas shall not wear cologne, perfume, aftershave lotions, scented lotions or body washes in the medical centre.' \u0095 Source: Job Accommodation Network",

However, it has opened up a marvellous avenue of opportunity for the Media Diary in terms of others among Fleet Street's finest who may consider going down the same route. With the heated rivalry between the Mirror and the Sun, obviously there would be a Mirror editor's game - Piers Morgan's Monopoly, featuring the 'go to jail do not pass go and do not collect your share dividends' card, drawn from Tina Weaver's Community Chest. The Sunday Times Dream Date game - whereby contestants use a toy phone to be connected to their 'dream date' - or rather find themselves put through to the local tax office where details of a Labour Peer's tax returns are disseminated. And of course the highly popular Charles Moore's Consequences, where contestants fill page three of the Telegraph with unlikely and lurid scenarios involving vicars, labradors, scouts, acts of marital revenge and cross-dressing. </p> <p><strong> Bad tip from the top</strong><br> You may remember, may even have bought, the heavily advertised Sunday Times last week with its promise to 'guide you through the investment jungle of the internet'.

      "bodyText": "Fleet Street is all just a board game We cannot believe that David Yelland is really going to 'personally endorse' his own board game, Editor!, as this would move merchandising beyond parody, with only a handful of media hacks actually knowing who the Sun's current editor is. However, it has opened up a marvellous avenue of opportunity for the Media Diary in terms of others among Fleet Street's finest who may consider going down the same route. With the heated rivalry between the Mirror and the Sun, obviously there would be a Mirror editor's game - Piers Morgan's Monopoly, featuring the 'go to jail do not pass go and do not collect your share dividends' card, drawn from Tina Weaver's Community Chest. The Sunday Times Dream Date game - whereby contestants use a toy phone to be connected to their 'dream date' - or rather find themselves put through to the local tax office where details of a Labour Peer's tax returns are disseminated. And of course the highly popular Charles Moore's Consequences, where contestants fill page three of the Telegraph with unlikely and lurid scenarios involving vicars, labradors, scouts, acts of marital revenge and cross-dressing. Bad tip from the top You may remember, may even have bought, the heavily advertised Sunday Times last week with its promise to 'guide you through the investment jungle of the internet'. The newspaper went where many of the rest of us would fear to tread by printing a list of what it assessed to be the best internet and 'new economy' companies to invest in.

On its City pages, this features its shares 'worst tip': Freecom.net in, yes you've guessed, the Sunday Times, which over a three-month period plummeted 76.59 per cent from the point the paper had tipped it. From the republican stable Many congratulations to Simon Walker, director of communications at British Airways, who has been installed as the next communications secretary at Buck House, doing her maj's press releases and spinning all those damning stories about corgis and picture curators. In keeping with the tradition, Walker's salary will be paid by BA for the duration of his post - which will be interesting given that BA's new chief executive, Rod Eddington, is from the land of Oz and, indeed, the House of Murdoch, both of which err on the side of republicanism.

Once, video-game designers were lampooned as unsociable anoraks who liked nothing better than sitting in crepuscular lofts writing lines of code. But now they are being feted as the Spielbergs of tomorrow, purveyors of electronically induced emotions to a discerning public desperate to spend billions of pounds on their gaming fix. </p> <p>Worth nearly \u00a31.8 billion a year, the video-games software market in the UK is already 1.8 times the size of the video rental industry, according to the European Leisure Software Publishers Association. </p> <p>Analysts predict that the market is set to grow exponentially as the arrival of new technology starts to blur the barriers between films and video games, broadening the medium's appeal beyond the teenage market. </p> <p>'You'll start to see episodic games, which change from week to week,' said Nick Gibson, games analyst with investment bank Durlacher. 'I'm sure the games manufacturers will start to borrow from the world of television.' Gibson predicts that the industry is about to enter a golden age, thanks largely to the introduction of new platforms such as Sony's PlayStation II and Microsoft's Xbox. </p> <p>'These machines provide a fantastic new level of audiovisual experience, similar to TV,' says David Gardner, managing director of Electronic Arts Europe, the largest games manufacturer. 'This is the Holy Grail. We'll now be able to deliver what we have been promising.' </p> <p>Analysts at Datamonitor predict that the global games-software market will be worth $11 billion (\u00a37bn) this year. By 2003 it will be worth more than $17bn. Factor in the potential size of the interactive TV, internet and mobile-phone markets and it is easy to start predicting an industry worth $30bn in less than five years. </p> <p>Gardner believes that the new technologies will combine to make the market grow exponentially. 'You may be playing online, then you'll go out with your mobile phone. You might get a message telling you that one of your characters is under attack. So you could type a couple of instructions and then when you get home start playing through your set-top box.' </p> <p>He argues that the internet will provide a huge boost to the games industry, not just by offering a new method of distribution - some years off in his view - but in the way games can be promoted online. 'Record companies have the radio to promote their products; we'll have the internet,' Gardner says. </p> <p>The internet will, Gardner believes, be a crucial driver in giving video games mass market appeal. But a lot of the groundwork for this has already been laid. Analysts point out that Sony's PlayStation opened up games to an older, more affluent market. </p> <p>'Sony is a company that has huge marketing experience,' says Frederic Diot, senior analyst with Datamon itor. 'It was able to sell the idea of playing games. It used to have a geeky image but now it's cool to play. The industry has come out of the niche it was in five years ago. If you can create the right type of games, you can now appeal to anyone.' </p> <p>But the costs of producing and marketing games are soaring, too. A couple of years ago a game would typically cost between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3400,000 to develop. But these days, it is not unusual for a game to cost more than \u00a31 million to bring to market. Some games - such as Sega's martial-arts epic Shenmue, due for launch this November - cost a staggering $20m to develop and market. In addition, many games are based on films - such as Infogrames' Mission Impossible - or are branded around sports stars, which means huge licensing fees. </p> <p>As a result of this inflation the video-games industry is rapidly consolidating, as companies look to cut marketing and distribution costs. 'The biggest publishers are going to Hoover up the smaller publishers. The industry is very acquisitive,' Gibson says. </p> <p>Currently Eidos, the UK firm behind the Tomb Raider series of games and valued at more than \u00a3500m, is the target of bid speculation. Infogrames, Electronic Arts and Vivendi subsidiary Havas have all been linked with the company. Eidos itself expanded by buying up small software houses and rebadging them. </p> <p>But even if a bidder does not emerge for Eidos now, it is unlikely the company will retain its independence for long. It was forced into issuing two profit warnings in March when it became apparent that it was unable to shift as many games as it believed it could. Eidos's share price slumped by 40 per cent as a result. </p> <p>Other companies are also finding the going tough. Infogrames picked up GT Interactive, which had been struggling for survival, while former software giant Acclaim is also in the doldrums. </p> <p>'There are too many games coming out for the number of machines,' says Gardner. 'As a result there's some natural consolidation going on.' </p> <p>One of the factors driving the current round of consolidation is consumer anticipation. As gamers wait for the launches of the new PlayStation and Xbox, they stop buying games made for the current consoles. This has allowed Sega to carve out market share for its Dreamcast model, although most analysts believe PlayStation II will prove the real winner in the long term. </p> <p>'The games publishers are susceptible to the rhythms of the market. They are experiencing far more difficult trading conditions than they were when the market was at its apex a couple of years ago,' says Gibson. </p> <p>Diot predicts more consolidation to come among the industry's 20 largest firms. 'In two or three years' time we will probably be only talking about five companies, who will control 60 per cent of the industry.' </p> <p>Only the biggest companies can now afford to take the hit that comes when a game fails to sell. 'It's as expensive as video production,' says Gardner. 'And so the industry has the same dynamic as the film industry. Our top 10 games pay for our bottom 10 games.' </p> <p>The implication is clear. Smaller companies can be wiped out if one of their games is a turkey. UK firm Gremlin, for example, which was eventually acquired by Infogrames, saw its share price collapse when a couple of its games failed to take off. </p> <p>Roy Campbell, managing director of Infogrames UK, argues that further consolidation is vital if the industry is to have a wider appeal. 'We've got to drive the prices down,' he says. 'We have to get our products into the mass market, into places like grocery outlets, so that games can become impulse purchases.' </p> <p>Games aficionados may blanch at this view, but Campbell says the games market can no longer be treated as a collection of cottage industries. 'The industry is not a charity case any more. Ten years ago it used to be run by hobbyists. But now it's Hollywood. Everyone is accountable. There are no hiding places.'

Beware geeks bearing new games consoles When Sony launched its PlayStation II in Japan earlier this year, there was near rioting as shoppers scrambled to buy it. When the console is launched in Britain in the autumn, consumers will have to order in advance, because the company does not expect to be able to cope with demand. The short history of the video games market is littered with examples of how the introduction of new technology creates seismic shifts in the industry. In the Seventies the market was dominated by two US companies, Atari and Mattel, which both started out by making arcade games. But as Nick Gibson, analyst with Durlacher, noted in a recent report: 'The status quo changed in 1985 when Nintendo released its 8-bit Famicom console, and Sega released its Sega Master System in 1987.' The two Japanese firms managed to see off the threat from their US rivals with the subsequent launch of 16-bit consoles, which were technically far superior, cheaper, and were able to offer consumers a wide choice of games. But by 1994 the market was depressed as consumers waited for the launch of 32- and 64-bit games. Sony subsequently stole a lead with the launch of the original PlayStation, which has sold 75 million consoles worldwide. Frederic Diot, senior analyst with Datamonitor, said: 'Nintendo has become complacent. And they've annoyed a lot of people in the industry. The Nintendo 64 has a high royalty charge, which has stopped a lot of people writing games for it. Sony's charge is much lower.'

      "body": "<p>How much are you prepared to spend on looking good? A fiver on a new mascara or lipstick? Twenty pounds on a moisturiser that will smooth out your wrinkles? Or \u00a34,000 on a face lift to look a decade younger? </p> <p>Sandra, a 55-year-old who works as a personal assistant in London, spent \u00a33,500 on having the bridge of her nose shaved last autumn. 'I was staying in the US with friends who were crazy about cosmetic surgery. They'd all had something done, and encouraged me to see a surgeon about my nose. I was self-conscious about it - it was really big - and I've felt like that for most of my life.' </p> <p>Delighted with her new, slim nose, Sandra now says she would consider further surgery. And she's not alone: demand for beauty treatments, both surgical and non-surgical, is soaring. According to market research company Verdict, Britons spent \u00a3634 million on cosmetics in 1999, a rise of 29.2 per cent since 1995, and \u00a31,035m on skincare products, up 30.6 per cent over the same period. Fellow researcher Mintel, which has also delved into the facial skincare market, believes this is partly due to an increase in women over 40 who are prepared to spend more on expensive anti-ageing products, and partly because women now represent half the working population, have more disposable income and feel justified in spending it on skincare products and makeup so as to look good at work. </p> <p>Cosmetic surgery specialists are reporting even bigger increases in business. The Harley Medical Group, one of the UK's biggest providers of cosmetic surgery, has seen a 32 per cent increase in operations year on year since last May. </p> <p>Peter Coles, medical director at the Harley Medical Group, attributes the dramatic increase to the positive economy leading to greater affluence among potential patients, and the Millennium effect. 'Patients fall into two groups - those born with a genetic defect, and those who want surgery because of ageing . The latter group, who are older and have more disposable income, regarded the Millennium as a good time to have a face lift or a tummy tuck.' </p> <p>But perhaps the biggest influence is a changed attitude to cosmetic surgery. Ten years ago, it was considered a luxury that only the rich and famous could afford. Now, says Coles, everyone goes in for it, and the ultimate goal is different. In many cases the problem is as much psychological as physical. 'Cosmetic surgery is not about looking mega-glamorous or having oodles of money to spend on yourself. The main emphasis is on looking normal, trying to remedy the problem that a patient perceives makes him or her look abnormal.' </p> <p>Despite recent research indicating that men suffer from delusions that their physiques are better than they really are, increasing numbers of men are opting for cosmetic surgery. At the Pountney Clinic in West London, 25 per cent of the patients are men, while at the Harley Medical Group 40 per cent are men (compared with 5 per cent a decade ago). </p> <p>And a quarter of these men are opting for penis extension operations, even though such operations have no effect on the performance or size of the erect penis. </p> <p>'It's not usually the partner that's demand ing an increase in size,' says Coles. 'It's often young men in their twenties feeling inhibited about undressing in front of friends because they fear being ridiculed for the size of their penis. Such concerns take over patients' whole lives, even if they realise it is absurd. If you can break the psychological circle, you often have very happy patients.' </p> <p>Cary Cooper, professor of occupational psychology and health at the University of Manchester Institute of Sci ence and Technology, says some people focus a desire to change their lives on their bodies. If only they could change their ears, nose, face or bottom, they would find it easier to make friends, get the job they want or find a lover. </p> <p>'It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy,' says Cooper. 'If they have a treatment and it gives them confidence, they may be able to achieve the things they want. But in some cases it may prove a short-term solution, and ultimately they will have to tackle the deeper problem.' </p> <p>Although the cost runs into thousands of pounds per operation (see table, page 5), patients are not just settling for one treatment. </p> <p>In the US the average patient returns for seven procedures, and Coles says UK patients are showing similar tendencies. 'They may start off with a breast augmentation in their twenties, then when they start getting wrinkles they might consider laser treatment or collagen injections. Then, in their fifties, they may go for a facelift.' </p> <p><strong>Bill for beauty: \u00a38,000 a year</strong></p> <p>Like many women, Suzannah argues that spending money on beauty treatments and haircare is necessary to maintain her confidence. </p> <p>Her husband, James, is a successful businessman who is increasingly involved in local politics. Corporate entertainment plays an important part in his career. As his hostess, Suzannah, who is 33, insists that looking good is absolutely vital and is seen as 'part of the job'. </p> <p>Being a full-time mother to two small children in the country doesn't afford her the time to be as well groomed as she would like but, ideally, she would visit the hairdresser for a cut and colour once a month, at \u00a370, and would pay \u00a312 for a blow-dry and styling before any important function, up to three times a week. She also likes weekly trips to the beauty salon for a manicure (\u00a316), a facial (\u00a340) and a relaxing massage (\u00a327). </p> <p>Fortnightly appointments are needed for pedicures (\u00a320 a time), a fake-tanning session (\u00a332) and eyebrow shaping (\u00a35.50), with leg, bikini line and underarm waxing (\u00a320). Her average annual expenditure on professional hair and beauty care is a staggering \u00a38,196. </p> <p>'It's all about being part of a team,' she says. 'If I look and feel good, I have the confidence to talk to people. It's a case of presenting a good image, which gives my husband extra credibility.'</p> <p><strong>Implant of confidence</strong></p> <p>Gill Walker decided cosmetic surgery would boost her confidence enough for her to look for a new job after the death of her husband three years ago. </p> <p>Gill, 49, started by having collagen injections to fill out a few lines around her mouth and eyes. These worked well, recovery was instant and there was no need for an anaesthetic. But the effect only lasted for about three months, so she started having repeat treatments. </p> <p>After a while, her nurse offered Gill Cooltouch laser treatment for her wrinkles free of charge, in return for having the process filmed for a television programme. This worked differently, gradually filling out the lines during the month following the treatment. Again the effects wore off. </p> <p>Now she has opted for a permanent solution - soft implants looking like tiny tubes are pushed in along the line of the wrinkle. 'I had stitches, but there was no real puffiness. And you can have the implants taken out if you decide you don't like them.

      "bodyText": "How much are you prepared to spend on looking good? A fiver on a new mascara or lipstick? Twenty pounds on a moisturiser that will smooth out your wrinkles? Or \u00a34,000 on a face lift to look a decade younger? Sandra, a 55-year-old who works as a personal assistant in London, spent \u00a33,500 on having the bridge of her nose shaved last autumn. 'I was staying in the US with friends who were crazy about cosmetic surgery. They'd all had something done, and encouraged me to see a surgeon about my nose. I was self-conscious about it - it was really big - and I've felt like that for most of my life.' Delighted with her new, slim nose, Sandra now says she would consider further surgery. And she's not alone: demand for beauty treatments, both surgical and non-surgical, is soaring. According to market research company Verdict, Britons spent \u00a3634 million on cosmetics in 1999, a rise of 29.2 per cent since 1995, and \u00a31,035m on skincare products, up 30.6 per cent over the same period. Fellow researcher Mintel, which has also delved into the facial skincare market, believes this is partly due to an increase in women over 40 who are prepared to spend more on expensive anti-ageing products, and partly because women now represent half the working population, have more disposable income and feel justified in spending it on skincare products and makeup so as to look good at work. Cosmetic surgery specialists are reporting even bigger increases in business. The Harley Medical Group, one of the UK's biggest providers of cosmetic surgery, has seen a 32 per cent increase in operations year on year since last May. Peter Coles, medical director at the Harley Medical Group, attributes the dramatic increase to the positive economy leading to greater affluence among potential patients, and the Millennium effect. 'Patients fall into two groups - those born with a genetic defect, and those who want surgery because of ageing . The latter group, who are older and have more disposable income, regarded the Millennium as a good time to have a face lift or a tummy tuck.' But perhaps the biggest influence is a changed attitude to cosmetic surgery. Ten years ago, it was considered a luxury that only the rich and famous could afford. Now, says Coles, everyone goes in for it, and the ultimate goal is different. In many cases the problem is as much psychological as physical. 'Cosmetic surgery is not about looking mega-glamorous or having oodles of money to spend on yourself. The main emphasis is on looking normal, trying to remedy the problem that a patient perceives makes him or her look abnormal.' Despite recent research indicating that men suffer from delusions that their physiques are better than they really are, increasing numbers of men are opting for cosmetic surgery. At the Pountney Clinic in West London, 25 per cent of the patients are men, while at the Harley Medical Group 40 per cent are men (compared with 5 per cent a decade ago). And a quarter of these men are opting for penis extension operations, even though such operations have no effect on the performance or size of the erect penis. 'It's not usually the partner that's demand ing an increase in size,' says Coles. 'It's often young men in their twenties feeling inhibited about undressing in front of friends because they fear being ridiculed for the size of their penis. Such concerns take over patients' whole lives, even if they realise it is absurd. If you can break the psychological circle, you often have very happy patients.' Cary Cooper, professor of occupational psychology and health at the University of Manchester Institute of Sci ence and Technology, says some people focus a desire to change their lives on their bodies. If only they could change their ears, nose, face or bottom, they would find it easier to make friends, get the job they want or find a lover. 'It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy,' says Cooper. 'If they have a treatment and it gives them confidence, they may be able to achieve the things they want. But in some cases it may prove a short-term solution, and ultimately they will have to tackle the deeper problem.' Although the cost runs into thousands of pounds per operation (see table, page 5), patients are not just settling for one treatment. In the US the average patient returns for seven procedures, and Coles says UK patients are showing similar tendencies. 'They may start off with a breast augmentation in their twenties, then when they start getting wrinkles they might consider laser treatment or collagen injections. Then, in their fifties, they may go for a facelift.' Bill for beauty: \u00a38,000 a year Like many women, Suzannah argues that spending money on beauty treatments and haircare is necessary to maintain her confidence. Her husband, James, is a successful businessman who is increasingly involved in local politics. Corporate entertainment plays an important part in his career. As his hostess, Suzannah, who is 33, insists that looking good is absolutely vital and is seen as 'part of the job'. Being a full-time mother to two small children in the country doesn't afford her the time to be as well groomed as she would like but, ideally, she would visit the hairdresser for a cut and colour once a month, at \u00a370, and would pay \u00a312 for a blow-dry and styling before any important function, up to three times a week. She also likes weekly trips to the beauty salon for a manicure (\u00a316), a facial (\u00a340) and a relaxing massage (\u00a327). Fortnightly appointments are needed for pedicures (\u00a320 a time), a fake-tanning session (\u00a332) and eyebrow shaping (\u00a35.50), with leg, bikini line and underarm waxing (\u00a320). Her average annual expenditure on professional hair and beauty care is a staggering \u00a38,196. 'It's all about being part of a team,' she says. 'If I look and feel good, I have the confidence to talk to people. It's a case of presenting a good image, which gives my husband extra credibility.' Implant of confidence Gill Walker decided cosmetic surgery would boost her confidence enough for her to look for a new job after the death of her husband three years ago. Gill, 49, started by having collagen injections to fill out a few lines around her mouth and eyes. These worked well, recovery was instant and there was no need for an anaesthetic. But the effect only lasted for about three months, so she started having repeat treatments. After a while, her nurse offered Gill Cooltouch laser treatment for her wrinkles free of charge, in return for having the process filmed for a television programme. This worked differently, gradually filling out the lines during the month following the treatment. Again the effects wore off. Now she has opted for a permanent solution - soft implants looking like tiny tubes are pushed in along the line of the wrinkle. 'I had stitches, but there was no real puffiness. And you can have the implants taken out if you decide you don't like them. It probably means I don't have to go back for collagen, but I do anyway,' she says. Gill acknowledges that other people probably think the treatments have made little perceptible difference to the way she looks. 'It does make a fractional difference to my face, but it makes a tremendous difference to the way I feel about myself. The thing is not to expect to look entirely different. It's not like a facelift where you lose 10 years, and you do have to have top-ups. But once you've seen what it can do for you, you become hooked.' And has it helped her to find a job? 'Not yet,' she says. Smile - you're worth it When it comes to first impressions, your mouth can be a huge asset or your greatest liability. Recent research in the US shows that the first thing 63 per cent of people notice when meeting someone is their teeth and their smile. Dr Phil Stemmer, dentist to celebrities such as Patsy Kensit, Liam Gallagher and All Saints, has seen a 60 per cent increase in the number of people wanting private cosmetic dentistry to improve their smiles during the past two years. Treatments range from bleaching to whiten the teeth, closing gaps and replacing old amalgam fillings with the modern white versions, to crowns, porcelain veneers and titanium implants to form the root for a crown to replace a missing tooth. Although some of the treatments do cost thousands of pounds - one recent patient, a market trader, spent \u00a317,000 correcting his teeth - many cost a few hundred. The results can be priceless. 'We've had people who've phoned us up after treatment to say they've found themselves new boy- or girlfriends and new jobs,' says Stemmer. It can be a tremendous confidence booster.' However, the basis for all dentistry has to be a healthy mouth. He refuses to treat patients until they have cured any gum disease that could result in complications: 'There's no point in putting a diamond in a sea of disease. We recommend that affected patients visit a dental hygienist, floss, brush their teeth and use an alcohol-free mouthwash.'",

      "body": "<p><strong> Intelligence: New British Art 2000</strong> Tate Britain, London SW1, 24 September </p> <p>It's the largest show ever put on by the Tate. <strong> Intelligence</strong> is bigger than C\u00e9zanne, bigger than Jackson Pollock, even bigger than the show that precedes it, which united Turner, Ruskin and the full pre-Raphaelite team in a gridlock of crowded galleries. It is also the first in a series of triennial shows at Tate Britain, surveys of the newest and best that might put the event on a par with the much-attended Whitney Biennial in New York. </p> <p>If all this makes you rub your hands in anticipation, like a cineaste at the start of a festival, bear in mind that there are only 22 artists on show: the rest is pristine white space. </p> <p>Not that this is just any old space. Intelligence has been designed by Adam Caruso of St John Caruso, architects of the stunning New Art Gallery in Walsall. Caruso has transformed several acres of the Tate into a minimalist variation on the old beaux-arts museum, where all the rooms emerge from a lofty central hall so that nobody ever gets lost. </p> <p>There are no dark mazes, no bottlenecks, no confusion of sound bleeding from one video-room to the next. Gillian Wearing's film is shown in a comfortable arthouse cinema; the stench of Sarah Lucas's scorched cars is dispersed in a gallery as big as a ballpark. From the cushy sofas to the flowers in the foyer, arranged by the WI, everything is calculated to put the visitor at ease, to soften the ordeal of contemporary art. </p> <p>This turns out to be entirely consistent with the mission of the show itself. The curators of Intelligence are eager to include each and every visitor in the business of art. They believe in mutual dialogues, equal partnerships and so forth between the artists and their public. Although this doesn't extend to a halfway literate essay in the catalogue, it is a more than honourable aim. The curators don't want us to stand about passively absorbing the shock of the new, they want to encourage active viewers. </p> <p>Julian Opie makes a feature of your very presence by turning the first room into a full-scale pastiche of a gallery. The walls are hung with generic pictures - a portrait, a still life, a reclining nude - generated by computer and reproduced in vinyl on metal billboards. Toy spectators are posted about the room, making the didactic point that no show is complete without its audience, an idea more subtly reprised in Mark Lewis's video eulogy to the 'silent proletariat' of overlooked bystanders who complete the cast in so many movies. </p> <p>Alan Johnston invites you to project your own images into the ghostly frames he has sketched on the walls, a gambit rather less witty than the original Seventies text piece, 'Is it possible for me to do nothing as my contribution to this show?' Bob and Roberta Smith - aka Patrick Brill - hand the pencil directly to you. Every week, Brill will choose from among your slogans, painting his favourites on Caruso's white walls. As an incentive, he has supplied a few of his own - 'Eat British Meat', 'Peas are the New Beans' - presumably on the basis that every passing child could do better. </p> <p>This is the snag with Intelligence: the title is such a hostage to fortune that you can't help wondering whether some of the art amounts to a facetious response. Hilary Lloyd's video, for example, shows a grown woman struggling like Sisyphus to erect a house of cards. Douglas Gordon lists the names of everyone he can remember meeting so far, an essay, he alleges, on the nature of memory. But is Gordon's memory good or bad? He's the only one who knows or cares. </p> <p>All group shows have their bald patches, generally when the art has been tailored to fit the curatorial values or vice versa. The best work here has nothing to with equal partnerships, information gathering or the artist as secret agent, one of the more ludicrous notions in the catalogue. It is simply intelligent in its own right. </p> <p>Graham Gussin has bought some dry ice, released it in a disused warehouse and filmed its gradual dispersal on shadowy black-and-white stock. The vapour steals through the building like the fog in Dickens's Bleak House , ebbing through the abandoned rooms, unfurling down the staircase. Sometimes it looks as still as the white mists in Romantic painting; then it continues to haunt the place with its presence. The transition between art and fiction, between framed image and fluid narrative, has been beautifully choreographed. </p> <p>If you missed Susan Hiller's Witness, installed in a derelict London chapel last month, you have another chance to experience this mysterious event at Tate Britain. Based on first-hand accounts of inexplicable sightings that Hiller has recorded over the years, relayed through a hanging garden of tiny speakers, the piece gradually comes to feel like a phenomenal visitation in itself. </p> <p>Gillian Wearing's film is also based on an eyewitness account, in this case her own encounter with a street drunk in south London. Wearing filmed this handsome woman talking with all the theatrical dignity of a stage star. You see this footage in grainy slo-mo, out of sequence with the sound of her voice describing the recent death of her twin sister from alcohol. It only becomes apparent at the end of the film that sound and vision are more profoundly divided. The voice belongs to the surviving twin: the woman you were watching is no longer alive. </p> <p>Wearing has never made a better or more affecting film. Indeed, Intelligence includes some of the best work yet from several of these artists. There is a larger quota of duds and duffers, of course, but it doesn't begin to reach the sensational proportions you get at the Whitney Biennial. The Tate's first triennial is not a bit controversial in this or any other respect and it is all the better for it.</p>",

The walls are hung with generic pictures - a portrait, a still life, a reclining nude - generated by computer and reproduced in vinyl on metal billboards. Toy spectators are posted about the room, making the didactic point that no show is complete without its audience, an idea more subtly reprised in Mark Lewis's video eulogy to the 'silent proletariat' of overlooked bystanders who complete the cast in so many movies. Alan Johnston invites you to project your own images into the ghostly frames he has sketched on the walls, a gambit rather less witty than the original Seventies text piece, 'Is it possible for me to do nothing as my contribution to this show?' Bob and Roberta Smith - aka Patrick Brill - hand the pencil directly to you. Every week, Brill will choose from among your slogans, painting his favourites on Caruso's white walls. As an incentive, he has supplied a few of his own - 'Eat British Meat', 'Peas are the New Beans' - presumably on the basis that every passing child could do better. This is the snag with Intelligence: the title is such a hostage to fortune that you can't help wondering whether some of the art amounts to a facetious response. Hilary Lloyd's video, for example, shows a grown woman struggling like Sisyphus to erect a house of cards. Douglas Gordon lists the names of everyone he can remember meeting so far, an essay, he alleges, on the nature of memory. But is Gordon's memory good or bad? He's the only one who knows or cares. All group shows have their bald patches, generally when the art has been tailored to fit the curatorial values or vice versa. The best work here has nothing to with equal partnerships, information gathering or the artist as secret agent, one of the more ludicrous notions in the catalogue. It is simply intelligent in its own right. Graham Gussin has bought some dry ice, released it in a disused warehouse and filmed its gradual dispersal on shadowy black-and-white stock. The vapour steals through the building like the fog in Dickens's Bleak House , ebbing through the abandoned rooms, unfurling down the staircase. Sometimes it looks as still as the white mists in Romantic painting; then it continues to haunt the place with its presence. The transition between art and fiction, between framed image and fluid narrative, has been beautifully choreographed. If you missed Susan Hiller's Witness, installed in a derelict London chapel last month, you have another chance to experience this mysterious event at Tate Britain. Based on first-hand accounts of inexplicable sightings that Hiller has recorded over the years, relayed through a hanging garden of tiny speakers, the piece gradually comes to feel like a phenomenal visitation in itself. Gillian Wearing's film is also based on an eyewitness account, in this case her own encounter with a street drunk in south London. Wearing filmed this handsome woman talking with all the theatrical dignity of a stage star. You see this footage in grainy slo-mo, out of sequence with the sound of her voice describing the recent death of her twin sister from alcohol. It only becomes apparent at the end of the film that sound and vision are more profoundly divided. The voice belongs to the surviving twin: the woman you were watching is no longer alive. Wearing has never made a better or more affecting film. Indeed, Intelligence includes some of the best work yet from several of these artists. There is a larger quota of duds and duffers, of course, but it doesn't begin to reach the sensational proportions you get at the Whitney Biennial. The Tate's first triennial is not a bit controversial in this or any other respect and it is all the better for it.",

The supposed conflict is between good people who know no fear and bad people who have no qualms. </p> <p>There are numerous scenes and devices borrowed from earlier pictures other than Notorious .

      "body": "<p>The city of London's planning committee vote last Tuesday to approve a new tower designed by Norman Foster on the site of the Baltic Exchange would have been inconceivable a decade ago. We used to believe that though skyscrapers might initially seem seductive in a flashy, obvious kind of way, like fast food or gas -guzzling Cadillacs, they were actually a thoroughly bad thing. </p> <p>By dumbing down the skyline, they made for characterless cities that could be anywhere, a dim echo of a distant American original. They were about cultural imperialism, environmental profligacy and corporate sterility. Yet we loved them, just as we love burgers and the chrome-plated products of the golden age of Detroit. </p> <p>But in the 1980s, we were too po-faced to admit it. The very same planning committee that has just said yes to Foster's tower was immovable in its opposition to Peter Palumbo's plans to build a very much more modestly scaled tower designed by Mies van der Rohe for Mansion House Square. It became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre , a last chance to save the Square Mile from the relentless tide of new development. </p> <p>Now the opposite attitude is emerging. After a quarter of a century in which high-rise architecture was completely off the agenda, we have embarked on an unprecedented bout of skyscraper building. Cities determined to make their mark have decided that a crop of new towers, preferably as exhibitionistic as possible, is the way to get noticed. In urban-renewal projects, a conspicuous high rise is now regarded as one of the most effective ways to make the middle of nowhere feel like somewhere. Liverpool, which is desperate to shake off its image as one of the great urban losers, has plans for a major clump of high rises designed by slick Americans Kohn Pedersen Fox that would transform the traditional views of its waterfront. Manchester and Birmingham have equally ambitious plans. But it is in London that the turnaround is most remarkable. </p> <p>Foster's scheme at the Baltic Exchange is currently the biggest tower with a serious chance of being built in the City, though it still has to clear the Court of Common Council and get the go- ahead from John Prescott. But Foster is already building the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's world headquarters at Canary Wharf, and has plans for something almost as big at the Elephant and Castle in south-east London. </p> <p>Ken Yeang is planning another 50-storey tower for the same site while Nick Grimshaw is working on yet another big tower erupting from Paddington Station. Richard Rogers has designed a tower 40 stories high just across Paddington Basin from Grimshaw's. </p> <p>London is not exactly suffering from a lack of confidence. It doesn't need to impress anymore, as the Reichmann brothers certainly felt they had to when they hit on the scheme of building the tallest building in Britain, as a giant bill- board advertising their office development at Canary Wharf. </p> <p>And yet London seems bent on reinventing itself as a city of towers on the American model. The trouble until now has been that only the Americans have really known how to build proper skyscrapers. Not in a technical sense, it's just that very few non-American skyscrapers looked any more convincing than the Soviet Union's ham-fisted attempts at building stretch limos. </p> <p>The picture has changed. London is on a roll and seems to have adopted a breezy transatlantic swagger which is beginning to affect its architecture. Perhaps it was Foster's tower, first mooted for the site of the old Baltic Exchange, that triggered the change. Though his scheme for a 90-storey building was withdrawn, London suddenly found that plans for 40-storey towers were becoming commonplace. </p> <p>The new towers share an urge to break out of the straitjacket of the glass box that has dominated the type ever since van der Rohe perfected the original with the Seagram tower. They flaunt their structure, they develop flamboyant curves and project jagged spires. </p> <p>One conspicuous tower planned for Shanghai would have included a Ferris wheel in a circular hole punched through its top 10 floors. Other architects have started to unpick the skyscraper's skin. Instead of sleek, anonymous glass, they cut back the perimeter walls to create high-level gardens and atria. </p> <p>While they may individually end up as more 'interesting', it's hard to see that a crowd of them jostling for attention is going to make for skylines any more satisfactory than those left to us by the enthusiasm of developers in the 1960s for building concrete filing cabinets. But they do struggle to come to terms with the issues of identity and energy use. </p> <p>Building high is not simply a question of cash. You can pack more office space into a 50-storey tower than you can into a eight-storey slab, but as a developer you won't necessarily make more money. With a very tall tower, you can't let any of the space until the whole building is finished. A more modest collection of low rises is quicker to build and can be let bit by bit. </p> <p>Building high goes beyond making money. It taps into the the most primordial of architectural impulses - to impress. In the end, building is not necessarily a rational, calculating process. Nobody is immune. The new cities of the exploding Pacific Rim are all building high. The twin towers of Malaysia's Petronas building, a witness to Prime Minister Mahattir's edifice complex, are taller than anything else in the world, for the simple reason that they are regarded as a national virility symbol. </p> <p>Mahattir deliberately set out to top the Sears tower in Chicago, the city that gave birth to the skyscraper in the first place. Chicago has been stung enough by Malaysia's presumption to build something even taller than their Sears tower, for two decades the tallest building in the world. </p> <p>Under the innocent sounding name of Seven South Dearborn, the Skidmore Owings and Merrill practice has designed a needle-shaped structure that will retake the title of tallest tower.</p>",

Though his scheme for a 90-storey building was withdrawn, London suddenly found that plans for 40-storey towers were becoming commonplace. The new towers share an urge to break out of the straitjacket of the glass box that has dominated the type ever since van der Rohe perfected the original with the Seagram tower. They flaunt their structure, they develop flamboyant curves and project jagged spires. One conspicuous tower planned for Shanghai would have included a Ferris wheel in a circular hole punched through its top 10 floors. Other architects have started to unpick the skyscraper's skin. Instead of sleek, anonymous glass, they cut back the perimeter walls to create high-level gardens and atria. While they may individually end up as more 'interesting', it's hard to see that a crowd of them jostling for attention is going to make for skylines any more satisfactory than those left to us by the enthusiasm of developers in the 1960s for building concrete filing cabinets. But they do struggle to come to terms with the issues of identity and energy use. Building high is not simply a question of cash. You can pack more office space into a 50-storey tower than you can into a eight-storey slab, but as a developer you won't necessarily make more money. With a very tall tower, you can't let any of the space until the whole building is finished. A more modest collection of low rises is quicker to build and can be let bit by bit. Building high goes beyond making money. It taps into the the most primordial of architectural impulses - to impress. In the end, building is not necessarily a rational, calculating process. Nobody is immune. The new cities of the exploding Pacific Rim are all building high. The twin towers of Malaysia's Petronas building, a witness to Prime Minister Mahattir's edifice complex, are taller than anything else in the world, for the simple reason that they are regarded as a national virility symbol. Mahattir deliberately set out to top the Sears tower in Chicago, the city that gave birth to the skyscraper in the first place. Chicago has been stung enough by Malaysia's presumption to build something even taller than their Sears tower, for two decades the tallest building in the world. Under the innocent sounding name of Seven South Dearborn, the Skidmore Owings and Merrill practice has designed a needle-shaped structure that will retake the title of tallest tower.",

Jane Glover conducted, as she had for L'Allegro 's previous performances in 1997. By last Thursday, she and the dancers were soaring on the same wavelength, after a spaced-out opening night. </p> <p>Dancers en masse need a pulse, whether linked in a unison line or passing motifs from one cluster to another. Morris's group dynamics are so powerful that soloists seem vulnerable on their own - though no one is alone for long. As if in sympathy, the four solo singers are protected in the pit, while the chorus flanks the proscenium in tiered boxes. When they join in, celebrating the 'busy hum of men', the auditorium buzzes like a gigantic hive. </p> <p>Handel's oratorio contrasts the man-made pleasures of the city with those of rural life. Morris populates the stage with scenes from town and country, his dancers metamorphosing from trees and bushes into hounds and hunters, lords and ladies, alfresco lovers and drowsy children. A nar rative thread meanders through ever-changing landscapes which dissolve and reform like passing clouds. </p> <p>As melancholy finally gives way to mirth, the voice of the reasonable man, il Moderato, has a go at 'restoring intellectual day'. But ecstasy triumphs over order and moderation. A kaleidoscope of dancers in Adrianne Lobel's silken costumes merges with the music, skirts and trumpets flaring. Their swirling geometry, all the colours of the firmament, is how the Hubble telescope sees the dance of the spheres. </p> <p>Singers and dancers alternated in last Wednesday's <strong> White Nights Gala</strong> for the Maryinsky and Royal Opera House companies. The combined forces of the Kirov and Royal choruses in extracts from Otello and Prince Igor almost lifted the newly gilded ceiling. The swoosh of cymbals raised Faroukh Ruzimatov off the ground in Le Corsaire pas de deux. He doesn't really jump any more but he gives good gala. </p> <p>Royal Ballet dancers appropriated Vaganova's 'Diana and Actaeon' duet. Marianela Nunez fulfilled all the promise she has only hinted at, stuck in the company's lower ranks; Carlos Acosta blazed like a comet. Neither, of course, is British. The charmers of the evening were a Dane, Johan Kobborg, and a Canadian, Jaimie Tapper, who flirted with each other in the 'Flower Festival at Genzano' pas de deux. Suddenly, real people were dancing for the pleasure of it - just as Mark Morris's band of revellers do.</p>",

Jane Glover conducted, as she had for L'Allegro 's previous performances in 1997. By last Thursday, she and the dancers were soaring on the same wavelength, after a spaced-out opening night. Dancers en masse need a pulse, whether linked in a unison line or passing motifs from one cluster to another. Morris's group dynamics are so powerful that soloists seem vulnerable on their own - though no one is alone for long. As if in sympathy, the four solo singers are protected in the pit, while the chorus flanks the proscenium in tiered boxes. When they join in, celebrating the 'busy hum of men', the auditorium buzzes like a gigantic hive. Handel's oratorio contrasts the man-made pleasures of the city with those of rural life. Morris populates the stage with scenes from town and country, his dancers metamorphosing from trees and bushes into hounds and hunters, lords and ladies, alfresco lovers and drowsy children. A nar rative thread meanders through ever-changing landscapes which dissolve and reform like passing clouds. As melancholy finally gives way to mirth, the voice of the reasonable man, il Moderato, has a go at 'restoring intellectual day'. But ecstasy triumphs over order and moderation. A kaleidoscope of dancers in Adrianne Lobel's silken costumes merges with the music, skirts and trumpets flaring. Their swirling geometry, all the colours of the firmament, is how the Hubble telescope sees the dance of the spheres. Singers and dancers alternated in last Wednesday's White Nights Gala for the Maryinsky and Royal Opera House companies. The combined forces of the Kirov and Royal choruses in extracts from Otello and Prince Igor almost lifted the newly gilded ceiling. The swoosh of cymbals raised Faroukh Ruzimatov off the ground in Le Corsaire pas de deux. He doesn't really jump any more but he gives good gala. Royal Ballet dancers appropriated Vaganova's 'Diana and Actaeon' duet. Marianela Nunez fulfilled all the promise she has only hinted at, stuck in the company's lower ranks; Carlos Acosta blazed like a comet. Neither, of course, is British. The charmers of the evening were a Dane, Johan Kobborg, and a Canadian, Jaimie Tapper, who flirted with each other in the 'Flower Festival at Genzano' pas de deux. Suddenly, real people were dancing for the pleasure of it - just as Mark Morris's band of revellers do.",

It shows that realism on the stage doesn't have to be stolid; it shows that an argumentative play needn't be tendentious, and that its characters needn't be ciphers. And it proves that the question 'what's going to happen?' can be as penetrating and productive as the more familiar theatrical query: 'What's it all about?' </p> <p>Arthur Miller's play was first staged in 1947: later that year a performance for US troops in Germany was cancelled on the grounds that it was 'a Party Line play'. That accusation now sounds daft, but the play is still provoking: in pitting family loyalty against social conscience, it goes to the heart of the American Dream, and savages it. </p> <p>An affectionate father and meticulous businessman has indirectly caused the death of one of his sons by supplying faulty parts to the American airforce. This is the nub of the play, approached through action which uncoils slowly, revealing delusions, memories and conflicting responses. Uncomfortable questions about the legacy of the Second World War are raised: questions about profiteering and about the guilt of the survivor. This is a play which is as detailed as a novel, but which never loses its dramatic pulse. </p> <p>And it is beautifully realised in a production that has only good performances. Julie Walters, returning to the stage after an absence of nine years, is by turns shrewd and crumpled as the mother who can't believe in the death of her son, but who can credit the guilt of her husband. Under a dowager's hump, she is shaken by tiny quivers; in repose, her face settles into perplexity. Catherine McCormack, who is best known for her appearances in Braveheart and Land Girls, declines with magical lightness from radiance to disconsolateness. And, in the part of the surviving son who is also the play's conscience, Ben Daniels, moving from hesitancy to ferocity, consolidates his growing reputation as an actor who can bring to life the most orthodox of parts. </p> <p>This cast plays together wonderfully well. Listen to the terrible concerto of sighs, when at the breaking of news Julie Walters lets out a dry grinding groan, and Catherine McCormack whimpers. Watch six of the actors in a circle, clenched together, but each reacting differently to a piece of news.

Michael Boyd's production at Stratford takes the opposite approach, creating a harsh arena in which Romeo and Juliet's feelings are alien. </p> <p>Hostility reigns. Tom Piper's design is a grey S-shaped bunker, splattered with tomato sauce from an explosive fight in the opening moments, cheerlessly flashed with violet or scarlet neon. The dances are full of straddling and heaving: Lady Capulet looks as if she's copping off with Tybalt. A small band, led by an accordionist, supplies unconsoling music by Stephen Warbeck. </p> <p>All this is sensible, but it stamps on intimacy and romantic intoxication. Forced to assert themselves against their overbearing surroundings, the lovers are neither fresh nor fervent. David Tennant loses his natural fluidity of movement and tongue: as if hell-bent on being non-lyrical, he ends up rasping and reedy. Alexandra Gilbreath, who is obliged to squirm on the top of the bunker in the balcony scene, and later to appear draped in ropes, plays full tilt the humour of Juliet's contra dictoriness, but at the risk of being pert. Too often she drowns the sense of the lines in the many layers of her remarkable voice. Too often she is commanding where she should be carried away: when she instructs the horses of the sun to gallop, she does so with the imperiousness of a riding-mistress.

      "body": "<p>There are some things best left to the market, and theatre is not one of them. Standing in a queue for Tate Modern, 2,000 of us happy in the rain, I wondered why waiting to go into a theatre never felt like this: people of all ages and professions with only one thing in common - none of us paid to get in. Chris Smith's attempt to secure free entry for museums is a civilised and proper gesture, and \u00a36 million of government money has turned Tate Modern into a true people's palace. No one seems to think the idea of modern art for free is ridiculous - should theatre be treated the same way?</p> <p>In my experience, where people might consider a film or a gig as a good way to spend Friday night, most of them think theatre is shouting in the evenings for posh people. If your parents don't take you and your school doesn't organise visits to the theatre, it's very easy to grow up without ever setting foot inside one. When I can get into a club for a fiver, and buy an E for a tenner, and know I'll have a great time, no one should be surprised if I go to the club more often than a show. An entire generation has got out of the theatre habit: education, prejudice and attention span are all partly to blame, but the biggest barrier is expense. As an incentive to people who don't like theatre because they've never tried it, a proportion of seats should be free. There will always be those who save hard to afford the outrageous prices, but unless we make it easy and cheap for some of the others, those who grew up on cheap and easy visits will be dead and there will be no one to replace them.</p> <p>Last year, about 11 million people watched a Premiership football match, and about 9 million went to the theatre. It's no coincidence that many ordinary fans are kept away from live football by the spiralling costs and 'executive club' feel at some grounds. Why can't cheap theatre be the new football, only putting on the 4-3 thrillers and avoiding the dull 0-0 draws on a windy November Tuesday?</p> <p>Twenty years ago, this article would not have been written. To suggest that subsidised theatres should be funded well enough to make some of their seats free was not always naive. Subsidy of companies by the Arts Council and of venues by local councils was set at a level where theatre could often afford to cost its audience nothing. In the late Seventies the idea surfaced that art should try to break even or better; the vocabulary of mar ket forces shifted the debate, and it has never shifted back. A theatre is a place where every person's response is as valid as their neighbour's - why should that neighbour get a better seat just because they earn more?</p> <p>No theatre now can afford to have a truly inclusive access policy. Seat prices are set at a level which the marketing department think the market can take.

      "bodyText": "There are some things best left to the market, and theatre is not one of them. Standing in a queue for Tate Modern, 2,000 of us happy in the rain, I wondered why waiting to go into a theatre never felt like this: people of all ages and professions with only one thing in common - none of us paid to get in. Chris Smith's attempt to secure free entry for museums is a civilised and proper gesture, and \u00a36 million of government money has turned Tate Modern into a true people's palace. No one seems to think the idea of modern art for free is ridiculous - should theatre be treated the same way? In my experience, where people might consider a film or a gig as a good way to spend Friday night, most of them think theatre is shouting in the evenings for posh people. If your parents don't take you and your school doesn't organise visits to the theatre, it's very easy to grow up without ever setting foot inside one. When I can get into a club for a fiver, and buy an E for a tenner, and know I'll have a great time, no one should be surprised if I go to the club more often than a show. An entire generation has got out of the theatre habit: education, prejudice and attention span are all partly to blame, but the biggest barrier is expense. As an incentive to people who don't like theatre because they've never tried it, a proportion of seats should be free. There will always be those who save hard to afford the outrageous prices, but unless we make it easy and cheap for some of the others, those who grew up on cheap and easy visits will be dead and there will be no one to replace them. Last year, about 11 million people watched a Premiership football match, and about 9 million went to the theatre. It's no coincidence that many ordinary fans are kept away from live football by the spiralling costs and 'executive club' feel at some grounds. Why can't cheap theatre be the new football, only putting on the 4-3 thrillers and avoiding the dull 0-0 draws on a windy November Tuesday? Twenty years ago, this article would not have been written. To suggest that subsidised theatres should be funded well enough to make some of their seats free was not always naive. Subsidy of companies by the Arts Council and of venues by local councils was set at a level where theatre could often afford to cost its audience nothing. In the late Seventies the idea surfaced that art should try to break even or better; the vocabulary of mar ket forces shifted the debate, and it has never shifted back. A theatre is a place where every person's response is as valid as their neighbour's - why should that neighbour get a better seat just because they earn more? No theatre now can afford to have a truly inclusive access policy. Seat prices are set at a level which the marketing department think the market can take. The irony is that the better an organisation uses its subsidy, and the more inclusive its access, the less it takes at the box office. Years of frozen grants have led to a \u00a34million deficit in our regional theatres - one-sixth of the money provided to keep the Dome solvent for a month. There are excellent privately run audience development schemes which distribute unsold tickets free, but you can't build an audience by bringing them only to the shows you can't sell.

      "body": "<p>They're known as 'the meat'. They guard the stage at rock gigs and festivals, a wall of muscle separating performers from feverish fans. It's part of rock lore that these inhabitants of the pit are humourless thugs who despise music and only smile when forcibly evacuating some poor sweaty kid from the stage. I go to gigs all the time, and I've often wondered, standing on the outer edge of the moshpit - the section of the crowd just in front of the stage where the most active fans gather to jump up and down and slam into each other - what these two groups of people think of each other. Are they really enemies, or is there some deeper symbiotic link between them? </p> <p>Both groups - moshing fans and stage security - are under attack again at the moment, in the wake of the tragedy at the Roskilde festival in Denmark last weekend, when, during a set by US hard rock band Pearl Jam, nine young men were suffocated to death in a field of mud, accidentally trampled underfoot by the collective pressure of the 70,000-strong crowd. </p> <p>Although the police inquiry will take months to reach its conclusion, the whispering has already started: that the fans were drunk, and made no effort to save the people who had fallen into the mud; that the security guards ignored warnings that people were being crushed, that one of them heartlessly told a fan, 'In a couple of years you'll forget all about it.' </p> <p>Such horror stories are common in the aftermath of tragedies involving large numbers of people and confined spaces, and there is no way of proving or disproving them until much later. The same kinds of rumours circulated after Hillsborough, after the Kings Cross tube fire, the Paddington rail crash. The same stories were told last year, after 54 people died in a stampede to escape a lightning storm at a rock concert in Belarus. </p> <p>Since the infamous Rolling Stones free concert at Altamont speedway in 1969, when the Hell's Angels hired to provide security attacked people with pool cues and knives, murdering one man, rock shows have been sporadi cally associated with carnage. (This country has one of the best safety records in the world: the worst such tragedy in Britain was the death of two fans during the Monsters of Rock festival in 1985.) In every case, recrimination has focused either on the stage security or on the fans, often both. </p> <p>There are, routinely, calls to outlaw the practice of 'moshing' and 'bodysurfing', even to ban heavy rock bands (who tend to most inspire this behaviour) from certain festivals. Michael Eavis, the organiser of Glastonbury Festival, said last week: 'One of the most dangerous things is \"moshing\", where the crowd... start climbing over each other - we try very hard to avoid it, or halt it.' </p> <p>Anyone who has been to gigs and festivals as a fan knows that this is both impossible and undesirable. The whole point of going to see a hard rock band is to abandon yourself physically. (In fact, moshing is a lot less dangerous than its Seventies and Eighties predecessor, headbanging, which destroyed about 1,000 braincells every second.) There are always a few nutters, but on the whole, moshing is good-natured and no more dangerous than walking down Oxford Street on a Saturday morning. </p> <p>As for bodysurfing - where the protagonist is carried above his fellow fans on a sea of hands and deposited into the arms of a waiting security guard - well, the best person to ask about that is surely one of those doing the catching. How does it feel to be on the frontline facing a thousand screaming, writhing fans, and what do security guards really think of them? </p> <p>Tom Clements is co-director of Specialised Security, a Scottish firm who provide stage security at most of the major rock festivals in Britain, including Glastonbury and Reading. Does he understand why the fans behave as they do? 'Oh aye,' he says. 'I'm rather a large lad now, but when I was thinner, I went to see bands all the time, as a fan. I've certainly experienced bodysurfing and crowd sways, as have all our staff - because we encourage them to do it.' </p> <p>Is he aware of the negative perception many fans have of people in his profession? 'Absolutely, and it's something we're trying to change,' says Clements. 'We don't want to be perceived as hired thugs who just want to chat up women and bash people. So our staff sing along to the songs, talk to the people in front of them. We try to do everything we can to break down this barrier between us and the fans.' </p> <p>In 16 years of going to gigs, I say, I have never seen a single security man singing along with a band. 'Well, not all security people are like us,' he admits. </p> <p>Anyway, his firm, however progressive, does not employ people on the basis of a nice smile or a love of Smashing Pumpkins. 'Ultimately, they're there to work, not hand out flowers. We have a rigorous training course, where staff learn lifting techniques, how to recognise stress, how to deal with headrollers [bodysurfers]. People in the pit need stamina. You don't need to be built like a brick shithouse...' But it helps, of course. </p> <p>There is more to saving lives, however, than brute force. Clements emphasises the amount of planning that goes into festivals. At Reading last year, the cost of stage security was more than \u00a3200,000. Up to 250 guards were employed at one time, helping bodysurfers who came over the barrier at a rate of more than one per second. Forty thousand paper cups of water were handed out. A medical team was always stationed by the side of the stage. And, a month before the first band took the stage, Clements was on site with Melvin Benn, festivals director for the promoter, Mean Fiddler, seeking out potential problems. 'You cannot take chances,' he says. 'You've got to look at every blade of grass.' </p> <p>Though softly spoken and in his forties, Melvin Benn is an even bigger rock fan than Tom Clements. 'The first festival I ever went to was Reading in 1972. I hitch-hiked down from Yorkshire, and it was fantastic. The excitement in the crowd is phenomenal. I wholly understand it.' In contrast to Michael Eavis, he is '100 per cent opposed' to any legislation against moshing. 'It would take away all the excitement. And I don't accept that it's inherently dangerous. It can and does happen frequently in a very safe manner.' </p> <p>Asked whether what happened at Roskilde could happen at Reading, he says: 'I don't know enough about the details to answer that question. What I do know is that we've had huge mudslides before at Reading, but we always prepare for that by having lots of hay and gravel and other drying agents. Preparation is the key.' Professionalism, too: ironically, the strongest criticism aimed at the stewards and security at Roskilde has been that it was a volunteer force: friendly, peaceable, but crucially inexperienced. </p> <p>Benn, who worked with the Home Office to produce the current code of practice for concert promoters, is proud of the fact that Reading, despite a higher proportion of heavy rock bands than any other festival in Britain, has never been the scene of a death. 'At our festivals, where we've got very active performers, moshing is expected; crowd sways and crowd surges are expected. I know that's going to happen - it always has - and I plan on that basis. Touch wood, we've got a very good safety record.' </p> <p>Not only does Benn defend the stagedivers and bodysurfers, but he is positively evangelistic about the virtues of the men in the pit. 'I've been in there with them, and it is a truly awe-inspiring spectacle, watching these men at work. They're so dedicated. They really help people and look after people.' </p> <p>His eulogising brings to mind J.D. Salinger's most famous and tender passage: 'I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye... if they're running and they don't look where they're going, I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye.' </p> <p>But if rock security guards really are the catchers in the rye, then why do they still have a reputation as heartless thugs? Benn puts it down to the 'daily experiences of music fans who go to clubs with rude doormen and bouncers'. Clements thinks the tide is turning. 'There's been a big change from 10 years ago,' he says. 'At the last Reading Festival, lots of the kids came up and thanked us for helping them have such a great time. That's really gratifying.'</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>After a flirtation with serious acting, Jim Carrey returns to comedy in  Me, Myself &amp; Irene. But can he reclaim his crown as Hollywood's funniest man, asks  Mark Morris</p>",
      "byline": "Mark Morris",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Here's how Jim Carrey became Hollywood's most famous funny guy: a man walks into a police station, and starts talking to one of the detectives. Only, not quite in the normal way. In fact, he's turned right round, and moving his trousers in such way that it appears he's, well, talking out of his arse. The detective begs him to stop, because his boss is about to arrive. But of course, he keeps going...</p> <p>'Until Ace Ventura, no actor had considered talking through his ass,' Carrey claims. He's disregarding the rather more extreme 'singing asshole' in John Waters's Pink Flamingoes, but original or not, it worked for Carrey. For a whirlwind two years from 1994, it was the stuff of his fortune. In the two Ace Ventura films, The Mask and most of all, Dumb And Dumber, he used silly walks, contorted faces, ever odder hair and just the right amount of offensiveness to make people laugh.Eleven years after his first film, his wage packet rocketed to $20 million. At the same time, he became the target for serious-minded cultural critics who found the title of Ace Ventura; When Nature Calls almost too much too bear, let alone the film itself. </p> <p>And then two things happened: first, Carrey went too far. Then he had a go at serious acting. Now, having emerged bitterly empty handed from two Oscar ceremonies, he's back doing what made him a star. </p> <p>'I don't want to get uppity,' he says. 'The danger now for me is to start choosing all my parts because they're good for an Oscar. I like to be funny. That's a great thing. I never decided at one point, \"OK, I'm going to be serious actor\". I just want to do everything I can! I love those kinds of movies. I like to get down and dirty and do comedy. It's a way of throwing the hounds off.' </p> <p> Me, Myself &amp; Irene certainly seems to have all the ingredients. It's made by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, who got their start with Carrey (Dumb And Dumber) but have prospered without him (There's Something About Mary). Carrey plays a highway patrolman with a split personality and a terrible haircut. There is a recurring dildo, an albino, a scene were Carrey suckles mother's milk, an obscene chicken gag, an enraged black midget and Carrey defecating on a lawn. But just as importantly, it it has an underlying sweetness. That's the rule of contemporary mainstream comedy, the reason why American Pie was a big success. You can have all the jokes you like about about sexual diseases, the disabled, and anal sex, as long as your central characters are essentially gentle and decent souls. </p> <p>The question is whether Carrey has gone too far to come back. So far the US box office for Me, Myself &amp; Irene has been disappointing by industry standards: ie a vast amount of people have seen it, but not nearly as many as saw There's Something About Mary. Maybe Carrey has just confused the audience a little too much. If Me, Myself &amp; Irene lets Carrey's nice side and dark side do battle, then 1996's The Cable Guy was too much dark side. </p> <p>Made right at the time Carrey seemed unassailable, he choose to play the deranged TV salesman who tries to take over Matthew Broderick's life. Most terrifying was the scene where he turns an OAP karaoke into a one-man recreation of Altamont, doing a violent rendition of the Jefferson Airplane's 'Somebody To Love'. It's a good film. But it breaks those rules: there's no softness there at all, just desperation, loneliness and revenge. </p> <p>Then Carrey followed the path of reformed comedians Steve Martin and Robin Williams into serious acting. And surprised everyone. In truth, The Truman Show wasn't that much of a stretch. Peter Weir just harnessed the innocent side of Carrey, told him to cut down on the contorted faces, and used him in the service of a big idea or two (is it a film about the overwhelming power of the media or the death of God? Take your pick). Man On The Moon was a slightly different matter: his insistence on the most extreme kind of method acting, of insisting he was Andy Kaufman, might have been true to the spirit of the movie and the man, but it worried people. </p> <p>'Yeah, I went to bed as him,' he admitted, 'Walked down my hall in the dark, turning off lights in the middle of night, completely gone in this thing.

      "bodyText": "Here's how Jim Carrey became Hollywood's most famous funny guy: a man walks into a police station, and starts talking to one of the detectives. Only, not quite in the normal way. In fact, he's turned right round, and moving his trousers in such way that it appears he's, well, talking out of his arse. The detective begs him to stop, because his boss is about to arrive. But of course, he keeps going... 'Until Ace Ventura, no actor had considered talking through his ass,' Carrey claims. He's disregarding the rather more extreme 'singing asshole' in John Waters's Pink Flamingoes, but original or not, it worked for Carrey. For a whirlwind two years from 1994, it was the stuff of his fortune. In the two Ace Ventura films, The Mask and most of all, Dumb And Dumber, he used silly walks, contorted faces, ever odder hair and just the right amount of offensiveness to make people laugh.Eleven years after his first film, his wage packet rocketed to $20 million. At the same time, he became the target for serious-minded cultural critics who found the title of Ace Ventura; When Nature Calls almost too much too bear, let alone the film itself. And then two things happened: first, Carrey went too far. Then he had a go at serious acting. Now, having emerged bitterly empty handed from two Oscar ceremonies, he's back doing what made him a star. 'I don't want to get uppity,' he says. 'The danger now for me is to start choosing all my parts because they're good for an Oscar. I like to be funny. That's a great thing. I never decided at one point, \"OK, I'm going to be serious actor\". I just want to do everything I can! I love those kinds of movies. I like to get down and dirty and do comedy. It's a way of throwing the hounds off.' Me, Myself &amp; Irene certainly seems to have all the ingredients. It's made by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, who got their start with Carrey (Dumb And Dumber) but have prospered without him (There's Something About Mary). Carrey plays a highway patrolman with a split personality and a terrible haircut. There is a recurring dildo, an albino, a scene were Carrey suckles mother's milk, an obscene chicken gag, an enraged black midget and Carrey defecating on a lawn. But just as importantly, it it has an underlying sweetness. That's the rule of contemporary mainstream comedy, the reason why American Pie was a big success. You can have all the jokes you like about about sexual diseases, the disabled, and anal sex, as long as your central characters are essentially gentle and decent souls. The question is whether Carrey has gone too far to come back. So far the US box office for Me, Myself &amp; Irene has been disappointing by industry standards: ie a vast amount of people have seen it, but not nearly as many as saw There's Something About Mary. Maybe Carrey has just confused the audience a little too much. If Me, Myself &amp; Irene lets Carrey's nice side and dark side do battle, then 1996's The Cable Guy was too much dark side. Made right at the time Carrey seemed unassailable, he choose to play the deranged TV salesman who tries to take over Matthew Broderick's life. Most terrifying was the scene where he turns an OAP karaoke into a one-man recreation of Altamont, doing a violent rendition of the Jefferson Airplane's 'Somebody To Love'. It's a good film. But it breaks those rules: there's no softness there at all, just desperation, loneliness and revenge. Then Carrey followed the path of reformed comedians Steve Martin and Robin Williams into serious acting. And surprised everyone. In truth, The Truman Show wasn't that much of a stretch. Peter Weir just harnessed the innocent side of Carrey, told him to cut down on the contorted faces, and used him in the service of a big idea or two (is it a film about the overwhelming power of the media or the death of God? Take your pick). Man On The Moon was a slightly different matter: his insistence on the most extreme kind of method acting, of insisting he was Andy Kaufman, might have been true to the spirit of the movie and the man, but it worried people. 'Yeah, I went to bed as him,' he admitted, 'Walked down my hall in the dark, turning off lights in the middle of night, completely gone in this thing. Woke up in the morning and jumped into his shoes.' It all created a sense of something not quite right, especially as Carrey's interviews had grown pained and confessional, detailing the childhood poverty, the failed marriages. And there was an appearance at an awards programme as a Manson-Jim Morrison hybrid, a Kaufman-esque gag which was clever but not remotely funny. All of which makes it hard to believe him when he turns around and tries to reassure everyone that he's just that loveable, knockaround guy after all.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps you are reading this in your weekend cottage, curled up beside your inglenook with the scent of honeysuckle wafting through open, leaded windows. Perhaps herbs hang from the beams above your Aga and they are haymaking in the fields down the lane. If so, I feel sorry for you.</p> <p>I had a country cottage once. Big mistake. But like Wordsworth, or for that matter, the Daily Mail, which is offering readers the chance to win the cottage of their dreams, I was in thrall to the fantasy that 'a wilderness is rich with liberty'. All I needed to make my life complete, to give me time and space to write novels, to work my way through Nigella Lawson's recipes and garden like Beth Chatto, was a period property in a field.</p> <p>Of course, I knew even then that the national obsession with bricks and mortar is stupid and damaging. I knew that the houses advertised by posh estate agents at the front of Country Life wouldn't really solve all my problems. But it's hard to be rational when newspaper property pages constantly taunt you with the possibility of a stone house in Oxfordshire with stream and delphiniums, all for the cost of a large cupboard in London.</p> <p>Nostalgia for the countryside is central to English sensibility. The Compleat Angler, published in 1653, has been through nearly 400 editions; The Natural History of Selborne and Lark Rise to Candleford are still selling. We all carry around in our heads images of stout yeomen harvesting with pitchforks and we are moved by the evocativeness of words like stooks and byres, threshing and winnowing.</p> <p>Or we are if we haven't actually tried it. Like Fran Leibovitz, I have discovered that I am not, after all, the type who wants to go back to the land; I am the type who wants to go back to the hotel.</p> <p>The first big difficulty is that the country is so far away. First, you have to queue through a bottleneck to get on to the motorway, then you have to queue through the bottleneck that is the motorway. Then, when it's finally possible to put your foot down, all the other motorists are so frustrated and steaming with pent-up aggression that getting there in one piece is only moderately likely. Life-insurance forms should include weekend cottages among their dangerous pastimes.</p> <p>In my case, this horrible journey followed a day packing up all the possessions that the household might conceivably need for the weekend. Since I was meant to be working on Fridays, rather than running around the house thinking 'balloon whisk/teething ring/champagne flutes', I was already suffering stratospheric levels of stress before I set off. And then about halfway through the Blackwall Tunnel, with traffic backed up behind and solid ahead, I'd realise I'd forgotten my contact-lens solution.</p> <p>So the first lesson I learnt is that there's no point in even contemplating a weekend cottage unless you can afford two food processors. Two of everything, in fact, because how are you supposed to learn to cook like Nigella when her book's 100 miles away in your other kitchen? But say you've got the second music system and widescreen television, RHS plant encyclopaedia and CD collection - because what's the point of spending your leisure time being less comfort able than you'd be at home? You still need to bring fresh parmesan. The whole point of a weekend cottage is to get away from it all,which is fine until you realise you're 10 miles away from the nearest lemon.</p> <p>So you spend the whole of Saturday morning driving to a town in order to visit the supermarket on the ring-road. (There's no point bothering with the village shops because the vegetables are withered and they don't do organics.) The journey takes ages because there's more queuing - behind farm machinery this time - and you have to keep backing up to let the locals' Range-Rovers down the lanes.</p> <p>By Saturday afternoon, I'd start noticing the dust on the surfaces and the grime on the kitchen floor. After that came the weary realisation that delphiniums don't appear in the cottage garden as a matter of course, as they do in the photographs. (Meanwhile, my London garden wasn't getting any attention at all, despite being the one I had to spend all week viewing from my desk.)</p> <p>By Saturday night, I was exhausted by domestic maintenance and quite glad I didn't know anyone locally. (The protectionism of rural England, like the nostalgia for rural England, has a fine pedigree: in 1844, William Wordsworth fulminated that the railway would bring 'the whole of Lancashire and no small part of Yorkshire' into his Lake District.) Of course I didn't know any one anywhere else either, as I was never around for dinner parties.</p> <p>And there's nowhere quite like a rural village for class distinctions. 'I always tell my WI ladies to iron their wrapping paper and reuse it,' the woman from the big house once advised me when she caught me throwing some away. So if you want interesting dinner companions who aren't going to start lecturing you about your domestic arrangements, you have to import them. That means either owning a castle or lots of sleeping bags. One gets too old for that.</p> <p>You have to have their children as well, although there's only a couple of years when children and the country go together, and even then you have to take care to keep them indoors when the locals are crop-spraying. Too young and you're neurotic about them drowning in the stream; older and they don't want to come because there are no clubs in Gloucestershire and the pubs are full of old people.</p> <p>I rapidly reached the conclusion that the countryside lobby is right and we townies don't understand them. We're not trained for it. I don't know which bits of the elderflower are poisonous, if any, so I can't make cordial. I don't like craft fairs or have anything to contribute to them. I don't either wear green wellies or sandals and flowing skirts. Outdoors, for me, is something you pass through on the way to DKNY.</p> <p>The countryside is not full of winnowing and baling peasants, as it is in my head, but of concrete silos, mad cows, cruel chicken sheds, chemical-singed fields and motocross meets. And I fear that to want a weekend cottage is to reveal a deeply unattractive aspect of human nature: the desire for something mainly because most people can't have it.</p> <p>Hazlitt thought that the nostalgia for all things rural was to do with our seeing natural objects as classes of things rather than individuals, so that a primrose seen in adulthood seems to us the same as a primrose seen in childhood. In other words, the cult of the countryside represents an attempt to return to our past; it's a kind of infantilism.</p> <p>I sold my cottage - I couldn't afford it - and I decided I'd rather deal with my unease about the pace of modern life in town than try fruitlessly to hide from it behind a high hedge.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps you are reading this in your weekend cottage, curled up beside your inglenook with the scent of honeysuckle wafting through open, leaded windows. Perhaps herbs hang from the beams above your Aga and they are haymaking in the fields down the lane. If so, I feel sorry for you. I had a country cottage once. Big mistake. But like Wordsworth, or for that matter, the Daily Mail, which is offering readers the chance to win the cottage of their dreams, I was in thrall to the fantasy that 'a wilderness is rich with liberty'. All I needed to make my life complete, to give me time and space to write novels, to work my way through Nigella Lawson's recipes and garden like Beth Chatto, was a period property in a field. Of course, I knew even then that the national obsession with bricks and mortar is stupid and damaging. I knew that the houses advertised by posh estate agents at the front of Country Life wouldn't really solve all my problems. But it's hard to be rational when newspaper property pages constantly taunt you with the possibility of a stone house in Oxfordshire with stream and delphiniums, all for the cost of a large cupboard in London. Nostalgia for the countryside is central to English sensibility. The Compleat Angler, published in 1653, has been through nearly 400 editions; The Natural History of Selborne and Lark Rise to Candleford are still selling. We all carry around in our heads images of stout yeomen harvesting with pitchforks and we are moved by the evocativeness of words like stooks and byres, threshing and winnowing. Or we are if we haven't actually tried it. Like Fran Leibovitz, I have discovered that I am not, after all, the type who wants to go back to the land; I am the type who wants to go back to the hotel. The first big difficulty is that the country is so far away. First, you have to queue through a bottleneck to get on to the motorway, then you have to queue through the bottleneck that is the motorway. Then, when it's finally possible to put your foot down, all the other motorists are so frustrated and steaming with pent-up aggression that getting there in one piece is only moderately likely. Life-insurance forms should include weekend cottages among their dangerous pastimes. In my case, this horrible journey followed a day packing up all the possessions that the household might conceivably need for the weekend. Since I was meant to be working on Fridays, rather than running around the house thinking 'balloon whisk/teething ring/champagne flutes', I was already suffering stratospheric levels of stress before I set off. And then about halfway through the Blackwall Tunnel, with traffic backed up behind and solid ahead, I'd realise I'd forgotten my contact-lens solution. So the first lesson I learnt is that there's no point in even contemplating a weekend cottage unless you can afford two food processors. Two of everything, in fact, because how are you supposed to learn to cook like Nigella when her book's 100 miles away in your other kitchen? But say you've got the second music system and widescreen television, RHS plant encyclopaedia and CD collection - because what's the point of spending your leisure time being less comfort able than you'd be at home? You still need to bring fresh parmesan. The whole point of a weekend cottage is to get away from it all,which is fine until you realise you're 10 miles away from the nearest lemon. So you spend the whole of Saturday morning driving to a town in order to visit the supermarket on the ring-road. (There's no point bothering with the village shops because the vegetables are withered and they don't do organics.) The journey takes ages because there's more queuing - behind farm machinery this time - and you have to keep backing up to let the locals' Range-Rovers down the lanes. By Saturday afternoon, I'd start noticing the dust on the surfaces and the grime on the kitchen floor. After that came the weary realisation that delphiniums don't appear in the cottage garden as a matter of course, as they do in the photographs. (Meanwhile, my London garden wasn't getting any attention at all, despite being the one I had to spend all week viewing from my desk.) By Saturday night, I was exhausted by domestic maintenance and quite glad I didn't know anyone locally. (The protectionism of rural England, like the nostalgia for rural England, has a fine pedigree: in 1844, William Wordsworth fulminated that the railway would bring 'the whole of Lancashire and no small part of Yorkshire' into his Lake District.) Of course I didn't know any one anywhere else either, as I was never around for dinner parties. And there's nowhere quite like a rural village for class distinctions. 'I always tell my WI ladies to iron their wrapping paper and reuse it,' the woman from the big house once advised me when she caught me throwing some away. So if you want interesting dinner companions who aren't going to start lecturing you about your domestic arrangements, you have to import them. That means either owning a castle or lots of sleeping bags. One gets too old for that. You have to have their children as well, although there's only a couple of years when children and the country go together, and even then you have to take care to keep them indoors when the locals are crop-spraying. Too young and you're neurotic about them drowning in the stream; older and they don't want to come because there are no clubs in Gloucestershire and the pubs are full of old people. I rapidly reached the conclusion that the countryside lobby is right and we townies don't understand them. We're not trained for it. I don't know which bits of the elderflower are poisonous, if any, so I can't make cordial. I don't like craft fairs or have anything to contribute to them. I don't either wear green wellies or sandals and flowing skirts. Outdoors, for me, is something you pass through on the way to DKNY. The countryside is not full of winnowing and baling peasants, as it is in my head, but of concrete silos, mad cows, cruel chicken sheds, chemical-singed fields and motocross meets. And I fear that to want a weekend cottage is to reveal a deeply unattractive aspect of human nature: the desire for something mainly because most people can't have it. Hazlitt thought that the nostalgia for all things rural was to do with our seeing natural objects as classes of things rather than individuals, so that a primrose seen in adulthood seems to us the same as a primrose seen in childhood. In other words, the cult of the countryside represents an attempt to return to our past; it's a kind of infantilism. I sold my cottage - I couldn't afford it - and I decided I'd rather deal with my unease about the pace of modern life in town than try fruitlessly to hide from it behind a high hedge. At least my house in London which is, after all, where I really live, now occasionally gets tidied. And I don't spend Monday recovering from Sunday night swallowing carbon monoxide on the M40. \u0095 Geraldine Bedell's novel, A Fabulous Fling, is published by HarperCollins, price \u00a35.99.

Art, a three-hander about male friendship and its flipside, has become the West End's resident cash cow: every 14 weeks, the conveyor belt disgorges a new triumvirate of celebrities on to the Wyndham's stage, which has proved equally hospitable to established actors and comics wanting to stretch new muscles.</p> <p>Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, Art Malik, Nigel Havers, Frank Skinner, Anton Lesser, Jack Dee... One critic has commented that Art owes its longevity to 'the fact that the roles are as easily renewable as printer cartridges', which, though not particularly flattering, may also reassure the next incumbents: the impressionist Alistair McGowan, stand-up comic Sean Hughes, and Colin Buchanan, best known as the younger one in Dalziel and Pascoe . They are taking over from what are lazily termed 'the Americans': Patrick (Bobby in Dallas ) Duffy, Richard (John-Boy in The Waltons ) Thomas and the (British) RSC stalwart Paul Freeman. Whether you think it's a banal entertainment made palatable by the presence of telly stars, or a ticklish analysis of male relationships, you can't deny this show has legs.</p> <p>Since opening in October 1996, Art has cunningly managed to reinvent itself with every cast change. To prove the point, there are several obsessives who have been back to see every version, finding that new actors bring an entirely new dynamic to the text. Some casts have pleased the critics more than others, but the play has weathered the bumpier patches and is about to coast into its fifth year. The team behind Art saw the potential of putting screen stars on stage long before Nicole Kidman flashed her bottom in The Blue Room . And Because a long line of household names is queueing up to appear (they appreciate the fact that contracts are relatively short, at three months, and that the play only runs for 80 minutes every evening), it's already part of the West End furniture: a production which draws in a new audience every three months. Even sniffy types like the fact that it's written by a French playwright.</p> <p>Alistair McGowan the only member of the new cast who had previously seen the play. Twice, in fact. He bought tickets for the original version with Courtenay and Finney ('I was so wowed by it, it took me a good four days to get it out of my head'), and then, out of curiosity, caught a subsequent production with Jack Dee, Tim Healey and Larry Lamb. 'It creates a bit of a buzz. I wanted to see how the other production differed. If that gets people into the theatre - as well as the quality of the work - then that's fine. People go and see loads of different versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream over the years, just out of interest.'</p> <p>McGowan (35, born in Worcestershire, lives in Hammersmith with his girlfriend, a stage manager) plays Serge, the dermatologist who buys an all-white canvas for 200,000 francs. Buchanan (33, raised in Dundee, lives in Birmingham with his girlfriend and two children) is Serge's old chum Marc, who sneers at it. Hughes (34, grew up in Dublin, lives alone in north London, and last night had an anxiety dream about being burgled by Paul Ince) is Yvan, the hapless piggy-in-the-middle. They're two weeks into rehearsal, under the supervision of Rupert Goold; in grand theatrical tradition, although Matthew Warchus is billed as director, he has yet to meet the cast.</p> <p>For Buchanan, who is the only professional actor in the bunch, theatre has never held much appeal but, having already turned the producers down twice, he'd run out of excuses. 'I wouldn't really have entertained the thought of doing a longer run,' he explains. 'I like to ring the changes, which is another reason why I prefer to do filming rather than theatre. Okay, so you can work on it for weeks beforehand and then build on it while you're actually performing, but I like the idea of doing different things every day. Having said that, Art is a very rich play, and we're pretty much allowed to come to it fresh. I think every cast is encouraged to bring its own dynamic to it. It would probably be very easy for it just to be funny; Alastair and Sean know how to work an audience. But neither of them are doing that with Art . We're not playing it so that Alistair does his impressions and Sean plays it for laughs and I'm deeply serious. We're playing it for real.'</p> <p>He knows McGowan from way back; the pair met while filming TV's Preston Front . 'No, he can't do me,' says Buchanan with small satisfaction. 'He tried, but I'm such a boring twat, he couldn't.'</p> <p>'Some people come easily, some people don't. Colin doesn't,' admits McGowan. 'Maybe he will.' However, he finds Hughes - the startled eyebrows, the meandering delivery - a cinch.</p> <p>'Once Frank [Skinner] and Jack [Dee] had been in it, I thought: \"I'll wait for the call,\"' explains the real Sean Hughes. 'I was really snobbish, I couldn't wait to turn them down. But it came at a certain time for me when I really saw the challenge. I'm interested in doing something that I could fuck up, but doing it well.'</p> <p>The thing that's really worrying Hughes, who runs parallel careers in comedy, novel-writing and broadcasting, but has never tackled straight theatre before, is doing the same thing every night for three months, 'which is not what I'm used to. There is a fair chance that you'll see me in the West End shooting people, shouting: \"I can't say these words anymore! I've squeezed every nuance out of them! I'm no Patrick Duffy!\"'</p> <p>When he accepted the part, he was banking on the fact that McGowan - whom he'd met a few times before - hadn't been to drama school either. Then it emerged that McGowan had in fact trained at the Guildhall, and Hughes's heart sank to his boots. But having done a couple of two-handers at Edinburgh last year, he knew he enjoyed the feeling of sharing the responsibility of performing. 'It's a real joy to be on stage with other people. I'm sick of that weight on my shoulders, and I love the idea of being able to rely on other people. I know Art is perceived as a comedy, but I don't have to prove myself in the funny stakes and I'm going to try my hardest not to mug for laughs.'</p> <p>He pauses, then comes clean: 'Well, I say this, but I probably won't be able to resist it. I've been there all my life, and it's a lovely feeling, milking the laughs. But the joy for me will be... it's like, sometimes in a stand-up show, in the middle of a performance, if you know the audience is totally with you, you can hear the silence.'</p> <p>Buchanan says that Hughes 'completely understands the nature of performing'. But Hughes can't help fretting about what will happen if the audience doesn't react as expected. When things went wrong one night in Edinburgh last summer, he and his co-star adlibbed themselves some therapy, and took the audience apart. 'But,' says Hughes, a little sadly, 'you can't do that in a play.'</p> <p>McGowan always intended to act. After the Guildhall, a friend pointed out that there were fewer good impressionists than good actors, so he made a pragmatic decision to target the comedy circuit, which in turn led to Spitting Image (where he inherited John Major's voice from Steve Coogan). Even people who don't like impressions were charmed by his recent show, where he made mild but insistent mischief with David Beckham and Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen. It might not seem like the obvious point in his career for McGowan to go back to acting, but, he says: 'I've always been a little bit aware of not becoming too pigeonholed. I don't want to shut off any avenues. I've always wanted to do something like this: a play, a good, popular play, in the West End.'</p> <p>Doing impressions, he says, is all about assuming things - wigs, tics, mannerisms - whereas theatre is about the opposite. 'It's a bit scary at first. When you're doing an impression, somehow it's easier and harder at the same time because there's something that you're working towards. It's easy for people to say, \"Actually, that's not right.\" When you do get it right, you know. But with acting, it's more nebulous.'</p> <p>Whereas Hughes finds the stage agreeably crowded, McGowan finds it oddly empty. He's used to playing four people a day. 'Doing that last series, I did something like 55 different characters over a period of three months - and then you leave them all behind. It doesn't necessarily screw you up but it is a bizarre experience when it's all over. \"What do I do? How do I move? How do I speak?\" And although Serge is a character, he's more like me, so you do feel a bit exposed.'</p> <p>Two years ago, McGowan did Endgame and Kafka's Dick at the Nottingham Playhouse. Playing Kafka in the Bennett play was a vaguely alarming experience at first. 'The laughs happen around him, he's fairly straight, and I found it really strange not getting laughs. If you do stand-up, like me and Sean, if you're not getting your laughs, you're doing something wrong. That was a big shock. It's very daunting, just to trust that you're doing something right. Philip Franks, who directed Kafka , said to me, \"If you get your p-part right [of course, McGowan has Franks's breathy, hesitant delivery to a T], then the laughs will happen around you. Don't think that if you're not getting laughs, it's not working.\" It was an invaluable lesson, really.'</p> <p>Next week, they're going to watch 'the Americans' winding down at the Wyndham's. 'We're all going to go and heckle,' says Buchanan. 'By then we'll be in the last week of rehearsals, so hopefully we'll have done it for ourselves quite a few times by then.'</p> <p>Sean Hughes can't wait.

Dutch environmentalists are furious at the idea that a deal would see British Airways channelling millions of extra passengers through Amsterdam, in order to relieve pressure on London. They will try to block the building of a fifth runway at the city's Schiphol Airport if a combined BA-KLM try to use it for vigorous expansion. UK City observers believe that one of the reasons Dutch national airline KLM is so attractive to BA is the expansion potential at Schiphol, where there are already four runways, compared with two at Heathrow and one at Gatwick. While campaigners have stressed that the issue is more about the environment than the politics of ownership, UK City sources said the Dutch green lobby reluctantly tolerated restricted growth by the Netherlands' 'national champion' KLM. However, if the airline became British-owned, it could lose the greens' support. Groups such as Stichting Natuur en Milieu (SNM) and Friends of the Earth have a powerful influence on public opinion and in the Dutch parliament. Heathrow is straining at the seams, and even if a fifth terminal is approved, it will not be completed until at least 2007. As revealed by The Observer in May, BA wants to complete 'preliminary' talks with KLM by early next month before deciding whether to enter detailed negotiations. The two airlines have signalled to the European Commission that they are considering a four-way tie up with Northwest and American Airlines of the US. Jan Fransen, policy director of SNM, said: 'Schiphol should be a quality airport with only the air transport that is for the benefit of the national economy of Holland coming through it. 'We are very scared about a merger of KLM and BA in case the stress on London airports means a lot of low-value traffic coming from Heathrow to Schiphol, and we think there should be concrete assurances that that will not happen.'

This is just what life has been for them. They haven't known anything else. Children are heartbreakingly accepting. They take what's given to them. They go on loving the parents who, for whatever painful reasons of their own, are hurting or neglecting them. In many of their experiences, all those things that most of us hold so dear are given grim inverse meanings. What is a home? A home is where you get put when there's nowhere else to go and no one else who'll have you. What is a childhood? Childhood is powerlessness and pain and loneliness - homesickness, if you like, for the home they've not got. What is a family? A family is where you were in danger, a family is what you have lost. What is care? Care is untender, institutionalised duty and bureaucratic management of you, done by people who sometimes don't care much at all; it's not a warm and fluid verb but a cold noun; you are in care, like being in a room with a high window and a stone floor. What is love? Love is a very dirty word indeed. </p> <p>Where is hope? </p> <p>The Waterhouse Report into the widescale abuse that took place in residential homes in Wales was released 10 days ago. It spoke of systematic abuse, a climate of violence and a culture of secrecy that existed for more than two decades. And it made sensible but unambitious recommendations - such as the appointment of a children's commissioner, and protection for whistleblowers. But for most people involved in the welfare of the young, the report did not go nearly far enough. It confined itself to what went on in particular children's homes in Wales over a confined period. It did not look at the plight of children in residential homes and in foster families all over the UK. It did not question the whole structure of care. The Welsh scandal, like the Cleveland child abuse scandal, came at us in a series of lurid headlines and stories so distressing that most of us didn't really want to hear them. Didn't want to hear how professional carers were paedophiles; how young boys and girls had been sexually abused over years and nobody had listened and nothing had been done. At least 12 of the victims had gone on to kill themselves; one had become a convicted murderer; many others had had their lives wrecked. </p> <p>There will always be children who cannot live with their families. Maybe they have been abused, physically or sexually. Maybe their mother simply cannot cope - because of drugs, alcoholism, illness, severe depression, extreme poverty. And how do we treat these children, the unlucky and the damaged ones? Do our hearts go out to them so that we do everything that we can? Give them a safe structure, professional help, every advantage possible to go a small way towards compensating them for all they've irrevocably lost? Or do we put them in a bleak institution, hire carers who earn as little as \u00a312,000 a year, turn them into 'problems', feed them right back into the vicious circle which produced them? </p> <p>More than 75 per cent of young people leaving care have no formal qualifications at all; high levels of non-attendance and exclusion from school are very common. Between 50-80 per cent are unemployed (the Who Cares? Trust found that many employers mistrust care leavers). An astonishing 23 per cent of adult prisoners and 38 per cent of young offenders have been in care. At least one in seven young women leave care pregnant or as mothers. Sixty per cent use drugs. Many are homeless. Man hands on misery to man; we know this well enough. So what do we do? </p> <p>Twenty years ago, when I left college, I worked for a year-and-a-half in a residential home for disturbed children in the North of England. About 18 children lived there, from toddlers through to teenagers. Some had severe learning difficulties; others were emotionally disturbed. There was a girl there whose parents were brother and sister. She had a flaring temper and tempestuous affections; she'd punch you in the face; land a violent wet kiss on your mouth; sob every night, her red clumsy face screwed up tight with anguish, for her mother who never came to visit. </p> <p>There was a boy who used to paint his bedroom walls with excrement; another who could hold his breath until the blood vessels on his neck popped and he'd pass out; a sexually charged 15-year-old girl who wanted a baby of her own to cuddle. There was a tiny fellow, who'd been severely malnourished as a baby and had arrived at social services curled up naked in a bucket, his distraught mother wailing that she thought her beloved baby was dead. There was a boy I fell in love with, who had a chipped tooth and thick glasses and who never spoke, although everyone knew he could. Every month his mother would come to visit him, and for days after that he would stand at the front door, hour upon hour, waiting for her to come back again. I was young and foolish, and I thought I could love them all better (or even one of them), and, of course, I was wrong. And yet now - two decades and four children later - I look back on my time there and think I was also right. It was a respectable home, no scandals, no children beaten or buggered, but there wasn't much love around. </p> <p>The children lived in a unit. Their rooms all looked alike, same wallpaper on the wall, bobbly chenille bedspreads on narrow beds, fake pine wardrobes in the corner. Maybe a teddy, but precious little else that they could call their own. No photographs pinned up - of their families or of themselves. They all got up at the same time in the morning, and went to bed at the same time at night. They all had breakfast, lunch, dinner, sitting round a long table, and had to eat up no matter what it was. There was a rota for the bathrooms. At weekends, they had supervised activities - jigsaw time, painting time, football-on-the-patch-of-green-lawn time. </p> <p>Sometimes we went on outings, piling into a minibus with identical packed lunches. Everything was planned. Time was parcelled out. They didn't hang around with you, learning how to cook, or go shopping, or sit on your lap in front of the telly, or hang on to your legs while you chat with a friend, or have midnight feasts, or do any of the unplanned things that most children get to do. They didn't spend time one-to-one with an adult. They didn't have much opportunity to tell their own stories. Their lives were so threadbare and so dull. </p> <p>At bedtime, those of us on nights would tuck them in, like parents do with their own children, and kiss them goodnight and maybe sing them a song or read them a book. But we didn't hug them tight and tell them we loved them to bits, and we didn't notice that something was maybe troubling them and sit down to listen to what it was. Later, we didn't creep back to watch them as they slept; tuck the teddy back under their arm or pull the cover back under their chin. And the next night another substitute mother would be there instead, singing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' and looking at her watch, thinking of going back to her real home. </p> <p>Things have changed a lot since those days. Fewer children are in resi dential homes, and often they are there for short periods of time, to give their parents respite. Almost none of them are orphans. More energy is put into keeping children, if not with their mothers or fathers, then at least with supported relatives. More children are sent to foster families (which have had their share of scandals). By far the greater proportion of those in residential care are teenagers. Often they chose to be in homes rather than stay with foster parents - after all, they already have a family; they don't want another. The homes are much smaller than they used to be: the average number of children in each one is now seven. Many of the buildings no longer look like units. But, like most jobs that involve touching bodies, getting close to people, the staff are still paid disgraceful wages - a derisory \u00a312,080 a year is the salary on which someone in a home starts. Childcare should be a profession, esteemed and rewarded, like being a solicitor or a doctor. They are men and women who are picking up the pieces of lost childhoods. </p> <p>I visited a residential home in Walton on the Naze - one of the homes Essex Council is clearly most proud of. Down a lane on the edges of the seaside town, a handsome redbrick house with a large lawn, washing on the line, a radio playing loudly in one of the rooms upstairs, that overlooks the sea. It does not smell like an institution, that cabbage and polish and old sweat odour. No keys jangle off belts. The staff - almost all women - are friendly and welcoming. It is term-time, nearly the end of the school day. As I talk to the manager of the home, Sue, the young people who live here - six at the moment, though it can take up to nine - drift back. They squabble, throw their arms around Sue, demand to go shopping at once. It doesn't feel bureaucratic at all, though there are a number of strictly enforced rules ('boundaries'), like no sex within the home. 'Without clear boundaries and without consistency,' says Sue, 'their life is much scarier. They need to know where they are.' </p> <p>One of the girls takes me on a guided tour. In the sitting-room, she goes down on her bony knees and puts her hands, with their bitten fingernails, together and says: 'Don't take me away from here, don't let them close this place down. I'm safer here.' Then she shows me her room, where the clothes she has just bought are laid out on the bed. They are all allowed to decorate their rooms however they want. Some are neat, precise, everything in its right place. Others are in chaos, torn football posters on the wall and clothes everywhere. Each has a bathroom next to their room; a key so they can be alone and private. Each has an allowance, which they spend as they choose. They are encouraged to bring friends back from school. 'We try to make it absolutely as normal as we can,' says Sue. But of course it isn't normal. The teenagers here have been through terrible times; they feel a great deal of anger and grief. Some miss their parents a great deal; some are lonely, disturbed. </p> <p>'We are not their parents, nor should we ever pretend to be.' One of Sue's staff, a young man who grew up in the residential home his parents ran, adds that: 'They want home, of course they do, they rarely stop loving their parents no matter what - but they also know that the safe place and the best place for the time being is here. They know that to be back at home would be painful and maybe damaging to them.' </p> <p>Respect is the key word here. 'We work on respect,' says Sue. 'We respect the kids - or why should they respect us? When a young person arrives,' she continues, 'we draw up a 24-hour programme, with their help. For instance, we find out how they like to be woken up in the morning. The time that they are in their beds is a nightmare time for many of the children. You can shake them gently and they'll sit up and scream and punch you in the eye. So one of the boys, for instance, we decided with him that the best way was to tweak his toe. Then we find out how to open their bedroom door; what they like to drink in the morning, coffee or tea; sugar or not. What they like for breakfast. You have to give them choice and dignity. If a Martian landed and came here, he could read our files and know exactly how to treat each child.' </p> <p>'There's always a pattern to abuse,' says David. 'We have to find out what that pattern was so that we don't inadvertently repeat it. If I say to one of the guys, \"I'll run you a bath, do you want bubbles?\", that could be exactly what the abuser used to do. You've got to ask the young people. What do they want? What don't they want?' </p> <p>Sue adds: 'If you have a 6ft 6in teenager kicking the door in, you've got to be able to see that he's also a three-year-old who's feeling enormous pain and fear. He's become a child again, begging for attention and you have to see that and deal with it intelligently. When they call me an old fat cow, I know they don't mean it, they mean I'm hurting like hell here. Inside, they're little - there's a damaged little person in need of help. I remember every single child I've ever looked after, and I worry about all of them, and, of course, not all of them are all right. But you can change things,' she says. 'You can chip away. It can take months and months to move a fraction. We never give up here. And the children are heroes - my little heroes.' </p> <p>Sue believes that every child should have an advocate, which is also what many children's groups want, as they made clear after the Waterhouse Report was released. 'The best protection for children,' said the chief executive of Child in Care, 'is to empower them to speak up.' </p> <p>One of the most nightmarish aspects of what happened in Welsh homes is that victims did go to staff, but they were not listened to. Guy Cave is an NSPCC-managed child advocate in Croydon. His job, he says, is not to speak up for the young people, but to help them find their own voices. The Croydon Children and Young People's Rights Service that he runs has been named, by the young people themselves, Respect. It has made up 10 commandments for social workers, which include obvious rules, such as 'social workers should keep their promises'. Guy Cave says that he has heard social workers saying things to a young person like: 'I have got other cases, you know.' </p> <p>'Part of my job is a kind of assertiveness training and not just over things like abuse,' says Cave. 'For instance, one young person went from a foster home to a residential home, and he wasn't allowed back to collect his photographs. That may seem a little thing, but photographs can be powerful possessions for them. I'm not like a social worker. I am not doing what I think is best for them. I don't make that judgment. I am helping them to say what they think is best for themselves. I am helping them to find a voice. Often, young people in care are silent. We never hear from them, only occasionally about them. They have stories to tell and their stories aren't listened to.' </p> <p>A few days later, I met up with a group of young people who live, or have lived, in residential homes in London. They decided they wanted to go to an American-style restaurant in Soho. When I told them that they could eat whatever they wanted, they looked at me as if I came from another world. 'More than one course? Two courses?' 'Three!' I said. 'As much as you want.' </p> <p>They ordered platters of spicy chicken wings, giant steaks, baskets of chips, great goblets of ice-cream sundaes with chocolate fudge sauce. They smoked like chimneys and giggled. They told me stories - fragments of their own stories...</p> <p><strong>Eileen's story</strong></p> <p>My mum and dad divorced when I was six or seven. Then it was just me and my mum. She was always an aggressive drinker, an aggressive person. I felt safer with my dad. But I did love her. I thought one day she'd stop and everything would be all right. I was very scared as a child. I knew other people had it better, but I sort of didn't realise it fully. It was just normal, to be scared all the time. I guess I had no real childhood. She was beating me all the time, knocking me round the room, saying she was going to kill me, kill herself, there'd be foam coming out of her mouth. When I was 12 , I had a kind of wake-up call. I realised it wasn't going to stop. I started running away. I'd sleep in parks and things. Then I went and put myself voluntarily in care. It was weird, but when I arrived in the home, I felt free for the first time. But then they sent me back to her, to try again. She tried to kill herself. So I went back into care. I was 14 when I got pregnant, 15 when I became a mother. People think that's terrible. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. My daughter saved me, brought me back from the edge. God knows what would have happened to me without her. She's my angel and my saviour. Now I have two daughters. I am not going to be like my mother. I'm going to protect my kids, be their friend. And I want to work with kids like me, because no one should be a kid like me. And I will do it.</p> <p><strong>Will's story</strong></p> <p>I'm the oldest of seven; most of us have different fathers. My mum was ill a lot when I was a child; in hospital a lot. She did care. But she couldn't cope, not when we were all there. She did her best. We were always moving around council estates. I had asthma badly. And I had trouble with my stepfathers - I used to be badly beaten up by one and locked in my room. If I ever see him again I'm going to kill him and get my own back for what he did. </p> <p>Then a friend of the family abused me sexually. He abused all of us kids. That's when I first went into care, and it was so dreadful, I was so lonely. I was very young - and I have to live with the fact that it was because of me that we all went, because I snitched, and if it wasn't for me they'd still be with Mum. I never really had a childhood; I was too busy looking after the others. The best time was living for three years with my foster family - that was the longest stretch of time I've ever stayed anywhere and they were good to me. </p> <p>I've not really had any education; I didn't used to care but now I do. I've been to 30 primary schools, a couple of secondary schools, more than 30 homes, hostels, foster families - you name it, I've lived in it. You name it, it's been done to me. That's the way life was. Now I feel sorry because sometimes I hear about what life is meant to be like for kids and I had none of that. But I love my mother. I don't blame her. One day I will get married and have kids of my own. </p> <p><strong>Clinton's story (Will's brother)</strong></p> <p>We were all abused. There are things I can't say - did Will say? I can't really speak about that. Well, I went into long-term care when I was eight. Before that, I was in and out. I started off with foster parents with Will and my sister. But they moved and couldn't take us with them. I liked them. Then we went to other foster parents and I hated it. I got the blame for everything. Their daughter's boyfriend kept hitting me. I used to get tied up in my room. I kept running away. It was awful. So I was sent to a home. It's better. Not good, though. There's a lot of bullying. People threaten to stab you if you don't give them cigarettes. I get bullied at school too, so I don't go there any more. Most of the time, I stay away. I go to the library. I get lonely a lot of the time, and think about other people's lives. I'd like someone to foster me again. I'm waiting for that.</p> <p><strong>Nizia's story</strong></p> <p>I can't really say about me. I'm not good at talking. I usually stay silent and other people talk about me. My mother died when I was five. I think she used to love me. I lived with my father in France. He didn't love me. He's never loved me. He sent me back here, to be taken into care. </p> <p>I didn't want foster-parents. I prefer to be in a home. I've got used to it. There have been people who have cared about me in their own way, but I don't think I've ever been loved. </p> <p>There must be something wrong with me. That's all. </p> <p><strong>Peter's story</strong></p> <p>My mum and dad didn't get on. When I was nine, my mum left. I didn't know where she was. I was really miserable because I loved her. My dad - he didn't beat me up, but he never liked me. I begged and begged and at 12 I went to my mum's. That was the best bit - the journey to be with her, thinking everything would be good again. But my stepdad didn't like me at all. He beat me up a lot and my mum didn't intervene. She said she didn't want to take sides. But I thought she was taking his side by not protecting me from him. Parents are supposed to protect you, aren't they? It was frightening and lonely and I got so low I couldn't say anything. I felt betrayed. I had been so happy to think that I'd be with her again. There was a day, a Thursday, when I was 14, when he beat me up again and I had bruises all over and I thought, right, that's it, I'm off. I wrote a letter saying: don't try to find me. Then I went to a friend's house and her mum got in touch with the social services. They sent me to my nan, but that didn't work out at all. They found me a foster-parent. I was supposed to stay for a weekend, while they sorted something out; then it turned into two more weeks; then another month. I ended up there on a permanent basis. I was really, really, really happy. They were kind to me. I liked my foster brother. Do you know what - I am lucky, aren't I? Lucky. It turned out perfect.</p> <p><strong>Tina's story</strong></p> <p> I was 12 when I went into care. Everything was a mess. My mum left when I was two; my dad beat her and she couldn't take us any more, but he beat us too, me and my brother. </p> <p>There wasn't sexual abuse. My dad beat us with his belt. I was covered in bruises. I sorted it out by running away when I was 11. </p> <p>I went to mum's - she used to send me a birthday card every year, so I knew her address. After all these years, nine years of never seeing her, I didn't know her. I had this photo of her, but she didn't look like that any more. </p> <p>I couldn't call her mum. She'd left me. She was a stranger. I couldn't tell her anything. And she was an alcoholic, like my dad. </p> <p>Well, we didn't get on and one day we had a big fight and she phoned the social workers and told them to take me away; she didn't want me. </p> <p>I went to a foster family, but I wanted to be allowed to go out and things and my foster mother was strict, and she sent me back. </p> <p>So I ended up in a children's home, a short stay unit. Then another home, with my sister. But me and my sister started arguing and they split us up. I was so upset. She was all I had left. Then I went to another home. </p> <p>In the end, they found a foster family for me and I stayed there until I was 16. We had our ups and downs, but we sorted them out. I was glad to be independent, though. </p> <p>I couldn't wait. I had a boyfriend, but he started beating me up, trying to strangle me. He's in a mental hospital now. I've left all that now - I work in the kitchens of a YMCA. </p> <p>Sometimes I think how my life seems to have gone like my parents' life - I always said if anyone hits me just once, I'd be gone. But I stayed and I stayed. </p> <p>Now I have to learn to be me, myself. I'll never live with anyone again. I'll never trust anyone. I'm on my own.</p>",

There was a boy I fell in love with, who had a chipped tooth and thick glasses and who never spoke, although everyone knew he could. Every month his mother would come to visit him, and for days after that he would stand at the front door, hour upon hour, waiting for her to come back again. I was young and foolish, and I thought I could love them all better (or even one of them), and, of course, I was wrong. And yet now - two decades and four children later - I look back on my time there and think I was also right. It was a respectable home, no scandals, no children beaten or buggered, but there wasn't much love around. The children lived in a unit. Their rooms all looked alike, same wallpaper on the wall, bobbly chenille bedspreads on narrow beds, fake pine wardrobes in the corner. Maybe a teddy, but precious little else that they could call their own. No photographs pinned up - of their families or of themselves. They all got up at the same time in the morning, and went to bed at the same time at night. They all had breakfast, lunch, dinner, sitting round a long table, and had to eat up no matter what it was. There was a rota for the bathrooms. At weekends, they had supervised activities - jigsaw time, painting time, football-on-the-patch-of-green-lawn time. Sometimes we went on outings, piling into a minibus with identical packed lunches. Everything was planned. Time was parcelled out. They didn't hang around with you, learning how to cook, or go shopping, or sit on your lap in front of the telly, or hang on to your legs while you chat with a friend, or have midnight feasts, or do any of the unplanned things that most children get to do. They didn't spend time one-to-one with an adult. They didn't have much opportunity to tell their own stories. Their lives were so threadbare and so dull. At bedtime, those of us on nights would tuck them in, like parents do with their own children, and kiss them goodnight and maybe sing them a song or read them a book. But we didn't hug them tight and tell them we loved them to bits, and we didn't notice that something was maybe troubling them and sit down to listen to what it was. Later, we didn't creep back to watch them as they slept; tuck the teddy back under their arm or pull the cover back under their chin. And the next night another substitute mother would be there instead, singing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' and looking at her watch, thinking of going back to her real home. Things have changed a lot since those days. Fewer children are in resi dential homes, and often they are there for short periods of time, to give their parents respite. Almost none of them are orphans. More energy is put into keeping children, if not with their mothers or fathers, then at least with supported relatives. More children are sent to foster families (which have had their share of scandals). By far the greater proportion of those in residential care are teenagers. Often they chose to be in homes rather than stay with foster parents - after all, they already have a family; they don't want another. The homes are much smaller than they used to be: the average number of children in each one is now seven. Many of the buildings no longer look like units. But, like most jobs that involve touching bodies, getting close to people, the staff are still paid disgraceful wages - a derisory \u00a312,080 a year is the salary on which someone in a home starts. Childcare should be a profession, esteemed and rewarded, like being a solicitor or a doctor. They are men and women who are picking up the pieces of lost childhoods. I visited a residential home in Walton on the Naze - one of the homes Essex Council is clearly most proud of. Down a lane on the edges of the seaside town, a handsome redbrick house with a large lawn, washing on the line, a radio playing loudly in one of the rooms upstairs, that overlooks the sea. It does not smell like an institution, that cabbage and polish and old sweat odour. No keys jangle off belts. The staff - almost all women - are friendly and welcoming. It is term-time, nearly the end of the school day. As I talk to the manager of the home, Sue, the young people who live here - six at the moment, though it can take up to nine - drift back. They squabble, throw their arms around Sue, demand to go shopping at once. It doesn't feel bureaucratic at all, though there are a number of strictly enforced rules ('boundaries'), like no sex within the home. 'Without clear boundaries and without consistency,' says Sue, 'their life is much scarier. They need to know where they are.' One of the girls takes me on a guided tour. In the sitting-room, she goes down on her bony knees and puts her hands, with their bitten fingernails, together and says: 'Don't take me away from here, don't let them close this place down. I'm safer here.' Then she shows me her room, where the clothes she has just bought are laid out on the bed. They are all allowed to decorate their rooms however they want. Some are neat, precise, everything in its right place. Others are in chaos, torn football posters on the wall and clothes everywhere. Each has a bathroom next to their room; a key so they can be alone and private. Each has an allowance, which they spend as they choose. They are encouraged to bring friends back from school. 'We try to make it absolutely as normal as we can,' says Sue. But of course it isn't normal. The teenagers here have been through terrible times; they feel a great deal of anger and grief. Some miss their parents a great deal; some are lonely, disturbed. 'We are not their parents, nor should we ever pretend to be.' One of Sue's staff, a young man who grew up in the residential home his parents ran, adds that: 'They want home, of course they do, they rarely stop loving their parents no matter what - but they also know that the safe place and the best place for the time being is here. They know that to be back at home would be painful and maybe damaging to them.' Respect is the key word here. 'We work on respect,' says Sue. 'We respect the kids - or why should they respect us? When a young person arrives,' she continues, 'we draw up a 24-hour programme, with their help. For instance, we find out how they like to be woken up in the morning. The time that they are in their beds is a nightmare time for many of the children. You can shake them gently and they'll sit up and scream and punch you in the eye. So one of the boys, for instance, we decided with him that the best way was to tweak his toe. Then we find out how to open their bedroom door; what they like to drink in the morning, coffee or tea; sugar or not. What they like for breakfast. You have to give them choice and dignity. If a Martian landed and came here, he could read our files and know exactly how to treat each child.' 'There's always a pattern to abuse,' says David. 'We have to find out what that pattern was so that we don't inadvertently repeat it. If I say to one of the guys, \"I'll run you a bath, do you want bubbles?\", that could be exactly what the abuser used to do. You've got to ask the young people. What do they want? What don't they want?' Sue adds: 'If you have a 6ft 6in teenager kicking the door in, you've got to be able to see that he's also a three-year-old who's feeling enormous pain and fear. He's become a child again, begging for attention and you have to see that and deal with it intelligently. When they call me an old fat cow, I know they don't mean it, they mean I'm hurting like hell here. Inside, they're little - there's a damaged little person in need of help. I remember every single child I've ever looked after, and I worry about all of them, and, of course, not all of them are all right. But you can change things,' she says. 'You can chip away. It can take months and months to move a fraction. We never give up here. And the children are heroes - my little heroes.' Sue believes that every child should have an advocate, which is also what many children's groups want, as they made clear after the Waterhouse Report was released. 'The best protection for children,' said the chief executive of Child in Care, 'is to empower them to speak up.' One of the most nightmarish aspects of what happened in Welsh homes is that victims did go to staff, but they were not listened to. Guy Cave is an NSPCC-managed child advocate in Croydon. His job, he says, is not to speak up for the young people, but to help them find their own voices. The Croydon Children and Young People's Rights Service that he runs has been named, by the young people themselves, Respect. It has made up 10 commandments for social workers, which include obvious rules, such as 'social workers should keep their promises'. Guy Cave says that he has heard social workers saying things to a young person like: 'I have got other cases, you know.' 'Part of my job is a kind of assertiveness training and not just over things like abuse,' says Cave. 'For instance, one young person went from a foster home to a residential home, and he wasn't allowed back to collect his photographs. That may seem a little thing, but photographs can be powerful possessions for them. I'm not like a social worker. I am not doing what I think is best for them. I don't make that judgment. I am helping them to say what they think is best for themselves. I am helping them to find a voice. Often, young people in care are silent. We never hear from them, only occasionally about them. They have stories to tell and their stories aren't listened to.' A few days later, I met up with a group of young people who live, or have lived, in residential homes in London. They decided they wanted to go to an American-style restaurant in Soho. When I told them that they could eat whatever they wanted, they looked at me as if I came from another world. 'More than one course? Two courses?' 'Three!' I said. 'As much as you want.' They ordered platters of spicy chicken wings, giant steaks, baskets of chips, great goblets of ice-cream sundaes with chocolate fudge sauce. They smoked like chimneys and giggled. They told me stories - fragments of their own stories... Eileen's story My mum and dad divorced when I was six or seven. Then it was just me and my mum. She was always an aggressive drinker, an aggressive person. I felt safer with my dad. But I did love her. I thought one day she'd stop and everything would be all right. I was very scared as a child. I knew other people had it better, but I sort of didn't realise it fully. It was just normal, to be scared all the time. I guess I had no real childhood. She was beating me all the time, knocking me round the room, saying she was going to kill me, kill herself, there'd be foam coming out of her mouth. When I was 12 , I had a kind of wake-up call. I realised it wasn't going to stop. I started running away. I'd sleep in parks and things. Then I went and put myself voluntarily in care. It was weird, but when I arrived in the home, I felt free for the first time. But then they sent me back to her, to try again. She tried to kill herself. So I went back into care. I was 14 when I got pregnant, 15 when I became a mother. People think that's terrible. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. My daughter saved me, brought me back from the edge. God knows what would have happened to me without her. She's my angel and my saviour. Now I have two daughters. I am not going to be like my mother. I'm going to protect my kids, be their friend. And I want to work with kids like me, because no one should be a kid like me. And I will do it. Will's story I'm the oldest of seven; most of us have different fathers. My mum was ill a lot when I was a child; in hospital a lot. She did care. But she couldn't cope, not when we were all there. She did her best. We were always moving around council estates. I had asthma badly. And I had trouble with my stepfathers - I used to be badly beaten up by one and locked in my room. If I ever see him again I'm going to kill him and get my own back for what he did. Then a friend of the family abused me sexually. He abused all of us kids. That's when I first went into care, and it was so dreadful, I was so lonely. I was very young - and I have to live with the fact that it was because of me that we all went, because I snitched, and if it wasn't for me they'd still be with Mum. I never really had a childhood; I was too busy looking after the others. The best time was living for three years with my foster family - that was the longest stretch of time I've ever stayed anywhere and they were good to me. I've not really had any education; I didn't used to care but now I do. I've been to 30 primary schools, a couple of secondary schools, more than 30 homes, hostels, foster families - you name it, I've lived in it. You name it, it's been done to me. That's the way life was. Now I feel sorry because sometimes I hear about what life is meant to be like for kids and I had none of that. But I love my mother. I don't blame her. One day I will get married and have kids of my own. Clinton's story (Will's brother) We were all abused. There are things I can't say - did Will say? I can't really speak about that. Well, I went into long-term care when I was eight. Before that, I was in and out. I started off with foster parents with Will and my sister. But they moved and couldn't take us with them. I liked them. Then we went to other foster parents and I hated it. I got the blame for everything. Their daughter's boyfriend kept hitting me. I used to get tied up in my room. I kept running away. It was awful. So I was sent to a home. It's better. Not good, though. There's a lot of bullying. People threaten to stab you if you don't give them cigarettes. I get bullied at school too, so I don't go there any more. Most of the time, I stay away. I go to the library. I get lonely a lot of the time, and think about other people's lives. I'd like someone to foster me again. I'm waiting for that. Nizia's story I can't really say about me. I'm not good at talking. I usually stay silent and other people talk about me. My mother died when I was five. I think she used to love me. I lived with my father in France. He didn't love me. He's never loved me. He sent me back here, to be taken into care. I didn't want foster-parents. I prefer to be in a home. I've got used to it. There have been people who have cared about me in their own way, but I don't think I've ever been loved. There must be something wrong with me. That's all. Peter's story My mum and dad didn't get on. When I was nine, my mum left. I didn't know where she was. I was really miserable because I loved her. My dad - he didn't beat me up, but he never liked me. I begged and begged and at 12 I went to my mum's. That was the best bit - the journey to be with her, thinking everything would be good again. But my stepdad didn't like me at all. He beat me up a lot and my mum didn't intervene. She said she didn't want to take sides. But I thought she was taking his side by not protecting me from him. Parents are supposed to protect you, aren't they? It was frightening and lonely and I got so low I couldn't say anything. I felt betrayed. I had been so happy to think that I'd be with her again. There was a day, a Thursday, when I was 14, when he beat me up again and I had bruises all over and I thought, right, that's it, I'm off. I wrote a letter saying: don't try to find me. Then I went to a friend's house and her mum got in touch with the social services. They sent me to my nan, but that didn't work out at all. They found me a foster-parent. I was supposed to stay for a weekend, while they sorted something out; then it turned into two more weeks; then another month. I ended up there on a permanent basis. I was really, really, really happy. They were kind to me. I liked my foster brother. Do you know what - I am lucky, aren't I? Lucky. It turned out perfect. Tina's story I was 12 when I went into care. Everything was a mess. My mum left when I was two; my dad beat her and she couldn't take us any more, but he beat us too, me and my brother. There wasn't sexual abuse. My dad beat us with his belt. I was covered in bruises. I sorted it out by running away when I was 11. I went to mum's - she used to send me a birthday card every year, so I knew her address. After all these years, nine years of never seeing her, I didn't know her. I had this photo of her, but she didn't look like that any more. I couldn't call her mum. She'd left me. She was a stranger. I couldn't tell her anything. And she was an alcoholic, like my dad. Well, we didn't get on and one day we had a big fight and she phoned the social workers and told them to take me away; she didn't want me. I went to a foster family, but I wanted to be allowed to go out and things and my foster mother was strict, and she sent me back. So I ended up in a children's home, a short stay unit. Then another home, with my sister. But me and my sister started arguing and they split us up. I was so upset. She was all I had left. Then I went to another home. In the end, they found a foster family for me and I stayed there until I was 16. We had our ups and downs, but we sorted them out. I was glad to be independent, though. I couldn't wait. I had a boyfriend, but he started beating me up, trying to strangle me. He's in a mental hospital now. I've left all that now - I work in the kitchens of a YMCA. Sometimes I think how my life seems to have gone like my parents' life - I always said if anyone hits me just once, I'd be gone. But I stayed and I stayed. Now I have to learn to be me, myself. I'll never live with anyone again. I'll never trust anyone. I'm on my own.",

      "body": "<p>When I was little, we used to go and stay with my great-auntie May and her husband Tom and I was struck by how much they enjoyed food. Breakfast toast was cooked on the fire in winter, and there would always be napkins, but not in a pretentious way. My mother was a good cook, too, but Auntie May gave me my burning desire to make food an enjoyable and loving thing. We always ate together as a family, and even if there's just the two of you, it's good to take even 10 minutes to eat together, rather than grabbing something from the fridge and eating it in front of the TV. </p> <p>One of the very first things I remember making was cheesecake at primary school - the gelatine went all into strands. But I was always in the kitchen with Mum, and I'd just cook instinctively, make things up. Even then I cared about food - laying a tray, not just plonking fruit and cheese on a board but adding grapes and walnuts - because that's what Auntie May used to do. The way food looks is very important - when I first went into private practice, I used to keep recipe books in my rooms to stimulate patients. I still don't really use them myself, although I love Claudia Roden - it's all so simple and her love of food shines through in her writing. </p> <p>As a teenager, I was interested in studying medicine, but I wanted to use food instead of drugs. My dad was a chemistry teacher and arranged for me to spend the day with a friend who was a dietician, an experience that encouraged me to do a dietetics degree at Leeds University. Unfortunately I hated it. It didn't live up to my expectations of using food in a passionate, healing and enjoyable way. </p> <p>Immediately afterwards, before going into practice as a dietician, I did a Cordon Bleu course to try and get some of the passion back. Being with people who wanted to cook with chocolate, or spending hours making filo pastry or Chelsea buns, just like Auntie May, was lovely. Now if I'm feeling really stressed, shopping for food and cooking is what really lifts me. A perfect day would start with going down to Borough Market, by the Thames, where there are lots of small specialist producers, seeing what I fancy and then spending the rest of the day cooking and having friends round. </p> <p>Making a risotto and having a glass of wine while you do it is heaven. I love the Spanish and Moroccan style of eating, too, with lots of little dishes - say, roasted onions with a rich tomato sauce, asparagus and a few olives - because I'm never satisfied with one taste. I also love picnics and last summer did a very big one for about 12 friends. We had poussin with preserved lemons and rosemary, and a sea bass in rock salt each, with loads of leafy salads and berries. Unfortunately, I couldn't have the strawberries, as my family is atopic, which means they have heightened sensitivity to certain allergens - some of them get eczema and hay fever, for example - but my particular allergy only emerged about 18 months ago. </p> <p>It was a bit of a joke at first. I'd slept badly, had a bit of a headache, and when I got up and looked in the mirror my face was all swollen - I looked as if I'd put a stone on overnight, but it went down with some anti-histamine and steroids. Over the next six months, I had about six or seven of these episodes, and eventually I identified that they were caused by tuna, salmon, strawberries and melon. Then I went to my Nana's funeral in Stoke-on-Trent and had a mouthful of salad that had salmon or tuna in it at lunch and went into full anaphylactic shock - my face and tongue swelled up and my blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate dropped. I was very lucky - my brother knew where the nearest hospital was and rushed me straight there - he literally saved my life. Now I carry adrenaline with me everywhere. </p> <p>As a practitioner, being a patient was an invaluable experience. That and seeing the way people I was close to were dealt with by the medical profession helped me decide to go into private practice, after a couple of years working in the NHS. There was no room within the NHS to listen to people, give them time and understand more about their life. We never asked patients, 'Which foods do you love?' but you can find out so much if you know what they crave - a child with lactose intolerance will crave dairy products, for example, because our bodies crave what they're not meant to have. You need to give people permission to enjoy what they can have, rather than focusing on what they think you are going to say they can't have. Women with migraines often crave orange juice in the mornings, but that may be exactly what triggers the problem, so I suggest mango instead. I offer patients a glass of wine at my practice so they can relax. As soon as they realise I am not a holier-than-thou woman in a white coat, it can work. </p> <p>One man, who had been diagnosed with high cholesterol levels six months earlier, came to see me at my practice with his fianc\u00e9e. He had put himself on a really strict cholesterol-free diet, refusing to eat in restaurants or at friends' houses. She just wanted to get back to some sort of normality. As we talked, he began to lighten up and I asked, 'How's your sex life?' They both went bright red and she said, 'How do you know?' I knew because if you bring your cholesterol level down really quickly, it interferes with your testosterone. We joked about it, and now he's eating a little butter and cheese with fruit or oatcakes to inhibit the absorption of the cholesterol. Some patients with high cholesterol are given lists of all the things they can't have by their doctors - no eggs and no seafood is often advised - but the truth is that while seafood contains cholesterol, it gets broken down and therefore doesn't raise blood cholesterol levels. </p> <p>I see a lot of people with cancer, some of whom have tried every other avenue and think I can make everything all right, but I can't. I can't stop people dying, that's one of the hardest parts of the job, but I can make their lives and their families' lives more enjoyable and positive. One man I looked after when I was working with HIV-positive people for the NHS in Nottingham was in his last few days. He could hardly eat anything but he loved talking about food - which restaurants I'd been to, what I'd had to eat. That was far better therapy than someone walking in with a drink in a box and saying, 'That's all you are allowed to eat.' </p> <p>More common complaints include waking up in the morning feeling that you haven't had a good night's rest, or coming home absolutely on your knees after work. I encourage these patients to have an afternoon snack, drink more water during the day, and eat more protein at lunch, which can keep mood and energy levels higher. </p> <p>I also see people with weight problems and some of them want to be put on a diet and told, 'This is what you have for lunch, this is what you have for supper.' That's not the way I work. I'll teach them about how their appetite mechanism works, concentrating on juggling tastes and textures, so they get the maximum satisfaction from eating. I can help, but they have to have the motivation and work out the lifestyle changes for themselves. The way we eat, rushing food without savouring it like the French or Italians, is one of the most difficult things to change. People who have irritated bowels or bad skin may be so stressed that they eat too quickly and their bodies can't get the goodness from their food. Eating more slowly, really tasting and enjoying your food and drinking more water to help the vitamins and minerals come out of the food are three basic things that I would recommend to everyone. </p> <p>Don't ask me what my favourite food or restaurant is - it depends on my mood. But I love Italian food, grilled vegetables and risotto, say, and I love cooking that for friends. I like to have something I can't eat at home and for that reason I love going to Lindsay House in Soho. If there's nothing I really fancy when I'm eating out, I just have a little bit of something and then eat when I get home. I'm not hugely fussy, but I would rather have a boiled egg and toast than go out for a kebab. I'm not passing judgement on that - it's just not part of my psyche. </p> <p>Of course, I really crave things - ooh yes, I love Kettle chips, especially the black- pepper ones, and peanuts, olives, snacking on a bit of chorizo sausage. My cravings have always been for salty things. A bar of chocolate can stay in my fridge for ages. I'll probably cook with it, and one of my favourite desserts is chocolate mousse. I think that's heaven. Sometimes people say that I talk about food as if I'm talking about sex. But food is a sensory thing - so why not?</p> <p>My mission is to encourage you to make the connection between what you put into your stomach and the way in which your life unfolds as a result. Having previously written two books - Bodyfoods for Women and Bodyfoods for Life - I thought it was time to explore eating habits more widely, to see how simple dishes and the way we put them together can help us tune into what our body needs. I hope that the following extracts from my new Bodyfoods Cookbook will inspire you to adopt delicious and nutritious eating habits that are both easy and achievable. I've kept things simple because you shouldn't have to hunt hard to find ingredients - you can hopefully find the ingredients to make everything from simple snacks to more exotic dinner party 'hits' in your local supermarket or delicatessen. The ingredients contained in every recipe have been included with the sole purpose of combining flavour with health-giving properties, but each recipe also features a 'magic ingredient', an ingredient that has a specific health-giving quality. </p> <p> <strong> Breakfast-time boosts</strong> </p> <p> Despite the saying 'Breakfast like a king, lunch like a knave and dine like a pauper', there is no hard-and-fast rule about when, or how much, you should eat. Instead, it's a question of understanding how your body responds to food and how you can maximise your wellbeing through eating. Breakfast provides an invaluable opportunity to enable you to do the latter. A bowl of fresh fruit salad eaten shortly after getting up, for example, will provide a slow release of energy to help you to get through the morning, as well as a good dose of vitamins and minerals. Scrambled eggs on toast, on the other hand, supply a dose of protein that goes towards building up your muscles, which is particularly necessary if you expend a lot of physical energy throughout the day. </p> <p>Everyone responds differently to food in the morning: some people feel sleepy and unable to function after eating a large breakfast, whereas others need a hearty breakfast before they embark upon the day's activities. Although there is a lot of confusion about the necessity of having breakfast as a result of these differing reactions, it is important to consider the scientific evidence. It has been proven that the body performs and feels better if you eat something (however little) between waking up and having lunch. Because you have had to rely on your body's nutrient reserves to keep you going overnight, the morning is the best time to start topping them up again. Scientific studies have furthermore shown that children who either skip breakfast or eat very little at the start of the day are at a disadvantage when compared with those who eat a healthy breakfast. This is because the brains of children who have empty stomachs tend to receive less than the ideal level of blood sugar. Although this doesn't mean that they're likely to keel over at any moment, certain parts of their memories may not work as well as they should, which may cause problems at school. Children who've breakfasted properly generally have better reaction times and are also more proficient at such problem-solving exercises as mental arithmetic (this is most apparent in children with lower IQs). </p> <p>A well-nourished brain can improve adults' ability to recall information, too, because it has received sufficient fuel (that is, sugar) to enable it to perform effectively. Before you start reaching for a sugar lump, however, you should understand that the sugar = brain-fuel formula is not that simple. For example, if you eat a sugar lump or gulp down a can of sweetened 'sports drink' first thing in the morning when you have an empty stomach, your blood-sugar level will shoot up, consequently stimulating your body to secrete a large amount of insulin (the hormone that transfers sugar from the blood to the body's cells). This insulin reaction will in turn cause your blood-sugar level to plummet, thus leaving your brain with very little sugar to work with. </p> <p>Instead, the best way in which to deliver sugar to your brain is to package it within a high-fibre, carbohydrate-rich food, such as wholemeal bread, wholegrain cereal, oats or fresh fruit. The fibre in such foods helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is released into the blood and carried to the brain, thereby enabling you to remain focused. </p> <p>The wide range of high-fibre, carbohydrate-rich foods offers you flexibility and choice at breakfast time. If time is short in the morning, how about a pur\u00e9ed fruit drink, such as a banana and pineapple smoothie? Smoothies (pur\u00e9ed fruit drinks) are ideal breakfasts, being both quick to make and containing energising properties. They are also a good way in which to give children a vitamin boost at the beginning of the day. Refreshing and revitalising drinks, they can be made with various combinations of fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, apricots, peaches and other seasonal fruits, with or without added yogurt. Try adding a few baked fruits or a spoonful of pur\u00e9ed fruit to smoothies, as these give a slightly different texture. This breakfast can be eaten at home, as well as at the gym after a work-out, or after you've arrived at the office. </p> <p>If your early mornings are not so rushed, relaxing over a wild-mushroom omelette with fresh herbs is a highly effective way in which to prepare yourself for some productive hours. However, pregnant women and people who have compromised immune systems should avoid eating undercooked and soft-boiled eggs. Although children under the age of eight or nine months can eat cooked egg yolks, egg whites are more challenging to a young gut, so you should wait until your children are a year old before feeding them eggs. Remember that breakfast doesn't have to be eaten at a set time each day, although you should try to have something within a couple of hours of getting up. Another good reason why you should eat a little something in the morning is because your digestive system performs much more efficiently if it is allowed to work on a small amount of food every few hours. </p> <p><strong> Long and short lunches</strong> </p> <p> Lunches have changed over the past 50 years. Gone are the days when we stopped work for a couple of hours and went home to tuck into the substantial main meal of the day. By contrast, today it's more often a question of making a quick dash to the sandwich shop and then hastily consuming our purchase while working, or perhaps worse still, having a couple of mouthfuls of the children's left-overs, followed by a quick cup of coffee and a chocolate biscuit. For many of us, taking the time to have lunch seems like too much of an indulgence, one that we save for the weekend, when we can afford the time and can also cope better with the sleepy feelings that we frequently experience when our stomachs are full. </p> <p>If we choose the foods that suit our bodies, lunch should provide the perfect opportunity to supply ourselves with nutritional, energising fuel. Yet many people don't like to take a food break in the middle of the day because they end up feeling far from energised, wanting instead to crawl into bed for a catnap. Because we lead demanding, highly stressed lives, we want and need to feel alert, not sleepy, during the afternoon. </p> <p>What many of us don't realise, however, is that the type of food that we eat, as well as the manner in which we eat it, influences how we feel. For instance, pasta, bread and other starchy foods encourage the brain to produce sleep-inducing hormones. This happens because these foods need to be digested slowly, which means that the stomach and digestive system (which is, after all, a muscle) require oxygen to perform their duties efficiently. The brain therefore secretes hormones that encourage us to sleep in order to diminish both our desire and physiological ability to divert oxygen from our stomach to our limbs to enable us to rush around. If we ignore the effect of these hormones, however, and instead command our limbs to move energetically, oxygen is diverted from the stomach, which frequently leads to indigestion, stomach cramps and bloating. </p> <p>In short, the brain's response to these starchy foods is one that is conditioned by physiological efficiency. If you have time to take a siesta after lunch, perhaps at the weekend, then by all means go ahead and make a dish like my pasta with courgettes and lemon or baby potatoes topped with guacamole and roasted peppers; eating these foods and then having a little snooze is the best way to allow your body to enjoy and digest them. If you don't have the time, however, choose a protein, fruit and vegetable-based lunch in which the proportion of vegetables, fruits and/or protein is high, such as my asparagus and lemon salad, a bowl of courgette and pea soup or a chunk of cheese with some figs, grapes and crisp, green celery. By opting for such foods, your body's hormonal response will encourage, not hinder, your desire to be energetic in the afternoon. </p> <p>There is a further benefit of having a protein-rich lunch, too. Proteins are made up of amino acids, two of which, L-phenylalanine and tryptophan, encourage the body to produce endorphins (mood-enhancing hormones). Eating a protein-rich lunch, like my sea bass with crab, chicken Caesar salad or some lean charcuterie with cherry tomatoes, therefore not only helps to prevent the mood swings that may occur mid-afternoon, but also enables your body's blood-sugar levels to remain more constant (which means that you shouldn't experience 'sugar dips' at 4pm). If eating protein-rich foods doesn't appeal to you, having a fruit- or vegetable-based lunch, like a bowl of soup followed by some fruit, can similarly energise your body. </p> <p>If you are organised and a little eclectic in your thinking, you can turn lunch into an interesting affair, rather than settling for the which-sandwich-bores-me-least? option. Practicality is usually a big issue, which is why sandwich bars may initially appear to be your only resort as a convenient source of lunch, but why not make a large cauldron of soup or a tray of grilled vegetables at home at the weekend to take to work in small plastic containers and then heat them up in the microwave at work (if your office has one)? Alternatively, if for reasons of practicality or preference, bread is your staple food for lunch, remember that you don't have to stick to the traditional sandwich made up of two slices of sliced bread with something in the middle. </p> <p>Many different, mouth-watering types of breads are readily available today, such as ciabatta, focaccia or flat bread, which you can either make into wraps or warm up and eat with dips and crudit\u00e9s; muffins, too, can be topped or filled with lean, protein-rich foods and salads. In order to vary its texture and taste, you could also toast some bread to serve with a bowl of hearty soup, while an open focaccia sandwich like my focaccia with chargrilled peppers and ham will show off its topping in a gloriously sensory-stimulating manner. </p> <p>Turn lunch into a delightful, energising interlude in the middle of what would otherwise be a hectic, draining day. Half an hour or so is plenty of time in which to eat something nutritious and delicious, and taking a break will also allow you to step back from your busy routine for a while and refresh both your body and mind.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/departments/houseandgarden/story/0,6000,341331,00.html\">Read Jane Clarke's Bodyfood recipes here</a></p> <p> <strong> Next week</strong> sustaining suppers, ideas for entertaining, plus, coping with insomnia, and how to improve your sex life. </p> <p>\u0095 The above text is excerpted from Jane Clarke's Bodyfoods Cookbook (Cassell &amp; Co, \u00a318.99).</p>",

This insulin reaction will in turn cause your blood-sugar level to plummet, thus leaving your brain with very little sugar to work with. Instead, the best way in which to deliver sugar to your brain is to package it within a high-fibre, carbohydrate-rich food, such as wholemeal bread, wholegrain cereal, oats or fresh fruit. The fibre in such foods helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is released into the blood and carried to the brain, thereby enabling you to remain focused. The wide range of high-fibre, carbohydrate-rich foods offers you flexibility and choice at breakfast time. If time is short in the morning, how about a pur\u00e9ed fruit drink, such as a banana and pineapple smoothie? Smoothies (pur\u00e9ed fruit drinks) are ideal breakfasts, being both quick to make and containing energising properties. They are also a good way in which to give children a vitamin boost at the beginning of the day. Refreshing and revitalising drinks, they can be made with various combinations of fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, apricots, peaches and other seasonal fruits, with or without added yogurt. Try adding a few baked fruits or a spoonful of pur\u00e9ed fruit to smoothies, as these give a slightly different texture. This breakfast can be eaten at home, as well as at the gym after a work-out, or after you've arrived at the office. If your early mornings are not so rushed, relaxing over a wild-mushroom omelette with fresh herbs is a highly effective way in which to prepare yourself for some productive hours. However, pregnant women and people who have compromised immune systems should avoid eating undercooked and soft-boiled eggs. Although children under the age of eight or nine months can eat cooked egg yolks, egg whites are more challenging to a young gut, so you should wait until your children are a year old before feeding them eggs. Remember that breakfast doesn't have to be eaten at a set time each day, although you should try to have something within a couple of hours of getting up. Another good reason why you should eat a little something in the morning is because your digestive system performs much more efficiently if it is allowed to work on a small amount of food every few hours. Long and short lunches Lunches have changed over the past 50 years. Gone are the days when we stopped work for a couple of hours and went home to tuck into the substantial main meal of the day. By contrast, today it's more often a question of making a quick dash to the sandwich shop and then hastily consuming our purchase while working, or perhaps worse still, having a couple of mouthfuls of the children's left-overs, followed by a quick cup of coffee and a chocolate biscuit. For many of us, taking the time to have lunch seems like too much of an indulgence, one that we save for the weekend, when we can afford the time and can also cope better with the sleepy feelings that we frequently experience when our stomachs are full. If we choose the foods that suit our bodies, lunch should provide the perfect opportunity to supply ourselves with nutritional, energising fuel. Yet many people don't like to take a food break in the middle of the day because they end up feeling far from energised, wanting instead to crawl into bed for a catnap. Because we lead demanding, highly stressed lives, we want and need to feel alert, not sleepy, during the afternoon. What many of us don't realise, however, is that the type of food that we eat, as well as the manner in which we eat it, influences how we feel. For instance, pasta, bread and other starchy foods encourage the brain to produce sleep-inducing hormones. This happens because these foods need to be digested slowly, which means that the stomach and digestive system (which is, after all, a muscle) require oxygen to perform their duties efficiently. The brain therefore secretes hormones that encourage us to sleep in order to diminish both our desire and physiological ability to divert oxygen from our stomach to our limbs to enable us to rush around. If we ignore the effect of these hormones, however, and instead command our limbs to move energetically, oxygen is diverted from the stomach, which frequently leads to indigestion, stomach cramps and bloating. In short, the brain's response to these starchy foods is one that is conditioned by physiological efficiency. If you have time to take a siesta after lunch, perhaps at the weekend, then by all means go ahead and make a dish like my pasta with courgettes and lemon or baby potatoes topped with guacamole and roasted peppers; eating these foods and then having a little snooze is the best way to allow your body to enjoy and digest them. If you don't have the time, however, choose a protein, fruit and vegetable-based lunch in which the proportion of vegetables, fruits and/or protein is high, such as my asparagus and lemon salad, a bowl of courgette and pea soup or a chunk of cheese with some figs, grapes and crisp, green celery. By opting for such foods, your body's hormonal response will encourage, not hinder, your desire to be energetic in the afternoon. There is a further benefit of having a protein-rich lunch, too. Proteins are made up of amino acids, two of which, L-phenylalanine and tryptophan, encourage the body to produce endorphins (mood-enhancing hormones). Eating a protein-rich lunch, like my sea bass with crab, chicken Caesar salad or some lean charcuterie with cherry tomatoes, therefore not only helps to prevent the mood swings that may occur mid-afternoon, but also enables your body's blood-sugar levels to remain more constant (which means that you shouldn't experience 'sugar dips' at 4pm). If eating protein-rich foods doesn't appeal to you, having a fruit- or vegetable-based lunch, like a bowl of soup followed by some fruit, can similarly energise your body. If you are organised and a little eclectic in your thinking, you can turn lunch into an interesting affair, rather than settling for the which-sandwich-bores-me-least? option. Practicality is usually a big issue, which is why sandwich bars may initially appear to be your only resort as a convenient source of lunch, but why not make a large cauldron of soup or a tray of grilled vegetables at home at the weekend to take to work in small plastic containers and then heat them up in the microwave at work (if your office has one)? Alternatively, if for reasons of practicality or preference, bread is your staple food for lunch, remember that you don't have to stick to the traditional sandwich made up of two slices of sliced bread with something in the middle. Many different, mouth-watering types of breads are readily available today, such as ciabatta, focaccia or flat bread, which you can either make into wraps or warm up and eat with dips and crudit\u00e9s; muffins, too, can be topped or filled with lean, protein-rich foods and salads. In order to vary its texture and taste, you could also toast some bread to serve with a bowl of hearty soup, while an open focaccia sandwich like my focaccia with chargrilled peppers and ham will show off its topping in a gloriously sensory-stimulating manner. Turn lunch into a delightful, energising interlude in the middle of what would otherwise be a hectic, draining day. Half an hour or so is plenty of time in which to eat something nutritious and delicious, and taking a break will also allow you to step back from your busy routine for a while and refresh both your body and mind.

Its closest recent rivals in my mind are Hermione Lee's life of Virginia Woolf and Judith Thurman's Colette. In all three instances, the biographer is in close sympathy with his or her quirky subject, has mastered the extremely complex social and literary surround and takes an intuitive, writerly interest in the subject's fiction. These are biographers who are imposingly erudite but never pedantic. They plunge us into the richly detailed world of their subjects. </p> <p>None of the three is the first biographer, just the best. If Tadi\u00e9 is my favourite, it is because he corrects misleading impressions about Proust that have accumulated over the years and achieves an extraordinarily balanced account of his elusive genius. </p> <p>I don't like 'creative' biographies in which the biographer appears as a chatty character in a story that he never witnessed. Nor do I like Freudian reckonings (psychobiography seems to be the last refuge of psychoanalytic theory), books in which the subject's entire life is reduced to a single childhood wound. I'm horrified by biographies that present pure speculations about motives as certainties in sentences that begin with the word 'doubtless' or even 'indisputably'. </p> <p>Jean Yves Tadi\u00e9 is refreshingly sensible in this regard. For instance, in a discussion of Proust's celebrated asthma, which reduced him to an invalid's life and played a determining role in his vocation as a writer, Tadi\u00e9 remarks: </p> <p>\"People put too much emphasis on the unconscious, but what is an unconscious that does not make itself felt? One is reduced to speculations based on mere probability: 'He can't fail to have had...' People have gone so far as to have attributed Marcel's first asthma attack at age nine to the fact that his brother had stopped wearing childhood dresses, thereby going from the state of 'little girl' to that of a boy, 'a serious rival for the conquest of their mother's affection'. These childhood dresses, the customary clothes of the period, no more suggested that their wearer was a girl than a Scotsman's kilt means that he is a woman.' [I've retranslated parts of this passage for the sake of emphasis and clarity.]\"</p> <p>Tadi\u00e9's life of Proust gives us all the truth and nothing but the truth, as well as a wealth of ancillary information about the impressive cast of characters around the great writer, who turns out to be the reigning (if least typical) artist of last century. Tadi\u00e9 - the foremost living expert on Proust's manuscripts - foregoes a sweeping, integrated narrative and contents himself with short sections, each just a few pages long and under a separate heading, although all are arranged in roughly chronological order (thus for the first decade of the twentieth century there are headings such as 'Daily Life', 'Social Gatherings' and 'Literary Work'). </p> <p>The modesty of this arrangement is a frank admission that this biography will not read like a popular romance - which I, for one, find reassuring, since I'm convinced real life lacks narrative drive. Although I can be forced against my inclinations to admit that all biographical accounts are artificial and selective and nothing but versions of the truth, nevertheless I'd still insist that some versions are much truer than others.</p> <p>Tadi\u00e9's Way is the straightest, truest path I know of. It's also remarkably efficient. Even though the biography is about half as long as Proust's masterpiece itself, it still manages to pack in facts, judgments and interpretations on every aspect of Proust's life and talent in a condensed but never obscure prose. Scholars will be battening on the footnotes for years to come. </p> <p>Proust's life was peculiarly uneventful in the worldly sense - no long, unusual voyages, no historically significant meetings, no recorded heart-wrenching amorous scenes. Proust himself was dismissive of the world's way of measuring significance. He found more profit and pleasure in his trips outside Paris to see various Gothic cathedrals than most travellers would experience in the Himalayas. He did meet James Joyce but was unable to communicate with him, and in any event accorded no importance to evenings spent with distinguished colleagues.</p> <p>Of course, he did have heart-wrenching homosexual love affairs, but he was too closeted to acknowledge them in his fiction or correspondence. As Tadi\u00e9 puts it, Proust had discovered that 'the truth of art lies not in the object but in the mind; yet it is only certain things, the privileged subjects, that compel the mind to create, and which inspire a spiritual joy'. </p> <p>Tadi\u00e9 makes neither too much nor too little of Proust's homosexuality. Reactionaries such as the US Proustian Roger Shattuck fear that dwelling on Proust's sexuality at all might reduce the 'universality' of his message. Tadi\u00e9, by contrast, deals quietly with each sexual and emotional involvement in Proust's life. He doesn't lump them together but takes them up individually, just as one would treat comparable heterosexual affairs in writing another life. Nor does he inflate the importance of a Platonic heterosexual dalliance, as George Painter did with Proust or as Steegmuller did with Cocteau (Steegmuller pretends that the great love of Cocteau's life was the Princess Paley). </p> <p>Whereas Painter's amusing two-volume biography of the 1960s, the standard life of Proust until now, relied almost exclusively on memoirs by Proust's contemporaries, Tadi\u00e9's book benefits from a whole library of subsequent scholarship, including the publication of twenty-some volumes of correspondence.</p> <p>Tadi\u00e9 has made a thorough study of Proust's manuscripts as the editor of the four-volume Pl\u00e9iade edition of A la Recherche du Temps Perdu and of six volumes of Etudes Proustiennes. This knowledge allows him to trace the development of Proustian themes and reconstruct how Proust wrote his book, step by step. Never was a life and its literary expression so interwoven as in Proust's case, and Tadi\u00e9 has had the patience and scholarship necessary for teasing out all the connections (though, unlike Painter, he never turns Proust's novel into a straightforward roman \u00e0 clef). Again and again Tadi\u00e9 reveals how Proust transformed his material; for instance, he shows how the salon conversation of his day gained in depth by being analysed and parodied in Proust's fiction. </p> <p>Tadi\u00e9 is a sophisticated writer with an international outlook; he taught at the University of Cairo for years and was at All Souls from 1988 to 1991. He demonstrates Proust's debt to George Eliot, Robert Louis Stevenson and Ruskin (whom he translated).Tadi\u00e9 also has a total grasp of the French artistic geography of the time. For instance, he indicates how Proust, by joining Anatole France's camp, earned the enmity of Mallarm\u00e9 and his followers, Val\u00e9ry, Gide and Claudel.</p> <p>Tadi\u00e9 is crystal clear about the disappointing reception of Proust's first book, Les Plaisirs et les Jours, which sold just 329 copies in its first 22 years of publication. Tadi\u00e9 explains convincingly why Proust abandoned his first novel, Jean Santeuil, the reason being that he broke off his passionate involvement with Reynaldo Hahn, the young composer for whom he was writing it.</p> <p>Tadi\u00e9 rejects the vulgar notion that Proust defended Dreyfus because he was half-Jewish and argues that Proust did not think of himself as a Jew (he and his brother were baptised Catholics, though his Christian-born father was an atheist in the best Positivist tradition of late nineteenth-century scientists). Moreover, if Proust had identified with other Jews, that would have been all the more reason at the time to stay silent on Dreyfus, whereas Proust was one of the most outspoken champions of the falsely accused soldier. </p> <p>Every page produces a new trouvaille. Tadi\u00e9 distinguishes between the usual wise-cracking sense of humour in literature and Proust's brand, which discovers the comic essence in each circumstance in life. On the subject of humour, we learn that Proust and the poet Anna de Noailles were invited everywhere not because they were talented but because they were the funniest pair in Paris. We hear one of Proust's quips after another, and we are given one of the first and clearest formulations of Proust's Law: 'Everything comes about just as we desired, but only when we no longer desire it' (in a letter sent during the summer of 1903 and reprinted in Volume 3 of the complete correspondence). </p> <p>Perhaps Tadi\u00e9's biography assumes the reader has already read Proust's novel and is imbued with Proustian lore. Tadi\u00e9's book does not have the journalistic skill to create an interest where none existed previously. But for dedicated Proustians this biography will become their bible.</p>",

He is also one of its contradictions. Identified with large theatrical institutions, he speaks up for small companies and intimate spaces. Knighted for services to the theatre, he has been forthright in attacking the arts policies of successive governments. </p> <p>New Labour comes in for a drubbing in Hall's new book. <strong> Exposed by the Mask</strong>, essays delivered at Trinity College, Cambridge, contains illuminating passages about theatre spaces ('practically every major theatre built in the last 50 years is too big'), the dead weight of naturalism, and a keen analysis of the speaking of Shakespearean verse. Hall falls back on a jargon - 'challenge, disturb, provoke' - which makes theatre-going sound like a moral duty. But when he flares up against his nightmare vision of the theatre of the future - 'a computer-driven populist miracle of lasers and acrobats' - he is completely persuasive. </p> <p>As with his productions, so with the man: Hall moves from the conventional to the bold. It is not easy to imagine what English theatrical life was like before he got going in the Fifties, when the great subsidised pillars of the dramatic establishment weren't in place. He founded the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford and London. He launched the National Theatre on London's South Bank when he took over from Laurence Olivier as director. </p> <p>It is for these achievements that Hall will chiefly be celebrated. And he's had plenty of opportunity to demonstrate his flair in the choice of repertoires and colleagues. Within his first five years at the RSC, Vanessa Redgrave had created her Rosalind, Peter Brook had directed Paul Scofield as Lear, Hall himself had staged Pinter's The Homecoming and directed David Warner in Hamlet. And it was Hall who brought Beckett to Britain when he staged Waiting for Godot at the small Arts Theatre in 1955. </p> <p>His professional life might be supposed to have been a glide from Cambridge to Stratford, Covent Garden and Glyndebourne. But <strong> Making An Exhibition of Myself</strong>, the autobiography first published seven years ago, tells the bumpy story behind the successes: an infancy as the precocious, ukulele-playing son of an East Anglian stationmaster; an ambitious youth (he decided he wanted to run Stratford at 16), suicidal thoughts and four wives. </p> <p>The <strong> Diaries</strong> he kept in the Seventies are a detailed chronicle of other difficulties, to do with the National's early days: policy twists (the idea of amalgamating the RSC and the National recurs), financial worries, a rancorous press. There is Hall chewing over problems with Trevor (Nunn), listening to stories from Harold (Pinter) and watching productions by Richard (Eyre). </p> <p>Hall has good stories to tell, both in the diaries and the autobiography.

He is also one of its contradictions. Identified with large theatrical institutions, he speaks up for small companies and intimate spaces. Knighted for services to the theatre, he has been forthright in attacking the arts policies of successive governments. New Labour comes in for a drubbing in Hall's new book. Exposed by the Mask, essays delivered at Trinity College, Cambridge, contains illuminating passages about theatre spaces ('practically every major theatre built in the last 50 years is too big'), the dead weight of naturalism, and a keen analysis of the speaking of Shakespearean verse. Hall falls back on a jargon - 'challenge, disturb, provoke' - which makes theatre-going sound like a moral duty. But when he flares up against his nightmare vision of the theatre of the future - 'a computer-driven populist miracle of lasers and acrobats' - he is completely persuasive. As with his productions, so with the man: Hall moves from the conventional to the bold. It is not easy to imagine what English theatrical life was like before he got going in the Fifties, when the great subsidised pillars of the dramatic establishment weren't in place. He founded the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford and London. He launched the National Theatre on London's South Bank when he took over from Laurence Olivier as director. It is for these achievements that Hall will chiefly be celebrated. And he's had plenty of opportunity to demonstrate his flair in the choice of repertoires and colleagues. Within his first five years at the RSC, Vanessa Redgrave had created her Rosalind, Peter Brook had directed Paul Scofield as Lear, Hall himself had staged Pinter's The Homecoming and directed David Warner in Hamlet. And it was Hall who brought Beckett to Britain when he staged Waiting for Godot at the small Arts Theatre in 1955. His professional life might be supposed to have been a glide from Cambridge to Stratford, Covent Garden and Glyndebourne. But Making An Exhibition of Myself, the autobiography first published seven years ago, tells the bumpy story behind the successes: an infancy as the precocious, ukulele-playing son of an East Anglian stationmaster; an ambitious youth (he decided he wanted to run Stratford at 16), suicidal thoughts and four wives. The Diaries he kept in the Seventies are a detailed chronicle of other difficulties, to do with the National's early days: policy twists (the idea of amalgamating the RSC and the National recurs), financial worries, a rancorous press. There is Hall chewing over problems with Trevor (Nunn), listening to stories from Harold (Pinter) and watching productions by Richard (Eyre). Hall has good stories to tell, both in the diaries and the autobiography. Princess Margaret says she can't understand why people are grumbling about the incomprehensible East Anglian accents in Hall's film of Akenfield: 'Though, of course, one did grow up there, in Norfolk at any rate.' Albert Finney discovers that while he was addressing the Ghost as Hamlet, his own father was dying.

The occasional lover of eighteenth-century novels who wants to go a little further; academic feminist enthusiasts of her late, rambling, political work The Wanderer, and precious few others. These days, she appears mostly on the edge of the photograph - the shy, watchful young woman with Dr Johnson at the Thraleses'; the journalistic observer of Napoleon; the unwilling courtier who was present throughout George III's 'mad business'. </p> <p>Many readers know her best for a single, uncharacteristic and horribly vivid description of having a cancerous breast removed without anaesthetic, a piece of icy, yet clear writing infinitely more terrifying than anything written by the entire school of gothic horror novelists. </p> <p>This relative obscurity would astound her contemporaries. Burney's first novel, Evelina, is a brilliant work still, a sharp, hard epistolary novel which is better than anything by Richardson and compares well with Fielding or Smollett. Her second and third, Cecilia and Camilla, are too long but still readable, while her comedies, which never found an audience at the time, are currently being rediscovered. Then, of course, there are her massive diaries and letters, an essential source for anyone interested in the turn from the eighteenth-century mind towards the age of Victoria. </p> <p>She was a superstar of literary London who, in her heyday, enthralled the reading public, was admired by such formidable intelligences as Johnson and Burke and whose influence on Jane Austen, Thackeray and even Dickens is indisputable. </p> <p>Beyond that, she lived an extraordinary life, growing up amid talented siblings (one sister was a musical child prodigy only outshone by a pint-sized Mozart and a brother sailed with Cook on his fatal voyage to Hawaii) before her literary glory, her incarceration at court, her late marriage to a refugee French soldier and her long exile in Paris, until she returned home, living until 1840, a curiosity for Sir Walter Scott to visit and Macaulay to revile. </p> <p>Her story is gripping but it is melancholy. The slaughter of siblings, cousins, children, friends that was the lot of so many eighteenth-century families is part of it. The Burneys had their share of family humiliations and reverses, black sheep and missed opportunities. But the core problem for a biographer is that Fanny herself went off. She almost wilfully destroyed her early promise and emerges, in old age, as a pretty unattractive character. </p> <p>This really, is the nub of the Burney problem and has a lot to do with her gender. Born into the coarse, robustly male world of the Enlightenment, into a family poor enough to struggle for its status, she was constantly and anxiously torn between feeding her genius and finding a place which would please her father and secure her position in 'society'. </p> <p>This was too early for the heroic unconventionalism of a George Eliot; Burney had no female predecessors to refer to and lived in the anxious middle ground between wealth and poverty, a place many unattached male writers could inhabit happily enough, but a much harder terrain for a single woman of modest means. </p> <p>Novel writing, she felt, was not quite respectable and she felt unable to turn down Queen Charlotte's offer to join the royal household at Windsor, a hideous life of exhausting routine idleness and gossip; there is a sad description of her last walk from outside life to the palace, almost unable to breathe. But after five years she did escape and before long, in one of the gayest passages in her life, unexpectedly married a penniless French \u00e9migr\u00e9 and officer, Alexandre d'Arblay, who emerges from this book as an engaging, kind, feckless man and a hilariously unbellicose soldier, like someone out of Tristram Shandy. He undoubtedly gave her her happiest years but when he died, Fanny's descent into a quavering mummifier of reputations and preserver of decency began. </p> <p>This tough, observant and vastly talented woman decayed into a prudish, fluffy, prolix moralist, a censorious bore, an obsessive rewriter of her family's dubious history. The hard-edged observer of eighteenth-century life becomes a nineteenth-century prig. </p> <p>Oh yes, and she lied. Claire Harman reviews the evidence on Burney's reshaping of the truth about her father, whose second marriage badly wounded his children and who never quite managed the literary status he craved, and incidents from her own life, including a semi-farcical near drowning (or not). Peeling back the layers of polite deceit is not easy, but has been done expertly and the result is not pretty. She was a comprehensive sanitiser, a Bowdler of her own life. </p> <p>This particular problem of unpeeling and exposing has been well dealt with by Harman - quite quickly, the reader trusts her fairness and judgment on genuinely tricky questions - but it leads to a second problem. Fanny was admirable in many ways, tough and brave, resourceful and hugely intelligent... but by late middle age, at least, she was not likeable, certainly not if one has had to wade through her interminable late prose. </p> <p>The sadness of her life, and this book, is that the young Fanny, cool and observant though she was, obsessed with her father's good opinion though she was, is nevertheless genuinely attractive in a Jane Austenish way, the miss who misses nothing, though without the greater writer's towering intelligence and merciless eye. In a sense, Jane Austen was Fanny Burney's final answer to her world. You wish not only that things had turned out better for her, after the fairy-tale success of Evelina, but also that she had turned out better, or at least more interesting, herself. </p> <p>The biographer, from her increasingly cool tone, clearly does not much like her subject by the end and, inevitably, some energy drains away from the narrative as a result. Still, for the recovery of a life that ought to be as well known as that of any romantic poet or later novelist, this is a great achievement. </p> <p>It is rare for a reviewer these days to complain that a biography is too short, but for once, I could have done with a couple of hundred pages more.</p>",

Many readers know her best for a single, uncharacteristic and horribly vivid description of having a cancerous breast removed without anaesthetic, a piece of icy, yet clear writing infinitely more terrifying than anything written by the entire school of gothic horror novelists. This relative obscurity would astound her contemporaries. Burney's first novel, Evelina, is a brilliant work still, a sharp, hard epistolary novel which is better than anything by Richardson and compares well with Fielding or Smollett. Her second and third, Cecilia and Camilla, are too long but still readable, while her comedies, which never found an audience at the time, are currently being rediscovered. Then, of course, there are her massive diaries and letters, an essential source for anyone interested in the turn from the eighteenth-century mind towards the age of Victoria. She was a superstar of literary London who, in her heyday, enthralled the reading public, was admired by such formidable intelligences as Johnson and Burke and whose influence on Jane Austen, Thackeray and even Dickens is indisputable. Beyond that, she lived an extraordinary life, growing up amid talented siblings (one sister was a musical child prodigy only outshone by a pint-sized Mozart and a brother sailed with Cook on his fatal voyage to Hawaii) before her literary glory, her incarceration at court, her late marriage to a refugee French soldier and her long exile in Paris, until she returned home, living until 1840, a curiosity for Sir Walter Scott to visit and Macaulay to revile. Her story is gripping but it is melancholy. The slaughter of siblings, cousins, children, friends that was the lot of so many eighteenth-century families is part of it. The Burneys had their share of family humiliations and reverses, black sheep and missed opportunities. But the core problem for a biographer is that Fanny herself went off. She almost wilfully destroyed her early promise and emerges, in old age, as a pretty unattractive character. This really, is the nub of the Burney problem and has a lot to do with her gender. Born into the coarse, robustly male world of the Enlightenment, into a family poor enough to struggle for its status, she was constantly and anxiously torn between feeding her genius and finding a place which would please her father and secure her position in 'society'. This was too early for the heroic unconventionalism of a George Eliot; Burney had no female predecessors to refer to and lived in the anxious middle ground between wealth and poverty, a place many unattached male writers could inhabit happily enough, but a much harder terrain for a single woman of modest means. Novel writing, she felt, was not quite respectable and she felt unable to turn down Queen Charlotte's offer to join the royal household at Windsor, a hideous life of exhausting routine idleness and gossip; there is a sad description of her last walk from outside life to the palace, almost unable to breathe. But after five years she did escape and before long, in one of the gayest passages in her life, unexpectedly married a penniless French \u00e9migr\u00e9 and officer, Alexandre d'Arblay, who emerges from this book as an engaging, kind, feckless man and a hilariously unbellicose soldier, like someone out of Tristram Shandy. He undoubtedly gave her her happiest years but when he died, Fanny's descent into a quavering mummifier of reputations and preserver of decency began. This tough, observant and vastly talented woman decayed into a prudish, fluffy, prolix moralist, a censorious bore, an obsessive rewriter of her family's dubious history. The hard-edged observer of eighteenth-century life becomes a nineteenth-century prig. Oh yes, and she lied. Claire Harman reviews the evidence on Burney's reshaping of the truth about her father, whose second marriage badly wounded his children and who never quite managed the literary status he craved, and incidents from her own life, including a semi-farcical near drowning (or not). Peeling back the layers of polite deceit is not easy, but has been done expertly and the result is not pretty. She was a comprehensive sanitiser, a Bowdler of her own life. This particular problem of unpeeling and exposing has been well dealt with by Harman - quite quickly, the reader trusts her fairness and judgment on genuinely tricky questions - but it leads to a second problem. Fanny was admirable in many ways, tough and brave, resourceful and hugely intelligent... but by late middle age, at least, she was not likeable, certainly not if one has had to wade through her interminable late prose. The sadness of her life, and this book, is that the young Fanny, cool and observant though she was, obsessed with her father's good opinion though she was, is nevertheless genuinely attractive in a Jane Austenish way, the miss who misses nothing, though without the greater writer's towering intelligence and merciless eye. In a sense, Jane Austen was Fanny Burney's final answer to her world. You wish not only that things had turned out better for her, after the fairy-tale success of Evelina, but also that she had turned out better, or at least more interesting, herself. The biographer, from her increasingly cool tone, clearly does not much like her subject by the end and, inevitably, some energy drains away from the narrative as a result. Still, for the recovery of a life that ought to be as well known as that of any romantic poet or later novelist, this is a great achievement. It is rare for a reviewer these days to complain that a biography is too short, but for once, I could have done with a couple of hundred pages more.",

      "body": "<p>In ascending order of cover price, as well as the subliminal aspirations of the titles, these books reflect as much about the authors as do their words within. </p> <p>Take<strong> Yakking Around the World: A Cricketer's Quest for Love and Utopia</strong> (Simon &amp; Schuster \u00a312.99, pp256), by Simon Hughes, an underpaid professional cricketer with Middlesex in the Eighties, who discusses the predicament of the jobbing sportsman stumbling through life after an extended adolescence. Whether it's bowling fast(ish) for \u00a311,000 in the dullness of the county championship, scuffling about journalism in Australia and New Zealand, or luxuriating in the mystical hardship of Udumalaipettai, beyond the Nilgiri mountains in India, Hughes is a man whose price is negotiable. </p> <p>One hopes the award-winning author had a healthy advance for this second collection of memories on the road. It is worth every penny - especially for the following observation: 'It's the Afrikaaners who should have been consigned to the gutter of life. There were dense, arrogant, hostile and often obese. Otherwise delightful.' </p> <p><strong> Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football</strong> (Bloomsbury \u00a314.99, pp246) is by David Winner, a Londoner with a slightly different perspective on the breed. 'Ever since I was a small child,' he says, 'I've had the feeling there was something special and great about the Dutch.' No glibness here, only affection and understanding of the people and their love of the game. Anyone who watched Euro 2000 will have been struck by the almost Van Goghian beauty of the massed shirts of the Dutch fans, stippled and shimmering beyond the pitch. Winner paints a suitably glowing picture to accompany that image, more ambitious than Hughes's effort, and no less impressive. </p> <p>Nick Tosches, author of<strong> Night Train: The Sonny Liston Story </strong> (Hamish Hamilton \u00a317.99, pp272) is American - and that's not meant as a criticism.Where Hughes and Winner tread self-deprecatingly about their subjects Tosches gets in the ring and slugs it out from the first bell as if he were the twin reincarnation of John L. Sullivan and Jack Dempsey. He is happy, for instance, to quote the ex-fighter Chuck Wepner: 'This guy writes like Sonny Liston hits.' </p> <p>Yet it's wholly appropriate. A brash book for a brash subject. Tosches, better known in the pages of Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone, comes to boxing on heat. He picks the dirtiest, ugliest, saddest man the fight game has thrown up in a hundred years and rides the story all the way to the grave, with some astute re-examination of boxing history. But I still prefer Hughes's observation that he'd 'been in and out of love more times than Miss Piggy'. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453354,00.html\">Buy Yakking Around the World at BOL</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502370321,00.html\">Buy Brilliant Orange at BOL</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501006267,00.html\">Buy Night Train at BOL</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "In ascending order of cover price, as well as the subliminal aspirations of the titles, these books reflect as much about the authors as do their words within. Take Yakking Around the World: A Cricketer's Quest for Love and Utopia (Simon &amp; Schuster \u00a312.99, pp256), by Simon Hughes, an underpaid professional cricketer with Middlesex in the Eighties, who discusses the predicament of the jobbing sportsman stumbling through life after an extended adolescence. Whether it's bowling fast(ish) for \u00a311,000 in the dullness of the county championship, scuffling about journalism in Australia and New Zealand, or luxuriating in the mystical hardship of Udumalaipettai, beyond the Nilgiri mountains in India, Hughes is a man whose price is negotiable. One hopes the award-winning author had a healthy advance for this second collection of memories on the road. It is worth every penny - especially for the following observation: 'It's the Afrikaaners who should have been consigned to the gutter of life. There were dense, arrogant, hostile and often obese. Otherwise delightful.' Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football (Bloomsbury \u00a314.99, pp246) is by David Winner, a Londoner with a slightly different perspective on the breed. 'Ever since I was a small child,' he says, 'I've had the feeling there was something special and great about the Dutch.' No glibness here, only affection and understanding of the people and their love of the game. Anyone who watched Euro 2000 will have been struck by the almost Van Goghian beauty of the massed shirts of the Dutch fans, stippled and shimmering beyond the pitch. Winner paints a suitably glowing picture to accompany that image, more ambitious than Hughes's effort, and no less impressive. Nick Tosches, author of Night Train: The Sonny Liston Story (Hamish Hamilton \u00a317.99, pp272) is American - and that's not meant as a criticism.Where Hughes and Winner tread self-deprecatingly about their subjects Tosches gets in the ring and slugs it out from the first bell as if he were the twin reincarnation of John L. Sullivan and Jack Dempsey. He is happy, for instance, to quote the ex-fighter Chuck Wepner: 'This guy writes like Sonny Liston hits.' Yet it's wholly appropriate. A brash book for a brash subject. Tosches, better known in the pages of Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone, comes to boxing on heat. He picks the dirtiest, ugliest, saddest man the fight game has thrown up in a hundred years and rides the story all the way to the grave, with some astute re-examination of boxing history. But I still prefer Hughes's observation that he'd 'been in and out of love more times than Miss Piggy'. Buy Yakking Around the World at BOL Buy Brilliant Orange at BOL Buy Night Train at BOL",

      "body": "<p>Anyone looking for clarification on British attitudes to the single currency should be none the wiser after the events of last week. On almost all the key issues - the Government's position on entry timing, whether it is in British industry's interest to join and, crucially, what inward investors think - the picture appears more muddled than ever. </p> <p>At the centre of the confusion are the figures produced by Invest UK, formerly the Invest in Britain Bureau, last Wednesday. These show record levels of new inward investment, creating 52,783 jobs and 757 projects and bringing \u00a347.4 billion foreign investment into the UK. </p> <p>As Eurosceptics speedily pointed out, these do not tally with statements from ministers such as Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook claiming inward investors are increasingly nervous of Britain's wait-and-see attitude to the single currency. </p> <p>Adding to the confusion were the two high-level leaks - a memo to Byers from the head of Invest UK, Andrew Fraser, and a diplomatic telegram from the UK's ambassador to Japan, Sir Stephen Gomersall, pointing out that investors might pull out of the UK if a pro-euro agenda was not pushed. </p> <p>Arch sceptics such as Lord Hanson leapt forward to claim these leaks sprang from pro-euro ministers attempting to get their spin on Invest UK figures in first. Senior government officials swiftly replied there was no evidence to back the Jeremiahs. But on Thursday Robin Cook waded in, stating that joining the euro was 'inevitable'. And on Friday European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg said in a newspaper interview that Britain was 'suffering greatly' from being outside the euro and that 'the United Kingdom satisfies all the conditions for entry, except that of the exchange rate.' </p> <p>All of which left a profound muddle for those not firmly in one camp or the other, still seeking answers to such questions as: does remaining outside the euro really concern all inward investors? </p> <p>Some of the companies mentioned in the Gomersall telegram - Nissan, Honda and bearing manufacturer NSK - are under the same exchange rate pressures as the UK manufacturers that have so publicly expressed pain in the past three years. </p> <p>Gomersall and Fraser also indicated that companies further up the 'value chain' were vulnerable, too. </p> <p>In sectors such as electronics, companies such as Matsushita, Sony and Aiwa are making investment decisions on where to make new generations of high-value products. Nurturing these companies and 'new economy' knowledge-based businesses is seen both by ministers and Invest UK officials as the future of inward investment policy. </p> <p>Invest UK states in its report that it 'has focused on attracting high quality knowledge-driven projects into the UK' and trumpets its success in attracting computer software, internet, telecoms and e-business investment to the UK. </p> <p>The Invest UK figures - which show that 48 per cent of investment comes from the US - were accompanied by a statement from Byers, who stressed once again the importance inward investors attached to the euro issue. </p> <p>The impression from all of this appears to be that although current investment levels are strong, decisions being taken now may cause downturns in future, and, like manufacturers in traditional sectors, investment by electronics and 'new economy' companies could be at risk from volatility. </p> <p>Is this the case? </p> <p>At one level manufacturers in higher technology sectors do have similar concerns to more traditional companies. </p> <p>Stephen Radley chief economist at the Engineering Employers Federation says: 'Some bigger electronics companies are looking to move production away from the UK into the euro zone or eastern Europe to avoid the currency issue.' </p> <p>EEF's Scottish head Peter Hughes says: 'IBM in Greenock is a good example. Our members are concerned that they are switching supply of components away from the UK to Eastern Europe, even India. Then they can lower costs and match them to revenues.' </p> <p>Alan Wood, chief executive of electronics manufacturer Siemens UK, with 16,000 employees, says that no major investment decisions have been reversed because of the euro, but admits that senior German figures are concerned about the UK's reluctance to join. </p> <p>The picture is more complicated than these examples suggest. Inward investment is not simply about building plants. Only 40 per cent of the total last year involved manufacturing - more went to the services, particularly the financial, sector, where there is less concern about currency swings. </p> <p>Also, much inward investment involves company takeovers, which may not add jobs, but may increase productivity. It is more difficult to assess the impact of the euro on these factors. </p> <p>So if Gomersall, Fraser and Byers are expressing concern about high-value, knowledge-based businesses, they are likely to be ones that make high value things such as electronics, mobile phones and software packages. </p> <p>Here, analysts point to three key factors in the euro argument. The first is the value of a company's products. The second is its geographical structure - are its costs and revenues in the same currency areas? And the third - how will currency swings affect productivity? </p> <p>Nick Matthews of the Warwick Manufacturing Group at Warwick University says: 'If you are exporting high volume goods and selling them on their competitive price, you are going to be affected by exchange rates. </p> <p>'Higher value products -- electronics or aerospace - are not sold simply on price. Quality and design issues make companies more resilient.' </p> <p>In 1998 Siemens closed a \u00a31.2bn chip plant in Tyneside with the loss of 1,000 jobs. There was concern that the sterling/euro exchange rate was pushing hi-tech inward investment away. </p> <p>Wood says a slump in world prices caused the closure. Although the jobs were skilled and the plant expensive (\u00a31.2bn) the product - basic Dram memory chips - is a commodity exposed to vicious demand and price cycles, rather than a high value item. </p> <p>Some companies making the products highlighted in last week's report do not see the euro as significant at all. </p> <p>Telecoms manufacturer Motorola has been in the UK for 31 years and now employs 10,000 people in six major plants. Earlier this year it took over a semiconductor plant from Hyundai in Dunfermline. </p> <p>Instead of making Dram chips, it will produce hi-tech products for mobile phones and auto electronics, which are more specialised, valuable and capable of sustaining demand than those that Siemens made. </p> <p>Motorola's Mark Durrant says: 'We take a wide variety of factors into account. But the euro is not one of them.' </p> <p>The same is true of software companies. Software industry analyst Richard Holway says that investment decisions are entirely unaffected by currency. </p> <p>This leads on to the second point - the location and structure of companies and the type of investment in the UK. As officials are keen to point out, companies pay dearly for manufacturing in the relatively high cost 'sterling zone' and selling into the lower-revenue 'euro zone'. </p> <p>Some companies avoid this trap. Holway's example is Microsoft, which has invested heavily in software development in Cambridge. </p> <p>'The software products designed here will be sold in Europe, but they will be manufactured and distributed in Microsoft plants in France, Germany and Italy, where costs and revenues can be matched.' </p> <p>This, he says, is what distinguishes UK investment from that in Ireland - where euro enthusiasts point to a burgeoning hi-tech sector, nurtured by protection from currency volatility - but where jobs tend to be 'lower value', such as call centre operatives. </p> <p>The third key factor is productivity. Car industry executives, for example, are concerned that productivity improvements of 7 per cent a year are swamped by 12 per cent currency fluctuations. But, as Radley points out, productivity improvements in newer, higher technology companies are far greater, and allow them to ride the currency swings to a greater degree. </p> <p>Official figures show that the electrical and electronics sectors saw productivity increase by 5.4 per cent in 1998 and 12.3 per cent in 1999. This compares with 0.9 per cent and 1.0 per cent for the economy as a whole, and -0.6 per cent and 3.5 per cent for manufacturing. </p> <p>'We find that the euro is less of an issue for some of these companies.

      "bodyText": "Anyone looking for clarification on British attitudes to the single currency should be none the wiser after the events of last week. On almost all the key issues - the Government's position on entry timing, whether it is in British industry's interest to join and, crucially, what inward investors think - the picture appears more muddled than ever. At the centre of the confusion are the figures produced by Invest UK, formerly the Invest in Britain Bureau, last Wednesday. These show record levels of new inward investment, creating 52,783 jobs and 757 projects and bringing \u00a347.4 billion foreign investment into the UK. As Eurosceptics speedily pointed out, these do not tally with statements from ministers such as Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook claiming inward investors are increasingly nervous of Britain's wait-and-see attitude to the single currency. Adding to the confusion were the two high-level leaks - a memo to Byers from the head of Invest UK, Andrew Fraser, and a diplomatic telegram from the UK's ambassador to Japan, Sir Stephen Gomersall, pointing out that investors might pull out of the UK if a pro-euro agenda was not pushed. Arch sceptics such as Lord Hanson leapt forward to claim these leaks sprang from pro-euro ministers attempting to get their spin on Invest UK figures in first. Senior government officials swiftly replied there was no evidence to back the Jeremiahs. But on Thursday Robin Cook waded in, stating that joining the euro was 'inevitable'. And on Friday European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg said in a newspaper interview that Britain was 'suffering greatly' from being outside the euro and that 'the United Kingdom satisfies all the conditions for entry, except that of the exchange rate.' All of which left a profound muddle for those not firmly in one camp or the other, still seeking answers to such questions as: does remaining outside the euro really concern all inward investors? Some of the companies mentioned in the Gomersall telegram - Nissan, Honda and bearing manufacturer NSK - are under the same exchange rate pressures as the UK manufacturers that have so publicly expressed pain in the past three years. Gomersall and Fraser also indicated that companies further up the 'value chain' were vulnerable, too. In sectors such as electronics, companies such as Matsushita, Sony and Aiwa are making investment decisions on where to make new generations of high-value products. Nurturing these companies and 'new economy' knowledge-based businesses is seen both by ministers and Invest UK officials as the future of inward investment policy. Invest UK states in its report that it 'has focused on attracting high quality knowledge-driven projects into the UK' and trumpets its success in attracting computer software, internet, telecoms and e-business investment to the UK. The Invest UK figures - which show that 48 per cent of investment comes from the US - were accompanied by a statement from Byers, who stressed once again the importance inward investors attached to the euro issue. The impression from all of this appears to be that although current investment levels are strong, decisions being taken now may cause downturns in future, and, like manufacturers in traditional sectors, investment by electronics and 'new economy' companies could be at risk from volatility. Is this the case? At one level manufacturers in higher technology sectors do have similar concerns to more traditional companies. Stephen Radley chief economist at the Engineering Employers Federation says: 'Some bigger electronics companies are looking to move production away from the UK into the euro zone or eastern Europe to avoid the currency issue.' EEF's Scottish head Peter Hughes says: 'IBM in Greenock is a good example. Our members are concerned that they are switching supply of components away from the UK to Eastern Europe, even India. Then they can lower costs and match them to revenues.' Alan Wood, chief executive of electronics manufacturer Siemens UK, with 16,000 employees, says that no major investment decisions have been reversed because of the euro, but admits that senior German figures are concerned about the UK's reluctance to join. The picture is more complicated than these examples suggest. Inward investment is not simply about building plants. Only 40 per cent of the total last year involved manufacturing - more went to the services, particularly the financial, sector, where there is less concern about currency swings. Also, much inward investment involves company takeovers, which may not add jobs, but may increase productivity. It is more difficult to assess the impact of the euro on these factors. So if Gomersall, Fraser and Byers are expressing concern about high-value, knowledge-based businesses, they are likely to be ones that make high value things such as electronics, mobile phones and software packages. Here, analysts point to three key factors in the euro argument. The first is the value of a company's products. The second is its geographical structure - are its costs and revenues in the same currency areas? And the third - how will currency swings affect productivity? Nick Matthews of the Warwick Manufacturing Group at Warwick University says: 'If you are exporting high volume goods and selling them on their competitive price, you are going to be affected by exchange rates. 'Higher value products -- electronics or aerospace - are not sold simply on price. Quality and design issues make companies more resilient.' In 1998 Siemens closed a \u00a31.2bn chip plant in Tyneside with the loss of 1,000 jobs. There was concern that the sterling/euro exchange rate was pushing hi-tech inward investment away. Wood says a slump in world prices caused the closure. Although the jobs were skilled and the plant expensive (\u00a31.2bn) the product - basic Dram memory chips - is a commodity exposed to vicious demand and price cycles, rather than a high value item. Some companies making the products highlighted in last week's report do not see the euro as significant at all. Telecoms manufacturer Motorola has been in the UK for 31 years and now employs 10,000 people in six major plants. Earlier this year it took over a semiconductor plant from Hyundai in Dunfermline. Instead of making Dram chips, it will produce hi-tech products for mobile phones and auto electronics, which are more specialised, valuable and capable of sustaining demand than those that Siemens made. Motorola's Mark Durrant says: 'We take a wide variety of factors into account. But the euro is not one of them.' The same is true of software companies. Software industry analyst Richard Holway says that investment decisions are entirely unaffected by currency. This leads on to the second point - the location and structure of companies and the type of investment in the UK. As officials are keen to point out, companies pay dearly for manufacturing in the relatively high cost 'sterling zone' and selling into the lower-revenue 'euro zone'. Some companies avoid this trap. Holway's example is Microsoft, which has invested heavily in software development in Cambridge. 'The software products designed here will be sold in Europe, but they will be manufactured and distributed in Microsoft plants in France, Germany and Italy, where costs and revenues can be matched.' This, he says, is what distinguishes UK investment from that in Ireland - where euro enthusiasts point to a burgeoning hi-tech sector, nurtured by protection from currency volatility - but where jobs tend to be 'lower value', such as call centre operatives. The third key factor is productivity. Car industry executives, for example, are concerned that productivity improvements of 7 per cent a year are swamped by 12 per cent currency fluctuations. But, as Radley points out, productivity improvements in newer, higher technology companies are far greater, and allow them to ride the currency swings to a greater degree. Official figures show that the electrical and electronics sectors saw productivity increase by 5.4 per cent in 1998 and 12.3 per cent in 1999. This compares with 0.9 per cent and 1.0 per cent for the economy as a whole, and -0.6 per cent and 3.5 per cent for manufacturing. 'We find that the euro is less of an issue for some of these companies. It is easier for them to make productivity gains, which help offset currency problems,' says Radley. None of these factors on its own may explain why higher technology investment has been pouring into the UK. It is clear that many manufacturers will watch the euro issue closely. But it is also likely that those 'new economy' companies lauded by ministers and Invest UK will have it at the back, not the front, of their minds. Some we won, some we lost Arrivals 1999 Component maker Toyota Gosei spends \u00a332 million on a seals plant in Rotherham, creating 400 jobs. Canadian telecoms equipment maker Nortel Networks creates 1,800 jobs, increasing capacity at sites in Paignton, Devon, and Monkstown in Northern Ireland. Grundig expands Llantrisant plant; creates 120 jobs making set-top boxes. 2000 US TV and internet shopping operator QVC doubles size of distribution centre on Merseyside, creating 1,000 jobs. US Motorola invests \u00a31.3 billion in former Hyundai semiconductor plant in Dunfermline to make mobile phone chips. Departures 1998 German electronics giant Siemens closes semiconductor plant on Tyneside with loss of 1,100 jobs. Fujitsu closes semiconductor plant in North East with loss of 500 jobs. 1999 Levi Strauss ends jeans production at Whitburn in Scotland; 700 jobs go. Goodyear closes Dunlop tyre factory in Birmingham with loss of 650 jobs. 2000 BMW announces it is to sell Rover. Sumitomo Electric Wiring Systems, a Japanese electronics company, closes factory in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear.",

If it can generate more sales through the high street, its branches will look a bit less like expensive luxuries. And how better to give staff an incentive than paying them by results? </p> <p>The scheme involves giving the local market managers control over a limited range of functions: marketing; the choice of which products to promote; human resources; and branch design.

The branch will still sell only Abbey National products, although it is possible they will be able to sell non-competing goods, such as pizzas. </p> <p>The branch design will have to comply with Abbey's chosen formats, so Ikea beech and primary colours will be out. To get those limited freedoms, the managers have to give up between \u00a38,000 and \u00a312,000 a year from their pay, which ranges between \u00a340,000 and \u00a360,000. If they meet the bank's most optimistic targets, however, they could get as much as \u00a3150,000. </p> <p>Not that they will necessarily keep all the increase themselves: how the managers incentivise their staff will be up to them. 'Our view is that rewarding people will be critical to the success of the scheme,' said Abbey spokesman Tim Harrison. </p> <p>The limited freedom makes it all the more surprising that the scheme has attracted so much interest from staff.

'They are saying they feel as if they have been underperforming in the past, and this will give them the push they need to improve,' Harrison said. </p> <p>If the trial is successful, it will be extended to the whole country. The focus on selling more may make some a little nervous. Past attempts at aggressively pushing endowment policies and personal pensions were good for financial services companies only in the short-term. They were not good for the consumer, nor for the long-term health of the industry, which is still paying for its old mistakes. </p> <p>And Barclays' lending surge in the late Eighties, which led it to large losses and slashed dividends in the Nineties, was partly caused by moves to give branch managers greater freedom to approve loans. </p> <p>That experience may explain why Abbey is keeping tight control of credit checking. </p> <p>Richard Coleman, banking analyst with ABN Amro Hoare Govett and a former Barclays employee, said: 'In a branch, the psychology is of high loyalty at branch level - it is very team-oriented - and an equal and opposite loathing of head office. Devolving decision-making can be a powerful tool.' </p> <p>Abbey is trying other ways of selling more products. It has branches in Safeway stores and is experimenting with kiosk-type outlets in busy shopping malls. It is even getting Costa Coffee into some of its branches, hoping that will encourage customers to linger long enough to buy a pension as they drop in for their weekend spending money. If that proves optimistic - and it is certainly an interesting experiment - at least the rent from the coffee shops will defray some of the costs of the branch. </p> <p>All the banks are experimenting with new formats: Bank of Scotland is in workplaces; many are in stations and airports. But these efforts still cost money, and there is no guarantee that any business they bring in is new. It may simply be transferring clients from one format to another. The same is true of the internet: all the banks are spending heavily to have online presences. </p> <p>But inertia still rules in banking. Even with gimmicks such as Lloyds TSB's proposal to add services such as shopping to its offering, they are unlikely to attract significant numbers of new customers. The costs add to, rather than than replace, those of the branch network. And, with some experts estimating that only a tiny proportion of customers would be prepared to give up their branch, the prospects for significant economies in the branch network are remote. </p> <p>This is true despite the success of Egg and other internet-only banks. Egg grew rapidly by offering unprofitable rates, attracting sophisticated savers who had the balances - and energy - to shop around. Such customers are likely to depart as soon as the next great offer, such as Halifax's IF, comes along. </p> <p>Banking can only get more uncomfortable. Over-capacity, new entrants such as Egg and Standard Life, which do not have branches to maintain, and increasing use of the internet are all intensifying the pressure. </p> <p>Last week, the banking team at Salomon Smith Barney warned of the risk of a price war in the sector. Bang on cue, HSBC announced it was slashing its mortgage rate from 7.74 per cent to 6.75 per cent, and guaranteeing to keep it within 1 per cent of the Bank of England base rate. Such gimmicks are commonly used to win new customers but HSBC is extending the deal to all its borrowers, though existing ones have to wait for it until September. </p> <p>HSBC admits this is aimed as much at keeping existing borrowers as attracting new ones. Remortgages account for about a quarter of all lending, as borrowers shop around for the latest cashback or discount. But as John Massey, head of mortgages at HSBC, acknowledges, keeping a client costs far less than winning a new one. </p> <p>This industry offers fertile ground for the doom-mongers and their predictions of Armageddon through price wars and customer-hopping. The truth is likely to be less dramatic. Margins will gradually fall; costs will inexorably rise; and profits will become harder and harder to achieve. This already afflicts much of British industry: the banks cannot expect to be left out.</p>",

All the banks are experimenting with new formats: Bank of Scotland is in workplaces; many are in stations and airports. But these efforts still cost money, and there is no guarantee that any business they bring in is new. It may simply be transferring clients from one format to another. The same is true of the internet: all the banks are spending heavily to have online presences. But inertia still rules in banking. Even with gimmicks such as Lloyds TSB's proposal to add services such as shopping to its offering, they are unlikely to attract significant numbers of new customers. The costs add to, rather than than replace, those of the branch network. And, with some experts estimating that only a tiny proportion of customers would be prepared to give up their branch, the prospects for significant economies in the branch network are remote. This is true despite the success of Egg and other internet-only banks. Egg grew rapidly by offering unprofitable rates, attracting sophisticated savers who had the balances - and energy - to shop around. Such customers are likely to depart as soon as the next great offer, such as Halifax's IF, comes along. Banking can only get more uncomfortable. Over-capacity, new entrants such as Egg and Standard Life, which do not have branches to maintain, and increasing use of the internet are all intensifying the pressure. Last week, the banking team at Salomon Smith Barney warned of the risk of a price war in the sector. Bang on cue, HSBC announced it was slashing its mortgage rate from 7.74 per cent to 6.75 per cent, and guaranteeing to keep it within 1 per cent of the Bank of England base rate. Such gimmicks are commonly used to win new customers but HSBC is extending the deal to all its borrowers, though existing ones have to wait for it until September. HSBC admits this is aimed as much at keeping existing borrowers as attracting new ones. Remortgages account for about a quarter of all lending, as borrowers shop around for the latest cashback or discount. But as John Massey, head of mortgages at HSBC, acknowledges, keeping a client costs far less than winning a new one. This industry offers fertile ground for the doom-mongers and their predictions of Armageddon through price wars and customer-hopping. The truth is likely to be less dramatic. Margins will gradually fall; costs will inexorably rise; and profits will become harder and harder to achieve. This already afflicts much of British industry: the banks cannot expect to be left out.",

Which adds piquancy to today's encounter between England and the West Indies. </p> <p>Faced with a target of 208, a paltry one given England's vibrant start to their innings, this pair overcame a dodgy start - Zimbabwe were 35 for three after 12 overs - with calm assurance. First they blunted England's pace attack, often in appalling light, before manipulating the others around the vast Oval arena. </p> <p>Throughout their 123-run partnership they paced their chase expertly, applying the accelerator just when needed. Campbell might shimmy down the wicket to pop Alan Mullally over midwicket; Flower exasperated Robert Croft with a series of surprisingly powerful reverse sweeps. And they ran impishly against an England side that lacks a real dasher anywhere in the field. </p> <p>The loss of Campbell, lbw to Croft, with 50 needed was no hindrance. Grant Flower came in, unrecognisable from the tentative Test opener, and carted the bowling with a freedom that his older brother could only admire until he fell with two runs required. So England were thrashed by five wickets and the cause was some dire batting in the second half of their innings. </p> <p>Zimbabwe's target should have been much steeper. England set off with purpose and panache after Alec Stewart had won the toss. They were 150 for two from 32 overs and 280 was on the cards, but in their last 18 overs they could muster just 57 runs in a batting display of remarkable ineptitude. Only Graeme Hick and newcomer Marcus Trescothick played with any assurance. </p> <p>Don't roll out the bunting just yet. OK, a young English batsman made his international debut and struck a crisp and confident 79, don't herald the arrival of another David Gower for a while. Trescothick played exceptionally well yesterday. He might have a fine international future ahead of him. I think he possesses that touch of class that can make the difference, but to draw too many conclusions from a rain-interrupted one-day international against a Zimbabwean attack, that resembles that of a Minor County side in terms of pace, if not guile, would be silly. </p> <p>What the left-hander did do that was most encouraging was to reproduce his excellent county form this season on the more fraught and exposed international stage. All the Trescothick hallmarks familiar to West Country folk were there. The pull shot from balls that aren't that short, the easy cover drive that goes a little squarer of the wicket than the coaching manual demands and a variety of sweeps against the spinners. </p> <p>Initially it had all looked so simple even though Stewart, in his record-breaking 126th one-day international, departed early. Trescothick and Hick added 106 in 20 overs. While the debutant was quickly at ease, Hick was commanding for an hour or so, effortlessly stroking Gary Brent for a straight six, while milking the (even) slower bowlers at will. It was odd that having reached 50 in 57 balls he should bother to try to hit Paul Strang against the spin. Trescothick soon followed, and thereafter batting against Brian Strang's little swingers and a motley array of modest spinners suddenly became a mysteriously hazardous occupation. </p> <p>Matthew Maynard was duped like a novice swinging across a dipping full-toss from Paul Strang. Andrew Flintoff soon hit a brilliant shot off Brian Strang, a skimming lofted drive rifled from the middle of his mighty bat. The only problem was that it flew straight into the hands of Brian's brother Paul at long-off. </p> <p>England were hoping that their pacemen could bail them out again. This couldn't happen twice in eight days.

Marcus Trescothick, Matthew Maynard and Robert Croft (who was in the World Cup squad but not picked) replaced Neil Fairbrother, Adam Hollioake and Angus Fraser. And they were being led by the same man, Alec Stewart.

How much longer will this go on for?</p> <p>Oh, and what of the one genuine new face? Take a bow Marcus Trescothick: your 79 was a fabulous innings under dour skies. You batted with courage and freedom and, most importantly, you did not wear the expression of a man for whom opening for England is just one big burden too many. I hope you take only the positive from today... and flippin' murder West Indies tomorrow. </p> <p><em>Matthew Hancock was editorial assistant of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2000</em></p>",

The received wisdom then was that at least the humiliation would draw the curtain on an era of underachievement. Or did it? England's clearout was not particularly wholehearted: 13 months on, seven of the defeated side lined up at The Oval today (it would have been eight had Hussain been fit). Marcus Trescothick, Matthew Maynard and Robert Croft (who was in the World Cup squad but not picked) replaced Neil Fairbrother, Adam Hollioake and Angus Fraser. And they were being led by the same man, Alec Stewart. It's too early to talk about humiliation again - let's see what happens at Lord's tomorrow - but these players blew yet another one-dayer they should have won. How much longer will this go on for? Oh, and what of the one genuine new face? Take a bow Marcus Trescothick: your 79 was a fabulous innings under dour skies. You batted with courage and freedom and, most importantly, you did not wear the expression of a man for whom opening for England is just one big burden too many. I hope you take only the positive from today... and flippin' murder West Indies tomorrow. Matthew Hancock was editorial assistant of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2000",

      "body": "<p>I never met the last Begum of Avadh, but I probably walked past her a few times on the way to the chai- wallah. According to a small news item I spotted a few years ago, the first lady of one of India's largest princely states had lived the last decade of her life in the waiting room of New Delhi railway station. Her existence, I read, had been brought to an end by a lethal dose of diamond dust and poison, self-administered. </p> <p>Death by diamond dust. There was something vaguely reminiscent of James Bond and Goldfinger about it. I had been in the waiting room at New Delhi several times and if I had failed to spot the Begum it was probably because there was a considerable population in there at the time. But the story fascinated me. I think it was the mixture of diamonds, ruined royalty and the railway. </p> <p>And then it was at the gate of the same station that I fell in with a bad crowd one night, got talking and dropped my guard. They knew me, I realised afterwards; knew that I was someone interested in diamonds, possibly someone who had been buying up stock in Surat and Bombay. We shared a packet of ginger biscuits, the type sold on every station platform in India. </p> <p>I don't remember the biscuit tasting strangely, only a point where it was soft, but by then I had swallowed and it was too late. My head fell back and hit a metal stanchion. I was found two days later, lying in a monsoon drain, my bag next to me with each of its seams neatly slit open and anything of value gone. </p> <p>Like most people, I had always thought of diamonds as an African product - one that has singularly failed to benefit the majority of Africans, but nevertheless something that came from Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola or South Africa. </p> <p>It was only when I began to trawl through the libraries that I began to notice that all the great old diamonds - the ones with wonderful romantic sagas and blood-curdling curses attached - were all connected with India. </p> <p>The single stone that stands out, is of course, the Koh-i-Noor, and one day, reading a history of its dramatic career, I started plotting its course on a map. From that rough sketch came the idea for a journey: through India on the trail of a diamond. And it was the Begum's lifeless corpse on platform 1a that gave me the means: the Indian train. Somehow diamonds and railways were the right combination. </p> <p>I started my diamond journey in Madras, a city founded by the East India Company and whose fort was the largest single building the British ever put up in the sub-continent. Far from being there only for spices, the company men were preoccupied with the diamonds that came down, illicitly, from the area known as Golconda, now Hyderabad. The stones were the perfect way for an ambitious and unscrupulous officer to line his own pocket - something that the son of a Dorset vicar, one Thomas Pitt, did with alacrity, thus founding a dynasty that would produce the two famous prime ministers. </p> <p>The ancient mines - once the only source of the world's diamonds - were located somewhere on the Krishna River between Madras and Hyderabad. A government geologist assured me that diamonds were no longer present, but his driver knew better. He took me to meet a local villager who nodded at my questions about old mines and told me that the Koh-i-Noor had been found nearby. He went into his hut and returned with a small silk purse. Telling me to hold out my hand, he shook the contents out: half-a-dozen rough uncut diamonds. </p> <p>I remember my fingers trembling. All that travelling and now I had found what I wanted: the beginning of a journey, the place where the old diamonds originated. </p> <p>From there, I headed across the Deccan to Pune and Bombay, then north up to Surat and on into Gujarat. Indian railways are not chaotic: they have preserved an old-fashioned sense of order and time-keeping that is impressive. The only problem is that they are too successful, inundated with passengers - more than 12 million a day. </p> <p>I usually preferred the second-class sleepers. In first, you get air-conditioning, which is clearly designed to create a hill station on wheels, but I prefer the heat. Also, you meet fewer people, though the seclusion can allow confidences. One night on the Bombay Express, two shady characters who claimed to be social workers gradually let their guard slip and I found we were after the same quarry: diamonds. </p> <p>The whole of the coast north of Bombay, they told me, had gone diamond mad. Every village boy dreamed of making his fortune with them. The great advantage was that literacy and paper qualifications were irrelevant; what was required was a modicum of skill at assessing stones and plenty of cunning. In the Gujarati town of Palitana, I met schoolboys whose hero was not a Bollywood star or cricketer, but their illiterate grandfather who had gone to Antwerp and become a millionaire. </p> <p>If one stone epitomises the glamour of diamonds, it is the Koh-i-Noor and my route led me to places where it had associations. Some were obvious, though no less interesting: the Taj Mahal built for Shah Jehan's wife, Mumtaz Mahal; and Agra Fort, where he was imprisoned by his own son Aurangzeb. </p> <p>Further up the Jumna River is Ram Bagh, the garden first laid out by Babur, Shah Jehan's great-great-grandfather and the founder of the Mogul empire. There, smelling of earth and water, are the ruins of Babur's summer retreat: a place of subterranean fountains and pools, all abandoned to the rats and spiders. </p> <p>It was Babur who captured a great jewel at Agra - equal in value to \"two and a half days' food for the whole world\". Quite probably this was the Koh-i-Noor, but Babur had no time for baubles. He gave it away to his son, Humayun. When the son fell ill, Babur's advisers begged him to offer the diamond as a sacrifice. But the emperor decided that the stone was not sufficient and offered his own life. According to legend, he died soon afterwards. Humayun, newly recovered, lost the empire anyway and was forced to flee westwards. </p> <p>My own route turned that way, too. I rode into Kathiawar, the broad peninsula that hangs like a jewel under the nose of land jutting out towards Pakistan. </p> <p>There are places where it seems that there is no need to keep skating across the surface of the country, a single vertical shaft sunk through the layers of accumulated history of one place will be more rewarding. Junagadh is such a spot. </p> <p>I discovered that the ruling Nawab, who had fled at Partition, had once held a dog wedding between his favourite bitch, Roshanara, and a golden retriever from Bangalore called Bobby. Eventually, by simply staying long enough, I bumped into a man whose grandfather had attended the ceremony back in the 1920s. </p> <p>\"The bride and groom wore silk gowns,\" he told me. \"They had gold chains on their paws and necklaces of jewels.\" </p> <p>Large numbers of guests attended, and dancing girls were brought from Bombay. On the wedding night, however, the Nawab became jealous and had Bobby thrown in the common kennels so Roshanara could sleep on his bed. </p> <p>My local friend took me to meet the Nawab's relatives whose reduced circumstances were starkly revealed: the rooms in their palace had been sold off one by one until it was no more than a tenement block with themselves huddled in the middle. </p> <p>Leaving Junagadh behind, the route of the Koh-i-Noor took me northwards to Gwalior, Agra and Delhi. At all times people wanted to talk. </p> <p>\"What is your family name?\" </p> <p>\"Why?\" </p> <p>\"Perhaps we are related.\" </p> <p>Snatches of crazed conversation. Notebooks and diaries full and overflowing. </p> <p>\"Sir! My lady says this is vanishing cream.\" A tube of ointment thrust into my hand. I see it is in Greek, but I can't see the woman in question. </p> <p>\"What lady?\" </p> <p>He turns, frowns and hurries away, never to be seen again by me, possibly anyone. </p> <p>In Delhi, I met with my disaster. So many fleeting relationships built up on journeys that I could no longer maintain the initial suspicion that both protects and isolates a traveller. And afterwards, my first reaction was to get on a train, to move again and hear the comforting clickety-clack of the wheels and the sudden deepening \"aaooh\" when the iron bridge starts and a vast river is far below. </p> <p>After dark, there is nothing so magical as being on a sleeper train somewhere in India. It pulls into a small station where the platform is full of people wrapped in shawls, walking up and down to keep warm or huddled around a brazier. Then the chai-wallah comes along with his mournful cry and serves cups of tea through the bars of the carriage windows. </p> <p>Sometimes the cups are sun-fired mud and, if you drink too slowly, the soft silty taste of India itself seeps into the brew. But no one really buys it for the taste: they buy it so they can smash the cup down as the train hoots and pulls away. </p> <p>Then a dozen arms reach out and the cups make a lovely pop as they hit the wooden sleepers, a noise that champagne manufacturers have been trying to emulate for years but never quite mastered - the sound of an Indian train celebrating its own departure. </p> <p><strong>How to survive Indian trains</strong></p> <p>* Buy tickets as far in advance as possible, as popular services get booked up.

      "body": "<p>The scene was familiar. A man stumbling, sweating, on a cobbled street, the midday sun screaming at his back, a noisy crowd surrounding him as he dragged a wooden cross behind him. The difference this time - 2,000 years or so later on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem - was that the man and his friends had chipped in together to hire the cross. You, too, could have your own cross to bear for \u00a315. </p> <p>It's a bit of a peculiar experience going on a weekend trip to a country 2,300 miles away. In the morning you are standing on a Tube platform in leafy Tufnell Park, north London, by mid-afternoon you are in downtown Tel Aviv. Over the next two days you cram in as much sightseeing, sunbathing, swimming and eating as you can, and you arrive back at Stansted airport feeling as if you've been away for a fortnight. The weekend break as condensed holiday. </p> <p>As a base for a mini-break, Tel Aviv, the rapidly expanding 115-year-old city on the shore of the eastern Mediterranean, is pretty much ideal. </p> <p>First impressions of cities should never count. And Tel Aviv is no different. Standing on the 15th-floor balcony of the Sheraton hotel, looking southwards along four miles of beach, you could be in Benidorm. You have the all- night bars with English and Australian waitresses, burgers and chips on the menu and European football playing on an oversized screen. Beneath lamposts and umbrellas sit the street vendors, their sunglasses, bracelets and beads laid out for sale. The place is noisy with a busy road running along the full stretch of a promenade, horns honking and car stereos playing loud. </p> <p>But then things start to get better. On one side of the busy road lies sand. A long, wide beach littered only with deckchairs and freshwater showers. Offshore, artificial islets have been created to stop the full force of the ocean from crashing in on swimmers. The rock deposits create a calm, gentle sea that is both warm and clean and populated by a surprising amount of fish. </p> <p>Inland from the beach is where the fun of Tel Aviv really starts. </p> <p>Ask Israelis to describe this city and you find yourself being addressed by two different camps. Tel Aviv or Hill of Spring was named after a biblical reference, Ezekiel 3:15. But for the Orthodox inhabitants of Israel, this is the closest the city gets to the spirit of the bible. For them Tel Aviv - only an hour's drive from Jerusalem - is the city of sin, a modern day Sodom, a city which never sleeps, merely sleeps around. It is flash, brash and unashamedly cosmopolitan. Its nightclubs open at midnight and close after dawn. Lots of lights, lots of cars. </p> <p>Worse still, it was from Tel Aviv that sprung Dana International, the transsexual Eurovision Song Contest winner whose victory brought groans of despair from Orthodox Jews and wild celebrations from its more liberal population. For many of its 700,000 inhabitants, it is the things that so enrage the conservative Israelis that provide them with the reason for living here. And for the traveller, it is those things that prove so attractive. </p> <p>The streets inland are packed with hostels, bars and restaurants. There are bazaars and markets, including Carmel Market and its array of cheap T-shirts and trainers, its spice and nut displays and its busy eateries. </p> <p>Nearby Sheinken Street is more upmarket, with designer clothes, psychedelic T-shirts and expensive shoes - beautiful clothes attracting beautiful people to a series of young, feelgood bars and restaurants. </p> <p>Indeed, food seems to be all around. From small, hole-in-the-wall felafel houses to pavement caf\u00e9s, you are hardly ever a few yards from your next lunch. For vegetarians, it is a holy grail, salads and sauces offered with mashed-up pulses, potent pastes and cold beer. A day trawling the roads and alleyways will leave you exhausted and full. </p> <p>A trip to Jerusalem changes the pace. An hour by coach from Tel Aviv, you have to be prepared to join in with the tens of thousands of other tourists. Going on a Saturday helps as the Jewish part of the city is far less crowded, but still the throng can be overwhelming, as can the amount of information to absorb. </p> <p>Jerusalem is the cultural, political and religious heart of Israel, and with that burden comes a myriad of problems for the visitor. What to see? It contains some of the most holy sites in the world for Christians, Muslims and Jews alike. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus was crucified; the Haram ash-Sharif or Temple Mount, where Mohammed is believed to have risen to Heaven; and the Western Wall - or Wailing Wall - where Jews go to pray. Add in Bethlehem, just down the road, and you are swamped. </p> <p>In a day you can only get a feel for the city. It is hot - the June sun is extreme. Refuge from the heat can be found in the cool alleyways that transport you from site to site. On either side of the cobbled streets are shops selling spices and breads, antiques and souvenirs. </p> <p>Like many cities invaded by tourists, tack is never far away; a serious exploration of history turned into a bit of a carnival. Pilgrims who want to retrace the final steps Jesus made along the Via Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrows, can do so literally. Hiring a replica cross, you travel past 14 stations from the place where Jesus was tried, past the spot where he saw his mother in the crowd, past where Simon the Cyrene helped carry the cross and on to Calvary where he was crucified. </p> <p>Jerusalem is literally a divided city with Israelis and Palestianians living in different sectors and laying claim to it as their own capital. In many ways, it reflects the problems of Israel. Scratch the surface and there are tensions. </p> <p>Occasionally, you are given a stark reminder that Israel sees itself as a nation under threat. Uniformed teenagers walk the streets in groups, semi-automatic rifles slung casually around their shoulders as if they were rucksacks. At airports and other security areas, expect to be asked whether you have talked to any local people during your visit. Police officers and guards will not mince their words. You are told quite frankly that someone may want to use you as an unwitting conduit for an explosive device. They may want to blow you up.

      "bodyText": "The scene was familiar. A man stumbling, sweating, on a cobbled street, the midday sun screaming at his back, a noisy crowd surrounding him as he dragged a wooden cross behind him. The difference this time - 2,000 years or so later on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem - was that the man and his friends had chipped in together to hire the cross. You, too, could have your own cross to bear for \u00a315. It's a bit of a peculiar experience going on a weekend trip to a country 2,300 miles away. In the morning you are standing on a Tube platform in leafy Tufnell Park, north London, by mid-afternoon you are in downtown Tel Aviv. Over the next two days you cram in as much sightseeing, sunbathing, swimming and eating as you can, and you arrive back at Stansted airport feeling as if you've been away for a fortnight. The weekend break as condensed holiday. As a base for a mini-break, Tel Aviv, the rapidly expanding 115-year-old city on the shore of the eastern Mediterranean, is pretty much ideal. First impressions of cities should never count. And Tel Aviv is no different. Standing on the 15th-floor balcony of the Sheraton hotel, looking southwards along four miles of beach, you could be in Benidorm. You have the all- night bars with English and Australian waitresses, burgers and chips on the menu and European football playing on an oversized screen. Beneath lamposts and umbrellas sit the street vendors, their sunglasses, bracelets and beads laid out for sale. The place is noisy with a busy road running along the full stretch of a promenade, horns honking and car stereos playing loud. But then things start to get better. On one side of the busy road lies sand. A long, wide beach littered only with deckchairs and freshwater showers. Offshore, artificial islets have been created to stop the full force of the ocean from crashing in on swimmers. The rock deposits create a calm, gentle sea that is both warm and clean and populated by a surprising amount of fish. Inland from the beach is where the fun of Tel Aviv really starts. Ask Israelis to describe this city and you find yourself being addressed by two different camps. Tel Aviv or Hill of Spring was named after a biblical reference, Ezekiel 3:15. But for the Orthodox inhabitants of Israel, this is the closest the city gets to the spirit of the bible. For them Tel Aviv - only an hour's drive from Jerusalem - is the city of sin, a modern day Sodom, a city which never sleeps, merely sleeps around. It is flash, brash and unashamedly cosmopolitan. Its nightclubs open at midnight and close after dawn. Lots of lights, lots of cars. Worse still, it was from Tel Aviv that sprung Dana International, the transsexual Eurovision Song Contest winner whose victory brought groans of despair from Orthodox Jews and wild celebrations from its more liberal population. For many of its 700,000 inhabitants, it is the things that so enrage the conservative Israelis that provide them with the reason for living here. And for the traveller, it is those things that prove so attractive. The streets inland are packed with hostels, bars and restaurants. There are bazaars and markets, including Carmel Market and its array of cheap T-shirts and trainers, its spice and nut displays and its busy eateries. Nearby Sheinken Street is more upmarket, with designer clothes, psychedelic T-shirts and expensive shoes - beautiful clothes attracting beautiful people to a series of young, feelgood bars and restaurants. Indeed, food seems to be all around. From small, hole-in-the-wall felafel houses to pavement caf\u00e9s, you are hardly ever a few yards from your next lunch. For vegetarians, it is a holy grail, salads and sauces offered with mashed-up pulses, potent pastes and cold beer. A day trawling the roads and alleyways will leave you exhausted and full. A trip to Jerusalem changes the pace. An hour by coach from Tel Aviv, you have to be prepared to join in with the tens of thousands of other tourists. Going on a Saturday helps as the Jewish part of the city is far less crowded, but still the throng can be overwhelming, as can the amount of information to absorb. Jerusalem is the cultural, political and religious heart of Israel, and with that burden comes a myriad of problems for the visitor. What to see? It contains some of the most holy sites in the world for Christians, Muslims and Jews alike. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus was crucified; the Haram ash-Sharif or Temple Mount, where Mohammed is believed to have risen to Heaven; and the Western Wall - or Wailing Wall - where Jews go to pray. Add in Bethlehem, just down the road, and you are swamped. In a day you can only get a feel for the city. It is hot - the June sun is extreme. Refuge from the heat can be found in the cool alleyways that transport you from site to site. On either side of the cobbled streets are shops selling spices and breads, antiques and souvenirs. Like many cities invaded by tourists, tack is never far away; a serious exploration of history turned into a bit of a carnival. Pilgrims who want to retrace the final steps Jesus made along the Via Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrows, can do so literally. Hiring a replica cross, you travel past 14 stations from the place where Jesus was tried, past the spot where he saw his mother in the crowd, past where Simon the Cyrene helped carry the cross and on to Calvary where he was crucified.

Though the pound still buys some 5% more francs than this time last summer and the French authorities insist most Brittany beaches are now clean, tour operators have been dangling discounts of up to \u00a3250 to attract customers during the school-holiday peak. </p> <p>Market research carried out for the travel industry suggests the number of package holidays to France booked through travel agents was down 19% at the end of May, compared with last year. </p> <p>Though there appears to have been a late recovery, most tour operators confirm that overall business is still down. Brittany Ferries and the Holidaybreak group -which includes camping operators Eurocamp, Keycamp and Sun Sites - have teamed up to launch a website (www. latesaverfrance.com). Earlier this week, it was listing more than 400 self-catering properties still available. Visitors to the site will find persistence pays: the biggest discounts - as much as \u00a3244 on a self-catering property in Brittany - are on the pages furthest in. </p> <p>French tourism minister Michelle Demessine has declared all Finist\u00e8re beaches oil free and says only around one in 20 of those in Morbihan and the Vend\u00e9e are still polluted. The most serious problem is an area less frequented by British tourists, around the mouth of the Loire, from La Turballe, through La Baule to the Ile de Noirmoutier. On this stretch of coast, only 30 of 72 affected beaches are likely to be clear by the start of the main holiday season. </p> <p>But Sussex-based Beck's Holidays (01273 842843), which has 50 mobile homes in resorts including <strong> St Jean de Monts </strong> in the Vend\u00e9e and <strong> Benodet </strong> in south Brittany, says the oil scare has depressed its business by 15-20%. </p> <p>\"The beaches near our camp sites are clean at the moment,\" says Jennifer Beck. \"We also operate to the Dordogne - but bookings there are not nearly as badly down.\" The company is offering \u00a350 discounts in the peak after negotiating better cross-Channel ferry deals. </p> <p>Camping operator Mark Hammerton (01892 525456) is so confident about the clean up that followed the sinking of the Erika in December that he will offer refunds if customers' holidays are marred by oil on beaches closest to his sites. </p> <p>\"I have personally inspected them - and they are all immaculate,\" he says. Among other holidays, the firm can offer 12 nights in a tent sleeping two adults and up to four children at <strong> Pleubian </strong> in Brittany for \u00a3839 or at <strong> Sarlat </strong> in the Dordogne for \u00a3905. </p> <p>But aside from oil spills, he says, France is not \"flavour of the year\". Higher cross- Channel fares, which ferry firms blame on the loss of duty-free revenue, may have been a factor. Hammerton says rates negotiated by tour operators are up by about 15%. </p> <p>French self-catering specialist Chez Nous (01484 684075) says bookings have materialised much later this year. \"We are very busy at the moment. We still have plenty of choice,\" says a spokeswoman. The company can offer proper ties in Brittany, the Dordogne and Provence among others. </p> <p>\"Although July and August are busy, there are still offers around for those people who can be flexible with dates and resorts,\" says Jonathan White, marketing manager at VFB Holidays (01242 240310, <a href=\"http://www.vfbholidays.co.uk\">www.vfbholidays.co.uk</a>). His company has knocked \u00a375 off all one-week holidays to Corsica with departures until August 20. A week's half board at the Hotel San Giovanni, near <strong> Porto Vecchio</strong>, departing on July 30, now costs \u00a3595pp based on two sharing, including flights, car hire, accommodation and insurance. </p> <p>French Life (0113 2390077) claims bookings are up on last summer. But it is offering 10% off cottage or villa holidays nonetheless. A one-week package with accommodation at the Villa Eole, near <strong> Six Fours </strong> in Provence, which sleeps up to nine, now costs \u00a32,180 between July 13 and August 23 - down \u00a3240. Crossings for an extra car and passengers cost \u00a3109-\u00a3154 return, depending on departure date. </p> <p>France is not the only country where peak-season deals can be had. Bookings to Austria are reckoned to be 14% down, perhaps because many travellers have been deterred by the success of the right-wing Freedom Party. Thomson (0870 6061470) has plenty of availability there. A week's half board in the <strong> Salzkammergut </strong> lake district, departing on June 26, costs \u00a3249. </p> <p>But unpopularity is not always a reliable indicator of late availability. The murder of two Leeds football supporters in Istanbul earlier this year is likely to have deterred tourists, and sales of packages to Turkey are lagging by 24%. This would suggest it would be worth asking your travel agent about last-minute deals - but Thomson, for one, says it has cut back capacity to Turkish resorts and has few holidays left there for the peak. </p> <p> I t has more space left in Spain's Costa Blanca and Majorca, and the Greek islands of Rhodes and Corfu. Packages still available include one week, half-board breaks at the Hotel Rio Park in <strong> Benidorm</strong>, departing on August 1, for \u00a3471; or the Hotel Metropolitan <strong> Capsis </strong> on Rhodes, departing July 31, for \u00a3605. </p> <p>Sunvil (020-8568 4499) also has Greek packages left. They include self-catering holidays in <strong> Skiathos</strong>, where two people, flying from Gatwick, could spend a fortnight for \u00a3416 each. Managing director Noel Josephides says: \"Overall, we are 5% up year on year. Cyprus is extremely full but there is some availability in Greece, provided people are flexible about when and where they go.\"</p>",

But Sussex-based Beck's Holidays (01273 842843), which has 50 mobile homes in resorts including St Jean de Monts in the Vend\u00e9e and Benodet in south Brittany, says the oil scare has depressed its business by 15-20%. \"The beaches near our camp sites are clean at the moment,\" says Jennifer Beck. \"We also operate to the Dordogne - but bookings there are not nearly as badly down.\" The company is offering \u00a350 discounts in the peak after negotiating better cross-Channel ferry deals. Camping operator Mark Hammerton (01892 525456) is so confident about the clean up that followed the sinking of the Erika in December that he will offer refunds if customers' holidays are marred by oil on beaches closest to his sites. \"I have personally inspected them - and they are all immaculate,\" he says. Among other holidays, the firm can offer 12 nights in a tent sleeping two adults and up to four children at Pleubian in Brittany for \u00a3839 or at Sarlat in the Dordogne for \u00a3905. But aside from oil spills, he says, France is not \"flavour of the year\". Higher cross- Channel fares, which ferry firms blame on the loss of duty-free revenue, may have been a factor. Hammerton says rates negotiated by tour operators are up by about 15%. French self-catering specialist Chez Nous (01484 684075) says bookings have materialised much later this year. \"We are very busy at the moment. We still have plenty of choice,\" says a spokeswoman. The company can offer proper ties in Brittany, the Dordogne and Provence among others. \"Although July and August are busy, there are still offers around for those people who can be flexible with dates and resorts,\" says Jonathan White, marketing manager at VFB Holidays (01242 240310, www.vfbholidays.co.uk). His company has knocked \u00a375 off all one-week holidays to Corsica with departures until August 20. A week's half board at the Hotel San Giovanni, near Porto Vecchio, departing on July 30, now costs \u00a3595pp based on two sharing, including flights, car hire, accommodation and insurance. French Life (0113 2390077) claims bookings are up on last summer. But it is offering 10% off cottage or villa holidays nonetheless. A one-week package with accommodation at the Villa Eole, near Six Fours in Provence, which sleeps up to nine, now costs \u00a32,180 between July 13 and August 23 - down \u00a3240. Crossings for an extra car and passengers cost \u00a3109-\u00a3154 return, depending on departure date. France is not the only country where peak-season deals can be had. Bookings to Austria are reckoned to be 14% down, perhaps because many travellers have been deterred by the success of the right-wing Freedom Party. Thomson (0870 6061470) has plenty of availability there. A week's half board in the Salzkammergut lake district, departing on June 26, costs \u00a3249. But unpopularity is not always a reliable indicator of late availability. The murder of two Leeds football supporters in Istanbul earlier this year is likely to have deterred tourists, and sales of packages to Turkey are lagging by 24%. This would suggest it would be worth asking your travel agent about last-minute deals - but Thomson, for one, says it has cut back capacity to Turkish resorts and has few holidays left there for the peak. I t has more space left in Spain's Costa Blanca and Majorca, and the Greek islands of Rhodes and Corfu. Packages still available include one week, half-board breaks at the Hotel Rio Park in Benidorm, departing on August 1, for \u00a3471; or the Hotel Metropolitan Capsis on Rhodes, departing July 31, for \u00a3605. Sunvil (020-8568 4499) also has Greek packages left. They include self-catering holidays in Skiathos, where two people, flying from Gatwick, could spend a fortnight for \u00a3416 each. Managing director Noel Josephides says: \"Overall, we are 5% up year on year. Cyprus is extremely full but there is some availability in Greece, provided people are flexible about when and where they go.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> Why:</strong> Perigian Beach in Queensland is an in-between place - five miles south of a very fashionable and expensive new resort and about five miles north of Coloundra, which is a not very pretty 1970s resort. Because it has strong rip tides and sharks, there are very few tourists. The beach itself is about 40 miles long and lined with dunes which hide the houses. It is different from anything else I've come across. I wasn't that keen on beach holidays as a kid, but going to Perigian Beach for the first time in 1990 completely transformed me. I finally understood why you might want to spend as long as you can on a beach. It looks wild but you know that within a 10-minute drive or half-an-hour walk, you can be sitting in a nice cafe drinking a coffee. It's a bit like an undeveloped version of England in the 1950s. I make sand castles with the kids, taking a big garden shovel and big buckets to build huge sand castles and then watch the tide wash them away. </p> <p><strong> What's the best thing?</strong> The scale of the beach does something to my shoulders; they seem to relax and grow wider. You can't actually see the end of the beach; it disappears into a heat haze. Then there is the simplicity of the bright blue sky, the dark blue water and the yellow strip of sand which goes on forever. </p> <p><strong> My advice:</strong> Once you have got to Queensland, you can do the rest quite cheaply. There are caravan sites where it seems families have much more fun than those staying in the posh resorts. Australians know how to enjoy themselves simply and that is often the best way to do it. </p> <p><strong> How do I get there? </strong> Austravel (0870 0550206) is offering return Qantas flights from Heathrow to Brisbane for \u00a3759pp - must be booked before August 6 for travel in September. </p> <p>\u0095 Robert Llewellyn is an actor, writer and presenter of Channel 4's Scrap Heap.

The scale of the beach does something to my shoulders; they seem to relax and grow wider. You can't actually see the end of the beach; it disappears into a heat haze. Then there is the simplicity of the bright blue sky, the dark blue water and the yellow strip of sand which goes on forever. My advice: Once you have got to Queensland, you can do the rest quite cheaply. There are caravan sites where it seems families have much more fun than those staying in the posh resorts. Australians know how to enjoy themselves simply and that is often the best way to do it. How do I get there? Austravel (0870 0550206) is offering return Qantas flights from Heathrow to Brisbane for \u00a3759pp - must be booked before August 6 for travel in September. \u0095 Robert Llewellyn is an actor, writer and presenter of Channel 4's Scrap Heap.

The exquisite countryside is regularly set alight by developers and farmers. There are times when you can't see the sky for smoke, and the destruction is awful to behold. They won't tell you about it at the tourist offices. Joan Freeman This week's question My partner, one child and I are flying to Italy next month - into Milan and out of Rome. In two weeks we plan to visit Bologna, Florence and Pisa. We are wanting to do this the cheapest way in terms of accommodation and transport (although we don't want to drive). Any tips? We don't want to come back broke. L Richardson \u0095 If you have questions or advice, please send it to: Ask a fellow traveller, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

      "body": "<p>Last November Martin Johansson was stressed out, losing sleep and fed up to the back teeth with his job in Copenhagen. It was time for a new start. </p> <p>For the previous two years, the Johanssons' one source of comfort had been their holiday home on the tiny island of M\u00f8n in south-east Denmark. Martin decided that if he could could create an enjoyable job for himself on his beloved island, he would pack in his career in shipping regardless of the financial consequences. </p> <p>Over Christmas, the Johanssons came up with a brainwave. As Martin's wife Kate is English, they would create their own purpose-built island holidays for the UK market. But how could they get started? </p> <p>Out of the blue, I received an e-mail at the production office of Channel 4's Time Team that said: \"You don't know us, but there's lots of archaeology (and plenty of other goodies) on our island. Would you like to come and road-test a holiday for us?\" And as I had a few days free from filming, and as neither my girlfriend Heli or myself had ever been to Denmark, we took up the invitation. </p> <p>After an hour's flight from London to Copenhagen, we were picked up and driven the rest of the way by the Johanssons, arriving on M\u00f8n at lunchtime. We spent the afternoon exploring. Most of Denmark is as flat as a Cambridgeshire pancake, but M\u00f8n is a beautiful island of low, rolling hills, sandy beaches and immaculate villages. Its forgotten territory, well out of the way of the great Scandinavian sea-routes, gave us a tantalising glimpse of how Denmark used to be. </p> <p>Much of the island is untouched since the bronze age, which is why the archaeology is so good. But did I really want a five-day holiday looking at ancient sites when I'd spent nearly every waking hour of the past six months doing that for a living? I'd soon have to make my mind up as, that night, we were invited to the Johanssons' home to plan our itinerary. </p> <p>But before the negotiations, the dinner; or rather the five-course banquet. Martin prepared us three kinds of marinated herring with rye bread, smoked eel with scrambled egg, gravlax, pork chateaubriand, meatballs, pickled marrow, pickled cucumber, and five different kinds of Danish cheese. I immediately fell in love with H\u00f8ng, a creamy little brie-like number which swiftly dispelled any idea that Danish blue is the only cheese this nation knows anything about. </p> <p>After a dangerously sweet-smelling liqueur, the photos and brochures were brought out, and we poured over the comparative merits of sailing, fishing, bird-watching, walking, trips off the island, bike and horse rides, and of course archaeology. </p> <p>We were told we could engage in as much or as little strenuous activity as we wanted, and, although the Johanssons were prepared to be on hand whenever we wished, if we wanted simply to potter about on our own that would be fine, too. Eventually, after much discussion, Kate drove us back to our hotel sedated by a little more of their rather good dry Riesling. </p> <p>Next morning, I had absolutely no memory of what we'd agreed to do, but whatever it was I was happy to do it. Surprise, surprise! It was archaeology. We were driven to the home of two of Martin's friends, a pair of knowledgeable amateur archaeologists, Carl and Lykke Schulz. Carl, a retired sea-captain, and Lykke, a former antique dealer, are a charming, dotty couple with very little English, but Martin translated as we wandered around their treasure trove of a home. There were antique pictures and tapestries everywhere, drawers piled high with beachcombed amber and trays covered with prehistoric hammerstones, flint blades, and beautiful 8,000-year-old M\u00f8n axes shaped like podgy CND signs. </p> <p>Halfway through the morning a bag of Danish pastries was produced. I say Danish pastries, but Kate told us the Danes deny all responsibility for these lethal calorie grenades, blaming them instead on the Austro-Hungarian empire by referring to them as Vienna bread. We chomped away using the car bonnet as a table. The cakes had bizarre names - Spandau, chocolate snail, and, my favourite, a large square of flaky pastry with a circular depression in the centre filled with bright yellow custard and crumbly nuts, graphically entitled baker's bad eye. </p> <p>Then, a real treat, a long ramble through a quiet beech forest to a deserted sandy beach, which Kate later nominated as her favourite walk. The forest floor was covered with anemones - it looked as though the entire forest had been afflicted by a bad case of floral dandruff. Martin told me in his straight-faced, Nordic way that the black adder, or snog as it's apparently known in Denmark, is common in these parts. </p> <p>Later we found ourselves at Elmelunde Church. It's an extraordinary building crowned by a series of square, white steps ascending to heaven. It looks like some thing Lutyens might have designed as a first-world-war battle memorial, but it dates back to the 11th century. Inside, the ceilings explode with the colour of primitive frescoes from the early 16th century. They were painted by a brilliant, unknown artist, the Elmelunde Master, much of whose work is thought to lie buried beneath the white plaster of neighbouring churches. Before us was a fantastic biblical world of flowers, tiny trees and dreamy-eyed people with pale triangular faces. Even when they're being tortured in the bowels of hell, his characters maintain their blithe indifference. Only the twisted bodies and bleeding wounds give testament to the deeply unpleasant time to which they're being subjected. </p> <p>But their agony didn't put us off our dinner. We were taken to an exquisitely-neat fishing village called Nyord on the north-west coast where the houses were painted in bright pastel pinks, blues and ochres. The restaurant was no more than a large family dining room full of customers. When we opened the door, all the diners stopped eating, stared at us for a few seconds, and chorused \"Good evening!\" Did we really look that English? We ate locally-caught plaice, fish soup, eel and boiled potatoes while a young child toddled from table to table being petted by everyone. </p> <p>Other highlights included a trip to M\u00f8ns Klint, an eerie whiter-than-white landscape of cliffs and bleached forest debris that resembled the White Cliffs of Dover as they would have been painted by Salvador Dali, and a stroll through the Klinteskoven, a large wooded area teetering on the edge of the chalk cliffs, which was once the home of the Klintholm gods. Even now it boasts weird shaped stones and deformed trees like something out of a Disney cartoon. </p> <p>We visited wine expert Ole Holst, another friend of the Johanssons, whose importing company, Vinhuset Doktorbakken, is based in the middle of a small forest. Between slurps, we discussed the pros and cons of the euro, German tourists and the works of Ken Loach, and ended up buying gallons more than we'd intended. </p> <p>And, of course, there was the archaeology. There are 173 passage graves, long barrows, cairns and bronze- age mounds on M\u00f8n - well worth a visit even if you aren't an archaeology freak. </p> <p>The joy of the Johanssons' holiday plan is its flexibility. You can decide what you want to do before you go, once you are there, or during your holiday. You can stay in a hotel, self-cater, or inflict yourselves on the Johanssons or their friends. And because travel is so easy, our five-day holiday seemed like a genuine five days, not a snatched weekend. As for the weather, my preconceptions proved to be wide of the mark: we were there over the Easter weekend and, while England was in the grip of rain and icy winds, we spent five days basking in the spring sun. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Go (<a href=\"http://www.go-fly.co.uk\">www.go-fly.co.uk</a>) flies from Stansted to Copenhagen from \u00a350 return.

The site then suggests various deals that might suit them. Perhaps some culture in Italy? No, you can't have that. It generated a Javascript error. Entertainment in Germany? That's no good either. I suggest you compromise and avoid the dodgy pull-down menus altogether. Go to Entertainment, then choose Germany, and a three-night trip to the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim for around \u00a3400 could be yours. Unfortunately, it's not possible to search by date. Are the last-minute offers cheap? Not necessarily. Most weekends are at least \u00a3400, although a day trip to northern France with a round of golf and Channel crossing thrown in is \u00a342. One-night spa breaks are also relatively inexpensive. I still can't decide. What's the verdict? A good idea but rather poorly executed. Web Weekends needs more work - including working pop-up photos, greater detail and better navigation - if it is going to survive at all.",

      "body": "<p>Dreaming about your big trip is exciting, but trying to organise it can be daunting, especially if it's your first time. There's so much to plan, so many decisions to make and so much to think about. From planning your route to packing your bag, here are the first steps to take. </p> <p><strong> Where should I go?</strong><br> </p> <p> There's a classic RTW (round-the-world) route of South-East Asia, followed by Australia, New Zealand and home via the US. For first-timers, it can be comforting to follow such a well-trodden path, where getting around and finding places to stay is extremely easy, and you'll meet lots of fellow backpackers. If you're feeling more adventurous, the options are endless. A trip round South America, followed by some island-hopping across the Pacific. Head for Moscow, take the Trans-Siberian to Beijing then travel round China. And what about India? The Middle East? Africa? </p> <p>If you're on a tight budget, remember that it's cheaper to travel in India or South-East Asia than it is in, say, the US or Australia, and save very expensive countries, such as Japan or Argentina, for when you're better off. </p> <p>If it's your first trip, you might prefer not to make a \"difficult\" country your first stop. India, for example, can be a huge shock if you go straight from the UK. And although most RTW travellers tend to go round the globe in an easterly direction, there's nothing to stop you flying the other way round, so you'd start off in the US, where the language, customs and culture are familiar, then work your way up to more exotic destinations. And, of course, you don't literally have to go round the world - you might want to spend time exploring a particular area, Asia or Africa, say, in depth. </p> <p>Once you've decided on a rough itinerary, visit two or three specialist travel agents (see contacts box) for advice and travel costs. Most have staff who are widely travelled themselves and may come up with routes or ideas you hadn't thought of. Take time to consider all your options and compare prices before making a booking. </p> <p>Wherever you decide to go, get up-to-date advice from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Travel Advice Unit (020-7238 4503/4; <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/\">www.fco.gov.uk/</a>). This provides the latest information on the political and safety situation in most foreign countries. </p> <p><strong> How much will it cost?</strong><br> </p> <p> How long is a piece of string? To start with your ticket, the price will depend on your route, how many stopovers you make and the time of year. For flights within the northern hemisphere, low season is November to March, high season is July and August and mid-season is any other time. If you're travelling to the southern hemisphere, however, the seasons are different. So, for destinations such as South Africa, Australia or New Zealand, December is high season - which means full flights and the highest fares. </p> <p>Basic RTW fares start from around \u00a3700, but the more stopovers you have, the more expensive your ticket will be. Local events affect fares, too. For example, if you want to go to Hong Kong around the time of Chinese New Year (usually in February), you'll find fares will be expensive, and so will fares to neighbouring countries such as China and Vietnam. </p> <p><strong> How much spending money should you take? </strong><br> </p> <p> It depends on your route, how you're planning to travel, what kind of accommodation you stay in and so on. Obviously, a week spent lazing on a beach in Thailand will cost next to nothing, while a week doing the sights of a city or lots of travelling will be more expensive. As a general guide, you should probably allow around \u00a310 a day, but \u00a315 a day will make for a more comfortable trip. We usually budget for \u00a320 a day, so we can splash out on the odd G&amp;T instead of beer, travel in air-con instead of third class on hot, humid days, or move up a hotel notch if the cheapest room is a real dump. And we always have our credit cards in case of emergencies or special occasions, or when we don't want to miss out on something like a day's whitewater rafting or scuba diving. </p> <p>That said, we've met plenty of travellers on much smaller budgets - but we reckon it's better to spend longer at home saving up then have a good time while you're away, than to find yourself adding up your small change on a Saturday night to see if you can afford a weekly beer between two. </p> <p>Remember, too, that you'll need to allow for insurance (look out for special basic backpacker policies, which can bring the cost of a year's cover down to around \u00a3200-\u00a3250) and for pre-trip vaccinations (your GP is your cheapest source, so start there before going to a travel clinic). </p> <p><strong> What should I take with me?</strong><br> </p> <p> As little as possible - remember, you're going to have to carry it everywhere. Take clothes that are quick and easy to wash and dry. Loose-fitting clothes are more comfortable in hot climates and can be layered if it gets cooler. T-shirts and baseball caps with English slogans are popular for swapping and bartering with. Sarongs are versatile (they can be used as a towel, a beach mat, a skirt, a sheet, a scarf...). But don't pack too many clothes - you won't need an extensive wardrobe and you can easily (and cheaply) buy things en route. </p> <p>Don't load yourself down with toiletries either - they're heavy. They're also usually cheap and easily found everywhere. Items like contact-lens solutions and tampons may be harder to find, but stock up in major cities as you go and there shouldn't be a problem. </p> <p>There are a few items we never leave home without: books (but not too many; you can swap with other travellers); Walkman and tapes (sanity-savers on long journeys); a medical kit; money belt; travel alarm clock (long-distance buses always seem to leave at unearthly hours of the morning); Swiss Army knife (with corkscrew); and torch (not everywhere has 24-hour electricity). And don't forget to pack photocopies of essential documents, like passport and visas (just in case you lose them). </p> <p><strong> Staying healthy </strong><br> </p> <p> A couple of months before you go, visit your doctor or a travel clinic to find out what vaccinations you need. Don't leave it until the last minute - some vaccinations take time to become effective or need to be administered in stages. For up-to-date health information on your destination countries, contact MASTA (Medical Advisory Services for Travellers Abroad) on 0906 822 4100 (60p/min) or at <a href=\"http://www.masta.org.\">www.masta.org.</a> </p> <p>Have a dental check-up before you go, too. </p> <p>The illnesses you're most likely to come into contact with are those spread via contaminated food and water, so following a few simple rules will help keep you safe. Drink only bottled water (and use it to brush your teeth); avoid ice in your drinks; be wary of salads (they may have been washed in tap water); only eat fruit you can peel yourself; and steer clear of food that has been reheated or kept warm. </p> <p>If you get diarrhoea (and most people do at some stage), drink lots of bottled water, eat only plain foods, stay out of the sun and avoid alcohol and milk. It usually clears up on its own after a few days. </p> <p>Go easy on the sun - if you're not used to hot climates, it's easy to misjudge how fierce it is. Follow the Aussie slogan of \"Slip, slop, slap\": slip on a T-shirt, slop on the sun lotion and slap on a hat. Remember that you can still burn underwater and in cloudy weather. And no matter how tempted you may be, stay out of the sun between 11am and 3pm, when it's at its fiercest. </p> <p><strong> Keeping in touch with home</strong><br> </p> <p> Don't forget that while you're having the time of your life, your family and friends will be missing you and looking forward to hearing about your adventures. Luckily, the e-mail boom has made it easier than ever to keep in touch: all around the world you'll find cybercaf\u00e9s and hostels offering Internet access. Just set yourself up with an e-mail address before you leave home: two of the most popular services (both free) are Hotmail (<a href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">www.hotmail.com</a>) and Yahoo! Mail (<a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">www.yahoo.com</a>), then wherever you are you can send and collect messages. Some cybercaf\u00e9s will even scan in photos so you can send your holiday pics home. </p> <p>Of course, not everyone at home has Internet access, so don't forget to keep in touch the traditional way, too. Writing is simple and cheap, but don't feel you have to send a 10-page letter every week or it will start to seem like a chore. Quick postcards are just as good. </p> <p>Phoning home is a real treat, but can be expensive, so save it for special occasions - and never promise to call at regular times. If you promise your mum you'll always call on the last Friday of the month, chances are that that day will find you sailing down the Yangtze or halfway up a mountain and nowhere near a phone, which will worry the person waiting for your call. </p> <p><strong> Further information</strong><br> </p> <p> The Internet is an excellent source of information and advice for travellers.

      "body": "<b>Dear Mr Shamdasani,</b> <br> In his books on the Emperor Claudius, Robert Graves tells how the imperial physician, Xenophon, advised his patient to break wind whenever he felt so moved. \"Better to cause your friends a moment's inconvenience than yourself a lifelong injury,\" declared the good doctor. No dry-as-dust history book or earnest university thesis would furnish the reader with such a detail; indeed, levity of this kind would be frowned upon in a serious work for lowering the tone. But this little vignette brings home the Emperor's humanity as vividly as the ripest of ox-tongue fuelled explosions, and would therefore have been prized as a perfect piece of gossip - the sort of thing the gossip festival being held this week in Waterford, Ireland might relish. Gossip, which we all enjoy whether we admit it or not, allows us to picture people as they are rather than how they would like to be seen. The whisper may be of the government minister who keeps a mistress in Croydon (no class, this New Labour lot), or of the celebrated artist who imbibed too deeply of the liquid muse at a cocktail party and created a contemporary work all over his hostess's shoe * such stories provide a glimpse into the increasingly image-controlled lives of our rulers and our icons. Gossip is a way of calling public figures to account and of reminding them that they are as fallible as the rest of us. It*s also a lot of fun. Best regards, <br> Sholto Byrnes, <br> Deputy editor of Londoner's Diary, Evening Standard. <br> <br> <b>Dear Mr Byrnes,</b> <br> <br> The anecdote you cite is a prime example of what I call \"History Lite\", or evidence free history. The case against gossip may be posed by considering one of the prime examples of \"History Lite\" - psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis was founded in and through gossip. In Freud's case, histories are compendiums of Viennese gossip from the turn of the century. However, historians such as Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, Henri Ellenberger, Han Israels, Anthony Stadlen, Frank Sulloway and Peter Swales have shown that many of these case histories are themselves species of gossip, compounded of fables, theoretical fictions and fabrications. Furthermore, they have shown that psychoanalysis owes its ascendance in no small measure to the concoction of myths. <br> <br> The rise of psychoanalysis is an example of how lies, vilification and vituperation against opponents became consolidated into legends, which came to be believed in by large sectors of the public. Through this, history became fictionalised. Ironically, what set out to surpass all other forms of understanding is in the process of dissolving into a series of metaphors, remnants of which surface in daily gossip. <br> <br> Sonu Shamdasani <br> Research fellow <br> Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, London and participant in the Waterford Myth and Theatre festival, whose theme this year is gossip. <br> <br> <b>Dear Mr Shamdasani,</b> <br> <br> I am indebted to you for reminding me of the work of Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, Henri Ellenberger et al. However, blaming the rise of psychoanalysis, which I timidly suggest has been of use to some people, on gossip does seem to be stretching the connection a little far. I wonder who told you that psychoanalysis and gossip were related. Was it a hushed aside at a book launch, or did a mischievous soul hint at some inappropriate, below-stairs coupling between the two? <br> <br> In fact, the relationship is the other way round. The more people gossip, the less they need to spend their afternoons on an analyst's couch. I am, of course, referring to a really good gossip - a fully-blown, let it all hang out, I-shouldn't-say-this-but-I-will kind of gossip. <br> <br>Surely you recognise the catharsis in getting out into the open all that you think about friends but would never say to their faces? Or gleefully repeating all the secrets you have solemnly promised to take to the grave? Far better to drain the boil of resentment by having a gossip about the object of ire, than self-righteously simmer and nurse a grudge which grows all the uglier through never seeing the light of day. <br> <br> Regards, <br> Sholto Byrnes <br> <br> <b>Dear Mr Byrnes, </b> <br> <br> You are quite right, I was stretching it a bit. My point is, what are the consequences when what starts out as gossip, rumour and innuendo becomes elaborated into legends and passed off as history? You pose the question, is gossip the free cathartic cure? But isn't this cathartic theory of gossip as therapy itself influenced by psychoanalysis? It is not insignificant that Freud launched psychoanalysis on the back of Breuer's \"cathartic cure\" of Anna O, which, as Ellenberger showed, was neither a catharsis nor a cure. In fact, the treatment ended with her being checked into a psychiatric hospital with worse symptoms than before. <br> <br> I would maintain that with psychoanalysis, what was previously consigned to gossip became seen as the key to an individual's life and work. The \"ad hominem\" became a teachable method. Furthermore, the need for evidence was replaced by the certitudes of interpretation. I wouldn't contest that many people have found psychoanalysis of use - the same goes for numerous other psychotherapies and treatments from past-life regression therapy to Prozac. However, psychoanalysis has spectacularly failed to provide evidence of its supposed superiority to other methods - including your therapy by gossip. <br> <br> Yours sincerely, <br> Sonu Shamdasani <br> <br> <b>Dear Mr Shamdasani,</b> <br> <br> The idea that gossip and the associated benefits have anything to do with psychoanalysis is not one to which I lend much credence. If prostitution is the oldest profession, then gossip is almost certainly the second oldest form of conversation.

      "bodyText": "Dear Mr Shamdasani, In his books on the Emperor Claudius, Robert Graves tells how the imperial physician, Xenophon, advised his patient to break wind whenever he felt so moved. \"Better to cause your friends a moment's inconvenience than yourself a lifelong injury,\" declared the good doctor. No dry-as-dust history book or earnest university thesis would furnish the reader with such a detail; indeed, levity of this kind would be frowned upon in a serious work for lowering the tone. But this little vignette brings home the Emperor's humanity as vividly as the ripest of ox-tongue fuelled explosions, and would therefore have been prized as a perfect piece of gossip - the sort of thing the gossip festival being held this week in Waterford, Ireland might relish. Gossip, which we all enjoy whether we admit it or not, allows us to picture people as they are rather than how they would like to be seen. The whisper may be of the government minister who keeps a mistress in Croydon (no class, this New Labour lot), or of the celebrated artist who imbibed too deeply of the liquid muse at a cocktail party and created a contemporary work all over his hostess's shoe * such stories provide a glimpse into the increasingly image-controlled lives of our rulers and our icons. Gossip is a way of calling public figures to account and of reminding them that they are as fallible as the rest of us. It*s also a lot of fun. Best regards, Sholto Byrnes, Deputy editor of Londoner's Diary, Evening Standard. Dear Mr Byrnes, The anecdote you cite is a prime example of what I call \"History Lite\", or evidence free history. The case against gossip may be posed by considering one of the prime examples of \"History Lite\" - psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis was founded in and through gossip. In Freud's case, histories are compendiums of Viennese gossip from the turn of the century. However, historians such as Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, Henri Ellenberger, Han Israels, Anthony Stadlen, Frank Sulloway and Peter Swales have shown that many of these case histories are themselves species of gossip, compounded of fables, theoretical fictions and fabrications. Furthermore, they have shown that psychoanalysis owes its ascendance in no small measure to the concoction of myths. The rise of psychoanalysis is an example of how lies, vilification and vituperation against opponents became consolidated into legends, which came to be believed in by large sectors of the public. Through this, history became fictionalised. Ironically, what set out to surpass all other forms of understanding is in the process of dissolving into a series of metaphors, remnants of which surface in daily gossip. Sonu Shamdasani Research fellow Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, London and participant in the Waterford Myth and Theatre festival, whose theme this year is gossip. Dear Mr Shamdasani, I am indebted to you for reminding me of the work of Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, Henri Ellenberger et al. However, blaming the rise of psychoanalysis, which I timidly suggest has been of use to some people, on gossip does seem to be stretching the connection a little far. I wonder who told you that psychoanalysis and gossip were related. Was it a hushed aside at a book launch, or did a mischievous soul hint at some inappropriate, below-stairs coupling between the two? In fact, the relationship is the other way round. The more people gossip, the less they need to spend their afternoons on an analyst's couch. I am, of course, referring to a really good gossip - a fully-blown, let it all hang out, I-shouldn't-say-this-but-I-will kind of gossip. Surely you recognise the catharsis in getting out into the open all that you think about friends but would never say to their faces? Or gleefully repeating all the secrets you have solemnly promised to take to the grave? Far better to drain the boil of resentment by having a gossip about the object of ire, than self-righteously simmer and nurse a grudge which grows all the uglier through never seeing the light of day. Regards, Sholto Byrnes Dear Mr Byrnes, You are quite right, I was stretching it a bit. My point is, what are the consequences when what starts out as gossip, rumour and innuendo becomes elaborated into legends and passed off as history? You pose the question, is gossip the free cathartic cure? But isn't this cathartic theory of gossip as therapy itself influenced by psychoanalysis? It is not insignificant that Freud launched psychoanalysis on the back of Breuer's \"cathartic cure\" of Anna O, which, as Ellenberger showed, was neither a catharsis nor a cure. In fact, the treatment ended with her being checked into a psychiatric hospital with worse symptoms than before. I would maintain that with psychoanalysis, what was previously consigned to gossip became seen as the key to an individual's life and work. The \"ad hominem\" became a teachable method. Furthermore, the need for evidence was replaced by the certitudes of interpretation. I wouldn't contest that many people have found psychoanalysis of use - the same goes for numerous other psychotherapies and treatments from past-life regression therapy to Prozac. However, psychoanalysis has spectacularly failed to provide evidence of its supposed superiority to other methods - including your therapy by gossip. Yours sincerely, Sonu Shamdasani Dear Mr Shamdasani, The idea that gossip and the associated benefits have anything to do with psychoanalysis is not one to which I lend much credence. If prostitution is the oldest profession, then gossip is almost certainly the second oldest form of conversation. When archaeologists came across hieroglyphics for which no Rosetta stone could provide the key, it was obvious what was going on - the ancients were having a good chinwag and didn't want everyone to clock what was being communicated. Gossip was around long before Freud was even a twinkle in his father's eye. Sure, gossip is viewed as being slightly louche, but we don't all want to be saints. Gossip is a form of mischief - which in turn is a key constituent of a well-developed sense of humour - and it seems to me that a sense of humour is an essential tool for coping with the slings and arrows of adversity in life. The alternative is either inhabiting some pessimistic universe in which every piece of bad news is greeted with grim satisfaction, or becoming a holier-than-thou ascetic. A final, more serious point: those who are comfortable with who they are and have come to terms with their own failings have nothing to fear from gossip. Only hypocrites or the terminally insecure cannot deal with a little gentle ribbing. Regards, Sholto Dear Mr Byrnes, I wonder who is overstretching gossip now? From being the only revealer of the truth of history, gossip became a cathartic cure and is now revealed before us as a universal panacea to the human condition and the key to the good life. Truly a protean beast, this gossip! Though I find your cosmology mystifying (either pessimism/ asceticism or gossip), I think your less than funny conclusion gives the game away.

      "body": "<p>Back at the hotel, there are more interviews. The Police Federation speech has led the One O\u00d5Clock News, and run big in the London Evening Standard. But there is trouble brewing. Straight away, the political editor of the Scottish Sun wants a line on the Mike Tyson row that has exploded into a constitutional battle between the Scottish Parliament, which wants to ban the convicted rapist from boxing in Scotland, and Jack Straw, who won\u00d5t exclude Tyson from the United Kingdom. The Tyson story is in danger of wiping out Hague\u00d5s visit to Scotland as a news item. There is a brief discussion about what line to take. There is no line, and Hague refuses to comment. Within a few minutes, the Scottish Sun man closes his notebook. Later, Amanda Platell explains the decision: if they comment on Tyson, they\u00d5ll just become part of the Tyson story. As it turns out, the Tyson row does kill media interest in Hague\u00d5s visit \u00d1 even the Scottish broadsheets relegate the story to page nine; the Scottish Sun carries nothing.</p> <p>Soon, we are back on the road again, to the Eastwood constituency dinner for Spanish melon, roast sirloin of beef and a rousing campaign speech by William for the 225 \u00a325-a-head members and guests at the concrete 60s Normandy Hotel, in the suburbs of Glasgow. It\u00d5s another stage for Hague, glad-handing, greeting, frozen smiles and pictures with a whole queue of Tory council candidates. Later, after his speech, as part of some other ritual, he will walk around alone and introduce himself to each table of seated diners. The road to Downing Street, it seems, is paved with social excruciation.</p> <p>Hague is an accomplished public speaker. His delivery is good, the comic timing spot on, and the cadences of rhetoric just right. He is a master of the big set-piece conference platform speech; his hands wave, he declaims, he cajoles. Tonight is a walk-over. Like all good after-dinner speakers, he starts off warming up the audience with a few jokes from old newspaper headlines \u00d1 \"Home Secretary to act on Porn Video\" \u00d1 and then hits with his big theme: Tony Blair is a fraud and the fortunes of the Tory Party can be revived.</p> <p>He is scathing: \"I know our chief opponent very well, because I have to ask him those questions every Wednesday afternoon. </p> <p>I have to get into the way he thinks, think the way he thinks, and how he will answer those questions. I know that he does not believe in anything at all. At the last election, that gave him an advantage; at the next election, it gives us an advantage.\"</p> <p>It was my first Conservative dinner, and it was a shock. The Party is old; most of the dinner guests were in their 70s. It was hard to believe that this Britain \u00d1 bouffant hair-dos, portly, uniformed chauffeurs, crinoline ball-gowns and floral prints \u00d1 still existed; Planet Tory. It was like stepping back into the 50s. One thing was sure, these people would not be knocking door to door at election time. At one table at the back was a small clique of young men from Glasgow University\u00d5s Conservative Society. They are strangely awkward, arrogant, odd-looking, dressed in clothes borrowed from their grandparents; young Williams revisited 20 years later.</p> <p>Hague is not a fretter. He sleeps soundly. He is genuinely confident and relentlessly optimistic about both the Tories\u00d5 and his own prospects. He runs the Tory party like a company. Meetings are short, brisk and decisive. He does not like endless argument, and when he reaches a position, he sticks with it. \"I like to hear the argument and then decide \u00d1 just sleep on it and know. It\u00d5s the same asking questions of the Prime Minister. Sometimes you can sit for hours thinking about the issues you could ask him about and working it all out \u00d1 the moves on the chessboard, as it were. But, actually, usually when I\u00d5ve really pinned him to the wall, it\u00d5s when I\u00d5ve woken up that morning and thought of something \u00d1 that is going to be the thing I nail him on today.\"</p> <p>In the morning, he does more radio and then drives to the outskirts of Edinburgh for a press conference on today\u00d5s theme: keeping the pound. It\u00d5s been raining, the hotel is cold, miserable. It\u00d5s a poor turnout from the press: Tyson 1, Hague 0. Clustered in a corner are another batch of the men who characteristically make up the political class of Britain. They stand around and smile, but their eyes are full of hunger for the glitter of attention as they watch the Leader being interviewed, again and again, by the few reporters who do turn up. The dominant emotion is not awe but envy. Among them stands Malcolm Rifkind, shorn of his former grandeur of power. He reminds me for all the world of my old Edinburgh dentist. It\u00d5s hard to believe he was once the British Foreign Secretary, and these the remnants of a political party that once ruled Britain.</p> <p>Hague is at home in this world, as much a creature of the Conservative Party as he is his father\u00d5s son. He inherited his politics from his father, Nigel, an instinctive Yorkshire Tory who ran a small soft-drinks company, Charles Hague &amp; Sons, manufacturing lemonade. Ironically, Hague is the first Tory leader ever to have gone to a state school. He was educated at Wath-on-Dearne Comprehensive in Rotherham, Yorkshire, whose social mix included the sons of miners and steelworkers, after rejecting a scholarship to a state boarding school, Ripon Grammar, 30 miles from home. Hague got four As at A-Level and went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in, predictably, Politics, Philosophy and Economics, as well as being president of the Oxford Union. He has a further diploma from the prestigious INSEAD French institute.</p> <p> For five years, Hague was a management consultant with McKinsey, but that was just his day job. According to his CV, even as he worked at McKinsey, he was already political adviser to Geoffrey Howe and Leon Brittan in the Thatcher Government. His line about his life outside politics sounds just like that, a line. \"I have seen life from many different angles. I have not had a privileged upbringing. </p> <p>I learned more delivering beer round the working men club\u00d5s in Rotherham when I was a teenager than I learned at Oxford.\"</p> <p>Bill Clinton, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair also spent their entire lives training for political office, but Hague\u00d5s resum\u008e is narrower: he started out as a political altar boy and he has single-mindedly devoted his entire life to the Conservative party from the age of 15. His family nickname was \"Tory boy\", and he was chairman of the Rother Valley Young Conservatives at the grand old age of 16. His infamous speech was delivered to the 1977 Blackpool Tory conference two years before Thatcher entered Downing Street.</p> <p>In many ways, Hague has been giving the same speech ever since. \"As a 16-year-old, I represent what may well seem to be the last generation for the Conservative Party. That lack of support stems largely from the fact that the party is seen, rightly or wrongly, as standing for the maintenance of the existing political and economic order. The young people who voted so overwhelmingly against our party last time are people who believe in change \u00d1 not change for change\u00d5s sake, but because they are dissatisfied with the existing state of affairs in Great Britain.They want a society where effort and initiative are rewarded instead of being stamped on \u00d1 most of all they want to be free from the government, the government that they think should get out of their lives . . . if we rise to the challenge and if we determine to roll back the frontier for the state, we will not only capture the imagination of younger people, we will save free enterprise and Great Britain and create a capital-owning, home-owning democracy.\" </p> <p>Part of his strength, and his weakness, is this monumental belief in the Conservative cause. His fundamental political position is simple: the Tories should be in power always. From time to time, most of us wonder what it would be like to be a politician, but few of us, I think, could bear the price, the mind-numbing repetition of policy and belief, the wasted hours in wasted argument in dead committee rooms, the incremental advantage of this alliance instead of that alliance, the hanging around in the company of the warped, the fanatic, the politically ambitious. It requires extraordinary self-discipline and a sectarian passion for self-promotion. There is no doubt that Hague qualifies on both counts. \"It helps if you enjoy being the centre of attention, being at the centre of events, and you don\u00d5t mind everything being public in your life. I have always enjoyed that, or not minded it. It helps if you enjoy giving speeches, and setting out positions. There is an element of being an actor in there, without being completely taken over by being an actor. I think there is a bit of all that in me.\"</p> <p>William Hague, I am pretty sure, was never much of an ordinary human being. His unadulterated devotion to his political cause raises uncomfortable questions about his very suitability for the office to which he aspires. Is there a real William Hague underneath the latest policy positions? Is there a warm human being behind the grin of the accomplished debater?</p> <p>His passion for politics seems to leave space for little else. He has the air of a man not overly concerned with money or luxurious living. His clothes look inexpensive, even if they\u00d5re not. His London base is a flat in Dolphin Square and he has another flat in a stately home in his Yorkshire constituency. </p> <p>In a belated bid to humanise his trainspotter image, Hague has taken up judo, revealed his passion for cross-country skiing and, most famously, got married to Ffion Jenkins, in December 1997. For years he has been dogged by rumours in the Westminster village that he is gay (despite the fact that he had a girlfriend when, in 1987, he first set his sights on the Richmond constituency, some 70 miles north of his home town) \u00d1 rumours that he has denied on the record. But, with a beautiful wife by his side, he is now, in the textbook Tory leader script, a happily married, firmly-founded, individual. \"I do not intend to lose. But when you have the home, family, wife, interests that I have, there is no need to fear losing,\" he says.</p> <p> But, despite the image make-over, Hague remains an enigma. Ffion\u00d5s presence, 300 public engagements later, has not softened his monastic, geeky image. Close observers say their relationship is joshy, schoolboy/ schoolgirl flirtatious, but their marriage remains a rigidly private matter, as closed off as the inner recesses of Hague\u00d5s own self. In this respect, the contrast with the Ford Galaxy-driving First Family Blair, and the patter of Leo\u00d5s little feet, could not be more pointed.</p> <p>We move on to the local Currie High School. Aides, camera crews, Hague, other politicians, teachers \u00d1 a party of around 20 \u00d1 squeezing our way into a couple of classrooms in search of the elusive photo opportunity. The kids seem more frightened than curious, worried that the wrong remark might spell trouble. We end up downstairs in the library for a question-and-answer session with the sixth form.</p> <p>The kids are 16 to 18 and show a healthy disrespect for the politician in front of them. Hague launches straight into a sectarian defence of the Conservative position. It\u00d5s just another hustings. The kids\u00d5 questions are predictable: crime, asylum, the battle over the repeal of Section 28, the clause that supposedly bans local authorities from promoting homosexuality in schools.</p> <p>In Scotland, Labour\u00d5s plans to repeal the clause have proved to be a political disaster. The actual meaning of the Section 28 clause has long ceased to have any direct relevance to the storm of accusation and counter-accusation unleashed by the privately-funded \"referendum\" and Scottish Cardinal Thomas Winning\u00d5s denunciation of \"perverts\". The Scottish Tory Party is strongly opposed to the clause\u00d5s repeal, despite well-founded media whispers that a number of prominent Scots Tories are themselves closet gays. Hague\u00d5s answer is another little masterpiece, coating a reactionary stance in an outer layer of seeming tolerance. \"I am not saying that everyone should live in a particular way. </p> <p>I think we should be tolerant of people having different sexual orientations. We have got past all the attitudes that everyone has to live in a particular way. But that does not mean taxpayers\u00d5 money should be used to promote a particular lifestyle. That is a separate issue. In our party, you will find people of a different sexual orientation who will agree about Section 28. The great majority of the public also agree about Section 28. Politicians have to respect issues like that.\"</p> <p>But, for all the clever sophistry of his answer, Hague\u00d5s mini-hustings at Currie High School revealed not the depth but the limitations of his repertoire. He repeated a few jokes and the kids laughed, once or twice, but there was not any sense of connection. William did not enthuse, he did not inspire, he does not even pretend to give the standard political argument about politics, democracy and why, in an era of democratic apathy, the kids should bother voting for anyone. It was a telling moment. It is an argument that Hague is constitutionally incapable of enunciating; the blood in his veins runs so Tory blue that he would rather the sixth-formers of Currie High School stayed at home on polling day than vote Labour. To the private consternation of some of his staff, Hague does not even recognise his omission. The instincts of the Conservative battling debater can take you only so far. You also have to have the \"vision thing\".</p> <p>We head off towards a Keep the Pound Rally in Princes Street gardens, and serious opposition. The rally has attracted about 200 people, including a large contingent of Socialist Worker\u00d5s Party hecklers. Their posters are festooned with images of Hague under the banner: \"Stop this man playing the race card!\" </p> <p> Hague takes the platform mike and sticks it to Blair. \"All the opinion polls show that the vast majority of British people agree with us that we should be in Europe, but keep the pound. That is why, as part of our Common Sense Revolution, we have issued a Sterling Guarantee that means that people can be sure that a vote for the Conservative Party at the next election is a vote to keep the pound.\"</p> <p>As his aides crowd in on the SWP banner-holders, Hague takes questions. He is again a man at ease, enjoying the rollicking argument, the cut and thrust of hostile questions, and the soap-box politics. It is a genuine democratic moment. It\u00d5s not every day the citizens of Edinburgh get the chance in person to ask the Leader of the Opposition questions. </p> <p>At the end, we all get ready to slip away, but then the SWP contingent starts running after us in a pincer movement to block our exit up the steep embankment that leads to Princes Street. \"Stuff the racists, end the fear. Refugees are welcome here,\" they shout. What starts out as a brisk walk soon becomes a hurried trot. We make it through the narrow metal exit to Princes Street, once again a hurtling, 30-strong phalanx of human bodies. We dash over the road in front of hooting buses, but our pursuers follow. \"Hague, you are a disgrace!\" shouts one persistent Sinn Fein advocate of the Good Friday Agreement. We are chased along half the length of Princess Street to the refuge of Scottish Conservative Office, being spat at and abused. Once inside, everyone cracks jokes about jogging and trades heckler stories. There is a real air of relief as the Leader and his followers sit down for beer and lunch. </p> <p>Soon Hague will be off for another appointment in his constituency, another stage on what will, or will not, be his road to No10. Will William Hague become Prime Minister? Two months ago, the answer would have been easy \u00d1 no. He did not have a chance. Now that answer is less certain, and the battle lines are clearer. But I am still not really sure who William Hague is. The hours I spent in his company revealed not the substance of a man but rather the internal working of a political machine. The person inside that machine remained as remote and untouchable as that flickering image in our memories of the Tory Boy Wonder. There is only one certainty. William Hague is going to fight the next election in the only way he knows how, as a real Tory, not one of the fake, soppy, compassionate ones, and he is fighting to win.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Back at the hotel, there are more interviews. The Police Federation speech has led the One O\u00d5Clock News, and run big in the London Evening Standard. But there is trouble brewing. Straight away, the political editor of the Scottish Sun wants a line on the Mike Tyson row that has exploded into a constitutional battle between the Scottish Parliament, which wants to ban the convicted rapist from boxing in Scotland, and Jack Straw, who won\u00d5t exclude Tyson from the United Kingdom. The Tyson story is in danger of wiping out Hague\u00d5s visit to Scotland as a news item. There is a brief discussion about what line to take. There is no line, and Hague refuses to comment. Within a few minutes, the Scottish Sun man closes his notebook. Later, Amanda Platell explains the decision: if they comment on Tyson, they\u00d5ll just become part of the Tyson story. As it turns out, the Tyson row does kill media interest in Hague\u00d5s visit \u00d1 even the Scottish broadsheets relegate the story to page nine; the Scottish Sun carries nothing. Soon, we are back on the road again, to the Eastwood constituency dinner for Spanish melon, roast sirloin of beef and a rousing campaign speech by William for the 225 \u00a325-a-head members and guests at the concrete 60s Normandy Hotel, in the suburbs of Glasgow. It\u00d5s another stage for Hague, glad-handing, greeting, frozen smiles and pictures with a whole queue of Tory council candidates. Later, after his speech, as part of some other ritual, he will walk around alone and introduce himself to each table of seated diners. The road to Downing Street, it seems, is paved with social excruciation. Hague is an accomplished public speaker. His delivery is good, the comic timing spot on, and the cadences of rhetoric just right. He is a master of the big set-piece conference platform speech; his hands wave, he declaims, he cajoles. Tonight is a walk-over. Like all good after-dinner speakers, he starts off warming up the audience with a few jokes from old newspaper headlines \u00d1 \"Home Secretary to act on Porn Video\" \u00d1 and then hits with his big theme: Tony Blair is a fraud and the fortunes of the Tory Party can be revived. He is scathing: \"I know our chief opponent very well, because I have to ask him those questions every Wednesday afternoon. I have to get into the way he thinks, think the way he thinks, and how he will answer those questions. I know that he does not believe in anything at all. At the last election, that gave him an advantage; at the next election, it gives us an advantage.\" It was my first Conservative dinner, and it was a shock. The Party is old; most of the dinner guests were in their 70s. It was hard to believe that this Britain \u00d1 bouffant hair-dos, portly, uniformed chauffeurs, crinoline ball-gowns and floral prints \u00d1 still existed; Planet Tory. It was like stepping back into the 50s. One thing was sure, these people would not be knocking door to door at election time. At one table at the back was a small clique of young men from Glasgow University\u00d5s Conservative Society. They are strangely awkward, arrogant, odd-looking, dressed in clothes borrowed from their grandparents; young Williams revisited 20 years later. Hague is not a fretter. He sleeps soundly. He is genuinely confident and relentlessly optimistic about both the Tories\u00d5 and his own prospects. He runs the Tory party like a company. Meetings are short, brisk and decisive. He does not like endless argument, and when he reaches a position, he sticks with it. \"I like to hear the argument and then decide \u00d1 just sleep on it and know. It\u00d5s the same asking questions of the Prime Minister. Sometimes you can sit for hours thinking about the issues you could ask him about and working it all out \u00d1 the moves on the chessboard, as it were. But, actually, usually when I\u00d5ve really pinned him to the wall, it\u00d5s when I\u00d5ve woken up that morning and thought of something \u00d1 that is going to be the thing I nail him on today.\" In the morning, he does more radio and then drives to the outskirts of Edinburgh for a press conference on today\u00d5s theme: keeping the pound. It\u00d5s been raining, the hotel is cold, miserable. It\u00d5s a poor turnout from the press: Tyson 1, Hague 0. Clustered in a corner are another batch of the men who characteristically make up the political class of Britain. They stand around and smile, but their eyes are full of hunger for the glitter of attention as they watch the Leader being interviewed, again and again, by the few reporters who do turn up. The dominant emotion is not awe but envy. Among them stands Malcolm Rifkind, shorn of his former grandeur of power. He reminds me for all the world of my old Edinburgh dentist. It\u00d5s hard to believe he was once the British Foreign Secretary, and these the remnants of a political party that once ruled Britain. Hague is at home in this world, as much a creature of the Conservative Party as he is his father\u00d5s son. He inherited his politics from his father, Nigel, an instinctive Yorkshire Tory who ran a small soft-drinks company, Charles Hague &amp; Sons, manufacturing lemonade. Ironically, Hague is the first Tory leader ever to have gone to a state school. He was educated at Wath-on-Dearne Comprehensive in Rotherham, Yorkshire, whose social mix included the sons of miners and steelworkers, after rejecting a scholarship to a state boarding school, Ripon Grammar, 30 miles from home. Hague got four As at A-Level and went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in, predictably, Politics, Philosophy and Economics, as well as being president of the Oxford Union. He has a further diploma from the prestigious INSEAD French institute. For five years, Hague was a management consultant with McKinsey, but that was just his day job. According to his CV, even as he worked at McKinsey, he was already political adviser to Geoffrey Howe and Leon Brittan in the Thatcher Government.

      "byline": "Christopher Lloyd",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Perennials, I remarked last week, are not, on the whole, strongly designed. Many tend to be hazy and structureless. Gypsophilas, for instance, linums, most lychnis, cranesbills, asters, day lilies, spiderworts, phloxes... I could run on. </p> <p>But some are helpful in this respect, and they will be especially valuable in perennial borders where you don't want shrubs. It would be better if you would keep an open mind on this question and grow a shrub among perennials if it seemed to you to look right in the context, but I shall here suppose that perennials, and perennials only, are your aim. </p> <p>Anything spiky with an upright thrust will look purposeful. Eremurus, the foxtail lilies, for instance. Their colours range from white through pale pink and yellow to soft orangey shades; their heights from 1m to 3m, and their season covers, between them, all of May and June. No one of them flowers for very long. They have fleshy roots and need good drainage. They like alkaline soils and are exciting to look at. Dying away completely from view in late summer, you need from the start to think of replacements in their vicinity. </p> <p> Verbascum chaixii (1.5m) seeded itself among mine, which was a good idea. It has more or less unbranched spikes of yellow or white flowers with purple stamens at the centre, flowering in July. All verbascums have a strong presence but some of the best are biennial. These self-sow. </p> <p>Kniphofias, the red-hot-pokers, are strongly spiky and always make an impression, although not one that everybody likes. Their strap leaves can be rather messy, as are those of day lilies and tradescantias, but are a distinct asset in Kniphofia caulescens, where they are glaucous and borne in rosettes. This is quite a variable species, some strains flowering in June, others not till September, in a soft orange-red. In 'Little Maid' (1m or less), the pokers are creamy white and prolific over quite a long, late-summer season, especially if you replant fairly frequently. </p> <p>I like the September-flowering 'Torchbearer' (2m), because there is quite a lot of green in its yellow colouring. Among the fieriest and most aggressive, but a fine landscape feature, is the August- flowering K. uvaria 'Nobilis' (3m). That is orange-coloured. </p> <p>I count Phormium as evergreen perennials, and their fans of tough leaves are generally the principal asset. But some flower regularly in early summer, spiky at first, rather like a heron's neck and beak; then branching as the muted, greenish-yellow flowers develop. Hardiest and most reliable, in my estimation, is P. cookianum 'Tricolor' (2m in flower, half as high in leaf). The strap leaves are curved and combine strips of purple (at the margins), green and cream. The flowering stems in June are generously borne. </p> <p>When flowers or leaves are borne in whorled tiers, they always agreeably draw attention to themselves. Thus, in Veronicastrum virginicum (1.5m), whose spiky flowers are a rather dusty purple, and the more popular white album, there is a great build-up beneath the flowers of whorled lance-leaves. In Phlomis russeliana (1.2m), the tiered whorls are of dusky-yellow labiate flowers, which show up at a distance as strong shapes. </p> <p>On the other hand, the flat, cow parsley-style corymbs of many umbellifers draw our attention in a different way, and they often have a branching inflorescence that is strong on presentation. Among the handsomest are any species in the genus Ferula of the giant fennels.

      "bodyText": "Perennials, I remarked last week, are not, on the whole, strongly designed. Many tend to be hazy and structureless. Gypsophilas, for instance, linums, most lychnis, cranesbills, asters, day lilies, spiderworts, phloxes... I could run on. But some are helpful in this respect, and they will be especially valuable in perennial borders where you don't want shrubs. It would be better if you would keep an open mind on this question and grow a shrub among perennials if it seemed to you to look right in the context, but I shall here suppose that perennials, and perennials only, are your aim. Anything spiky with an upright thrust will look purposeful. Eremurus, the foxtail lilies, for instance. Their colours range from white through pale pink and yellow to soft orangey shades; their heights from 1m to 3m, and their season covers, between them, all of May and June. No one of them flowers for very long. They have fleshy roots and need good drainage. They like alkaline soils and are exciting to look at. Dying away completely from view in late summer, you need from the start to think of replacements in their vicinity. Verbascum chaixii (1.5m) seeded itself among mine, which was a good idea. It has more or less unbranched spikes of yellow or white flowers with purple stamens at the centre, flowering in July. All verbascums have a strong presence but some of the best are biennial. These self-sow. Kniphofias, the red-hot-pokers, are strongly spiky and always make an impression, although not one that everybody likes. Their strap leaves can be rather messy, as are those of day lilies and tradescantias, but are a distinct asset in Kniphofia caulescens, where they are glaucous and borne in rosettes. This is quite a variable species, some strains flowering in June, others not till September, in a soft orange-red. In 'Little Maid' (1m or less), the pokers are creamy white and prolific over quite a long, late-summer season, especially if you replant fairly frequently. I like the September-flowering 'Torchbearer' (2m), because there is quite a lot of green in its yellow colouring. Among the fieriest and most aggressive, but a fine landscape feature, is the August- flowering K. uvaria 'Nobilis' (3m). That is orange-coloured. I count Phormium as evergreen perennials, and their fans of tough leaves are generally the principal asset. But some flower regularly in early summer, spiky at first, rather like a heron's neck and beak; then branching as the muted, greenish-yellow flowers develop. Hardiest and most reliable, in my estimation, is P. cookianum 'Tricolor' (2m in flower, half as high in leaf). The strap leaves are curved and combine strips of purple (at the margins), green and cream. The flowering stems in June are generously borne. When flowers or leaves are borne in whorled tiers, they always agreeably draw attention to themselves. Thus, in Veronicastrum virginicum (1.5m), whose spiky flowers are a rather dusty purple, and the more popular white album, there is a great build-up beneath the flowers of whorled lance-leaves. In Phlomis russeliana (1.2m), the tiered whorls are of dusky-yellow labiate flowers, which show up at a distance as strong shapes. On the other hand, the flat, cow parsley-style corymbs of many umbellifers draw our attention in a different way, and they often have a branching inflorescence that is strong on presentation. Among the handsomest are any species in the genus Ferula of the giant fennels. They have wonderfully dissect foliage but rise, on flowering, way above this, often to 3m, the domed flower heads themselves being greeny-yellow. Any Ferula will give pleasure in the first half of the year and flowering will be most generous if the plants are well fed, although in nature they may grow on arid, hungry slopes. In this respect, ecology is not the best guide. Alliums, with their domed heads above naked scapes, make themselves noticed, especially the larger-headed kinds, such as Allium giganteum (1.5m), which is lilac-mauve, and A. cristophii (1m), whose globes of spiky stars start a light shade of purple. That seeds itself right through my borders, and it is the best way to see these alliums. On a recent visit to Germany, I was impressed by the strong clumps of A. multibulbosum (1m), with flowers in white domes. Multibulbosum does sound a bit threatening, however, as though it might take one over, as some alliums do. A panicle of blossom can make a good impression from a distance. Red valerian, Centranthus ruber, does this, whether red or white, but I would avoid the rather dirty pink-red strain. It is a great self-seeder, but it is best to cut back the first flush of blossom now, before it has sown itself everywhere. In our southern counties, there will be a second flush in September. The moisture-loving rodgersias are grown mainly, I suppose, for their bold foliage, but some of them flower most handsomely, with large panicles, if grown in good soil. Rodgersia podophylla (1m) is a shy flowerer but most of the others are pretty free, generally white but sometimes pink, as in certain strains of R. pinnata.

In a clear rebuke to Mr Cook, Downing Street insisted that Tony Blair did not believe it was inevitable that Britain would join. The prime minister's spokesman said: \"It's our objective to join a successful single currency, providing the economic conditions are met. It is not inevitable but it's our objective.\" The intervention by Downing Street came as the European central bank president, Wim Duisenberg, fuelled cabinet divisions over the euro by declaring that Britain had met all but one of the conditions for entry. Mr Duisenberg, who said recently that \"psycho-political\" worries were blocking entry, said that the British economy was \"suffering greatly\" by remaining outside euroland. His remarks will be welcomed by the cabinet's pro-euro wing, led by Mr Cook, whose members believe that the government must step up its \"prepare and decide\" policy. The foreign secretary attempted to widen the boundaries of the cabinet's euro policy on Thursday when he said that Britain would eventually join the single currency. Asked about recent opinion polls on the euro, Mr Cook said he welcomed figures which showed that most people believe that membership of the single currency was inevitable. \"I think they are right,\" he said. His remarks came close to defying the cabinet's agreed policy on the euro, which says that the government will hold a referendum on membership only if a series of economic tests have been met. Gordon Brown, who is the foreign secretary's main foe over the issue, believes that the government should not allow the general election campaign to be distracted by the euro. The position of the pro-euro ministers was strengthened yesterday when Mr Duisenberg said that Britain had met the criteria for membership set out in the Maastricht treaty on inflation, public sector debt and long term interest rates. The only exception was the exchange rate. \"The performance of the British economy is admirable, but it is suffering greatly because it is not participating in the euro - that said, the decision is for the British people,\" Mr Duisenberg told the Italian newspaper Il Sole.

      "body": "<p>County cricket's outgrounds, with their geographical whims, diverse charms and impracticalities, have almost gone forever. They are among the game's anachronisms, rejected by the cold eyes of the accountants. But Rutland, of all places, is discounting the trend with picturesque defiance. </p> <p>The last time a championship match was played here was in 1938. That was when Les Berry, the Bristol Rovers goalkeeper, and Leicestershire's New Zealand test player CS Dempster scored 180 for the first wicket. </p> <p>It was there, three years earlier, that Tich Freeman tossed the twirling ball up into the clouds to take eight for 123. It was also where a callow 16-year-old George Dawkes made his unexpected debut and where yesterday, just short of his 80th birthday, he returned as a guest of the county club. </p> <p>The pavilion now lacks its thatched roof but the outfield, tended lovingly by the groundsman Keith Exton, remains a table of billiards-baize perfection, even though the boys play rugby on part of it.

      "bodyText": "County cricket's outgrounds, with their geographical whims, diverse charms and impracticalities, have almost gone forever. They are among the game's anachronisms, rejected by the cold eyes of the accountants. But Rutland, of all places, is discounting the trend with picturesque defiance. The last time a championship match was played here was in 1938. That was when Les Berry, the Bristol Rovers goalkeeper, and Leicestershire's New Zealand test player CS Dempster scored 180 for the first wicket. It was there, three years earlier, that Tich Freeman tossed the twirling ball up into the clouds to take eight for 123. It was also where a callow 16-year-old George Dawkes made his unexpected debut and where yesterday, just short of his 80th birthday, he returned as a guest of the county club. The pavilion now lacks its thatched roof but the outfield, tended lovingly by the groundsman Keith Exton, remains a table of billiards-baize perfection, even though the boys play rugby on part of it. And the strip itself, immaculate and loftily praised, is an argument Leicestershire have decided they cannot ignore. When Surrey, after winning the toss, lost their first three wickets for 25 - all to James Ormond - this argument seemed momentarily suspect. Mark Butcher went in the opening over; Ian Ward soon followed and Adam Hollioake was well held, just off the ground at second slip, by Chris Lewis.

McDermott then clipped Courtney Walsh firmly off his legs for what would have been the winning runs had not Richie Richardson, intuitively, just moved Desmond Haynes back from short leg. The fielder dived, stopped the runs and fended off defeat. </p> <p>Then it happened. From deep in his resolve, Walsh dredged up a bouncer to McDermott who jerked his head back and tried to withdraw his bat.

Fletcher popped into the home dressing-room and demanded to know: \"Who is this bloke?\"</p> <p>\"Maybe it was one of those quirks of fate that Fletcher was there,\" concedes Graham Rose, Somerset's senior pro. \"But just as being appointed vice-captain here was a boost for him last year, getting on an A tour as a result of that innings was just what he needed - a show of faith.\"</p> <p>If the tour did not prove fruitful, team-mates, significantly, praised his spirit and infectious bonhomie, a recurrent theme. The same goes for the tingling anticipation he inspires whenever he lugs that deceptively cumbersome frame to the crease.</p> <p>\"He has to be more consistent, concentrate harder, get that front foot further forward,\" Reeve charged in April, sentiments Trescothick was quick to echo. The statistics mirror the strides, not so much that 45.30 championship average this season - he began term with a mean of under 30 - as the sedate progress: 44.49 runs per 100 balls, less than half his National League rate. Rugged run-a-ball roust-abouts now mingle with stoic six-hour sojourns. Slowly but surely the value of alternative approaches has dawned.</p> <p>Nor should his bowling be sniffed at. An unprepossessing seamer fond of a wickedly teasing variation that emerges from the back of a meaty right hand, he has claimed 13 one-day victims in 55 overs this season. Lara and co could be right up his street.</p> <p>To describe Trescothick as a lover of all things flanneled and foolish would do his passion a disservice. Having spent winters honing his skills with vice and plane, he quite fancies becoming a batmaker. \"He's also a bit of a kit freak,\" says Rose. \"As soon as he sees somebody has something new he's over there, feeling a bat, smelling a fresh pair of gloves.\" Small wonder his girlfriend plays for Somerset Ladies.</p> <p>Transferring such zeal to the loftiest stage has been beyond far too many Englishmen of late to be confident that Trescothick will buck the trend over the coming fortnight. But of one thing there can be no doubt: balls will be bruised.</p>",

Fletcher popped into the home dressing-room and demanded to know: \"Who is this bloke?\" \"Maybe it was one of those quirks of fate that Fletcher was there,\" concedes Graham Rose, Somerset's senior pro. \"But just as being appointed vice-captain here was a boost for him last year, getting on an A tour as a result of that innings was just what he needed - a show of faith.\" If the tour did not prove fruitful, team-mates, significantly, praised his spirit and infectious bonhomie, a recurrent theme. The same goes for the tingling anticipation he inspires whenever he lugs that deceptively cumbersome frame to the crease. \"He has to be more consistent, concentrate harder, get that front foot further forward,\" Reeve charged in April, sentiments Trescothick was quick to echo. The statistics mirror the strides, not so much that 45.30 championship average this season - he began term with a mean of under 30 - as the sedate progress: 44.49 runs per 100 balls, less than half his National League rate. Rugged run-a-ball roust-abouts now mingle with stoic six-hour sojourns. Slowly but surely the value of alternative approaches has dawned. Nor should his bowling be sniffed at. An unprepossessing seamer fond of a wickedly teasing variation that emerges from the back of a meaty right hand, he has claimed 13 one-day victims in 55 overs this season. Lara and co could be right up his street. To describe Trescothick as a lover of all things flanneled and foolish would do his passion a disservice. Having spent winters honing his skills with vice and plane, he quite fancies becoming a batmaker. \"He's also a bit of a kit freak,\" says Rose. \"As soon as he sees somebody has something new he's over there, feeling a bat, smelling a fresh pair of gloves.\" Small wonder his girlfriend plays for Somerset Ladies. Transferring such zeal to the loftiest stage has been beyond far too many Englishmen of late to be confident that Trescothick will buck the trend over the coming fortnight. But of one thing there can be no doubt: balls will be bruised.",

      "body": "<p>The potential for Kevin Keegan to throw his toys out of the pram will be tested further today when he is due to face more criticism of his England record from within the Football Association. </p> <p>Today's summer meeting of English football's governing body will hear a number of worried FA councillors voicing their concerns over Keegan's failure in Euro 2000, and in particular his perceived lack of tactical nous. </p> <p>However, Keegan can take some comfort from the fact that FA members do recognise that deeper, underlying factors have contributed to England's embarrassing recent record, and high on their list of suspects is the thorny issue of foreign players. </p> <p>Keegan articulated his worries on this issue when he forecast soon after taking over the national reins that the day may soon come when he has to pick the bulk of his squad from the First Division. </p> <p>So, while recent reports of record foreign investment into Britain pleased the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in football circles great horror greeted the posting of last season's record import figures - a record which, judging by events in the transfer market so far , will not stand for long. </p> <p>At the end of last season there were 170 European Union and 39 non-EU players on the books of the 20 Premiership clubs - that is an average of 10 per club. \"It was the most there's ever been and the number seems to be increasing,\" said a Premier League spokeswoman yes- terday. </p> <p>Chelsea even famously fielded the first all-foreign XI and, though Gianluca Vialli suggested he would buy British this summer - and despite attempts by Fifa and Uefa to get the Bosman ruling modified - Chelsea's outlook, like those of other Premiership clubs, has remained distinctly unpatriotic. </p> <p>Although the summer clearout at relegated Wimbledon has seen Neil Sullivan and, possibly, Ben Thatcher join Spurs and the \u00a37m Carl Cort move to Newcastle, few other home-grown players have needed to trouble their agents about a transfer to the Premiership. </p> <p>The main movers have been foreign: Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to Chelsea for \u00a315m, Sergei Rebrov to Spurs for \u00a311m, Olivier Dacourt to Leeds for \u00a37m, Robert Pires and Lauren Mayer to Arsenal for \u00a36m and \u00a37m respectively, Sylvain Wiltord possibly going to Highbury for \u00a315m. And on and on. </p> <p>The victims here are well known: young English talent. On Thursday Manchester United's promising home-grown defender Danny Higginbotham became the latest player to be pushed out of the nest. Aged 21, and fed up with waiting for his chance in the United first team, he has left Old Trafford in search of top- level football and the fulfilment of a potential recognised even by Sir Alex Ferguson. </p> <p>As his new manager Jim Smith of Derby explained: \"Danny wants to get on and play for England, which Alex believes he has a chance of doing.\" </p> <p>The players themselves recognise the problem. Higginbotham's former team-mate Ryan Giggs said recently: \"I think something's got to be done. If you ask any player, they'll say the same thing. There's no problem when you're bringing in quality players. But then you've got mediocre players coming in while there are plenty of 18- and 19-year-olds who could do the job.\" </p> <p>However, the idea of foreign quotas is unpopular with those who count: the clubs. They like the fact that, in general, foreign players are cheaper. And, as for the managers, the demands on them are for instant success, so they have no time to wait for home-grown youngsters to mature. Scared to chance them in first- team football, managers collude in hindering their development even further. And so the next generation soon becomes the ex-generation. </p> <p> From an England point of view, who knows what damage has been done to young Higginbotham's international development by being stuck in United's reserves for so long. What now for Alan Smith, the 19-year-old striker at Leeds following the recent signing of Mark Viduka from Celtic? And how, for instance, can England hope to nurture a decent midfield playmaker when the bulk of the creative work in the Premiership is done by foreigners? </p> <p>Of course there have long been problems getting England to perform, going back years before the foreign invasion hit these shores. To that extent, the enigma that is the England team can be explained only partly by the large number of non-English players in the Premiership. </p> <p>But, as Keegan earlier acknowledged, the warning signs are there. If the country thinks the England team is bad now, wait until the centre-half comes from Stockport County and the midfield playmaker from Grimsby Town. </p> <p><strong> Arsenal</strong><br> </p> <p>

      "bodyText": "The potential for Kevin Keegan to throw his toys out of the pram will be tested further today when he is due to face more criticism of his England record from within the Football Association. Today's summer meeting of English football's governing body will hear a number of worried FA councillors voicing their concerns over Keegan's failure in Euro 2000, and in particular his perceived lack of tactical nous. However, Keegan can take some comfort from the fact that FA members do recognise that deeper, underlying factors have contributed to England's embarrassing recent record, and high on their list of suspects is the thorny issue of foreign players. Keegan articulated his worries on this issue when he forecast soon after taking over the national reins that the day may soon come when he has to pick the bulk of his squad from the First Division. So, while recent reports of record foreign investment into Britain pleased the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in football circles great horror greeted the posting of last season's record import figures - a record which, judging by events in the transfer market so far , will not stand for long. At the end of last season there were 170 European Union and 39 non-EU players on the books of the 20 Premiership clubs - that is an average of 10 per club. \"It was the most there's ever been and the number seems to be increasing,\" said a Premier League spokeswoman yes- terday.

      "trailText": "<p>Charles Dempsey had always been a difficult customer as far as the South Africans were concerned during their three and a half years of campaigning to try to land the World Cup.\n</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Charles Dempsey had always been a difficult customer as far as the South Africans were concerned during their three and a half years of campaigning to try to land the World Cup. </p> <p>Little did they realise, however, that in doing nothing during the final round of voting in Zurich on Thursday afternoon Dempsey had done so much to damage the progress of African football.</p> <p>A day before Thursday's executive committee election it became apparent to the South Africans that one vote could prove crucial. Most analysts had predicted a close competition which would probably be decided by the casting vote of Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, and so Dempsey's vote was more important than ever. In the event the Oceania representative's vote would have ensured a 12-12 tie; Blatter, meanwhile, had already announced his support for South Africa.</p> <p>South African delegates were aware that, despite instructions from his confederation to vote for them, Dempsey was not keen on seeing the World Cup being staged there. During intense lobbying in the years leading up to the election, Dempsey had proved the most distant and awkward of the 24 Fifa executive committee members.</p> <p>Before Thursday's vote officials from Oceania were contacted by South African campaigners in an attempt to apply some last-minute pressure on the wavering Dempsey. Oceania officials in Zurich for the vote were also contacted and urged to call Dempsey to reiterate the importance of casting his vote.</p> <p>Up until 5am on Thursday Dempsey received numerous calls from New Zealand and from fellow Oceania delegates in Zurich. There is not believed to have been any direct contact between South African campaigners and Dempsey in the hours leading up to the vote. Most of the calls he received came from Oceania representatives in New Zealand who kept him up most of the night repeating instructions that he had to vote for South Africa once England were knocked out.</p> <p>The Oceania decision to back South Africa after England was taken at a meeting in Samoa in May, but doubts continued to linger over whether Dempsey would carry out his duty. Privately, some felt that he was going to back Germany even before the abstention.</p> <p>Danny Jordaan, the head of South Africa's bid, does not deny that last-minute pressure was applied to Dempsey and concedes that the South Africans were in constant contact with New Zealand, from where most of the telephone lobbying took place. Ironically, Dempsey cited the constant late-night calls and the intense pressure he was under as one of the reasons for his abstention.</p> <p>But Jordaan said: \"To be a Fifa member logically demands that you are able to take pressure at the national level. Pressure is part of the job. We were in touch with the Oceania federation, not just before the election but throughout the campaign.\"</p> <p>Relations between Dempsey and the South African campaign deteriorated sometime last year. It is not exactly known why Dempsey was so unenthusiastic about the African bid but he turned down several invitations to visit the country and view first hands its plans for the World Cup. At one stage, Nelson Mandela personally telephoned Dempsey in an attempt to win him over and invite him to the country but this was also rejected.</p> <p>Dempsey, aged 78, cited his age and failing health as reasons for not being able to visit South Africa.

      "bodyText": "Charles Dempsey had always been a difficult customer as far as the South Africans were concerned during their three and a half years of campaigning to try to land the World Cup. Little did they realise, however, that in doing nothing during the final round of voting in Zurich on Thursday afternoon Dempsey had done so much to damage the progress of African football. A day before Thursday's executive committee election it became apparent to the South Africans that one vote could prove crucial. Most analysts had predicted a close competition which would probably be decided by the casting vote of Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, and so Dempsey's vote was more important than ever. In the event the Oceania representative's vote would have ensured a 12-12 tie; Blatter, meanwhile, had already announced his support for South Africa. South African delegates were aware that, despite instructions from his confederation to vote for them, Dempsey was not keen on seeing the World Cup being staged there. During intense lobbying in the years leading up to the election, Dempsey had proved the most distant and awkward of the 24 Fifa executive committee members. Before Thursday's vote officials from Oceania were contacted by South African campaigners in an attempt to apply some last-minute pressure on the wavering Dempsey. Oceania officials in Zurich for the vote were also contacted and urged to call Dempsey to reiterate the importance of casting his vote. Up until 5am on Thursday Dempsey received numerous calls from New Zealand and from fellow Oceania delegates in Zurich. There is not believed to have been any direct contact between South African campaigners and Dempsey in the hours leading up to the vote. Most of the calls he received came from Oceania representatives in New Zealand who kept him up most of the night repeating instructions that he had to vote for South Africa once England were knocked out. The Oceania decision to back South Africa after England was taken at a meeting in Samoa in May, but doubts continued to linger over whether Dempsey would carry out his duty. Privately, some felt that he was going to back Germany even before the abstention. Danny Jordaan, the head of South Africa's bid, does not deny that last-minute pressure was applied to Dempsey and concedes that the South Africans were in constant contact with New Zealand, from where most of the telephone lobbying took place. Ironically, Dempsey cited the constant late-night calls and the intense pressure he was under as one of the reasons for his abstention. But Jordaan said: \"To be a Fifa member logically demands that you are able to take pressure at the national level. Pressure is part of the job. We were in touch with the Oceania federation, not just before the election but throughout the campaign.\" Relations between Dempsey and the South African campaign deteriorated sometime last year. It is not exactly known why Dempsey was so unenthusiastic about the African bid but he turned down several invitations to visit the country and view first hands its plans for the World Cup. At one stage, Nelson Mandela personally telephoned Dempsey in an attempt to win him over and invite him to the country but this was also rejected. Dempsey, aged 78, cited his age and failing health as reasons for not being able to visit South Africa. But, as president of Fifa's most far-flung federation, Dempsey is one of the organisation's most travelled members. Over the last three years he has clocked up almost 1m miles on football-related work, but he never made it to South Africa. Born in Glasgow in 1922, Dempsey emigrated to New Zealand in 1952 where he established a successful construction business. During the second world war he served as a petty officer in the navy. In Scotland Dempsey played for Milnegavie Amateurs, just outside Glasgow, and he also represented the Royal Navy team in England and West Africa during the war. Prior to emigrating he played briefly for Gillingham. Dempsey has played a crucial role in the development of football in New Zealand and in the establishment of Oceania, formally recognised by Fifa in 1966. New Zealand's qualification for the 1982 World Cup was seen as Dempsey's ultimate achievement after dedicating years to the game in a country dominated by rugby. But, despite his impressive track record as an administrator, he will ultimately be remembered as the man who killed the African dream.",

Given the total failure of service-station catering facilities to produce stuff (the word food is too precise to use in this context) that is anything other than utterly disgusting and outrageously priced, the need for such a guide remains as imperative as ever.

It took a colossal effort of will to turn off the M6 at exit 27, turn right at the first roundabout, continue for another three miles, keeping an eye peeled for the sign of the Mulberry Tree. Should you do so, too, however, you will find the minimal effort amply rewarded - with the emphasis both on the amplitude as well as on the reward. </p> <p>There is something so instantly, utterly, distinctively Lancastrian about the whole enterprise. It breathes a jolly generosity mixed with confident commercial instinct. Refined it is not. Designer-driven it is not. A little bit brash it may be. But warm, and well-run, well-priced and well-aimed it undoubtedly is. The large ground-floor area is sort of open-plan, with cream-and-white walls, fake beams, the odd strip of anaglypta and mulberry-tree motif carpet. During the week, it has a bar menu, with proper dishes as well as sandwiches ranging from \u00a33.50 to \u00a38.95, and on Sunday it does the full lunch and dinner effort, with one course for \u00a39, two for \u00a312 and three for \u00a315. I don't suppose that I have to tell you that I had three courses. </p> <p>One of the reasons that I was keen to give the Mulberry Tree a go was the fact that it is the latest port of call of Mark Prescott, who once graced the kitchens of Le Gavroche, and then took the White Hart at Nayland, Suffolk, to culinary heights as one of the early gastro-pubs. He is a cook with pedigree and gravitas, who has opted for the relaxed and informal cheer of the pub over the demands of fine dining. Aside from that, he is a Lancastrian to boot. </p> <p>I must admit that I find the combination of classically-trained skills applied to the simpler, more immediate demands of pub food tremendously appealing. It is interesting how many of our best and brightest chefs are finding the rewards of upgrading the standards of pub food preferable to hacking it in the torture chambers that are aiming for the stars. The general eating public is the beneficiary of this culinary vision. </p> <p>The Sunday menu at the Mulberry Tree runs through a good many standards of modern cookery. There are Thai fishcakes and chicken-liver parfaits, confits of duck and rib-eye steaks. More interestingly, there was a white-onion soup with tarragon cream, a breast of chicken tikka massala, steak-and-kidney pudding, and a boneless saddle of lamb stuffed with spinach. </p> <p>Dining alone, and scarcely recovered from lunch with some too, too hospitable friends, I made one of my rare sallies into the world of soups, but followed this up with slow-roasted belly-pork with spiced apple from the day's specials, and settled down to nougat glac\u00e9 with raspberry coulis at the end. This is where the superior skills pay off in the pub context. The white-onion soup was faultless, smooth as velvet, delicate and mild, with a froth of tarragon cream pointing up the haunting sweetness of white onion. The belly-pork had been slow-roasted to unctuous, fibrous softness (which, unfortunately, extended to the crackling). The apple, lodged as a layer under the crackling, was suitably tart and breathily spicy. The potent, mahogany-brown gravy and mixed veg gave the whole plate a bit of the Sunday-lunch-at-home feel, and there was no need for seconds. The nougat glac\u00e9 was marvellously nutty, if a little sweet for my taste. </p> <p>There is tolerable beer, but I was drawn to a bottle of one of the nouvelle vague Viogniers at an undemonstrative \u00a314.50 (I drank only two glasses - some readers take a kindly interest in my health, not to mention my postprandial driving abilities) from a very interesting and amiably-priced list. My notes at the time summarised the Mulberry Tree as follows: \"You can eat lots for little. Tasty, too. A good place; and only 5 mins from the Mway.\" On reflection, that's just about bang on.</p>",

      "body": "<p> A decade ago, while Stuart Hall was teaching at the Open University, he began to be inundated with tempting offers of lucrative chairs at US universities. But the professor, a beacon of inspirational mentoring on TV in the small hours, chose to stay in Britain.</p> <p> \"From the Caribbean to England is one huge cultural gulf; did I really feel like crossing another?\" he says. \"America is an imperial culture now; it's what Rome must have felt like, or England in the 19th century. But I feel better taking a sighting on the world from the periphery than the centre.\" </p> <p>Hall's sightings from the peripheries of colonial Jamaica, which he left almost 50 years ago, nascent black Britain and an England in post-imperial decline have not only helped to redefine the relationship of culture to power but to rewrite what he calls \"the margins into the centre, the outside into the inside\", in a \"more global version of our island story\". </p> <p>He challenges others, as he did the culture secretary, Chris Smith, at an Arts Council discussion of \"heritage\" last November, to re-imagine Britishness or Englishness itself \"in a more profoundly inclusive manner\". </p> <p>Harvard's head of African-American studies, Henry Louis Gates, named Hall in the New Yorker as \"black Britain's leading theorist of black Britain\". But Hall, an icon for black British artists and intellectuals over 35 years, not only traces Britain's transformation by post-war migrants, but tilts at myths about the society into which they came. </p> <p>Questioning both the idea of a single way of being black, and of a fixed, white \"majority culture\", he holds up a different mirror to that envisioned by many Britons, black and white. </p> <p>\"Britain is not homogeneous; it never was a society without conflict,\" he says. \"The English fought tooth and nail over everything we know of as the English political virtues - rule of law, free speech, the franchise. The very notion of Great Britain's 'greatness' is bound up with empire. Euroscepticism and Little Englander nationalism could hardly survive if people understood whose sugar has flowed through English blood and rotted English teeth. They are us and we are them. This never was a tiny, self-sufficient island.\" </p> <p>Retired from the Open University in 1997, and now an emeritus professor, Hall sits on the Runnymede Trust's commission on the future of multi-ethnic Britain, which reports this autumn. \"One of the most important debates over the last 20 years has been what does it mean to be English, and the relationship to declining imperial power: what it is to have been master of the world, and now second-rate, underpins so many social events - from the Falklands to football hooliganism.\" </p> <p>At 68, arthritis doesn't seem to have diminished Hall's energy, whether \"conversing\" with his grandson Noah, who is nearly two, or leading the way to his attic study in West Hampstead with the aid of a stick.

Hall's mother, Jessie, \"was from a completely different class fraction; only two generations from some white forebears\". Her family lacked \"the money to go with their status\" so she was adopted by a lawyer uncle and moved to a big house in Port Antonio (now owned by Eartha Kitt) with a \"palm-fringed drive by the sea\". </p> <p>\"This gave her peculiar airs and graces as the adopted daughter of a landowner, whereas my father was more an aspiring local boy.

He chose his own friends. \"My mother was an extraordinarily powerful person; she devoured us.

But it was three years after the Empire Windrush had disgorged its cargo of West Indian immigrants, and in the streets of Paddington that first \"terribly grey and gloomy\" August day, he remembers \"groups of black men in hats, who weren't students but working people, and women in their finery, dressed up to travel\".</p> <p> A Rhodes scholar in English, he survived the shock of Oxford's medieval gloom by befriending Americans and other West Indians, \"huddled together to make sense of England\". </p> <p>He played jazz piano with a group including two Jamaican bus drivers, and, as the Bajan writer George Lamming put it, \"became West Indian\" in Britain, saturating himself in anti-colonial politics with diverse islanders - though he recalls one aloof Trinidadian contemporary, VS Naipaul, who \"wasn't interested in affirming a West Indian consciousness; he was on different tracks\".</p> <p> As a postgraduate scholar Hall became involved with an anti-Stalinist, independent left.

People identified it with classically English figures: Edward Thompson, Raymond Williams - though he was Welsh. But looking back, our orientation was driven by voices that didn't quite fit in: foreigners from Sudan, Syria, west Africa, the West Indies, Jewish or provincial, Scottish, Irish.\" </p> <p>Hall had abandoned his thesis on Henry James, and worked as a supply teacher in Brixton, south London. Michael Rustin, who became his brother-in-law and co-edits Soundings magazine with him, recalls \"an air of excitement with the coming together of the old left and a younger generation where everything was being connected up: there was cinema, with Lindsay Anderson and Karel Reisz, and radical theatre, with Arnold Wesker\".</p> <p> Hall says: \"I'd always gone to the movies as a child; I saw every 40s melodrama, every Bogart and Bette Davis. I became interested in the impact of television, new mass magazines, teenage culture.\" </p> <p>After editing New Left Review for two years, he left in 1961 to teach film and allied media (\"no one would dare put television in the title\") at Chelsea College, and remembers lecturing on westerns in Wandsworth prison (\"It was a riot, I loved it\"). He did research for the British Film Institute on how to teach popular culture, co-writing the innovative book The Popular Arts (1964). </p> <p>When Richard Hoggart founded the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University in 1964, he invited Hall to be its research fellow. Hoggart describes Hall as one of the best lecturers in England and an extraordinarily charismatic personality - \"he has a brilliant theoretic mind\".</p> <p> After Hoggart went to Unesco in 1968, Hall took over as director, staying till 1979, when he left to be sociology professor of the Open University. They were \"heady days\", Hall recalls. \"We made the curriculum up. It was the inauguration of, not a discipline, but a field of inquiry that, unlike fine art, is interested in how culture organises everyday life. </p> <p>It was a very creative moment.\" Noting the backlash from older disciplines, he concedes with a laugh: \"There is a ferocious amount of crap written in any field.\" But he adds: \"The way in which culture organises social practice has come to be seen as crucial.\"</p> <p> Hoggart's Uses Of Literacy (1957) was a pillar, along with the work of Raymond Williams and EP Thompson. Yet relatively ignored by the founding triumvirate was mass migration - which Hall has called \"the world historical event of late modernity\". </p> <p>Paul Gilroy, professor of African-American studies and sociology at Yale, says: \"Stuart was the fourth figure; his postcolonial formation and experience of migrancy, and his attention to race, gave the critical understanding of the workings of England a very different slant.\" </p> <p>Hall had met his wife-to-be, Catherine Barrett - now a social historian - on a CND march at Aldermaston: 13 years his junior, she was beginning a degree at Sussex. They married in 1964, and she transferred to Birmingham, where they went on to have two children: Rebecca, now doing a PhD on the \"mulatto\" in English fiction, and Jess, a cameraman. But the newly-weds arrived in the midst of the Smethwick by- election, when the Tory candidate unseated a minister with the slogan: \"If you want a nigger neighbour vote Labour.\" </p> <p>Hall says: \"Catherine and I, a mixed-race couple, were looking for cheap accommodation; it was a very unpleasant experience. I was aware of the bubbling up of race into politics. There were problems of housing, racial discrimination, policing, the 'sus' laws; a second generation feeling they neither belonged in England nor anywhere else; the influence of reggae and Rastafarianism. It was impossible to be active and alive in Birmingham without being drawn into all that.\" </p> <p>One seminal study arose from the \"moral panic\" over street crime, when three teenagers - one of whom was black - were given 10-year sentences for robbery. \"It triggered and was fed by wider fears - the youth revolution of the 60s and that Britain was being fundamentally changed by the presence of black people. It tapped into a long-term sense of decline. That's where we discover the question of Englishness as the central problem underlying British politics. </p> <p>I thought if some politician decided to speak to these unspoken fantasies and fears in a popular language, you'd have a major swing.\" It took until the late 70s for that politician to emerge. Policing The Crisis, co-written by Hall, was published in 1978, the year before Margaret Thatcher came to power. The book is widely seen as prescient about the drift into a \"law and order society\" and the advent of Thatcherism - what Hall came to call \"authoritarian populism\" - and its promise to put the \"great\" back into Britain.</p> <p> He wrote: \"Blacks become the bearers, the signifiers of the crisis of British society in the 1970s... the means by which the crisis is to be resolved - send it away.\" He feels the threat remains. \"That's what Hague is searching for - the remaining shoots of that feeling, which feeds Euroscepticism and the fear of asylum-seekers.\"</p> <p> Hall was accused of overplaying the ideological nature of Thatcherism. He responds: \"Look at politics now. The left was restructured from below by a cultural shift; it wasn't just economics. I feel real aggression about political commentators who poured scorn on the notion of a cultural shift governing politics, who said Thatcherism was a blip. Most would accept now that Thatcherism, and its embrace of neo-liberalism, was a watershed.\"</p> <p> New Times, the political movement Hall espoused with Martin Jacques and others in Marxism Today in the late 80s and early 90s, was attacked for learning too much from its opponents, not least in its embrace of consumerism. One of Hall's most per sistent critics, A Sivanandan of the Institute of Race Relations, called it \"Thatcherism in drag\". </p> <p>Hall says: \"It came out of impatience with the old left thinking it could take a stand on traditional working-class values when the right was making the running in its 'heartlands'. But it was a call to match the depth of ambition of change Thatcher tried to bring about, but from a different direction.\"</p> <p> Hall, who sees the Blair government as \"a historic opportunity lost\", criticised New Labour on the eve of its election in 1997. \"Tony Blair swallowed the message but forgot the tune,\" he says. Describing himself as an \"egalitarian moderniser\", he adds: \"I've been a kind of socialist all my life, but not what people would call a revolutionary. I've always been suspicious of the dream of remaking society in an instant.</p> <p> I'm interested in deep change, but I don't think intellectual work should be short-changed to prove a political point. To point towards complexity, ambiguity, unexpected consequences - that's intellectual vocation.\"</p> <p> At Birmingham, teachers and postgraduates worked together in a \"hothouse atmosphere\", radically rethinking the field by taking into account feminism or race politics. Angela McRobbie, now professor of communications at Goldsmith's College, London, says: \"Stuart was a figurehead who let you get on with it. </p> <p>He challenged the relations of power in academic life.\" Hall, though, has cited successive \"crises\" with each intake of students, and feminists' \"dawn raids\", as among his reasons for leaving in 1979.</p> <p> \"I lived with a feminist,\" he says. \"Catherine became involved in the new feminist movement, especially moving from active academic life to isolation at home with two children. We were anxious that feminist work be done at the centre, but that's different from rethinking cultural studies from a feminist viewpoint. We were three men - 'the bosses'. </p> <p>It drove me wild to be placed in that false position.\" McRobbie says: \"I was surprised Stuart seemed as hurt as he was. My memories were that everybody was in the firing line, but he felt he was being set up as a patriarch.\" The Open University seemed a natural home. </p> <p>\"My instincts were towards widening access to adult education. Birmingham was an intellectual elite, whereas the average age at the OU was 40, people who'd not been in a classroom since 16. It was an intellectual challenge.\" </p> <p>A colleague, David Held, now politics professor at the LSE, says: \"Stuart's an engaged public intellectual of a kind celebrated in Europe but of which the English are wrongly sceptical; a great communicator who shines on television and radio.\" Hall has not only taught media, but made astute use of it - from his BBC series on the Caribbean, Redemption Song, in the early 90s, to his relaxed eloquence on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in February.</p> <p> He dissected how black people are represented on TV in It Ain't Half Racist, Mum - shown as a BBC 2 Open Door programme in 1979 - and Black And White In Colour, and his influence has grown on both sides of the Atlantic. Hall told a gathering of the Caribbean Artists Movement in 1968: </p> <p>\"The task of any intellectual and any writer in relation to [the next generations of West Indians in Britain] is to help them see, clarify, speak, understand and name the process that they're going through.\"</p> <p> He believes that \"cultural identity is not fixed, it's always hybrid [but] it comes out of a very specific historical formation\", and he was possibly the first to appreciate the emerging hybrid identities of postwar Britain. He found a model in Caribbean culture: \"Was it true West Indians had an identity crisis - neither European nor African in a 'pure' sense? I've written about the syncretism and creolisation of Caribbean culture all my life.\" For him, black communities are not some \"ethnic minority culture\" apart, but \"in touch with their differences without being saturated by tradition; they are actively involved with every aspect of life around them, without the illusion of assimilation\".</p> <p> Gilane Tawadros, director of London's International Institute of Visual Arts (InIVA), which Hall chairs, says: \"Stuart has an extraordinary ability to articulate the experiences of first, second and third-generation black Britons, their complexities and dynamism. He understood early on that you can't look at them as isolated in the 'margins' but part of a global diaspora, and that their presence was not just a challenge to Britain but created a new kind of Britishness that's internationally celebrated.\" </p> <p> His ideas threw a lifeline to young artists. Tawadros adds: \"At a time when art institutions were trying to bottle up what it meant to be black British or Asian British, when artists were frustrated at having to describe their work in terms of its 'Africanness' or 'Asianness', Stuart said that that experience, and its artistic expression, are more ambivalent; they draw on many things. He paved the way for the confidence of a new generation of artists, including Chris Ofili and Steve McQueen.\"</p> <p> Hall took an early interest in diasporic artists in London, such as Ronald Moody, Aubrey Williams and Francis Souza, who he says have been \"quietly written out of the record; not British enough for the Tate, not interna tional enough for Bankside\". But he found growing affinities, and collaborated, with a younger generation, including the film makers Isaac Julien, John Akomfrah and Martina Attille; the visual artists Keith Piper and Sonia Boyce; and the photographers Mark Sealy, David A Bailey, Sunil Gupta and Ingrid Pollard.</p> <p> \"In the 80s black artists became preoccupied with identity, self-portraits, putting their own body in the frame,\" says Hall. \"I was writing about identity and they were practising it. Racism is not just in the streets, it's written into how people recognise themselves. It made me more alert to the way artistic work is exploratory space in which ideas work themselves out. It brought me in touch with a huge creative explosion in literature, art, film.\"</p> <p> In an influential talk at London's ICA in 1989, Hall insisted \"blackness\", far from being fixed in nature, was \"politically and culturally constructed\" - partly through unconscious desire, fantasy and memory. The same went for \"whiteness\": \"We are all ethnically located.\" He was criticised for accepting the fracturing of a politically united black front. He says: \"There is a danger of locking into ethnic enclaves, but also the possibility of making common cause. I'm interested in a politics that makes links without ignoring difference.\" </p> <p>His stand is credited with freeing artists to speak from, but not for, black experiences, and giving crucial impetus to developing art criticism. Kobena Mercer, of New York University, says: \"Stuart said films weren't good just because black people made them. It contributed to a culture of debate, not just celebration.\"</p> <p> Hall is a voice cautioning against an \"easy, celebratory spirit\", warning instead of \"hard, perhaps iron times to come\". In his view, Britain is at a crossroads, marked by the 1998 Windrush celebrations and the pathologies exposed by the 1999 Macpherson report. What he calls multicultural drift - \"the explosion of cultural diversity and difference which is our lived daily reality\" - is no guarantee of peace or justice without the political will to see it through.</p> <p> \"Is Britain going to accept its diversity and become more humane? We don't yet know,\" he says. \"Yes, things are better in some ways, but a lot of people feel left out. The five boys in the Stephen Lawrence case didn't have an O-level between them. People like them are not in the dot.com revolution. The only time they feel English is when they can kick shit out of the Dutch or the Belgians.</p> <p> If you're serious about a multicultural society, you would address the sense of alienation of white working-class people, who have to be won to a new conception of themselves where Britain's not lording it from a gunboat.\" \"I don't think identity's fixed, the real, true self,\" he reflects. \"It's constructed from historical processes: I'm the sum of that boy called a 'coolie', the Rhodes scholar, the socialist from Jamaica. Every identity that feels so solid is the result of excluding things you could have been. I go back to Jamaica and adore it, but I couldn't be a Jamaican. I ache for a parallel life I could have lived. I also couldn't disappear into Englishness. I understand Britain; but I'm only British in a hyphenated way.\" </p> <p>Hall feels a sense of homecoming - but never a settled one. \"I never called myself black because no one in the Caribbean did then. I've come home to an identity I was never allowed to settle for; discovering I've become something I was all the time: a black intellectual, a migrant... People who are 68 should feel the ground solid under their feet. But I'm not surprised it feels shifting; it's the diasporic fate. More and more people feel life in this way.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A decade ago, while Stuart Hall was teaching at the Open University, he began to be inundated with tempting offers of lucrative chairs at US universities. But the professor, a beacon of inspirational mentoring on TV in the small hours, chose to stay in Britain. \"From the Caribbean to England is one huge cultural gulf; did I really feel like crossing another?\" he says. \"America is an imperial culture now; it's what Rome must have felt like, or England in the 19th century. But I feel better taking a sighting on the world from the periphery than the centre.\" Hall's sightings from the peripheries of colonial Jamaica, which he left almost 50 years ago, nascent black Britain and an England in post-imperial decline have not only helped to redefine the relationship of culture to power but to rewrite what he calls \"the margins into the centre, the outside into the inside\", in a \"more global version of our island story\". He challenges others, as he did the culture secretary, Chris Smith, at an Arts Council discussion of \"heritage\" last November, to re-imagine Britishness or Englishness itself \"in a more profoundly inclusive manner\". Harvard's head of African-American studies, Henry Louis Gates, named Hall in the New Yorker as \"black Britain's leading theorist of black Britain\". But Hall, an icon for black British artists and intellectuals over 35 years, not only traces Britain's transformation by post-war migrants, but tilts at myths about the society into which they came. Questioning both the idea of a single way of being black, and of a fixed, white \"majority culture\", he holds up a different mirror to that envisioned by many Britons, black and white. \"Britain is not homogeneous; it never was a society without conflict,\" he says. \"The English fought tooth and nail over everything we know of as the English political virtues - rule of law, free speech, the franchise. The very notion of Great Britain's 'greatness' is bound up with empire. Euroscepticism and Little Englander nationalism could hardly survive if people understood whose sugar has flowed through English blood and rotted English teeth. They are us and we are them. This never was a tiny, self-sufficient island.\" Retired from the Open University in 1997, and now an emeritus professor, Hall sits on the Runnymede Trust's commission on the future of multi-ethnic Britain, which reports this autumn. \"One of the most important debates over the last 20 years has been what does it mean to be English, and the relationship to declining imperial power: what it is to have been master of the world, and now second-rate, underpins so many social events - from the Falklands to football hooliganism.\" At 68, arthritis doesn't seem to have diminished Hall's energy, whether \"conversing\" with his grandson Noah, who is nearly two, or leading the way to his attic study in West Hampstead with the aid of a stick. His agile mental leaps and easy laughter reveal a love of conversation. He receives a tribute later this month in a book of essays, Without Guarantees, edited by Paul Gilroy, Angela McRobbie - both former students - and Lawrence Grossberg. It is a mark of his influence that its contributors span the globe, from Australia and Italy to Mexico and Taiwan. While his own writings are diffuse - collaborative or found in copiously reprinted nuggets - Hall relishes his role as an \"enabler\" of others' work. His interests in cultural identity, race and ethnicity have come increasingly to the fore, but he was a pioneer of both Britain's new left in the 50s and the pathbreaking academic field of cultural studies that grew from it and is now burgeoning yet beleaguered, mocked for its meld of high theory and \"low\" culture - \"Gramsci meets Coronation Street\", as one cynic put it. Yet, today's \"commonsense\" recognition of the power of television and tabloids owes much to Hall. His lifelong insistence that institutions have their own cultures is enshrined in the notion of institutional racism in the Macpherson report, which came out of the inquiry into the killing of Stephen Lawrence. Hall was born in 1932 in Kingston, Jamaica, the youngest of three children. His father, Herman, was a scholarship boy who joined the United Fruit Company and became chief accountant.

They married in 1964, and she transferred to Birmingham, where they went on to have two children: Rebecca, now doing a PhD on the \"mulatto\" in English fiction, and Jess, a cameraman. But the newly-weds arrived in the midst of the Smethwick by- election, when the Tory candidate unseated a minister with the slogan: \"If you want a nigger neighbour vote Labour.\" Hall says: \"Catherine and I, a mixed-race couple, were looking for cheap accommodation; it was a very unpleasant experience. I was aware of the bubbling up of race into politics. There were problems of housing, racial discrimination, policing, the 'sus' laws; a second generation feeling they neither belonged in England nor anywhere else; the influence of reggae and Rastafarianism. It was impossible to be active and alive in Birmingham without being drawn into all that.\" One seminal study arose from the \"moral panic\" over street crime, when three teenagers - one of whom was black - were given 10-year sentences for robbery. \"It triggered and was fed by wider fears - the youth revolution of the 60s and that Britain was being fundamentally changed by the presence of black people. It tapped into a long-term sense of decline. That's where we discover the question of Englishness as the central problem underlying British politics. I thought if some politician decided to speak to these unspoken fantasies and fears in a popular language, you'd have a major swing.\" It took until the late 70s for that politician to emerge. Policing The Crisis, co-written by Hall, was published in 1978, the year before Margaret Thatcher came to power. The book is widely seen as prescient about the drift into a \"law and order society\" and the advent of Thatcherism - what Hall came to call \"authoritarian populism\" - and its promise to put the \"great\" back into Britain. He wrote: \"Blacks become the bearers, the signifiers of the crisis of British society in the 1970s... the means by which the crisis is to be resolved - send it away.\" He feels the threat remains. \"That's what Hague is searching for - the remaining shoots of that feeling, which feeds Euroscepticism and the fear of asylum-seekers.\" Hall was accused of overplaying the ideological nature of Thatcherism. He responds: \"Look at politics now. The left was restructured from below by a cultural shift; it wasn't just economics. I feel real aggression about political commentators who poured scorn on the notion of a cultural shift governing politics, who said Thatcherism was a blip. Most would accept now that Thatcherism, and its embrace of neo-liberalism, was a watershed.\" New Times, the political movement Hall espoused with Martin Jacques and others in Marxism Today in the late 80s and early 90s, was attacked for learning too much from its opponents, not least in its embrace of consumerism. One of Hall's most per sistent critics, A Sivanandan of the Institute of Race Relations, called it \"Thatcherism in drag\". Hall says: \"It came out of impatience with the old left thinking it could take a stand on traditional working-class values when the right was making the running in its 'heartlands'. But it was a call to match the depth of ambition of change Thatcher tried to bring about, but from a different direction.\" Hall, who sees the Blair government as \"a historic opportunity lost\", criticised New Labour on the eve of its election in 1997. \"Tony Blair swallowed the message but forgot the tune,\" he says. Describing himself as an \"egalitarian moderniser\", he adds: \"I've been a kind of socialist all my life, but not what people would call a revolutionary. I've always been suspicious of the dream of remaking society in an instant. I'm interested in deep change, but I don't think intellectual work should be short-changed to prove a political point. To point towards complexity, ambiguity, unexpected consequences - that's intellectual vocation.\" At Birmingham, teachers and postgraduates worked together in a \"hothouse atmosphere\", radically rethinking the field by taking into account feminism or race politics. Angela McRobbie, now professor of communications at Goldsmith's College, London, says: \"Stuart was a figurehead who let you get on with it. He challenged the relations of power in academic life.\" Hall, though, has cited successive \"crises\" with each intake of students, and feminists' \"dawn raids\", as among his reasons for leaving in 1979. \"I lived with a feminist,\" he says. \"Catherine became involved in the new feminist movement, especially moving from active academic life to isolation at home with two children. We were anxious that feminist work be done at the centre, but that's different from rethinking cultural studies from a feminist viewpoint. We were three men - 'the bosses'. It drove me wild to be placed in that false position.\" McRobbie says: \"I was surprised Stuart seemed as hurt as he was. My memories were that everybody was in the firing line, but he felt he was being set up as a patriarch.\" The Open University seemed a natural home. \"My instincts were towards widening access to adult education. Birmingham was an intellectual elite, whereas the average age at the OU was 40, people who'd not been in a classroom since 16. It was an intellectual challenge.\" A colleague, David Held, now politics professor at the LSE, says: \"Stuart's an engaged public intellectual of a kind celebrated in Europe but of which the English are wrongly sceptical; a great communicator who shines on television and radio.\" Hall has not only taught media, but made astute use of it - from his BBC series on the Caribbean, Redemption Song, in the early 90s, to his relaxed eloquence on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in February. He dissected how black people are represented on TV in It Ain't Half Racist, Mum - shown as a BBC 2 Open Door programme in 1979 - and Black And White In Colour, and his influence has grown on both sides of the Atlantic. Hall told a gathering of the Caribbean Artists Movement in 1968: \"The task of any intellectual and any writer in relation to [the next generations of West Indians in Britain] is to help them see, clarify, speak, understand and name the process that they're going through.\" He believes that \"cultural identity is not fixed, it's always hybrid [but] it comes out of a very specific historical formation\", and he was possibly the first to appreciate the emerging hybrid identities of postwar Britain. He found a model in Caribbean culture: \"Was it true West Indians had an identity crisis - neither European nor African in a 'pure' sense? I've written about the syncretism and creolisation of Caribbean culture all my life.\" For him, black communities are not some \"ethnic minority culture\" apart, but \"in touch with their differences without being saturated by tradition; they are actively involved with every aspect of life around them, without the illusion of assimilation\". Gilane Tawadros, director of London's International Institute of Visual Arts (InIVA), which Hall chairs, says: \"Stuart has an extraordinary ability to articulate the experiences of first, second and third-generation black Britons, their complexities and dynamism. He understood early on that you can't look at them as isolated in the 'margins' but part of a global diaspora, and that their presence was not just a challenge to Britain but created a new kind of Britishness that's internationally celebrated.\" His ideas threw a lifeline to young artists. Tawadros adds: \"At a time when art institutions were trying to bottle up what it meant to be black British or Asian British, when artists were frustrated at having to describe their work in terms of its 'Africanness' or 'Asianness', Stuart said that that experience, and its artistic expression, are more ambivalent; they draw on many things. He paved the way for the confidence of a new generation of artists, including Chris Ofili and Steve McQueen.\" Hall took an early interest in diasporic artists in London, such as Ronald Moody, Aubrey Williams and Francis Souza, who he says have been \"quietly written out of the record; not British enough for the Tate, not interna tional enough for Bankside\". But he found growing affinities, and collaborated, with a younger generation, including the film makers Isaac Julien, John Akomfrah and Martina Attille; the visual artists Keith Piper and Sonia Boyce; and the photographers Mark Sealy, David A Bailey, Sunil Gupta and Ingrid Pollard. \"In the 80s black artists became preoccupied with identity, self-portraits, putting their own body in the frame,\" says Hall. \"I was writing about identity and they were practising it. Racism is not just in the streets, it's written into how people recognise themselves. It made me more alert to the way artistic work is exploratory space in which ideas work themselves out. It brought me in touch with a huge creative explosion in literature, art, film.\" In an influential talk at London's ICA in 1989, Hall insisted \"blackness\", far from being fixed in nature, was \"politically and culturally constructed\" - partly through unconscious desire, fantasy and memory. The same went for \"whiteness\": \"We are all ethnically located.\" He was criticised for accepting the fracturing of a politically united black front. He says: \"There is a danger of locking into ethnic enclaves, but also the possibility of making common cause. I'm interested in a politics that makes links without ignoring difference.\" His stand is credited with freeing artists to speak from, but not for, black experiences, and giving crucial impetus to developing art criticism. Kobena Mercer, of New York University, says: \"Stuart said films weren't good just because black people made them. It contributed to a culture of debate, not just celebration.\" Hall is a voice cautioning against an \"easy, celebratory spirit\", warning instead of \"hard, perhaps iron times to come\". In his view, Britain is at a crossroads, marked by the 1998 Windrush celebrations and the pathologies exposed by the 1999 Macpherson report. What he calls multicultural drift - \"the explosion of cultural diversity and difference which is our lived daily reality\" - is no guarantee of peace or justice without the political will to see it through. \"Is Britain going to accept its diversity and become more humane? We don't yet know,\" he says. \"Yes, things are better in some ways, but a lot of people feel left out. The five boys in the Stephen Lawrence case didn't have an O-level between them. People like them are not in the dot.com revolution. The only time they feel English is when they can kick shit out of the Dutch or the Belgians. If you're serious about a multicultural society, you would address the sense of alienation of white working-class people, who have to be won to a new conception of themselves where Britain's not lording it from a gunboat.\" \"I don't think identity's fixed, the real, true self,\" he reflects. \"It's constructed from historical processes: I'm the sum of that boy called a 'coolie', the Rhodes scholar, the socialist from Jamaica. Every identity that feels so solid is the result of excluding things you could have been. I go back to Jamaica and adore it, but I couldn't be a Jamaican. I ache for a parallel life I could have lived. I also couldn't disappear into Englishness. I understand Britain; but I'm only British in a hyphenated way.\" Hall feels a sense of homecoming - but never a settled one. \"I never called myself black because no one in the Caribbean did then. I've come home to an identity I was never allowed to settle for; discovering I've become something I was all the time: a black intellectual, a migrant... People who are 68 should feel the ground solid under their feet. But I'm not surprised it feels shifting; it's the diasporic fate. More and more people feel life in this way.\"",

Why, when it's a cock. Throughout this extraordinary book, Ruth Padel suffers from a kind of metaphoric mania: nothing is allowed simply to be what it is. We are told many times that \"performing on guitar, the core act of rock, is whipping out your cock\". What Padel doesn't try to explain is why so many musicians beat themselves up trying to learn guitar in the first place, if they could just be whipping out their cocks to the same effect. </p> <p>Padel's avowed project is to examine how the sexuality and theatricality of rock music owes its structural roots to Greek myth. Unfortunately the case of such a link is never argued, merely gestured at. Either we are to take on faith the assumption that Greek myth \"underpins our own imagination\", or the claimed connection is so banal as to be meaningless. \"Like myth, [rock music] is amazingly transformative\"; \"Like Greek myth, pop song is about relationships\". The whole book is written in a spatchcocked, febrile prose, a nauseous fusion of the overheated and the blankly demotic. Music \"is brilliant at making things feel natural\", Padel chirrups; Greek tragedy is \"like a Lloyd-Webber musical\". </p> <p>Early on, Padel's claim that she is raiding the myth-kitty for its \"patterns of feeling\" alerts the reader to the fact that her approach is blissfully anachronistic: a Greek would have had no idea what \"patterns of feeling\" could possibly be, and would certainly have been baffled to be told that, for example, his society was \"mercilessly racist\". Padel's readings of the myths of Aphrodite, Narcissus, Eros, Hephaestus and so on (weirdly, she mostly prefers their Roman names) are filtered through a Vaseline-smeared lens of pseudo-Freudianism, the better to rope them in to her ready-made theories of sex'n'violence. </p> <p>Such panting Graecocentrism causes two major problems. The first is that Padel cannot acknowledge the wide variety of non-Greek influences on rock music. From the ludic occultism of late-1960s heavy rock to the Norse myth, medievalism and cod-Wagnerianism of prog rock and heavy metal (as parodied in Spinal Tap's wonderful \"druids\" spiel), popular music has enjoyed many more narrative forebears than those from ancient Athenian religion. Also absent is discussion of any popular-music tradition outside Anglo-American rock: the French tradition of chanson, for instance, typified by a rumpled, crooning Serge Gainsbourg. And if rock music really does grow out of Greek myth, it is perhaps surprising that the only pop star modern Greece has given to the world is Nana Mouskouri, a folky, bespectacled woman who, as far as I know, never once got her cock out on stage. </p> <p>Secondly, the attempt to force absolutely anything into one Greek template or another leads to gross simplifications. One of Padel's favourite explanatory myths is that of Hephaestus, the blacksmith, and Prometheus, the renegade Titan. Just as Prometheus stole a spark of fire from the blind god's forge, Padel trills, so the white man stole the creativity of black blues music in order to make rock'n'roll. </p> <p>It's a nice image, but it depends on a slew of lazy clich\u00e9s that Padel never attempts to unpack. When Padel cites \"black music\", it is uncertain whether she means jazz and blues specifically by African-Americans, or one of many thoroughly different traditions of the African continent: the musics of Zaire, Mali and so on. Yet she happily repeats the old musicological canards. One is that African Americans \"challenged western harmony\" by inventing the \"blue note\", yet such fractional intervals had already been around for centuries in northern European folk music. White rock musicians were apparently \"plundering the alien sophistication of Afro-American rhythm\", yet the meat-and-potatoes rock backbeat is worlds away from, say, the polyrhythms of folk music from western Sudan. </p> <p>Padel supplies a couple of well-researched chapters about racism in rock and its orientalist substructure, whereby the black man is patronised as the fount of sexual and musical creativity. When Muddy Waters sang \"I'm a man\", she notes perceptively, it was a political statement, in a context of southern racism, as well as a claim to sexual and musical prowess. But Padel's own approach is itself fundamentally orientalist. \"Soul music,\" she writes, \"could only have been black. Its voice is feeling, with the physicality as intense as possible: both coming from the sacredness endemic to black music and the community it expresses.\" </p> <p>This is a profoundly patronising sentence, implying that black musicians are mere automata of \"feeling\" and \"physicality\". They do it by instinct rather than design, don't you know? - which is exactly the sort of response that Padel herself deplores when she writes about white audiences thrilling to Duke Ellington's \"jungle\" jazz shows. And in what way might \"sacredness\" be more \"endemic\" to \"black music\" than it is, say, to Western polyphonic church music? </p> <p>The history of 20th-century popular music is a far more complex web of borrowings and creative thefts than Padel's Prometheus envy allows her to admit. Of course Jagger and Richard rewrote blues classics, while Paul Simon and David Byrne have shamelessly raided African musics, yet contemporary black hip-hop and garage, for example, would never have existed without the electronic template laid down by the white German band Kraftwerk: a fact that Padel acknowledges, but does not allow to spoil her argument. </p> <p>Padel's totemisation of \"black music\" also infects her discussion of misogyny in rock, in which she concentrates almost exclusively on smutty white heavy-metal bands. Yet if the adolescent yelps of dumb desire in the music of Led Zeppelin or Van Halen are to be decried as misogynistic, what does one say of the explicit narrations of sexual degradation and physical violence towards women that characterise gangsta rap, the stars of which are mostly black men? If you are Padel, you cling to the interesting but hardly extenuating circumstance that the audience for such music is mainly white. David Lee Roth, ex-frontman with Van Halen, is excoriated for consorting voraciously with female groupies, yet Jimi Hendrix, just as sexually insatiable, was merely displaying \"an innocently baroque gusto\". Innocently baroque? Best not go there. </p> <p> I'm a Man is a book about rock music that, in common with many less spurtily bizarre examples of its genre, has almost nothing to say about music. When Padel riffs on \"violence\" in rock (Eros and Mars, natch), she fails to distinguish precisely between actual violence that happens around music (Altamont), violent lyrical content, and some vague way in which the music itself might be enacting violence. But is heavy metal really more \"violent\" than, say, The Rite of Spring? Is rock music in general really more heavily laden with \"fierce ideology\" than the use of Wagner during the Third Reich, or Beethoven's soaring paean to the French Revolution? Padel doesn't address such questions, and she lacks the musical apparatus to notice that, for instance, 1980s heavy metal, with its gleeful tinsel of arpeggios and grandiose diminished-chord progressions, is just as indebted to baroque and early classical music as it is to African-American blues. </p> <p>Heavy metal, Padel thinks, sounds like \"menacing metallic destruction, evoking machine-like killing\". Actually, I'd suggest quite the opposite. Heavy or \"nu\" metal, a mainly working-class genre today, is often - as with the epically amplified protest group Rage Against the Machine, the true heirs of Dylan - a radical appropriation of machinic noise with which its musicians forge something lithe, rebellious and passionately humanist, something overtly political to which its alienated fans can cleave. Such artists really might be said to be the sons of Prometheus. Sadly, Padel's book is so cock-obsessed that she cannot see beyond her favoured image of men playing only with themselves.</p>",

Turbulent Priests, the third, sees the heavy-drinking journo with a line in corny jokes sent to Wraithlin Island on an assignment for the Primate of all Ireland. The Catholic Church fears that the islanders are being led into heresy by their priest, and when Starkey, his wife and the baby get ashore they discover that the congregation believes that the daughter of God is among them -and, more worryingly, they have closed down Wraithlin's only pub.

Knight, the Sunday-supplement columnist who has made a virtue out of plundering her life for material - and has pulled it off largely through a conspiratorial wit that suggests she's perfectly aware that it's trivial froth - has come up with that rare thing: the lightweight comic novel that is well-written, neatly constructed and actually funny. </p> <p>Clara Hutt, Knight's alter/altar ego, is 33, the mother of two sweet but annoying little boys, the daughter of an overbearing drama queen and the step-sibling of a collection of immaculately groomed freaks.

But the more she determines to count her blessings, casting her eyes over her neurotic single friends, the more she wonders about a world without headlice, PlayStations or school runs. Things, we sense, are coming to a head. </p> <p>Grass-is-greener girlpower novels are where it's at these days in terms of publishers' advances and blanket media coverage. Most of them are illiterate, poorly imagined drivel, exploiting their readers' insecurities with an easy self-pity, a smattering of designer labels and a low-grade, cynical complicity. Many are by journalists, who ought to know how to string a few sentences together. Knight's book, on the other hand, is exemplary middle-brow fiction.

When Marcel kisses Albertine in A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, it takes 15 pages and about an hour's reading before he finally makes his moue. Even then he can't resist collapsing into Proustian digression: \"To begin with, as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had tempted it to kiss, my eyes, in changing position saw a different pair of cheeks; the throat, studied at closer range as though through a magnifying glass, showed a coarser grain and a robustness which modified the character of the face.\" </p> <p>A few lines later - during which the irresolute reader will be shouting \"Kiss her! Just kiss her, damn you!\" - the object of his affection changes again: \"Just as at Balbec Albertine had often appeared different to me, so now . . . during this brief passage of my lips toward her cheek, it was ten Albertines that I saw; she was like a goddess with several heads, and whenever I sought to approach one of them, it was replaced by another.\" Finally, he closes in: \"next, my nose, crushed by the collision, no longer perceived any fragrance, and, without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire, I learned from these unpleasant signs, that at last I was in the act of kissing Albertine's cheek.\" It's as though Frasier's fey Niles Crane is ineptly kissing baffled Daphne. </p> <p>But, as Roger Shattuck writes in his wonderful new study of Proust's great novel, beyond the comedy of this passage, beyond the self-conscious self-parody of Proustian deferral, something more serious is afoot. There is an infirmity in Marcel's nature to which the best are prone. \"The most reflective of us are endowed with this antithesis of the Midas touch,\" writes Shattuck. \"It turns the things we want, or want to know, into dross.\" </p> <p>Proust knew this as well as anybody, and wrote about it better than anyone else. Elsewhere in the novel, Swann's obsession with Odette results in a lustreless marriage, for \"in physical possession . . . the possessor possesses nothing\". In A la Recherche, Proust could not envisage love as anything but such possession, an object upon which his characters are nonetheless self-defeatingly bent. </p> <p>Admittedly, this is hardly new territory for French literature. Montaigne felt oppressed by une erreur d'me: \"I attach too little value to things I possess, just because I possess them; and overvalue anything strange, absent, and not mine.\" This \"soul error\" was also used by Stendhal to account for a man's sexual failings: sexual possession causes the libido to wane. And such was the unbearable truth of soul error for Rousseau that he suggested the only world worth living in was the realm of fiction. </p> <p>Both Proust and Shattuck, his cunning celebrant, seem undecided as to whether soul error is the curse of the imaginative or a condition of being human. The latter is surely a more interesting position, since it suggests that the otherness of people is insurmountable. Proust was perhaps overwhelmed by his own experiences and nature into constructing a desperately unconsoling psychological law: \"Man is the being who cannot get out of himself, who knows others only in himself, and, if he denies it, lies.\" Shattuck, too, is no slouch at building putative psychological laws, such as his \"paradox of consciousness\": \"It is impossible to be present at the coronation of one's own happiness.\" </p> <p>Turning to William Carter's new biography, I found this: \"[Proust] apparently never had a sexually fulfilling relationship with a companion whom he loved. If he did, there are no traces of it in his letters and writings.\" Carter, professor of French at the University of Alabama, is in a perfect position to find such traces: this scrupulously detailed life betrays a great deal of time spent nose-deep in archives. </p> <p>A page earlier, we are given the only insight into Proust's sexual fulfilment. A young man would go to a room in a brothel where Proust would be under the covers with a sheet drawn up to his chin. He was required to undress and \"satisfy himself\" while Proust attempted the same. If Proust failed, two cages would be brought in, each containing a famished rat. The rats would be released and attack each other with piercing squeaks. This spectacle, we are told, enabled him to achieve orgasm. This is the only point in his nearly 1,000-page biography at which Carter pushes the reader's head into Proust's dirty linen; for the rest of the book we are in the Olympian heights of creative growth, with Proust cast as dedicated literary hero. </p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Gide saw in Proust's rodent-induced climaxes a \"psychological inadequacy\" and linked them to the depictions of gay men in A la Recherche that he found so objectionable. Gide contended that Proust contributed to the confusion between the homosexual and the invert. The former had noble associations dating from the ancient Greeks; the latter (as personified in A la Recherche by the Baron de Charlus) was a modern, decadent variety by means of which a man would become a woman for another man. </p> <p>Edmund White's more approachable (not just because briefer) queer reconstruction of the life of Proust, published last year, portrayed the writer as more or less openly gay, and, more happily yet, having several lovers during his life. Jean-Yves Tadi\u00e9, perhaps the world's greatest authority on Proust, whose magisterial biography of the writer has just been published, doubts this: \"Not a single love letter has been unearthed.\" What drives both Carter and Tadi\u00e9 is Proust's life as it helps us understand the evolution of the artist. In this, both are writing biography in the way recommended by their subject: \"Everything in an artist's life is connected according to the implacable logic of inner evolutions.\" But while Carter's book is ponderous, Tadi\u00e9's is a thrilling journey through the development of intellect and sensibility. It is his biography that at last eclipses George Painter's two-volume life, for more than 40 years the last word on its subject. Unlike Painter, Tadi\u00e9 does not draw on the novel to explain the life, but realises that the life of an artist is important only insofar as it helps us understand the work. He implicitly accepts Shattuck's advice: \"Forget the cork-lined room and the dallying aesthete. Proust lived in the world and wrote about it with fervour.\" </p> <p>The newly thriving Proust industry is an extraordinary thing. Popular books in recent years have included How Proust Can Change Your Life, The Year of Reading Proust and four volumes of selected letters, as well as such fine works as Malcolm Bowie's Proust Among the Stars and White's biography. There's even a poem by Craig Raine called A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. But all this is as nothing compared with the French wing of the operation. The real Proust industry is commanded by Tadi\u00e9 (professor of French at the Sorbonne), who has also edited the vast Pl\u00e9iade edition that includes sketches, drafts and variants in tiny print. For those intimidated by fat Proust, this is even more forbidding: now you can read a Pl\u00e9iade Proust that is eight inches thick rather than the earlier three. </p> <p>Shattuck lambasts Tadi\u00e9 for this edition. Unlike Montaigne, he argues, Proust worked towards a final version and that must form the basis of the authoritative edition. He has no truck with those French critics who maintain \"Le texte n'existe pas\" and who, he claims, have seduced Tadi\u00e9 into their sick world. The poor reader, though for more practical reasons, must surely agree: 7,500 pages of Proust is too much of a good thing. </p> <p>But Shattuck, a retired former lecturer at Harvard and Boston universities who has spent 30 years teaching and writing on Proust, may have unwittingly contributed to this industry. One of the appendices to his book is an analysis of the first sentence of A la Recherche, \"Longtemps, je me suis couch\u00e9 de bonne heure.\" Why did Proust use this tense, he wonders? Why not the characteristic imperfect tense that gives the novel its pervading tone of sadness and illusion? Interesting questions. But why stop one's exegesis there? After all, the second sentence is pretty fascinating. And the third - well, it's clearly worth a PhD of its own. The fourth, too . . . It is, to be sure, a terrible thing to be imaginative.</p>",

When Marcel kisses Albertine in A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, it takes 15 pages and about an hour's reading before he finally makes his moue. Even then he can't resist collapsing into Proustian digression: \"To begin with, as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had tempted it to kiss, my eyes, in changing position saw a different pair of cheeks; the throat, studied at closer range as though through a magnifying glass, showed a coarser grain and a robustness which modified the character of the face.\" A few lines later - during which the irresolute reader will be shouting \"Kiss her! Just kiss her, damn you!\" - the object of his affection changes again: \"Just as at Balbec Albertine had often appeared different to me, so now . . . during this brief passage of my lips toward her cheek, it was ten Albertines that I saw; she was like a goddess with several heads, and whenever I sought to approach one of them, it was replaced by another.\" Finally, he closes in: \"next, my nose, crushed by the collision, no longer perceived any fragrance, and, without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire, I learned from these unpleasant signs, that at last I was in the act of kissing Albertine's cheek.\" It's as though Frasier's fey Niles Crane is ineptly kissing baffled Daphne. But, as Roger Shattuck writes in his wonderful new study of Proust's great novel, beyond the comedy of this passage, beyond the self-conscious self-parody of Proustian deferral, something more serious is afoot. There is an infirmity in Marcel's nature to which the best are prone. \"The most reflective of us are endowed with this antithesis of the Midas touch,\" writes Shattuck. \"It turns the things we want, or want to know, into dross.\" Proust knew this as well as anybody, and wrote about it better than anyone else. Elsewhere in the novel, Swann's obsession with Odette results in a lustreless marriage, for \"in physical possession . . . the possessor possesses nothing\". In A la Recherche, Proust could not envisage love as anything but such possession, an object upon which his characters are nonetheless self-defeatingly bent. Admittedly, this is hardly new territory for French literature. Montaigne felt oppressed by une erreur d'me: \"I attach too little value to things I possess, just because I possess them; and overvalue anything strange, absent, and not mine.\" This \"soul error\" was also used by Stendhal to account for a man's sexual failings: sexual possession causes the libido to wane. And such was the unbearable truth of soul error for Rousseau that he suggested the only world worth living in was the realm of fiction. Both Proust and Shattuck, his cunning celebrant, seem undecided as to whether soul error is the curse of the imaginative or a condition of being human. The latter is surely a more interesting position, since it suggests that the otherness of people is insurmountable. Proust was perhaps overwhelmed by his own experiences and nature into constructing a desperately unconsoling psychological law: \"Man is the being who cannot get out of himself, who knows others only in himself, and, if he denies it, lies.\" Shattuck, too, is no slouch at building putative psychological laws, such as his \"paradox of consciousness\": \"It is impossible to be present at the coronation of one's own happiness.\" Turning to William Carter's new biography, I found this: \"[Proust] apparently never had a sexually fulfilling relationship with a companion whom he loved. If he did, there are no traces of it in his letters and writings.\" Carter, professor of French at the University of Alabama, is in a perfect position to find such traces: this scrupulously detailed life betrays a great deal of time spent nose-deep in archives. A page earlier, we are given the only insight into Proust's sexual fulfilment. A young man would go to a room in a brothel where Proust would be under the covers with a sheet drawn up to his chin. He was required to undress and \"satisfy himself\" while Proust attempted the same. If Proust failed, two cages would be brought in, each containing a famished rat. The rats would be released and attack each other with piercing squeaks. This spectacle, we are told, enabled him to achieve orgasm. This is the only point in his nearly 1,000-page biography at which Carter pushes the reader's head into Proust's dirty linen; for the rest of the book we are in the Olympian heights of creative growth, with Proust cast as dedicated literary hero. Andr\u00e9 Gide saw in Proust's rodent-induced climaxes a \"psychological inadequacy\" and linked them to the depictions of gay men in A la Recherche that he found so objectionable. Gide contended that Proust contributed to the confusion between the homosexual and the invert. The former had noble associations dating from the ancient Greeks; the latter (as personified in A la Recherche by the Baron de Charlus) was a modern, decadent variety by means of which a man would become a woman for another man. Edmund White's more approachable (not just because briefer) queer reconstruction of the life of Proust, published last year, portrayed the writer as more or less openly gay, and, more happily yet, having several lovers during his life. Jean-Yves Tadi\u00e9, perhaps the world's greatest authority on Proust, whose magisterial biography of the writer has just been published, doubts this: \"Not a single love letter has been unearthed.\" What drives both Carter and Tadi\u00e9 is Proust's life as it helps us understand the evolution of the artist. In this, both are writing biography in the way recommended by their subject: \"Everything in an artist's life is connected according to the implacable logic of inner evolutions.\" But while Carter's book is ponderous, Tadi\u00e9's is a thrilling journey through the development of intellect and sensibility. It is his biography that at last eclipses George Painter's two-volume life, for more than 40 years the last word on its subject. Unlike Painter, Tadi\u00e9 does not draw on the novel to explain the life, but realises that the life of an artist is important only insofar as it helps us understand the work. He implicitly accepts Shattuck's advice: \"Forget the cork-lined room and the dallying aesthete. Proust lived in the world and wrote about it with fervour.\" The newly thriving Proust industry is an extraordinary thing. Popular books in recent years have included How Proust Can Change Your Life, The Year of Reading Proust and four volumes of selected letters, as well as such fine works as Malcolm Bowie's Proust Among the Stars and White's biography. There's even a poem by Craig Raine called A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. But all this is as nothing compared with the French wing of the operation. The real Proust industry is commanded by Tadi\u00e9 (professor of French at the Sorbonne), who has also edited the vast Pl\u00e9iade edition that includes sketches, drafts and variants in tiny print. For those intimidated by fat Proust, this is even more forbidding: now you can read a Pl\u00e9iade Proust that is eight inches thick rather than the earlier three. Shattuck lambasts Tadi\u00e9 for this edition. Unlike Montaigne, he argues, Proust worked towards a final version and that must form the basis of the authoritative edition. He has no truck with those French critics who maintain \"Le texte n'existe pas\" and who, he claims, have seduced Tadi\u00e9 into their sick world. The poor reader, though for more practical reasons, must surely agree: 7,500 pages of Proust is too much of a good thing. But Shattuck, a retired former lecturer at Harvard and Boston universities who has spent 30 years teaching and writing on Proust, may have unwittingly contributed to this industry. One of the appendices to his book is an analysis of the first sentence of A la Recherche, \"Longtemps, je me suis couch\u00e9 de bonne heure.\" Why did Proust use this tense, he wonders? Why not the characteristic imperfect tense that gives the novel its pervading tone of sadness and illusion? Interesting questions. But why stop one's exegesis there? After all, the second sentence is pretty fascinating. And the third - well, it's clearly worth a PhD of its own. The fourth, too . . . It is, to be sure, a terrible thing to be imaginative.",

The short and robust answer is \"certainly not\", and however much we may revere, say, Richard Ellmann's great biography of James Joyce, we have to recognise that it does not break the boundaries of that genre to become the equivalent of an important novel. Richard Holmes thinks differently about his profession - thinks, in fact, is too strong a word; he believes differently and, in his latest gathering of superficial, self-regarding essays in biography, he attempts to charm his way into what he fondly regards as the Palace of Art. </p> <p>Here is his Jamesian beginning: \"We were at a cafe table, under the plane trees, far in the south, with the evening light flowing away down the river. I was asking the beloved novelist that old, fascinating question: how do you find your stories? Where do your ideas come from? When she said, with that sudden challenging smile of hers: 'But how do you find your subjects; where do they come from?' And I answered almost without thinking, between two mouthfuls of the cold white wine: 'Down many sidetracks.' She laughed and looked into the gathering dark. 'I think you'd better explain that,' she said. So I have tried.\" </p> <p>This is a slack version of the Jamesian donn\u00e9e, and is really an example of middle-class comfort journalism - travel, white wine, cultural backdrop, all ideas safely inert. And there's something gauche and clunking in that phrase \"the cold white wine\" - the unnecessary definite article gives it the displaced air of translationese. Though, on the other hand, it might be an example of a style Holmes elsewhere terms \"profoundly and timelessly Irish\". </p> <p>Holmes likes to be seen in France, especially in Paris, city of carefree or decadent artists, which figures largely in Sidetracks. He even has the gall to admire the \"white cupolas\" of that obscene building the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur, and when he remarks that Fouquet's is \"one of the ultra chique old cafes in Paris\" he mistakes \"chique\" - a plug of tobacco - for \"chic\". Or perhaps he's thinking of \"chiqu\u00e9\", meaning \"sham\"? Somehow elegance always deserts him as he allows us access to what he terms his \"personal casebook\". Here he asserts that Chatterton didn't commit suicide, but died from an accidental overdose of the arsenic with which he was treating his venereal disease. There is nothing to be gained from abandoning the legend of the poet whom Wordsworth called \"the marvellous boy\"; it merely diminishes Chatterton, whose account of thunder's \"rattling clymmynge sound\" Holmes in compensation absurdly over-praises as \"one of the finest pieces of onomatopoeic poetry in the whole of English verse\". </p> <p>In \"Monsieur Nadar\", a self- referential study of the biographer as photographer, we're somewhere between a sloppy horror story and a bad film: \"As night fell, and the street lamps swaying from their iron gibbets filled the thoroughfare with a garish, orange gaslight, and the cab lamps jerked down the uncertain asphalting of the boulevard, a great arc of clear white light, the output of 50 Bunsen Static Batteries linked in series, flooded down from the windows of number 35.\" </p> <p>As well as offering this type of kitschy moment, Holmes's style manages to be chirpy, pushy, heartless and romantically self-involved. It's like watching a dogged, plodding narcissist who relishes telling us that Eton is the \"sister college\" to King's College, Cambridge. Of the don and ghost writer MR James, he says that James presided at the end \"of the golden age of assured continuity between Eton and Cambridge\". And he concludes with this finely judged heritage moment: \"For myself, I shall call to mind only the view from the College Library, as the dark finally settles into the courts and the sound of Evensong drifts on the chill airs in the sweet, harmonious voices of the King's choristers and here and there a scholar twitches his curtains, sports his oak, and draws up his chair to the pool of light beneath his solitary, gazing lamp.\" The emphasis is on a vanished social harmony, the evocation of which will please the Times readers for whom most of these cooing pieces were designed. </p> <p>Even so, when in \"Poor Pierrot\" Holmes turns to the tortured comic genius of mime artist Jean-Gaspard Deburau, he evokes his White Faced Fool or enfarin\u00e9 with an intelligent sympathy that made me realise the link with Chaplin, though he doesn't point to it. However, he fails to offer any detailed analysis of the trial that followed the killing of a young apprentice, Nicholas Vielin, whom Deburau struck with a walking stick after he had insulted his wife. </p> <p>The fact that Deburau was holding his walking stick by the middle Holmes describes as \"crucial evidence\" which was \"not pursued\", but why it was crucial he fails to state (the blow would have been heavier if he'd held the stick by the handle). Time and again, Holmes fails to quote - he remarks that the Lisle letters written in the reign of Henry VIII \"show the living language that Shakespeare was heir to\", but manages only one quotation from them. Piling on more clich\u00e9s, he declares that Voltaire soared to \"increasingly dizzy heights in France\" and notes his \"brilliance as a private investor\", but fails to give any details of his dealings on the stock market. </p> <p>As he tries to make us rank him with biographers such as Ellmann and George Painter, Holmes's Pooterish self-regard can be felt in every hollow, preening sentence: \"One enters these great biographies, as into entire worlds of historical recreation, having the human density of large novels peopled by many characters, and yet focused upon the single, minutely documented experience of an actual life. They contain extraordinary richness and conviction; they shimmer with innumerable points of living light.\" </p> <p>That worn poeticism \"innumerable points of living light\" is typical of Holmes's tweeness. He even has the temerity to include two examples of that unprintable genre, the radio play. Holmes is a waffler who begins one paragraph \"Writing as an experimental biographer myself\". That use of \"myself\" is redundant, otiose, self-promoting and entirely vulgar. If you want to be soothed by complacent, low-level chattiness, read Sidetracks.</p>",

A bad-boy, coke-fuelled Toronto lawyer is sent up-country to defend a teacher accused of murdering the two lost girls of the title. Sentence by sentence there's little to fault: the moody unease of small-town Canada is maintained and a creeping horror revealed via a local skeleton lurking in the troubled lawyer's cupboard.

However, the latest artist for the newest wife is a fight-back ex-vet; give over. Morrell wrote the memorable post-Vietnam manhunt/survival thriller First Blood, but here the prose is stuck on autopilot: \"Sienna struck him as being more beautiful than ever. How do I hide one of the most striking women in the world? he thought.\" Fatal Climate David Hood Gollancz, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL Twenty years ago this book would have been a routine cold-war thriller. Now it's all Alvin Toffler with a plot, and the doomsday scenario has shifted from the nuclear to the climatic as a dull hero battles a White House cover-up regarding a likely catastrophe in the bottom half of the globe. Big storm climax, too much nick-of-time stuff and an over-egged eco-message. Lost Girls Andrew Pyper Macmillan, \u00a312 Buy it at BOL This first novel was a number-one seller in Canada and has been compared to Stephen King. Pyper does lots well, but he lacks King's narrative drive, opting instead for a fussy over-simplicity that leaves one unpersuaded by the story's supernatural element. A bad-boy, coke-fuelled Toronto lawyer is sent up-country to defend a teacher accused of murdering the two lost girls of the title. Sentence by sentence there's little to fault: the moody unease of small-town Canada is maintained and a creeping horror revealed via a local skeleton lurking in the troubled lawyer's cupboard. In the end, however, the glancing, semi-hokey plot belongs more in a short story than a novel. Painkillers Simon Ings Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL Again, this novel suffers some of the same problems. Smart writing and the laconic insolence of early Deighton take precedence over a plot that's more interesting at the edges than the centre, dominated by a mysterious Bakelite box and a grail of bizarre sexual perversions and strange cures. Painkillers is more enamoured of its own supercharged decadence than narrative application; it works best as journalism on, among other things, Hong Kong corruption, money laundering, autism, sandwich bars and London's South Bank, with a lot of names dropped along the way.",

      "body": "<p>I've just been mobbed in the playground, buried in a froth of 10-year-old girls. I'd barely whispered that I was going to see JK Rowling, and that was enough. Can you get me her autograph? Will you find out the name of the new book? Ask her who dies? Who gets to snog Harry? </p> <p>No one asks what the JK stands for, how old she is, whether she's married, got children. They know - Joanne Kathleen, 34, married, separated, single mum, six-year-old daughter Jessica, Jessie to us. </p> <p>I walk away shellshocked. One of the dads rushes after me. \"You're very lucky,\" he says. \"She doesn't often give interviews, a bit of a recluse. It all got to her, I hear, went a bit Harry potty.\" </p> <p>The grown-ups are almost as excitable as the children. A friend tells me that the books are really adult fare masquerading as kiddy lit. Look out for the leitmotif, he says - estrangement and loss. His wife calls him in for tea, and says he has always had a thing about boarding schools. </p> <p>Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997. There were news stories about it at the time because Rowling had received an advance of more than $100,000 in the US. The first three in the series of seven have now sold more than 35 million copies. The fourth book has achieved advanced sales of two million. Last year, Rowling earned \u00a314.5 million, making her Britain's third-best-paid woman, well ahead of the Spice Girls. And so the figures and hyperbole roll on. </p> <p>We've arranged to meet in a hotel in Edinburgh. She doesn't allow journalists into her house; her daughter has always been kept away from the press. The hotel is camouflaged as a town house. No name on the outside, just a number. It's musty and forbidding, and reminds me of the invisible entry to Platform 9 3/4, from where Harry and his fellow student wizards take the train to the magic school of Hogwarts. The Harry Potter books are well-crafted slices of nostalgia. Nostalgia for a world that few contemporary children would know about. Boarding school, house points, a girlie swot, an insipid hero, a slightly naughty best friend: this could be the Famous Five or Billy Bunter or Just William. Her publicist leads me to the JK Rowling suite. She is sitting there ablaze - all strawberry-blonde hair, red velvet jacket and cigarette smoke. She'd make an attractive, down-to-earth witch in this grandiose setting. </p> <p> She used to teach French in a Scottish comprehensive. She says that what attracted her to planet Potter was its \"controlled anarchy\", and she takes me back to her classroom experience. She doesn't think she was a bad teacher, but she does think she had bad thoughts. Sometimes, she'd face the children so aware of their strength and her vulnerability. \"I remember standing in front of the most difficult class I taught, and things were going fine. I don't know why - maybe it's my personality - but I was standing, leaning against the desk, waiting for the next person to say, 'What am I supposed to do?' and I thought, 'They can have me. What's this invisible thing stopping them?' \" </p> <p>They used to take the mickey out of her, mock her English accent. But they were never sure whether to do her as a cockney or a Hooray Henry, so she taught them how to do Forest-of-Dean. </p> <p>I tell her how, at my school, we drove our French teacher to a breakdown by sticking pins on her chair. She laughs, loudly, and I begin to feel guilty 25 years too late. \"That's nice of you- hahaha!\" She laughs like a Gatling gun - it's the loudest laugh I've ever heard. Suddenly it stops and she's speaking in a hush. \"Did she cry in class?\" I nod. \"See, that's bad. I never cried, I felt like it, but I never did.\" Rowling is one of life's copers. </p> <p>Her heroine is the writer Jessica Mitford. She remembers going to visit her great aunt Ivy in Somerset when she was 14, and being told about this amazing woman. \"And she said, 'You know what she did, Jo, she bought a camera on her father's account and then went travelling.'\" Young Joanne thought that was wonderful. Later, she discovered that Mitford was also a civil-rights activist who had suffered more than her share of tragedy. \"She had a total lack of self-pity. And she lost three children through war, which is the worst thing that could happen.\" </p> <p>After university, Rowling worked for the human-rights organisation Amnesty International. She still knew she wanted to write, but this was the next best option - \"a day job that I cared about\". She chews heavily on a cigarette before telling me how she loused up her life. Like Mitford, she left England to travel. She ended up teaching English as a foreign language in Portugal, where she fell in love with Jorge Arantes, married him, had a child, began writing Harry Potter, and fell out of love. When she told Jorge how she felt, he threw her out. She returned the next day with the police, collected Jessica, and headed back to Britain and the most dismal phase of her life. She had no money, no job, nowhere to live. \"Pretty much everything was gone.\" She also feared being dragged back to Portugal to fight a custody case. </p> <p>She considered moving to London, where many of her friends lived. But they were single, childless and carefree. London wasn't the right place for a woman with worries. So the girl, born in Chepstow, raised in the Forest of Dean, headed for Edinburgh, where her sister lived. \"I knew two or three people, and I was incredibly lonely. I was really angry.\" Did she resent having Jessica? \"No, never. I was very angry at myself.\" Why? \"I don't know. I never expected to find myself in that situation, and I was furious with myself. But I certainly never regretted leaving, and I never ever for a second regretted Jessica. She kept me going.\" </p> <p>It's not that she was particularly ambitious for herself, or that she had mapped out her life. \"I just never expected to mess up so badly that I would find myself in an unheated, mouse-infested flat, looking after my daughter. And I was angry because I felt I was letting her down.\" </p> <p> One day she visited her sister's friend and realised she'd hit rock bottom. \"She'd had a baby just a couple of months before me, and I saw Thomas's bedroom full of toys, and at that point, when I packed Jessica's toys away, they fitted into a shoe box, literally. I came home and cried my eyes out.\" But within six months, Rowling had found herself a typing job. She then took a postgraduate certificate in education. A year later, she was teaching French, and Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone had a publisher. Her first royalty check was for \u00a3600. Another year on, she was a millionaire and had given up teaching. It all sounds terribly neat, but of course it wasn't. </p> <p>When she left her teaching job, it was not because fame beckoned, it was because her contract had run out. \"The senior teacher in the department was very worried about me. I said I'd do supply teaching, and she said, 'Are you going to be all right?' And I said, 'Well, it's not all doom and gloom - I'm having a book published!' She said, 'No way! ' It wasn't that we both then thought this will set you up; it was just something you've done that's good.\" </p> <p>For years, Joanne Rowling was a closet writer. Her sister knew she was writing, her estranged husband knew, her oldest friend (to whom the second book is dedicated, and the template for Harry's friend Ron) knew. But that was about it. She once told another friend she was writing a novel, and the friend blanked her. \"I think she thought I was deluding myself, that I was in a nasty situation and had sat down one day and thought, I know, I'll write a novel . She probably thought it was a get-rich-quick scheme.\" </p> <p>For two hours every week, she'd leave Jessica with a friend and sneak off to a cafe to write. She has never had much time for fantasy, certainly isn't a buff. \"I've read The Hobbitt, and I read CS Lewis when I was about eight. But I don't like fantasy as a genre. Today, people seem to think if there's a unicorn in a book I will love it, and they give me the books...\" Invariably, they are wrong. She would much rather sit down with a good Roddy Doyle. She may have studied classics, but her frame of reference tends to be populist - Q Magazine, Father Ted, The Royle Family. What she seems to enjoy about Harry's universe is that it is her creation, ruled by her own logic. Whereas many of us may not have a clue whether Harry is exceeding his powers, she knows exactly what he can and can't do. She gets quite exercised if people tell her they think Harry's dead parents are going to come back to life at the end of book seven. \"We've had petrified people, and we've had what would have been fatal injuries, but once you're dead you're dead. No magic power can resurrect a truly dead person.\" </p> <p>One of her pupils eventually discovered she was writing a book. The girl had turned up without pen or paper; Rowling gave her the obligatory telling off and sent her to get some from the notepad on her desk. \"She was ages at the desk, and I turned round and said, 'Maggie will you come back and sit down,' and she went (putting on a Jean Brodie voice) 'Miss, are you a writer?'\" Rowling felt embarrassed, exposed. \"I think I said, 'No it's just a hobby.'\" </p> <p>Rowling is stridently unpretentious. She admits hers is a remarkable story, but not nearly as remarkable as the newspapers would have you believe. Always simplify, always exaggerate, she says - the golden rules. So the two-bedroom flat became a bedsit; the papers conveniently fail to mention that she was from a middle-class family, that she had a degree in French and classics. They much preferred to caricature her as the penniless single mother/divorcee.</p> <p>\"I detected a tone of 'Ah, lone parent', as if by definition, if you found yourself in that situation, you must be a real under-achiever, which is so the reverse of the case, because I know lone parents and, without exception, they are people doing paid work, and the work of two parents, and really working so damned hard.\" She says she needed more help, but her health visitor told her it wasn't available because she was coping too well. \"I know it's right that it would be kids at risk who get priority, but it does mean a lot of people, the majority, are in my situation where they are coping, but just a tiny bit of help would mean that life was so much better for the child.\" </p> <p>She asks if I remember the speech John Major made about society's ills being down to single mothers. She had just been back in Britain a couple of months, and now every time she hears Major described as a decent man she blanches. She says people exploit her story, depending on which way the political wind is blowing. \"There is the sense of 'Oooh, what a miracle!' as if it's superhuman for single parents to achieve anything. But then I've occasionally detected a 'Well, they can do it if they have to', which is equally unfair.\" She says she was able to succeed because all she needed was pen and paper, and then some way down the line a typewriter. If she'd wanted to be a fashioner designer or fine artist, she reckons she would have been stuffed. </p> <p>\"Penniless single mother,\" she repeats. \"The doleful tone of those words.\" At least, she says, when they call her a penniless divorcee it has attitude. \"The blowsy woman up at a bar, 'and then when Charlie left me...' \" Rowling's a cracking mimic. </p> <p>She enjoyed the second stage of success most. This was just before the release of the third book, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban. At this point, she was allowed to merge into the background as writers began to analyse the appeal of Potter. \"I never wanted the focus to be me. The vast majority of writers do not aspire to publicity. I'm sure there are a few... Jeffrey Archer, but then again he's not a writer, is he?\" Oooh! \"Oh come on, you know what I'm saying. There's a certain kind of fiction where publicity is crucial, but for the great majority of writers that's not what you're in it for, are you?\" </p> <p>It's a good question. Rowling may not be in it for the publicity, but her publisher, Bloomsbury, certainly is. The more the books have sold, the more the media has wanted of Rowling. And when she declined their interest, they decided she had become a recluse. A while ago, her ex sold his story. Rowling didn't react, though it obviously upset her. \"It is never a nice feeling.\" But he was nice about her, said how much he wanted her back and sod the money? \"Nice isn't really the word. Nice or horrible isn't the issue. It's just his version of our marriage,\" she says. Then there was the time that Raymond Briggs criticised the books, and the papers were banging on her door demanding a defence. Then she didn't win the Whitbread, and they were back for another comment. Now another controversy looms- Rowling has just failed to win the Carnegie prize for children's literature. </p> <p>\"Phase three has been, 'She's cracking up, she's become reclusive.' If I'd not given an interview for longer than a month, they wanted to know why.\" In many ways, Harry Potter has enabled her to take control of her life; but he has also brought intrusions. She says it's funny how strangers feel confident that they know exactly why she wrote the books. \"I'm often informed that I wrote the first book as escapism, because my life was so horrible. Well, that's just not true. When I started writing the books, I was working, in a very happy relationship, life was fine, no one had died. Everything was okay.\" </p> <p>I ask her what is the most extravagant thing she has done with all her millions. She says it came at a time when she was struggling with the plot to book four, just after Jorge's story of their marriage was published. She was sitting in her favourite writing cafe, had been there two hours, and the paper was blank with self-pity. \"I was just feeling very down, and really worried about the book, and then I thought there is an upside to this situation and I walked into this jeweller's and I dropped a lot of money on a very expensive ring that I'd seen the previous week. And you know when you spend more money than you plan to, everything else looks cheap by comparison - so then I bought presents for my two best female friends as well. And I have to say it helped.\" </p> <p>Where's the ring now? \"At home.\" What's it like? \"Obscene. But that was the point. It's a big square cut stone, aquamarine. You can't type with it on because it's so heavy. It's one of those things you have to bring out on certain occasions; it's not day-to-day because you could really hurt someone with it.\" Rowling considers the ring such an extravagance because there was no justification for it. She recently bought a nice home, but doesn't regard that as extravagant because it will make life more comfortable for Jessica. </p> <p>Rowling, Jessica and Harry. It makes for an intimate family. And when she talks about Harry, how anxious she was that a Hollywood studio didn't come along and ruin him, how he's reaching puberty and about to discover girls, she does sound like a doting mother. She says she is possessive of him. What's the worst thing anyone could do to him? She mishears me. \"I can do to him whatever I like. I'm allowed to torture him as much as I want. He's mine.\" </p> <p>Does Jessica get jealous of Harry? \"Oh no, she knows, and she's right, that she's top dog. She's got a healthy ego, in the best way.\" Initially, Rowling told Jessica she wouldn't read her the books until she was seven. But when she started school, the older kids would quiz her about Harry and she was in no position to answer. \"It happened so often that, in the end, words had to be dropped - would they please leave her alone so she could play with her friends.\" When Jessica began to go behind her mother's back, asking other people what happened in Harry Potter, she decided it was unfair to keep her away from the books any longer. \"I was more nervous reading to her than anybody.\" Why? \"What if she'd turned round and said this is rubbish, I want to go and play with everyone - hahahaha! I would have been okay with it, but it would have been difficult because if her tea was half-an-hour late, and I'm going, 'In a minute, in a minute, I've just got to finish this.' It's probably easier for her to take if she thinks she'll like the end-result.\" Just as she won't tell anyone else about the plot of the new book, she won't tell Jessica. A secret's a secret. </p> <p>Considering Rowling's own life, it seems surprising that Harry's world is so traditional, so removed from the biting realities of single parents and the dole. It's a very conservative world, I say. She takes a deep, uneasy breath. \"So I'm told repeatedly. The two groups of people who are constantly thanking me are wiccans (white witches) and boarding schools. And really, don't thank me. I'm not with either of them. New ageism leaves me completely cold, and Jessie would never go to boarding school. I went to a comprehensive.\" Did she ever want to be part of that world? No, she says, the first time she met anyone who'd been to boarding school was at university. \"I thought it sounded horrible. Not because I was so attached to home - I couldn't wait to leave home - just that the culture was not one I'd enjoy. It staggers me to meet people who want to send their kids away.\" </p> <p>She has become edgy. \"I do get kind of frustrated with this conservative world thing because...\" She explains at length, and somewhat defensively, that the school had to be a boarding school because most of the magic happens in the middle of the night, and if it was a day school you wouldn't get the same sense of community. She also argues that, in a way, Harry does reflect the modern world because he is mixed race - his dad being a wizard, his mum being a muggle (human) witch - which seems to be pushing it a bit. </p> <p>This is about the only claim Rowling does make for her Potter books. She never suggests they stand up as modern classics. She's a pragmatist: she knows bestsellers are rarely great literature. When I say they are well-written, she seems delighted and tells me how at times she rewrites obsessively. </p> <p>What limits the books for me is their lack of emotional and psychological depth. One of the few moving, and surprising, moments occurs in the first book, when Harry stares into a magic mirror... and sees his dead parents. He later learns that the mirror offers a reflection of what he most wants in life. Rowling says this is a rare autobiographical element in the novels. \"The mirror is almost painfully from my own feelings about my mother's death. She died when I was 25, so I was six months into writing the book when she died. And she was 45.\" She says if she were looking in the mirror she would see exactly what Harry saw. People search pointlessly for other aspects of her life in the books. As she says, they are works of imagination. </p> <p>At times when Rowling is talking about her success, she seems shaky, suspicious of it. Of course, she loves having money, she says, but maybe she wishes she'd been just a little less successful. She worries about the amount of money, and she also worries about talking about the fact that it worries her. \"Yes, I'm riddled with guilt. It's a very weird situation. Then again, there is a solution... you can give it away. You can't sit there and say, 'Ah, it's tragic, I've got a lot of money', because nobody's stopping you spreading it about a bit.\" And is she doing so? \"A bit,\" she says tersely. At least, she says, it doesn't feel like dirty money. </p> <p>I ask Rowling if something such as this can happen without it changing you. She takes an age to answer. You sense she'd love to say, no, of course it doesn't alter a thing, but it wouldn't be true. \"No, I don't think it is possible, honestly.\" She admits that it has become harder to trust the motives of people, and at the same time others are wary of her. She mentions a good friend she made in the schoolyard. The woman didn't know she'd written the Harry Potter books. \"She said to me if I'd known who you were I'd never have spoken to you. I said, 'Oh, cheers!' She then said, 'I would have thought that you would have thought that I only wanted to speak to you because...' I laughed. She was very funny about it. So when we met in a normal, bog-standard situation we became very friendly. It's perfectly possible...\" Suddenly, she seems a little self-conscious. \"You know there are a lot of people who don't know about Harry Potter, millions of people who don't have a clue. I'm not Mick Jagger!\" </p> <p>Rowling still insists that the seventh Harry Potter will be the last. Will she miss Harry? She says she's not looking forward to finishing, but there will be some comforts in it. Less demand for photographs, for one. \"If I can honestly say to myself that, at the end of book seven, I wrote the story that I set out to write, and didn't change one tiny thing because some reviewer had said, 'Let's have more feisty female footballers '; if I can look myself in the mirror and say I did it the way I wanted, then I'm okay with it.\" </p> <p>She would like to try her hand at adult fiction, and has a filing cabinet full of notes. \"Yes, I'll still write. But I really mean this, I think it's quite possible that I'll finish Harry and go to the filing cabinet where the notes are and think they're rubbish.\" </p> <p>I follow her downstairs to where she's having her picture taken. The photographer asks if she minds having a picture taken with a broom that he's bought.

      "bodyText": "I've just been mobbed in the playground, buried in a froth of 10-year-old girls. I'd barely whispered that I was going to see JK Rowling, and that was enough. Can you get me her autograph? Will you find out the name of the new book? Ask her who dies? Who gets to snog Harry? No one asks what the JK stands for, how old she is, whether she's married, got children. They know - Joanne Kathleen, 34, married, separated, single mum, six-year-old daughter Jessica, Jessie to us. I walk away shellshocked. One of the dads rushes after me. \"You're very lucky,\" he says. \"She doesn't often give interviews, a bit of a recluse. It all got to her, I hear, went a bit Harry potty.\" The grown-ups are almost as excitable as the children. A friend tells me that the books are really adult fare masquerading as kiddy lit. Look out for the leitmotif, he says - estrangement and loss. His wife calls him in for tea, and says he has always had a thing about boarding schools. Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997. There were news stories about it at the time because Rowling had received an advance of more than $100,000 in the US. The first three in the series of seven have now sold more than 35 million copies. The fourth book has achieved advanced sales of two million. Last year, Rowling earned \u00a314.5 million, making her Britain's third-best-paid woman, well ahead of the Spice Girls. And so the figures and hyperbole roll on. We've arranged to meet in a hotel in Edinburgh. She doesn't allow journalists into her house; her daughter has always been kept away from the press. The hotel is camouflaged as a town house. No name on the outside, just a number. It's musty and forbidding, and reminds me of the invisible entry to Platform 9 3/4, from where Harry and his fellow student wizards take the train to the magic school of Hogwarts. The Harry Potter books are well-crafted slices of nostalgia. Nostalgia for a world that few contemporary children would know about. Boarding school, house points, a girlie swot, an insipid hero, a slightly naughty best friend: this could be the Famous Five or Billy Bunter or Just William. Her publicist leads me to the JK Rowling suite. She is sitting there ablaze - all strawberry-blonde hair, red velvet jacket and cigarette smoke. She'd make an attractive, down-to-earth witch in this grandiose setting. She used to teach French in a Scottish comprehensive. She says that what attracted her to planet Potter was its \"controlled anarchy\", and she takes me back to her classroom experience. She doesn't think she was a bad teacher, but she does think she had bad thoughts. Sometimes, she'd face the children so aware of their strength and her vulnerability. \"I remember standing in front of the most difficult class I taught, and things were going fine. I don't know why - maybe it's my personality - but I was standing, leaning against the desk, waiting for the next person to say, 'What am I supposed to do?' and I thought, 'They can have me. What's this invisible thing stopping them?' \" They used to take the mickey out of her, mock her English accent. But they were never sure whether to do her as a cockney or a Hooray Henry, so she taught them how to do Forest-of-Dean. I tell her how, at my school, we drove our French teacher to a breakdown by sticking pins on her chair. She laughs, loudly, and I begin to feel guilty 25 years too late. \"That's nice of you- hahaha!\" She laughs like a Gatling gun - it's the loudest laugh I've ever heard. Suddenly it stops and she's speaking in a hush. \"Did she cry in class?\" I nod. \"See, that's bad. I never cried, I felt like it, but I never did.\" Rowling is one of life's copers. Her heroine is the writer Jessica Mitford. She remembers going to visit her great aunt Ivy in Somerset when she was 14, and being told about this amazing woman. \"And she said, 'You know what she did, Jo, she bought a camera on her father's account and then went travelling.'\" Young Joanne thought that was wonderful. Later, she discovered that Mitford was also a civil-rights activist who had suffered more than her share of tragedy. \"She had a total lack of self-pity. And she lost three children through war, which is the worst thing that could happen.\" After university, Rowling worked for the human-rights organisation Amnesty International. She still knew she wanted to write, but this was the next best option - \"a day job that I cared about\". She chews heavily on a cigarette before telling me how she loused up her life. Like Mitford, she left England to travel. She ended up teaching English as a foreign language in Portugal, where she fell in love with Jorge Arantes, married him, had a child, began writing Harry Potter, and fell out of love. When she told Jorge how she felt, he threw her out. She returned the next day with the police, collected Jessica, and headed back to Britain and the most dismal phase of her life. She had no money, no job, nowhere to live. \"Pretty much everything was gone.\" She also feared being dragged back to Portugal to fight a custody case. She considered moving to London, where many of her friends lived. But they were single, childless and carefree. London wasn't the right place for a woman with worries. So the girl, born in Chepstow, raised in the Forest of Dean, headed for Edinburgh, where her sister lived. \"I knew two or three people, and I was incredibly lonely. I was really angry.\" Did she resent having Jessica? \"No, never. I was very angry at myself.\" Why? \"I don't know. I never expected to find myself in that situation, and I was furious with myself. But I certainly never regretted leaving, and I never ever for a second regretted Jessica. She kept me going.\" It's not that she was particularly ambitious for herself, or that she had mapped out her life. \"I just never expected to mess up so badly that I would find myself in an unheated, mouse-infested flat, looking after my daughter. And I was angry because I felt I was letting her down.\" One day she visited her sister's friend and realised she'd hit rock bottom. \"She'd had a baby just a couple of months before me, and I saw Thomas's bedroom full of toys, and at that point, when I packed Jessica's toys away, they fitted into a shoe box, literally. I came home and cried my eyes out.\" But within six months, Rowling had found herself a typing job. She then took a postgraduate certificate in education. A year later, she was teaching French, and Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone had a publisher. Her first royalty check was for \u00a3600. Another year on, she was a millionaire and had given up teaching. It all sounds terribly neat, but of course it wasn't. When she left her teaching job, it was not because fame beckoned, it was because her contract had run out. \"The senior teacher in the department was very worried about me. I said I'd do supply teaching, and she said, 'Are you going to be all right?' And I said, 'Well, it's not all doom and gloom - I'm having a book published!' She said, 'No way! ' It wasn't that we both then thought this will set you up; it was just something you've done that's good.\" For years, Joanne Rowling was a closet writer. Her sister knew she was writing, her estranged husband knew, her oldest friend (to whom the second book is dedicated, and the template for Harry's friend Ron) knew. But that was about it. She once told another friend she was writing a novel, and the friend blanked her. \"I think she thought I was deluding myself, that I was in a nasty situation and had sat down one day and thought, I know, I'll write a novel . She probably thought it was a get-rich-quick scheme.\" For two hours every week, she'd leave Jessica with a friend and sneak off to a cafe to write. She has never had much time for fantasy, certainly isn't a buff. \"I've read The Hobbitt, and I read CS Lewis when I was about eight. But I don't like fantasy as a genre. Today, people seem to think if there's a unicorn in a book I will love it, and they give me the books...\" Invariably, they are wrong. She would much rather sit down with a good Roddy Doyle. She may have studied classics, but her frame of reference tends to be populist - Q Magazine, Father Ted, The Royle Family. What she seems to enjoy about Harry's universe is that it is her creation, ruled by her own logic. Whereas many of us may not have a clue whether Harry is exceeding his powers, she knows exactly what he can and can't do. She gets quite exercised if people tell her they think Harry's dead parents are going to come back to life at the end of book seven. \"We've had petrified people, and we've had what would have been fatal injuries, but once you're dead you're dead. No magic power can resurrect a truly dead person.\" One of her pupils eventually discovered she was writing a book. The girl had turned up without pen or paper; Rowling gave her the obligatory telling off and sent her to get some from the notepad on her desk. \"She was ages at the desk, and I turned round and said, 'Maggie will you come back and sit down,' and she went (putting on a Jean Brodie voice) 'Miss, are you a writer?'\" Rowling felt embarrassed, exposed. \"I think I said, 'No it's just a hobby.'\" Rowling is stridently unpretentious. She admits hers is a remarkable story, but not nearly as remarkable as the newspapers would have you believe. Always simplify, always exaggerate, she says - the golden rules. So the two-bedroom flat became a bedsit; the papers conveniently fail to mention that she was from a middle-class family, that she had a degree in French and classics. They much preferred to caricature her as the penniless single mother/divorcee. \"I detected a tone of 'Ah, lone parent', as if by definition, if you found yourself in that situation, you must be a real under-achiever, which is so the reverse of the case, because I know lone parents and, without exception, they are people doing paid work, and the work of two parents, and really working so damned hard.\" She says she needed more help, but her health visitor told her it wasn't available because she was coping too well. \"I know it's right that it would be kids at risk who get priority, but it does mean a lot of people, the majority, are in my situation where they are coping, but just a tiny bit of help would mean that life was so much better for the child.\" She asks if I remember the speech John Major made about society's ills being down to single mothers. She had just been back in Britain a couple of months, and now every time she hears Major described as a decent man she blanches. She says people exploit her story, depending on which way the political wind is blowing. \"There is the sense of 'Oooh, what a miracle!' as if it's superhuman for single parents to achieve anything. But then I've occasionally detected a 'Well, they can do it if they have to', which is equally unfair.\" She says she was able to succeed because all she needed was pen and paper, and then some way down the line a typewriter. If she'd wanted to be a fashioner designer or fine artist, she reckons she would have been stuffed. \"Penniless single mother,\" she repeats. \"The doleful tone of those words.\" At least, she says, when they call her a penniless divorcee it has attitude. \"The blowsy woman up at a bar, 'and then when Charlie left me...' \" Rowling's a cracking mimic. She enjoyed the second stage of success most. This was just before the release of the third book, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban. At this point, she was allowed to merge into the background as writers began to analyse the appeal of Potter. \"I never wanted the focus to be me. The vast majority of writers do not aspire to publicity. I'm sure there are a few... Jeffrey Archer, but then again he's not a writer, is he?\" Oooh! \"Oh come on, you know what I'm saying. There's a certain kind of fiction where publicity is crucial, but for the great majority of writers that's not what you're in it for, are you?\" It's a good question. Rowling may not be in it for the publicity, but her publisher, Bloomsbury, certainly is. The more the books have sold, the more the media has wanted of Rowling. And when she declined their interest, they decided she had become a recluse. A while ago, her ex sold his story. Rowling didn't react, though it obviously upset her. \"It is never a nice feeling.\" But he was nice about her, said how much he wanted her back and sod the money? \"Nice isn't really the word. Nice or horrible isn't the issue. It's just his version of our marriage,\" she says. Then there was the time that Raymond Briggs criticised the books, and the papers were banging on her door demanding a defence. Then she didn't win the Whitbread, and they were back for another comment. Now another controversy looms- Rowling has just failed to win the Carnegie prize for children's literature. \"Phase three has been, 'She's cracking up, she's become reclusive.' If I'd not given an interview for longer than a month, they wanted to know why.\" In many ways, Harry Potter has enabled her to take control of her life; but he has also brought intrusions. She says it's funny how strangers feel confident that they know exactly why she wrote the books. \"I'm often informed that I wrote the first book as escapism, because my life was so horrible. Well, that's just not true. When I started writing the books, I was working, in a very happy relationship, life was fine, no one had died. Everything was okay.\" I ask her what is the most extravagant thing she has done with all her millions. She says it came at a time when she was struggling with the plot to book four, just after Jorge's story of their marriage was published. She was sitting in her favourite writing cafe, had been there two hours, and the paper was blank with self-pity. \"I was just feeling very down, and really worried about the book, and then I thought there is an upside to this situation and I walked into this jeweller's and I dropped a lot of money on a very expensive ring that I'd seen the previous week. And you know when you spend more money than you plan to, everything else looks cheap by comparison - so then I bought presents for my two best female friends as well. And I have to say it helped.\" Where's the ring now? \"At home.\" What's it like? \"Obscene. But that was the point. It's a big square cut stone, aquamarine. You can't type with it on because it's so heavy. It's one of those things you have to bring out on certain occasions; it's not day-to-day because you could really hurt someone with it.\" Rowling considers the ring such an extravagance because there was no justification for it. She recently bought a nice home, but doesn't regard that as extravagant because it will make life more comfortable for Jessica. Rowling, Jessica and Harry. It makes for an intimate family. And when she talks about Harry, how anxious she was that a Hollywood studio didn't come along and ruin him, how he's reaching puberty and about to discover girls, she does sound like a doting mother. She says she is possessive of him. What's the worst thing anyone could do to him? She mishears me. \"I can do to him whatever I like. I'm allowed to torture him as much as I want. He's mine.\" Does Jessica get jealous of Harry? \"Oh no, she knows, and she's right, that she's top dog. She's got a healthy ego, in the best way.\" Initially, Rowling told Jessica she wouldn't read her the books until she was seven. But when she started school, the older kids would quiz her about Harry and she was in no position to answer. \"It happened so often that, in the end, words had to be dropped - would they please leave her alone so she could play with her friends.\" When Jessica began to go behind her mother's back, asking other people what happened in Harry Potter, she decided it was unfair to keep her away from the books any longer. \"I was more nervous reading to her than anybody.\" Why? \"What if she'd turned round and said this is rubbish, I want to go and play with everyone - hahahaha! I would have been okay with it, but it would have been difficult because if her tea was half-an-hour late, and I'm going, 'In a minute, in a minute, I've just got to finish this.' It's probably easier for her to take if she thinks she'll like the end-result.\" Just as she won't tell anyone else about the plot of the new book, she won't tell Jessica. A secret's a secret. Considering Rowling's own life, it seems surprising that Harry's world is so traditional, so removed from the biting realities of single parents and the dole. It's a very conservative world, I say. She takes a deep, uneasy breath. \"So I'm told repeatedly. The two groups of people who are constantly thanking me are wiccans (white witches) and boarding schools. And really, don't thank me. I'm not with either of them. New ageism leaves me completely cold, and Jessie would never go to boarding school. I went to a comprehensive.\" Did she ever want to be part of that world? No, she says, the first time she met anyone who'd been to boarding school was at university. \"I thought it sounded horrible. Not because I was so attached to home - I couldn't wait to leave home - just that the culture was not one I'd enjoy. It staggers me to meet people who want to send their kids away.\" She has become edgy. \"I do get kind of frustrated with this conservative world thing because...\" She explains at length, and somewhat defensively, that the school had to be a boarding school because most of the magic happens in the middle of the night, and if it was a day school you wouldn't get the same sense of community. She also argues that, in a way, Harry does reflect the modern world because he is mixed race - his dad being a wizard, his mum being a muggle (human) witch - which seems to be pushing it a bit.

Ben Elton, Sean Hughes et al may dream of rivalling Jeffrey Archer or the late Dame Babs, but they also seem to share those authors' approach to quality control. Someone - it won't be their agents or publishers - ought to tell them that even comic novels need decent plots and halfway credible characters, and that to write a serious book you also need something to say. </p> <p>In a perfect world, those who have helped make British TV comedy what it is (almost unmitigated rubbish) would be banned from flytipping in the layby of literature. Failing that, their work would carry big red warning stickers, and bookshop staff would hand out extra-long bargepoles with which not to touch the product. There would be a few innocent casualties, such as Robert Newman, whose novel about a policeman, Manners , was almost enough to redeem the whole genre.

Which brings us to Night of the Toxic Ostrich , a comic novel by Nick Revell, a former stand-up who has written for Drop the Dead Donkey and a number of radio shows. This book is a lot better than most of its rivals. But that's not saying much. </p> <p> Ostrich revolves around an obnoxious London-based comedian called James, straight but pretending to be gay for the sake of his career, who rashly makes an on-air offer to bugger the Taliban, \"even though I don't normally go for blokes with beards\". A hitman travels from Afghanistan to take revenge, but instead falls in love with the woman the comedian is chasing. The comic and his would-be nemesis become entangled with a homicidal maniac with metal hands, a dangerously constipated fat man, a sleazebag promoter, the sweet but hippy-dippy love interest and James's mustachioed female agent, plus a radioactive ostrich with a bad attitude and a mastery of the martial arts, who ends up giving James the treatment he had proposed for the Taliban. </p> <p>Revell is the author of the well-received House of the Spirit Levels, and he has a better than average grasp of structure, skilfully juggling characters and advancing his convoluted plot. But it can't have taken him long to come up with James and the entertainment-biz scumbags who surround him. Revell comes across as an artisan rather than an artist, a would-be Tom Sharpe who can't quite take us beyond mild amusement. And he certainly can't match him when it comes to having fun with flightless birds: in his 1973 novel Indecent Exposure, Sharpe fed his ostriches explosives-filled condoms then used them to blow up bits of South Africa, which at the time was no more than it deserved. </p> <p>Fortunately, if you did get a money-back guarantee, the \u00a39.99 you paid for Ostrich will also cover Never Trust a Rabbit. This collection of short stories comes from Jeremy Dyson, the non-acting member of the League of Gentlemen comedy team. It's a rougher read - downright ropey in parts - yet much more satisfying. </p> <p>The title comes from a Hungarian proverb - \"Never trust a rabbit. They may look like a children's toy, but they eat your crops\" - and the book could be subtitled \"Tales of the Fairly Unexpected\". In \"Love in the Time of Molyneux\", the Messiah returns to earth, only to be betrayed by a \"friend\" who hates him for his perfection; in \"We Who Walk Through Walls\", a man recruited to help a phony magician in one of his tricks turns out to be a supernatural policeman sent to punish him for cheapening wonder. </p> <p>The tales' starting points are often well-worn - Dyson is hardly the first writer to find horror on the tube or enchantment at the bottom of the sea - but he normally manages to work in a satisfying twist. On the downside, he is often pompous: one character \"refrains from expressing the thought\". He can also be clunky: another \"appears relatively small in the flesh\". He's over-fond of paradoxes: \"Molyneux was not conventionally handsome but he was remarkably attractive.\" He speaks in too many voices, often not his own: some tales remind you of Roald Dahl, others of Ray Bradbury. And at times his training as a screenwriter makes itself felt in details that might help dress a set, but do nothing for the imagination. </p> <p>These aren't insuperable problems, but it's significant that they haven't been ironed out. Book editors are too often loath to get to grips with writers with a reputation in another field. (Ben Elton's first novel, Stark, is a case in point, although putting that right would have employed more people than his arch-enemy Thatcher put on the dole.) </p> <p>Yet for all Rabbit 's flaws, there's something admirable about it. It reflects a boldness that's rarely seen among Dyson's confreres - a willingness to dream and a refusal to fall back on humour when the ideas run thin. If the man gets some proper direction and resists complacency, he just might live up to his reputation. That's more than you can say for most of his peers.</p>",

Ben Elton, Sean Hughes et al may dream of rivalling Jeffrey Archer or the late Dame Babs, but they also seem to share those authors' approach to quality control. Someone - it won't be their agents or publishers - ought to tell them that even comic novels need decent plots and halfway credible characters, and that to write a serious book you also need something to say. In a perfect world, those who have helped make British TV comedy what it is (almost unmitigated rubbish) would be banned from flytipping in the layby of literature. Failing that, their work would carry big red warning stickers, and bookshop staff would hand out extra-long bargepoles with which not to touch the product. There would be a few innocent casualties, such as Robert Newman, whose novel about a policeman, Manners , was almost enough to redeem the whole genre. But at least readers would have some protection against the day when French and Saunders get it into their heads that what the world really needs is 850 pages of flatulence masquerading as a good read. In the meantime, you pays your money and you takes your choice, preferably in a shop with a cast-iron returns policy.

A middle-class woman said of this horrific incident \"There is no way it was sectarian\", and went on to talk darkly of \"other factors\" which may have been involved. Most of the community was in a state of denial about the murders, deluding themselves with a more-to-it-than-meets-the-eye explanation that has turned a scandalous rumour into fact.

Four police officers and a forensic specialist have received permission from Beijing to travel in the next fortnight to the Fujian region where the dead are believed to have come from. Kent police said yesterday they had provisional identities for 42 of the young victims. Only after taking mouth swabs from parents or next of kin and matching it to the DNA of the victims will a final identification be made. Days after the grim discovery in Dover docks last month, Chinese police officers arrived to assist Kent police in identifying the dead, who had tried to enter Britain illegally. Kent police confirmed yesterday that they had provided pictures of the dead to Chinese authorities, but said they had no knowledge of reports that these had been displayed on posters in villages in Fujian province. Kent officers were helped in the identifications by the only two survivors. Their lives are believed to be in danger from leaders of the smuggling ring, and they are being housed under police guard. Members of Britain's Chinese community said the insistence on checking the immigration status of anyone coming forward to identify the victims was scaring people off. In a letter to Wah-Piow Tan, a London based lawyer contacted by eight people who fear their relatives were among the dead, Kent police stated that anyone coming forward would have to have their immigration status checked. Mr Tan said many of those were themselves in Britain illegally, facing removal or seeking asylum, and feared deportation to China if they came forward. Mr Tan said: \"I believe the British authorities are not taking into account the characteristics of the Fujian community which are either underground or are living in fear of officialdom.\" Three people are facing charges in connection with the deaths. Perry Wacker, 32, of Rotterdam, is facing manslaughter and smuggling charges.

      "bodyText": "At one time they were Britain's most fashionable couple - splashed across the front of Vanity Fair under a union flag duvet - but now the ambassadors of 1990s Cool Britannia have split. The actor Patsy Kensit last night announced her separation from husband, Oasis singer Liam Gallagher, bringing to an end their fiery three-year marriage. As the band once heralded as the next Beatles watch their fortunes fade, Kensit - who was previously married to Jim Kerr, the lead singer of 1980s band of the moment Simple Minds - has finally decided the troubled relationship has run its course. She was yesterday seen loading items from the couple's \u00a31.25m home in St John's Wood, north London, which is thought to have been put up for sale. Gallagher, as famous for his rows as for his singing, has been through numerous temporary splits from Kensit. Last year she left home for a time and was reportedly in tears most days during filming of Janice Beard: 45 WPM. The couple also separated 17 months into their marriage when Gallagher allegedly threw his wife and her son by Kerr out of their home. Gallagher himself was then turfed out last November after he disappeared for two days. Kensit was also photographed kicking the door of her BMW after newspaper reports linked Gallagher to supermodel Kate Moss. There were hopes the couple would settle down when Kensit gave birth to Lennon - named after Gallagher's Beatle hero - in September 1999. But a spokesman for Kensit last night said the split was final. It is the third marriage breakdown for Kensit, who was also previously married to Dan Donovan of the band Big Audio Dynamite. The strain between Gallagher and Kensit came to light in May when Kensit reportedly checked into hospital suffering from depression and anxiety attacks. At the time she was said to be \"emotionally drained\" and, at times, too weak to leave the house. More recently she has been seen without her wedding ring. Earlier this year she pulled out of a film project because of a stomach bug. Gallagher has recently been touring in Europe with Oasis and has spent much of the year out of the country on band commitments.",

Only around half of its 15,000 tourist businesses are online. The rest rely on campaigns by the STB, which operates with a \u00a37.5m budget, and the British Tourist Authority.</p> <p>\"E-commerce and IT is crucial to the future success of the industry and there is a real awakening to that,\" said Riddell Graham, of the Scottish Borders Tourist Board. \"Our message to the operators is competition has never been greater. If you sit still you will get left behind.\"</p> <p>George Kerevan, however, says the trade has done little to try to catch up.</p> <p>\"There is a self-satisfaction in the industry.

She credits the shift to an aggressive marketing campaign urging Scots to take short breaks on home soil. \"Maybe it also reflects a new pride in Scotland, with its new parliament,\" she said. \"People want to learn about and visit their own country.\" The slump in overseas trade, she says, is not unexpected and can be blamed partly on weakened European currencies. \"People don't get as much for their Deutschmark here as they used to get.\" Other industry analysts, however, say Scotland is badly served overseas. Only around half of its 15,000 tourist businesses are online. The rest rely on campaigns by the STB, which operates with a \u00a37.5m budget, and the British Tourist Authority. \"E-commerce and IT is crucial to the future success of the industry and there is a real awakening to that,\" said Riddell Graham, of the Scottish Borders Tourist Board. \"Our message to the operators is competition has never been greater. If you sit still you will get left behind.\" George Kerevan, however, says the trade has done little to try to catch up. \"There is a self-satisfaction in the industry. They sell a Scotland they feel comfortable with rather than trying to create a product that suits the market. \"We still sell the twee B&amp;B image; idea that folk are going to come here and look at the views and be satisfied. But people want quality, they want to be comfortable and if you don't give them that, then they'll go elsewhere.\" Hits and Misses What works The scenery: Mountains, lochs, moorland, coast. The family tree: Trace ancestors and wear your tartan. Top attractions: Edinburgh Castle attracts 1.2m visitors during Hogmanay celebrations. Gretna Green is second with 700,000. Golf: Invented here. Annual hordes come to worship at St Andrews. What doesn't The cost: The strong pound, price of rural petrol and crippling internal air fares give you less for your buck. The food: For every choice venison steak there's a lumpy scone and a pot of weak tea. The accommodation: Substandard hotels and guesthouses are still commonplace. The practice: Complacency and a confused administrative structure prevents the message getting through.",

But the draft football (disorder) bill makes clear that the police officer will have to justify to a magistrates court within 24 hours his decision to stop the football fan leaving the country by providing evidence that \"the person involved had caused or contributed to any violence or disorder\".

The chances of the legislation reaching the statute book in time for England's next international game in Paris on September 2 depend upon the co-operation of the Conservatives. The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, yesterday sat on the fence about the extent of her party's support for the bill, saying that its proposals would have to be examined carefully. \"We share the government's desire to see an end to the menace of football hooliganism and will support sensible measures brought forward to curb this problem,\" she said. The draft bill gives police a new summary power to issue a notice preventing a British citizen from travelling abroad to attend a football match if there \"are grounds for believing that the person has previously caused or contributed to any violence or disorder, or if the person's behaviour suggests that enquiries should be made to check whether or not there is evidence to that effect\".

I was just nine.\" Denis Healey's position as defence secretary certainly impinged on his son Tim's student drug-taking days. \"I smoked some dope in my student days, but when I did so, I routinely fell prey to panic,\" he once recalled. \"You know that painting by Munch, The Scream; that kind of panic. In its grip, I imagined my student companions to be Trotskyite provocateurs, CIA agents or KGB stooges out to get at my father through me.\" But many children of politicians have emerged unscathed. Victoria Scott, the disability campaigning daughter of former Tory disability minister Nick Scott, hit the headlines in 1994, when she called for him to resign over his opposition to the Disability Bill. Now 34, Victoria said: \"When I was growing up, dad was just a junior minister and nobody was particularly interested in what I did. It was never ever suggested that I should behave in a certain way because of what my dad did. There were moments when I thought 'I shouldn't do that, because it might reflect badly on my dad', but because he was my father, not because he was a politician. I think children will always embarrass their parents. If they don't, you're doing something wrong.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Malita Maxwell has Aids. But so does just about everybody else in the women's ward of Chiradzulu hospital, with its busted air conditioner, smell of old, sweet urine and greasy mattresses covered in bright green plastic.</p> <p>In the administrator's office, Margaret Kalanda is discussing her staffing difficulties. Two nurses have died of Aids and haven't been replaced. She has also lost a laboratory technician, an electrician and two hospital attendants in the last year. Mrs Kalanda is a graduate of Chancellor college at the University of Malawi. Of her class of 20, three are dead and two are ill with aids.</p> <p>James Morris, the morgue attendant, knows what is happening in this town in south Malawi. But it could be any town in southern Africa where an entire generation are going to their death. After the first sickness from Aids the average Malawian is dead within five years. The women are dying in their 20s, weakened to the virus by childbirth. The men are lasting until their 30s.</p> <p>They all die without any chance of treatment with expensive Aids drugs that could give them another 10 years of life.</p> <p>Mr Morris keeps his morgue well, washing it out every morning with a green garden hose he leaves hanging on the white-washed wall smelling of bleach. The bodies are stacked up until they have two ambulance loads - one going north and one going south. They wait for a job-lot to save on petrol. \"I had two teachers last month. Seems to be more ladies these days. Six ladies to every four men I'd say. They have a baby and then they seem to die.\"</p> <p>Surrounded by the silent, swollen and festering faces of the dying, you cannot help feeling for Malita Maxwell. She is 25 years old and walks stiff as a puppet through the ward, trying to keep the running infection in her legs and groin from rubbing against each other. She was recovering from the death of her son, who lived for a year before her virus killed him. Then her immune system, crushed by Aids, fell to a wild angry thrush that invaded her body.</p> <p>Nurses say they cannot treat her raw, infected sores until she has washed herself with saltwater. She has no money to buy salt. \"I sent a message home that I was in hospital so they could come and see me but no one has come.\" Here patients don't survive without relatives to feed them - the hospital cannot. The government is broke. On the radio at lunchtime the news in English includes an announcement that a Japanese delegation is donating a printing press to the National Bank and a message of congratulations to the Malawian government for its excellent record in paying off its debts to the World Bank and the IMF.</p> <p>Malita Maxwell stands in the middle of the hospital ward with two Panadols in her hand, the only treatment there is. \"Someone has taken the bed,\" she says.</p> <p>When she dies - and it will be soon - she will leave behind three orphaned children. By the end of this year, Africa will have 12.1m orphans.</p> <p>In Durban, South Africa, tomorrow, 9,000 delegates will meet for a UN Aids conference. The primary call for change will be an appeal to drug companies, such as Glaxo Wellcome, which have sold more than \u00a32bn of anti-Aids drugs in the last two years to the first world.</p> <p>\"The thing about the big pharmaceutical companies is that there are no competitors to encourage them to reduce the price. They know that the people are dying here but they don't care. They can charge what the want, so they can charge \u00a3100 a month for treatment in the UK and just forget about countries like these,\" says Elisabeth Poulet of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the aid agency leading the campaign in Durban for pharmaceutical companies to bring down prices.</p> <p>Masida Davila, a 40-year-old accoun tant, is also dying of Aids. His wife died five years ago and he has sent his only child, an 11-year-old girl, to boarding school. It is a Catholic convent and he hopes they will protect her when he dies. Even though he has not long to live he sees her only once every three months so she will not miss him so much. \"She is on my mind all the time. How do I look after my daughter?\"</p> <p>Mr Davila earns \u00a360 a month and cannot pay for the Aids drugs that could give him another 10 years. He is in a race against Aids and for time to provide for her. \"I'm buying shares for her. This month I bought a thousand shares,\" he says.</p> <p>Mr Davila, in his smart green linen suit, buys shares, while Malita Maxwell cannot afford salt, but both are excluded from the world of treatment. By the year 2010 the average person in Malawi will live only to the age of 30, according to the latest report from the UN.</p> <p>\"The emphasis is on saving the children, the next generation, but saving them from what - unless we keep the parents alive there will be nobody to bring them up,\" says Dr Poulet.</p> <p>At 6.30am, as the town bell rings for the healthy to rise, the women are already drying the tobacco leaves under rusting corrugated iron roofs. The smell of bougainvillea, which produces flowers all year round and supplies the wreaths, is in the air. The Rev Hesbesa is attending two to three funerals a days. He is in a good mood today: \"Not a single funeral.\" But late in the evening he gets a call.</p> <p>Gracie Awafie died last Sunday night on a mat made of cardboard laid out under a tree. She slowly choked to death, a combination of tuberculosis and laryngitis - two of the diseases that infect Aids patients. In the last hours her face puffed up like an adder in a last battle against the infections. Cheap drugs were available to treat the infections but her grandmother, an old woman who cannot walk, could not get her to hospital. \"The whole support structure has collapsed,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I'm glad to have visitors,\" she said a couple of hours before Gracie died. \"It's hard being with her all day on my own - in and out. One minute she wants to be inside, one minute she wants to be out.\"</p> <p>Hard words but then Arume Awafie had already nursed her daughter to death from Aids and buried her great-granddaughter. \"We are going to run out of grandmothers soon,\" says Monique van de Kar, who also works for MSF.</p> <p>With powerful anti-Aids drugs such as AZT out of reach in Africa, the country must rely on the condom. But sex and reproduction are part of a culture that encourages promiscuity. Africa is about survival. Breeding to ensure your own survival. It is a culture where marriage parties, harvest festivals, graduations all come with sex. And the introduction of the condom has not been easy.

      "bodyText": "Malita Maxwell has Aids. But so does just about everybody else in the women's ward of Chiradzulu hospital, with its busted air conditioner, smell of old, sweet urine and greasy mattresses covered in bright green plastic. In the administrator's office, Margaret Kalanda is discussing her staffing difficulties. Two nurses have died of Aids and haven't been replaced. She has also lost a laboratory technician, an electrician and two hospital attendants in the last year. Mrs Kalanda is a graduate of Chancellor college at the University of Malawi. Of her class of 20, three are dead and two are ill with aids. James Morris, the morgue attendant, knows what is happening in this town in south Malawi. But it could be any town in southern Africa where an entire generation are going to their death. After the first sickness from Aids the average Malawian is dead within five years. The women are dying in their 20s, weakened to the virus by childbirth. The men are lasting until their 30s. They all die without any chance of treatment with expensive Aids drugs that could give them another 10 years of life. Mr Morris keeps his morgue well, washing it out every morning with a green garden hose he leaves hanging on the white-washed wall smelling of bleach. The bodies are stacked up until they have two ambulance loads - one going north and one going south. They wait for a job-lot to save on petrol. \"I had two teachers last month. Seems to be more ladies these days. Six ladies to every four men I'd say. They have a baby and then they seem to die.\" Surrounded by the silent, swollen and festering faces of the dying, you cannot help feeling for Malita Maxwell. She is 25 years old and walks stiff as a puppet through the ward, trying to keep the running infection in her legs and groin from rubbing against each other. She was recovering from the death of her son, who lived for a year before her virus killed him. Then her immune system, crushed by Aids, fell to a wild angry thrush that invaded her body. Nurses say they cannot treat her raw, infected sores until she has washed herself with saltwater. She has no money to buy salt. \"I sent a message home that I was in hospital so they could come and see me but no one has come.\" Here patients don't survive without relatives to feed them - the hospital cannot. The government is broke. On the radio at lunchtime the news in English includes an announcement that a Japanese delegation is donating a printing press to the National Bank and a message of congratulations to the Malawian government for its excellent record in paying off its debts to the World Bank and the IMF. Malita Maxwell stands in the middle of the hospital ward with two Panadols in her hand, the only treatment there is. \"Someone has taken the bed,\" she says. When she dies - and it will be soon - she will leave behind three orphaned children. By the end of this year, Africa will have 12.1m orphans. In Durban, South Africa, tomorrow, 9,000 delegates will meet for a UN Aids conference. The primary call for change will be an appeal to drug companies, such as Glaxo Wellcome, which have sold more than \u00a32bn of anti-Aids drugs in the last two years to the first world. \"The thing about the big pharmaceutical companies is that there are no competitors to encourage them to reduce the price. They know that the people are dying here but they don't care. They can charge what the want, so they can charge \u00a3100 a month for treatment in the UK and just forget about countries like these,\" says Elisabeth Poulet of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the aid agency leading the campaign in Durban for pharmaceutical companies to bring down prices. Masida Davila, a 40-year-old accoun tant, is also dying of Aids. His wife died five years ago and he has sent his only child, an 11-year-old girl, to boarding school. It is a Catholic convent and he hopes they will protect her when he dies. Even though he has not long to live he sees her only once every three months so she will not miss him so much. \"She is on my mind all the time. How do I look after my daughter?\" Mr Davila earns \u00a360 a month and cannot pay for the Aids drugs that could give him another 10 years. He is in a race against Aids and for time to provide for her. \"I'm buying shares for her. This month I bought a thousand shares,\" he says. Mr Davila, in his smart green linen suit, buys shares, while Malita Maxwell cannot afford salt, but both are excluded from the world of treatment. By the year 2010 the average person in Malawi will live only to the age of 30, according to the latest report from the UN. \"The emphasis is on saving the children, the next generation, but saving them from what - unless we keep the parents alive there will be nobody to bring them up,\" says Dr Poulet. At 6.30am, as the town bell rings for the healthy to rise, the women are already drying the tobacco leaves under rusting corrugated iron roofs. The smell of bougainvillea, which produces flowers all year round and supplies the wreaths, is in the air. The Rev Hesbesa is attending two to three funerals a days. He is in a good mood today: \"Not a single funeral.\" But late in the evening he gets a call. Gracie Awafie died last Sunday night on a mat made of cardboard laid out under a tree. She slowly choked to death, a combination of tuberculosis and laryngitis - two of the diseases that infect Aids patients. In the last hours her face puffed up like an adder in a last battle against the infections. Cheap drugs were available to treat the infections but her grandmother, an old woman who cannot walk, could not get her to hospital. \"The whole support structure has collapsed,\" she says. \"I'm glad to have visitors,\" she said a couple of hours before Gracie died. \"It's hard being with her all day on my own - in and out. One minute she wants to be inside, one minute she wants to be out.\" Hard words but then Arume Awafie had already nursed her daughter to death from Aids and buried her great-granddaughter. \"We are going to run out of grandmothers soon,\" says Monique van de Kar, who also works for MSF. With powerful anti-Aids drugs such as AZT out of reach in Africa, the country must rely on the condom. But sex and reproduction are part of a culture that encourages promiscuity. Africa is about survival. Breeding to ensure your own survival. It is a culture where marriage parties, harvest festivals, graduations all come with sex. And the introduction of the condom has not been easy. There has been little help from the churches. The Catholics, Pentecostalists, Presbyterians and Seventh Day Adventists are all saving souls, building churches and water systems and running literacy classes but they refuse to endorse condoms. Gods flock on earth has so far been reduced by some 31m by Aids. The Rev Howard Mbeza of the Presbyterian church next door to where Malita Maxwell is dying says: \"We don't discourage them. Let's just say we keep silent. But we tell the people they must abstain from sex before marriage and they shouldn't commit adultery.\" In Malawi 10 years ago, when the Aids virus was rampant and ignored by a stern Presbyterian president, young girls were taken out into the bush and prepared for married life.

In such a culture of sexual dictates, multiple partners and women without power, Aids has triumphed. The Aids counsellors' door is painted sky blue but is smeared with the dust of years of African summer and no money for new paint. Outside room 13 Malita Maxwell waits for her counsellor, Angela Makata - a luxury provided by MSF, which also keeps the hospital running. \"She accepted that she was positive she just wanted to know what I could do to help her with her pain.

      "bodyText": "The Nigerian government has formally asked Britain to freeze the bank accounts of the late military dictator General Sani Abacha who is alleged to have stolen $4.3bn during his five years in office from 1993. In what is currently the world's largest case of known government corruption, the Nigerian authorities believe that up to $450m has been deposited by Abacha, his family and associates in some of London's leading banks. The request, part of a world-wide hunt for the Abacha billions, is the latest in a series of disclosures which has exposed weaknesses in the international banking system's regulation of money laundering by corrupt politicians. The size of the accounts identified so far dwarf those found by the Swiss authorities belonging to the former presidents Mobuto of Zaire and Marcos of the Phillipines. Most of the British funds, in more than 20 accounts, are thought to be in branches of the HSBC, Barclays, Citibank, the French bank Credit Agricole-Indosuez, and subsidiaries of two Nigerian and four other European banks. The sheer scale of the military junta's kleptomania only became apparent after Abacha's death from a heart attack in June 1998 while cavorting with three Indian prostitutes. An investigations panel set up by the new government soon recovered nearly $1bn, much of it voluntarily handed over by his son, Mohammed, from accounts he held jointly with a London-based Nigerian businessman and former Abacha aide, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu. In confidential records of a prison interview conducted two months ago by British lawyers pursuing a separate civil litigation case against the Abacha family, Mohammed admitted that his fa ther had given him $700m in cash over a period of two years in bags and boxes.

Swiss charges are also pending against Bagudu and Dharam Vir, an Indian businessman. The Swiss investigating magistrate, Georges Zecchin, is expected to examine possible charges against Swiss financial intermediaries at a later stage of the investigation. Abacha's sons - the eldest, Ibrahim, died in a plane crash in 1996 - and business associates were able to bank the money through British Virgin Island front companies or by failing to identify themselves as linked to the brutal dictator. Officials at Citibank in London and New York, where the two brothers had deposited $107m, were criticised by a US Senate committee last November for failing in their checks on them.

The deal, which will lead to the party embracing the alternative vote (AV) system, will end an internal Labour row between supporters of proportional representation and traditionalists who want to maintain the first-past-the-post system. However, the agreement, which was hammered out at Labour's national policy forum in Exeter, will come as a blow to the Liberal Democrats, who had been pinning their hopes on another system known as AV plus. During yesterday's talks, which included the prime minister's close ally Lord Falconer, the Labour leadership agreed to continue to support the principle of a referendum on electoral reform. But the party refused to give its support to the more proportional AV plus system recommended by Lord Jenkins in his report on electoral reform. The outcome will create tensions with Liberal Democrats who want voters to be given a choice between the Jenkins system and the existing first-past-the-post system in a referendum. Supporters of AV say that it maintains the existing Westminster constituencies, while introducing an element of proportionality to elections. Under AV, voters register their support for candidates in order of preference.

      "body": "<p>A male nurse was given seven life sentences yesterday for manslaughter, rape and drugging women patients.</p> <p>Kevin Cobb, 38, abused his position of trust to prey on vulnerable women who went to the casualty department of St Peter's hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, for help, said Judge Martin Stephens at the Old Bailey. He drugged them with anaesthetic and assaulted them in the knowledge that they would not remember.</p> <p>\"It would be difficult to envisage a greater breach of trust,\" said the judge.</p> <p>The attacks took place after Cobb had inadvertently killed a nursing sister, Susan Annis, 31, whom he had drugged so that he could rape her.

      "bodyText": "A male nurse was given seven life sentences yesterday for manslaughter, rape and drugging women patients. Kevin Cobb, 38, abused his position of trust to prey on vulnerable women who went to the casualty department of St Peter's hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, for help, said Judge Martin Stephens at the Old Bailey. He drugged them with anaesthetic and assaulted them in the knowledge that they would not remember. \"It would be difficult to envisage a greater breach of trust,\" said the judge. The attacks took place after Cobb had inadvertently killed a nursing sister, Susan Annis, 31, whom he had drugged so that he could rape her. The judge said this showed he was a danger to women, as well as someone who had brought the nursing profession into disrepute. Cobb, from Yateley in Hampshire, was convicted on May 17 of seven offences following a four-week trial. He was remanded for reports after the jury found him guilty of the manslaughter of Miss Annis; guilty of four charges of drugging women with intent to rape; and guilty of two offences of rape at St Peter's casualty department. The prosecution told the court that Miss Annis, from Crawley hospital in West Sussex, died at a nurses' home at the Royal Brompton hospital, west London, in November 1996, when her drink was spiked by Cobb. He was arrested in January 1999 after a patient, Janine Cuddington, complained she had blacked out on a hospital trolley and come round to find herself being raped; she has waived her right to anonymity. During his trial Cobb denied using a fast-acting \"date-rape\" style drug, available for use in minor surgery in casualty departments, to stupefy his victims and create memory loss. After the case Detective Superintendent Dave Cook of Surrey police said another woman patient had come forward after recognising Cobb's photograph in newspaper reports, but that would be a matter for the crown prosecution service.

People no longer have the freedom to argue with partners, let children play outside or smack them. Nor are they free to smoke, drink, own guns, adopt a child or walk down a street without negotiating a minefield of regulations, restrictions and surveillance measures.

The internet should not be regulated at all from pornography. \"Hate speech\" by Nazis, anti-semites and racists which advocates violence or discrimination should not be censored.

While sometimes feeling let down by New Labour, floating voters - often instinctive Tories - just can't take to William Hague, or Michael Portillo. \"Something funny about them, a bit wet, wimpish,\" said a middle aged respondent. Andrew Paine added: \"I don't hear anyone saying the Tories are the great white hope.\" That might make Mr Blair rest easier. But it probably won't keep Ken Follett quiet.",

A high court judge ruled that Bonnita Dobson did not use her influence to cut her natural mother out of a will and have the entire property, set in more than an acre of Surrey countryside, left to her. Mrs Dobson, 35, known as Bonnie, is the daughter of Monica Davies, 55, but was adopted by her mother's parents, Annie and Frank Randall, when she was five years old. They all lived at The Shack, Green Lane, Chertsey, which was built by Mr Randall's father in 1935 on the site of an old hut. When Mr Randall died in 1991, he left it to his wife, who made a draft will dividing her estate equally between the children: Monica Davies, Bonnita and a son, John, now 56. But in June 1992, Mrs Randall secretly conveyed the house to Mrs Dobson \"in consideration of her natural love and affection\" and left Mrs Davies' flat, where she had been staying, to return to live with her adopted daughter and her children aged 10 and 14 at The Shack until her death in November 1993. Deputy judge Geoffrey Vos QC said Mrs Randall was found drowned in a pond near The Shack and Mrs Davies blamed Mrs Dobson for her mother's death \"in some unspecific way\". Mrs Davies also began her legal action against Mrs Dobson, seeking a declaration that the conveyance should be set aside on the grounds that Mrs Dobson or her former husband unduly influenced Mrs Randall. The judge, dismissing Mrs Davies's action, said of her: \"She is understandably bitter about having been disinherited, but I am bound to say that I believe that, in these proceedings, she has unjustifiably set out to blacken Bonnie's character.\" Press Association",

The environmental pressure group said the proposed $60bn national missile defence (NMD) scheme would undermine existing disarmament treaties and \"provide additional justification to Russia and China to retain their existing nuclear arsenals, while developing new nuclear weapons that can penetrate any future missile shield\". Greenpeace said its team at the base was equipped with survival gear and supplies for several days. The test was the third in a series, but its timing in the midst of a presidential election campaign was expected to have a significant bearing on President Clinton's decision on whether to go ahead with the system, which is intended to provide a shield against missiles fired from \"rogue states\". A Greenpeace spokesman said a team of activists had entered Vandenberg air force base and reached the silo from which a Minuteman II missile was due to be fired as part of the test.

[US plans] must be taken into account when China decides the size of its nuclear forces.\"</p> <p>President Jiang Zemin criticised NMD on Wednesday in a joint statement with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from a central Asian security summit in Tajikistan. The two leaders said that the plan could trigger a new arms race.</p> <p>Experts say that China possesses a land-based strategic force of only some 20 CSS-4 intercontinental ballistic missiles and a \"very small\" submarine-based missile force. The CSS-4s are capable of reaching the US mainland.</p> <p>Mr Sha argued that China's nuclear forces have always been maintained \"at the lowest necessary level for self-defence\".</p> <p>But the nuclear umbrella provided by NMD in US airspace would undermine the strategic rationale behind China's \"minimum deterrent\". China could no longer be sure that its own missiles would get through to hit targets on the American continent if it first sustained a US nuclear strike.</p> <p>The NMD scheme would destroy China's theoretical \"second strike capability\", which was the basis for an effective deterrence, forcing Beijing to think again.</p> <p>\"The colossal efforts of the US to develop NMD and its attempt to deploy advanced Theatre Missile Defence [TMD] in north-east Asia will constitute a direct threat to the effectiveness of the limited nuclear forces China possesses now,\" Mr Sha concluded.</p> <p>China is still anxious to avoid provoking anti-Beijing sentiment in the US. Mr Sha said that China preferred to give the US the benefit of the doubt and added: \"Even if we deploy, it will take a long time.\" He also gave credit to US efforts for arms control so far.</p> <p>But the US interest in NMD encourages a darker view of America's intentions which has been strengthened by the Kosovo war and the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.</p> <p>China is also deeply suspicious of the US agreement with Japan to study a TMD system ostensibly aimed at protecting against a possible North Korean nuclear threat.</p> <p>Mr Sha said such an anti-missile system meant only to defend US forces stationed abroad would be acceptable. But he feared that TMD could be linked to the defence of the US heartland, particularly if it was extended to cover Taiwan.</p> <p>Critics of Chinese policy towards Taiwan say Beijing's hints about the possible use of force against the island have been counter-productive and strengthen the argument for providing Taiwan with more effective anti-missile defence.</p> <p>But Mr Sha said that China's policy on the use of force has been \"greatly misunderstood\". He went unusually far in claiming that its use was out of the question except in the most extreme circumstances.</p> <p>There were only two scenarios where force could be contemplated: if Taiwan declared independence or in the case of \"foreign aggression\".</p> <p>\"It is unbelievable that the mainland should use force against our brothers and sisters [on Taiwan],\" he insisted.</p>",

The Chinese position was reinforced by the commander-in-chief of Russia's missile defence force, Vladimir Yakovlev, who declared that today's tests represented \"the first step towards global nuclear instability\" and reiterated that they were a \"flagrant violation\" of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. He added that America's development of the missile defence system would encourage other countries to spend vast amounts of money on developing technology to overcome the US barrier. Russia, like China, believes that the system is designed primarily to fend off its own weapons and has indicated that it may abandon all previously signed disarmament treaties if America goes ahead. The spate of Chinese warnings comes ahead of next week's visit to Beijing by the US defence secretary, William Cohen, when the NMD project will be top of the agenda. \"If [NMD] is effective the US will have both huge offensive forces and reliable defensive forces,\" said Mr Sha, the director-general of China's department of arms control and disarmament. \"At that time other nuclear countries like China may again be blackmailed.\" He added: \"China must have the legitimate means for self-defence. [US plans] must be taken into account when China decides the size of its nuclear forces.\" President Jiang Zemin criticised NMD on Wednesday in a joint statement with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from a central Asian security summit in Tajikistan. The two leaders said that the plan could trigger a new arms race. Experts say that China possesses a land-based strategic force of only some 20 CSS-4 intercontinental ballistic missiles and a \"very small\" submarine-based missile force. The CSS-4s are capable of reaching the US mainland. Mr Sha argued that China's nuclear forces have always been maintained \"at the lowest necessary level for self-defence\". But the nuclear umbrella provided by NMD in US airspace would undermine the strategic rationale behind China's \"minimum deterrent\". China could no longer be sure that its own missiles would get through to hit targets on the American continent if it first sustained a US nuclear strike. The NMD scheme would destroy China's theoretical \"second strike capability\", which was the basis for an effective deterrence, forcing Beijing to think again. \"The colossal efforts of the US to develop NMD and its attempt to deploy advanced Theatre Missile Defence [TMD] in north-east Asia will constitute a direct threat to the effectiveness of the limited nuclear forces China possesses now,\" Mr Sha concluded. China is still anxious to avoid provoking anti-Beijing sentiment in the US. Mr Sha said that China preferred to give the US the benefit of the doubt and added: \"Even if we deploy, it will take a long time.\" He also gave credit to US efforts for arms control so far. But the US interest in NMD encourages a darker view of America's intentions which has been strengthened by the Kosovo war and the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. China is also deeply suspicious of the US agreement with Japan to study a TMD system ostensibly aimed at protecting against a possible North Korean nuclear threat. Mr Sha said such an anti-missile system meant only to defend US forces stationed abroad would be acceptable. But he feared that TMD could be linked to the defence of the US heartland, particularly if it was extended to cover Taiwan. Critics of Chinese policy towards Taiwan say Beijing's hints about the possible use of force against the island have been counter-productive and strengthen the argument for providing Taiwan with more effective anti-missile defence. But Mr Sha said that China's policy on the use of force has been \"greatly misunderstood\". He went unusually far in claiming that its use was out of the question except in the most extreme circumstances. There were only two scenarios where force could be contemplated: if Taiwan declared independence or in the case of \"foreign aggression\". \"It is unbelievable that the mainland should use force against our brothers and sisters [on Taiwan],\" he insisted.",

      "bodyText": "Europe's fledgling defence structures have been dealt a new blow by the wholesale theft of computers and furniture from the Brussels building used to plan the union's first military moves. Embarrassed diplomats reported yesterday that 200 computers vanished last weekend from the Justus Lipsius building, the imposing pink marble structure which houses the EU council of ministers. And even worse, it seems to have been an inside job. Whoever took the computers had taste as well as nerve: they also removed three translucent stools by the renowned avant garde designer, Phillipe Starck, on loan from France, which has just begun its turn at the EU presidency. Ominously, the furniture was on display in one of the upper levels of the building -and strictly off limits to journalists and other visitors, suggesting that the theft could only have been committed by civil servants or diplomats. Javier Solana, the EU's defence and foreign policy supremo, has already complained bitterly that his headquarters had \"more holes than a Swiss cheese\" and demanded that it be moved to a more secure site. Mr Solana has the delicate job of keeping the US and the western alliance happy - and persuading them to share their secrets - as the 15-member EU fumbles its way to organising its own modest military moves. But the building's poor defences against spies and terrorists - to say nothing of ordinary thieves - have not inspired confidence. At one stage, contract cleaning staff were discovered to have criminal records, while concealed microphones were found in booths used by the interpreters who are a standard feature of all EU life. Diplomats say the problem is that there is no \"culture of security\" in a building which until this spring had hosted nothing more classified than discussions about agriculture or the environment. Security staff are not even authorised to search cars leaving the underground garage. \"The more brazen thieves don't even take the trouble to hide their booty in the trunk,\" complained one furious official. \"They drive out with it right there on the passenger seat.\"",

      "body": "<p>The fleet of ageing freighters anchored off the ramshackle waterfront suggests a threadbare trade. Ships registered in Panama, Honduras or Belize unload cargoes of outdated consumer goods fit for a charity shop.</p> <p>Piles of unfashionably large stereos, reject shoes, second-hand bicycles and worn clothes choke the port's narrow streets. These are the cast-offs of the richest economy in the world, imported into Haiti from the United States.</p> <p>However, one lucrative commodity which thrives on Miragoane's seaborne traffic - cocaine powder - remains invisible from the quayside. Midway between the coca fields of Colombia and the docks of Miami, Haiti is becoming a crucial staging post in the international drugs trade.</p> <p>\"Ships come and go to Colombia and the US all the time,\" says Jean William Jenty, a candidate in Miragoane's mayoral election. \"Even the police are involved in the [drugs] traffic.</p> <p>\"If you come to this region as an officer, you have to buy the post because it's worth so much. From time to time there are arrests of policemen but they never spend long in prison. They are friendly with people of consequence - and are released quickly.\"</p> <p>In one incident, 150kg of cocaine seized from a truck was impounded in Miragoane's police station and shortly afterwards 10kg of the powder vanished. Seven officers were arrested, followed by three members of the judiciary.</p> <p>The local MP alleged officers had even lent a police car to a drug courier.</p> <p>Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, Haiti's president, admitted to the Guardian that there is a \"big problem\". But he added: \"It's not a problem from Haiti. It's a problem for the drug-consuming countries. Because you have demands you have a market.</p> <p>\"The USA asks us what we are doing to fight drugs. I ask the Americans what they are doing to reduce the demand. We don't produce drugs, we don't consume drugs. We are just a transit point.</p> <p>\"We signed an agreement two years ago with the Americans so that they could enter our airspace and seize boats. But the Americans are more interested in catching boat-people than in catching drugs.\"</p> <p>Even though mangoes, vegetable oils and herbs for perfume are shipped from Miragoane, vessels often set out with empty holds - a sign, according to US Customs, that a voyage involves smuggling.</p> <p>At a waterside cafe,where a large black pig and her litter picked over the waste, Manuel Romero-Napa, an Ecuadorian chief steward from one of the freighters sat drinking with a local crew in dark sunglasses.</p> <p>\"The ships are often flagged to Honduras but owned by Haitians,\" Mr Romero-Napa explains. \"Sometimes you go empty, sometimes carrying a little butter or Barbancourt rum. Returning, you bring all the rubbish from Miami: beds, rice, old fridges, cars - things that are necessary for life in Haiti.</p> <p>\"Some boats do the journey in two to three days. When you pass [the US naval base in Cuba at] Guantanamo Bay, the US coastguards come down close and look [for illegal immigrants].\"</p> <p>And drugs? \"Here it's not safe to talk about that,\" he replied in English, glancing at his companions.</p> <p>It is not only Miragoane, three hours' drive on a pot-holed road west of the capital Port-au-Prince, which is involved in trafficking. Small planes from South America land by night on private airstrips, while speedboats make the journey from the Colombian coast in just eight hours.</p> <p>Around 14% of all cocaine entering the US comes through Haiti, according to a recent report to the US house of representatives. Last year, 75 tonnes of the drug was believed to have been routed through Haiti, an increase of nearly 25% over 1998.</p> <p>The chief of the US drug enforcement agency (DEA) in the Caribbean, Michael Virgil, told a congressional committee in April: \"Haiti's weak democratic institution and eroding infrastructure provide South American-based narcotics traffickers with a path of very little resistance.\"</p> <p>The traditional routes for the Cali and Medellin drug cartels used to be through Mexico, but the DEA has been relatively successful in intercepting their deliveries. The Colombians have consequently switched their routes back through the Caribbean.</p> <p>The trafficking through ports like Miragoane depends on Haiti's desperate poverty, which produces poorly paid officials who are easily corrupted. While the London-based pressure group Jubilee 2000 has pleaded for Haiti's debts to be cancelled to help development, Washington has considered withdrawing aid as a punishment for the country's failure to stem the drugs flow.</p> <p>Profits from the smuggling are visible in the high-walled villas under construction in Petionville on the hills above Port-au-Prince.</p> <p>\"Every day you hear reports of drug shipments by boat or plane,\" said Suzy Castor, the leader of the opposition OPL party. \"This is a country where there is not much money and it's surprising to see $600,000 [\u00a3400,000] houses going up with Mercedes cars in the driveway.\"</p> <p>As many as 1,000 Colombians are also thought to live in the country.</p> <p>Once controlled exclusively by the rich, the drug trade is now pulling in the poor. Earlier this month, a plane that landed at Leogane, south of the capital, was burnt by locals looking for cocaine to sell.</p> <p>In March, villagers on the south coast attacked and sank a French cabin cruiser and a Cuban fishing boat in the hope of finding drugs. And although the vast majority of the cocaine is shipped to the US, there is evidence of small-scale dealing in the worst coastal slums of the capital.</p> <p>Government critics warn that Haiti is in danger of degenerating into a \"narco-state\". But its degeneration may not be such a recent development; evidence of the country's vulnerability to the cartels due to its proximity to Columbia dates back to the 1980s.</p> <p>At that time a senior police officer from Port-au-Prince was reportedly seen on the ranch of Pablo Escobar, the head of the Medellin cartel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fleet of ageing freighters anchored off the ramshackle waterfront suggests a threadbare trade. Ships registered in Panama, Honduras or Belize unload cargoes of outdated consumer goods fit for a charity shop. Piles of unfashionably large stereos, reject shoes, second-hand bicycles and worn clothes choke the port's narrow streets. These are the cast-offs of the richest economy in the world, imported into Haiti from the United States. However, one lucrative commodity which thrives on Miragoane's seaborne traffic - cocaine powder - remains invisible from the quayside. Midway between the coca fields of Colombia and the docks of Miami, Haiti is becoming a crucial staging post in the international drugs trade. \"Ships come and go to Colombia and the US all the time,\" says Jean William Jenty, a candidate in Miragoane's mayoral election. \"Even the police are involved in the [drugs] traffic. \"If you come to this region as an officer, you have to buy the post because it's worth so much. From time to time there are arrests of policemen but they never spend long in prison. They are friendly with people of consequence - and are released quickly.\" In one incident, 150kg of cocaine seized from a truck was impounded in Miragoane's police station and shortly afterwards 10kg of the powder vanished. Seven officers were arrested, followed by three members of the judiciary. The local MP alleged officers had even lent a police car to a drug courier. Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, Haiti's president, admitted to the Guardian that there is a \"big problem\". But he added: \"It's not a problem from Haiti. It's a problem for the drug-consuming countries. Because you have demands you have a market. \"The USA asks us what we are doing to fight drugs. I ask the Americans what they are doing to reduce the demand. We don't produce drugs, we don't consume drugs. We are just a transit point. \"We signed an agreement two years ago with the Americans so that they could enter our airspace and seize boats. But the Americans are more interested in catching boat-people than in catching drugs.\" Even though mangoes, vegetable oils and herbs for perfume are shipped from Miragoane, vessels often set out with empty holds - a sign, according to US Customs, that a voyage involves smuggling. At a waterside cafe,where a large black pig and her litter picked over the waste, Manuel Romero-Napa, an Ecuadorian chief steward from one of the freighters sat drinking with a local crew in dark sunglasses. \"The ships are often flagged to Honduras but owned by Haitians,\" Mr Romero-Napa explains. \"Sometimes you go empty, sometimes carrying a little butter or Barbancourt rum. Returning, you bring all the rubbish from Miami: beds, rice, old fridges, cars - things that are necessary for life in Haiti. \"Some boats do the journey in two to three days. When you pass [the US naval base in Cuba at] Guantanamo Bay, the US coastguards come down close and look [for illegal immigrants].\" And drugs? \"Here it's not safe to talk about that,\" he replied in English, glancing at his companions. It is not only Miragoane, three hours' drive on a pot-holed road west of the capital Port-au-Prince, which is involved in trafficking. Small planes from South America land by night on private airstrips, while speedboats make the journey from the Colombian coast in just eight hours. Around 14% of all cocaine entering the US comes through Haiti, according to a recent report to the US house of representatives. Last year, 75 tonnes of the drug was believed to have been routed through Haiti, an increase of nearly 25% over 1998. The chief of the US drug enforcement agency (DEA) in the Caribbean, Michael Virgil, told a congressional committee in April: \"Haiti's weak democratic institution and eroding infrastructure provide South American-based narcotics traffickers with a path of very little resistance.\" The traditional routes for the Cali and Medellin drug cartels used to be through Mexico, but the DEA has been relatively successful in intercepting their deliveries. The Colombians have consequently switched their routes back through the Caribbean. The trafficking through ports like Miragoane depends on Haiti's desperate poverty, which produces poorly paid officials who are easily corrupted. While the London-based pressure group Jubilee 2000 has pleaded for Haiti's debts to be cancelled to help development, Washington has considered withdrawing aid as a punishment for the country's failure to stem the drugs flow. Profits from the smuggling are visible in the high-walled villas under construction in Petionville on the hills above Port-au-Prince. \"Every day you hear reports of drug shipments by boat or plane,\" said Suzy Castor, the leader of the opposition OPL party. \"This is a country where there is not much money and it's surprising to see $600,000 [\u00a3400,000] houses going up with Mercedes cars in the driveway.\" As many as 1,000 Colombians are also thought to live in the country. Once controlled exclusively by the rich, the drug trade is now pulling in the poor. Earlier this month, a plane that landed at Leogane, south of the capital, was burnt by locals looking for cocaine to sell. In March, villagers on the south coast attacked and sank a French cabin cruiser and a Cuban fishing boat in the hope of finding drugs. And although the vast majority of the cocaine is shipped to the US, there is evidence of small-scale dealing in the worst coastal slums of the capital. Government critics warn that Haiti is in danger of degenerating into a \"narco-state\". But its degeneration may not be such a recent development; evidence of the country's vulnerability to the cartels due to its proximity to Columbia dates back to the 1980s. At that time a senior police officer from Port-au-Prince was reportedly seen on the ranch of Pablo Escobar, the head of the Medellin cartel.",

Yet, the man who has nurtured it through its excruciating birth fails to live up to the stereotype of a flash, brash, arrogant property tycoon. </p> <p>Softly spoken, slightly stooping and modestly but smartly dressed, Paul Reichmann would more easily pass for a slightly eccentric academic than a man who made a fortune - as much as \u00a34bn according to some reports - lost some of it and made it back again through high-profile, controversial property deals, most notably the Canary Wharf complex. </p> <p>Flashing more than 67,000 times a day, the light atop the Canary Wharf tower he has constructed distracts the Queen in Windsor Castle as well as commuters deep in Surrey. The 50-storey building it crowns - Britain's tallest - transforms London's skyline and has courted controversy for almost 20 years. </p> <p>It has been bankrupt and rescued, faced long legal wrangles, been locked in disputes over tax incentives and received an estimated \u00a32bn of government aid. (According to some calculations, taxes paid for 40 of the 50 floors of the tower).

      "bodyText": "Canary Wharf rarely fails to evoke emotion; the Manhattan-style, skyscraper development on the eastern edge of the City of London is either loved or hated, more usually the latter. Yet, the man who has nurtured it through its excruciating birth fails to live up to the stereotype of a flash, brash, arrogant property tycoon. Softly spoken, slightly stooping and modestly but smartly dressed, Paul Reichmann would more easily pass for a slightly eccentric academic than a man who made a fortune - as much as \u00a34bn according to some reports - lost some of it and made it back again through high-profile, controversial property deals, most notably the Canary Wharf complex. Flashing more than 67,000 times a day, the light atop the Canary Wharf tower he has constructed distracts the Queen in Windsor Castle as well as commuters deep in Surrey. The 50-storey building it crowns - Britain's tallest - transforms London's skyline and has courted controversy for almost 20 years. It has been bankrupt and rescued, faced long legal wrangles, been locked in disputes over tax incentives and received an estimated \u00a32bn of government aid. (According to some calculations, taxes paid for 40 of the 50 floors of the tower). Legal issues are still continuing with an arm of the advertising group WPP, while the Treasury has investigated claims by the Corporation of London, the local council for the City, that it benefited unfairly from tax breaks. Soulless and stranded Above all, it is criticised for being the landmark tower of a development which is soulless and stranded, and difficult to get to despite being just three miles from the heart of the capital's financial centre. Reichmann, who dislikes interviews only slightly less than having his photo taken, is now able to explain, however, that the project in which he has been involved in since 1987 is ahead of schedule. This week he announced that he is beginning what many of his detractors thought would never happen: the third phase of its development. It must be a crucial moment in the career of a man who has spent almost 50 years in the cut-throat and volatile world of property, after a frantic journey in his early life across many continents during which he picked up seven languages. His first job was in \"educational work\" in Morocco, the temporary residence of his family when they fled his Vienna birthplace at the outset of the second world war, before reaching Toronto, his home now for more than 40 years. His devotedly Jewish family, five children and grandchildren are all based in Canada. It is in Toronto that the young Reichmann took his first steps into the world of construction and property development. \"Toronto was about a quarter of its present size. It was expanding rapidly. It was a logical thing for a young man to pursue,\" he says. He went on to regenerate the Battery Park area of New York, building the World Financial Centre. Then, with much the same management team, he set his sights on the derelict dock on the Isle of Dogs which was earmarked by Margaret Thatcher for regeneration and became home to the famous tower.

      "body": "<p>In ceramics collecting, or in what might be termed factory ceramics collecting, William Moorcroft and Clarice Cliff are enjoying a tortoise and hare existence. There is a craze for the bright art deco and jazz-age figures of Clarice Cliff. Auctions of her work are packed. Prices seem to go sky-high (more than \u00a318,000 in one instance).</p> <p>But the more restful designs of Moorcroft art nouveau ceramics are also keenly sought and enjoy great popularity. There are 8,000-plus members of the Moorcroft Collectors Club who underpin the output of the Stoke factory, which is still operating and prices are strong.</p> <p>Mark Wilkinson, a specialist at Christie's South Kensington, says: \"They are two completely different markets. You need to be very considered with Clarice Cliff. You almost need to design a room around her wares. But the quieter floral designs of Moorcroft fit in anywhere.\"</p> <p>Christie's has two dedicated auctions of Moorcroft each year and two of Cliff. Overall sales for each work out roughly the same, at around \u00a31m annually.</p> <p>Unusually, Phillip's auction house is holding an auction of both William Moorcroft and Clarice Cliff on Thursday July 13 in London's New Bond Street. Cynics may say that this is an attempt by the revived Phillip's under its new owner, French businessman Bernard Arnault, to break into markets dominated by the other big auction companies, Sotheby's, Christie's and Bonhams. Christie's, South Kensington, has established something of a corner in Clarice Cliff.</p> <p>Johanna Freidwall, specialist at Phillips, says: \"Clarice Cliff is new to us. We have only been doing this for a year.\" It shows. There are few outstanding Cliff pieces in the sale. There are 300 lots but the Moorcroft items are more interesting.</p> <p>William Moorcroft started out 102 years ago, in the heyday of studio pottery, as the chief designer of the Macintyre factory. He was involved in creating what is known as florian ware, pottery drawing heavily on the stylised floral designs of William Morris. In 1913, Macintyre went off to make electrical goods and Moorcroft set up on his own in partnership with Liberty, the London department store.</p> <p>Another difference between Cliff and Moorcroft is that she is dead while the Moorcroft line still exists. William Moorcroft's grandson John Moorcroft is managing director.</p> <p>Ostensibly, little seems to have changed over the years. The designs have broadened out, their colours moving from the yellows and blues and greens with which they are traditionally associated to reds and yellows. But the motifs remain centred still on flowers, wildlife and landscapes. They are still hand coloured and some are characterised by \"tube-lining\", a ceramic equivalent of brocading.</p> <p>The cognoscenti would tell you, however, that there is a difference. Johanna Freidwall says: \"The pieces designed by William were extremely subtle and intricate in their colouring and design. The modern pieces reflect their time. They are bolder and brasher.\"</p> <p>Recent pieces, often issued as limited editions, can fetch high prices. Items from the \"carp decoration\" brought out in the early 90s by Sally Tuffin, until recently chief designer at Moorcroft, have sold for \u00a36,000. But pieces made by William Moorcroft in his heyday in the 1910s and 1920s can be very valuable. At a Christie's sale two bidders chased each other up to \u00a312,550 for a 1928 \"eventide\" baluster vase.</p> <p>At the Phillip's sale there are a number of Eventide pieces. One, a dish decorated with trees in ochre and green against an ochre/red sky, 18.5cm in diameter, is on offer at \u00a3800 to \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Another, a bowl decorated around the sides and to the interior in deep autumnal colours, 21.5in diameter with the signature in blue is priced at \u00a3150 to \u00a3200.</p> <p>Moorcroft is a collectors' market rather than an investors' one. The company organises special weekends for collectors to visit the factory to buy the latest designs. But for those interested in older pieces there are a lot of good value pieces at the Phillip's sale. Those favouring particular designs such as the pomegranate or wisteria, early florian wares or later flambe ceramics, will find them, like the Eventide, starting at around \u00a3150.</p> <p>Prices for old Moorcroft pieces might not be as acrobatic as Cliff, but enthusiasts who buy now will almost certainly find they have a steadily rising investment.</p> <p>For further information: Phillips, tel: 020-7629-6602.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In ceramics collecting, or in what might be termed factory ceramics collecting, William Moorcroft and Clarice Cliff are enjoying a tortoise and hare existence. There is a craze for the bright art deco and jazz-age figures of Clarice Cliff. Auctions of her work are packed. Prices seem to go sky-high (more than \u00a318,000 in one instance). But the more restful designs of Moorcroft art nouveau ceramics are also keenly sought and enjoy great popularity. There are 8,000-plus members of the Moorcroft Collectors Club who underpin the output of the Stoke factory, which is still operating and prices are strong. Mark Wilkinson, a specialist at Christie's South Kensington, says: \"They are two completely different markets. You need to be very considered with Clarice Cliff. You almost need to design a room around her wares. But the quieter floral designs of Moorcroft fit in anywhere.\" Christie's has two dedicated auctions of Moorcroft each year and two of Cliff. Overall sales for each work out roughly the same, at around \u00a31m annually. Unusually, Phillip's auction house is holding an auction of both William Moorcroft and Clarice Cliff on Thursday July 13 in London's New Bond Street. Cynics may say that this is an attempt by the revived Phillip's under its new owner, French businessman Bernard Arnault, to break into markets dominated by the other big auction companies, Sotheby's, Christie's and Bonhams. Christie's, South Kensington, has established something of a corner in Clarice Cliff. Johanna Freidwall, specialist at Phillips, says: \"Clarice Cliff is new to us. We have only been doing this for a year.\" It shows. There are few outstanding Cliff pieces in the sale. There are 300 lots but the Moorcroft items are more interesting. William Moorcroft started out 102 years ago, in the heyday of studio pottery, as the chief designer of the Macintyre factory. He was involved in creating what is known as florian ware, pottery drawing heavily on the stylised floral designs of William Morris. In 1913, Macintyre went off to make electrical goods and Moorcroft set up on his own in partnership with Liberty, the London department store. Another difference between Cliff and Moorcroft is that she is dead while the Moorcroft line still exists. William Moorcroft's grandson John Moorcroft is managing director. Ostensibly, little seems to have changed over the years. The designs have broadened out, their colours moving from the yellows and blues and greens with which they are traditionally associated to reds and yellows. But the motifs remain centred still on flowers, wildlife and landscapes. They are still hand coloured and some are characterised by \"tube-lining\", a ceramic equivalent of brocading. The cognoscenti would tell you, however, that there is a difference. Johanna Freidwall says: \"The pieces designed by William were extremely subtle and intricate in their colouring and design. The modern pieces reflect their time. They are bolder and brasher.\" Recent pieces, often issued as limited editions, can fetch high prices. Items from the \"carp decoration\" brought out in the early 90s by Sally Tuffin, until recently chief designer at Moorcroft, have sold for \u00a36,000. But pieces made by William Moorcroft in his heyday in the 1910s and 1920s can be very valuable. At a Christie's sale two bidders chased each other up to \u00a312,550 for a 1928 \"eventide\" baluster vase. At the Phillip's sale there are a number of Eventide pieces. One, a dish decorated with trees in ochre and green against an ochre/red sky, 18.5cm in diameter, is on offer at \u00a3800 to \u00a31,000. Another, a bowl decorated around the sides and to the interior in deep autumnal colours, 21.5in diameter with the signature in blue is priced at \u00a3150 to \u00a3200. Moorcroft is a collectors' market rather than an investors' one. The company organises special weekends for collectors to visit the factory to buy the latest designs. But for those interested in older pieces there are a lot of good value pieces at the Phillip's sale. Those favouring particular designs such as the pomegranate or wisteria, early florian wares or later flambe ceramics, will find them, like the Eventide, starting at around \u00a3150. Prices for old Moorcroft pieces might not be as acrobatic as Cliff, but enthusiasts who buy now will almost certainly find they have a steadily rising investment.

Some would argue Britain would do well to rejoin a system from which it was so ignominiously ejected in 1992 on the grounds it would allow time for the pound to settle at an appropriate euro entry level. It is not a view that finds favour in official quarters. No doubt that will provide Mr Duisenberg with the wherewithal for further undiplomatic interventions in Britain's euro debate. Cash cowed Meanwhile, back in the euro zone, the European commission reckons there is still plenty of work to be done getting the area's citizens and businesses up to speed. According to a commission poll published yesterday, businesses are reluctant to use the euro, even though it has been available in virtual form since the beginning of last year. Moreover, consumers are still confused about when and how notes and coins will be introduced, with just over half feeling they were insufficiently informed about the single currency.",

Publication of the text of the proposed new law this week prompted a highly critical reaction from church leaders, rightwing opposition politicians and even a senior minister in Germany's centre-left coalition cabinet. The issue is supremely delicate in a country where up to 15,000 homosexual men were put to death under the Third Reich. Homosexual acts were banned by law until 1969 and while Berlin has established itself as a \"gay capital\", attitudes in the rest of the country remain relatively conservative. This is particularly so in staunchly Roman Catholic Bavaria, the stronghold of the Christian Social Union (SCU), which has promised implacable opposition to the bill. The party's general secretary, Thomas Goppel, called the measure \"juridically superfluous and socially unacceptable\". The government's proposals are an attempt to make good on 1998 campaign promises. As tabled, the bill would enable officially registered homosexual couples to file joint tax returns, claim social security benefits to which they are currently not entitled, and be treated in much the same way as married men and women for the purposes of inheritance and gift tax. It would not allow them to adopt children. But it would give them new rights under the immigration laws - an important point for gay couples in which one of the partners is a foreigner, and a highly controversial one for those concerned that it would create a new loophole for foreigners seeking German residence or nationality. The Social Democrats' interior minister, Otto Schily, this week broke ranks with his party colleagues to condemn the proposed new measure. He argued that it could undermine the unique rights accorded to married couples in the German constitution. The bill was attacked on similar grounds by leading Catholic and Protestant churchmen. Conservatives in parliament have said they will try to have the bill thrown out when it reaches the upper house where the \"red-green\" coalition lacks a majority. But it remains to be seen whether the main Christian Democratic party, the Christian Democrat Union (CDU) will take the same aggressive line as its Bavarian sister party. The CDU is struggling to overcome the damage caused by the scandal over its illegal funding under the former chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and can ill afford to alienate the \"pink vote\". The party's general secretary, Ruprecht Polenz, was noticeably more muted in his criticism and stressed the CDU's respect for same-sex partnerships.",

The study, commissioned by the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees called on EU countries to adopt common \"legal and safe migration opportunities for all refugees\", while bringing \"the full weight of international justice\" to bear on traffickers. It said human trafficking has become virtually the only escape route for those entitled to protection in Europe and contradictory policies appear to harm the victims more than the traffickers. The study found that trafficking involves between one-third and two-thirds of the main nationalities who go on to have their refugee claim accepted on the grounds of persecution, including Iraqis, Afghans, and Yugoslavs. Around 250,000 people seek asylum every year in Europe. \"The main nationalities that are being smuggled and trafficked to Europe to claim asylum are those same nationalities that are recognised as refugees by European countries themselves. Yet, these are the same nationalities that have been the main target of all European anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling activity,\" it says. There has been a shift in the past decade from traditional deception - where migrants travel on invalid documents - to \"clandestine methods\" where they resort to traffickers or smuggling rings because of tighter obstacles to entry: 56% of illegal entries to Britain in 1998 were clandestine. The study says politicians have created \"public confusion and mistrust on issues of asylum policy\", clouded by secrecy. \"Stop calling people illegal migrants or aliens if in fact you know these people are refugees legally entitled to asylum,\" its author, John Morrison, said.",

Its decision, announced by Kim Howells, the Welsh MP who is competition minister, is bound to trigger a new phase in the bid war for Wales's largest public corporation between WPD and its rival, Japanese bank Nomura. Nomura, which has bid 260p a share or \u00a3401m against WPD's 300p, remains under pressure to raise its offer but last night welcomed Mr Howells's statement. The Welsh assembly, backed by Rhodri Morgan, first secretary, urged the DTI to ask Brussels to hand the bid back to Britain because it believes the US offer involves the break-up of Hyder and the effective merger of its water business Dwr Cymru with United Utilities, leading to the loss of hundreds of Welsh jobs. WPD's offer would leave ownership of Welsh Water's assets in its hands but transfer management to Warrington-based United which would also acquire Hyder's non-regulated services business. WPD would take on electricity distributor Swalec but assembly members feared it would be merged with its Bristol-based power business, South Western Electricity. Mike German, Liberal Democrat leader in the assembly, accused WPD of secret \"sale of shares\" arrangements with United to hand over the employment contracts of thousands of Hyder staff to United. WPD executives insisted that the arrangements had been disclosed to both the DTI and office of fair trading and denied any threat to jobs beyond 1,000 redundancies planned by Hyder. \"I think we will win and that will be the best outcome for the business and the people of Wales,\" one insider said. \"We are an experienced utility and I don't think Nomura is in there for the long term.

Please keep up the good work. Howard Rose Dublin v-hrose@microsoft.com \u0095 As one of the few remaining devotees of Spam, I was pleased to see its history in G2 (Play it again, Spam, July 7). Sorry to carp but I found the headline less to my taste than a fritter. I would have preferred: I'm pink, therefore I'm Spam. Ed Lilley Bristol",

The president of Fifa would then use his casting vote and South Africa would win the right to stage the 2006 World Cup. But then came a twist none had foreseen. When the final vote was taken, the 78-year-old representative of New Zealand, mandated to vote for South Africa once England was out of the chase, was inexplicably missing. So Germany, host nation as recently as 1974, won by a single vote, and hugely deserving South Africa was sent empty away.</p> <p>Even if we were not in the backwash of disclosures of cricketing fraud, most people would scent something fishy here; all the more so because this decision, which had so much hanging on it in terms of national prestige and political and economic consequence, came out of a world thick with clandestine deals and inducements.

      "bodyText": "The contest, it seemed, could have only one outcome. With England and Morocco out of the hunt, Germany and South Africa were destined to tie, 12 votes each. The president of Fifa would then use his casting vote and South Africa would win the right to stage the 2006 World Cup. But then came a twist none had foreseen. When the final vote was taken, the 78-year-old representative of New Zealand, mandated to vote for South Africa once England was out of the chase, was inexplicably missing. So Germany, host nation as recently as 1974, won by a single vote, and hugely deserving South Africa was sent empty away. Even if we were not in the backwash of disclosures of cricketing fraud, most people would scent something fishy here; all the more so because this decision, which had so much hanging on it in terms of national prestige and political and economic consequence, came out of a world thick with clandestine deals and inducements. Past deals helped determine the outcome here, while others we do not yet know about may already have written the script for the next round in four years time. England's bid cost some \u00a310m - no more than Arsenal routinely spends on fresh French arrivals, maybe, but money which could have funded many worthwhile projects elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "The first execution by US federal authorities in nearly four decades is likely to be delayed, it was reported yesterday. The expected stay of execution was prompted by concerns that the chances of being sentenced to death are often determined by the defendant's race and where the trial was held, and comes at time when capital punishment has become a presidential election issue. Most Americans still support the death penalty, but the nation's certainty has been jolted recently by a series of high-profile cases in which death row inmates have been exonerated and their trials shown to have been flawed. At the same time, the US press has been scrutinising the Republican contender, George W Bush, over the record number of executions he has overseen as Texas governor. But the federal execution due on August 5 of a convicted triple murderer, Juan Raul Garza, would focus attention back on President Clinton and the Vice-President Al Gore, Mr Bush's Democratic opponent. They both support capital punishment, but have also voiced concern about the recent string of errors. Garza's lawyers had filed an appeal claiming that the imposition of the death penalty was racially weighted. Of the 21 inmates now on federal death row, 17 are black or Hispanic. President Clinton has ordered an investigation into the claims of bias. He has also asked the justice department to draw up a formal procedure that would make it easier for federal death row inmates to ask for clemency. According to the New York Times, Garza's execution is likely to be put off at least until the justice department has completed its review. If the sentence is carried out, Garza will be the first federal inmate to be executed since John F Kennedy's presidency. The death penalty was suspended by the supreme court in 1972 and only reinstated 12 years ago. Most capital crimes are tried in the state courts, but in 1988, amid fears that drugs would fuel a rising tide of violent crime, Congress gave federal prosecutors the right to call for the death penalty for a list of aggravated crimes. The legislation has mostly been applied to drug-related murders. Garza was sentenced to death under this \"drug kingpin statute\" in a federal court seven years ago. He ran a drug smuggling operation across the Texas-Mexican border and was convicted of murdering three people who got in his way. There is no dispute that non-white prisoners are over-represented on death row, but proponents of capital punishment argue that those figures simply mirror the crime statistics. Opponents argue that black or Hispanic defendants are far more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants who have committed the same crimes. The justice department study is supposed to untangle the statistics to reveal any pattern of prejudice in federal courts. It is also supposed to look into the fact that, of the 471 death penalty cases referred to the attorney general by federal prosecutors between 1995 and 1998, 200 came from five judicial districts: Puerto Rico, Eastern Virginia, Eastern New York, Southern New York and Maryland. Defence lawyers argue that the figures show that death sentences are not evenly applied. Garza's lawyer, Gregory Wiercioch, said that his appeal for clemency would emphasise the discriminatory nature of death sentences in the US. He said its imposition was like a \"rigged lottery\" in which the outcome was determined by \"the colour of your skin and where you purchased your ticket\". President Clinton last week also expressed concern over \"the disturbing racial composition\" of the inmate population on federal death row. He added that the geographical disparities in sentencing \"raises the question whether, even though there is a uniform law across the country, what your prosecution is may turn solely on where you committed the crime\".",

You look up from the promenade and find you're staring at a quite different woman from the one you started with. You form a circle, but someone isn't fast enough, gets left out, and can only return by smashing into a different part of the line to grab a random hand. By the last number, the place is in total chaos, with people frolicking around in no order at all, bouncing off each other, desperately gazing for someone they came with. It's great fun. </p> <p>The point of barn dances in the old west, I assume, is that it not only brought together all the unmarried men and women from miles around, but it allowed them to have brief but real physical contact with all the others.

Then came buggies, light and easy to fold. Now we have strollers, and they're getting bigger. They have bumpers like dodgem cars, gigantic parasols, running boards, eight chunky wheels like goods lorries. With a bit of carbon fibre cladding you could send your baby into battle. The other day I saw a mother failing to get the buggy through the end door of a tube. She had to retreat and missed the train.

Everything about this crazed plan was naff. The fact that it was dreamed up in a panic because the focus groups say the government appears soft on crime. The way it was inserted into a speech to a body titled The Global Ethics Foundation, which is surely about grander issues than fat louts chanting \"I'd rather be a Paki than a Turk\" in the street. It's as if Mr Blair had been asked to deliver the Reith lectures and had devoted them to complaining about the Grundys in The Archers. </p> <p>But most of all it was stupid because they hadn't asked the police. They hadn't consulted the very people who would have had to enforce the policy in the first place. It's unimaginable to us. No wonder the Tories have been enjoying every moment, conjuring up fantasies of lines of staggering hooligans trying to remember their Pin numbers. If we approached our work in the same careless, slapdash, headless-chicken manner, we'd be out on our ears. They're like accountants who can't add up, lifeguards who can't swim.

In many musicals they were only acceptable in what were called \"speciality numbers\", detached from the plot, which could be easily cut from the film on release in the bigoted South. As a result, the dazzling dancing duo, the Nicholas Brothers, can only be a footnote (or feetnotes) to the history of the Hollywood musical.</p> <p>Harold Nicholas, who has died aged 79, was seven years younger than his brother Fayard, and when they began in vaudeville aged seven and 14 respectively, lanky Fayard towered over his little brother. The better-looking Harold remained much shorter and slighter, but this did not disturb the perfect unity of their actions; any differences in their vertiginous dancing were revealed when they each did a solo spot during a number in an attempt to top one another in friendly sibling rivalry.</p> <p>The sons of musicians, they and their sister began dancing at black vaudeville theatres billed as the Nicholas Kids. As a duo, they performed at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem in the early 1930s, moving on to the famed Cotton Club, and a short film called Pie, Pie, Blackbird (1932).</p> <p>After Samuel Goldwyn saw the brothers at the Cotton Club, he cast them in the tiny roles of street urchins in the Eddie Cantor musical Kid Millions (1934). Back on stage, they appeared in Blackbirds of 1936, which came to London. The Times critic wrote that the audience did not know whether to admire more Harold's \"twinkling feet or slow, baby smile.\"</p> <p>The Nicholas Brothers' feet and smiles enlivened several Fox musicals during the 1940s. Among their show-stopping numbers was Chattanooga-Choo-Choo in Sun Valley Serenade (1941), which was sung by Dorothy Dandridge, whom Harold married the following year. They divorced soon after their daughter was born.</p> <p>Harold and Fayard also had snazzy dance routines in Down Argentine Way (1940), Tin Pan Alley (1940), and Orchestra Wives (1942), combining elegance with extraordinary acrobatics. They called their dancing \"classical tap\", a blend of jazz, tap, acrobatics (with supple splits), angular eccentricmovement, black vernacular dance and ballet.</p> <p>\"People always asked did we study ballet,\" Harold remarked. \"We never did.\" However, ballet choreographer George Balanchine cast them in The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 and Babes in Arms (1937) on Broadway.</p> <p>In the all-black musical Stormy Weather (1943), their Jumpin' Jive number provoked Fred Astaire to declare that it was the greatest movie musical moment he had ever seen. \"We had a huge set made of big steps,\" Harold recalled. \"My brother would jump over my head into a split on the step below me. I'd do the same thing over his head until we both got down on the floor.\" The brothers also dance on drums and leap over orchestra musicians.</p> <p>In Vincente Minnelli's The Pirate (1948), their last feature together, Gene Kelly broke the colour bar by dancing with them in the rousing Be A Clown number. Dressed in the same blue-and-yellow motley, they formed a tumbling equilateral triangle in constant motion, a distinct change from the segregated specialities imposed upon the brothers during their screen career. Even though they are hardly distinguishable behind white clown's make-up, the routine was excised from the film in the South.</p> <p>In recent years, Harold and Fayard were feted in the US, the subject of a tribute at Carnegie Hall in 1998, and recipients of honorary awards galore. They also charmed audiences in person at a season at the National Film Theatre in London a few years ago.</p> <p>Before and after the Nicholas Brothers split up, Harold had a separate career. As a 12-year-old, he appeared in Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones; he introduced the song, Come Rain or Come Shine in the 1946 production of St Louis Woman; and later had a role in Sidney Poitier's Uptown Saturday Night (1974), as well as starring in the Broadway Duke Ellington musical Sophisticated Ladies in 1982 and in the touring musical The Tap Dance Kid (1985).</p> <p>There is a wonderful moment in the film Tap (1989), when a young hoofer unwisely suggests a group of legendary old dancers has lost their legs. One of them is 68-year-old Harold Nicholas, who accepts the challenge with enthusiasm, and does his stuff, bringing back memories of the glory days of tap dancing and movie musicals.</p> <p>He is survived by his brother, his third wife, a daughter and a son.</p> <p>\u0095 Harold Lloyd Nicholas, dancer, born March 21 1921; died July 3 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "For most of Hollywood's existence, racial segregation and prejudice forced great black artists to play minor or subservient roles. In many musicals they were only acceptable in what were called \"speciality numbers\", detached from the plot, which could be easily cut from the film on release in the bigoted South. As a result, the dazzling dancing duo, the Nicholas Brothers, can only be a footnote (or feetnotes) to the history of the Hollywood musical. Harold Nicholas, who has died aged 79, was seven years younger than his brother Fayard, and when they began in vaudeville aged seven and 14 respectively, lanky Fayard towered over his little brother. The better-looking Harold remained much shorter and slighter, but this did not disturb the perfect unity of their actions; any differences in their vertiginous dancing were revealed when they each did a solo spot during a number in an attempt to top one another in friendly sibling rivalry. The sons of musicians, they and their sister began dancing at black vaudeville theatres billed as the Nicholas Kids. As a duo, they performed at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem in the early 1930s, moving on to the famed Cotton Club, and a short film called Pie, Pie, Blackbird (1932). After Samuel Goldwyn saw the brothers at the Cotton Club, he cast them in the tiny roles of street urchins in the Eddie Cantor musical Kid Millions (1934). Back on stage, they appeared in Blackbirds of 1936, which came to London. The Times critic wrote that the audience did not know whether to admire more Harold's \"twinkling feet or slow, baby smile.\" The Nicholas Brothers' feet and smiles enlivened several Fox musicals during the 1940s. Among their show-stopping numbers was Chattanooga-Choo-Choo in Sun Valley Serenade (1941), which was sung by Dorothy Dandridge, whom Harold married the following year. They divorced soon after their daughter was born. Harold and Fayard also had snazzy dance routines in Down Argentine Way (1940), Tin Pan Alley (1940), and Orchestra Wives (1942), combining elegance with extraordinary acrobatics. They called their dancing \"classical tap\", a blend of jazz, tap, acrobatics (with supple splits), angular eccentricmovement, black vernacular dance and ballet. \"People always asked did we study ballet,\" Harold remarked. \"We never did.\" However, ballet choreographer George Balanchine cast them in The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 and Babes in Arms (1937) on Broadway. In the all-black musical Stormy Weather (1943), their Jumpin' Jive number provoked Fred Astaire to declare that it was the greatest movie musical moment he had ever seen. \"We had a huge set made of big steps,\" Harold recalled. \"My brother would jump over my head into a split on the step below me. I'd do the same thing over his head until we both got down on the floor.\" The brothers also dance on drums and leap over orchestra musicians. In Vincente Minnelli's The Pirate (1948), their last feature together, Gene Kelly broke the colour bar by dancing with them in the rousing Be A Clown number. Dressed in the same blue-and-yellow motley, they formed a tumbling equilateral triangle in constant motion, a distinct change from the segregated specialities imposed upon the brothers during their screen career. Even though they are hardly distinguishable behind white clown's make-up, the routine was excised from the film in the South. In recent years, Harold and Fayard were feted in the US, the subject of a tribute at Carnegie Hall in 1998, and recipients of honorary awards galore. They also charmed audiences in person at a season at the National Film Theatre in London a few years ago. Before and after the Nicholas Brothers split up, Harold had a separate career. As a 12-year-old, he appeared in Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones; he introduced the song, Come Rain or Come Shine in the 1946 production of St Louis Woman; and later had a role in Sidney Poitier's Uptown Saturday Night (1974), as well as starring in the Broadway Duke Ellington musical Sophisticated Ladies in 1982 and in the touring musical The Tap Dance Kid (1985). There is a wonderful moment in the film Tap (1989), when a young hoofer unwisely suggests a group of legendary old dancers has lost their legs. One of them is 68-year-old Harold Nicholas, who accepts the challenge with enthusiasm, and does his stuff, bringing back memories of the glory days of tap dancing and movie musicals. He is survived by his brother, his third wife, a daughter and a son. \u0095 Harold Lloyd Nicholas, dancer, born March 21 1921; died July 3 2000",

I know he is a best-selling novelist and perhaps he uses his holidays to think up new plots, but in the light of his outburst against Tony Blair in last week's Observer, I think he should also find time to look at a little history. </p> <p>Follett seems to suppose that spinning, manipulating, and the settling of scores between ministers through unattributable briefings were invented by Margaret Thatcher and Bernard Ingham. I suggest he starts with a history of the Attlee government - there are several - for there he will find inter-ministerial feuding and blackguarding far outreaching anything we have seen under Tony Blair. </p> <p>Many senior ministers openly loathed and denounced each other. When someone remarked that Herbert Morrison, Attlee's deputy, was his own worst enemy, the former union leader Ernie Bevin, who was Attlee's foreign secretary, retorted: \"Not while I'm alive he ain't.\" That story, significantly, is also told about Morrison and the left-wing firebrand Nye Bevan, and even about Bevin and Bevan (whom people now sometimes assume, even in serious newspapers, were one and the same person.) Great fountains of venom spurted up at the very mention of the mischievous Hugh Dalton or Attlee's calamitous minister for fuel and power, Emmanuel Shinwell. As for Attlee, there were several attempts to remove him, in some of which left-wingers like Stafford Cripps allied themselves with right-wingers like Morrison. No one is talking of dumping Tony - yet. </p> <p> Next, Ken should get hold of Ben Pimlott's book on Wilson (large, but worth it) and the diaries of Richard Crossman and Barbara Castle, where he will find plots and mighty feuds and petty envies and spites and vicious briefings and counterbriefings which will make his expensive coiffure stand on end. I also recommend a book by the Sunday Times's political man of those days, James Margach, called The Abuse Of Power - subtitled The War Between Downing Street and the Media - which recounts Wilson's paranoid rage against those newspapers (most of them) which refused to see things as he did and which he took to be in the pocket of enemies like Roy Jenkins. There were cabinet meetings in Wilson's four terms as prime minister which, unlike today's, thrashed out the issues at length with commitment and passion; but the terms in which they were reported frequently owed more to surreptitious briefings than to what had really occurred. </p> <p>As a veteran of the 1974-1979 governments said to Smallweed this week, the people whom the media made prime movers in those debates had often in fact said least, while those who said most, and to greatest effect, were barely mentioned at all. Afterwards Wilson would make frantic, doomed attempts to pin down the source of leaks, while telling proprietors and editors to get rid of those whose reporting upset him most. None of this is to say that Follett's disgust is unjustified - any more than it was unjustified when much the same case was made by others, like the party's former deputy leader and general secretary, who know rather more about these matters than he does. </p> <p> One more book to complete Ken's holiday reading: a life of King Alfred. All he knows about this king, he wrote in the Observer, is that he burned some cakes. A good life of Alfred - there are several, starting with the king's contemporary Asser - would open Ken's eyes to rather more important aspects of Alfred than cake (that incident probably never happened) such as his success in repelling the Danes, his promotion of learning, his consolidation of the burgeoning English monarchy, and so on. Some also credit him with achievements like founding Oxford university or establishing trial by jury: but such claims were probably the work of spin doctors (or flamsters, as I prefer to call them). </p> <p> But Ken should rely on historians more accomplished than Smallweed. The account in this column last week of the battle of the medieval schoolmen, in which the nominalists took on the realists, has been challenged this week in an erudite letter from The Queen's College, Oxford. \"Realists,\" it explains, \"were not insisting on the reality of tables. It was abstract concepts (eg whiteness) that they claimed had a reality of their own, whereas nominalists believed these concepts were just names, and that the only realities were individual white objects. Nominalists were thus, in modern terms, more realistic than realists.\" I hope this makes everything clear. </p> <p><strong> Next week in Smallweed: </strong> Anna Kournikova; nominalist or realist? (with amazingly yummy pictures of Elizabeth Hurley). </p> <p> Smallweed was treated on Monday to a persuasive interpretation of the term \"at sixes and sevens\". This had to do, a representative of one of the London livery companies explained, with the trial of strength which took place in the 14th and 15th century between the Skinners and Merchant Taylors as to who should be sixth and who seventh in the companies' pecking order. This led to bumping and bruising. But in 1484 the Mayor of the City, as arbitrator, ruled that the two should alternate: one would be sixth this year and the other seventh; next year, the other way round. </p> <p>Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable thinks the term comes from dicing. \"There is,\" a book of 1542 explains, \"a proverb omnem jacere aleam, to cast all dice by which is signified to set all on six and seven_ assaying the wild chance of fortune, be it good, be it bad.\" But since the mayor's ruling predated this reference by 58 years, who can be sure which came first? From now on I shall adopt the livery companies' explanation in odd-numbered years, and the book's in even-numbered years like this one.</p>",

Better than me anyway. She read books. She lived the life. She ate out. She had many admirers. She could cope with the frightening talents of Anna Raeburn and Sally Vincent. As editor, I was delighted to have such good company facing me across our awful desks. Blowsy bouquets of flowers from Berwick Street market appeared on the desk and her perfume changed with the arrival of new product samples.</p> <p>After several happy years with this jolly assistant, she asked for a long weekend to fly to Los Angeles to see her scriptwriting boyfriend. On her return Genevieve regaled us with what it's like fixing your mascara in the same bit of mirror as Elizabeth Taylor at the Oscars. Do write it down, Gen dear, I said. She did and I lost a PA and found a writer. Genevieve went on to become the first woman editor of the Sunday Times colour supplement.</p> <p>Being Gen, she also brought back from Frederick's of Hollywood an edible bikini. Lacking an immediate partner, Genevieve and chum ate the red liquorice straps and chocolate body right there in the office.</p> <p>Genevieve, with her discreet charm, eagle eye for social change, her blue stocking well concealed under that toile de jouy exterior, was in effect the spirit of the new age: liberated, opinionated, iconoclastic - watch how she changed the face of newspapers - funny and sometimes unbearably vulnerable. A pencil often held back those curls. Minus Doc Martens and dungarees, she cut the feminist mustard.</p> <p>Genevieve was born in Nottingham: her mother a journalist on the Sunday Times, her father an executive at Marks &amp; Spencer. She attended a succession of local schools due to the family's constant moving and at 16 was already working as a secretary.</p> <p>It was at Cosmo that her career bloomed. Compiling a what's on, what's in column, she went to a boutique opening in Covent Garden where she met a man in a pink sweater, 13 years' younger and gorgeous. He must be gay, she told the office.</p> <p>Craftily the young man, Peter Knight, used his advantage to entice the cautious Ms Cooper. A colleague said: \"Genevieve is doing her best not to get married.\" At this point and well before Fleet Street, Cosmopolitan went into computers. Peter, now a computer expert, was in the building a lot and an office romance was launched. Reader, she married him.</p> <p>Fleet Street also made Genevieve proposals and we watched as she applied her talent, charm and compassion to the flinty surface of newspapers in the 70s and 80s. In 1983 it was at the Mail On Sunday's You magazine, and a year later came the editorship of the Sunday Times colour supplement. There she wrote a piece explaining how no, she wasn't the features editor, or the woman's editor, she was the Editor, dammit.</p> <p>She went on to become the London Evening Standard's deputy editor, before working for the newly launched London Daily News and then launching the Standard's ES magazine. In her turn Genevieve helped the careers of many new young writers including Nigella Lawson, Jaci Stephens, Lowri Turner and Annalena McAfee.</p> <p>Last month I saw her for the last time. All those smart editorships behind her, a little stooped with cancer, but the same wonderful smile, the curly hair, the fluttering lashes, the jokes, the wicked stories of news-paper chicanery.</p> <p>She was resting in the house and garden of her friend Pattie Barron, surrounded by flowers, cats, books and magazines. What shall we all be reading tomorrow? Such a good time. Thank you Genevieve.</p> <p>She is survived by Peter and her 12-year-old son Max.</p> <p>\u0095 Genevieve Hope St Clair Cooper, journalist, born December 10 1944; died June 26 2000</p>",

She could cope with the frightening talents of Anna Raeburn and Sally Vincent. As editor, I was delighted to have such good company facing me across our awful desks. Blowsy bouquets of flowers from Berwick Street market appeared on the desk and her perfume changed with the arrival of new product samples. After several happy years with this jolly assistant, she asked for a long weekend to fly to Los Angeles to see her scriptwriting boyfriend. On her return Genevieve regaled us with what it's like fixing your mascara in the same bit of mirror as Elizabeth Taylor at the Oscars. Do write it down, Gen dear, I said. She did and I lost a PA and found a writer. Genevieve went on to become the first woman editor of the Sunday Times colour supplement. Being Gen, she also brought back from Frederick's of Hollywood an edible bikini. Lacking an immediate partner, Genevieve and chum ate the red liquorice straps and chocolate body right there in the office. Genevieve, with her discreet charm, eagle eye for social change, her blue stocking well concealed under that toile de jouy exterior, was in effect the spirit of the new age: liberated, opinionated, iconoclastic - watch how she changed the face of newspapers - funny and sometimes unbearably vulnerable. A pencil often held back those curls. Minus Doc Martens and dungarees, she cut the feminist mustard. Genevieve was born in Nottingham: her mother a journalist on the Sunday Times, her father an executive at Marks &amp; Spencer. She attended a succession of local schools due to the family's constant moving and at 16 was already working as a secretary. It was at Cosmo that her career bloomed. Compiling a what's on, what's in column, she went to a boutique opening in Covent Garden where she met a man in a pink sweater, 13 years' younger and gorgeous. He must be gay, she told the office. Craftily the young man, Peter Knight, used his advantage to entice the cautious Ms Cooper. A colleague said: \"Genevieve is doing her best not to get married.\" At this point and well before Fleet Street, Cosmopolitan went into computers. Peter, now a computer expert, was in the building a lot and an office romance was launched. Reader, she married him. Fleet Street also made Genevieve proposals and we watched as she applied her talent, charm and compassion to the flinty surface of newspapers in the 70s and 80s. In 1983 it was at the Mail On Sunday's You magazine, and a year later came the editorship of the Sunday Times colour supplement. There she wrote a piece explaining how no, she wasn't the features editor, or the woman's editor, she was the Editor, dammit. She went on to become the London Evening Standard's deputy editor, before working for the newly launched London Daily News and then launching the Standard's ES magazine. In her turn Genevieve helped the careers of many new young writers including Nigella Lawson, Jaci Stephens, Lowri Turner and Annalena McAfee. Last month I saw her for the last time. All those smart editorships behind her, a little stooped with cancer, but the same wonderful smile, the curly hair, the fluttering lashes, the jokes, the wicked stories of news-paper chicanery. She was resting in the house and garden of her friend Pattie Barron, surrounded by flowers, cats, books and magazines. What shall we all be reading tomorrow? Such a good time. Thank you Genevieve. She is survived by Peter and her 12-year-old son Max. \u0095 Genevieve Hope St Clair Cooper, journalist, born December 10 1944; died June 26 2000",

      "body": "<p> Loyalty was once the Conservative Party's secret weapon, its absence the Labour Party's public disease. In an effort to overcome the vitiating effects of the quarrels and rifts which so undermined voter confidence in Old Labour, leaders of New Labour sought to manage their party with the same discipline as once benefited Conservatism. But as Ken Follett's putatively disloyal attack on Mr Blair's alleged disloyalties to his Cabinet colleagues suggests, the endeavour is in difficulties. </p> <p>The kind of loyalty once instinctive among Tories seems to be an inherent impossibility for Labourites, either because their instincts are those of opposition and therefore Opposition - which perhaps some of them secretly prefer, since it is so much easier to complain than to govern - or because their adherence is to ideals, not people, which means that loyalty to the former necessitates disloyalty to the latter when the latter are disloyal to the former. </p> <p>Loyalty is only a virtue when it is principled. Unquestioning allegiance to a cause, a faith or an individual is bad because by its nature it is too easily made an instrument of wrongdoing - and indeed amplifies wrongdoing, for when instructions are blindly followed they are thereby potentiated. Even as an instrument of good its value is equivocal; a loyal servant is the mere vehicle of another's intentions, therefore little praise is due to him beyond the mere fact that he yields himself to his master. </p> <p>The concepts most associated with loyalty are constancy, fidelity and trustworthiness. These can be virtues indeed, and the fact that they play a central role in loyalty explains why we think well of it. Generally, in praising loyalty we really mean to praise one or more of these virtues, and when we decry it - as when the Stalinist apparatchik carries out a purge, and the SS officer a gassing - we described it as misplaced, mistaken or blind. But if it can be these things, it only deserves its positive light when it represents a principled adherence to something independently defensible as good. </p> <p>Loyalty to a verifiable good is not a requirement in politics, where, on the contrary, Elbert Hubbard's dictum that \"an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness\" very much applies. An individual MP is seen by party whips as a pair of feet for the voting lobbies, and - if those same feet are not too often in it - another mouth for the propaganda war. To be loyal in party terms means being quiescent, obedient and obliging. Loyalty to principle, to constituents, or to a cause which happens not to be party policy is regarded as rank disloyalty. </p> <p>This is what offends independent minds on both right and left, thinking of their forerunners: the former, of the bluff squires of Walpole's day, stubbornly forming their own views no matter what the Crown's ministers wanted; the latter, of their roots running deeply via dissent to Wat Tyler and beyond. It is a fact of history that independent-mindedness has more often been found in the latter camp than the former. </p> <p>In personal life loyalty is a less equivocal virtue. In friendship it means standing by someone despite occasions of disagreement and disapproval, for friendship is first about fidelities and only afterwards about what tests them. The component virtues of constancy and trustworthiness are especially valuable in friendship when troubles come, because they are an infinitely greater comfort to anyone sleepless in the dark night of the soul than such impersonal helps as medications, counsellors or prayers. </p> <p>\"Men's minds are given to change in hate and friendship,\" said Sophocles, which explains some of the rifts and reconciliations seen in public life. If Follett's attack on Blair was prompted by a sense of personal rather than political disloyalty, it would explain its bitterness of tone: as it would if Blair felt the same in response, for every blow of disloyalty against one who stands naked to the public gaze is, by that very fact, trebled in the harm it does, thus making disloyalty a kind of assassination - sometimes needful, sometimes wanton. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Loyalty was once the Conservative Party's secret weapon, its absence the Labour Party's public disease. In an effort to overcome the vitiating effects of the quarrels and rifts which so undermined voter confidence in Old Labour, leaders of New Labour sought to manage their party with the same discipline as once benefited Conservatism. But as Ken Follett's putatively disloyal attack on Mr Blair's alleged disloyalties to his Cabinet colleagues suggests, the endeavour is in difficulties. The kind of loyalty once instinctive among Tories seems to be an inherent impossibility for Labourites, either because their instincts are those of opposition and therefore Opposition - which perhaps some of them secretly prefer, since it is so much easier to complain than to govern - or because their adherence is to ideals, not people, which means that loyalty to the former necessitates disloyalty to the latter when the latter are disloyal to the former. Loyalty is only a virtue when it is principled. Unquestioning allegiance to a cause, a faith or an individual is bad because by its nature it is too easily made an instrument of wrongdoing - and indeed amplifies wrongdoing, for when instructions are blindly followed they are thereby potentiated. Even as an instrument of good its value is equivocal; a loyal servant is the mere vehicle of another's intentions, therefore little praise is due to him beyond the mere fact that he yields himself to his master. The concepts most associated with loyalty are constancy, fidelity and trustworthiness. These can be virtues indeed, and the fact that they play a central role in loyalty explains why we think well of it. Generally, in praising loyalty we really mean to praise one or more of these virtues, and when we decry it - as when the Stalinist apparatchik carries out a purge, and the SS officer a gassing - we described it as misplaced, mistaken or blind. But if it can be these things, it only deserves its positive light when it represents a principled adherence to something independently defensible as good. Loyalty to a verifiable good is not a requirement in politics, where, on the contrary, Elbert Hubbard's dictum that \"an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness\" very much applies. An individual MP is seen by party whips as a pair of feet for the voting lobbies, and - if those same feet are not too often in it - another mouth for the propaganda war. To be loyal in party terms means being quiescent, obedient and obliging. Loyalty to principle, to constituents, or to a cause which happens not to be party policy is regarded as rank disloyalty. This is what offends independent minds on both right and left, thinking of their forerunners: the former, of the bluff squires of Walpole's day, stubbornly forming their own views no matter what the Crown's ministers wanted; the latter, of their roots running deeply via dissent to Wat Tyler and beyond. It is a fact of history that independent-mindedness has more often been found in the latter camp than the former. In personal life loyalty is a less equivocal virtue. In friendship it means standing by someone despite occasions of disagreement and disapproval, for friendship is first about fidelities and only afterwards about what tests them. The component virtues of constancy and trustworthiness are especially valuable in friendship when troubles come, because they are an infinitely greater comfort to anyone sleepless in the dark night of the soul than such impersonal helps as medications, counsellors or prayers. \"Men's minds are given to change in hate and friendship,\" said Sophocles, which explains some of the rifts and reconciliations seen in public life. If Follett's attack on Blair was prompted by a sense of personal rather than political disloyalty, it would explain its bitterness of tone: as it would if Blair felt the same in response, for every blow of disloyalty against one who stands naked to the public gaze is, by that very fact, trebled in the harm it does, thus making disloyalty a kind of assassination - sometimes needful, sometimes wanton.",

During the past few days, children and locals from Stratford have been made to feel as good about themselves as the Royal Ballet's Edward Watson and Deborah Bull. </p> <p>As well as being a community project, Field was conceived as a showcase for the cavernous magnificence of Stratford's local cinema, the Rex.

The dancers perform on a conventional stage, which doubles as a 3-D screen on which footage of people and landscape is projected. But interestingly the modesty of the technology becomes a virtue rather than a disappointment. For in some ways Field is the most intimately human work McGregor has made. </p> <p>One factor is his untypical use of live music, specially written by composer Tunde Jegende, whose breezy fusion of Baroque, South East Asian, jazz and minimalism generates a far more extrovert quality than the electronic scores McGregor generally favours. Jegende's restless sonorities and pulsing rhythmic structures stimulate McGregor's own musical invention, and give a physical warmth to the virtuosity of Random's dancers, who open the show in a series of solos and duets. These actually feature modern dance at its most technically powered, with extravagantly stretched lines of movement sliced into drastic angles or teased into edgily delicate ripples. Yet as the local dancers are gradually incorporated into the work, it is extraordinary how seamlessly the two teams blend and how the amateurs become assets to the dance rather than liabilities. </p> <p>McGregor certainly exploits the latter's strengths, giving the younger ones moves based on hip-hop and gymnastics, the older ones more low-key social dance steps, which he then breaks down into tiny modules of movement and reactivates into his own distinctively hyperactive style. He also enjoys the varieties of body size, placing tiny tots in sculptural contrast with more chunky adults and he deliberately retains the colours of their personalities. </p> <p>Within the kaleidoscopic, shifting patterns created by the 40 dancers, there are moments where the stage jitters with the anarchic energy of a playground, and moments too where it settles into the more orderly fun of a ballroom. In one unexpectedly poignant duet, one of Random's dancers is partnered by a middle-aged Asian man, whose courtliness and calm inspire you to picture him practicing t'ai chi on the banks of the River Lea. </p> <p>Of course, McGregor relies on his own dancers to weave a thread of virtuosity through the main fabric of the dance, but it's often surprisingly hard to tell the two groups apart. The pace of the choreography changes so fast, its ideas come in such quick profusion that despite its length (an hour), it rarely flags. Nor do Stratford's dancers. Their discipline and focus are impressively unwavering and it's a tribute to them and to Random that Field is community dance with a genuinely professional edge.</p>",

At least there's a bit of life there. </p> <p>In the middle of the show there's a metal structure by Liam Gillick, standing in the centre of the long corridor-like space running the length of the exhibition.

The intelligence is, however, that Gordon is a shy and lonely cove who never goes out, and this list is a plea for help. </p> <p>Oladele Ajiboye Bamgboye's video, Spells for Beginners, in which the artist and his ex-girlfriend discuss, off-screen, why they split up, is too tersely edited to be mere confessional, too studied to be sentimental. On the screen snow falls, a boy walks down steps, a younger, dreadlocked Bamgboye takes a bath. The couple's downfall comes alive. The work is also a revisitation of the artist as a young man, as it reworks footage from 1994. There's a lot of feeling in the film, but it is tempered by rectitude and distance. </p> <p>Wearing's slowed-down video of a drunken woman is, by contrast, alarmingly sentimental. Wearing filmed a damaged street drinker she'd befriended; the woman died. Over silent footage of the woman talking, drinking and leering, the woman's twin sister talks about the booze, the overdoses, the wrecked life, the funeral. I guess this work is a kind of eulogy, but it ends up sickly. </p> <p>But there is only one major, lasting work in the exhibition. White egrets sit in a green tree. A tropical storm moves in, flattening the sea. The building, a hurricane-proof, utopian modernist egg in the Cayman Islands, is slowly falling apart. The owner is in jail. The camera watches, looking in and looking out. Rain falls through the shell of the echoing house. I cannot tell you how beautiful is Tacita Dean's film of this house she found by accident. Her film replays in my head, as an epitaph to someone else's dream. </p> <p>Intelligence here is her noticing how loaded and metaphoric and condensed something seen can be. The house is a found object, someone else's lost hope. This work is so dense and rich and potent that everything else here looks struggled for, too formulaic, too clever by half. </p> <p>\u0095 Intelligence is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8000), till September 24.</p>",

Or it could be showing off. The intelligence is, however, that Gordon is a shy and lonely cove who never goes out, and this list is a plea for help. Oladele Ajiboye Bamgboye's video, Spells for Beginners, in which the artist and his ex-girlfriend discuss, off-screen, why they split up, is too tersely edited to be mere confessional, too studied to be sentimental. On the screen snow falls, a boy walks down steps, a younger, dreadlocked Bamgboye takes a bath. The couple's downfall comes alive. The work is also a revisitation of the artist as a young man, as it reworks footage from 1994. There's a lot of feeling in the film, but it is tempered by rectitude and distance. Wearing's slowed-down video of a drunken woman is, by contrast, alarmingly sentimental. Wearing filmed a damaged street drinker she'd befriended; the woman died. Over silent footage of the woman talking, drinking and leering, the woman's twin sister talks about the booze, the overdoses, the wrecked life, the funeral. I guess this work is a kind of eulogy, but it ends up sickly. But there is only one major, lasting work in the exhibition. White egrets sit in a green tree. A tropical storm moves in, flattening the sea. The building, a hurricane-proof, utopian modernist egg in the Cayman Islands, is slowly falling apart. The owner is in jail. The camera watches, looking in and looking out. Rain falls through the shell of the echoing house. I cannot tell you how beautiful is Tacita Dean's film of this house she found by accident. Her film replays in my head, as an epitaph to someone else's dream. Intelligence here is her noticing how loaded and metaphoric and condensed something seen can be. The house is a found object, someone else's lost hope. This work is so dense and rich and potent that everything else here looks struggled for, too formulaic, too clever by half. \u0095 Intelligence is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8000), till September 24.",

It simply recounts the aboriginal experience in fluid and entertaining form. </p> <p>What it proves - not unlike the South African production of The Island - is that good theatre is the best way of recording social injus tice. Harrison's method is to focus on five characters. We meet Shirley, the classic earth mother, desperate to find her abducted kids and see her grandchildren.

      "body": "<p>Her Majesty's Leader of the Opposition and would-be First Minister William Hague is arriving at the Police Federation in Brighton for a speech. His car stops and the waiting camera crews scramble as he, accompanied by a single aide, sweeps in through the doors. \"When are you going to have a baby,\" shouts a lone female camerawoman. Hague, his bald head gleaming like a beacon, strides past into the hall. The Police Federation welcoming party instantly becomes a swarming phalanx of jumping, swirling camera crews, burly police sergeants, burning television lights and scurrying photographers, snaking its way through the conference centre. We march forward deeper and deeper, a procession bathed in light, now of seeming power and destiny, and arrive at our destination, the elevators.</p> <p>It's the end of the line for the media, but not for the Guardian, as we rise in the lift towards the VIP suite, where William, as he is universally known to his aides, will briefly prepare himself before his big speech of the day on crime, law and order, more bobbies on the beat, the heart of the Tory heartland. In the non-descript room, the walls lined with tables covered with plates of biscuits and bottles of mineral water, he stands in the centre, making awkward small-talk with the chairman of the Police Federation. He wears a blue suit and one of those big, silky politician's ties. Hague is enveloped by the aura and armour of leadership; in another life, this could be the first meeting of the take-over team who are going to sack everyone. Even in this inner sanctum, there are 20 people: party press officers, a documentary crew and his hosts. Every eye is upon him; this room is just another public stage. Hague asks for a private moment - to put on make-up for the television cameras - and we are all briefly expelled.</p> <p>Later, ready to make his speech, he pauses in the darkness by the side of the stage, looking out over ranks of middle-aged policemen settling down for the show. Hague at last seems to relax. He stands there, self-contained, peering into the middle distance, confident that he is again in his element, assured of his audience. Soon, these beer-gutted coppers with their bad ties and shiny suits will be chortling in their seats at the Tory leader's gags, applauding his attacks on crime, relishing the verbal boot going into Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw.</p> <p>It is a moment to ponder. Is this the next British Prime Minister? Can Hague win for the Tories this time, or even the next time? Will he be Prime Minister in 2001 or 2006? Or never? Can the Tory Boy Wonder destroy the might of New Labour? Or will the Great British nation always see him as that geeky man-child, prematurely old, 16 going on 45, dressed in an appalling adolescent tweed blazer giving that \"famous speech\" at the 1977 Tory party conference, an instantly retrievable icon in the national archive somewhere between the three-day week, power cuts and Mrs T in a polka-dot dress on the steps of 10 Downing Street.</p> <p>At the back of the hall, staring down impassive and unrelenting, are the electoral gods, the TV cameras, beaming out their message to the great beyond of low, high and middle England. The next general election is at least a year away, maybe two, but its outcome may be determined long before then; the winners, the losers, indelibly marked by the coming propaganda war of headlines. There is a short, expectant burst of applause, Hague moves forward into the light, and takes another step closer towards that final destination: Downing Street or defeat.</p> <p>The past month or so has seen the first glimmerings of hope for 39-year-old William Hague. After three years of political oblivion, the Tories are back in the game. For the first two years of New Labour, the Tories were a sad political joke. \"Jesus Christ himself could not have revived the fortunes of the Tory Party,\" quipped Steve Norris, the defeated Conservative London mayoral candidate.</p> <p> But the sheen of invincibility has come off New Labour. There are a hundred different explanations, but most centre on the hubris of Blair and the Downing Street machine. The Millennium Dome is a disaster, the Ken Livingstone fiasco has virtually destroyed the London Labour party, and Wales is only just recovering from Blair's destructive urge for rigging internal party elections. The economy might be strong and the government competent, but the days of passion for the New Labour project are gone; the party's membership is dropping through the floor. Suddenly, when Tone gets a few slow hand-claps at the WI, the newspapers are filled with talk of a political revolution. The mood music is changing.</p> <p>For a long time, Hague as Tory leader was a joke himself; a weirdo who grew up reading Hansard instead of comics and who would never be trusted by the electorate. When Hague spoke, no one listened; when he issued policy statements, no one cared. He was, it was believed, just keeping the seat warm for Michael Portillo to return and stab him in the back. But Hague has proved far more wily than his many enemies in the Tory party. Conservative Central Office has been purged, the Shadow Cabinet reshaped, and dissident heavyweights such as Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine marginalised. Cleverly, Hague has also neutralised Portillo by putting him in the front line against Chancellor Gordon Brown, who presides over Labour's greatest success, the economy. Portillo's lacklustre performances, his new-found self-doubt - fatal in a Conservative leader - have not gone unnoticed on the Tory backbenches.</p> <p>Hague's triumph over his leadership rivals is the triumph of instinct over calculation. </p> <p>\"I know a lot of people who have calculated everything in their life, every step of the way, and most of them are disappointed,\" he says. \"Most of them have not achieved the things they have wanted. Sometimes you have to roll the dice, to take the opportunity, even though it's fraught with difficulties and dangers.\"</p> <p>Hague has gone on the attack on Europe, on asylum seekers, on crime, on pensions, on school expulsions and, in the latest twist, on abortion and the death penalty. His slogan is the \"Commonsense Revolution\", but it is just the old Tory heartland agenda: bigger handcuffs, longer sentences, fewer foreigners, and tougher rules for the wrong sort of people. He is moving to the Right, moving back to where he came from, an instinctive child of Margaret Thatcher - though he is surprisingly unsentimental about her. Yes, he was upset when she was ousted by the party, but within hours you begin planning for the future, move one. Nevertheless, he has absorbed the message of her leadership. \"I turn out to be more successful at doing what I am doing when I am just myself. The more I have done it by instinct, by belief, by just being myself, the more successful I have become.\"</p> <p>Hague's traditional Tory promise to tax less but somehow spend more on public services such as health and education is, on a serious fiscal level, seriously unconvincing. But elections are not won or lost by a detailed perusal of Treasury estimates. Fear, prejudice, scare stories and a gut instinct for hitting the right political nerve, and leadership, were the decisive factors that created the succession of Conservative Party victories in the Thatcher era. It is clear that Hague plans to fight on the same battleground. \"The Tory Party is always at its strongest when it is practical and when representing an instinct,\" explains Hague, outlining the philosophical basis of his populist message. \"The attack of the Left on Thatcher used to be that she was ideological. But she was not ideological, she was very instinctive. The people were ready for this, and this was what had to be done for the country if it was not to become an economic backwater. The Conservative Party through the ages represents the instincts of the country. I have a good sense of what Labour voters think, as well as what Tory voters think. And I think the Labour Party is just beginning to realise that.\" </p> <p>Raising the temperature on asylum was probably key. Hague's language - \"bogus asylum seekers\", \"racketeers\", \"criminal gangs\" - bordered on incitement, but it played well down at the bowls club, and at the Daily Mail. \"Forget the reality,\" said one of his Labour opponents. \"Hague used the issue to redefine himself. The one thing a politician cannot afford is to be laughed at. It's much better to be thought of as frightening and nasty.\" </p> <p>Similarly, Hague's exploitation of the case of Tony Martin - the Norfolk farmer convicted of murder after shooting a burglar on his property - by calling, vaguely, for a reform of criminal legislation was a deft political stroke. \"Tony Martin was so successful not because there are lots of us who feel the need to shoot burglars,\" said a Conservative leader writer, \"but because it is the sort of view we would all probably endorse in a Surbiton pub: \u00a5Good on him'. It's the sort of view that politicians never endorse and we resent them for it. But here was a politician endorsing it and providing intellectual reasons to make us feel better about our own prejudices.\" </p> <p>Playing the race card, and banging the law-and-order drum, may be the quickest way in British politics to build up your enemies, but Hague's true passion is Europe. He himself coined the party's slogan - \"In Europe, not run by Europe\" - as a shorthand for his hostility to the onward march of the euro and further political union. Single-handedly, his personal anti-Europeanism, and Labour's nervousness about an election battle with the Tories over the pound, has stifled any real open political dialogue about the euro, and preserved sterling.</p> <p>Hague has no regrets: \"If I did not stand for keeping the pound, the whole body politic in Britain would have conspired against the public to join the euro. And that would have been the position of the Conservatives as well. It certainly happened in other European countries, where people had no choice. It may be true that three-quarters of all Germans did not want to join the euro, but nobody represented them.\"</p> <p>Hague's opposition to the euro, like his opposition to lots of things to do with change, is instinctual. \"Across the world, conservatives are people who believe in certain continuities and fixed loyalties. That's why conservatives tend to be people who believe in nation and family and pride - those things above ideologies - and oppose changes that would get rid of those things.\" But the philosophical plasticity of conservative \"instinct\" does allow William a get-out clause. \"We are not a party against change. We are a party against change for change's sake. Sometimes, we think its necessary to make radical economic or constitutional change to continue to have a free, prosperous society.\"</p> <p>\"You have got to realise that William is back where he wanted to be,\" said a Tory activist. \"For the past two years, the Conservative Party has been told it has to change to take account of the \u00a5New' Britain. William has decided that those advocating this change are our enemies, not our friends. They are people who will never be in favour of the Conservative Party or Britain.\" In the future, there will be no more baseball caps, and no talk about compassion.</p> <p>Hague's job description as Leader of the Opposition is not to help the Labour governance of Britain run smoothly. His role is to destroy it. If he fails, none of his policy pronouncements will matter. And if he wins, well, government is an entirely different state of affairs from promises made long ago in opposition. But, in order to win, Hague has to do his damnedest to destroy New Labour. \"William is aware of his strengths and his weaknesses,\" said his biographer Jo-Anne Nadler, whose book, William Hague: In His Own Right, will be published later this year. \"All the comments about his appearance, his voice, it does not personally bother him. He realises that people are not going to come round to him until they have started hating Blair. The sheen has to come off Tony Blair.\" </p> <p>It is not all media spin. Tony Blair, baby Leo aside, looks tired, weary. At Prime Minister's Question Time, Blair seems increasingly rattled, like a young barrister undergoing the ordeal of his first day in court. On his feet, Blair grips the dispatch box, digging the heels of his hands into the corner as if to distract himself from the pain of this, and his, performance. His body language is unmistakable: he hates and fears every second of this ritual.</p> <p>Feet away, across the floor, Hague almost lounges, waiting for the moment to strike. At Question Time, the chamber is packed, a noisy crowd gathered. The air is a hubbub of muttered insult, asides, shouts. Hague rises and his voice cuts the air, and he is off with some cleverly-rehearsed quip that usually draws shameful sniggers from the Labour backbenches. He is full of glee as he lashes again and again at his opponent. Blair flicks through his Civil Service briefing book to find the right answer. Sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't, but he never looks happy until Madam Speaker calls time. </p> <p>Even some of those who have reason to hate Hague's guts believe he is doing a good job at besting Blair. \"William is taking the fight to Labour,\" said John Redwood, who Hague sacked from the Shadow Cabinet. \"He is far more courageous and determined than most of his Shadow Cabinet colleagues. He is showing the way to oppose. He is not afraid to spark controversy.\" In the village that is Westminster, the conventional wisdom, up until now, says none of this matters; the British public doesn't care who scores the most debating points. The polls consistently show Labour leading the Conservatives by 10 or more points, and generally give Blair double the personal approval rating of Hague.</p> <p>But other conservative voices, his contemporaries as junior ministers, are less charitable than Redwood about Hague. \"He is creepy, and I think the British public will never elect him,\" said one. \"If he had married Ann Widdecombe, it really would be a marriage of true losers. I cannot remember one single memorable thing he has done in his life apart from that speech.\"</p> <p>In the past, Hague's failure to make a wider electoral impact has been blamed on his poor televisual skills. He has none of the telegenic intimacy that made Blair so convincing on the morning of Princess Diana's death. In contrast, Hague's performance that morning was as stilted as a dead tree. \"There is no question about it, William Hague does look odd on television,\" says Adam Boulton, Sky News's political editor. \"And his recent haircut has not improved it. He just never looks good or relaxed. He does not seem to think it's important. He is far more interested in platform speeches and House of Commons rhetoric.\" But then, no one in television in the past has ever treated Hague as a serious contender. It is only in the past few weeks that Hague has started to get the top radio and television news slots. There is one truism about television and politics that will work to his advantage: political figures who get on the telly tend to stay on the telly.</p> <p>Hague is clever, a robust political warrior, and his recent progress has certainly not slipped the attention of the current occupants of No10. \"To his credit, when things were tough, he toughed it out,\" said one insider. \"Hague had a terrible press, a lot of it unfair. He just kept going, and I admire that in a politician. He is tactically clever but strategically hopeless. The tax guarantee [Hague's stated commitment to lower the burden of taxes regardless of the state of the world economy in the next Parliament] will kill him. Every day we are clocking spending commitments by him or his Shadow ministers. He can come up with his little lines, but elections are won on the big issues and the big arguments. And, let's face it, this guy is a political obsessive. He did grow up reading Hansard, and there is something odd about that.\"</p> <p> Downing Street's arguments are not entirely convincing. Politics, particularly in the absence either of ideological division or committed, class-based electoral support, becomes a blur of vague focus-group perceptions, a half-remembered catalogue of events and electoral promises, likes and dislikes. Image is everything. New Labour itself came to power by a steady war of attrition on fatcats, Tory sleaze and one failed Back-to-Basics relaunch after another under a flailing John Major. Labour is still a long way from losing, but in recent months Hague indisputably has helped heighten some vague electoral unease. These things are intangible, nebulous, but all the more dangerous for being so. Blair should have returned from paternity leave in triumph - a new father, the proverbial successful, virile son-in-law you wished you had - but instead he walked straight into an open hunting season on the \"out-of-touch metropolitan liberal elite\".</p> <p>Within minutes of ending the Brighton speech, we are off to Scotland. At Glasgow airport, Hague passes through virtually unrecognised. Scotland has long ceased to be a Tory heartland; the party was wiped out in 1997 and has not one sitting MP. There are 72 Westminster seats in Scotland. Realistically, there are now just five Scottish constituencies where the party has any chance of regaining a seat. The Scottish Tories' best bet is Eastwood in the suburbs of Glasgow, whose 11,800 Conservative majority was reversed by a 15% swing into a 3,000 Labour majority at the last election. Hague has gone north to host a fund-raising dinner for the prospective candidate, Raymond Robertson, a former MP and now chairman of the party in Scotland.</p> <p>But our first stop is the television studios. Hague repeats the line about crime that he used in his Police Federation speech, attacking faddish New Labour and, by implication, all this new-fangled racial awareness nonsense. \"We need more PCs and less PC.\" He and his press secretary, Amanda Platell, want to keep focused on the law-and-order message.</p> <p>Like any politician, Hague's lines, however sincerely delivered, are carefully pre-scripted. At any one moment he can churn out 20 or maybe 30 little sound-bites on whatever issue the interviewer presses the button on. It is an essential tool of the politician's trade, and Hague has nearly mastered it to perfection. Each little line is important, not just for what it says, but for what it does not say.</p> <p>The best one, which we heard repeated, word perfect, half-a-dozen times over the following 24 hours, was on asylum seekers. \"We have chaos in the asylum system. We believe we have to have firm but fair immigration controls. The people who should feel most offended, and often do feel most offended, by the abuse of the asylum procedures, are people who are immigrants to this country and have gone through all the proper procedures, filled in the forms, waited years and have gone through every rule and regulation and waited to bring their families into this country. And then they see that the system can be completely abused and circumvented by people claiming political asylum who are not political refugees at all. We say we have to put that right, and it's practical common sense to put it right.\"</p> <p>The intention is to convince you that Hague is reflecting the concerns of Britain's Asian population, their anger at this unregulated flood of immigrants. No, no, it's nothing to do with the old unfashionable Powellite Tory race card; it's Britain's existing immigrants who are annoyed at these bogus asylum seekers.</p> <p>It is an unabashed non-sequitur: the political crisis over asylum seekers has nothing to do with mythical protests by British Asians and everything to do with ugly racial attitudes by British whites. It is the reverse of the truth. But, as Hague and his advisers know, the message, the code hidden inside his sound-bite, will still connect to this racist constituency - you can only really trust the Tories to keep those foreigners out.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,340869,00.html\">Read the second part of Little boy blue here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Her Majesty's Leader of the Opposition and would-be First Minister William Hague is arriving at the Police Federation in Brighton for a speech. His car stops and the waiting camera crews scramble as he, accompanied by a single aide, sweeps in through the doors. \"When are you going to have a baby,\" shouts a lone female camerawoman. Hague, his bald head gleaming like a beacon, strides past into the hall. The Police Federation welcoming party instantly becomes a swarming phalanx of jumping, swirling camera crews, burly police sergeants, burning television lights and scurrying photographers, snaking its way through the conference centre. We march forward deeper and deeper, a procession bathed in light, now of seeming power and destiny, and arrive at our destination, the elevators. It's the end of the line for the media, but not for the Guardian, as we rise in the lift towards the VIP suite, where William, as he is universally known to his aides, will briefly prepare himself before his big speech of the day on crime, law and order, more bobbies on the beat, the heart of the Tory heartland. In the non-descript room, the walls lined with tables covered with plates of biscuits and bottles of mineral water, he stands in the centre, making awkward small-talk with the chairman of the Police Federation. He wears a blue suit and one of those big, silky politician's ties. Hague is enveloped by the aura and armour of leadership; in another life, this could be the first meeting of the take-over team who are going to sack everyone. Even in this inner sanctum, there are 20 people: party press officers, a documentary crew and his hosts. Every eye is upon him; this room is just another public stage. Hague asks for a private moment - to put on make-up for the television cameras - and we are all briefly expelled. Later, ready to make his speech, he pauses in the darkness by the side of the stage, looking out over ranks of middle-aged policemen settling down for the show. Hague at last seems to relax. He stands there, self-contained, peering into the middle distance, confident that he is again in his element, assured of his audience. Soon, these beer-gutted coppers with their bad ties and shiny suits will be chortling in their seats at the Tory leader's gags, applauding his attacks on crime, relishing the verbal boot going into Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw. It is a moment to ponder. Is this the next British Prime Minister? Can Hague win for the Tories this time, or even the next time? Will he be Prime Minister in 2001 or 2006? Or never? Can the Tory Boy Wonder destroy the might of New Labour? Or will the Great British nation always see him as that geeky man-child, prematurely old, 16 going on 45, dressed in an appalling adolescent tweed blazer giving that \"famous speech\" at the 1977 Tory party conference, an instantly retrievable icon in the national archive somewhere between the three-day week, power cuts and Mrs T in a polka-dot dress on the steps of 10 Downing Street. At the back of the hall, staring down impassive and unrelenting, are the electoral gods, the TV cameras, beaming out their message to the great beyond of low, high and middle England. The next general election is at least a year away, maybe two, but its outcome may be determined long before then; the winners, the losers, indelibly marked by the coming propaganda war of headlines. There is a short, expectant burst of applause, Hague moves forward into the light, and takes another step closer towards that final destination: Downing Street or defeat. The past month or so has seen the first glimmerings of hope for 39-year-old William Hague. After three years of political oblivion, the Tories are back in the game. For the first two years of New Labour, the Tories were a sad political joke. \"Jesus Christ himself could not have revived the fortunes of the Tory Party,\" quipped Steve Norris, the defeated Conservative London mayoral candidate. But the sheen of invincibility has come off New Labour. There are a hundred different explanations, but most centre on the hubris of Blair and the Downing Street machine. The Millennium Dome is a disaster, the Ken Livingstone fiasco has virtually destroyed the London Labour party, and Wales is only just recovering from Blair's destructive urge for rigging internal party elections. The economy might be strong and the government competent, but the days of passion for the New Labour project are gone; the party's membership is dropping through the floor. Suddenly, when Tone gets a few slow hand-claps at the WI, the newspapers are filled with talk of a political revolution. The mood music is changing. For a long time, Hague as Tory leader was a joke himself; a weirdo who grew up reading Hansard instead of comics and who would never be trusted by the electorate. When Hague spoke, no one listened; when he issued policy statements, no one cared. He was, it was believed, just keeping the seat warm for Michael Portillo to return and stab him in the back. But Hague has proved far more wily than his many enemies in the Tory party. Conservative Central Office has been purged, the Shadow Cabinet reshaped, and dissident heavyweights such as Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine marginalised. Cleverly, Hague has also neutralised Portillo by putting him in the front line against Chancellor Gordon Brown, who presides over Labour's greatest success, the economy. Portillo's lacklustre performances, his new-found self-doubt - fatal in a Conservative leader - have not gone unnoticed on the Tory backbenches. Hague's triumph over his leadership rivals is the triumph of instinct over calculation. \"I know a lot of people who have calculated everything in their life, every step of the way, and most of them are disappointed,\" he says. \"Most of them have not achieved the things they have wanted. Sometimes you have to roll the dice, to take the opportunity, even though it's fraught with difficulties and dangers.\" Hague has gone on the attack on Europe, on asylum seekers, on crime, on pensions, on school expulsions and, in the latest twist, on abortion and the death penalty. His slogan is the \"Commonsense Revolution\", but it is just the old Tory heartland agenda: bigger handcuffs, longer sentences, fewer foreigners, and tougher rules for the wrong sort of people. He is moving to the Right, moving back to where he came from, an instinctive child of Margaret Thatcher - though he is surprisingly unsentimental about her. Yes, he was upset when she was ousted by the party, but within hours you begin planning for the future, move one. Nevertheless, he has absorbed the message of her leadership. \"I turn out to be more successful at doing what I am doing when I am just myself. The more I have done it by instinct, by belief, by just being myself, the more successful I have become.\" Hague's traditional Tory promise to tax less but somehow spend more on public services such as health and education is, on a serious fiscal level, seriously unconvincing. But elections are not won or lost by a detailed perusal of Treasury estimates. Fear, prejudice, scare stories and a gut instinct for hitting the right political nerve, and leadership, were the decisive factors that created the succession of Conservative Party victories in the Thatcher era. It is clear that Hague plans to fight on the same battleground. \"The Tory Party is always at its strongest when it is practical and when representing an instinct,\" explains Hague, outlining the philosophical basis of his populist message. \"The attack of the Left on Thatcher used to be that she was ideological. But she was not ideological, she was very instinctive. The people were ready for this, and this was what had to be done for the country if it was not to become an economic backwater. The Conservative Party through the ages represents the instincts of the country. I have a good sense of what Labour voters think, as well as what Tory voters think. And I think the Labour Party is just beginning to realise that.\" Raising the temperature on asylum was probably key. Hague's language - \"bogus asylum seekers\", \"racketeers\", \"criminal gangs\" - bordered on incitement, but it played well down at the bowls club, and at the Daily Mail. \"Forget the reality,\" said one of his Labour opponents. \"Hague used the issue to redefine himself. The one thing a politician cannot afford is to be laughed at. It's much better to be thought of as frightening and nasty.\" Similarly, Hague's exploitation of the case of Tony Martin - the Norfolk farmer convicted of murder after shooting a burglar on his property - by calling, vaguely, for a reform of criminal legislation was a deft political stroke. \"Tony Martin was so successful not because there are lots of us who feel the need to shoot burglars,\" said a Conservative leader writer, \"but because it is the sort of view we would all probably endorse in a Surbiton pub: \u00a5Good on him'. It's the sort of view that politicians never endorse and we resent them for it. But here was a politician endorsing it and providing intellectual reasons to make us feel better about our own prejudices.\" Playing the race card, and banging the law-and-order drum, may be the quickest way in British politics to build up your enemies, but Hague's true passion is Europe. He himself coined the party's slogan - \"In Europe, not run by Europe\" - as a shorthand for his hostility to the onward march of the euro and further political union. Single-handedly, his personal anti-Europeanism, and Labour's nervousness about an election battle with the Tories over the pound, has stifled any real open political dialogue about the euro, and preserved sterling. Hague has no regrets: \"If I did not stand for keeping the pound, the whole body politic in Britain would have conspired against the public to join the euro. And that would have been the position of the Conservatives as well. It certainly happened in other European countries, where people had no choice. It may be true that three-quarters of all Germans did not want to join the euro, but nobody represented them.\" Hague's opposition to the euro, like his opposition to lots of things to do with change, is instinctual. \"Across the world, conservatives are people who believe in certain continuities and fixed loyalties. That's why conservatives tend to be people who believe in nation and family and pride - those things above ideologies - and oppose changes that would get rid of those things.\" But the philosophical plasticity of conservative \"instinct\" does allow William a get-out clause. \"We are not a party against change. We are a party against change for change's sake. Sometimes, we think its necessary to make radical economic or constitutional change to continue to have a free, prosperous society.\" \"You have got to realise that William is back where he wanted to be,\" said a Tory activist. \"For the past two years, the Conservative Party has been told it has to change to take account of the \u00a5New' Britain. William has decided that those advocating this change are our enemies, not our friends. They are people who will never be in favour of the Conservative Party or Britain.\" In the future, there will be no more baseball caps, and no talk about compassion. Hague's job description as Leader of the Opposition is not to help the Labour governance of Britain run smoothly. His role is to destroy it. If he fails, none of his policy pronouncements will matter. And if he wins, well, government is an entirely different state of affairs from promises made long ago in opposition. But, in order to win, Hague has to do his damnedest to destroy New Labour. \"William is aware of his strengths and his weaknesses,\" said his biographer Jo-Anne Nadler, whose book, William Hague: In His Own Right, will be published later this year. \"All the comments about his appearance, his voice, it does not personally bother him. He realises that people are not going to come round to him until they have started hating Blair. The sheen has to come off Tony Blair.\" It is not all media spin. Tony Blair, baby Leo aside, looks tired, weary. At Prime Minister's Question Time, Blair seems increasingly rattled, like a young barrister undergoing the ordeal of his first day in court. On his feet, Blair grips the dispatch box, digging the heels of his hands into the corner as if to distract himself from the pain of this, and his, performance. His body language is unmistakable: he hates and fears every second of this ritual. Feet away, across the floor, Hague almost lounges, waiting for the moment to strike. At Question Time, the chamber is packed, a noisy crowd gathered. The air is a hubbub of muttered insult, asides, shouts. Hague rises and his voice cuts the air, and he is off with some cleverly-rehearsed quip that usually draws shameful sniggers from the Labour backbenches. He is full of glee as he lashes again and again at his opponent. Blair flicks through his Civil Service briefing book to find the right answer. Sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't, but he never looks happy until Madam Speaker calls time. Even some of those who have reason to hate Hague's guts believe he is doing a good job at besting Blair. \"William is taking the fight to Labour,\" said John Redwood, who Hague sacked from the Shadow Cabinet. \"He is far more courageous and determined than most of his Shadow Cabinet colleagues. He is showing the way to oppose. He is not afraid to spark controversy.\" In the village that is Westminster, the conventional wisdom, up until now, says none of this matters; the British public doesn't care who scores the most debating points. The polls consistently show Labour leading the Conservatives by 10 or more points, and generally give Blair double the personal approval rating of Hague. But other conservative voices, his contemporaries as junior ministers, are less charitable than Redwood about Hague. \"He is creepy, and I think the British public will never elect him,\" said one. \"If he had married Ann Widdecombe, it really would be a marriage of true losers. I cannot remember one single memorable thing he has done in his life apart from that speech.\" In the past, Hague's failure to make a wider electoral impact has been blamed on his poor televisual skills. He has none of the telegenic intimacy that made Blair so convincing on the morning of Princess Diana's death. In contrast, Hague's performance that morning was as stilted as a dead tree. \"There is no question about it, William Hague does look odd on television,\" says Adam Boulton, Sky News's political editor. \"And his recent haircut has not improved it. He just never looks good or relaxed. He does not seem to think it's important. He is far more interested in platform speeches and House of Commons rhetoric.\" But then, no one in television in the past has ever treated Hague as a serious contender. It is only in the past few weeks that Hague has started to get the top radio and television news slots. There is one truism about television and politics that will work to his advantage: political figures who get on the telly tend to stay on the telly. Hague is clever, a robust political warrior, and his recent progress has certainly not slipped the attention of the current occupants of No10. \"To his credit, when things were tough, he toughed it out,\" said one insider. \"Hague had a terrible press, a lot of it unfair. He just kept going, and I admire that in a politician. He is tactically clever but strategically hopeless. The tax guarantee [Hague's stated commitment to lower the burden of taxes regardless of the state of the world economy in the next Parliament] will kill him. Every day we are clocking spending commitments by him or his Shadow ministers. He can come up with his little lines, but elections are won on the big issues and the big arguments. And, let's face it, this guy is a political obsessive. He did grow up reading Hansard, and there is something odd about that.\" Downing Street's arguments are not entirely convincing. Politics, particularly in the absence either of ideological division or committed, class-based electoral support, becomes a blur of vague focus-group perceptions, a half-remembered catalogue of events and electoral promises, likes and dislikes. Image is everything. New Labour itself came to power by a steady war of attrition on fatcats, Tory sleaze and one failed Back-to-Basics relaunch after another under a flailing John Major. Labour is still a long way from losing, but in recent months Hague indisputably has helped heighten some vague electoral unease. These things are intangible, nebulous, but all the more dangerous for being so. Blair should have returned from paternity leave in triumph - a new father, the proverbial successful, virile son-in-law you wished you had - but instead he walked straight into an open hunting season on the \"out-of-touch metropolitan liberal elite\". Within minutes of ending the Brighton speech, we are off to Scotland. At Glasgow airport, Hague passes through virtually unrecognised. Scotland has long ceased to be a Tory heartland; the party was wiped out in 1997 and has not one sitting MP. There are 72 Westminster seats in Scotland. Realistically, there are now just five Scottish constituencies where the party has any chance of regaining a seat. The Scottish Tories' best bet is Eastwood in the suburbs of Glasgow, whose 11,800 Conservative majority was reversed by a 15% swing into a 3,000 Labour majority at the last election. Hague has gone north to host a fund-raising dinner for the prospective candidate, Raymond Robertson, a former MP and now chairman of the party in Scotland. But our first stop is the television studios. Hague repeats the line about crime that he used in his Police Federation speech, attacking faddish New Labour and, by implication, all this new-fangled racial awareness nonsense. \"We need more PCs and less PC.\" He and his press secretary, Amanda Platell, want to keep focused on the law-and-order message. Like any politician, Hague's lines, however sincerely delivered, are carefully pre-scripted. At any one moment he can churn out 20 or maybe 30 little sound-bites on whatever issue the interviewer presses the button on. It is an essential tool of the politician's trade, and Hague has nearly mastered it to perfection. Each little line is important, not just for what it says, but for what it does not say. The best one, which we heard repeated, word perfect, half-a-dozen times over the following 24 hours, was on asylum seekers. \"We have chaos in the asylum system.

      "body": "<p>I always think of myself as fairly shameless, so when someone surprises me with their shamelessness I'm quite taken aback. It doesn't happen very often. In particular, I don't expect to have my thunder stolen by English tennis players, yet a news item last week had me pop-eyed with awe. The speaker was one \"Buster\" Mottram; the paper carrying his gems didn't say how old he was - or, craftily, print a photograph of him - but I remember his silly name from my teens, so he's got to be in his fifties. It's hardly a stellar name, is it: \"Mottram\"? Like something embarrassing you'd do in a car. And as for being called \"Buster\" once you've lost your milk teeth... </p> <p>Like most English tennis players over the past 30 years, his reputation is hardly glorious, either. In fact, all I remember him for is expressing support for the National Front and then attempting to cover his embarrassment by embarking on a song-writing career with the black entertainer, Kenny Lynch. I don't suppose you're currently tapping your toe to a snazzy little Mottram-Lynch number, or indeed have ever done, so I think it's fair to say that in this, as in his day job, \"Buster\" cut a less than Olympian figure. Never mind - he has now found a foolproof way to get into the papers: throughout Wimbledon, he has been available to the media to do exactly what you'd think a fifty-something man who still laboured under the name \"Buster\" would do best. Namely, tease the girls and make them cry. </p> <p>That's right - \"Buster\" has announced that he doesn't fancy Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles or Jennifer Capriati, because they're too fat. Furthermore, he warned from his throne on Mount Olympus, the women's game will soon start losing out financially (something he is an authority on, to be fair) if women players leave their femininity behind. \"In the 70s, women earned massive sponsorship from cosmetic companies, attracted by their femininity,\" he said. \"Today, sponsorship is drying up because women do not regard their femininity as an asset. I think Anna Kournikova is the best influence on the women's game in a long time.\" </p> <p>You don't have to be a rad fem to consider it weird that a player who gets knocked out in the first few days of Wimbledon is held up as the example to whom other women players should aspire. And, somehow, I can't imagine Davenport, Seles or Capriati crying in the dressing room and refusing to come out on court because Mottram doesn't fancy them. Well, that settles it: they must be lesbians then. Davenport (6ft 2in, 12 stone), Capriati (um, nine and a half stone) and Seles (no vital statistics available, but reported as being definitely \"chunky\"), by putting devotion to their craft over their appeal to men (Capriati, we were reminded by the Daily Mail, was a \"delicate figure in her early career\" and a regular pin-up), have committed one of the most heinous modern crimes a woman can: they do not care whether or not they are physically attractive. Whereas a woman might once have been disapproved of merely as sloppy, today her appearance calls into question her sexual orientation, morals and even sanity. I'm thinking here of the way the exquisitely beautiful Patsy Kensit is accused of being on the verge of mental collapse if she so much as steps outside her house without full stage make-up and a Versace frock. </p> <p>As Susan Faludi pointed out in Backlash, as women's assurance in the professional field has grown, so their confidence has been assaulted by a growing media obsession with their personal appearance. After all, as Simone de Beauvoir said, it takes an awful lot of time to become a \"real\" woman - time that must inevitably be snatched away from working, playing or relaxing. The hysterical over-use of the word \"pampering\" - which implies that this is a woman's \"Me\" time, whereas really it is simply more work on the raw material so as not to make it too repulsive to all-important men - is a symptom of this. So are famous and/or older women who neurotically strip off for inspection every chance they get; and the City bankers who waste their lunch-times having manicures (once the province of the kept woman and the idle housewife) when they could be having fun; and the idiot who brought the phrase \"Does my bum look big in this?\" into popular use. (Who would you rather sleep with/look like - Jennifer Lopez or Calista Flockhart?) </p> <p> Look at poor old Sporty Spice, accused of being a lesbian partly because she went on holiday with a woman, Ying Yau, whose name sounded like an Oriental orgasm, but mostly because she put on loads of weight and didn't seem to care; seemed really happy, in fact. The castration of Sporty, who can now be heard mewing, \"I'm going to have my hair long and blonde for the next video - it'll be magic!\", is an example of how easily young, not-too-smart girls can be cowed into submission by what Anna Ford so memorably dubbed body fascism. The Daily Mail has created thousands more anorexics than Vogue, because Vogue simply shows thin women while the Daily Mail keeps up a non-stop commentary on the weight gain of famous women and links it directly to their sexual orientation and career success. For a newspaper so opposed to the Nanny State, it certainly does a good imitation of a prize nag. </p> <p>And here is the heart of the matter. \"Nagging\" is popularly believed to be the province of women in our society - though, in my experience, the nagging, neurotically-houseproud husband is an ever-present danger as he strives to achieve in the domestic arena the order and dominance that he cannot achieve in the outside world. It is fair to say that, of the 72% of divorces that women petition for each year, a good number of them involve husbands who fussed, fretted and nagged themselves right out of a marriage. </p> <p>On a far greater level, to be a woman today is to be subjected to a barrage of nagging from cradle to grave, much of it about morals, conduct and health, but mostly on the way one looks, and almost all of it from men such as Buster Mottram. How does this happen? Is there some sort of NHS scheme whereby kind nurses creep into the homes of the likes of David Baddiel and Frank Skinner at night and replace their real mirrors with trick mirrors that reflect them as resembling Josh Hartnett and Heath Ledger? If not, how would they dare nag at women for not being up to sexual scratch? </p> <p>If a man is married to a nagging wife, he can kill her, get a pat on the head from the judge and be out on the streets in time for the next Rotary dinner. If a woman finds herself stuck in a nagging nation state, though, what is her option?</p>",

When we got home, we had a huge row and she's sleeping in the spare room.\" \"Alice... are you saying you can't have me to stay?\" \"I'm sorry, Dulcie, but... no.\" Ring off determined to say no to this no. This is just small stuff, and I'm not going to sweat it. I'm going to London come what may. There are cheap hotels in Bloomsbury. Dive into my rucksack, blow treacherous kisses to incredulous family and walk off briskly towards the station. No guilt, no sweat and, as I discover on arrival at the booking office, no purse.",

      "body": "<p>Charlotte Hindle and Simon Ritchie's south-London home is nothing much to look at from the outside. One of a row of family houses in a low-rise, inner-city estate, built in 1966 (the year of white PVC and World Cup euphoria), it's an unremarkable example of utilitarian, public-sector architecture. And, despite years of private ownership, it still has \"council\" written all over its dull, red-brick facade. </p> <p>You get a similar, dull feeling from the exterior of the home of Chris Fletcher and his wife Susan Shaw - a mundane, purpose-built flat dating from Edwardian times. Inside, the comparisons do not stop, but for entirely different reasons. Both couples have transformed the dysfunctional parts of their interiors using ultra-modern design so, judging from the outside, you would not think you were in the same home. </p> <p>But while Fletcher and Shaw wanted to change their hated, cramped kitchen and the \"flimsy\" trap-door that hid a staircase leading to the back yard, Hindle and Ritchie had more ambitious plans. </p> <p>According to Hindle, the interior of their house used to be \"very councilly\", just like the outside. Now, behind the front door, is a clean, white, open-plan space, highlighted with bold slabs of bright paintwork; nice wooden floors; clever lighting; a groovy kitchen with lacquered units in strong colours (inspired by the lavender fields of Provence) and a collage of unusual linear tiles (after the London Underground). </p> <p>An oblique travel theme reflects the occupants' jobs (Charlotte is a manager at publisher Lonely Planet; husband Simon is a travel writer). But this is no Changing Rooms make-over. More structural engineering than cosmetic surgery, it's been a case of changing the dynamics of the space, rather than dressing it up in new clothes. It's not a DIY job, either - in fact, the couple were terribly grown-up and hired an architect. </p> <p>The architect, Robert Loader, wasn't cheap, of course. \"We budgeted for \u00a350,000 but ended up spending \u00a360,000,\" says Hindle. But, for the majority of architects, that is cheap (as a rough guide, their fee works out at between 8% and 15% of the total contract value; any job worth less than \u00a330,000 is small-practice chicken-feed). And, for Hindle and Ritchie, it was a great deal cheaper than the alternative - buying an \"airier, spacier\" house in the same area of inner London. \"We considered that option, but couldn't find anything for much less than \u00a3300,000,\" says Charlotte. </p> <p>Their ex-council house, in its raw, unlovely state, was not worth that kind of money. So, they decided to invest in what their architect describes as a process of \"renewal\". And the result is an inspiration for all those aspiring modernists who despair of ever affording a contemporary living space. If you don't have the wile or the wherewithal to buy, or build, something new and exciting, then here's the solution: buy something old and tired, and then remodel, extend and, indeed, renew. </p> <p>Do you need to hire an architect? Absolutely, says Hindle. And the quality of the design is only part of that necessity. \"We didn't have time to come up with plans, or to keep track of builders, or to do any of the project management, so we needed somebody to do all of that for us,\" she explains. \"Plus, our architect came up with ideas we'd never have thought of, he sourced products we wouldn't know where to find, he even helped with the colour scheme.\" </p> <p>This, in essence, is what architects do. In fact, the notion that they are all shoving up landmark schemes on the scale of the Lloyds building is a misunderstanding. More often than not, they are reconfigurating existing material rather than building from scratch (only one in four of the private housing projects that made it on to the RIBA awards list for this year are new-build schemes). Hence, the majority of architectural practice is simply a case of adding or subtracting walls - albeit in a manner that expresses their own distinctive style. </p> <p>While Robert Loader has particular sympathy for 60s and 70s buildings (\"much more interesting than poxy Victorian terraces,\" he says), the architect used by Chris Fletcher and Susan Shaw specialises in \"introducing very modern insertions to listed buildings\". Deborah Saunt is a partner at the London practice of DSDHA, which has just won a RIBA award for an Orangery extension in Norfolk. With its contract value of \u00a330,000, this was one of the smallest winning projects. Fletcher's and Shaw's flat, in Dulwich, south London, was an even smaller job. </p> <p>Fletcher, a museum curator, and Shaw, a doctor, were perfectly happy with the majority of their home (with its unusually large and splendidly original reception rooms), but the cramped kitchen was \"dreadful\". The cabinet doors hung off their hinges, the sink didn't work, the hole in the floor was blocked by a washing machine. And not only was it a \"dark, pokey, unappealing space\", but it was one of the first sights to greet guests when they walked in. \"Neither of us had any ideas or solutions,\" says Fletcher. \"And although we knew we needed proper advice, it was a revelation to discover that we could use an architect for such a small job.\" </p> <p>The basis of Deborah Saunt's brief was to make one \"simple clean space\" out of two awkward ones (kitchen and dining room) and to rethink the trap-door exit. In general, her approach is, she says, a case of \"finding a long-term solution that is flexible enough to accommodate change\". And, in this one, she compensated for the limitations of a low budget - around \u00a320,000 - by investing in rich, tactile materials (such as adding American oak surfaces to the MDF kitchen units) and small but clever touches in the detailing (like nifty door handles). </p> <p>As well as opening up the space, she built a storage wall to hide kitchen utilities, designed an island kitchen unit (complete with a lift-up ledge to conceal the cooking mess that Chris likes to make and Susan hates to see); she hid a \"stranded boiler\" in the dining room behind a neat enclosure and, finally, created a new, more accessible door to the once-horrible rear exit in the form of lift-up flaps, which blend beautifully with the floor when not in use. </p> <p>According to Fletcher, the trapdoor has since become semi-redundant (\"I actually find it more convenient just to use the front door and walk round the back,\" he admits), but he and Shaw are delighted with the overall scheme. \"I think we saved money in the long run,\" says Fletcher. And, since they are thinking of selling the flat, the improvements will almost certainly enhance its value. </p> <p>This wouldn't apply, however, in areas of Britain where you can still buy a whole house for roughly the same price as Deborah Saunt's low-budget bill. Four years ago, the architect Doug Chadwick (of Chadwick &amp; Bracewell) and his daughter Delphine (also an architect) bought such a place, in Blackburn for \u00a314,500. True, it was a wreck (damp walls, dodgy roof, dismal interior), but that was all part of the masterplan - part of Doug's \"30-year crusade to bring contemporary design to East Lancashire\". </p> <p>The two-up-two-down house was essentially for Delphine, who was still studying at the time and not only wanted a cheap home but, according to her father, also needed \"a little bit of hands-on experience in the practicalities of construction\". For Doug, meanwhile, the property provided his own little experiment in small-scale urban regeneration - a model that would, hopefully, inspire others to do extraordinary things with Lancashire's plentiful supply of ordinary houses (\"people in this area are not very interested in modern design,\" he says). </p> <p>They went for a south-facing property in a single-row terrace overlooking a playing field, in an area of Blackburn known as Cherry Tree. Between them, father and daughter gutted the place, removing walls, doors and a section of the first floor ceiling so that the old landing is now open-plan to a former bedroom (which became a study) and the stairwell is now open to the apex of the roof (which now features a line of Velux windows). They also created storage areas either side of what used to be the attic space, and suspended a bridge between the two. </p> <p>According to Doug, the total cost was only \u00a330,000, which covered the cost of the house, the refurbishment and every little detail, from the beech floors to the Venetian blinds. The figure, however, doesn't allow for much of the labour costs and design fees (supplied by the Chadwicks). But even though the house is now worth around \u00a349,000, Doug insists that capital gain is less important than design objectives, or \"enhancing the drama of the space\". </p> <p>The main objective, he says, was to bring sunshine into the property's dark, north-facing rear end - \"to warm it up with daylight and give it more life,\" says Doug - and to increase its \"accommodation capability\" (getting rid of circulation space added 15% to living space). And although internally almost nothing original survives, the character of the building is unchanged. Thus, a modern, minimalist home has, once again, been slipped unobtrusively into an old shell. </p> <p>Although the economics bear no comparison, the objectives are similar to those encountered during Robert Loader's 60s council-house renewal. There, too, the clients wanted to bring light into the back of a house, rid themselves of superfluous enclosures and free up unused space. \"The rooms were small and claustrophobic, and the house felt very suburban and old-fashioned,\" says Charlotte. \"The windows at the back didn't let in much light. And we didn't have a dining area. Having friends round for dinner is part of our lifestyle, so not having a dining area mattered to us.\" </p> <p>Aside from the Proven\u00e7al kitchen, the living space now has full-height windows overlooking the garden; the dining table sits in place of a redundant utility room; and air flows freely between one space and another. </p> <p>The architect's bill included everything - design fees, builder's fees, kitchen units, tiles, flooring. \"He took a very holistic approach,\" says Hindle. \"He even helped us design the furniture. But I suppose, that's what good architects do. Instead of asking for a brief, they talk to you about your life and then they design the house around you.\" </p> <p>So if the house you have no longer suits your life, then think about it: you might not even have to move </p> <p>\u0095 For information about hiring an architect, contact the Royal Institute of British Architects Client Advisory Line on 020-7307 3700.</p>",

According to Doug, the total cost was only \u00a330,000, which covered the cost of the house, the refurbishment and every little detail, from the beech floors to the Venetian blinds. The figure, however, doesn't allow for much of the labour costs and design fees (supplied by the Chadwicks). But even though the house is now worth around \u00a349,000, Doug insists that capital gain is less important than design objectives, or \"enhancing the drama of the space\". The main objective, he says, was to bring sunshine into the property's dark, north-facing rear end - \"to warm it up with daylight and give it more life,\" says Doug - and to increase its \"accommodation capability\" (getting rid of circulation space added 15% to living space). And although internally almost nothing original survives, the character of the building is unchanged. Thus, a modern, minimalist home has, once again, been slipped unobtrusively into an old shell. Although the economics bear no comparison, the objectives are similar to those encountered during Robert Loader's 60s council-house renewal. There, too, the clients wanted to bring light into the back of a house, rid themselves of superfluous enclosures and free up unused space. \"The rooms were small and claustrophobic, and the house felt very suburban and old-fashioned,\" says Charlotte. \"The windows at the back didn't let in much light. And we didn't have a dining area. Having friends round for dinner is part of our lifestyle, so not having a dining area mattered to us.\" Aside from the Proven\u00e7al kitchen, the living space now has full-height windows overlooking the garden; the dining table sits in place of a redundant utility room; and air flows freely between one space and another. The architect's bill included everything - design fees, builder's fees, kitchen units, tiles, flooring. \"He took a very holistic approach,\" says Hindle. \"He even helped us design the furniture. But I suppose, that's what good architects do. Instead of asking for a brief, they talk to you about your life and then they design the house around you.\" So if the house you have no longer suits your life, then think about it: you might not even have to move \u0095 For information about hiring an architect, contact the Royal Institute of British Architects Client Advisory Line on 020-7307 3700.",

      "body": "<p>On my first visit to an Oddbins shop, the year the England football team was managed by a bald man in a macintosh, I paid 24 shillings for three half-bottles of Ch\u00e2teau Smith-Haut-Lafite 1933. I wasted my money, and didn't get any of it back (one bottle oxidised, one bottle corked, one bottle boring). Oddbins has come on a lot since then, and so has the Languedoc, from where come the majority of the 14 Oddbins red wines that follow. </p> <p>Ch\u00e2teau de Valcombe Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes 1998 (17 points out of 20, \u00a35.49) has cheroots, hedgerows, leather, smoke, tannins, plus hints of old wood and les garrigues - enough of an assault course for anyone. Ch\u00e2teau de Valcombe Prestige Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.49) has a touch less drama than the cheaper wine from this property, and is slightly less gripping, though still a lovely wine. Ch\u00e2teau Grand Escalion Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes 1998 (17 points, \u00a35.99) I found difficult to tell apart from the \u00a35.49 Ch\u00e2teau de Valcombe. Perhaps the greatest differentiating subtlety is with the texture and the level of fumes. </p> <p>Domaine Borie de Maurel Belle de Nuit Minervois 1999 (17.5 points, \u00a37.49) is an extravagant mouthful, spreading itself lavishly on the tastebuds and refusing to budge. A bottle might last a week, so lingering is the richly complex, stunningly tannic fruit. Domaine Borie de Maurel Cuv\u00e9e Sylla Minervois 1998 (18 points, \u00a312.99) is even more grandiose, with its intensely savoury, deep, granite-jawed tannins and involved, swirling fruit of layered richness and texture. A truly exciting masterwork of such potency that it has to be compared with great claret costing four times more (a comparison odious in the extreme, but then this is an extreme wine). </p> <p>Domaine Borie de Maurel Esprit d'Automne Minervois 1999 (17 points, \u00a35.99) has a lush edge to its cigar-tangy fruit. It's very ripe and ready, and the tannins are the civilised side of intimidating. </p> <p>Enclave des Papes Cuv\u00e9e Sp\u00e9ciale C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.69) has wonderfully smooth and unruffled fruit with a hint of spiced plum and tobacco. More than a bit of a snip at this price, it's a great wine for back-garden get-togethers. James Herrick Millia Passum Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a36.99) has brilliant dark, dusky fruit of concentrated cassis and crunchy tannins. (This wine is possibly at Safeway, too, but no one could return my office's phone call to confirm this.) </p> <p>Le Grand Verdier Minervois 1998 (17 points, \u00a35.99) has tannins that grip, fruit that thrills, texture that excites - real class on show here. Pavillion de l'Escalion Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) has warmth and herby richness, allied to sensational tannins, which are soft yet insistent. And Plan Macassan Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.49) is a brilliant wine to take to the BYO restaurant because it can't be affected by cork taint and ruin your evening. The fruit under its plastic cork is all-action and feisty, and may prove seductive in the right candlelight. </p> <p>From Portugal, Oddbins has dug up Quinta das Setencostas Alenquer 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a35.49), which has warmth of disposition, weight of personality and panache of fruit. An exciting wine for the money. Scaranto Colli Euganei 1997 (16 points, \u00a36.49), from Italy, is also warm and generous, with a hint of plum/raspberry jam to the rich fruit and a softish finish. And from Australia there is Wirra Wirra Church Block Cabernet Shiraz Merlot 1998 (17 points, \u00a38.99), which is a benchmark blend, parading brisk tannins that elegantly coat the chocolate and cassis fruit. Waitrose has this wine, too, for the same money. </p> <p>Last, we must pop into Somerfield for some barbecue bargains. This retailer has four cheapies currently on offer until July 18. They are a decently earthy and rustic Vin de Pays d'Ardeche Red (14 points, \u00a32.29), a pleasant lemon/ melon Vin de Pays d'Ardeche White (14.5 points, \u00a32.75), a blackberryish Bulgarian Country Red (14 points, \u00a32.49), and a truly delicious Argentine, Santa Julia Syrah Ros\u00e9 (15 points, \u00a33.29). No hugely complex claims can be made for these wines, but with flamb\u00e9ed bangers or burnt mackerel they do more than merely drown your sorrows.</p>",

But they are all classics in the best sense of the word. I've always loved going to the stores and seeing the ordered ranks of tins and bottles and bags and boxes of ingredients that are just as much the backbone of the professional kitchen as they are of the domestic.

      "bodyText": "Here is a tale of three sauces. None of them is made by fancy-pants chefs. None has much of a place in haute cuisine or any of that nonsense. But they are all classics in the best sense of the word. I've always loved going to the stores and seeing the ordered ranks of tins and bottles and bags and boxes of ingredients that are just as much the backbone of the professional kitchen as they are of the domestic. Here are the different oils and essences, vinegars and pulses, herbs and spices with quality and pedigree. And here, too, between the tins of anchovies and tubs of mustard on the shelf below, are the bottles that you almost don't notice because they blend so much into daily life. They are the unmistakable bottles of Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce (not to mention Heinz tomato ketchup), stalwarts of the pantry and friends indeed when the soup has no ping, the sauce has no wow and a dish is as flat as a punctured tyre. Their unique abilities to quicken and enliven the foods upon which they are boldly splashed really are as brilliant as the legends that surround the origins of these potent kitchen comrades. The seeds of the original peppers for Tabasco came, around 150 years ago, to Edmund McIlhenny through a friend who had been fighting in the Mexican civil war. On receiving them, he sowed the seeds on Avery Island, Louisiana, but before they could be harvested he and his family had to flee during the upheavals of the war. On their return, McIlhenny discovered that the peppers had grown apace, a credit, possibly, to the mountain of salt below the soil, the peak of which is Avery Island. The rest, as they say, is history, the peppers having a unique and splendid flavour that eventually became the sauce that graces eating and drinking establishments around the globe. The story of Worcestershire sauce is less dramatic. In fact, it's all rather British. It seems that, back in the 1830s, a certain peer returned from India with a recipe involving vinegar, soy, molasses, anchovies, chilli, garlic, ginger, shallots and various fruits for a sauce, which he gave to two chemists by the name of Lea and Perrins to make up for him. So foul was the result - well, it would be, wouldn't it? - that the batch was left in the cellar, dismissed. A few years later, a big cleaning and sort-out was done to the cellar, and the barrel was heading for the bin when it was tasted - and, lo, one of the most famous sauces in the world came into creation. There are the obvious modes of using these condiments (a word I am none too keen on): Tabasco and oysters, Worcestershire sauce and roes on toast, for example; while a bowl of crisp, golden chips - hand-made, naturally - served with a bottle of ketchup is a far superior eat-me to a drab bit of pastry wrapped around some dull shredded vegetables accompanied by a spineless dip. But they play their part in many other dishes, too. Where, say, would the prawn cocktail be without a dash of Tabasco? I have little room in my heart for the prawn cocktail (I made so many of the damned things in my youth), but thinking about them again stirred my memory, and the recollection of avocado stuffed with prawns seemed measurably better.

      "body": "<p>I ring my publisher from a phonebox outside a bookshop. I think it was Boots The Bookshop, or was it Books EG. Anyway, I was behaving with the crushed childishness of a newly-published writer and complaining that my book, out only a matter of days, was not stocked in this large bookshop. As far as I could tell, it seemed to stock every new release except mine. I admit that my book doesn't feature anyone called Harry - or Tom or Dick or, indeed, Jamie - but then, not all books do. Not yet, anyway.</p> <p>Julian, the target of my frustration, managed somehow, with publisher's guile, to hold my hand down the phone and stroke my anguished brow. He suggested that I wear the special invisible pair of glasses he had supplied me with for such an occasion, and swallow the tablets he had given me. Go back into the shop, he gently said, massaging my shoulders and pouring me a Martini, and look again. With newly-published-author obedience, I looked again.

Anyway, I was behaving with the crushed childishness of a newly-published writer and complaining that my book, out only a matter of days, was not stocked in this large bookshop. As far as I could tell, it seemed to stock every new release except mine. I admit that my book doesn't feature anyone called Harry - or Tom or Dick or, indeed, Jamie - but then, not all books do. Not yet, anyway. Julian, the target of my frustration, managed somehow, with publisher's guile, to hold my hand down the phone and stroke my anguished brow. He suggested that I wear the special invisible pair of glasses he had supplied me with for such an occasion, and swallow the tablets he had given me. Go back into the shop, he gently said, massaging my shoulders and pouring me a Martini, and look again. With newly-published-author obedience, I looked again.

So I agreed.\" </p> <p>Agreeing to a secondment is one thing, adopting a positive attitude to it - particularly if, like Barker, you're not keen in the first place - is something very different. All too often secondments are not a particularly enticing prospect - months spent staying in a hotel, working with people you don't know, away from friends and family, all so that you can come back after six months and feel totally out of place in your own company. </p> <p>\"If you view a secondment in those kind of terms you might as well not go,\" believes Averil Leimon, director of Plus Consulting. \"It's fairly essential to adopt a positive attitude and look for the benefits that six months in a new company and a new area will give you. Although being away from your friends and your office might seem intimidating or an effort, it is a chance to meet different people, to observe different working practices and broaden your experience.\" </p> <p>Three months after returning from Bangor, Barker admits that the secondment has had some benefits. \"I can't honestly say that I enjoyed my time there, but it was positive in that I'm much more confident in myself,\" he says. \"Suddenly I was with a group of people I didn't know, and they were the only people to spend time with in the evening. </p> <p>\"After a few weeks we all became quite close - and it meant we worked far more productively.

Check up the train times and see if you can leave slightly early on Friday afternoon - or if you can't travel home, make plans for friends to come and see you.\" </p> <p>For assistant TV producer Serena Macintosh, it wasn't until three months into her secondment to Manchester from Southampton that she realised how unhappy she was. \"I'd accepted a six month secondment - I wasn't overly keen to go, but I arranged to come home each weekend and tried to learn everything that I could.

I know it sounds stupid, but I really started to feel as if I wasn't going to have a job to come back to.\" </p> <p>Things came to a head three months into the secondment, when Macintosh was told by her boss that they wanted to extend her time to nine months. \"I simply burst into tears,\" she says. \"I felt as if it was proof that they weren't interested in having me back. My boss was really understanding and took me for a drink and it all came out - how lonely I felt, how isolated, how I felt that instead of increasing my standing in the company I was just being forgotten about.\" </p> <p>\"It's incredibly important to maintain regular links with your own company whilst on secondment,\" says Imogen Daniels, adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development. \"Attending a team meeting or briefing every couple of weeks means you can update people on what you are working on - and also catch up on what's been happening at their end. Its hugely important to feel confident about slotting back into the company at the end of a secondment - if you are feeling anxious then talk to the person who is running the secondment and explain your fears.\" </p> <p>For Macintosh the secondment ended up being an extremely positive experience - two months after she returned, she was promoted. \"Looking back I did get in a state,\" she admits, \"when all I needed to do was talk to someone to straighten things out. </p> <p>\"From my experience I would say it's imperative to be honest about how it's going and make sure there is someone in your old office to talk things through with.

The screen becomes the only means of communication, and the user interface performs life-like functions. Outside the IT industry itself, this dream has not yet come true. But over the next couple of years, graduate recruitment may become the first non-specialist area of human activity to be fully digitalised. </p> <p>This coming revolution relies on three simple factors. Students are more e-literate than other adults; they're all looking for jobs; and the most successful companies have to attract and identify the best people in order to succeed in the future. </p> <p>These three factors are combining to force graduate recruiters on to the web, and, once there, to push them towards exclusive use of online application (because PCs can interact where paper can't, making selection much more efficient). </p> <p>The first part of this process is almost complete. Nearly two-thirds of companies recruiting graduates now accept online applications alongside paper forms. </p> <p>For students, this initial transition has created a few minor problems, and some unforeseen benefits. </p> <p>The few problems associated with e-applications lie in the nature of the medium. Email is fast and informal, qualities not normally associated with the filling out of application forms. </p> <p>Recruiters report that students can easily slip into the sort of email habits which do not impress. These include rambling (because space is often not limited in the way it is on a conventional form) and frequent occurrences of the original bugs in the system: spelling and grammar. </p> <p>Many online application forms do not have grammar or spell checks, and this is a calculated act of unhelpfulness.

The screen becomes the only means of communication, and the user interface performs life-like functions. Outside the IT industry itself, this dream has not yet come true. But over the next couple of years, graduate recruitment may become the first non-specialist area of human activity to be fully digitalised. This coming revolution relies on three simple factors. Students are more e-literate than other adults; they're all looking for jobs; and the most successful companies have to attract and identify the best people in order to succeed in the future. These three factors are combining to force graduate recruiters on to the web, and, once there, to push them towards exclusive use of online application (because PCs can interact where paper can't, making selection much more efficient). The first part of this process is almost complete. Nearly two-thirds of companies recruiting graduates now accept online applications alongside paper forms. For students, this initial transition has created a few minor problems, and some unforeseen benefits. The few problems associated with e-applications lie in the nature of the medium. Email is fast and informal, qualities not normally associated with the filling out of application forms. Recruiters report that students can easily slip into the sort of email habits which do not impress. These include rambling (because space is often not limited in the way it is on a conventional form) and frequent occurrences of the original bugs in the system: spelling and grammar. Many online application forms do not have grammar or spell checks, and this is a calculated act of unhelpfulness. Employers want to know one of two things. Can you spell, and if you can't, are you professional enough to get it checked? Printing off a copy before sending it is essential not only for proofreading purposes, but also because it lets applicants look back at what they have said if they are called for interview. The unforeseen benefit of web-based recruitment lies in the fact that the newness of the medium encourages students to make new kinds of judgements about their potential employers. Brochures may have been highly branded, but there was little information to be gleaned from the way the information was accessed, presented and managed. Websites, because they are interactive, tell you far more about how a company views itself and its potential employees. Judgements that can be made about websites include the technical (are you downloading forms and software or accessing it directly on the company server?), ease of use (does it take long to download and is the layout, structure and menu clear?), the communicative (can you follow the progress of your application?), convenience (can you save and return, and does it all take less than an hour?), as well as a whole range of branding judgements.
