According to companies leading the way in the booming online football diary business - we want to know - so much so that one of them, last week, offered David Beckham a \u00a31m advance for exclusive online access to his mind. </p> <p>In the last fortnight, hosts of existing UK diaries - Sportsnetglobal, Sportingidols and Icons (about to merge with the industry's aging Norwegian fore-runner, Sportprofile) - offered readers a varied diet. While David Ginola, Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit all used their diaries to announce multi-million pound transfers, young Alan Smith was penning a piece on his Leeds heritage, Erik Meijer revealed 'I have two bottles of alcohol in my room' and Lars Bohinen provided this insight into his leisure time: 'We've just had a well-deserved weekend off, during which I watched Formula One. It would appear to be quite popular to slam into Schumacher's rear end.' </p> <p>All of which is fine - as far as it goes.

'The problem with the diary industry is there's very big money behind very little content.' </p> <p>Those backing the projects disagree. On one level, newsworthiness is readily manufactured. Sander Westerveld, Robbie Fowler and Alfe Inge Haaland have all provoked sensational press stories with indiscreet comments ('Damn this talk of fines!' wrote Haaland after his diary entry on the use of the words 'scum' and 'shit' in football provoked Leeds to take disciplinary action).

But most players aren't like that. They are hugely enthusiastic about being able to take control of their image and talk directly, without the distortion or spin of the media. One hour after the Holland v Italy match in June, Frank de Boer was on the phone to us pouring his heart out.

'In terms on content, the diaries are really only chapter one of what we plan to offer. Commercially, this can be massive.' </p> <p>Japanese sites, rather longer established, have set up subscription diaries. Each of Hidetoshi Nakata's millions of followers pays $4.67 a month for access to his online diary ('It's a way for Nakata to show his gratitude to his fans,' suggests business manager Fujita Mina). But European fans, operators acknowledge, want to receive something more tangible for their money. Icons have begun auctioning shirts - Dennis Bergkamp's Euro 2000 top went for \u00a34000 - while Sportingidols, established by agent Jon Smith, has a com plex business plan. 'Players' existing sponsorship deals will take on a global dimension,' says Smith, 'opening up into, for instance, the lucrative Malaysian and Singaporean markets. Alongside this, we'll be merchandising, list-broking, content exporting, and looking at ISP and Wap provision - there's quite a lot planned.' </p> <p>But will the diaries be a strong enough foundation to keep the surfers coming? </p> <p>'That's the plan,' says Smith. 'The key principle of our site is that the players are the biggest shareholders. So in the simplest terms, the more interesting their diaries, the more they will earn. At the start it is likely to be tens of thousands - but in the longer term they could make huge sums.' </p> <p>Icons, Sportingidols and Sportsnetglobal - the big players - will go head to head later this year. The latter have begun taking on other top sportsmen - Brian Lara, Peter Scudamore and Johnny Herbert - to expand the genre, while sportingidols is relying on sheer weight of numbers: they hope to have 40 per cent of Premiership and Nationwide players in the bag by the end of the year. </p> <p>But is the world ready to peer into hundreds of footballers lives - including, mouth- wateringly, Alan Shearer's? </p> <p>'We're used to scepticism,' says Freedman.

Gerard Houllier's Liverpool do not seem to be able to start a season in strong striking shape. </p> <p>Indeed, in pre-season they have picked up a collection of injuries to concern them and leave them in almost as wobbly a condition as the Anfield Road stand that will today be closed - for a friendly against Parma until building inspection work is complete that could enable them to re-open it for next Saturday's kick-off against Bradford City. </p> <p>Fowler missed most of last season, after a promising start, only once starting in tandem with Owen. The injury sustained in a pre-season friendly against Glentoran means that it is likely to be between four and six weeks before the two team up again. 'Robbie was unfortunate. For half an hour against Glentoran he was sharp,' says Houllier. 'It needs to be sorted out because this is a major talent.' </p> <p>Houllier appears more concerned in the short-term, though, by a series of niggling leg muscle injuries to Steven Gerrard, to whom both club and country are looking to develop as a dynamo in midfield. 'It is a worry, yes. He was injured after only one half for England this summer so we have to look at the situation with him.

      "bodyText": "This time last year, the problem was Michael Owen's hamstrings. Now it is Robbie Fowler's ankle. Gerard Houllier's Liverpool do not seem to be able to start a season in strong striking shape. Indeed, in pre-season they have picked up a collection of injuries to concern them and leave them in almost as wobbly a condition as the Anfield Road stand that will today be closed - for a friendly against Parma until building inspection work is complete that could enable them to re-open it for next Saturday's kick-off against Bradford City. Fowler missed most of last season, after a promising start, only once starting in tandem with Owen. The injury sustained in a pre-season friendly against Glentoran means that it is likely to be between four and six weeks before the two team up again. 'Robbie was unfortunate. For half an hour against Glentoran he was sharp,' says Houllier. 'It needs to be sorted out because this is a major talent.' Houllier appears more concerned in the short-term, though, by a series of niggling leg muscle injuries to Steven Gerrard, to whom both club and country are looking to develop as a dynamo in midfield. 'It is a worry, yes. He was injured after only one half for England this summer so we have to look at the situation with him. I hope that - medically speaking - it will be sorted out.' Houllier has already resigned himself to losing Jamie Redknapp as his captain - Sami Hyppia the replacement - for at least half of the season due to his rehabilitation from knee surgery. 'That's one of the reasons I signed Gary McAllister,' he said. 'He has a great attitude and is a great example to other players. He has a brain.'

A large and talented squad with around \u00a310m worth of new signings, a shrewd manager who knows the First Division's quirks, and an understanding chairman. Add a large slice of luck and you have the perfect formula for promotion. </p> <p>It may sound straightforward, but of course it isn't, as countless clubs and managers have discovered over the years. When I previously became manager of Crystal Palace, back in 1993, we were fortunate enough to win the First Division championship in my first season - and by some margin. We had been relegated the year before, but kept the nucleus of that team together. There were some excellent young players such as Nigel Martyn, Gareth Southgate, Chris Coleman, Richard Shaw and Chris Armstrong, who have all gone on to bigger and better things. Martyn was an exceptional goalkeeper and his performances won a lot of points for us. We had tremendous pace throughout the side and strength in depth, which is absolutely vital with 46 league games in a physically demanding division. </p> <p>Any teams aiming to go up this year, and I would include Palace, now that I am back in charge, should be looking at Charlton and Ipswich as role models. </p> <p>Both clubs have stability off the field, which helps the manager get on with assembling a good squad. Neither club has the resources of, say, Blackburn or Fulham, but a combination of shrewd management and good housekeeping helped them win promotion. </p> <p>Their directors were also long-sighted enough to stand by their managers when they were relegated. George Burley at Ipswich and Charlton's Alan Curbishley both know the division inside out, which is another important factor. </p> <p>The First Division has some peculiar quirks, which means that if you are to get out of it, you need to know how to get a result at the likes of Grimsby and Stockport as well as beating bigger teams such as Blackburn and Wolves. Joe Royle is another manager who knows what it is all about, and he has been successful at Manchester City because he is probably the first manager in a long time to understand how boardroom politics work. </p> <p>I was talking to him earlier this week and he admitted that the team that won promotion is not good enough to survive in the Premiership, which is why he has brought in some big name signings such as George Weah and Paulo Wanchope. It is hard to cast aside players who have been so good for you the previous season, but as a manager you have to be ruthless at times. </p> <p>I think to survive in the Premiership, you need to bring in a minimum of three players and maximum of five players. Any more than that and you could ruin team spirit. My biggest problem when I took Palace up in 1994 was that my relationship with Ron Noades, the chairman at the time, was already breaking down. He thought he could do my job and I thought I could do his, quite honestly. </p> <p>I knew we needed to add to the squad but Ron told me to get on with the players I had. It was a big mistake and I told him so, and by the time we managed to bring in players of the quality of Ray Houghton, towards the end of that season, we were on the way down. </p> <p>That is why I would suggest you must spend another \u00a310m or so to get the number and quality of players you need to step up a level. City and Charlton have spent that sort of money but Ipswich have not, which is why I fear for them. </p> <p>It also helps to have financial muscle if you are to win promotion in the first place, which is why Blackburn and Fulham are favourites to go up. Around \u00a325m has been spent by First Division clubs this summer and there is bound to be more as the season progresses. </p> <p>This time last season I suggested that any three of 13 teams could go up, and it is not very different this year. The division is so even in terms of quality, and almost every manager is a well-known name. People such as Graham Taylor, David Platt, Trevor Francis, Dave Bassett and Graeme Souness, for example. </p> <p>Early season form is probably more of an indicator in this division than in the Premiership. Hopefully we will be among the contenders, but it will as hard as I can remember in the First Division.</p>",

Both clubs have stability off the field, which helps the manager get on with assembling a good squad. Neither club has the resources of, say, Blackburn or Fulham, but a combination of shrewd management and good housekeeping helped them win promotion. Their directors were also long-sighted enough to stand by their managers when they were relegated. George Burley at Ipswich and Charlton's Alan Curbishley both know the division inside out, which is another important factor. The First Division has some peculiar quirks, which means that if you are to get out of it, you need to know how to get a result at the likes of Grimsby and Stockport as well as beating bigger teams such as Blackburn and Wolves. Joe Royle is another manager who knows what it is all about, and he has been successful at Manchester City because he is probably the first manager in a long time to understand how boardroom politics work. I was talking to him earlier this week and he admitted that the team that won promotion is not good enough to survive in the Premiership, which is why he has brought in some big name signings such as George Weah and Paulo Wanchope. It is hard to cast aside players who have been so good for you the previous season, but as a manager you have to be ruthless at times. I think to survive in the Premiership, you need to bring in a minimum of three players and maximum of five players. Any more than that and you could ruin team spirit. My biggest problem when I took Palace up in 1994 was that my relationship with Ron Noades, the chairman at the time, was already breaking down. He thought he could do my job and I thought I could do his, quite honestly. I knew we needed to add to the squad but Ron told me to get on with the players I had. It was a big mistake and I told him so, and by the time we managed to bring in players of the quality of Ray Houghton, towards the end of that season, we were on the way down. That is why I would suggest you must spend another \u00a310m or so to get the number and quality of players you need to step up a level. City and Charlton have spent that sort of money but Ipswich have not, which is why I fear for them. It also helps to have financial muscle if you are to win promotion in the first place, which is why Blackburn and Fulham are favourites to go up. Around \u00a325m has been spent by First Division clubs this summer and there is bound to be more as the season progresses. This time last season I suggested that any three of 13 teams could go up, and it is not very different this year. The division is so even in terms of quality, and almost every manager is a well-known name. People such as Graham Taylor, David Platt, Trevor Francis, Dave Bassett and Graeme Souness, for example. Early season form is probably more of an indicator in this division than in the Premiership. Hopefully we will be among the contenders, but it will as hard as I can remember in the First Division.",

      "bodyText": "Another of England's qualifying matches for football's 2002 World Cup could end up on pay-per-view television. It was this column that broke the news last week that u&gt;direct, the independent pay-per-view broadcaster, had scooped the live rights for England's match in Finland on 11 October, and the same company, unabashed by some of the strident criticism the deal has received, are not ruling out a bid for the match in Greece on 6 June next year. 'We remain interested in all competitive games at all levels and that includes the game in Greece,' says Roger Hall, u&gt;direct's marketing manager. The away match against Greece is England's only remaining qualifier that still has to be bought by television, and the Greek FA are likely to find the agents who peddle these matches even more solicitous than usual after the sky-high deal brokered on behalf of the Finnish FA. Much will depend, though, on whether Global Sportnet, who were part of the chain that delivered the Finland game to u&gt;direct for a hefty \u00a33 million, are given the task of placing the match. Two other agents, CSI and Ufa, are also seeking the business. Ufa have just acquired England's qualifier in Albania next March for Channel 5, and might do the same with the Greece match if they were appointed agents.

For Robson and club alike, this promises to be the most defining campaign yet. </p> <p>The latter, specifically its multi-millionaire owner Steve Gibson, has invested around \u00a360 million in new players under Robson's stewardship - reaping three losing cup final appearances in return. </p> <p>For Robson the manager, the new season carries with it the implicit acceptance that a career once perceived to be on a fast-track to bigger and better opportunities has, at best, had the brakes firmly applied. </p> <p>England and, arguably more appealingly, a certain position at one of his former clubs made available in May 2002, were assumed to be Robson's jobs to accept or, more accurately, lose. </p> <p>A seventh unproductive season at the Riverside would surely see the 43-year-old's standing slip even further and, in the case of the pending Manchester United post, would leave him with just one more year to convince the club's power men that he is the man to maintain the healthy state of United's trophy room and share price. </p> <p>It is with such thoughts that he analyses the coming season and offers a frank view of the urgent need for the club to start turning investment into return and for Robson himself to demonstrate he is still worthy of the flattering attention he received when the Football Association asked if he would be interested in succeeding Terry Venables as England manager four years ago. </p> <p>'I wasn't ready for it then,' says Robson of the opportunity. 'I needed more experience at club level and I also didn't want to lose the day-to-day contact with players, I was too young to do that. </p> <p>'But I would like to be considered again at some stage in the future. What I have to do is prove my capability at club level before that happens, if it ever does happen. </p> <p>'When I came here I saw it as a stepping stone to a bigger club, I admit that. But I no longer look at this job as a way of staking my claim at a bigger club. This IS a big club.' </p> <p>Big in terms of investment, yes. In terms of success, no. Instead, Robson's six-year reign has been characterised by intense transfer activity - he has raised \u00a340m in sales to offset the \u00a360m expenditure - and a series of incidents that would occupy the script writers of football soap opera Dream Team for a series or more. </p> <p>There were the mercurial performances, both on and off the field, of new arrivals Juninho, Ravanelli and Emerson - guaranteeing tabloid headlines virtually every week. Relegation then followed in 1997, brought about by losing points for failing to fulfil a fixture against Blackburn. </p> <p>England and Manchester United may offer higher profile positions, but they could not possibly prove more eventful. </p> <p>'If we had not been relegated, I'm convinced we would have been able to keep all three of them and build on it,' adds Robson. 'That was my thinking. We got enough points on the pitch to stay up but being fined three points for not playing at Blackburn sent us down. </p> <p>'It was devastating for the club and set us back a long way. Also, I was learning. I tried to make us run before we could walk. I jumped in for the top players before we were ready. Even so, if we hadn't been relegated, I think it would have succeeded. </p> <p>'Juninho is a great little fellow who ran his heart out for us and that's why we tried to bring him back. Ravenelli was used to the best, his last goal before he joined us won the European Cup Final, and we were training at an open prison at the time. He was critical and we tried to tell him we could not do everything overnight and showed him the plans. It wasn't good enough - yet he still scored 31 goals for us. </p> <p>'Emerson was a very good player and, contrary to all the stories, was not trouble. He did disappear to Brazil but only once and he claimed he had a contract grievance then. I was sorry to lose him, he battled to keep us up, playing with injuries when the fans thought he wasn't performing.' </p> <p>Middlesbrough's successful attempt to bounce back at the first attempt brought Robson in contact with arguably his greatest managerial challenge to date, Paul Gascoigne. </p> <p>His arrival in February 1998 helped Middlesbrough secure automatic promotion by a single point and, even though Robson did not fight to keep him this summer, Gascoigne is still clearly a player close to his heart. </p> <p>'Gazza is mad but everybody loved him here,' added Robson. 'People say he was a waste of money but he arrived in February and we went up by one point. </p> <p>'He was a great influence for us and he might have been the reason we made it. He then helped give us a good start in the Premiership before his troubles started and he had to endure a lot of bad luck with injuries. </p> <p>'But, if he had not been injured in the 1991 Cup final with Spurs, I believe he would have become the number one player in the world. What he needs now is an injury-free run.' </p> <p>Undoubtedly what 42-year-old haulage company owner Gibson, whose current wealth is estimated at \u00a3100m, needs now is to see a return on a financial commitment that also includes the \u00a325m Riverside Stadium and a planned \u00a310m training complex near Darlington. </p> <p>Gibson and Robson insist their relationship is not the 'old pals act' that is often perceived in football circles. In fact, the man who saved Middlesbrough from bankruptcy in 1986 often refers to the rows that the pair have had. </p> <p>Cynics claim that a normal chairman-manager relationship would have seen Robson looking for new employment long ago, yet, conversely, inside opinion is that after selling seven per cent of his shares to communications company NTL this summer, Gibson handed Robson \u00a315m to spend on players, warning the manager to stop signing so many over-30s and to bring in some genuine crowd pleasers. Gascoigne, it is thought, was a victim of this policy. </p> <p>The response has been promising. Christian Karembeu, Paul Okon, Noel Whelan, Joseph-Desire Job and Alen Boksic represent an impressive list of signings for a total transfer outlay of only \u00a39.5m, although their addition to the squad might simply add to the pressure on the manager to start delivering. </p> <p>'I hope it will be our year and we'll have that little bit more fortune than we had last year in the cups,' says Robson, who saw his team exit tamely from Worthington and FA Cups to Tranmere and Wrexham last season. </p> <p>'The club is better placed than at any time since I came here. The top players are becoming more difficult to sign than was the case a few years ago but I feel we've got a real solid foundation in the club now. The players have proved that over the last two years with 51 points and 52 Premiership points. </p> <p>'I have had quite a bit of money to spend and it has been up to me to spend it right and take us even further forward. So yes, next season will probably be the strongest position we've been in since I came to the club. </p> <p>'Some of our fans were unhappy at one stage and people said the answer was: \"Look back to where we were five years ago.\" But I don't want to look back. </p> <p>'I've said since I came here that I just want the club to keep improving. </p> <p>'I still do feel that we are achieving that and, as long as we can take another step next season, that will be good. </p> <p>'The one thing I'm happy about here is that the chairman and myself are not just content to say we're a stable Premiership club. After all, I think there are quite a few clubs out there who are quite happy to be just that.'</p>",

For Robson and club alike, this promises to be the most defining campaign yet. The latter, specifically its multi-millionaire owner Steve Gibson, has invested around \u00a360 million in new players under Robson's stewardship - reaping three losing cup final appearances in return. For Robson the manager, the new season carries with it the implicit acceptance that a career once perceived to be on a fast-track to bigger and better opportunities has, at best, had the brakes firmly applied. England and, arguably more appealingly, a certain position at one of his former clubs made available in May 2002, were assumed to be Robson's jobs to accept or, more accurately, lose.

It is with such thoughts that he analyses the coming season and offers a frank view of the urgent need for the club to start turning investment into return and for Robson himself to demonstrate he is still worthy of the flattering attention he received when the Football Association asked if he would be interested in succeeding Terry Venables as England manager four years ago.

I was in Bangkok to photograph an emergency crew, who waited on the city's streets for road accidents to happen. None of them could speak English. So we communicated in sign language, spiced with a curious vocabulary. </p> <p>On my first morning someone said something like this, enhanced with guttural sounds that I could not understand but which were clearly directed at me: 'Libapoo, libapoo, number one, number one.' I nodded. That seemed to please the crew, and someone else had another crack at conversation: 'Mahkal oh-wan, fa, number one.' Then one guy screwed up his face and said, 'Anal-aka, overpaid, Spain, Spain.' For a second I thought I had been blessed with the gift of tongues. But as I followed his hand pointing south out of Bangkok towards a generic Spain, I grasped the idea: these people were fluent in English football. </p> <p>During the next month I learned nothing about my hosts' lives outside work except that 18 of the 32 were Liverpool fans, 10 supported Manchester United, and the rest a variety of other clubs including Leicester City and Charlton. </p> <p>The hospitals we saw were also full of Premier League fans. On one quiet evening in the Accident and Emergency ward, no fewer than five patients came in wearing Liverpool FC gear. The doctor sewing one of them up downed tools and danced about the ward because his pager had told him that Arsenal had beaten Chelsea 2-1. </p> <p>It turned out that these were not isolated incidents. Every Saturday night around six million Thais sit down to watch a match live from an invariably inclement England. The sport even affects Bangkok's notorious traffic jobs. 'It's a great benefit to the gridlocked streets in the centre,' says Lieutenant Colonel Wonglee of the Royal Thai Police. 'And big matchdays make our job considerably easier as the streets can be, by Bangkok's standards, deserted. People stay at home and watch. They don't drink and then drive.' </p> <p>The experience of watching a match in Thailand is curious because the British commentary can be heard beneath the Thai. Often words are lifted from the English version to embellish the Thai, such as 'foul', 'slice', 'ref', 'dive,' and, inevitably, 'Goal!' Whole phrases are borrowed too: 'on the right,' 'would you believe it,' and 'oh my God.' These can evolve into peculiar Thai-English expressions like 'believe it, believe it' and 'my God, my God, my God!' I spent one entire match bemused by the constant refrain of 'you fuck up', until I grasped that it was a reference to the Uefa Cup. </p> <p>Why the Premier League? One reason is the Thai penchant for gambling. 'I've had a bad run on Chelsea in the League,' one friend told me. 'We've got to turn things around or I'll be broke by the rainy season.' Nearly all forms of gambling are illegal in Thailand, but they are almost impossible to stop as people transfer their winnings from bank account to bank account the day after the match. Gambling on matches abroad eliminates the fear that Thais may try and nobble players; unlike cricket and India. German football is perceived as boring and Thais assume the Italians do nobble players. Consequently it is estimated that 120 billion baht (over \u00a32 billion) is gambled by Thais on the Premier League every season. </p> <p>But the passion for the Premier League runs much deeper than gambling, as the unveiling of David Beckham's statue at the central Buddha monument in the Wat Pariwas temple in Bangkok suggests. His floppy topped image was carved on the lower slopes of the monument, in a position reserved for minor deities. Pakdee Nuntiwajrind of Thai's Channel 3, which broadcast Euro 2000, explains: 'He has single-handedly changed the profile of the football fan. An entire female audience has been attracted to the game by his looks and his personality.' Beckham's grinning features are plastered over everything in Thailand from buses to beer mats. He and Michael Owen are as important as cultural icons as Thai pop and soap stars. But their hold over the Thai audience is partly as emblems of the teams they represent. </p> <p>On the third floor of the Discovery Building in Bangkok, the 'Star's Soccer' shop sells every conceivable fanzine and football video and a plethora of team kits and posters. Beckham and Owen (and with them United and Liverpool) dominate the sales. Both Liverpool and United's official supporter's magazines appear in Thai. Liverpool recently went one further by translating the title of the magazine itself into Thai. Anek Yongkhord of the shop Star's Soccer explains: 'I think this was a deliberate attempt on the part of Liverpool supporters in the face of the rise of Manchester United to remind people of their loyalty - that Liverpool is Thailand's team.' </p> <p>Many Thais seem to believe that the Premiership, with its wealthy international stars, confers a global status upon those who follow it. As one fan put it to me, by supporting Liverpool, Thailand itself became a 'player'. He explained: 'In the past, when Liverpool won the Cup or league, there was a sense of national happiness, because as a nation we had won.' </p> <p>In Thailand's headlong rush through the boom and bust of the last fifteen years, one constant has been the ambition to be world-class, to match the developed world in some field. Premiership clubs can do this for you. By supporting Liverpool, some Thais felt instantly involved in a sophisticated western culture. Poor families in a Third World country could become honorary Englishmen, worrying about a forthcoming match with West Ham in exactly the same way as a merchant banker in The Chalfonts. Thais will often discuss the relative merits of stadia they have never visited or of weather conditions they have never experienced. </p> <p>Conversely, almost all are scathing about their own national side: 'Weak... unimaginative...skilless...not world class...' But late on a Saturday night, watching the English match live, they become world-class soccer fans. </p> <p>However, it would be wrong to assume that Thais support the England national team itself. Yongkhord said of the last World Cup: 'The vast majority supported Brazil, some Argentina, some Holland. We're not stupid. Supporting England would be like supporting Thailand. England won't be number one.'</p>",

Anek Yongkhord of the shop Star's Soccer explains: 'I think this was a deliberate attempt on the part of Liverpool supporters in the face of the rise of Manchester United to remind people of their loyalty - that Liverpool is Thailand's team.' Many Thais seem to believe that the Premiership, with its wealthy international stars, confers a global status upon those who follow it. As one fan put it to me, by supporting Liverpool, Thailand itself became a 'player'. He explained: 'In the past, when Liverpool won the Cup or league, there was a sense of national happiness, because as a nation we had won.' In Thailand's headlong rush through the boom and bust of the last fifteen years, one constant has been the ambition to be world-class, to match the developed world in some field. Premiership clubs can do this for you. By supporting Liverpool, some Thais felt instantly involved in a sophisticated western culture. Poor families in a Third World country could become honorary Englishmen, worrying about a forthcoming match with West Ham in exactly the same way as a merchant banker in The Chalfonts. Thais will often discuss the relative merits of stadia they have never visited or of weather conditions they have never experienced. Conversely, almost all are scathing about their own national side: 'Weak... unimaginative...skilless...not world class...' But late on a Saturday night, watching the English match live, they become world-class soccer fans. However, it would be wrong to assume that Thais support the England national team itself. Yongkhord said of the last World Cup: 'The vast majority supported Brazil, some Argentina, some Holland. We're not stupid. Supporting England would be like supporting Thailand. England won't be number one.'",

Players who make mistakes can expect a certain amount of stick from the fans, that happens in Holland too, but they don't abuse you or your family.' </p> <p>Despite his reservations about some of this country's football supporters Stam is looking forward to his third season in England, and has no plans at present to play anywhere else. He also dismisses the theory that there are too many easy games in the Premiership. 'Some games are harder than others, but it was a big shock to me when I came here to find every match was a big match,' he explained. 'You are never out of the spotlight, everyone wants to play well against Manchester United. You always have to give 100 per cent, even against the bottom team, and I like that. It is not the same in Holland, where the big clubs can take it easy against the smaller teams.' </p> <p>Stam believes the top of the Premiership will be closer and more competitive this season, and picks Liverpool as the side likely to push United the furthest. 'They were strong last season, and they are even more powerful now,' he said. 'They seem to be deliberately going after big, physical players, and I'm sure they are going to be hard to beat.' </p> <p>While Liverpool, Leeds, Chelsea and Arsenal have all been investing heavily over the summer, Sir Alex Ferguson has contented himself with just Fabien Barthez, to resolve his long-standing goalkeeping problem. Stam confirms he has no intention of kissing the Frenchman's shaven head whatever the circumstances but understands he will have to strike up a rapport with the new arrival, if only to get shouted at for being in the wrong place. </p> <p>'Fabien is still picking up the language, but I'm sure he'll be a good signing,' Stam said. 'He's not afraid of anything, he's used to playing in big games and he's coped with loads of pressure playing for France.

He strikes me as a guy who wants to win prizes, like myself, and if that is the case then you choose the club, not the city.' </p> <p>Stam shares his manager's opinion that the squad is big enough at the moment, and does not need strengthening as much as time to mature.

      "body": "<p>The modernisation of Liverpool has spread to the club's famous old Melwood training ground. It used to be bleak and unwelcoming; now there is a showroom-shiny reception area where the secretary's computer flashes the screensaver: 'England's most successful club.' </p> <p>From there to the manager's office, the corridor winds past what resembles a TV editing suite, where a coach is digitally collating incidents from a match video for training purposes. Bill Shankly, who at this time of year used to consult a little notebook for handwritten details of training methods used during the last pre-season with a view to simply repeating them for another trophy-winning year, would hardly recognise it. </p> <p>Not that the great man is forgotten. His portrait stands in Gerard Houllier's office on a cabinet containing tapes of goals conceded and European football handbooks, immediately facing the current manager's chair behind a desk that groans under the weight of back issues of L'Equipe and France Football. Houllier is clearly inspired by the Shankly persona that so moved him as an impressionable student of the city and the game it made its own some 30 years ago. </p> <p>One big thing about Houllier: all football managers have egos but his is subdued for the greater good. A picture of him with his Manager of the Month award for last December shows the whole coaching staff. Another of him is with Aime Jacquet smiling over the World Cup. A poster proclaims the Liverpool philosophy: 'Respect. Be a Winner. Always be a top pro.' And, most important: 'Think team first.' </p> <p>Houllier knows that expectation, inside Anfield and beyond, is growing for him to deliver a first trophy of his reign, to challenge United anew and establish Liverpool as a modern force rather than a club with a great future behind them. His first season was about taking stock, the alarming and, to him, unexpected conclusion being that major rather than cosmetic surgery was needed. Last year a rebuilt squad containing eight new signings worth \u00a336 million showed pedigree and promise but fell two points short of a Champions League place due to a collapse of three defeats in their last four games. Even from that, though, he takes heart: 'It leaves space for improvement. I don't like it when you progress too soon.' </p> <p>This summer the total has reached a nice round \u00a350m (though Houllier points out he has recouped around half that in sales) with the addition of Nicky Barmby, Markus Babbel, and Bernard Diomede. It may well rise with the acquisition of Christian Ziege from Middlesbrough. The wage bill certainly has, with Gary McAllister's arrival. </p> <p>So after a season and a half of understanding indulgence does Houllier sense a greater burden of a silver return? He is cautious - humble as he likes to put it - but accepts the point. 'We have two aims. First, to consolidate, to make sure that we continue to build on our concrete base. Then to win a trophy. In sports, you cannot programme success or plan it. You can just prepare for success and that's what we are doing. I feel that a good target for everybody would be to step up a little bit from where we are and that means the top three. </p> <p>'But it will be difficult. Manchester United still look very hungry and I am sure Arsenal will challenge. Leeds and Chelsea have made some good signings and so have Tottenham and Newcastle. Every team has tried to strengthen.' </p> <p>Houllier believes that 80 per cent of the job has been done, in terms of team rebuilding, but 'the other 20 per cent you won't change in a year.' He prefers not to dwell on the bad start or finish but the 25-game run in between, during which Liverpool lost only twice. </p> <p>'After our ending, there is a temptation to say that it didn't work and start something else. But it worked for 25 games. Perhaps we had some players lacking experience, some injuries, maybe we lacked quality and strength in depth but we showed we could repeat performances. Before people were saying \"Oh yes, Liverpool can be very good for one or two games and then they flop when the pressure is on.\" We are more consistent. </p> <p>'Don't forget we had the best defence. If you watch what is going on at the top level now, the defending has to be practically perfection. If you have good defending, you can take risks, you can have the initiative and be spontaneous. When we don't have the ball, as a team we have improved in discipline, work rate, team work. We have a young side, promising players, good prospects. They have to gain experience and then they will definitely achieve something.' </p> <p>He expects more from his strikers this season, after missing Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen for much of the last campaign. Emile Heskey will come under particularly close scrutiny after his \u00a311m move last March. 'Maybe after this summer it is not any more so much money,' Houllier jokes. 'When you are a goalkeeper or striker you are under fire. I look at what Emile brings to the team and he brings something I didn't have before. He is strong, powerful and quick. He gives us an aerial capacity we didn't have. If he decides sometimes to go through, nobody can stop him. </p> <p>'He is not selfish or arrogant, perfect in the team work. I would say he has to believe in himself and needs to build up his ambitions. That will come, because he takes on board everything he is told. He is only 22. I was told that Shearer was not a great goalscorer early on (he is right; 23 goals in 118 League games for Southampton). For Emile it is just a matter of getting comfortable.' </p> <p>Houllier is close to the depth of squad he knows is needed in the Premiership and Europe, one which contains versatility and cover in every position. The problem will be, he admits, in keeping them all content. 'Some players will go, they will get restless and be unhappy about not playing regularly. But who scored the the goals for France in the Euro 2000 final? Who for Manchester United when they won the Champions League? In the modern game now you need a strong bench with flexibility, players who can create new problems for the opposition. </p> <p>'I believe we have variation. The best teams can show tactical flexibility from one game to another, or within the same game. We can have different types of play. Sometimes we can play higher up, sometimes we will have to be cautious. </p> <p>'But you can't do without basic things. You look at the successful teams.

      "bodyText": "The modernisation of Liverpool has spread to the club's famous old Melwood training ground. It used to be bleak and unwelcoming; now there is a showroom-shiny reception area where the secretary's computer flashes the screensaver: 'England's most successful club.' From there to the manager's office, the corridor winds past what resembles a TV editing suite, where a coach is digitally collating incidents from a match video for training purposes. Bill Shankly, who at this time of year used to consult a little notebook for handwritten details of training methods used during the last pre-season with a view to simply repeating them for another trophy-winning year, would hardly recognise it. Not that the great man is forgotten. His portrait stands in Gerard Houllier's office on a cabinet containing tapes of goals conceded and European football handbooks, immediately facing the current manager's chair behind a desk that groans under the weight of back issues of L'Equipe and France Football. Houllier is clearly inspired by the Shankly persona that so moved him as an impressionable student of the city and the game it made its own some 30 years ago. One big thing about Houllier: all football managers have egos but his is subdued for the greater good. A picture of him with his Manager of the Month award for last December shows the whole coaching staff. Another of him is with Aime Jacquet smiling over the World Cup. A poster proclaims the Liverpool philosophy: 'Respect. Be a Winner. Always be a top pro.' And, most important: 'Think team first.' Houllier knows that expectation, inside Anfield and beyond, is growing for him to deliver a first trophy of his reign, to challenge United anew and establish Liverpool as a modern force rather than a club with a great future behind them. His first season was about taking stock, the alarming and, to him, unexpected conclusion being that major rather than cosmetic surgery was needed. Last year a rebuilt squad containing eight new signings worth \u00a336 million showed pedigree and promise but fell two points short of a Champions League place due to a collapse of three defeats in their last four games. Even from that, though, he takes heart: 'It leaves space for improvement. I don't like it when you progress too soon.' This summer the total has reached a nice round \u00a350m (though Houllier points out he has recouped around half that in sales) with the addition of Nicky Barmby, Markus Babbel, and Bernard Diomede. It may well rise with the acquisition of Christian Ziege from Middlesbrough. The wage bill certainly has, with Gary McAllister's arrival. So after a season and a half of understanding indulgence does Houllier sense a greater burden of a silver return? He is cautious - humble as he likes to put it - but accepts the point. 'We have two aims. First, to consolidate, to make sure that we continue to build on our concrete base. Then to win a trophy. In sports, you cannot programme success or plan it. You can just prepare for success and that's what we are doing. I feel that a good target for everybody would be to step up a little bit from where we are and that means the top three. 'But it will be difficult. Manchester United still look very hungry and I am sure Arsenal will challenge. Leeds and Chelsea have made some good signings and so have Tottenham and Newcastle. Every team has tried to strengthen.' Houllier believes that 80 per cent of the job has been done, in terms of team rebuilding, but 'the other 20 per cent you won't change in a year.' He prefers not to dwell on the bad start or finish but the 25-game run in between, during which Liverpool lost only twice. 'After our ending, there is a temptation to say that it didn't work and start something else. But it worked for 25 games. Perhaps we had some players lacking experience, some injuries, maybe we lacked quality and strength in depth but we showed we could repeat performances. Before people were saying \"Oh yes, Liverpool can be very good for one or two games and then they flop when the pressure is on.\" We are more consistent. 'Don't forget we had the best defence. If you watch what is going on at the top level now, the defending has to be practically perfection. If you have good defending, you can take risks, you can have the initiative and be spontaneous. When we don't have the ball, as a team we have improved in discipline, work rate, team work. We have a young side, promising players, good prospects. They have to gain experience and then they will definitely achieve something.' He expects more from his strikers this season, after missing Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen for much of the last campaign. Emile Heskey will come under particularly close scrutiny after his \u00a311m move last March. 'Maybe after this summer it is not any more so much money,' Houllier jokes. 'When you are a goalkeeper or striker you are under fire. I look at what Emile brings to the team and he brings something I didn't have before. He is strong, powerful and quick. He gives us an aerial capacity we didn't have. If he decides sometimes to go through, nobody can stop him. 'He is not selfish or arrogant, perfect in the team work. I would say he has to believe in himself and needs to build up his ambitions. That will come, because he takes on board everything he is told. He is only 22. I was told that Shearer was not a great goalscorer early on (he is right; 23 goals in 118 League games for Southampton). For Emile it is just a matter of getting comfortable.' Houllier is close to the depth of squad he knows is needed in the Premiership and Europe, one which contains versatility and cover in every position. The problem will be, he admits, in keeping them all content. 'Some players will go, they will get restless and be unhappy about not playing regularly. But who scored the the goals for France in the Euro 2000 final? Who for Manchester United when they won the Champions League? In the modern game now you need a strong bench with flexibility, players who can create new problems for the opposition. 'I believe we have variation. The best teams can show tactical flexibility from one game to another, or within the same game. We can have different types of play. Sometimes we can play higher up, sometimes we will have to be cautious. 'But you can't do without basic things. You look at the successful teams. I don't think you can play with only one defensive midfield player any more. You need a square shape in front of the defence because the level of strikers now is awesome. They are quick, they can dribble and take on players. Then, if you have the square base, the players on the sides have to attack.' It is why he would play Ziege at left-back. He likes the term 'attacking athletes.' The politics and economics of Spanish and Italian clubs may have given the impression that the Premiership is falling behind but Houllier does not see it on the pitch. 'I saw Chelsea beat Barcelona, Leeds beat Roma and Arsenal beat Deportivo La Coruna comprehensively last season and Deportivo are the Spanish champions. Clubs are still strong here. The football is always entertaining because of the pace and intensity although gradually the skill will have to be better. You have to improve your skill to dictate the tempo of the game.' 'Manchester United have done it but they built up their side and management over years of consistency,' he adds, pointing out that it took Sir Alex Ferguson four years to win a trophy and seven a title. It prompts Houllier into a final thought that appears to be the guiding principle in Liverpool's modernisation programme: 'The title can change a lot of things.'",

Charming. </p> <p>Even though a number of clubs more suitable to his lifestyle were interested none could match Villa's \u00a33 million offer. This left Ginola with a dispiriting dilemma: stay at Tottenham where the boss had written him out of the script or go on to sample a warm welcome at the Villa and hope uprooting the family for life outside the capital causes less heartache than the Ginolas' spell on Tyneside.

Curiously enough for such a sumptuously talented player it's a recurring theme in his career. Before George it was Kenny Dalglish giving him the cold shoulder at Newcastle, and prior to that Luis Fernandez - a former team-mate and someone who always came across as slightly jealous of his opulent gifts - froze him out at Paris Saint-Germain. </p> <p>More damagingly, the curse of sudden rejection even struck at international level, when he was dropped like a stone for an under-hit pass and ostracised ever since after Gerard Houllier cruelly blamed him for France missing out on USA 94. </p> <p>Every time it disappoints, frustrates, hurts. He has a habit of responding positively. 'It's true, all my career I've bounced back every time I've had a problem,' he says. 'Having said that I didn't really have a problem with Tottenham. Everything was fine. In the last three years I did quite well. At Newcastle we changed manager and he didn't include me in his plans so I had to think about a move. </p> <p>'It was a similar case with Tottenham this summer. It was unfortunate, because I felt I could still give a lot to both clubs. But you have to think about what is good. Staying at Tottenham wouldn't have been good for both of us.' </p> <p>Now he intends to bounce back once more, this time at Villa. 'The only thing I will try to do is to integrate myself well and show my commitment to the game and the club,' says the 33-year-old. 'I want to bring to Aston Villa all my ability, all my passion for the game, everything I provide all my career: just coming out on to the pitch with the passion for the ball and the desire to do something great. After 15 years of football I still have the same passion for winning.' </p> <p>He brings an instant feelgood factor to a club whose morale has been dented by season ticket slumps, financial losses, and a series of senior players seeking moves.

      "body": "<p>Without wishing to state the obvious or feed Sir Alex Ferguson's paranoia about anti-Manchester United bias in the media, it is about time someone else won the Premiership title. </p> <p>United have deserved every one of their successes, no doubt about that, but the fact that their six wins in eight years have been divided neatly into groups of two by the interventions of Blackburn and Arsenal helps mask an almost unhealthy dominance. When one considers United were runners-up by a single point in both 1995 and 1998, and were handicapped in the first instance by Eric Cantona's suspension and in the second by the even lengthier absence of Roy Keane, a truer picture emerges. Everyone laughs at the Scottish Premiership for being dominated by two clubs, but in England, with due respect to Arsenal, the statistics suggest we have just the one. </p> <p>Another sure sign of a stranglehold on success is that challengers to the perennial pacesetters gradually fall by the wayside, exhausted by the effort. Think of Blackburn Rovers, now in the Nationwide League, or of Newcastle United, twice runners-up to Manchester United but more concerned with relegation ever since. No one is suggesting Arsenal are about to go the same way, though Arsene Wenger is having to work twice as hard as Ferguson to keep his squad together and his playing strength up to scratch. </p> <p>This season Arsenal supporters would probably be delighted to finish second, since few imagine the club can now mount a realistic title challenge. One should never underestimate Wenger's ability to source overseas players, and theoretically Arsenal have big money to spend following the sale of Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit, but even were the players available chequebook teambuilding is not really the manager's style. Arsenal will almost certainly be rebuilding patiently and prudently. </p> <p>So, as Manchester United have won the title for the past two seasons and according to the pattern it is someone else's turn to send out for Brasso, who is it going to be? Will it be Leeds United, so impressive for so much of last season? Will it be Liverpool, undeniably moving in the right direction under Gerard Houllier, albeit in hesitant steps rather than giant strides? Or could it be Chelsea, traditionally taken about as seriously as William Hague's drinking exploits but handily placed to spring a surprise. </p> <p>That would be about as surprising as the Premiership can get, since it is difficult to envisage any club without a Champions League-sized squad breaking through the ranks and finishing on top. Leeds gave it a good go last season, but were overhauled by the usual suspects in the end, and the Elland Road club has more resources than many. Indeed, since the advent of the Champions League and its bloating effect on participating teams, clubs in the tier immediately below have downscaled their ambitions. </p> <p>A Champions League placing, for a club like Aston Villa, Everton, Sunderland or Spurs, would represent success beyond their supporters' wildest dreams. From that platform it might be possible to go even higher in time, but just as you don't climb Everest without a base camp, no one on the Premiership's lower slopes seriously contemplates a direct assault on the summit. Or as Martin O'Neill said before he left Leicester for Celtic: 'I don't think it is possible for a provincial team to win the league anymore.' From an acolyte of Brian Clough, who won championships with unfashionable sides without massive budgets or huge squads, this is a sad admission, and a reminder of what has been lost in the dash to cash of the last eight years. </p> <p>Which brings us back to the moneybags of Manchester United. If you are placing a bet on the outcome of the title race, look no further than Old Trafford. It is true that United have tended to win two championships then lose one, and there is a suspicion that Ferguson and his players are more concerned about regaining the European Cup this season, but none of these are convincing reasons to back against the wealthiest club in the country which has won the competition four times in the last five. </p> <p>If that sounds too boring, or you are looking for a more generous price, then consider Chelsea. You might have to contend with a few sniggers in the betting shop, but Chelsea are ambitious. They have money. They have a large squad, which Gianluca Vialli has not only managed to keep together against expectation but augmented. They have a good goalkeeper and have just signed a proven goalscorer. They are not in the Champions League, unlike their immediate rivals, and are unlikely to let the Uefa Cup distract them from winning a domestic prize which would fulfil Vialli and make Ken Bates a happy man. They have demonstrated they can beat United. </p> <p>The only reason people do not fancy them is their reputation as a bunch of southern softies who wear gloves in November and have no stomach for Saturday afternoons in Yorkshire. These criticisms were perfectly valid last season, when Chelsea were guilty of pinning all their hopes on the Champions League, but to assume they will carry on in the same way may be to underestimate Vialli's determination and his players' pride. A lot of reputations are at stake this season, and for that reason if no other, Chelsea have a chance. </p> <p>So too do Leeds and Liverpool, though again one feels top three would suit both. Leeds still have last season's off the field problems to contend with, will lose Harry Kewell to the Olympic Games, and are already complaining they have too few players. With other teams now aware of their potential Leeds might not be able to make the confident start which took the Premiership by surprise 12 months ago. </p> <p>Liverpool have made some interesting signings, but in the continued absence of Robbie Fowler it is hard to imagine Nick Barmby or any of the others transforming a team which fell so limply out of the top three last season. Liverpool should go well, they have a core of good players which should see to that, but unless Michael Owen weighs in with a sackful of goals the leap from also-rans to winners may be beyond them. </p> <p>At the other end of the table, one or two established Premiership sides - notably Southampton and Derby County - must be getting nervous. Of the three promoted sides, only Ipswich Town can be reliably expected to go back down. Charlton have strengthened their squad since being relegated two years ago and should be stronger for the experience. Manchester City appear to be the same comedy act as ever, but if simply staying in the top flight is the name of the game then they have the right manager in Joe Royle. Even if Bradford City go down, which they probably will despite throwing their money around, there is still a chance of some long-term Premiership residents going the same way as Wimbledon. </p> <p>That said, all three relegated teams deserved to go down last season. None of them put up much of a fight, and it said a lot that Bradford were able to save themselves with just a couple of plucky performances at the end. This time, it seems more likely that more teams will be drawn into the struggle, in fact the bottom of the table could be a lot more competitive than the top. That's progress for you. It's a good thing we can all rely on Chelsea.</p>",

      "body": "<p>With all the talk about contracts and comings and goings, the best deal Arsenal could do right now is to get Arsene Wenger to sign an extension.

'I could teach that to many managers: don't stay in your last season. Go one year before, because otherwise the club feels it has no future with you anymore and the first bad period you are out.' That is precisely what happened to him at Monaco. He turned down Bayern Munich to give it one more season in the Principality after his club begged him not to leave them in the lurch. Five games in, after a poor start, he was sacked. </p> <p>The notion of Arsenal firing Wenger, the inspiration behind an extraordinary transformation since he landed from Japan almost four years ago, is unimaginable at the moment. But that is not the point. He knows from experience that the final countdown is always a time of uncertainty and distraction. He prefers to be decisive and focused, qualities which are key to success. </p> <p>Wenger is an ambitious man. It rankles if he doesn't win a trophy every year (the previous two have finished barren) and he craves the Champions League (way off his club's radar to date). To persuade him to commit to the longer term Arsenal must convince him he can fulfil his dreams with them. They are doing everything in their power to improve, to catch up with the multi-spending super clubs, to give him the foundations to challenge Europe's finest. </p> <p>So far they have provided him with a \u00a312 million training facility built to his own hyper-modern specifications and they are investing fortunes in a bid to speed up plans to move to a bigger stadium. Then, the logic goes, they earn more, impress more, and consequently have a chance to keep the Marc Overmarses and Emmanuel Petits or even chase the the Zinedine Zidanes. </p> <p>Wenger, although prudent with his club's purse strings, would love to work with more of the most dazzling talents on the planet. 'One day we will be able to do it,' he says. 'And to be able to do it we have to build a bigger stadium and still have a great team. At the moment we can't. Barcelona has 110,000 capacity and we have 38,000. If you don't have to balance the books you can imagine anything. You can imagine us buying Zidane tomorrow morning for \u00a360 million. So why not? Because if you think like that in two weeks the club is bankrupt and you have no training centre like this or no new stadium, that's for sure, because you never have money to build something up. Then the club will be stuck in the same position and lose players.' </p> <p>Losing players of the calibre of Overmars and Petit has injured Arsenal's reputation as a club on the up. Losing the precious Nicolas Anelka for an enormous sum was considered a one-off. Selling two more crucial players gives the impression that if you turn up at Highbury with enough noughts on the cheque you can take home your man. Wenger refutes that. 'Everybody talks so negatively about Arsenal because we just lost two players. We have to show them we still have a very strong squad. If it's just a question of money why does Milan or Inter Milan not win the European Cup every year? There is something more to football. It's team spirit, collective quality, work on the field, giving a chance to young players. We have players here who have been rejected by the Italian system who are now stars, like Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry. It is about making the right decisions.' </p> <p>Wenger is making confident noises about the season ahead even though it's obvious his squad is not as rounded as he would like. He had anticipated losing two and gaining four during the close season and it turned out the opposite. It has been an inclement summer. 'Cloudy and stormy,' he lamented, half smiling, not fooling anyone that he was talking about the weather. </p> <p>In between protracted transfer negotiations, a watching brief at Euro 2000, more damnable negotiations, pre-season training, and another headful of negotiations thrown in for good measure, he had a week's holiday. And that's one more week than he normally takes. </p> <p>It took about 20 meetings to secure Lauren from Real Mallorca. A stack more to land Edu from Corinthians was especially maddening - a man who thought he had seen it all with the Anelka brothers never imagined the bizarre case of a Brazilian turned away at Heathrow with false papers. Work permit regulations are stifling his skill for unearthing potential gems. South America seems out of bounds, a terrific prospect from the Ivory Coast proved a non-starter, and the purchase of a clutch of Eastern Europeans duly hangs in the balance. Six days before the season kicks off the negotiations continue. </p> <p>Sometimes he feels more like a businessman than a football man. Recently, at a warm-up tournament at Ajax, he conducted a press conference where he was not asked a single question about football. Only money. His degree in economics means he talks more sense than most about the game's escalating finances but he would sooner wax lyrical about some teenage Mongolian with a perceptive left foot. </p> <p>Frustrated attempts to hone his squad are not the only reason for a cheerless summer.

      "bodyText": "With all the talk about contracts and comings and goings, the best deal Arsenal could do right now is to get Arsene Wenger to sign an extension. If not, this could be the last season the Frenchman reigns over Highbury. Although his current agreement has two years to run Wenger has an aversion to the final year of a contract. 'I could teach that to many managers: don't stay in your last season. Go one year before, because otherwise the club feels it has no future with you anymore and the first bad period you are out.' That is precisely what happened to him at Monaco. He turned down Bayern Munich to give it one more season in the Principality after his club begged him not to leave them in the lurch. Five games in, after a poor start, he was sacked. The notion of Arsenal firing Wenger, the inspiration behind an extraordinary transformation since he landed from Japan almost four years ago, is unimaginable at the moment. But that is not the point. He knows from experience that the final countdown is always a time of uncertainty and distraction. He prefers to be decisive and focused, qualities which are key to success. Wenger is an ambitious man. It rankles if he doesn't win a trophy every year (the previous two have finished barren) and he craves the Champions League (way off his club's radar to date). To persuade him to commit to the longer term Arsenal must convince him he can fulfil his dreams with them. They are doing everything in their power to improve, to catch up with the multi-spending super clubs, to give him the foundations to challenge Europe's finest. So far they have provided him with a \u00a312 million training facility built to his own hyper-modern specifications and they are investing fortunes in a bid to speed up plans to move to a bigger stadium. Then, the logic goes, they earn more, impress more, and consequently have a chance to keep the Marc Overmarses and Emmanuel Petits or even chase the the Zinedine Zidanes. Wenger, although prudent with his club's purse strings, would love to work with more of the most dazzling talents on the planet. 'One day we will be able to do it,' he says. 'And to be able to do it we have to build a bigger stadium and still have a great team. At the moment we can't. Barcelona has 110,000 capacity and we have 38,000. If you don't have to balance the books you can imagine anything. You can imagine us buying Zidane tomorrow morning for \u00a360 million. So why not? Because if you think like that in two weeks the club is bankrupt and you have no training centre like this or no new stadium, that's for sure, because you never have money to build something up. Then the club will be stuck in the same position and lose players.' Losing players of the calibre of Overmars and Petit has injured Arsenal's reputation as a club on the up. Losing the precious Nicolas Anelka for an enormous sum was considered a one-off. Selling two more crucial players gives the impression that if you turn up at Highbury with enough noughts on the cheque you can take home your man. Wenger refutes that. 'Everybody talks so negatively about Arsenal because we just lost two players. We have to show them we still have a very strong squad. If it's just a question of money why does Milan or Inter Milan not win the European Cup every year? There is something more to football. It's team spirit, collective quality, work on the field, giving a chance to young players. We have players here who have been rejected by the Italian system who are now stars, like Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry. It is about making the right decisions.' Wenger is making confident noises about the season ahead even though it's obvious his squad is not as rounded as he would like. He had anticipated losing two and gaining four during the close season and it turned out the opposite. It has been an inclement summer. 'Cloudy and stormy,' he lamented, half smiling, not fooling anyone that he was talking about the weather. In between protracted transfer negotiations, a watching brief at Euro 2000, more damnable negotiations, pre-season training, and another headful of negotiations thrown in for good measure, he had a week's holiday. And that's one more week than he normally takes. It took about 20 meetings to secure Lauren from Real Mallorca. A stack more to land Edu from Corinthians was especially maddening - a man who thought he had seen it all with the Anelka brothers never imagined the bizarre case of a Brazilian turned away at Heathrow with false papers. Work permit regulations are stifling his skill for unearthing potential gems. South America seems out of bounds, a terrific prospect from the Ivory Coast proved a non-starter, and the purchase of a clutch of Eastern Europeans duly hangs in the balance. Six days before the season kicks off the negotiations continue. Sometimes he feels more like a businessman than a football man. Recently, at a warm-up tournament at Ajax, he conducted a press conference where he was not asked a single question about football. Only money. His degree in economics means he talks more sense than most about the game's escalating finances but he would sooner wax lyrical about some teenage Mongolian with a perceptive left foot. Frustrated attempts to hone his squad are not the only reason for a cheerless summer. Wenger also had to shake off the disappointment of losing the Uefa Cup final. Let's not kid ourselves that it was not so hurtful because it was always billed as a bonus for Champions League rejects. Losing is losing, and Wenger feels a profound sense of accountability. 'When you don't win you are responsible for so many unhappy people. Sometimes it's better not to think about it because it could damage your life too much,' he muses. 'The professional aspect always takes over. Why did we lose? What did I do wrong? But you can't just wipe out those moments.' Having soothed his own anguish he turned to his squad. The fragile mind of Dennis Bergkamp needed attention. He seemed a broken man after losing the European Championship, as well as everything domestically and the Uefa Cup, on penalties. Wenger had a chat with him, reassured him, and intends to open discussions for a contract which will tie him to Arsenal for the rest of his career next week (nothing like another bout of negotiations). 'I'm very confident he will have a great season,' adds the Frenchman. The beauty of football's pattern of seasons, with its annual fresh start, ensures renewed optimism every August.

Another withdraws from confrontation at every opportunity, something which you eventually find drives you nuts. And you're sick and tired of the goodlooking smooth-talker from accounts who tells tall tales and whose anti-gay diatribe the other day just confirmed everyone's suspicions that he might have something to hide. It's enough to make you think about giving in your notice.</p> <p>But these tiresome acquaintances are not in your workplace. They are appearing almost nightly on Channel 4's Big Brother, the programme where 10 handsome young men and women have been locked up for two months in a house in London's East End, but one is voted out each week.</p> <p>When the show launched with four million viewers, critics assumed it would be sex appeal that guaranteed its audience. In fact, we have been compelled by seeing the chilling way in which a randomly-selected group of people sets about destroying one another under the genteel guise of mutual co-operation. Sounds familiar? It's probably a workplace near you.</p> <p>The most frightening thing about the melodrama being played out in front of the Channel 4 audience - and talked about by millions more than admit to watching the programme - is its alarming similarity to the worlds in which we all live. Home, school, college and most of all work are environments in which we can often identify relatives, friends or colleagues whose apotheosis we now see on our television screens.</p> <p>'This is the ambulance effect,' explains Professor Cary Cooper, Britain's leading specialist in work relationships. 'You see potential disaster and you want to look. The biggest similarity of all that Big Brother possesses is to a workplace. After all, they are working, even if they don't do much, and also they are competing.</p> <p>'Work is just like a game; some people get promotion, some people get rejected and some people who don't get promoted will leave. We're learning from Big Brother who is perceived to be worthwhile and who will be retained.</p> <p>'That's just like the office. People chat at the coffee machine and talk about other people and their relationships. This programme actually allows you not just to hear those sorts of rumours secondhand.'</p> <p>However, in the Big Brother house - like too many workplaces - there is a much more sinister objective lurking beneath much of the residents' conversational veneer. Each is jockeying for someone else to be ditched.</p> <p>Julie Bower might have identified with Sada or Caroline, both now evicted from the house. If Bower had time to watch television. The 35-year old City analyst has been suing Schroder Securities for unfair dismissal.</p> <p>The picture Bower created of her erstwhile employers is one where large numbers of other people - most of them men - appear to have been engaged in undermining her confidence and professional standing while also conspiring to reduce her remuneration package. Her annual bonus was slashed to 'just' \u00a3125,000 while her colleagues, who routinely e-mailed each other unkindly about her, received up to \u00a3425,000.</p> <p>'Big Brother shows us an environment where people are uncomfortable with their roles,' said Angela Ishmael of the Industrial Society. 'It's exactly what's happening in lots of workplaces. When managers aren't able to manage relationships in a team, team power takes over. It is a classic bullying scenario too, and is becoming more and more common.'</p> <p>'Nick in Big Brother is marked as dishonest for not being open about plotting to get other people thrown out,' said Ishmael. 'But he is quite genuine in terms of his feelings for his colleagues.</p> <p>'The simple truth is that he will look after himself more than everyone else. He's just more rehearsed that the rest of them at manipulating people. But Caroline, who clearly isn't liked, will tell everyone exactly how she feels.</p> <p>'Even though that's quite aggressive, most people can identify with it. The sort of thing Caroline will be accused of is not caring for other people's feelings. The sort of bullying Nick gets involved in is not as confrontational as Caroline's approach, but people do realise afterwards that they are being manipulated. That upsets them.'</p> <p>When replicated in the workplace, it upsets millions of the rest of us too. Earlier this year, the Trades Union Council published research suggesting that almost half of Britain's workforce had 'witnessed' some form of workplace bullying. One in 10 reported being bullied in the previous six months. Thousands of people in Britain are already messaging self-help websites to make complaints about 'mobbing'.</p> <p>The concept, which originated in the United States, does not apply to the classic weak victim of an over-arching superior but to the desperate individual who feels isolated in a working environment after being invidiously singled out by colleagues.</p> <p>Dishonest gossip, lack of co-operation, unkind looks and sneers, the intolerance of dissent - all are now regarded by many American workplace psychologists as classic symptoms of 'mobbing'. And they are also, of course, all leitmotivs of the Big Brother household.</p> <p>'Big Brother appears to be a microcosm of work, just as work is a microcosm of society,' said Ishmael.</p> <p>'However, quite rightly people at work are starting to see what constitutes bullying and that there are boundaries. They are willing to put their hands up and say to other people this is what you are doing. That's exactly what we are identifying with the participants in Big Brother .'</p> <p>'What the programme also picks up on vividly is an almost adolescent need in these situations for conformity,' said Phillip Hodson of the British Association for Counselling.</p> <p>'It's that terrible fear of whether we're approved of, always worrying does my bum look big in this? So much of it is centred around trust. Do people say one thing to our face and another to our backs? Someone you think you trust is capable of damning you terribly.'</p> <p>In atmospheres like this, it is hardly surprising that victims of workplace bullying take an average extra seven days more off each year than their colleagues who are not bullied, losing 18 million working days a year to Britain's economy.</p> <p>'At its heart it goes to isolation,' said Professor Cooper. 'This sort of environment is all about politics with a small 'p', isolating certain people. They may be a threat to your promotion, or they may be about to discover how incompetent you are.</p> <p>'And you want to ensure that their influence is minimal, so you spread rumours so that their position is undermined.</p> <p>'Sometimes in this environment you will get at someone else by coalescing with a colleague as an ally against the third party to put them down. That goes on in lots of organisations. It may be to undermine them, or perhaps just because you don't like them.'</p> <p>Conflict at work is not new, but some of its current mani festations are certainly a by-product of recent economic change. While 30 years ago jobs were reasonably secure, now organisations dispose of people routinely. We are all expected to work for an organisation, but they don't have to work for us.</p> <p>'In that environment,' says Cooper, 'there is inevitably more politicing, not just for promotion but for survival. Sadly, nowadays there are fewer and fewer people who don't do the back-stabbing.</p> <p>'In a highly competitive world, the group in which we work is getting smaller and smaller. No jobs are for life any more. We have intrinsic insecurity, we're a disposable human asset. We've all become lean and mean.</p> <p>'When we watch Big Brother we're learning lessons at an unconscious level for use in our workplace. Is it any wonder that we're all entranced?'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

And you're sick and tired of the goodlooking smooth-talker from accounts who tells tall tales and whose anti-gay diatribe the other day just confirmed everyone's suspicions that he might have something to hide. It's enough to make you think about giving in your notice. But these tiresome acquaintances are not in your workplace. They are appearing almost nightly on Channel 4's Big Brother, the programme where 10 handsome young men and women have been locked up for two months in a house in London's East End, but one is voted out each week. When the show launched with four million viewers, critics assumed it would be sex appeal that guaranteed its audience. In fact, we have been compelled by seeing the chilling way in which a randomly-selected group of people sets about destroying one another under the genteel guise of mutual co-operation. Sounds familiar? It's probably a workplace near you. The most frightening thing about the melodrama being played out in front of the Channel 4 audience - and talked about by millions more than admit to watching the programme - is its alarming similarity to the worlds in which we all live. Home, school, college and most of all work are environments in which we can often identify relatives, friends or colleagues whose apotheosis we now see on our television screens. 'This is the ambulance effect,' explains Professor Cary Cooper, Britain's leading specialist in work relationships. 'You see potential disaster and you want to look. The biggest similarity of all that Big Brother possesses is to a workplace. After all, they are working, even if they don't do much, and also they are competing. 'Work is just like a game; some people get promotion, some people get rejected and some people who don't get promoted will leave. We're learning from Big Brother who is perceived to be worthwhile and who will be retained. 'That's just like the office. People chat at the coffee machine and talk about other people and their relationships. This programme actually allows you not just to hear those sorts of rumours secondhand.' However, in the Big Brother house - like too many workplaces - there is a much more sinister objective lurking beneath much of the residents' conversational veneer. Each is jockeying for someone else to be ditched. Julie Bower might have identified with Sada or Caroline, both now evicted from the house. If Bower had time to watch television. The 35-year old City analyst has been suing Schroder Securities for unfair dismissal. The picture Bower created of her erstwhile employers is one where large numbers of other people - most of them men - appear to have been engaged in undermining her confidence and professional standing while also conspiring to reduce her remuneration package. Her annual bonus was slashed to 'just' \u00a3125,000 while her colleagues, who routinely e-mailed each other unkindly about her, received up to \u00a3425,000. 'Big Brother shows us an environment where people are uncomfortable with their roles,' said Angela Ishmael of the Industrial Society. 'It's exactly what's happening in lots of workplaces. When managers aren't able to manage relationships in a team, team power takes over. It is a classic bullying scenario too, and is becoming more and more common.' 'Nick in Big Brother is marked as dishonest for not being open about plotting to get other people thrown out,' said Ishmael. 'But he is quite genuine in terms of his feelings for his colleagues. 'The simple truth is that he will look after himself more than everyone else. He's just more rehearsed that the rest of them at manipulating people. But Caroline, who clearly isn't liked, will tell everyone exactly how she feels. 'Even though that's quite aggressive, most people can identify with it. The sort of thing Caroline will be accused of is not caring for other people's feelings. The sort of bullying Nick gets involved in is not as confrontational as Caroline's approach, but people do realise afterwards that they are being manipulated. That upsets them.' When replicated in the workplace, it upsets millions of the rest of us too. Earlier this year, the Trades Union Council published research suggesting that almost half of Britain's workforce had 'witnessed' some form of workplace bullying. One in 10 reported being bullied in the previous six months. Thousands of people in Britain are already messaging self-help websites to make complaints about 'mobbing'. The concept, which originated in the United States, does not apply to the classic weak victim of an over-arching superior but to the desperate individual who feels isolated in a working environment after being invidiously singled out by colleagues. Dishonest gossip, lack of co-operation, unkind looks and sneers, the intolerance of dissent - all are now regarded by many American workplace psychologists as classic symptoms of 'mobbing'. And they are also, of course, all leitmotivs of the Big Brother household. 'Big Brother appears to be a microcosm of work, just as work is a microcosm of society,' said Ishmael. 'However, quite rightly people at work are starting to see what constitutes bullying and that there are boundaries. They are willing to put their hands up and say to other people this is what you are doing. That's exactly what we are identifying with the participants in Big Brother .' 'What the programme also picks up on vividly is an almost adolescent need in these situations for conformity,' said Phillip Hodson of the British Association for Counselling. 'It's that terrible fear of whether we're approved of, always worrying does my bum look big in this? So much of it is centred around trust. Do people say one thing to our face and another to our backs? Someone you think you trust is capable of damning you terribly.' In atmospheres like this, it is hardly surprising that victims of workplace bullying take an average extra seven days more off each year than their colleagues who are not bullied, losing 18 million working days a year to Britain's economy. 'At its heart it goes to isolation,' said Professor Cooper. 'This sort of environment is all about politics with a small 'p', isolating certain people. They may be a threat to your promotion, or they may be about to discover how incompetent you are. 'And you want to ensure that their influence is minimal, so you spread rumours so that their position is undermined. 'Sometimes in this environment you will get at someone else by coalescing with a colleague as an ally against the third party to put them down. That goes on in lots of organisations. It may be to undermine them, or perhaps just because you don't like them.' Conflict at work is not new, but some of its current mani festations are certainly a by-product of recent economic change. While 30 years ago jobs were reasonably secure, now organisations dispose of people routinely. We are all expected to work for an organisation, but they don't have to work for us. 'In that environment,' says Cooper, 'there is inevitably more politicing, not just for promotion but for survival. Sadly, nowadays there are fewer and fewer people who don't do the back-stabbing. 'In a highly competitive world, the group in which we work is getting smaller and smaller. No jobs are for life any more. We have intrinsic insecurity, we're a disposable human asset. We've all become lean and mean. 'When we watch Big Brother we're learning lessons at an unconscious level for use in our workplace. Is it any wonder that we're all entranced?' ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk",

Derby Jim Smith has no plans for more big deals before the season starts. 'The key thing this summer was to get the new players integrating - they've settled in well.' Everton Duncan Ferguson should re-sign tomorrow after Newcastle accepted Walter Smith's \u00a33.75m bid. Idan Tal is to arrive after talks with Maccabi Petah Tikva were reopened. Scouts, meanwhile, are watching former Arsenal flop Kaba Diawara - available for \u00a33.5m from Paris St Germain. Ipswich George Burley is set to smash the Ipswich transfer record by paying \u00a35m for Wimbledon's Icelandic defender Hermann Hreidarsson. 'This is the biggest deal in our history,' says an insider. Tottenham's Mauricio Taricco, meanwhile, is chasing a move back to Portman Road. 'I like Ipswich, my baby was born there and my wife likes Ipswich, but at the moment I'm happy at Tottenham. We'll have to wait and see.' Leeds Peter Ridsdale has denied sanctioning a new bid for West Ham's Rio Ferdinand. David O'Leary, meanwhile, has signed a new six-year contract worth \u00a310m. Leicester Peter Taylor is set to make an official approach for highly rated young Leeds keeper Paul Robinson after having another bid for Wigan's Roy Carroll knocked back. 'We need a third choice,' he said. Liverpool Christian Ziege has finally opened talks with Gerard Houllier. 'I've known for a long time that Liverpool and two other clubs had made inquiries for me, but I had to keep quiet until Middlesbrough gave me permission to talk to them,' says Ziege. Eric Meijer's move to Vitesse Arnhem, meanwhile, has broken down. Man City Steve Howey's move to Maine Road won't end City's major spending: 'I've always had it in my mind to sign two centre-backs,' says Joe Royle. The sales will also go on: Robert Taylor will join Portsmouth tomorrow, while Nicky Fenton could join Bournemouth if City accept their \u00a3100,000 bid. Man Utd Alex Ferguson has laughed off reports in Spanish paper AS that he has already bid for Steve McManaman. Posh Spice, meanwhile, has revealed that husband David sings backing vocals on her debut solo single. 'You can't really hear him at first,' she says, 'but you can if you listen.' Middlesbrough Middlesbrough's \u00a38m bid for Ugo Ehiogu could see the player arrive at the Riverside for talks within 24 hours. A massive salary offer for Steve McManaman is also close. Newcastle Bobby Robson is set to blow his Steve Howey and Duncan Ferguson money on another big pre-season signing. Robson has targeted former loan star Helder and PSV's Russian international Yuri Nikiforov. He'll also sanction the cut-price sales of Marcelino, Laurent Charvet, Des Hamilton and Carl Serrant this week. 'These are good professionals and they have a future in the game,' says Robson. 'But not here and not now.' Southampton Glenn Hoddle's deals to sell Hassan Kachloul to Ipswich and Francis Benali to Crystal Palace both collapsed last week. Two other sales could go through this week, to finance a big bid for Leeds' Michael Duberry. Sunderland Portsmouth have refused to meet Peter Reid's \u00a32m valuation of Jody Craddock. 'They've just signed Stanislav Varga, an international captain, for \u00a3650,000 and they're asking almost \u00a32 million for Craddock,' says chairman Milan Mandaric. 'That is just too much.' Tottenham George Graham is set to rival Chelsea's bid for Barcelona's Boudewijn Zenden after the winger's proposed move to Lazio collapsed. Vicenza, meanwhile, are ready to pay \u00a37m for Steffen Iversen. West Ham Harry Redknapp has slammed Leeds after fresh reports of a new \u00a315m offer for Rio Ferdinand. 'The whole situation has just totally pissed me off. The chairman of Leeds is trying to manipulate a deal and I'm getting fed up with it. What are we? A feeder club for Leeds or something?' david.hills@observer.co.uk",

Why, then, is he giving her hand in marriage to Barclays when she is at the lowest point in her fortunes? </p> <p>One of the most striking things about the agreed takeover by Barclays is that the start of the negotiations coincided almost exactly with the fall in Woolwich's share price to an all-time low. The prettiness of which Stewart is so proud is only relative to rivals such as Alliance &amp; Leicester and Abbey National, whose share prices are even more ravaged. </p> <p>Stewart may have managed to persuade Barclays to pay a 45 per cent premium to that all-time low - and to give him the job of deputy chief executive of the combined group - but the 352p offer price is still well below where the shares were trading as recently as March, never mind the peaks it reached a year ago. As far as Woolwich shareholders go, the deal is more like a buffet at the local social club than a wedding breakfast at the Ritz. </p> <p>But that does not mean that Barclays investors are getting a bargain. Its shares have suffered along with the rest of the banking sector, leaving it to commit the City's cardinal sin of using lowly rated paper to take over the Woolwich at a premium price. </p> <p>The obvious conclusion, therefore, is that both Barclays and Woolwich were desperate to find a partner. Barclays was certainly anxious to come up with some good news for its shareholders. It has been dogged by a series of gaffes, and more serious management mistakes, almost constantly since Andrew Buxton sent it headlong into property lending just before the market plunged through the floor. </p> <p>The latest attempt to introduce some stability with the appointment of Matt Barrett, the former head of the Bank of Montreal, as chief executive last year has so far had little success. </p> <p>His arrival was surrounded by controversy immediately as the gossip columns fed on stories of the break-up with his wife Anne-Marie Sten, a former model and mistress of the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. </p> <p>It has been downhill since then. The furore over local branch closures gave way to outrage over his \u00a330 million, five-year salary package - 'I'm worth it,' Barrett told the Government select committee - and anger over the introduction of charges for cash machine withdrawals. </p> <p>Barrett is clearly aware of the impact of the gaffes: he stressed repeatedly at the presentation to announce the deal that Woolwich's cash withdrawals would be free and the closure of 100 branches would be made with due care for the local community. But he clearly felt it was time for some good news. </p> <p>Woolwich's record was less accident-prone but, like all the smaller building societies, it has been the subject of takeover speculation since it joined the stock market three years ago. Its innovative Open Plan service, which puts all a customer's products in one pot, which can be accessed by telephone, at branches or via the internet, has attracted a premium rating, although some analysts suggest that could have been short-lived. </p> <p>Richard Coleman, banking analyst with ABN Amro, believes that Woolwich always needed a bigger partner to develop Open Plan fully. Its own customer base is too small to justify the investment, both in developing and running the product. </p> <p>But it is also too small to finance the investment - both in marketing and in cutting margins - needed to build a big enough customer base. </p> <p>Stewart's decision to sell out to Barclays may have been a tacit admission that he agreed. Certainly, Open Plan was the key attraction for Barclays. Much admired, this service allows customers to amalgamate all their financial products - from mortgages through savings accounts to credit cards - in one account. Interest on deposits is offset against loans to reduce the interest paid. That, of course, is good for the customer. </p> <p>But Barrett's interest is in how it can be good for the bank. Open Plan has been widely available to customers for less than six months but already 290,000 of them have taken it up and Stewart says it is 'well on course' to beat its target of 500,000 accounts by the year-end. More than half those taking it up were new Woolwich customers and, best of all, Open Plan customers hold an average of 3.7 products each. </p> <p>That, in banking terms, is a real result. For decades, bankers have been desperate to get their customers to buy more of their products, but with little success. Even the best do not get above an average of two - and Woolwich says that 70 per cent of its customers have just one product. With competition for new customers intensifying and margins everywhere under pressure, it has become even more important for financial services companies to make money from their existing customers. </p> <p>Barrett had already identified mortgages as one of Barclays key areas of weakness. Mortgages, he says, are a 'vital lifestyle product'. Taking out a mortgage is one of the biggest financial commitments most people will ever make and Barclays is 'determined to be at the table with them', selling them mortgage protection insurance, credit cards and a few unit trusts at the same time. </p> <p>Open Plan makes Woolwich more than just a mortgage book - although Woolwich's 5 per cent market share more than doubles Barclays' exposure to mortgage lending. Barrett is promising \u00a390m of revenue synergies within three years from services such as selling Open Plan to its customers, and offering Woolwich customers products such as its Barclaycard. </p> <p>Will it succeed? Woolwich points out that Open Plan services have transformed the market in Australia, where they are most developed, with half of all new mortgage lending done under this system. </p> <p>But that simply gives ammunition to those who question how long Open Plan will maintain its competitive edge - it is only a matter of time before everyone is offering the same product. </p> <p>Indeed, Halifax is copying Open Plan with its Intelligent Finance offer, which is expected to be launched next month. Royal Bank already offers the service through its joint venture with Virgin and could easily extend it to its own customers. </p> <p>Others advise that Woolwich's figures for the number of products held by Open Plan customers should be treated with caution. Open Plan itself is counted as a product, although it does not directly generate revenue. And many of the customers may open current accounts as part of the deal but never use them: how much profit would that bring to Woolwich or Barclays? </p> <p>Barclays' revenue forecasts add to the suspicions. ABN Amro's Coleman pointed out that the promised revenue benefits amounted to an uplift of less than 1 per cent, compared with what he had been previously expecting.

      "body": "<p>One of the lessons of the Thatcherite legacy was that economic competence is judged not by achievement but by the difference between expectations and achievement. You may not be able to do much about the latter, so it pays to reduce the former. Between 1979 and 1985, British unemployment nearly trebled, yet the government acquired a reputation for competent economic management. The extended infatuation with Tina (There Is No Alternative) as a symbol of the limits of government paid off. </p> <p>The lesson was not lost on New Labour, or not on the Chancellor, at least; his long-running affair with Prudence has done much to dampen the spirits of the Government's natural supporters. The recent spending review reinforces his claim to be the true guardian of fiscal rectitude, but appears to have done little to encourage some significant clients. </p> <p>As Professor Whiteley has argued, a key group whose disappointment may turn to electoral revenge are pensioners. Since 1985 the basic state pension of \u00a367.50 a week (\u00a3108.90 for couples) has been pegged to the retail price index. It is far below both the minimum wage and the Government's minimum income guarantee (MIG), and has fallen steadily behind average earnings. Since inflation is low, this year's increase is only 75p. Yet the basic pension remains the main source of income for most pensioners and the only source (with other state benefits) for 1.3 million of them. </p> <p>Since 1985 the clear message of successive governments has been that it is up to individuals to provide their own retirement income. Any public money that is available is devoted to means-tested safety nets for the very poor, tax incentives for private pensions and savings, plus a few gimmicks such as the free television licence. Further in the future, resources will be diverted to the new Second State Pension, which will cater for those whose earnings are too low to buy a private pension. The hope is that, eventually, private and second-pension entitlements will largely eliminate the need for a pensioners' MIG. </p> <p>Whether by accident or by design, the message seems to have borne fruit. Pensioners' incomes have, on average, risen faster than average earnings over the past 20 years, with a growing proportion coming from occupational pensions and savings. Fewer pensioners are now relying on means-tested benefits. Moreover, Britain is far better placed than other European countries to honour its public pension commitments </p> <p>Why, then, should so many pensioners feel aggrieved? One explanation is that these commitments are more limited than elsewhere in Europe. Another is that income disparities among pensioners have widened. Too many of them remain poor, while the younger and richer ones have done relatively better. </p> <p>What this means, however, is that the newly retired have done so with progressively larger initial pensions, the product of rising employment earnings, longer contribution records and buoyant pension fund performance in the past two decades. Once retired, however, they are unlikely to see any further increase in their real incomes, while their expenses will continue to rise. To that extent they are in the same boat as poorer seniors. </p> <p>The Government's pension reforms are ingeniously designed to boost pensions in the long term and appear to make the best of a bad job without breaking the bank. </p> <p>But, as the Commons Social Security Committee has pointed out, it will take a very long time to lift many more pensioners above the somewhat arbitrary MIG level of \u00a378.45 (\u00a386.05 for the over-eighties), below which means tests are applied. Indeed, many are in danger of falling back because the MIG, linked to average earnings, is likely to rise faster than the basic pension. Because the oldest pensioners are generally the poorest, the committee has proposed that the basic pension for the over-eighties should immediately rise to MIG levels, which would eliminate means tests for many. They do not cost this, but a plausible guess at the net amount might be nearly \u00a31 billion a year. </p> <p>Apart from its obvious benefits, such a move may increase confidence that saving for retirement will not be nullified by means tests. It could also mitigate two of the major uncertainties in planning for retirement - how long you are going to live, and whether you will have to pay for long-term care. </p> <p>An alternative to a selective increase in the pension would be the restoration of a link with average earnings. This would be less costly for five years or so, but the benefit would be more diffuse. It may, however, reduce the numbers falling back below the MIG. </p> <p>In either case, some of the sharp edges of means testing need to be removed. Savings continue to be penalised. This year's Budget improved matters by raising the amount to be disregarded to \u00a36,000, but the system continues to assume that savings above this level earn a 20 per cent return. The rules for assessing contributions to the cost of long-term care similarly discourage such self-reliance. </p> <p>But the broad issue that has to be faced in Britain, as elsewhere, is how to cope with an ageing population. </p> <p>While pensions are the main cost, there are others, such as healthcare and, possibly, labour scarcity. There is no reason to suppose that the country has insufficient income to afford decent pensions. This does not mean the state has to provide pensions for all, but it cannot escape picking up the bill for the poor, and on a larger scale. Tax rises may be necessary to do more than this. If Prudence rules this out, somebody's expectations of the state's contribution to their pension will be disappointed. </p> <p>\u0095 Simon Broadbent is a visiting fellow at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the lessons of the Thatcherite legacy was that economic competence is judged not by achievement but by the difference between expectations and achievement. You may not be able to do much about the latter, so it pays to reduce the former. Between 1979 and 1985, British unemployment nearly trebled, yet the government acquired a reputation for competent economic management. The extended infatuation with Tina (There Is No Alternative) as a symbol of the limits of government paid off. The lesson was not lost on New Labour, or not on the Chancellor, at least; his long-running affair with Prudence has done much to dampen the spirits of the Government's natural supporters. The recent spending review reinforces his claim to be the true guardian of fiscal rectitude, but appears to have done little to encourage some significant clients. As Professor Whiteley has argued, a key group whose disappointment may turn to electoral revenge are pensioners. Since 1985 the basic state pension of \u00a367.50 a week (\u00a3108.90 for couples) has been pegged to the retail price index. It is far below both the minimum wage and the Government's minimum income guarantee (MIG), and has fallen steadily behind average earnings. Since inflation is low, this year's increase is only 75p. Yet the basic pension remains the main source of income for most pensioners and the only source (with other state benefits) for 1.3 million of them. Since 1985 the clear message of successive governments has been that it is up to individuals to provide their own retirement income. Any public money that is available is devoted to means-tested safety nets for the very poor, tax incentives for private pensions and savings, plus a few gimmicks such as the free television licence. Further in the future, resources will be diverted to the new Second State Pension, which will cater for those whose earnings are too low to buy a private pension. The hope is that, eventually, private and second-pension entitlements will largely eliminate the need for a pensioners' MIG. Whether by accident or by design, the message seems to have borne fruit. Pensioners' incomes have, on average, risen faster than average earnings over the past 20 years, with a growing proportion coming from occupational pensions and savings. Fewer pensioners are now relying on means-tested benefits. Moreover, Britain is far better placed than other European countries to honour its public pension commitments Why, then, should so many pensioners feel aggrieved? One explanation is that these commitments are more limited than elsewhere in Europe. Another is that income disparities among pensioners have widened. Too many of them remain poor, while the younger and richer ones have done relatively better. What this means, however, is that the newly retired have done so with progressively larger initial pensions, the product of rising employment earnings, longer contribution records and buoyant pension fund performance in the past two decades. Once retired, however, they are unlikely to see any further increase in their real incomes, while their expenses will continue to rise. To that extent they are in the same boat as poorer seniors. The Government's pension reforms are ingeniously designed to boost pensions in the long term and appear to make the best of a bad job without breaking the bank. But, as the Commons Social Security Committee has pointed out, it will take a very long time to lift many more pensioners above the somewhat arbitrary MIG level of \u00a378.45 (\u00a386.05 for the over-eighties), below which means tests are applied. Indeed, many are in danger of falling back because the MIG, linked to average earnings, is likely to rise faster than the basic pension. Because the oldest pensioners are generally the poorest, the committee has proposed that the basic pension for the over-eighties should immediately rise to MIG levels, which would eliminate means tests for many. They do not cost this, but a plausible guess at the net amount might be nearly \u00a31 billion a year. Apart from its obvious benefits, such a move may increase confidence that saving for retirement will not be nullified by means tests. It could also mitigate two of the major uncertainties in planning for retirement - how long you are going to live, and whether you will have to pay for long-term care. An alternative to a selective increase in the pension would be the restoration of a link with average earnings. This would be less costly for five years or so, but the benefit would be more diffuse. It may, however, reduce the numbers falling back below the MIG. In either case, some of the sharp edges of means testing need to be removed. Savings continue to be penalised. This year's Budget improved matters by raising the amount to be disregarded to \u00a36,000, but the system continues to assume that savings above this level earn a 20 per cent return. The rules for assessing contributions to the cost of long-term care similarly discourage such self-reliance. But the broad issue that has to be faced in Britain, as elsewhere, is how to cope with an ageing population. While pensions are the main cost, there are others, such as healthcare and, possibly, labour scarcity. There is no reason to suppose that the country has insufficient income to afford decent pensions. This does not mean the state has to provide pensions for all, but it cannot escape picking up the bill for the poor, and on a larger scale. Tax rises may be necessary to do more than this. If Prudence rules this out, somebody's expectations of the state's contribution to their pension will be disappointed. \u0095 Simon Broadbent is a visiting fellow at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research.",

A high-rolling lifestyle won't automatically make you destitute. </p> <p>But your psychological profile can have a profound influence on your ability to handle and 'control' money. It defines the risks you are prepared to take and sorts the misers from the spendthrifts. It may help determine your job and how far you make it up the corporate ladder; and therefore how much money you earn. </p> <p>A number of factors can play their part - our childhood and background, even choice of partner. For example, a dominant individual who is financially adept (or appears financially adept) can sometimes inhibit the capabilities of his or her partner. </p> <p>Reckless parents may produce parsimonious children. A sudden windfall may allow us to indulge ourselves - and others - or bring the more distrustful side of our nature to the fore. </p> <p>All of us exert mental control over money to achieve a balance of spending and saving. These controls should also allow us to take more or less risk with our cash given a specific set of circumstances. </p> <p>One person may be unable to maximise their savings because they are so worried about the impact that even low levels of risk may have on their capital. A spendthrift on the other hand may be a risk junky. Neither is particularly healthy. </p> <p>But considering how important money is most of us still think in simple terms - have we got, or have we not got, enough money? </p> <p>Few of us evaluate exactly how we use what we have and whether we have achieved the right balance between the miser and spendthrift that lurks within us all. </p> <p>If our finances are stable and sufficient this may not pose a problem. But if something happens to upset the balance; a misfortune - such as divorce or redundancy - or even good luck, such as a pools or lottery win, our ability to cope may come into question. A major problem is few of us ask for financial help, or we ask for it too late. </p> <p>Talking about money in any detail could be one of the last great taboos. In her book The Real Meaning of Money , psychologist Dorothy Rowe points out that while sex may have come out of the cupboard since Victorian times, we share that generation's prudery when it comes to discussing cash. Victorians forbade any discussion of money within the home. We may ask a friend about their divorce but not their salary. </p> <p>'One of the reasons we are secretive about our own money is that we want to present ourselves to the world as being very sensible and rational about money, but in fact we are not,' said Dr Rowe. </p> <p>The irony is that while most of us will happily sit down and have frank and healthy discussions about the birds and bees with our children, we may find it harder to get to grips with the pounds and the pence. We are more likely to discuss the overdraft and the missed mortgage payments when the children are tucked up in bed. </p> <p> <strong> Spend, spend, spend</strong> </p> <p> Credit and electronic commerce have freed us from the physical constraints once imposed on our money. This may unchain the spendthrift within us. Once you were only as rich as the cash in your pocket. Now we speak in terms of income multiples - I have this, so I can borrow that! And there is a growing range of goods and services for us to consume - from widescreen TVs to exotic holidays. </p> <p>The consumer durable, meanwhile, is being replaced by something more transient; CDs are superseded by MP3s, VHS by DVDs. Household DIY has little to do with maintenance and a great deal to do with fashion and image. Fitted carpets are pass\u00e9; laminate floors the latest thing. You have to spend to keep up and the spendthrift will seize on this as a justification. </p> <p>And all of this consumerism is on very obvious display. No longer are the lives of the 'other half' glimpsed through the keyhole. If anything, older-style affluence with its windy country piles and strict protocols is losing its fascination. You can be rich and make up the rules as you go along. </p> <p>'Despite the theory that we are still a very class-based society there is increasing social mobility,' said social psychologist Professor Michael Argyle. 'The only area that it is very difficult to break into is the very top stratum.' Instead our ability to rise in society depends on a combination of 'achievement, motivation, ability and luck'. </p> <p> <strong> Hoard, hoard, hoard</strong> </p> <p> But not all of us are cut out to be financial wizards - at least, not without help. Debt agencies increasingly have to deal with the fall-out from the new financial order. John McQueen, founder of the Bankruptcy Association, talks about the financial 'naivety' of some people, particularly young people starting their own businesses. </p> <p>'I can think of two young men who got together to run a pub. They were bankrupt in six months, yet they were able to raise the money to get the business off the ground. And the Government is encouraging more people to have a go by promoting the idea of an entrepreneurial society. Not everybody is up to the mark.' </p> <p>Most of the people McQueen sees have started a business, but general insolvency figures show a sharp rise in consumer bankrupts. </p> <p>This new generation of bankrupts may well be rearing children who will err on the side of caution in their financial lives. Bankruptcy and redundancy cut deep into the psyche. Factors such as pensions mis-selling, hyped endowments and stock market crashes add to our doubts and fears about handling cash and may awaken the miser in us. </p> <p>Even the Government exhorting us to take increasing responsibility for our financial welfare and not rely on the state can spook the financially less confident. If we are poor in retirement - for example - it will be our fault and not the state's . Scary stuff. </p> <p>Then consider that money is becoming ever more ephemeral. It is as powerful as it ever was but we see it less and less. Our wages are paid directly into a bank account. We pay for things with credit and debit cards. </p> <p>As we lose physical contact with money our psychological attitude to it becomes even more important. This may well encourage the spendthrift, but the miser's money stuffed under the mattress could turn out to be a perfectly understandable - if extreme - alternative reaction to the cashless society. </p> <p><strong>A bit of Posh - but keeping up with the Beckhams costs you dear </strong></p> <p>What makes some people good with credit cards while others loathe them? Jan Pahl, Professor of Social Policy at the University of Kent and author of a Invisible Money: Family Finance in the Electronic Economy, says human behaviour is complex and how we manage money is determined by a combination of different factors - rarely one alone. The main factors are: </p> <p>\u0095 Rational choice. We make choices that are best for us financially using available information. With the right information we can take charge of our financial well-being.</p> <p>\u0095 Social groups. Different groups have varying access to money. Unemployed people and low-income households, for example, are often excluded from getting credit.</p> <p>\u0095 Psychology. We all carry emotional baggage that affects the way we use money, even what we want from a financial institution. For example, some of us may need a bank that is tough on overdrafts - others may resent it.</p> <p>\u0095 Culture. People give meaning to money above and beyond its basic economic value. It can affect what we buy and the way we buy it. Gold credit cards, for instance,allow people to display their income status.</p> <p>According to Pahl, while education and information about personal finances are presented in terms of rational choice, most people are not rational consumers. 'Beneath all the rationality there is a strong vein of emotion surrounding money, in the form of anxiety, anger, fear, guilt, embarrassment and so on.' These emotions, along with status, age and gender, have to be taken into account when encouraging consumers to make the best decisions.</p> <p>'Keeping up with the Joneses' is a key factor behind financial debt. The worst place to be is in the bottom economic layer of your perceived financial strata, as you spend more to keep up.</p> <p>This is a particular problem for young professionals fresh out of college. If you are a new solicitor in a small practice earning \u00a315,000, for example, you may feel pressure to spend to keep up with colleagues who are earning \u00a325,000. After all, noone wants to be in a position of not being able to stand their round at the pub.</p> <p>We all occasionally spend money to boost our self-image, but in its extreme form people become addicted to shopping - with dire financial consequences. Crowds that throng shopping malls at weekends are not there because of any desperate need. We shop for fun and relaxation. Money is not exclusively tied to the practicalities of life. Even the less well-off use money this way.</p> <p>Psychologists and mail order catalogues have long recognised that the least well-off are prepared to out-spend many better-off families at key events such as Christmas and birthdays.</p> <p>Credit allows us to spend money we haven't got and our relative affluence - or poverty - increasingly comes down to self-control. We now have more to aspire to than ever before.The wealth enjoyed by others, such as Victoria and David Beckham, is displayed for all to see on television and in glossy magazines. Advertising, which uses aspirational lifestyle images, also plays a critical role.</p>",

Here we answer questions for customers and shareholders of both organisations. </p> <p><strong> I'm a Woolwich customer. How will this affect me?</strong><br> Stand by to be offered Barclays products, but stick with the Woolwich. Barclays pays a miserly 0.1 per cent on its current account balances, and charges \u00a35 a month and interest at 18.8 per cent for an overdraft. Woolwich pays 2 per cent on balances, and for overdrafts charges \u00a33.50 a month and 11 per cent interest. </p> <p>Barclaycard customers are charged 19.4 per cent and a \u00a310 fee unless users spend a certain amount. Woolwich's card charges 16.9 per cent, with no fee. </p> <p>Barclays is trumpeting its decision to abolish charges on withdrawals from Woolwich cash machines. But Woolwich had already decided to axe charges for its customers using other machines. The new twist is scrapping the \u00a31 charge levied on withdrawals from free-standing 'convenience' machines. </p> <p> <strong> I'm a Barclays customer. Is there anything in it for me?</strong> </p> <p> You will be offered Woolwich products, including its Open Plan flexible mortgage. You may well get a better deal, but will have to ask for a switch. </p> <p><strong> Will this mean that more bank branches are closed?</strong><br> Yes, 100 will go from the combined group over three years, although Derek French, of the Campaign for Community Banking, says that, even if Woolwich branches were closed, there would be other banks in the same towns. Communities with populations of between 5,000 and 7,000 or less tend to have no banks, but those with larger populations still have six or eight. </p> <p><strong> I'm a Woolwich shareholder. What should I do?</strong><br> Breathe a sigh of relief. Rob Thomas at investment bank UBS Warburg says that, had Woolwich not done this deal, 'the price would have been moving south'. Jeremy Batstone at NatWest Stockbrokers agrees: 'This is a \"get out of jail free card\".' </p> <p>Woolwich shareholders will receive 0.1175 new Barclays shares and \u00a31.64 for each Woolwich share. They will keep their interim dividend of 4.4p a share, al-though Barclays' interim dividend of 20p is not included. The offer valued Woolwich shares on confirmation of the deal at 352p, compared with the 296p at which they started trading when the company joined the Stock Exchange in July 1997. </p> <p><strong> I don't want Barclays shares. What can I do?</strong><br> An Observer reader reacted angrily on Friday to the deal, because it does not have a straightforward cash-only option for Woolwich shareholders. Others may share his view. Investors can ask for all cash, but only a certain amount of the purchase price will be set aside for cash, so the chances of getting a full cash payment are probably slim. There will be a special dealing service for selling the Barclays shares. </p> <p>John Spiers of adviser Best Investment said this type of deal was not particularly desirable for small investors as many did not want small parcels of shares and the continual selling of small holdings would depress the Barclays price. </p> <p>Batstone says the main issue for Woolwich shareholder is whether to keep their shares for the Barclays payout later this year - when the price may be higher or lower than at present. This will depend on whether you need the money; wealthier investors should consider whether they will pay capital gains tax on their Woolwich holdings. </p> <p><strong> I've got my shares in a Pep. What do I do?</strong><br> Woolwich was hazy about this on Friday, but Pep experts said the share switch should be automatic.</p>",

Others may share his view. Investors can ask for all cash, but only a certain amount of the purchase price will be set aside for cash, so the chances of getting a full cash payment are probably slim. There will be a special dealing service for selling the Barclays shares. John Spiers of adviser Best Investment said this type of deal was not particularly desirable for small investors as many did not want small parcels of shares and the continual selling of small holdings would depress the Barclays price. Batstone says the main issue for Woolwich shareholder is whether to keep their shares for the Barclays payout later this year - when the price may be higher or lower than at present. This will depend on whether you need the money; wealthier investors should consider whether they will pay capital gains tax on their Woolwich holdings. I've got my shares in a Pep. What do I do? Woolwich was hazy about this on Friday, but Pep experts said the share switch should be automatic.",

Everything I created was a result of the civil war.\" </p> <p> Yet for the child of the 1936-39 Spanish civil war, whose books were banned under the victorious Franco regime, liberation came too late. He was living with a Frenchwoman and moving between Paris and his adopted land of Morocco. \"It would have been impossible to have a third life in Spain. I love Spanish culture but hate Spanish society; I can't live there.\" </p> <p> For 45 years, the expatriate Goytisolo has been both widely acknowledged as Spain's greatest living writer and its most scabrous critic. In some 30 books of fiction, autobiography, essays and journalism, he has turned the Spanish language against what he derides as \"Sunnyspain\", flaying the \"Hispanos\" while excavating their culture's Moorish and Jewish roots, suppressed over the centuries. He is passionate about Islamic culture (he speaks Maghrebi Arabic as well as Castilian, Catalan, French, English and Turkish) and castigates European insularity from a vantage point across the Gibraltar straits, siding with pariahs and heretics the world over who have been driven out and glory in a treasonous revenge. </p> <p> His friend, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes, likens Goytisolo to the Irishmen Swift and Joyce: \"exiles condemned to live with the language of their oppressions, digest it, expel it, trample on it, and then resign themselves . . . \" For another admirer, the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, Goytisolo's books are \"unsettling, apocalyptic . . . a strange mixture of pitiless autobiography, the debunking of mythologies and conformist fetishes, passionate exploration of the periphery of the west - in particular the Arab world - and audacious linguistic experiment\". </p> <p> His translator Peter Bush, director of the University of East Anglia's centre for translation studies, believes no other Spanish writer matches his \"intellectual reach, constant invention of language and unusual absorption of other cultures - or stands on a par with the best of the Latin American writers, like M\u00e1rquez and Julio Cort\u00e1zar. Although he writes novels in an avant-garde, provocative, modernist style, there's always a political urgency behind them. His keen sense of history comes from his own life.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo lives in Marrakech, in a beautiful old house in the medina. Now aged 69, a small, rather frail figure, he is an habitue of the Caf\u00e9 de France on the main square of Djemaa el Fna, the pulsing heart of the Moroccan city. Though growing hard of hearing, he revels in its constant drum beats and human murmur which echo in his courtyard, shaded by orange trees. </p> <p> He is known as austere but has a surprising warmth and an impish humour, punning \"Rimbaud\" and \"Rambo\", or laughing at his own incompetence with gadgetry. Young children - the sons of brothers who have worked for him for almost 20 years, play delightedly with a tortoise at his feet. </p> <p> His new book, The Garden Of Secrets, is published next week in English. Hailed by Fuentes as \"one of the very finest novels in Spain of the last 10 years\", it returns to the civil war era that haunts much of Goytisolo's fiction. In 28 tales - one for each letter in the Arabic alphabet - it probes the fate of a fictional friend of Lorca, the great Spanish poet and homosexual, held by the fascists in a north African jail as \"a red, a queer and a poet\". The author's lifelong skewering of Catholic, nationalist Spain has been bound up with his bisexuality and an avowed quest for political, moral and sexual freedom. </p> <p> His masterpiece two-volume autobiography in the mid-1980s, Forbidden Territory and Realm Of Strife, broke ground in Spanish letters with its introspective sexual and emotional honesty. It traces his life up to the mid-1960s, when he ceased to be merely \"a writer of my generation\" producing conventional, neo-realist novels, and struck out on a path of risk and experimentation. </p> <p> The gay US writer Edmund White says: \"Goytisolo made sacrifices for both his literature and his politics. In a culture that now is evolved and permissive, but was then full of macho uptightness, his autobiography brought a note of total frankness. Homosexuality challenges the exploitation of women and role playing, the silences of personal life.\" </p> <p> Guillermo Cabrera Infante, the Cuban novelist, sees his friend as a \"picador: a frank and solitary writer on a crusade for truth. He's pugnaciously honest about his personal life, which is not easy in Spain. He doesn't kow-tow or buy the official line - Franco or post-Franco - and he doesn't belong to any Spanish coterie or club. He's an outsider - his own man.\" </p> <p> Perhaps for that reason, Goytisolo has won none of the country's big literary prizes, and has never been a member of its Royal Academy. He can still shock with a novel such as Carajicomedia (A Cock-eyed Comedy), now in its fifth edition since publication five months ago in Spain; it's a Swiftian satire on the Catholic church and its powerful secret society, Opus Dei. </p> <p> Through his journalism, too, he keeps up an abrasive dialogue with post-Franco Spain. In 1998 he was declared persona non grata by the mayor of the south-eastern boom town of El Ejido for denouncing the conditions of African migrant workers, and is proud to be an \"honorary Gypsy\" for his defence of another embattled community - \"still classified as immigrants after five-and-a-half centuries\". A collection of his roving reports for the Madrid newspaper El Pa\u00eds is due out in translation this autumn. </p> <p> Goytisolo was born in Barcelona in 1931, the third of four children, of \"exemplary bourgeois stock\". His Basque-descended father was an executive in a chemical company, and suffered from pleurisy. The family spent the civil war years in a mountain village in Catalonia, but when Juan was seven his Catalan mother, Julia Gay, was killed in a Francoist air raid during a visit to Barcelona. His father, who hated communists, remained loyal to Franco and was imprisoned by Republicans, the family \"caught in the crossfire of both sides\". </p> <p>After the war, Goytisolo was a \"mixture of orphan and street urchin\". His father forbade his late wife's parents from speaking to them in Catalan. Goytisolo, who writes in Castilian, the official language of Spain, says: \"I only learned Catalan in France in the 60s. But I was always on the periphery of Castilian; I have the freedom of someone not in the centre.\" </p> <p>There were literary antecedents on his mother's side, and his elder brother Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn, who died last year, became a poet; his younger brother Luis, a novelist. When Goytisolo was about eight, he was sexually molested - \"fondled, not raped\" - by his maternal grandfather. Yet more than the trauma, what emerges from his autobiography is compassion for the repressed homosexual grandfather who had been forced out of jobs and was mercilessly humiliated by Juan's virulently homophobic father, who made the penurious old man and his wife move out, though they all dined together every day. </p> <p> \"I'm against pederasty, obviously,\" says Goytisolo. \"I was a child and it was not agreeable to me; my grandfather wasn't responsible for my later sexual life. But in my 20s I assisted in his petty persecution, and it was very cruel. In the end, I felt pity for him.\" </p> <p> His grandmother became senile. \"My mother was killed; her sister and mother died in psychiatric asylums. Recently my brother discovered some beautiful poems my aunt wrote in her 20s. But my family never talked about her. Women were also the victims of this family.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo's belief that Catholic morality spawned his grandparents' \"secret tragedy\" spurred his drive to flee the \"castrating rather than sterile\" values of the Barcelona middle classes His agnosticism, Marxist leanings and sexual ambivalence put him at odds with his father, who was, however, spared the pain of his son's \"coming out\" by his death in 1964. \"I was contrary to all his expectations; he was very Catholic, a monarchist,\" Goytisolo says. \"But I saw a beggar here in Marrakech who had the face of my father when he died, and I was very moved.\" </p> <p> He was schooled by \"ignorant, small-minded Jesuit priests\", so calls himself an autodidact. He studied law in Madrid and Barcelona, and in 1954 published his first novel, The Young Assassins, to acclaim. Repelled by anything Spanish until he was in exile, he read European and American literature. But he soon fled a milieu where he felt alien and hamstrung by self-censorship. He moved to Paris in 1956 and, as a reader for the publishers Gallimard, became a conduit for writers of the Latin American \"boom\", including Fuentes, Cabrera Infante and Manuel Puig. </p> <p> His wife-to-be, Monique Lange, was a secretary for a translation agency who later became a novelist. Lange, who died in 1996, had a four-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, Carole (whose godfather was William Faulkner). The couple began a lifelong \"open\" relationship - each accepting the other's affairs - reminiscent of their friends Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. </p> <p> \"The first time I was in love was with Monique Lange,\" says Goytisolo. \"She was a fantastic woman, open, generous; she understood everything.\" Goytisolo who once described himself as a \"typical progressive intellectual and Communist party fellow-traveller\", wrote fiction influenced by Sartre's theory of social commitment, while filing bitterly anti-Franco reports for French newspapers. He threw himself behind the 1959 Cuban revolution, partly out of guilt at the discovery that his Basque great grandfather had made his fortune from slaves in Cuba. </p> <p> \"As a child I saw many photographs of his sugar plantation, but I was very shocked by the letters from his slaves. It was the beginning of the revolution, and I visited the village where many of the black and mulatto people had my family name. I even met a Juan Goytisolo.\" He last visited Cuba in 1967. \"I discovered the repression against African religions, censorship and persecution of homosexuals; I felt estranged from the revolution after that.\" </p> <p> Cabrera Infante, who met Goytisolo in Paris and travelled with him to Cuba, recalls him as \"very shy and serious - though later I discovered his extraordinary sense of humour and irony\". He tells how Goytisolo was asked to appear on Cuban TV - on condition that he made no mention of his friend, by then on Castro's hate list - but he talked endlessly about Cabrera Infante's novel Three Trapped Tigers. \"He kept his word ,but did what he wanted to do; he has a dispassionate sense of fairness.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo finally broke with the Spanish Communists after predicting that Franco's dictatorship would collapse not through their efforts but through the modernisation of Spain. \"By the mid-60s, 2m Spaniards were emigrating, and 15m tourists came with their customs and freedom: society was changing. I was right, but it was sacrilege. I found myself banished by Francoists in Spain and attacked by the Communist party in exile. I decided not to write about Spanish politics till after Franco's death.\" </p> <p> He knew many writers in Paris, from Camus (\"cold and distant\") to Hemingway, whom he met at a bullfight. But Jean Genet was his mentor - \"moral more than literary\". He says of the playwright who could fit all his belongings in a suitcase: \"He was alien to all kinds of vanity. Because of him, I discovered I was interested in literature, not in literary life. I try to take my work seriously but not myself.\" He quotes Genet: \"If you know your point of arrival, it's not a literary adventure, it's a bus journey.\" </p> <p> Genet may also have been a catalyst for his exploration of bisexuality. Edmund White, Genet's biographer, says: \"Genet was absolutely fearless. When they first met, Genet stared at Goytisolo and said, 'You're a fag, aren't you?'. He represented absolute freedom from middle-class morality and total integrity in art.\" Goytisolo, who loathed \"traditional female passivity\", had been drawn to the bars and brothels of the Barcelona slums of his early fiction, but hankered for dockers. \"My sexuality was never bourgeois or polite,\" he wrote. \"I was never attracted by well brought-up people wearing ties.\" He saw himself as a masked imposter and yearned for authenticity. </p> <p> \"In Barcelona my only sexual education was to go with [women] prostitutes and men of my class,\" he says. \"But it was not satisfactory. In Spain the model of men I find attractive didn't exist then. But in France I found friends in the Arab coffee houses of Barb\u00e8s, where I remember being the only European. I tried to learn Arabic.\" </p> <p> He found his type in the \"rough, sunburned sons\" of the Islamic belt, from Morocco to Pakistan. He and Lange were active supporters of the Algerian independence movement, the FLN, and protested against crackdowns on north Africans in Paris during the Algerian war of 1954-62. In White's view: \"like Genet and Pasolini, Goytisolo is a gay European drawn to the Third World through his erotic tastes but who ... developed that impulse both through political activism and artistic innovation ... [He] is an apostle of the revolutionary, anarchic power of sexuality, of the desiring body, to break through the sterile confines of class.\" </p> <p> In the Islamic world, Goytisolo maintains, \"homosexuality is very natural but it's a condition not to be named\", and is often signalled not by effeminacy but by exaggerated virility. \"I never go to bed with men of Christian origin,\" he adds. \"It's almost impossible, because they've come to an open homosexuality out of a long sickness. I was sick for years, and didn't want to meet people who were also sick.\" </p> <p> He prefers illiterate or less educated men. \"I had homosexual writer friends, but there's a need to be with someone completely different: social difference plays the same role in attraction for me as gender between men and women.\" On the dangers of exploitation, he says: \"There's always a commercial transaction; there's no love, but there's friendship. I love only Monique; I never fell in love with anyone else.\" </p> <p> Lange, who introduced Goytisolo to Genet and found his enigmatic sexuality alluring, is described by White as having been \"totally warm, charming and very French, but painfully shy and with a slightly beaten look\". Goytisolo's first fulfilling gay sex, with an Arab man in Barb\u00e8s, prompted an agonising four-year crisis. It was resolved in 1965 by a moving letter he wrote to Lange (included in his autobiography), in which he confessed to being \"totally, definitively, irrevocably homosexual\". Her response came in a telegram: \"An inhuman week. I still love you.\" </p> <p> From that time Goytisolo lived part of the year in Morocco, often without Lange, and their focus shifted, he wrote, from sex - though they still had a physical relationship - to \"shared values and feelings\". \"That letter to Monique was the most difficult act of my life,\" he recalls. \"I was afraid her reaction would be to cut our ties. But we kept together in a beautiful relationship. She knew there was no possible rivalry between the men I went with and her. I think she was sad, but she took a strong moral position: it was a kind of victory, to establish a new relationship against social prejudice. It was very difficult. But human beings are more complicated than they're supposed to be by society. We tried to live without lies. Most people I know live permanently in lies; many couples exist because they've both hidden many things.\" </p> <p> Lange's novel Les Poissons-chats tells of the heroine's difficult love for a homosexual, and Lange referred to her own husband as \"ever absent\". However, from his point of view, \"it was always with humour and generosity\". </p> <p> In 1978, Lange had a health scare, and they decided to get married. For Goytisolo, the dawn of sexual openness at 34 was a \"rebirth\". \"I felt a free man; suddenly free of ideology, religion, patriotism.\" He broke with realism in the autobiographical Marks Of Identity (1966), which he calls his \"first adult novel\". He disowns his previous eight books. From then, all his works were banned in Spain till Franco's death, but were published in Mexico or Argentina. </p> <p>They have been translated into French, English, German and, increasingly, Arabic; his following extends to Morocco, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. Marks Of Identity, together with Count Julian (1970) and Juan The Landless (1975), formed a trilogy that shocked with its celebration of 700 years of Moorish Spain and hybrid culture. Count Julian was once described as a \"poison pen letter to Spanish society\", because it sent up the Catholic cult of virginity. It also attacks Spain's obsession with \"purity\", which includes denying the Arabic influence on the Spanish language. The book was conceived in Tangier and reveals the subconscious Spanish terror of the Moor. Goytisolo says: \"for centuries Spain was a frontier between the Christian and Islamic worlds; anti-Muslim sentiments are very profound. When I was a child, people would say, 'Be quiet, the Moro is coming',. I felt completely foreign to my country. I imagined the destruction of Spanish mythology, its Catholicism and nationalism, in a literary attack on traditional Spain. I identified myself with the great traitor who opened the door to Arab invasion. I discovered that the Franco dictatorship was the result of a long tradition that began in the middle ages.\" </p> <p> For Goytisolo, the first modern totalitarian state came with the Catholic monarchy's support for the Inquisition and the later expulsion of Spanish Muslims in 1609. Spain's destruction of its plural culture was the downfall of that state, bringing with it intellectual sterility and delayed modernity - its \"long holiday from history\". </p> <p> He says: \"The vitality of a culture is in its capacity to assimilate foreign influences. The culture that's defensive and closed condemns itself to decadence.\" Goytisolo in exile has re-read the Spanish classics he once spurned. \"I've spent almost all my adult life outside Spain. I compensate by trying to live inside Spanish culture. Everything I wrote after Count Julian was a dialogue with Spanish literature. I know many writers who want disciples, imitators. But I'm looking for ancestors.\" </p> <p> His eclectic family tree includes the Archpriest of Hita, a 12th-century \"Boccaccio or Chaucer\" who mixed Latin, Hebrew, Arabic and Castilian; the mystic St John of the Cross; the Sufi poets; and the picaresque novelists. For him, the Spanish canon has been \"brutally savaged\" by persistent taboos, such as refusing to admit that Cervantes might have been a \"new Christian\" - a Jewish convert during the Inquisition. \"If you don't take into account the Jewish origins of most writers of the 15th to 17th centuries, you don't understand the drama: it was the first confrontation of intellectuals against a totalitarian state. It's like teaching 20th-century Russian literature as a Golden Age, without mentioning the Gulag.\" </p> <p> Nor is the Arabic role acknowledged in the origins of the European novel - he cites Cervantes, who was held captive in Algiers, drawing on the Thousand and One Nights: \"Kundera was right to say the modern novel began with Cervantes. Don Quixote combined the western and Arabic traditions.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo calls The Garden Of Secrets a homage to Cervantes. He learned that many civil war poets were gay - Lorca and friends on the Republican side, and closet homosexuals among the Falangists, Franco's fascists, who \"wrote very bad poetry about the German army and the Aryan ideal\". Yet while Franco's side was virulently anti-semitic, its Moorish mercenaries from the Rif were attacked by the other side, the Republicans. </p> <p> \"They weren't able to distinguish between the Moroccan people and poor mercenaries who need to eat. I'm not nostalgic or idealistic; there was always conflict between Jews, Arabs and Christians in Andalucia. But the problem is, they said you can't be Spanish without being Catholic. Always, those who don't speak like you are 'foreigners' who need to be expelled.\" </p> <p> When Goytisolo much later returned to Almeria province in southern Spain, where the poverty had shocked him in the 1950s, he found an agricultural miracle fuelled by north African migrants. He likened their conditions to those of Cuban slaves, prompting him to predict today's renewed cries of \"Moors out!\". He despairs of post-Franco Spain - as newly rich, newly free and newly European. \"After the treatment of immigrants and Gypsies, I feel the same way about Spain as I did in Tangier. The problem is the incapacity to embrace the richness it contains.\" The same goes for \"Fortress Europe\". Seeing Turkish graffiti in Le Sentier, the Paris garment district where he lived with Lange, Goytisolo's impulse was to take up Turkish classes. </p> <p> \"When I was a child in the 40s, the Catalan language was forbidden. I realised that to have two languages and cultures is better than one; three better than two. You should always add, not subtract. I've tried to be a kind of European with a knowledge of other areas of the world.\" He revels in the polyphony, diversity, healthful promiscuity and \"reciprocal contagion\" of cityscapes, which he celebrated in his novels Makbara (1980) - a hymn to sex as freedom - and the darkly funny Landscapes After The Battle (1982). For him, an \"urban animal\", the \"Babelisation of great capitals\" is a sign of modernity. </p> <p> In The Virtues Of The Solitary Bird (1988), the terror of Aids merges with a wider fear of contamination - to \"not being of pure blood, pure Christian; being infected by a foreign or alien ideology\". He sees Spain's expulsions of Jews and Muslims as a precursor of today's ethnic cleansing, by the likes of Radovan Karadzic in Bosnia and Jean-Marie Le Pen in France. During the Bosnian war, he wrote of the targeting of Sarajevo's library by ultra-nationalist Serbs, who echoed the Spanish fascists of the 1940s, as \"memoricide: thousands of Ottoman, Persian, Arabic manuscripts were destroyed to kill memories and construct a new mythology\". </p> <p> In a lecture in Oxford, entitled \"We are all Bosnians\", he called for intervention. Where, he asked, were the Hemingways and Orwells to defend secular citizenship - \"the most important part of the French revolution? I was convinced that after the second world war and the Holocaust some things were impossible in Europe. But I discovered in Yugoslavia that my conviction was wrong; everything is possible.\" </p> <p> Since his wife's death four years ago, Goytisolo has lived in Marrakech. \"She died suddenly in her sleep. For her it was wonderful, there was no pain. But I wasn't prepared. It was very difficult for me to get used to living in Paris without her; I got depressed. My apartment became a kind of tomb.\" </p> <p> He has created an unorthodox household with his friends the Darouzi brothers (\"not a sexual relationship; it's family\"), and their sons, eight-year-old Rida, and his younger cousins, Younes and Khalid - who he has made his heirs. </p> <p> He also heads a Unesco drive to have Marrakech's Djemaa el Fna, where he learned his colloquial Arabic, designated as the world's first \"oral heritage\" site. Scornful of the \"educated but uncultured\" Moroccan bourgeoisie who look down on the low-life spinning fabulous tales on the square, he gleams with uncondescending pleasure at the paradox: \"The illiterate storytellers were my professors.\" </p> <p> The Garden Of Secrets is published on Thursday by Serpent's Tail, at \u00a314.99. Juan Goytisolo will be at the Edinburgh book festival on Saturday August 26 at 3.30pm.</p>",

In 1998 he was declared persona non grata by the mayor of the south-eastern boom town of El Ejido for denouncing the conditions of African migrant workers, and is proud to be an \"honorary Gypsy\" for his defence of another embattled community - \"still classified as immigrants after five-and-a-half centuries\". A collection of his roving reports for the Madrid newspaper El Pa\u00eds is due out in translation this autumn. Goytisolo was born in Barcelona in 1931, the third of four children, of \"exemplary bourgeois stock\". His Basque-descended father was an executive in a chemical company, and suffered from pleurisy. The family spent the civil war years in a mountain village in Catalonia, but when Juan was seven his Catalan mother, Julia Gay, was killed in a Francoist air raid during a visit to Barcelona. His father, who hated communists, remained loyal to Franco and was imprisoned by Republicans, the family \"caught in the crossfire of both sides\". After the war, Goytisolo was a \"mixture of orphan and street urchin\". His father forbade his late wife's parents from speaking to them in Catalan. Goytisolo, who writes in Castilian, the official language of Spain, says: \"I only learned Catalan in France in the 60s. But I was always on the periphery of Castilian; I have the freedom of someone not in the centre.\" There were literary antecedents on his mother's side, and his elder brother Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn, who died last year, became a poet; his younger brother Luis, a novelist. When Goytisolo was about eight, he was sexually molested - \"fondled, not raped\" - by his maternal grandfather. Yet more than the trauma, what emerges from his autobiography is compassion for the repressed homosexual grandfather who had been forced out of jobs and was mercilessly humiliated by Juan's virulently homophobic father, who made the penurious old man and his wife move out, though they all dined together every day. \"I'm against pederasty, obviously,\" says Goytisolo. \"I was a child and it was not agreeable to me; my grandfather wasn't responsible for my later sexual life. But in my 20s I assisted in his petty persecution, and it was very cruel. In the end, I felt pity for him.\" His grandmother became senile. \"My mother was killed; her sister and mother died in psychiatric asylums. Recently my brother discovered some beautiful poems my aunt wrote in her 20s. But my family never talked about her. Women were also the victims of this family.\" Goytisolo's belief that Catholic morality spawned his grandparents' \"secret tragedy\" spurred his drive to flee the \"castrating rather than sterile\" values of the Barcelona middle classes His agnosticism, Marxist leanings and sexual ambivalence put him at odds with his father, who was, however, spared the pain of his son's \"coming out\" by his death in 1964. \"I was contrary to all his expectations; he was very Catholic, a monarchist,\" Goytisolo says. \"But I saw a beggar here in Marrakech who had the face of my father when he died, and I was very moved.\" He was schooled by \"ignorant, small-minded Jesuit priests\", so calls himself an autodidact. He studied law in Madrid and Barcelona, and in 1954 published his first novel, The Young Assassins, to acclaim. Repelled by anything Spanish until he was in exile, he read European and American literature. But he soon fled a milieu where he felt alien and hamstrung by self-censorship. He moved to Paris in 1956 and, as a reader for the publishers Gallimard, became a conduit for writers of the Latin American \"boom\", including Fuentes, Cabrera Infante and Manuel Puig. His wife-to-be, Monique Lange, was a secretary for a translation agency who later became a novelist. Lange, who died in 1996, had a four-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, Carole (whose godfather was William Faulkner). The couple began a lifelong \"open\" relationship - each accepting the other's affairs - reminiscent of their friends Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. \"The first time I was in love was with Monique Lange,\" says Goytisolo. \"She was a fantastic woman, open, generous; she understood everything.\" Goytisolo who once described himself as a \"typical progressive intellectual and Communist party fellow-traveller\", wrote fiction influenced by Sartre's theory of social commitment, while filing bitterly anti-Franco reports for French newspapers. He threw himself behind the 1959 Cuban revolution, partly out of guilt at the discovery that his Basque great grandfather had made his fortune from slaves in Cuba. \"As a child I saw many photographs of his sugar plantation, but I was very shocked by the letters from his slaves. It was the beginning of the revolution, and I visited the village where many of the black and mulatto people had my family name. I even met a Juan Goytisolo.\" He last visited Cuba in 1967. \"I discovered the repression against African religions, censorship and persecution of homosexuals; I felt estranged from the revolution after that.\" Cabrera Infante, who met Goytisolo in Paris and travelled with him to Cuba, recalls him as \"very shy and serious - though later I discovered his extraordinary sense of humour and irony\". He tells how Goytisolo was asked to appear on Cuban TV - on condition that he made no mention of his friend, by then on Castro's hate list - but he talked endlessly about Cabrera Infante's novel Three Trapped Tigers. \"He kept his word ,but did what he wanted to do; he has a dispassionate sense of fairness.\" Goytisolo finally broke with the Spanish Communists after predicting that Franco's dictatorship would collapse not through their efforts but through the modernisation of Spain. \"By the mid-60s, 2m Spaniards were emigrating, and 15m tourists came with their customs and freedom: society was changing. I was right, but it was sacrilege. I found myself banished by Francoists in Spain and attacked by the Communist party in exile. I decided not to write about Spanish politics till after Franco's death.\" He knew many writers in Paris, from Camus (\"cold and distant\") to Hemingway, whom he met at a bullfight. But Jean Genet was his mentor - \"moral more than literary\". He says of the playwright who could fit all his belongings in a suitcase: \"He was alien to all kinds of vanity. Because of him, I discovered I was interested in literature, not in literary life. I try to take my work seriously but not myself.\" He quotes Genet: \"If you know your point of arrival, it's not a literary adventure, it's a bus journey.\" Genet may also have been a catalyst for his exploration of bisexuality. Edmund White, Genet's biographer, says: \"Genet was absolutely fearless. When they first met, Genet stared at Goytisolo and said, 'You're a fag, aren't you?'. He represented absolute freedom from middle-class morality and total integrity in art.\" Goytisolo, who loathed \"traditional female passivity\", had been drawn to the bars and brothels of the Barcelona slums of his early fiction, but hankered for dockers. \"My sexuality was never bourgeois or polite,\" he wrote. \"I was never attracted by well brought-up people wearing ties.\" He saw himself as a masked imposter and yearned for authenticity. \"In Barcelona my only sexual education was to go with [women] prostitutes and men of my class,\" he says. \"But it was not satisfactory. In Spain the model of men I find attractive didn't exist then. But in France I found friends in the Arab coffee houses of Barb\u00e8s, where I remember being the only European. I tried to learn Arabic.\" He found his type in the \"rough, sunburned sons\" of the Islamic belt, from Morocco to Pakistan. He and Lange were active supporters of the Algerian independence movement, the FLN, and protested against crackdowns on north Africans in Paris during the Algerian war of 1954-62. In White's view: \"like Genet and Pasolini, Goytisolo is a gay European drawn to the Third World through his erotic tastes but who ... developed that impulse both through political activism and artistic innovation ... [He] is an apostle of the revolutionary, anarchic power of sexuality, of the desiring body, to break through the sterile confines of class.\" In the Islamic world, Goytisolo maintains, \"homosexuality is very natural but it's a condition not to be named\", and is often signalled not by effeminacy but by exaggerated virility. \"I never go to bed with men of Christian origin,\" he adds. \"It's almost impossible, because they've come to an open homosexuality out of a long sickness. I was sick for years, and didn't want to meet people who were also sick.\" He prefers illiterate or less educated men. \"I had homosexual writer friends, but there's a need to be with someone completely different: social difference plays the same role in attraction for me as gender between men and women.\" On the dangers of exploitation, he says: \"There's always a commercial transaction; there's no love, but there's friendship. I love only Monique; I never fell in love with anyone else.\" Lange, who introduced Goytisolo to Genet and found his enigmatic sexuality alluring, is described by White as having been \"totally warm, charming and very French, but painfully shy and with a slightly beaten look\". Goytisolo's first fulfilling gay sex, with an Arab man in Barb\u00e8s, prompted an agonising four-year crisis. It was resolved in 1965 by a moving letter he wrote to Lange (included in his autobiography), in which he confessed to being \"totally, definitively, irrevocably homosexual\". Her response came in a telegram: \"An inhuman week. I still love you.\" From that time Goytisolo lived part of the year in Morocco, often without Lange, and their focus shifted, he wrote, from sex - though they still had a physical relationship - to \"shared values and feelings\". \"That letter to Monique was the most difficult act of my life,\" he recalls. \"I was afraid her reaction would be to cut our ties. But we kept together in a beautiful relationship. She knew there was no possible rivalry between the men I went with and her. I think she was sad, but she took a strong moral position: it was a kind of victory, to establish a new relationship against social prejudice. It was very difficult. But human beings are more complicated than they're supposed to be by society. We tried to live without lies. Most people I know live permanently in lies; many couples exist because they've both hidden many things.\" Lange's novel Les Poissons-chats tells of the heroine's difficult love for a homosexual, and Lange referred to her own husband as \"ever absent\". However, from his point of view, \"it was always with humour and generosity\". In 1978, Lange had a health scare, and they decided to get married. For Goytisolo, the dawn of sexual openness at 34 was a \"rebirth\". \"I felt a free man; suddenly free of ideology, religion, patriotism.\" He broke with realism in the autobiographical Marks Of Identity (1966), which he calls his \"first adult novel\". He disowns his previous eight books. From then, all his works were banned in Spain till Franco's death, but were published in Mexico or Argentina. They have been translated into French, English, German and, increasingly, Arabic; his following extends to Morocco, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. Marks Of Identity, together with Count Julian (1970) and Juan The Landless (1975), formed a trilogy that shocked with its celebration of 700 years of Moorish Spain and hybrid culture. Count Julian was once described as a \"poison pen letter to Spanish society\", because it sent up the Catholic cult of virginity. It also attacks Spain's obsession with \"purity\", which includes denying the Arabic influence on the Spanish language. The book was conceived in Tangier and reveals the subconscious Spanish terror of the Moor. Goytisolo says: \"for centuries Spain was a frontier between the Christian and Islamic worlds; anti-Muslim sentiments are very profound. When I was a child, people would say, 'Be quiet, the Moro is coming',. I felt completely foreign to my country. I imagined the destruction of Spanish mythology, its Catholicism and nationalism, in a literary attack on traditional Spain. I identified myself with the great traitor who opened the door to Arab invasion. I discovered that the Franco dictatorship was the result of a long tradition that began in the middle ages.\" For Goytisolo, the first modern totalitarian state came with the Catholic monarchy's support for the Inquisition and the later expulsion of Spanish Muslims in 1609. Spain's destruction of its plural culture was the downfall of that state, bringing with it intellectual sterility and delayed modernity - its \"long holiday from history\". He says: \"The vitality of a culture is in its capacity to assimilate foreign influences. The culture that's defensive and closed condemns itself to decadence.\" Goytisolo in exile has re-read the Spanish classics he once spurned. \"I've spent almost all my adult life outside Spain. I compensate by trying to live inside Spanish culture. Everything I wrote after Count Julian was a dialogue with Spanish literature. I know many writers who want disciples, imitators. But I'm looking for ancestors.\" His eclectic family tree includes the Archpriest of Hita, a 12th-century \"Boccaccio or Chaucer\" who mixed Latin, Hebrew, Arabic and Castilian; the mystic St John of the Cross; the Sufi poets; and the picaresque novelists. For him, the Spanish canon has been \"brutally savaged\" by persistent taboos, such as refusing to admit that Cervantes might have been a \"new Christian\" - a Jewish convert during the Inquisition. \"If you don't take into account the Jewish origins of most writers of the 15th to 17th centuries, you don't understand the drama: it was the first confrontation of intellectuals against a totalitarian state. It's like teaching 20th-century Russian literature as a Golden Age, without mentioning the Gulag.\" Nor is the Arabic role acknowledged in the origins of the European novel - he cites Cervantes, who was held captive in Algiers, drawing on the Thousand and One Nights: \"Kundera was right to say the modern novel began with Cervantes. Don Quixote combined the western and Arabic traditions.\" Goytisolo calls The Garden Of Secrets a homage to Cervantes. He learned that many civil war poets were gay - Lorca and friends on the Republican side, and closet homosexuals among the Falangists, Franco's fascists, who \"wrote very bad poetry about the German army and the Aryan ideal\". Yet while Franco's side was virulently anti-semitic, its Moorish mercenaries from the Rif were attacked by the other side, the Republicans. \"They weren't able to distinguish between the Moroccan people and poor mercenaries who need to eat. I'm not nostalgic or idealistic; there was always conflict between Jews, Arabs and Christians in Andalucia. But the problem is, they said you can't be Spanish without being Catholic. Always, those who don't speak like you are 'foreigners' who need to be expelled.\" When Goytisolo much later returned to Almeria province in southern Spain, where the poverty had shocked him in the 1950s, he found an agricultural miracle fuelled by north African migrants. He likened their conditions to those of Cuban slaves, prompting him to predict today's renewed cries of \"Moors out!\". He despairs of post-Franco Spain - as newly rich, newly free and newly European. \"After the treatment of immigrants and Gypsies, I feel the same way about Spain as I did in Tangier. The problem is the incapacity to embrace the richness it contains.\" The same goes for \"Fortress Europe\". Seeing Turkish graffiti in Le Sentier, the Paris garment district where he lived with Lange, Goytisolo's impulse was to take up Turkish classes. \"When I was a child in the 40s, the Catalan language was forbidden. I realised that to have two languages and cultures is better than one; three better than two. You should always add, not subtract. I've tried to be a kind of European with a knowledge of other areas of the world.\" He revels in the polyphony, diversity, healthful promiscuity and \"reciprocal contagion\" of cityscapes, which he celebrated in his novels Makbara (1980) - a hymn to sex as freedom - and the darkly funny Landscapes After The Battle (1982). For him, an \"urban animal\", the \"Babelisation of great capitals\" is a sign of modernity. In The Virtues Of The Solitary Bird (1988), the terror of Aids merges with a wider fear of contamination - to \"not being of pure blood, pure Christian; being infected by a foreign or alien ideology\". He sees Spain's expulsions of Jews and Muslims as a precursor of today's ethnic cleansing, by the likes of Radovan Karadzic in Bosnia and Jean-Marie Le Pen in France. During the Bosnian war, he wrote of the targeting of Sarajevo's library by ultra-nationalist Serbs, who echoed the Spanish fascists of the 1940s, as \"memoricide: thousands of Ottoman, Persian, Arabic manuscripts were destroyed to kill memories and construct a new mythology\". In a lecture in Oxford, entitled \"We are all Bosnians\", he called for intervention. Where, he asked, were the Hemingways and Orwells to defend secular citizenship - \"the most important part of the French revolution? I was convinced that after the second world war and the Holocaust some things were impossible in Europe. But I discovered in Yugoslavia that my conviction was wrong; everything is possible.\" Since his wife's death four years ago, Goytisolo has lived in Marrakech. \"She died suddenly in her sleep. For her it was wonderful, there was no pain. But I wasn't prepared. It was very difficult for me to get used to living in Paris without her; I got depressed. My apartment became a kind of tomb.\" He has created an unorthodox household with his friends the Darouzi brothers (\"not a sexual relationship; it's family\"), and their sons, eight-year-old Rida, and his younger cousins, Younes and Khalid - who he has made his heirs. He also heads a Unesco drive to have Marrakech's Djemaa el Fna, where he learned his colloquial Arabic, designated as the world's first \"oral heritage\" site. Scornful of the \"educated but uncultured\" Moroccan bourgeoisie who look down on the low-life spinning fabulous tales on the square, he gleams with uncondescending pleasure at the paradox: \"The illiterate storytellers were my professors.\" The Garden Of Secrets is published on Thursday by Serpent's Tail, at \u00a314.99. Juan Goytisolo will be at the Edinburgh book festival on Saturday August 26 at 3.30pm.",

      "body": "<p>Her room has been left untouched since they found her. A few clothes are strewn over the floor. There are empty boxes of camera film, some Pantene shampoo and the stub of a candle.</p> <p>Before her brutal murder in the early hours of Thursday morning, Kirsty Jones had been living just as thousands of other young backpackers in Thailand do - roughly, cheaply, messily - and with little regard to what the future might bring.</p> <p>She arrived at the Aree guesthouse in the hill resort of Chiang Mai, 400 miles north of Bangkok, on August 4. With its billiard table, bar and flourishing pot plants - and the portrait of Thailand's king and queen hung reverentially in front of the downstairs bedrooms - the guesthouse must have seemed a congenial place to hang out.</p> <p>The owner offered Thai massage lessons in an upstairs room via a rickety staircase. Rooms were cheap - \u00a31 a night for a single - though small and rather grubby. The Aree fails to make it into the Lonely Planet guide to Thailand. But it boasts a small but pleasant courtyard where you can eat under the stars, enjoy the evening breeze and try to ignore the kittens mewing at your feet.</p> <p>For Kirsty, who had already spent three months in Thailand en route to Australia, it was as good a place as any to relax. Kirsty got chatting to another British backpacker, Nathan Foley. They hit it off. She, like him, was travelling on her own. \"She was just bubbly. She was happy and cheeful and loved to talk,\" he said yesterday. \"She was having a great time.\"</p> <p>Another British traveller, Sarah Wiggett, also formed part of the group. The three would eat in the evenings at a local bakery, and then pop in for a pint at an Irish bar nearby.</p> <p>Two days after arriving at the guesthouse, Kirsty set off again for a three-day trek in the hills which surround Chiang Mai, and are a favourite tourist destination. She took photographs of elephants. Another shot captures her slogging through lush jungle. The photos were recovered from her rucksack. There are also earlier pictures of her posing on the beach in southern Thailand in a bikini and larking around in a wetsuit. Put together, they form an eloquent chronicle of her final days.</p> <p>Within hours of her return to Chiang Mai, Kirsty was dead. There are few facts. On Wednesday evening, she, Nathan and Sarah had dinner together in a Thai restaurant. According to Nathan, he then returned to the guesthouse to try to phone his girlfriend in Spain. Kirsty and Sarah wandered around Chiang Mai's night bazaar, a line of illuminated open air stalls selling ethnic clothing and jewellery not far from the ancient city's crumbling walls and moats.</p> <p>At 11.30pm Sarah went back to her guesthouse. It is not clear when Kirsty returned to the Aree - or whether she was alone.

      "bodyText": "Her room has been left untouched since they found her. A few clothes are strewn over the floor. There are empty boxes of camera film, some Pantene shampoo and the stub of a candle. Before her brutal murder in the early hours of Thursday morning, Kirsty Jones had been living just as thousands of other young backpackers in Thailand do - roughly, cheaply, messily - and with little regard to what the future might bring. She arrived at the Aree guesthouse in the hill resort of Chiang Mai, 400 miles north of Bangkok, on August 4. With its billiard table, bar and flourishing pot plants - and the portrait of Thailand's king and queen hung reverentially in front of the downstairs bedrooms - the guesthouse must have seemed a congenial place to hang out. The owner offered Thai massage lessons in an upstairs room via a rickety staircase. Rooms were cheap - \u00a31 a night for a single - though small and rather grubby. The Aree fails to make it into the Lonely Planet guide to Thailand. But it boasts a small but pleasant courtyard where you can eat under the stars, enjoy the evening breeze and try to ignore the kittens mewing at your feet. For Kirsty, who had already spent three months in Thailand en route to Australia, it was as good a place as any to relax. Kirsty got chatting to another British backpacker, Nathan Foley. They hit it off. She, like him, was travelling on her own. \"She was just bubbly. She was happy and cheeful and loved to talk,\" he said yesterday. \"She was having a great time.\" Another British traveller, Sarah Wiggett, also formed part of the group. The three would eat in the evenings at a local bakery, and then pop in for a pint at an Irish bar nearby. Two days after arriving at the guesthouse, Kirsty set off again for a three-day trek in the hills which surround Chiang Mai, and are a favourite tourist destination. She took photographs of elephants. Another shot captures her slogging through lush jungle. The photos were recovered from her rucksack. There are also earlier pictures of her posing on the beach in southern Thailand in a bikini and larking around in a wetsuit. Put together, they form an eloquent chronicle of her final days. Within hours of her return to Chiang Mai, Kirsty was dead. There are few facts. On Wednesday evening, she, Nathan and Sarah had dinner together in a Thai restaurant. According to Nathan, he then returned to the guesthouse to try to phone his girlfriend in Spain. Kirsty and Sarah wandered around Chiang Mai's night bazaar, a line of illuminated open air stalls selling ethnic clothing and jewellery not far from the ancient city's crumbling walls and moats. At 11.30pm Sarah went back to her guesthouse. It is not clear when Kirsty returned to the Aree - or whether she was alone. At 1am on Thursday morning screams could be heard coming from her room. \"I heard 'Get out, get out, get out, leave me alone, leave me alone',\" another British backpacker, Stephen Trigg, 27, said. He and the Aree's Thai manager walked towards where Kirsty was staying in room number four. By the time they arrived the screaming had stopped. And mysteriously, the door was padlocked from the outside. They concluded - wrongly - that Kirsty had been involved in boyfriend trouble. They went back to sleep. In fact she had been raped and murdered. The killer had used Kirsty's deep blue sarong to strangle her. He had left her lying face down on the bed, arms outstretched, and had fled into the night. He had padlocked the door on his way out. The 23-year-old Liverpool University graduate would not be found until 4.30pm on Thursday, more than 12 hours later. By this stage her friends had become worried. \"I had a gut feeling something was wrong. It wasn't like her to disappear like that,\" Mr Foley said yesterday. Mr Foley went voluntarily to the police and was questioned yesterday. Police said last night that he was free to leave, but he chose to stay under their protection. Kirsty's body was discovered by one of the Thai maids at the guesthouse. There were few signs of a struggle. The Thai police arrived shortly afterwards and took her body to a hospital for forensic examination. The British embassy in Bangkok was alerted and frantic attempts were made to contact Kirsty's parents, Sue and Glyn, on holiday in Spain. Her brother Gareth heard about her death on the radio. Throughout most of yesterday, a procession of dazed backpackers was led into a police office where lawyers translated their witness statements into Thai. The investigation is likely to continue for several days. As dusk fell on Chiang Mai last night, other western travellers expressed horror and bemusement at Kirsty's savage murder. \"I'm surprised it happened here because people in Thailand are very polite and friendly,\" Dutch backpacker Wouter Daal said, speaking from one of the city's many internet cafes.

No sign, no movement from behind the curtains, so best press on. There's a lot of coast to see.</p> <p>Guernsey is Jersey's quieter sister. It's smaller, less crowded and not quite so keen on showing off. In a long weekend, you can comfortably see all the island. A slow drive round the coastal roads takes a couple of hours, but the best way to experience the island is on foot or two wheels.</p> <p>The coastal walk begins in Havelet Bay, south of St Peter Port, and follows first the west coast then the south around to Pleinmont tower. Guernsey tilts like a badly-made wedding cake, and the south coast is the thick end of the slice with steep cliffs and secluded bays. The full walk is a challenging 17 miles, but the coast-road bus route is never too far away - those who find it impossible to pass the many beaches or caf\u00e9s without stopping can always cut back and flag down a bus.</p> <p>Beginning with Fermain, each bay appears more beautiful than the last. At Le Jaonnet, the footpath is the only route to the tiny beach, and Petit Bot is stunning. Half-way round at Le Gouffre, the Hollows cliff-top restaurant has an open terrace with a view of the bay and an inviting menu.</p> <p>Originally, the Channel Islands were in the fiefdom of William of Normandy, and some islanders point out that this makes mainland Britain their colony - rather than the other way around. Relationships with France have always been a little fraught, and half-hearted attempts to retake the islands pepper the history books, although the only tangible evidence of a violent past are the reinforced concrete ruins left by the most recent invaders. German forces landed 60 years ago, on June 30 1940. There was no resistance. Many people had already been evacuated to the mainland, and the remaining islanders were made only too aware by London how futile it would be to resist.</p> <p>The result was a very civilised war. Violent incidents were few and, after the D-Day landings, the islanders and the occupying force starved together as food supplies were cut off. </p> <p>In the intervening five years, the Germans must have spent the entire time constructing bunkers.

The house is a testament to his vast ego. His motto \"I Hugo\" is everywhere. Each morning, he used to take a shower on the roof. Presumably his neighbours were very understanding.</p> <p>The nearest of the other Channel Islands is Herm, just over 20 minutes away.

      "body": "<p>Dubrovnik is a fairytale city every bit as magical as Bruges or Venice. The old town looks like a giant Bastille, surrounded by ramparts 2km long and up to 25m high. There is no motorised transport beyond the main entrance, the Pile gate, just a warren of baroque churches and stone houses with honey-coloured roofs.</p> <p>We are lucky that it is still there. Only eight years ago, Dubrovnik was was caught in the crossfire of the Yugoslav civil war, and more than 2,000 shells fell on the old town. Most of the buildings were hit, many burnt out. On the television news bulletins, it looked as if it were being totally destroyed. But a meticulous programme of restoration is underway, and now only occasionally in the back streets do you become aware of any damage. </p> <p>Dubrovnik was a prosperous trading port for nearly 1,000 years, the capital of the Republic of Ragusa, which managed to preserve its wealth and independence while the Byzantine, Venetian and Ottoman empires rose and fell. Most of the buildings were demolished in an earthquake in 1667, but the city was rebuilt and has hardly changed since. </p> <p>The Placa, the broad main boulevard leading to the square and the famous Onofrio fountain, is criss-crossed by thin alleyways. The Franciscan monastery contains one of the oldest apothecary's in Europe, in business since 1391. The Treasury has a priceless collection of gold and silverware dating from the 11th to the 19th century.</p> <p>The republic was finally conquered by Napoleon in 1806. In 1815, it was handed over to Austria and went into a decline.</p> <p>There are no hotels in the old town, but plenty of al-fresco caf\u00e9s where you can sit at sunset and watch the local passagatti down the one street that acts as the entrance and exit to the citadel. </p> <p>The best view of the lot is from the top of the walls. The stairs are next to the Pile gate and are open 7am-7pm. </p> <p><strong>Out of town</strong></p> <p>The Dalmatian coastline is spectacular: a thin edge of pine trees is all that lies between the sea and the limestone-bleached mountains. Although there are no sandy beaches, there are hundreds of coves where you can secretly while away the days. Even in March, with the mimosa and spring flowers in full bloom, the sun can be strong.</p> <p>Drive south to the Konvale valley, a rural farming area tucked within the mountains. One essential would be to call at the small harbourside town of Cavtat, where restaurants and caf\u00e9s line the waterfront.</p> <p>Marco Polo was born on Korcula, about an hour's drive to the north, and a short ferry ride away. The old town is like a mini Dubrovnik, and the home of the world's greatest travel writer is now a museum.

      "bodyText": "Dubrovnik is a fairytale city every bit as magical as Bruges or Venice. The old town looks like a giant Bastille, surrounded by ramparts 2km long and up to 25m high. There is no motorised transport beyond the main entrance, the Pile gate, just a warren of baroque churches and stone houses with honey-coloured roofs. We are lucky that it is still there. Only eight years ago, Dubrovnik was was caught in the crossfire of the Yugoslav civil war, and more than 2,000 shells fell on the old town. Most of the buildings were hit, many burnt out. On the television news bulletins, it looked as if it were being totally destroyed. But a meticulous programme of restoration is underway, and now only occasionally in the back streets do you become aware of any damage. Dubrovnik was a prosperous trading port for nearly 1,000 years, the capital of the Republic of Ragusa, which managed to preserve its wealth and independence while the Byzantine, Venetian and Ottoman empires rose and fell. Most of the buildings were demolished in an earthquake in 1667, but the city was rebuilt and has hardly changed since. The Placa, the broad main boulevard leading to the square and the famous Onofrio fountain, is criss-crossed by thin alleyways. The Franciscan monastery contains one of the oldest apothecary's in Europe, in business since 1391. The Treasury has a priceless collection of gold and silverware dating from the 11th to the 19th century. The republic was finally conquered by Napoleon in 1806. In 1815, it was handed over to Austria and went into a decline. There are no hotels in the old town, but plenty of al-fresco caf\u00e9s where you can sit at sunset and watch the local passagatti down the one street that acts as the entrance and exit to the citadel. The best view of the lot is from the top of the walls. The stairs are next to the Pile gate and are open 7am-7pm. Out of town The Dalmatian coastline is spectacular: a thin edge of pine trees is all that lies between the sea and the limestone-bleached mountains. Although there are no sandy beaches, there are hundreds of coves where you can secretly while away the days. Even in March, with the mimosa and spring flowers in full bloom, the sun can be strong. Drive south to the Konvale valley, a rural farming area tucked within the mountains. One essential would be to call at the small harbourside town of Cavtat, where restaurants and caf\u00e9s line the waterfront. Marco Polo was born on Korcula, about an hour's drive to the north, and a short ferry ride away. The old town is like a mini Dubrovnik, and the home of the world's greatest travel writer is now a museum. More difficult to reach is the island of Mljet with its salt-water lakes surrounded by forest. Driving north, you should visit the botanical gardens and arboretum at Trsteno. Eating out There are plenty of international eateries, especially Italian, but try the local restaurants and caf\u00e9s, known as Konoba, because they will be much cheaper and more fun.

      "body": "<p>The RSC, who've paid my fare, believe I've come to America to play Macbeth at the International Festival of Arts and Ideas at New Haven, Connecticut, but I'm afraid my mind is focused on the holiday afterwards in Massachusetts - whale-watching. We've been doing Macbeth for nine months, in Stratford, London and Tokyo; this is the finish - a doddle.</p> <p>Ah. How wrong I will be. This play doesn't carry a health warning for nothing. A harbour city, New Haven has perversely cut itself off from the water with an ugly tangle of freeways, and presents a rather rough, industrial face. Yet it's also home to Yale University - enclaves of elegant Gothic buildings in spotless rose, cream and honey-coloured brick. The university boasts two art galleries. The Yale University Gallery owns Van Goghs, Picassos, Monets, you name 'em, and - my favourite - a basement full of ancient Mexican figures in flame-red terracotta. </p> <p>Across the road is the Yale Centre for British Art. As part of the Festival (other visitors include the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Swedish Ballet and the Saigon Water Puppet Theatre), it's presenting an Art of Bloomsbury exhibition. Walking round, I happen upon a private tour - well-heeled New Englanders being shown round by a George Burns lookalike in polka-dot bow tie. One bejewelled old dame is so enraptured she marches up to a gallery attendant - \"Say, are these pictures for sale?\" The man gives a spluttering laugh - \"They're from the Tate!\" She doesn't bat an eye - \"Okay, so who do I talk to at the Tate?\"</p> <p>We're performing at the Long Wharf Theatre. One of America's most celebrated regional playhouses, its setting is bizarre. You drive into a sprawling car park. </p> <p>All around are refrigerator trucks, workers in gumboots and shower caps, signs like Lamberti Sausage Inc, Carl's Boned Chicken Inc, and here, among these meat-packing plants, the Long Wharf Theatre. As you gasp at the oddness, there's another surprise. A smell of blood hangs in the air. Especially ripe in the midsummer humidity. As the vegetarians in the company turn green (including our formidable Lady M, Harriet Walter), it occurs to me that this isn't bad preparation for an audience coming to Macbeth - a form of aroma-theatre, though I wouldn't want to do Merry Wives of Windsor here.</p> <p>We open to a rapturous reception. It's very exciting - the whales may yet find this a hard act to follow - till the first Saturday morning when I suddenly wake with no voice. I'm rushed to a specialist who says it's a throat infection that afflicts many visitors to the US, caused by the drastic temperature change from the outside heat to arctic air-conditioning indoors. </p> <p>Fortified with pills and sprays, I'm determined to do that night's performance. But when I open my mouth to say the first line, a rasping nothingness comes out. People onstage later describe it as sounding like The Exorcist, or when you try to shout for help in a nightmare. Which isn't far from the truth. We're forced to stop the show. An announcement is made, my understudy, John Killoran, takes over heroically, and I flee. This would be bad enough at an ordinary performance, but it turns out the top critic in the land is in - Ben Brantley, New York Times. I've just committed professional suicide.</p> <p>I hole up in my hotel room for the next two days. Throughout our run, we've all steadfastly denied The Curse of the Scottish Play. Do I have to admit to it now?</p> <p>No. Brantley shows surprising mercy - for a critic - and returns when I'm back on. He then writes the review that dreams are made of. Next, Greg Doran, our director (and my partner) arrives from England with news that Channel 4 want to film this Macbeth. Cursed? No, no.</p> <p>After the last performance, Greg and I head north to Rockport, Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Rockport is a rather cutesy little summer resort, its original fishermen's cottages converted into gift shops. It's a dry town, but you can bring your own liquor. We're staying at the Yankee Clipper Inn, a lovely group of silvery-grey clapboard houses on a great lawn that slopes down to the sea. Our room has a vast, sun-filled sea view. After nine months in the heart of darkness, this is perfect.</p> <p>Three miles away is the fishing port of Gloucester, a grittier, saltier place, everything rusty, peeling at the edges. The Whale Center of New England is based here. We've secured places on its small research vessel (you make a special application for these), but that's two days away - meanwhile, we take a trip with one of the big tourist whale-watching outfits, Captain Bill's.</p> <p>In fact, they're linked to the Whale Center, and its director Mason Weinrich happens to be the guide onboard today's crowded, two-decked catamaran. Having read about him in Mark Carwardine's On the Trail of the Whale (an excellent handbook to whale-watching round the world), I'd pictured him as a weathered old character, part scientist, part fisherman. Instead, he's more like someone from a Californian rock band: a tall, handsome figure with jet black hair, beard and shades, pacing round the deck with a cordless mike. </p> <p>It takes two hours to reach Stellwagen Bank, the underwater plateau whose rich feeding grounds attract large numbers of humpback, fin and minke whales. Suddenly an intensely black shape breaks the vast blueness of the scene. The ship changes course and picks up speed. \"Humpbacks . . . a mother and calf,\" Mason says into his mike. \"It's... yes... Scratch and Stout.\" </p> <p>Mason is doing three jobs at once: training an intern at his side, calling out directions to the ship's captain, and explaining whale behaviour to us, his mesmerised audience of tourists. Scratch is teaching Stout to kick-feed. This involves whacking the tail on the surface above a shoal of fish, and then diving open-mouthed into their stunned midst. On each dive you see a powerful arching of the spine (this put the \"hump\" in \"humpback\"), and then the tail lifts, showing the white markings underneath - the identifying feature of each whale - in a manner that is infinitely graceful and rather sexy. It's like a lady lowering a fan for a long, slow moment. Look, this is who I am. </p> <p>Now Stout swims towards the ship, dives under it and surfaces directly below our deck. Her long, white flippers show first, two turquoise wings in the dark water, then there's the gradual revelation of her enormous body - this is only a calf! - colossal yet weightless, slowly rising into view like a kind of dream. I glance at Greg. His eyes are full. So are mine.</p> <p>In between whale expeditions, we visit nearby Salem, site of the notorious witch trials of 1692. We're hoping for some penetrating insights into the supernatural, perhaps providing new material for our TV Macbeth, but the town is like a theme park with the Witch Dungeon Museum, the Crypt Caf\u00e9, Fatima's Psychic Studio and so on, every establishment fronted by people in amateurish period costumes. We flee.</p> <p>I'm both excited and apprehensive about our day on the whale research boat. The trip starts at 7am and lasts nine hours; you're advised to bring food, waterproof clothing and seasickness pills. Manning the small craft is another biologist from the Whale Center, David Morin, and another intern. There are also two other paying guests on board, Agnes and Wally, a Massachusetts couple in late middle-age, very hearty. He keeps laughing at everything, and I mean everything - but luckily the boat's engine is so noisy that everyone is forced into silence. </p> <p> It's a peculiarly beautiful day, overcast yet utterly calm: immense stretches of pearl-grey ocean, its texture like oil, like silk, like ice cream. Encountering our first humpback, the view is very different from the other day: down in this low, small vessel, we're right alongside the giant. It is bubble-feeding, which provides a riveting display. Diving below the prey - a shoal of little sand eels - the whale releases air from its lungs. You see a patch of water darken as the panicking eels crowd closer to the surface. A flock of seagulls gathers overheard. </p> <p>The water starts to dance - as though it's raining, yet from below - and a translucent glow develops as more air is released by the rising whale. The water's seething now - seething with excitement, like we are - the hovering gulls shriek with anticipation, and then, abruptly, like the shark in Jaws yet a hundred times bigger, the whale's black head bursts into view, pink mouth agape, white throat swelling. The seagulls go crazy, picking off eels still wriggling on the surface or escaping from the side of the whale's mouth. One bird lands on the gargantuan snout and balances there, wings half-open, ready for take-off at any moment.</p> <p>On our boat Agnes is in a state. \"Oh whaddaya do with whales?\" she cries; \"D'you watch 'em or d'you photograph 'em?\"</p> <p>We find a swimming mother and calf next, and steer alongside. So close you can see every rivulet of water running over the gently lunging backs, and the drizzle of misty breath returning to the surface after they blow. This is a strange, marvellous sound - rather like horses blowing their lips - and then you hear the mighty lungs filling with air again: a hollow, wet roar. Agnes lowers her camera, Wally stops talking and laughing; everyone just stands there watching the two leviathans. We journey with them for half an hour. It's very tranquil, very moving: their acceptance of us, their trust. Unfortunately, it's also what made them so easy to hunt.</p> <p>When we finally get back to Gloucester, Greg and I both have mild sunstroke, mild hypothermia, and keep lurching about on completely solid ground. Yet we can't stop grinning. What a day!</p> <p>Finally to New York. Could anything be more different? Well, actually it's not. This is holiday weekend, Fourth of July, and the city's great avenues are deserted, more majestic than ever, and - who would have ever used this word here? - peaceful. </p> <p>It's a terrific weekend. We lunch at the Tavern in the Park, we visit the Ellis Island museum in the renovated immigration buildings - storehouse of so many extraordinary tales - and we see two shows, both off Broadway. An all-black cast in August Wilson's early play Jitney, and the Tectonic Theatre Company in Moises Kaufman's The Laramie Project. The second - about the 1998 murder of a gay college student in Laramie, Wyoming - is one of the finest, most compassionate pieces of theatre I've seen in ages.

      "bodyText": "The RSC, who've paid my fare, believe I've come to America to play Macbeth at the International Festival of Arts and Ideas at New Haven, Connecticut, but I'm afraid my mind is focused on the holiday afterwards in Massachusetts - whale-watching. We've been doing Macbeth for nine months, in Stratford, London and Tokyo; this is the finish - a doddle. Ah. How wrong I will be. This play doesn't carry a health warning for nothing. A harbour city, New Haven has perversely cut itself off from the water with an ugly tangle of freeways, and presents a rather rough, industrial face. Yet it's also home to Yale University - enclaves of elegant Gothic buildings in spotless rose, cream and honey-coloured brick. The university boasts two art galleries. The Yale University Gallery owns Van Goghs, Picassos, Monets, you name 'em, and - my favourite - a basement full of ancient Mexican figures in flame-red terracotta. Across the road is the Yale Centre for British Art. As part of the Festival (other visitors include the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Swedish Ballet and the Saigon Water Puppet Theatre), it's presenting an Art of Bloomsbury exhibition. Walking round, I happen upon a private tour - well-heeled New Englanders being shown round by a George Burns lookalike in polka-dot bow tie. One bejewelled old dame is so enraptured she marches up to a gallery attendant - \"Say, are these pictures for sale?\" The man gives a spluttering laugh - \"They're from the Tate!\" She doesn't bat an eye - \"Okay, so who do I talk to at the Tate?\" We're performing at the Long Wharf Theatre. One of America's most celebrated regional playhouses, its setting is bizarre. You drive into a sprawling car park. All around are refrigerator trucks, workers in gumboots and shower caps, signs like Lamberti Sausage Inc, Carl's Boned Chicken Inc, and here, among these meat-packing plants, the Long Wharf Theatre. As you gasp at the oddness, there's another surprise. A smell of blood hangs in the air. Especially ripe in the midsummer humidity. As the vegetarians in the company turn green (including our formidable Lady M, Harriet Walter), it occurs to me that this isn't bad preparation for an audience coming to Macbeth - a form of aroma-theatre, though I wouldn't want to do Merry Wives of Windsor here. We open to a rapturous reception. It's very exciting - the whales may yet find this a hard act to follow - till the first Saturday morning when I suddenly wake with no voice. I'm rushed to a specialist who says it's a throat infection that afflicts many visitors to the US, caused by the drastic temperature change from the outside heat to arctic air-conditioning indoors. Fortified with pills and sprays, I'm determined to do that night's performance. But when I open my mouth to say the first line, a rasping nothingness comes out. People onstage later describe it as sounding like The Exorcist, or when you try to shout for help in a nightmare. Which isn't far from the truth. We're forced to stop the show. An announcement is made, my understudy, John Killoran, takes over heroically, and I flee. This would be bad enough at an ordinary performance, but it turns out the top critic in the land is in - Ben Brantley, New York Times. I've just committed professional suicide. I hole up in my hotel room for the next two days. Throughout our run, we've all steadfastly denied The Curse of the Scottish Play. Do I have to admit to it now? No. Brantley shows surprising mercy - for a critic - and returns when I'm back on. He then writes the review that dreams are made of. Next, Greg Doran, our director (and my partner) arrives from England with news that Channel 4 want to film this Macbeth. Cursed? No, no. After the last performance, Greg and I head north to Rockport, Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Rockport is a rather cutesy little summer resort, its original fishermen's cottages converted into gift shops. It's a dry town, but you can bring your own liquor. We're staying at the Yankee Clipper Inn, a lovely group of silvery-grey clapboard houses on a great lawn that slopes down to the sea. Our room has a vast, sun-filled sea view. After nine months in the heart of darkness, this is perfect. Three miles away is the fishing port of Gloucester, a grittier, saltier place, everything rusty, peeling at the edges. The Whale Center of New England is based here. We've secured places on its small research vessel (you make a special application for these), but that's two days away - meanwhile, we take a trip with one of the big tourist whale-watching outfits, Captain Bill's. In fact, they're linked to the Whale Center, and its director Mason Weinrich happens to be the guide onboard today's crowded, two-decked catamaran. Having read about him in Mark Carwardine's On the Trail of the Whale (an excellent handbook to whale-watching round the world), I'd pictured him as a weathered old character, part scientist, part fisherman. Instead, he's more like someone from a Californian rock band: a tall, handsome figure with jet black hair, beard and shades, pacing round the deck with a cordless mike. It takes two hours to reach Stellwagen Bank, the underwater plateau whose rich feeding grounds attract large numbers of humpback, fin and minke whales. Suddenly an intensely black shape breaks the vast blueness of the scene. The ship changes course and picks up speed. \"Humpbacks . . . a mother and calf,\" Mason says into his mike. \"It's... yes... Scratch and Stout.\" Mason is doing three jobs at once: training an intern at his side, calling out directions to the ship's captain, and explaining whale behaviour to us, his mesmerised audience of tourists. Scratch is teaching Stout to kick-feed. This involves whacking the tail on the surface above a shoal of fish, and then diving open-mouthed into their stunned midst. On each dive you see a powerful arching of the spine (this put the \"hump\" in \"humpback\"), and then the tail lifts, showing the white markings underneath - the identifying feature of each whale - in a manner that is infinitely graceful and rather sexy. It's like a lady lowering a fan for a long, slow moment. Look, this is who I am. Now Stout swims towards the ship, dives under it and surfaces directly below our deck. Her long, white flippers show first, two turquoise wings in the dark water, then there's the gradual revelation of her enormous body - this is only a calf! - colossal yet weightless, slowly rising into view like a kind of dream. I glance at Greg. His eyes are full. So are mine. In between whale expeditions, we visit nearby Salem, site of the notorious witch trials of 1692. We're hoping for some penetrating insights into the supernatural, perhaps providing new material for our TV Macbeth, but the town is like a theme park with the Witch Dungeon Museum, the Crypt Caf\u00e9, Fatima's Psychic Studio and so on, every establishment fronted by people in amateurish period costumes. We flee. I'm both excited and apprehensive about our day on the whale research boat. The trip starts at 7am and lasts nine hours; you're advised to bring food, waterproof clothing and seasickness pills. Manning the small craft is another biologist from the Whale Center, David Morin, and another intern. There are also two other paying guests on board, Agnes and Wally, a Massachusetts couple in late middle-age, very hearty. He keeps laughing at everything, and I mean everything - but luckily the boat's engine is so noisy that everyone is forced into silence. It's a peculiarly beautiful day, overcast yet utterly calm: immense stretches of pearl-grey ocean, its texture like oil, like silk, like ice cream. Encountering our first humpback, the view is very different from the other day: down in this low, small vessel, we're right alongside the giant. It is bubble-feeding, which provides a riveting display. Diving below the prey - a shoal of little sand eels - the whale releases air from its lungs. You see a patch of water darken as the panicking eels crowd closer to the surface. A flock of seagulls gathers overheard. The water starts to dance - as though it's raining, yet from below - and a translucent glow develops as more air is released by the rising whale. The water's seething now - seething with excitement, like we are - the hovering gulls shriek with anticipation, and then, abruptly, like the shark in Jaws yet a hundred times bigger, the whale's black head bursts into view, pink mouth agape, white throat swelling. The seagulls go crazy, picking off eels still wriggling on the surface or escaping from the side of the whale's mouth. One bird lands on the gargantuan snout and balances there, wings half-open, ready for take-off at any moment. On our boat Agnes is in a state. \"Oh whaddaya do with whales?\" she cries; \"D'you watch 'em or d'you photograph 'em?\" We find a swimming mother and calf next, and steer alongside. So close you can see every rivulet of water running over the gently lunging backs, and the drizzle of misty breath returning to the surface after they blow. This is a strange, marvellous sound - rather like horses blowing their lips - and then you hear the mighty lungs filling with air again: a hollow, wet roar. Agnes lowers her camera, Wally stops talking and laughing; everyone just stands there watching the two leviathans. We journey with them for half an hour. It's very tranquil, very moving: their acceptance of us, their trust. Unfortunately, it's also what made them so easy to hunt. When we finally get back to Gloucester, Greg and I both have mild sunstroke, mild hypothermia, and keep lurching about on completely solid ground. Yet we can't stop grinning. What a day! Finally to New York. Could anything be more different? Well, actually it's not. This is holiday weekend, Fourth of July, and the city's great avenues are deserted, more majestic than ever, and - who would have ever used this word here? - peaceful. It's a terrific weekend. We lunch at the Tavern in the Park, we visit the Ellis Island museum in the renovated immigration buildings - storehouse of so many extraordinary tales - and we see two shows, both off Broadway. An all-black cast in August Wilson's early play Jitney, and the Tectonic Theatre Company in Moises Kaufman's The Laramie Project. The second - about the 1998 murder of a gay college student in Laramie, Wyoming - is one of the finest, most compassionate pieces of theatre I've seen in ages. And the ensemble acting in both shows is inspiring: American acting at its best, completely inhibited, never patronising. On our last day, news arrives from the RSC: our New York Times review has resulted in several offers to bring the show to Broadway. As we fly out of JFK, there's a sense we might be back sooner than we thought. The curse of Macbeth came close for a moment, yet now it seems more like a blessing again... but I mustn't say that out loud.

      "body": "<p>The Taj Mahal Challenge, I soon realised, is many challenges rolled into one. There's the challenge of raising the sponsorship, of doing the training, of coping with roughing it in a third-world country. But, most of all, there is the challenge of completing the course itself: 250 miles, from Jaipur to Agra, of heat, sweat, dust and aching limbs. </p> <p>Every day on the ride was much like another and each one started at 6am. We all paired up and slept in two-person tents that were erected for us each night and, in the morning, one of the crew would wake you with a cup of tea or coffee. He would also leave a bowl of warm water for a stand-up wash. The braver ones would walk over to one of the two loos, which were nothing more than freshly-dug holes in the ground surrounded by canvas awnings. Most of us preferred to wander off and find a shrub to hide behind.</p> <p>Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, porridge, usually an omelette, and mountains of toast. The next important task was to fill our water bottles. Gallons of water were boiled for at least 20 minutes every evening and left to cool overnight, making it safe to drink. Huge drums went with us on the buses so that we could refill our water bottles whenever we wanted. By 8am, with packs loaded, water bottles filled, sunscreen smeared, limbs stretched and helmets fastened, we were off. </p> <p>The route took 28 of us across rural India. By midday, the temperature was nudging 80F. Most of the time we cycled along quiet country roads that were pot-holed and rutted, and which threaded their way through small villages. Mustard fields stretched to the horizon. We shared the roads with old men in dirty dhotis shepherding flocks of goats; carts going to and from market piled high with vegetables and heaved along by water buffaloes; and gaudily-painted public buses and delivery lorries decked out in tinsel that would announce themselves with a teeth-rattling blast of their horns and thunder by leaving inches to spare.</p> <p>By lunchtime, I always felt capable of tucking into my inner tube, so the sight of the chuckwagon parked up in a field, with delicious smells wafting from the pots on the gas braziers, and the clink of cold drinks being handed round, was a life-saver. </p> <p>The food was excellent: vegetarian dishes including dahl (lentil curry), bowls of differently-flavoured noodles, fried chicken and chicken curries, lamb dishes, rice, rotis and naan breads. </p> <p>Lunch or dinner, the story was always the same: we would stop in the middle of nowhere and, as if by magic, hundreds of villagers would appear. Men would drop their tools and leave the fields, passing goatherds would detour, women would abandon their washing and schoolrooms would empty at a rush. It was as if the circus had come to town. It took a day or two to get used to the idea of eating your meal with a couple of hundred sets of eyes staring at you from a distance of three feet. </p> <p>Cycling through the villages themselves was an experience not to be forgotten. </p> <p>The roads were never any more than narrow strips of rubble. But the typical street teemed with auto-rickshaws, camel carts, lorries and buses, all with people hanging off them. Everything happened in the street: food was cooked, tools were sharpened, chins shaved, motors fixed, goats butchered, children taught, deals done, clothes washed and bowels opened. Every village street was also a farmyard. Pigs ambled by, burying their snouts into piles of foul-smelling rubbish and cows wandered wherever they wanted, stopping occasionally to unleash a stream of bright yellow urine. It was bedlam and it was brilliant. </p> <p>What was already a seething hive of activity was spurred into even greater action by the arrival of 28 Brits on bikes. The effect was like dropping a bowling ball on a wasp's nest. Nobody stopped what they were doing but at the same time managed to shout a greeting or hold out a hand to be slapped in high-five fashion. People would clamber on to rooftops to get a better view of us, and naked children would bolt from their mothers' laps and almost run under our wheels to shout \"Allo\" or \"Ram Ram\" or \"Namaste\" in greeting. Then suddenly you would find yourself in open fields again. </p> <p>On most days we finished riding by early evening. The crew would have gone on ahead and pitched camp. Darkness fell quickly and by 7.30pm dinner was served. We ate in the open air under the light of hurricane lamps. Then, the crew would build a fire and we would sit around swapping stories. By 10pm, people would start drifting off to bed and the last ones would follow not much later. There's nothing like pedalling 50 miles a day for guaranteeing you a good night's sleep. Each night, I closed my eyes relieved that I had completed another day and content in the knowledge that we were going to do it all over again tomorrow. And there was always the Taj Mahal to look forward to.</p> <p>So what was it like? Like nothing else I had ever done. Was it physically demanding? Make no mistake, it was tough. For day two, my diary has a one-word entry: torture. What was the most amazing thing I saw? Incredible sights, too numerous to mention, jostle for position. Does the Taj Mahal live up to its reputation? Yes, and more. Is the poverty upsetting? Heartbreakingly so. Did I feel a sense of achievement? Definitely, not just for physically completing the challenge but knowing I had done something for someone else. What will I remember most? Life in the villages made the most vivid impressions on me, but the most memorable experience will be meeting up with a group of strangers who, within the space of only a few days, became like people I had known for years. Would I do it all over again? Like a shot.</p> <p><strong> Sponsored holidays</strong></p> <p><strong> How do you apply?</strong><br> I saw an ad in the paper and phoned the charity for a free pack that gave me the itinerary for the trip. We would fly to Delhi, be bussed down to Jaipur and then start the ride. Bikes would be supplied and we would be in the saddle for five days, averaging 50 miles a day, sleeping in tents, and finishing at the Taj Mahal.</p> <p><strong> What was the cause?</strong><br> Whizz-Kidz is a registered charity that helps disabled children, supplying mobility aids such as motorised wheelchairs and trikes.</p> <p><strong> What was the deal?</strong><br> You had to raise a minimum of \u00a32,500 through sponsorship. There was also a registration fee of \u00a3250 that was refundable if you raised more than \u00a33,500. If you failed to raise the target, you had to make up the difference yourself.</p> <p><strong> Where did the money go?</strong><br> Out of a minimum \u00a32,500, \u00a3897 went on sending each volunteer on the trip. This included flights, accommodation, meals and the services of the operating tour company that organised the ride and supplied the bikes. This left \u00a31,603, which if added to the registration fee, meant \u00a31,853 went directly to support the work of the charity. And many volunteers raised more than the minimum amount. </p> <p><strong> How fit do you have to be?</strong><br> Whizz-Kidz tells you that \"a reasonable level of fitness is essential\". It is, after all, a challenge, but one that is designed for people from all walks of life. However, there's no substitute for putting the hours in on your bike for at least three months before you go. </p> <p><strong> Were we well prepared for India?</strong><br> We were given all the information we needed: how to apply for a visa, what to bring and wear, what not to eat and drink, safety tips and advice on coping with the heat. </p> <p><strong> How can you be sure an overseas charity event is reputable?</strong><br> All reputable charity organisations that raise money through overseas events comply with the code of conduct laid down by the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers (ICFM). Ask that the charity complies with these guidelines, or, if you have any concerns, phone the ICFM on 020-7627 3436.</p> <p>\u0095 Whizz-Kidz is still recruiting volunteers for the this year's Taj Mahal Challenge in November.

How fit do you have to be? Whizz-Kidz tells you that \"a reasonable level of fitness is essential\". It is, after all, a challenge, but one that is designed for people from all walks of life. However, there's no substitute for putting the hours in on your bike for at least three months before you go. Were we well prepared for India? We were given all the information we needed: how to apply for a visa, what to bring and wear, what not to eat and drink, safety tips and advice on coping with the heat. How can you be sure an overseas charity event is reputable? All reputable charity organisations that raise money through overseas events comply with the code of conduct laid down by the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers (ICFM). Ask that the charity complies with these guidelines, or, if you have any concerns, phone the ICFM on 020-7627 3436. \u0095 Whizz-Kidz is still recruiting volunteers for the this year's Taj Mahal Challenge in November. For details and for information about other Whizz-Kidz overseas events, telephone Angela Wong, events fundraiser, on 020-7233 6600, e-mail a.wong@whizz-kidz.org.uk, or visit www.whizz-kidz.org.uk",

This enables you to negotiate stays with other members, reserving in advance or staying at short notice.

It's a hotel search and booking service. Leisure Hunt lists hotels from all over the world. The blurb on the front claims to recognise \"towns and villages worldwide\". This is something of an exaggeration, although it does hold true for the US and Britain: the UK has 33,000 listings. As an indication, Leisure Hunt lists five hotels in Warsaw, all of them sizeable and one of them not built from concrete. All the entries are illustrated and have star ratings.</p> <p><strong>On the other hand...</strong><br> Only a very small selection of hotels are discounted, and on the days I visited the special offers were confined to British chains. Nor were they particularly cheap - a 15% discount on a three-night stay in Oasis Village Lakeland in Penrith, for example, reduced the price to \u00a3277.</p> <p><strong>Can I book?</strong><br> That depends on the hotel. Some of them are linked to the SpeedBook network; others have to be contacted individually.</p> <p><strong>I'm not very excited.</strong><br> The art of building a successful travel site lies in building up a database and manipulating it successfully. Leisure Hunt has managed the former, but they haven't put much effort into the latter. The result is a flat, lifeless endeavour which, while it functions perfectly adequately, is unlikely to inspire visitors. For purposeful travellers only.</p>",

Logis de France The green and yellow chimney symbol of the Logis de France indicates that a hotel aims to be as friendly as a bed and breakfast but offers some of the same facilities as a hotel. Providing you know which part of France you want to stay in, this site is an excellent source. Chalet Sauvageonne A one-off investment of \u00a315,000 will buy you a stake in this 12-bedroom catered chalet near Chamonix, 45 minutes from Geneva airport. This enables you to negotiate stays with other members, reserving in advance or staying at short notice. The Sauvageonne is included in this list for two specific reasons: first, because the new owners are looking for syndicate members via the web, and second because I have just spent a wonderful few days there. Italy Hotel Reservation Hundreds of hotels, many with their own websites and glorious photos, can be booked online here. IHR also claims to be the first hotel site to offer bookings via WAP. In addition, for alluring three- and four-star Tuscan hotels described in detail, visit www.tuscanyonline.it/accommod/hotel.htm . Visit Sweden Sweden has embraced the web with great enthusiasm, and this is an admirably efficient website where you can search for hotels by region and keyword. Site of the week: www.leisurehunt.com Anything to do with the Countryside Alliance? Not at all. It's a hotel search and booking service. Leisure Hunt lists hotels from all over the world. The blurb on the front claims to recognise \"towns and villages worldwide\". This is something of an exaggeration, although it does hold true for the US and Britain: the UK has 33,000 listings. As an indication, Leisure Hunt lists five hotels in Warsaw, all of them sizeable and one of them not built from concrete. All the entries are illustrated and have star ratings. On the other hand... Only a very small selection of hotels are discounted, and on the days I visited the special offers were confined to British chains. Nor were they particularly cheap - a 15% discount on a three-night stay in Oasis Village Lakeland in Penrith, for example, reduced the price to \u00a3277. Can I book? That depends on the hotel. Some of them are linked to the SpeedBook network; others have to be contacted individually. I'm not very excited. The art of building a successful travel site lies in building up a database and manipulating it successfully. Leisure Hunt has managed the former, but they haven't put much effort into the latter. The result is a flat, lifeless endeavour which, while it functions perfectly adequately, is unlikely to inspire visitors. For purposeful travellers only.",

No question, the powers-that-be have to do much, much more to encourage Afro-Caribbean crowds back into the specially designated sections of our Test grounds. </p> <p>For it to continue in a healthy state, this great game (cricket) needs their wonderfully positive outlook on life, and in particular their 36 quids. But how many West Indian streakers have we seen this summer? About the same number as Nass Hussain has scored runs, actually.</p> <p>It's been suggested that because of a more laid-back lifestyle they tend not to plan their streaking in advance like the English lads do, going on a strict lager and pie-and-chips diet for weeks beforehand so as to be fit for the cameras. Perhaps we could set aside a limited number of Windies streakers' tickets to be sold on the day.</p> <p>On the vexed subject of summary punishment for streakers, I don't know if anyone heard the fascinating discussion among the Test Match Special experts during the Old Trafford Test? Pod did, and there's nothing I would have liked more than to join in the free-ranging debate.

No question, the powers-that-be have to do much, much more to encourage Afro-Caribbean crowds back into the specially designated sections of our Test grounds. For it to continue in a healthy state, this great game (cricket) needs their wonderfully positive outlook on life, and in particular their 36 quids. But how many West Indian streakers have we seen this summer? About the same number as Nass Hussain has scored runs, actually. It's been suggested that because of a more laid-back lifestyle they tend not to plan their streaking in advance like the English lads do, going on a strict lager and pie-and-chips diet for weeks beforehand so as to be fit for the cameras. Perhaps we could set aside a limited number of Windies streakers' tickets to be sold on the day. On the vexed subject of summary punishment for streakers, I don't know if anyone heard the fascinating discussion among the Test Match Special experts during the Old Trafford Test? Pod did, and there's nothing I would have liked more than to join in the free-ranging debate. Sadly I was stuck in the Dartford tunnel and my Nokia decided that was the moment not to send any e-mails.

I can't imagine a better example of Things To Be Wary Of in the food department than bargain sushi. </p> <p> I never order fish on Monday, unless I'm eating at a four-star restaurant where I know they are buying their fish directly from the source. I know how old most seafood is on Monday - about four to five days old! </p> <p> I don't eat mussels in restaurants unless I know the chef, or have seen, with my own eyes, how they store and hold their mussels for service. I love mussels. But, in my experience, most cooks are less than scrupulous in their handling of them. It takes only a single bad mussel, one treacherous little guy hidden among an otherwise impeccable group ... If I'm hungry for mussels, I'll pick the good-looking ones out of your order. </p> <p>Brunch menus are an open invitation to the cost-conscious chef, a dumping ground for the odd bits left over from Friday and Saturday nights. How about hollandaise sauce? Not for me. Bacteria love hollandaise. And nobody I know has ever made hollandaise to order. And how long has that Canadian bacon been festering in the walk-in? Remember, brunch is only served once a week - on the weekends. Cooks hate brunch. Brunch is punishment block for the B-Team cooks, or where the farm team of recent dishwashers learn their chops. </p> <p> I won't eat in a restaurant with filthy bathrooms. This isn't a hard call. They let you see the bathrooms. If the restaurant can't be bothered to replace the puck in the urinal or keep the toilets and floors clean, then just imagine what their refrigeration and work spaces look like. </p> <p> Beef Parmentier? Shepherd's pie? Chilli special? Sounds like leftovers to me. How about swordfish? I like it fine. But my seafood purveyor, when he goes out to dinner, won't eat it. He's seen too many of those 3ft-long parasitic worms that riddle the fish's flesh. You see a few of these babies - and we all do - and you won't be tucking into swordfish anytime soon. </p> <p>'Saving for well-done' is a time-honoured tradition dating back to cuisine's earliest days. What happens when the chef finds a tough, slightly skanky end-cut of sirloin that's been pushed repeatedly to the back of the pile? He can throw it out, but that's a total loss. He can feed it to the family, which is the same as throwing it out. Or he can 'save for well-done': serve it to some rube who prefers his meat or fish incinerated into a flavourless, leathery hunk of carbon. </p> <p> Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter-faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn. To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living. Vegetarians are an affront to all I stand for, the pure enjoyment of food. Oh, I'll accommodate them, I'll rummage around for something to feed them. Fourteen dollars for a few slices of grilled eggplant (aubergine) and zucchini (courgette) suits my food cost fine. </p> <p><strong>Secrets of the chef's kitchen for a home cook</strong></p> <p>You need, for God's sake, a decent chef's knife. ONE good chef's knife, as large as is comfortable for your hand.

Now drag a toothpick through the rings or lines.</p> <p>Gaufrette wha'? That's French for waffle-cut. You can do that. All you need is a mandolin, a vertically held slicer with various blade settings. Dauphinois potatoes cut to identical thickness? No sweat.

Margarine? That's not food. I Can't Believe It's Not Butter? I can.</p> <p><strong> Roasted garlic</strong><br> Garlic is divine. Misuse of garlic is a crime. Old garlic, burnt garlic, garlic cut too long ago, garlic that has been smashed through one of those abominations, the garlic press, are all disgusting. Sliver it for pasta, like you saw in Goodfellas. Smash it with the flat of your knife blade. And try roasting garlic. It gets mellow and sweeter if you roast it whole, to be squeezed out later when it's soft and brown.</p> <p><strong> Chiffonaded parsley</strong><br> Restaurants garnish their food. Why shouldn't you? Dip the sprigs in cold water, shake off excess, allow to dry for a few minutes, and slice the stuff, as thinly as you can, with that sexy new chef's knife.</p> <p><strong> Stock</strong><br> The backbone of good cooking.

      "body": "<b>Dear John,</b> <br> The British Parliament and Courts until recently, have always been able to restrict the rights of the individual in the interests of the wider society. So our laws have allowed public demonstrations to be stopped if the police thought they might lead to violence; those charged with murder, manslaughter or rape could not be given bail if they had been convicted of those offences previously; prison authorities were allowed to read prisoners mail if it was thought that the letters might disclose the whereabouts of the proceeds of crime; young boys were protected from the attentions of older men by a higher age of consent for homosexual acts; and a home secretary, answerable to the House of Commons, could decide how long the worst juvenile offenders should be kept away from society. We do not have to look into the crystal ball to see whether the Human Rights Act incorporating the European Convention of Human Rights will mean that the rights of the individual will be upheld at the expense of society - we can read the book! For all the above laws - and many others - have been overruled by the European Court or by a compliant Parliament. After 2nd October the rights of the individual will take precedence over society more often Yours sincerely <br> Sir Ivan Lawrence QC <br> <br> <p><b>Dear Ivan</b><br><br> The problems with your examples are: 1) that public demonstrations would also be stopped when there was no threat, disorder or violence; 2) innocent people would be remanded in custody; 3) prison authorities could prevent communications merely because they were critical of them; 4) the protection of young people was used to justify homophobia, 5) and Home Secretaries kept people in prison not because they were dangerous but because they were concerned about the reaction of the tabloid press. <br><br> The essence of the philosophy of human rights is that there are standards which should never be breached even by a democratically elected government. For instance the Human Rights Act will mean that governments and parliaments should never be able to authorise torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment no matter what the circumstances, and no matter how popular with the electorate such conduct was. Elected parliaments in this country and around the world have shown that, on their own, they are not able to protect human rights properly. This is partly because most of them, including our own, are dominated by the government. <br><br> In any mature democracy minorities and human rights are best protected by the checks and balances in the constitution. Until the Human Rights Act came into force there were too few safeguards and the executive in Parliament was too strong and the courts have been too weak to protect rights. Democracy is important, but elections are never going to be about the detailed rights of this or that group and unfortunately the rights of minorities or those suspected of crime are never going to be popular enough to make a difference. <br><br> Yours sincerely<br> John Wadham Director, Liberty. <br><br> <b>Dear John,</b> <br><br> Since you do not deny that the individual will take precedence over society more often, I take it that you are conceding the point. <br><br> Whilst I deny the problems you allege with my examples will arise, I do agree that democracy alone does not necessarily provide protection for the individual. Indeed the strength of our own system is that democracy, together with an independent judiciary and the rule of law, does provide that safeguard. <br><br> When Britain helped to draft, and then were amongst the first to ratify the European Convention in 1951, it was to prevent a repeat of the Holocaust in the new Europe, not to allow European judges to over-rule our British Parliament or judges in much less significant matters which ought to remain within the province of a democratic nation state. Under this legislation it will be European, not British, judges who in the end may decide that we cannot return Sikh terrorists to their own country or that a car owner should not have to say who was driving when it set off a speed camera. <br><br> What most interested people, I suspect, might ask is - why should not our own judges be the ones who decide, if they consider it appropriate to do so, that in these matters the interests of the individual foreign visitor, or car owner, can be overridden in the interests of society generally? <br><br> Yours, <br> Ivan Lawrence<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Ivan</b><br><br></p> <p>There are difficult issues to resolve between the individual's rights and that of society but the key question is who decides what society needs. The Human Rights Act will mean that, when police officers, bureaucrats or even Parliament is making those decisions on our behalf, they have to be more careful. The power exercised by the state and its agents will have to be a proportionate response - no sledgehammers to crack nuts. <br><br> I must say I find it surprising for you to criticise the Convention on the basis of the nationality of the judges. Many of them are renowned experts on human rights and one of the virtues of the system is that it allows others with a fresh approach to consider our law and practices. <br><br> After all, if our system of justice is so good we should be able to persuade the rest of the world of this. Also, other countries with very similar legal traditions like Canada and New Zealand have very similar Bills of Rights and their judges are making similar decisions to those in Europe. International human rights now has very consistent thinking on many areas and it is about time our judges were exposed to this and could contribute to it. <br><br> Every time I ask people in this country to sit down and draft the kinds of rights that they want for themselves, their families and their friends, they produce a list very like the rights in the Convention - the right to life, privacy, a fair trial etc. Every other mature democracy has such a system to protect it against the government, the police and other public agencies and I am surprised that, as a good Tory living under a Labour Government which has a large majority you don't want this too. <br><br> Yours<br>John Wadham<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear John,</b> <br><br> I believe that all our national institutions - police, bureaucracy, Government, Parliament and the Courts - should be continually reminded of the need to uphold civil liverties and human rights: that is why I supported the incorporation of the Convention into our law even when my Party opposed it. Furthermore, I see no reason why we should not also have regard to the judgements of Commonwealth countries based on our legal traditions outside Europe - of Canada and New Zealand which you do mention and of South Africa which you do not. <br><br> But the issue is not whether international judicial experience should be permitted to influence or guide our own deliberations, but whether our own judges and democratic institutions are so defective and incompetent that we cannot any longer be trusted to make our own decisions and be the master of own destiny - and whether our judges should be allowed to decide when the interests of the individual should take precedence over the interests of society as a whole. <br><br> I do not recall the British people being asked whether they wished our laws and legal judgements to be overridden by judges from different national traditions however renowned and distinguished. I suspect that I know what their answer would have been - and therefore why they were never asked! <br><br> Yours<br>Ivan Lawrence<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Ivan</b><br><br> I am glad to see you have \"come out\" as a supporter of the Human Rights Act (although I know this has always been your public position). You are right to raise the question of the need for more involvement of the people on matters relating to human rights. That is why we and others were disappointed that the government did not create a Human Rights Commission which could have helped to have informed the public (as well as providing much needed authoritive guidance to those in public bodies). <br><br> There is, however, to be a Human Rights Committee in Parliament which will help the Commons and the Lords to play their part in protecting human rights. It is unfortunate, however, that it has taken Parliament two years to set this Committee up, particularly because it will not even be in place when the Act comes into force in October. <br><br> One last matter about judges. This country now has the best set of judges we have ever had and they can be trusted to protect our rights. Nevertheless urgent action needs to be taken to appoint more women judges and judges from ethnic minority groups - we desperately need their expertise too. We also need to remove the power to appoint our judges from the government (in effect, the Lord Chancellor) and put it in the hands of an independent appointments committee. <br><br> Yours<br> John Wadham<br><br></p> <p> <b> Links:</b><br><br> <a href=\"http://www.penlex.org.uk/pages/eurcon.html\">Full details of the convention</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/\">Liberty</a></p>",

Indeed the strength of our own system is that democracy, together with an independent judiciary and the rule of law, does provide that safeguard. When Britain helped to draft, and then were amongst the first to ratify the European Convention in 1951, it was to prevent a repeat of the Holocaust in the new Europe, not to allow European judges to over-rule our British Parliament or judges in much less significant matters which ought to remain within the province of a democratic nation state. Under this legislation it will be European, not British, judges who in the end may decide that we cannot return Sikh terrorists to their own country or that a car owner should not have to say who was driving when it set off a speed camera. What most interested people, I suspect, might ask is - why should not our own judges be the ones who decide, if they consider it appropriate to do so, that in these matters the interests of the individual foreign visitor, or car owner, can be overridden in the interests of society generally? Yours, Ivan Lawrence Dear Ivan There are difficult issues to resolve between the individual's rights and that of society but the key question is who decides what society needs. The Human Rights Act will mean that, when police officers, bureaucrats or even Parliament is making those decisions on our behalf, they have to be more careful. The power exercised by the state and its agents will have to be a proportionate response - no sledgehammers to crack nuts. I must say I find it surprising for you to criticise the Convention on the basis of the nationality of the judges. Many of them are renowned experts on human rights and one of the virtues of the system is that it allows others with a fresh approach to consider our law and practices. After all, if our system of justice is so good we should be able to persuade the rest of the world of this. Also, other countries with very similar legal traditions like Canada and New Zealand have very similar Bills of Rights and their judges are making similar decisions to those in Europe. International human rights now has very consistent thinking on many areas and it is about time our judges were exposed to this and could contribute to it. Every time I ask people in this country to sit down and draft the kinds of rights that they want for themselves, their families and their friends, they produce a list very like the rights in the Convention - the right to life, privacy, a fair trial etc. Every other mature democracy has such a system to protect it against the government, the police and other public agencies and I am surprised that, as a good Tory living under a Labour Government which has a large majority you don't want this too. Yours John Wadham Dear John, I believe that all our national institutions - police, bureaucracy, Government, Parliament and the Courts - should be continually reminded of the need to uphold civil liverties and human rights: that is why I supported the incorporation of the Convention into our law even when my Party opposed it. Furthermore, I see no reason why we should not also have regard to the judgements of Commonwealth countries based on our legal traditions outside Europe - of Canada and New Zealand which you do mention and of South Africa which you do not. But the issue is not whether international judicial experience should be permitted to influence or guide our own deliberations, but whether our own judges and democratic institutions are so defective and incompetent that we cannot any longer be trusted to make our own decisions and be the master of own destiny - and whether our judges should be allowed to decide when the interests of the individual should take precedence over the interests of society as a whole. I do not recall the British people being asked whether they wished our laws and legal judgements to be overridden by judges from different national traditions however renowned and distinguished. I suspect that I know what their answer would have been - and therefore why they were never asked! Yours Ivan Lawrence Dear Ivan I am glad to see you have \"come out\" as a supporter of the Human Rights Act (although I know this has always been your public position). You are right to raise the question of the need for more involvement of the people on matters relating to human rights. That is why we and others were disappointed that the government did not create a Human Rights Commission which could have helped to have informed the public (as well as providing much needed authoritive guidance to those in public bodies). There is, however, to be a Human Rights Committee in Parliament which will help the Commons and the Lords to play their part in protecting human rights. It is unfortunate, however, that it has taken Parliament two years to set this Committee up, particularly because it will not even be in place when the Act comes into force in October. One last matter about judges. This country now has the best set of judges we have ever had and they can be trusted to protect our rights. Nevertheless urgent action needs to be taken to appoint more women judges and judges from ethnic minority groups - we desperately need their expertise too. We also need to remove the power to appoint our judges from the government (in effect, the Lord Chancellor) and put it in the hands of an independent appointments committee.

I got out of a taxi by the green in Westlington in deepest rural Buckinghamshire. I saw him watching me out of one of the restaurant windows as I paid the driver and made my way to the front door. I was his only customer that lunchtime and, as he had seen me arrive, I couldn't very well pretend that I had just happened to drop by. So, after a brief skirmish, I owned up that I had come to review his restaurant. Well, I had to do something - he thought that I was a Michelin inspector. </p> <p>Nothing much seemed to have changed with La Chouette or Monsieur Desmette, I am pleased to say, when the wife of my bosom and I stopped off for lunch there the other day. Westlington still put me in mind of Sir Henry Newbolt's words about there being \"a deathly hush in the close\". Ours was the only car in the car park. The beetle-browed chef watched us out of a window of the very pretty brick-and-flint building as we marched across to the door, and welcomed us, the only customers for that lunch. I must have changed a bit since the last time we met, because he didn't exactly fall on me, instead treated us with his brisk line of charm and hospitality. </p> <p>M. Desmette is a true original. You'd have to be to have survived 10 years in Westlington. That was the reason we were there. I had passed on the official celebrations marking this achievement a week or so back, which involved dozens of regular customers, friends and two jazz bands. M. Desmette is something of an aficionado of jazz. In fact, it wouldn't be going too far to say that he was obsessed by it, just as he is by photographing birds, cooking, serving and drinking Belgian beers, and being tremendously forthright about his views on his neighbours, other chefs, food on TV, the iniquities of banks and much else beside, which he announces with considerable vigour in between bringing courses of food and wine or beer. The fact that he does both on all but his busiest nights is one of the reasons he has kept going when many around him have struck camp and crept away. </p> <p>The style of his cooking hasn't changed much, either, I was pleased to note from the menu. M. Desmette is Belgian, and he has no truck with dietary niceties and the modern taste for culinary mix'n'match, airy-fairy sauces and olive oil washing over everything. It has not been touched by kaffir lime leaves, balsamic vinegar, lemongrass, stir fry or any nonsense of that kind. His style is unabashedly old-fashioned and chunky-cut. It stands full square on both the plate and the palate, and is reminiscent of the kind of food you used to get in traditional restaurants de famille in France. </p> <p>My filet de barbue \u00e0 la Duvel was a typical Desmette dish. Duvel is a Belgian beer, and its particular light scent ran like a melody through the buttery richness of the sauce, which made a particularly opulent and classic accompaniment to a magnificent hunk of brill, all taut and muscular as fresh brill should be. </p> <p>The wife of my bosom's salade de blanc de volaille was a rather less classic affair, encompassing bits of warm chicken, endive fris\u00e9e, bits of plum and a quite-tart dressing made with very good red-wine vinegar. Strange as it may seem, it was delightfully refreshing, full of crunch in various keys. </p> <p>The salad was a useful contrast to her filet de saumon d'\u00c9cosse \u00e0 la blanche, which, although made with a different beer, was a close cousin to my first dish, with a sauce like liquid velvet wrapping a carefully-cooked brick of salmon. My cte de veau \u00e0 jus was just as majestic: a great slab of a chop covering two thirds of the plate, the rest of which was covered with an Andy Flintoff of a gravy and little bundles of vegetables arranged like points around a compass. </p> <p>These last represent my only reservation about the food at La Chouette: the vegetables hark back to plate accessories of 10, even 20 years ago.

Anyway, there are plenty at the \u00a320 mark and below to keep distressed gentlefolk such as myself very happy. I was in a similar mood when signing the credit-card slip for \u00a385.38. It seemed a small contribution to the next decade of one of Britain's more individual outposts of gastronomy",

They start flowering in late May, being lilac mauve then, but keep their shape, while gradually bleaching, through the summer. It sows itself liberally, if you give it the chance, and I value it for pepping up my Japanese anemones when they are only half grown.

      "bodyText": "There were fresh protests in Plymouth, Devon, last night outside the house of a convicted child molester as the parents of Sarah Payne pledged to stage a personal protest march on parliament if the government does not introduce laws to clamp down on sex offenders. It also emerged that mother of five Katrina Kessell, 33, who led hundreds of protesters around the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth, has been reported to social services after her three-year-old son was found wandering naked half a mile from her home. Ms Kessell was being interviewed by a television station on Thursday morning when her son Nassar was found near a busy road by a passer-by. A report on the incident was forwarded to social workers by police as standard procedure. Last night the parents of murdered eight-year-old Sarah Payne called on protesters to end their demonstrations. But they said that if the government did not act within six months to introduce a so-called Sarah's Law, they would join the protesters and take their campaign directly to parliament. Sara Payne told Channel 4 News: \"What we say is, 'Don't be violent. Give us a chance to change the law.' People are listening now. The government is listening now. If in six months we haven't got anywhere, we will protest with you, but it will be peaceful. \"We will walk to London if we have to. We will walk to the House of Commons and sit there until they listen.\" She added: \"To say goodbye to Sarah... I don't know how we are going to do it. But if a change in the law is Sarah's legacy to the world, then it's a good legacy.\" On the Southway estate in Plymouth, where there were protests earlier this week, residents returned to demonstrate outside the home of 73-year-old Jan Goodliffe, a convicted sex offender, just hours after meeting a senior police officer. He was subjected to chants earlier this week by a placard-waving crowd and had a lump of concrete thrown through his window. Last night police were guarding his house against further attacks. Karen Jones, a Southway residents' spokeswoman, said the residents had heard nothing to persuade them to call off their demonstrations. \"We are continuing to protest,\" she said, adding that local people would be holding talks later to plan more action. Other protests on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth were suspended after a number of families were driven from their homes. Mr Goodliffe said he could not afford to move and was not a threat to children, adding that he was not fearful for his own safety. He returned to the terraced house he owns on the estate last month after serving a four year sentence for indecently assaulting a 12-year-old boy.",

Aslef members who drive Eurotunnel's shuttle trains voted by 110 votes to seven to ban overtime, it was announced yesterday, in protest against the company's refusal to negotiate pay and conditions with the union. Instead, Eurotunnel - which has hitherto been the only train operator not to recognise unions - signed a single union deal in June with the Transport and General Workers' Union to represent all staff, under pressure from the new union recognition legislation. The dispute has come to a head at the peak period for cross-Channel traffic - last year nearly 1m cars and more than 200,000 lorries were carried on the shuttle during the summer. Eurotunnel's managing director Bill Dix said yesterday he was confident the industrial action would have little or no impact, because overtime on the shuttle service was \"extremely limited\" - less than 1% between January and June this year. But an Aslef spokesman said the union would hold a full-scale strike ballot if the company failed to respond and added that the union was also determined to improve Eurotunnel drivers' pay, which at an average of \u00a318,000 a year was the lowest in the country. \"Eurotunnel should talk to Aslef before their industrial intransigence inconveniences the public,\" said the union's general secretary Mick Rix.",

      "body": "<p>This is the history of a failure. It descends into anecdotic detail, as one would expect in episodes from a war, but this is blended with reflections and critical analysis. For in my view, any importance the story might have lies in the fact that it allows the experiences to be extracted for the use of other revolutionary movements. </p> <p>Victory is a great source of positive experiences, but so is defeat, especially if the unusual circumstances surrounding the incident are taken into account: the actors and informants are foreigners who went to risk their lives in an unknown land where people spoke a different language and were linked to them only by ties of proletarian internationalism, so that a method not practised in modern wars of liberation was thereby inaugurated. </p> <p>These notes will be published some time after they were dictated, and it may be that the author will no longer be able to take responsibility for what is said in them. </p> <p>More correctly, this is the history of a decomposition. When we arrived on Congolese soil, the revolution was in a period of reflux; then a number of incidents occurred which brought about its final regression, at this time and place at least, in the immense field of struggle that is the Congo. </p> <p>The most interesting aspect here is not the story of the decomposition of the Congolese revolution, whose causes and key features are too profound to be all encompassed from my particular vantage point, but rather the decomposition of our own fighting morale, since the experience we inaugurated should not go to waste and the initiative of the International Proletarian Army should not die at the first failure. It is essential to analyse in depth the problems that are posed, and to find a solution to them. A good battlefield instructor does more for the revolution than one who teaches a large number of raw recruits in a context of peace... </p> <p>The idea that guided us was to ensure that men experienced in liberation battles (and subsequently in the struggle with reactionary forces) fought alongside men without experience, and thereby bring about what we called the \"Cubanisation\" of the Congolese. It will be seen that the effect was the exact opposite, in that a \"Congolisation\" of the Cubans took place over a period of time. In speaking of Congolisation, we had in mind the series of habits and attitudes to the revolution that characterised the Congolese soldier at those moments of the struggle. This does not imply any derogatory view about the Congolese people, but it does about the soldiers at that time. In the course of the story, an attempt will be made to explain why those fighters had such negative traits. </p> <p><strong> Letter to Castro</strong><br> </p> <p> A personal letter written by Che Guevara to Fidel Castro in October 1965 shows the strength of trust between the two men, despite Guevara having left Cuba. Only to Castro could Guevara so openly express his serious doubts about the Congo project, given the competition between rival leaders in different areas. </p> <p>Congo, 5/10/65 </p> <p>Dear Fidel </p> <p>I received your letter, which has aroused contradictory feelings in me - for in the name of proletarian internationalism, we are committing mistakes that may prove very costly. I am also personally worried that, either because I have failed to write with sufficient seriousness or because you do not fully understand me, I may be thought to be suffering from the terrible disease of groundless pessimism. </p> <p>When your Greek gift [Emilio Aragones, a member of the Cuban central committee] arrived here, he told me that one of my letters had given the impression of a condemned gladiator, and the [Cuban health] minister [Jose Ramon Machado Ventura], in passing on your optimistic message, confirmed the opinion that you were forming. </p> <p>You will be able to speak at length with the bearer of this letter who will tell you his firsthand impressions after visiting much of the front; for this reason I will dispense with anecdotes. I will just say to you that, according to people close to me here, I have lost my reputation for objectivity by maintaining a groundless optimism in the face of the actual situation. I can assure you that were it not for me, this fine dream would have collapsed with catastrophe all around. </p> <p>In my previous letters, I asked to be sent not many people but cadres; there is no real lack of arms here (except for special weapons) - indeed there are too many armed men; what is lacking are soldiers. I especially warned that no more money should be given out unless it was with a dropper and after many requests. None of what I said has been heeded, and fantastic plans have been made which threaten to discredit us internationally and may land me in a very difficult position. </p> <p>I shall now explain to you. </p> <p>Soumialot [Gaston Soumialot, president of the Supreme Council of the Revolution] and his comrades have been leading you all right up the garden path. It would be tedious to list the huge number of lies they have spun. </p> <p>There are two zones where something of an organised revolution exists - the one where we ourselves are, and part of Kasai province (the great unknown quantity) where Mulele [Pierre Mulele, former minister under Lumumba and the first leader to take up arms] is based. </p> <p>In the rest of the country there are bands living in the forest, not connected to one another; they lost everything without a fight, as they lost Stanleyville without a fight. More serious than this, however, is the way in which the groups in this area (the only one with contacts to the outside) relate to one another. </p> <p>The dissensions between Kabila [then second vice-president of the Supreme Council of the Revolution and head of the eastern front where Guevara was] and Soumialot are becoming more serious all the time, and are used as a pretext to keep handing towns over without a fight. I know Kabila well enough not to have any illusions about him. I cannot say the same about Soumialot, but I have some indications such as the string of lies he has been feeding you, the fact that he does not deign to come to these godforsaken parts, his frequent bouts of drunkenness in Dar es Salaam, where he lives in the best hotels, and the kind of people he has as allies here against the other group. </p> <p>Recently a group from the Tshombist [pro-government] army landed, in the Baraka area (where a major-general loyal to Soumialot has no fewer than a thousand armed men) and captured this strategically important place almost without a fight. Now they are arguing about who was to blame - those who did not put up a fight, or those at the lake who did not send enough ammunition. The fact is that they shamelessly ran away, ditching in the open a 75mm recoilless gun and two 82 mortars; all the men assigned to these weapons have disappeared, and now they are asking me for Cubans to get them back from wherever they are (no one quite knows where) and to use them in battle. </p> <p>Nor are they doing anything to defend Fizi, 36km from here; they don't want to dig trenches on the only access road through the mountains. This will give you a faint idea of the situation. As for the need to choose men well rather than send me large numbers, you and the commissar assure me that the men here are good; I'm sure most of them are - otherwise they'd have quit long ago. But that's not the point. You have to be really well tempered to put up with the things that happen here. It's not good men but supermen that are needed... </p> <p>And there are still my 200; believe me, they would do more harm than good at the present time - unless we decide once and for all to fight alone, in which case we'll need a division and we'll have to see how many the enemy put up against us. Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration; maybe a battalion would be enough to get back to the frontiers we had when we arrived here and to threaten Albertville. </p> <p>But numbers are not what matters; we can't liberate by ourselves a country that does not want to fight; you've got to create a fighting spirit and look for soldiers with the torch of Diogenes and the patience of Job - a task that becomes more difficult, the more shits there are doing things along the way. </p> <p>The business with the money is what hurts me most, after all the warnings I gave. At the height of my \"spending spree\" and only after they had kicked up a lot of fuss, I undertook to supply one front (the most important one) on condition that I would direct the struggle and form a special mixed column under my direct command, in accordance with the strategy that I outlined and communicated to you. </p> <p>With a very heavy heart, I calculated that it would require $5,000 a month. Now I learn that a sum 20 times higher is given to people who pass through just once, so that they can live well in all the capitals of the African world, with no allowance for the fact that they receive free board and lodging and often their travel costs from the main progressive countries. Not a cent will reach a wretched front where the peasants suffer every misery you can imagine, including the rapaciousness of their own protectors; nor will anything get through to the poor devils stuck In Sudan. (Whisky and women are not on the list of expenses covered by friendly governments, and they cost a lot if you want quality.) </p> <p>Finally, 50 doctors will give the liberated area of the Congo an enviable proportion of one per thousand inhabitants - a level surpassed only by the USSR, the United States and two or three of the most advanced countries in the world. But no allowance is made for the fact that here they are distributed according to political preference, without a trace of public health organisation. Instead of such gigantism, it would be better to send a contingent of revolutionary doctors and to increase it as I request, along with highly practical nurses of a similar kind. </p> <p>As the attached map sums up the military situation, I shall limit myself to a few recommendations that I would ask you all to consider objectively: forget all the men in charge of phantom groups; train up to a hundred cadres (not necessarily all blacks)... As for weapons: the new bazooka, percussion caps with their own power supply, a few R-4s and nothing else for the moment; forget about rifles, which won't solve anything unless they are electronic. Our mortars must be in Tanzania, and with those plus a new complement of men to operate them we would have more than enough for now. Forget about Burundi and tactfully discuss the question of the launches. (Don't forget that Tanzania is an independent country and we've got to play it fair there, leaving aside the little problem I caused.) </p> <p>Send the mechanics as soon as possible, as well as someone who can steer across the lake reasonably safely; that has been discussed and Tanzania has agreed. Leave me to handle the problem of the doctors, which I will do by giving some of them to Tanzania. Don't make the mistake again of dishing out money like that; for they cling to me when they feel hard up and certainly won't pay me any attention if the money is flowing freely. Trust my judgment a little and don't go by appearances. Shake the representatives into giving truthful information, because they are not capable of figuring things out and present utopian pictures which have nothing to do with reality. </p> <p>I have tried to be explicit and objective, synthetic and truthful. Do you believe me? </p> <p>Warm greetings ... </p> <p><strong> Evacuation</strong><br> </p> <p> By November 1965 Guevara's dream had collapsed against the reality of the Congolese forces' complete incompetence and lack of realism. Grimly he had asked Havana for help to pull out his men, though he toyed with the idea of staying on as a lone exemplar of revolutionary duty. </p> <p>There was an almost complete disintegration of the troops; some party members even proposed to hold a meeting to ask me to pull out. I was extremely sharp in my replies, warning that I would not accept any such demand or any meeting of that kind and would treat it as treachery, and that I would brand as cowardice even any act of allowing such proposals to circulate. I still had a remnant of authority which kept some degree of cohesion among the Cubans; that was all. But much worse things were happening on the Congolese side. </p> <p>This paragraph will give some idea of the limbo in which the revolution was then sailing. I will take the liberty of reproducing for you the aspirations, wishes and proposals of the whole population in the Fizi region. </p> <p>1. The people demand that the military power of our revolution should be entrusted to the friendly forces who are coming to help us, until the country is stabilised. </p> <p>2. The people request intensive aid from friendly countries, consisting of: </p> <p>a) military operations, personnel, weapons, equipment, money, etc; </p> <p>b) technical assistance, engineers, various kinds of technicians, doctors, etc; </p> <p>c) social assistance, teachers, traders, industrialists. </p> <p>At 2.30pm we made contact with [the Tanzanian port of] Kigoma. Our message read: Changa: [the Cuban captain responsible for transporting supplies and messages] Total men to evacuate less than 200, will be more difficult each day that passes. We are at Sele, 10 or 15km south of Kibamba. </p> <p>And I received the longed-for reply. </p> <p>Tatu: The crossing is set for tonight. Yesterday the commissioner did not let us cross. </p> <p>The men were euphoric. I spoke with Masengo [the chief of staff of the eastern front] and suggested leaving from that very point at night. As there were a lot of Congolese, the general staff held a meeting at which it was decided that one commander would remain in the Congo with his men and we and the various leaders would evacuate; the troops who were originally from that area would remain there; they would not be told of our intention to withdraw but would be sent on various pretexts to the nearby village. </p> <p>One of the little boats we still had to ply between various points on the lake arrived and took a large number of the Congolese, but those who were part of our force smelt a rat and wanted to stay. I ordered a selection to be made of those who had conducted themselves best up to that point, so that they would be taken across as Cubans. </p> <p>For me it was a critical situation. Two men who had comprehensively fulfilled their mission would now be left behind unless they made their way back within a few hours. The full weight of calumnies - both inside and outside the Congo -would fall upon us as soon as we left. My troops were a mixed bunch, and my investigations suggested that I could extract up to 20 to follow me, this time with knitted brows. And then what would I do? All the leaders were pulling out, the peasants were displaying ever greater hostility towards us. But I was deeply pained at the thought of simply departing as we had come, leaving behind defenceless peasants and armed men whose poor battle sense left them effectively defenceless, defeated and with a feeling of betrayal. </p> <p>For me, to stay in the Congo was not a sacrifice - not for a year, or even for the five years with which I had scared my men. It was part of a concept of struggle that had fully taken shape in my brain. I could reasonably expect six or eight men to accompany me without furrowed brows. But the rest would do it as a duty, either towards me personally, or as a moral duty to the revolution; I would be sacrificing people who could not muster any enthusiasm to fight. </p> <p>In reality, the thought of remaining in the Congo continued to haunt me long into the night, and perhaps I did not so much take the decision as become one fugitive more. The way in which the Congolese comrades would view the evacuation seemed to me degrading; our withdrawal was a mere flight, or worse, we were accomplices in the deception with which people had been left on the land. </p> <p>Moreover, who was I now? I had the feeling that, after my farewell letter to Fidel, the comrades began to see me as a man from other climes rather distant from Cuba's specific problems, and I could not bring myself to demand the final sacrifice of remaining behind. I spent the final hours like this, alone and perplexed, until the boats eventually put in at two o'clock in the morning, with a Cuban crew who arrived and set off immediately that very night. </p> <p>There were too many people for the boats at that late hour. I set three o'clock as the last possible hour for departure, since it would be daylight at 5.30 and we would be in the middle of the lake. Work got under way on organising the evacuation. The sick went aboard, then the whole of Masengo's general staff - some 40 men chosen by himself - and finally all the Cubans.

      "bodyText": "This is the history of a failure. It descends into anecdotic detail, as one would expect in episodes from a war, but this is blended with reflections and critical analysis. For in my view, any importance the story might have lies in the fact that it allows the experiences to be extracted for the use of other revolutionary movements. Victory is a great source of positive experiences, but so is defeat, especially if the unusual circumstances surrounding the incident are taken into account: the actors and informants are foreigners who went to risk their lives in an unknown land where people spoke a different language and were linked to them only by ties of proletarian internationalism, so that a method not practised in modern wars of liberation was thereby inaugurated. These notes will be published some time after they were dictated, and it may be that the author will no longer be able to take responsibility for what is said in them. More correctly, this is the history of a decomposition. When we arrived on Congolese soil, the revolution was in a period of reflux; then a number of incidents occurred which brought about its final regression, at this time and place at least, in the immense field of struggle that is the Congo. The most interesting aspect here is not the story of the decomposition of the Congolese revolution, whose causes and key features are too profound to be all encompassed from my particular vantage point, but rather the decomposition of our own fighting morale, since the experience we inaugurated should not go to waste and the initiative of the International Proletarian Army should not die at the first failure. It is essential to analyse in depth the problems that are posed, and to find a solution to them. A good battlefield instructor does more for the revolution than one who teaches a large number of raw recruits in a context of peace... The idea that guided us was to ensure that men experienced in liberation battles (and subsequently in the struggle with reactionary forces) fought alongside men without experience, and thereby bring about what we called the \"Cubanisation\" of the Congolese. It will be seen that the effect was the exact opposite, in that a \"Congolisation\" of the Cubans took place over a period of time. In speaking of Congolisation, we had in mind the series of habits and attitudes to the revolution that characterised the Congolese soldier at those moments of the struggle. This does not imply any derogatory view about the Congolese people, but it does about the soldiers at that time. In the course of the story, an attempt will be made to explain why those fighters had such negative traits. Letter to Castro A personal letter written by Che Guevara to Fidel Castro in October 1965 shows the strength of trust between the two men, despite Guevara having left Cuba. Only to Castro could Guevara so openly express his serious doubts about the Congo project, given the competition between rival leaders in different areas. Congo, 5/10/65 Dear Fidel I received your letter, which has aroused contradictory feelings in me - for in the name of proletarian internationalism, we are committing mistakes that may prove very costly. I am also personally worried that, either because I have failed to write with sufficient seriousness or because you do not fully understand me, I may be thought to be suffering from the terrible disease of groundless pessimism. When your Greek gift [Emilio Aragones, a member of the Cuban central committee] arrived here, he told me that one of my letters had given the impression of a condemned gladiator, and the [Cuban health] minister [Jose Ramon Machado Ventura], in passing on your optimistic message, confirmed the opinion that you were forming. You will be able to speak at length with the bearer of this letter who will tell you his firsthand impressions after visiting much of the front; for this reason I will dispense with anecdotes. I will just say to you that, according to people close to me here, I have lost my reputation for objectivity by maintaining a groundless optimism in the face of the actual situation. I can assure you that were it not for me, this fine dream would have collapsed with catastrophe all around. In my previous letters, I asked to be sent not many people but cadres; there is no real lack of arms here (except for special weapons) - indeed there are too many armed men; what is lacking are soldiers. I especially warned that no more money should be given out unless it was with a dropper and after many requests. None of what I said has been heeded, and fantastic plans have been made which threaten to discredit us internationally and may land me in a very difficult position. I shall now explain to you. Soumialot [Gaston Soumialot, president of the Supreme Council of the Revolution] and his comrades have been leading you all right up the garden path. It would be tedious to list the huge number of lies they have spun. There are two zones where something of an organised revolution exists - the one where we ourselves are, and part of Kasai province (the great unknown quantity) where Mulele [Pierre Mulele, former minister under Lumumba and the first leader to take up arms] is based. In the rest of the country there are bands living in the forest, not connected to one another; they lost everything without a fight, as they lost Stanleyville without a fight. More serious than this, however, is the way in which the groups in this area (the only one with contacts to the outside) relate to one another. The dissensions between Kabila [then second vice-president of the Supreme Council of the Revolution and head of the eastern front where Guevara was] and Soumialot are becoming more serious all the time, and are used as a pretext to keep handing towns over without a fight. I know Kabila well enough not to have any illusions about him. I cannot say the same about Soumialot, but I have some indications such as the string of lies he has been feeding you, the fact that he does not deign to come to these godforsaken parts, his frequent bouts of drunkenness in Dar es Salaam, where he lives in the best hotels, and the kind of people he has as allies here against the other group. Recently a group from the Tshombist [pro-government] army landed, in the Baraka area (where a major-general loyal to Soumialot has no fewer than a thousand armed men) and captured this strategically important place almost without a fight. Now they are arguing about who was to blame - those who did not put up a fight, or those at the lake who did not send enough ammunition. The fact is that they shamelessly ran away, ditching in the open a 75mm recoilless gun and two 82 mortars; all the men assigned to these weapons have disappeared, and now they are asking me for Cubans to get them back from wherever they are (no one quite knows where) and to use them in battle. Nor are they doing anything to defend Fizi, 36km from here; they don't want to dig trenches on the only access road through the mountains. This will give you a faint idea of the situation. As for the need to choose men well rather than send me large numbers, you and the commissar assure me that the men here are good; I'm sure most of them are - otherwise they'd have quit long ago. But that's not the point. You have to be really well tempered to put up with the things that happen here. It's not good men but supermen that are needed... And there are still my 200; believe me, they would do more harm than good at the present time - unless we decide once and for all to fight alone, in which case we'll need a division and we'll have to see how many the enemy put up against us. Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration; maybe a battalion would be enough to get back to the frontiers we had when we arrived here and to threaten Albertville. But numbers are not what matters; we can't liberate by ourselves a country that does not want to fight; you've got to create a fighting spirit and look for soldiers with the torch of Diogenes and the patience of Job - a task that becomes more difficult, the more shits there are doing things along the way. The business with the money is what hurts me most, after all the warnings I gave. At the height of my \"spending spree\" and only after they had kicked up a lot of fuss, I undertook to supply one front (the most important one) on condition that I would direct the struggle and form a special mixed column under my direct command, in accordance with the strategy that I outlined and communicated to you. With a very heavy heart, I calculated that it would require $5,000 a month. Now I learn that a sum 20 times higher is given to people who pass through just once, so that they can live well in all the capitals of the African world, with no allowance for the fact that they receive free board and lodging and often their travel costs from the main progressive countries. Not a cent will reach a wretched front where the peasants suffer every misery you can imagine, including the rapaciousness of their own protectors; nor will anything get through to the poor devils stuck In Sudan. (Whisky and women are not on the list of expenses covered by friendly governments, and they cost a lot if you want quality.) Finally, 50 doctors will give the liberated area of the Congo an enviable proportion of one per thousand inhabitants - a level surpassed only by the USSR, the United States and two or three of the most advanced countries in the world. But no allowance is made for the fact that here they are distributed according to political preference, without a trace of public health organisation. Instead of such gigantism, it would be better to send a contingent of revolutionary doctors and to increase it as I request, along with highly practical nurses of a similar kind. As the attached map sums up the military situation, I shall limit myself to a few recommendations that I would ask you all to consider objectively: forget all the men in charge of phantom groups; train up to a hundred cadres (not necessarily all blacks)... As for weapons: the new bazooka, percussion caps with their own power supply, a few R-4s and nothing else for the moment; forget about rifles, which won't solve anything unless they are electronic. Our mortars must be in Tanzania, and with those plus a new complement of men to operate them we would have more than enough for now. Forget about Burundi and tactfully discuss the question of the launches. (Don't forget that Tanzania is an independent country and we've got to play it fair there, leaving aside the little problem I caused.) Send the mechanics as soon as possible, as well as someone who can steer across the lake reasonably safely; that has been discussed and Tanzania has agreed. Leave me to handle the problem of the doctors, which I will do by giving some of them to Tanzania. Don't make the mistake again of dishing out money like that; for they cling to me when they feel hard up and certainly won't pay me any attention if the money is flowing freely. Trust my judgment a little and don't go by appearances. Shake the representatives into giving truthful information, because they are not capable of figuring things out and present utopian pictures which have nothing to do with reality. I have tried to be explicit and objective, synthetic and truthful. Do you believe me? Warm greetings ... Evacuation By November 1965 Guevara's dream had collapsed against the reality of the Congolese forces' complete incompetence and lack of realism. Grimly he had asked Havana for help to pull out his men, though he toyed with the idea of staying on as a lone exemplar of revolutionary duty. There was an almost complete disintegration of the troops; some party members even proposed to hold a meeting to ask me to pull out. I was extremely sharp in my replies, warning that I would not accept any such demand or any meeting of that kind and would treat it as treachery, and that I would brand as cowardice even any act of allowing such proposals to circulate. I still had a remnant of authority which kept some degree of cohesion among the Cubans; that was all. But much worse things were happening on the Congolese side. This paragraph will give some idea of the limbo in which the revolution was then sailing. I will take the liberty of reproducing for you the aspirations, wishes and proposals of the whole population in the Fizi region. 1. The people demand that the military power of our revolution should be entrusted to the friendly forces who are coming to help us, until the country is stabilised. 2. The people request intensive aid from friendly countries, consisting of: a) military operations, personnel, weapons, equipment, money, etc; b) technical assistance, engineers, various kinds of technicians, doctors, etc; c) social assistance, teachers, traders, industrialists. At 2.30pm we made contact with [the Tanzanian port of] Kigoma. Our message read: Changa: [the Cuban captain responsible for transporting supplies and messages] Total men to evacuate less than 200, will be more difficult each day that passes. We are at Sele, 10 or 15km south of Kibamba. And I received the longed-for reply. Tatu: The crossing is set for tonight. Yesterday the commissioner did not let us cross. The men were euphoric. I spoke with Masengo [the chief of staff of the eastern front] and suggested leaving from that very point at night. As there were a lot of Congolese, the general staff held a meeting at which it was decided that one commander would remain in the Congo with his men and we and the various leaders would evacuate; the troops who were originally from that area would remain there; they would not be told of our intention to withdraw but would be sent on various pretexts to the nearby village. One of the little boats we still had to ply between various points on the lake arrived and took a large number of the Congolese, but those who were part of our force smelt a rat and wanted to stay. I ordered a selection to be made of those who had conducted themselves best up to that point, so that they would be taken across as Cubans. For me it was a critical situation. Two men who had comprehensively fulfilled their mission would now be left behind unless they made their way back within a few hours. The full weight of calumnies - both inside and outside the Congo -would fall upon us as soon as we left. My troops were a mixed bunch, and my investigations suggested that I could extract up to 20 to follow me, this time with knitted brows. And then what would I do? All the leaders were pulling out, the peasants were displaying ever greater hostility towards us. But I was deeply pained at the thought of simply departing as we had come, leaving behind defenceless peasants and armed men whose poor battle sense left them effectively defenceless, defeated and with a feeling of betrayal. For me, to stay in the Congo was not a sacrifice - not for a year, or even for the five years with which I had scared my men. It was part of a concept of struggle that had fully taken shape in my brain. I could reasonably expect six or eight men to accompany me without furrowed brows. But the rest would do it as a duty, either towards me personally, or as a moral duty to the revolution; I would be sacrificing people who could not muster any enthusiasm to fight. In reality, the thought of remaining in the Congo continued to haunt me long into the night, and perhaps I did not so much take the decision as become one fugitive more. The way in which the Congolese comrades would view the evacuation seemed to me degrading; our withdrawal was a mere flight, or worse, we were accomplices in the deception with which people had been left on the land. Moreover, who was I now? I had the feeling that, after my farewell letter to Fidel, the comrades began to see me as a man from other climes rather distant from Cuba's specific problems, and I could not bring myself to demand the final sacrifice of remaining behind. I spent the final hours like this, alone and perplexed, until the boats eventually put in at two o'clock in the morning, with a Cuban crew who arrived and set off immediately that very night. There were too many people for the boats at that late hour. I set three o'clock as the last possible hour for departure, since it would be daylight at 5.30 and we would be in the middle of the lake. Work got under way on organising the evacuation. The sick went aboard, then the whole of Masengo's general staff - some 40 men chosen by himself - and finally all the Cubans. It was a plaintive, inglorious spectacle; I had to chase away men who kept imploring us to take them too; there was no element of grandeur in this retreat, no gesture of defiance. The machine-guns were in position, and I kept the men at the ready, as usual, in case they tried to intimidate us by attacking from the land. But nothing like that happened. There was just a lot of grumbling, while the leader of the would-be escapees cursed in time with the beating of the loose moorings. \u0095 Buy the book from BOL",

      "body": "<p>In 1965 Che Guevara embarked on the most dramatic of his several ambitious attempts to change the world, writes <b>Victoria Brittain</b>.</p> <p>Undercover, known only as \"Tatu\" (number three in swahili), the 37-year-old led a group of Cuban guerrillas into eastern Congo . There, several rebellions had begun, invoking the radical name and ideas of Patrice Lumumba, the prime minister at independence who had been killed in 1961, probably by Belgians, certainly on the orders of the United States.</p> <p>Few people realised in the mid 1960s how important the Congo's client government was to be to Washington, and how deeply the CIA was involved in making sure that the men Guevara was working with would fail.</p> <p>Guevara's personal account of this catastrophic venture lay under wraps in Havana for thirty years, and is only now being published in full.</p> <p>In the 1970s and 80s, when the cold war raged in Africa, and Cuban soldiers, doctors and teachers stood between utter failure and relative success in countries such as Angola and Ethiopia, this document would have been a gift to Cuba's enemies, notably in the US, which was working tirelessly to bring down such leftwing regimes.</p> <p>Guevara's version of events has an honesty which has long since gone out of fashion. His diary gives an intimate picture of the harsh deprivations of the world of all guerrilla movements: the uncertainties, the mind-torturing moral doubts, the frustrations of lack of funds and the in-fighting.</p> <p>All this will make salutary reading for the next generation of foreign radicals who, for the past four years, have been trying to change the course of Congolese history. The story today is an astonishing mirror of what Guevara saw: a rebel movement fractured into three parts, as ready to fight each other as to take on the army of the weak central government in Kinshasa, and dependent on outsiders to function at all.</p> <p>And, as in Guevara's time, the central government is only held in power by the intervention of outsiders. But, in these post-cold war times, these outsiders are Africans, not westerners. Guevara's heirs have come from Rwanda, Uganda and Angola and they are living with the same realities described by Guevara - and have even found one of the old rebel leaders Guevara did not think too highly of: Laurent Kabila, now on the other side as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p> <p><b><a name=\"diary\">What follows are three extracts from Guevara's diary: </a> </b></p> <p>This is the history of a failure.

Our message read: Changa: [the Cuban captain responsible for transporting supplies and messages] Total men to evacuate less than 200, will be more difficult each day that passes. We are at Sele, 10 or 15km south of Kibamba.</p> <p>And I received the longed-for reply.</p> <p>Tatu: The crossing is set for tonight. Yesterday the commissioner did not let us cross.</p> <p>The men were euphoric. I spoke with Masengo [the chief of staff of the eastern front] and suggested leaving from that very point at night. As there were a lot of Congolese, the general staff held a meeting at which it was decided that one commander would remain in the Congo with his men and we and the various leaders would evacuate; the troops who were originally from that area would remain there; they would not be told of our intention to withdraw but would be sent on various pretexts to the nearby village.</p> <p>One of the little boats we still had to ply between various points on the lake arrived and took a large number of the Congolese, but those who were part of our force smelt a rat and wanted to stay. I ordered a selection to be made of those who had conducted themselves best up to that point, so that they would be taken across as Cubans.</p> <p>For me it was a critical situation. Two men who had comprehensively fulfilled their mission would now be left behind unless they made their way back within a few hours. The full weight of calumnies - both inside and outside the Congo -would fall upon us as soon as we left. My troops were a mixed bunch, and my investigations suggested that I could extract up to 20 to follow me, this time with knitted brows. And then what would I do? All the leaders were pulling out, the peasants were displaying ever greater hostility towards us. But I was deeply pained at the thought of simply departing as we had come, leaving behind defenceless peasants and armed men whose poor battle sense left them effectively defenceless, defeated and with a feeling of betrayal.</p> <p>For me, to stay in the Congo was not a sacrifice - not for a year, or even for the five years with which I had scared my men. It was part of a concept of struggle that had fully taken shape in my brain. I could reasonably expect six or eight men to accompany me without furrowed brows. But the rest would do it as a duty, either towards me personally, or as a moral duty to the revolution; I would be sacrificing people who could not muster any enthusiasm to fight.</p> <p>In reality, the thought of remaining in the Congo continued to haunt me long into the night, and perhaps I did not so much take the decision as become one fugitive more. The way in which the Congolese comrades would view the evacuation seemed to me degrading; our withdrawal was a mere flight, or worse, we were accomplices in the deception with which people had been left on the land.</p> <p>Moreover, who was I now? I had the feeling that, after my farewell letter to Fidel, the comrades began to see me as a man from other climes rather distant from Cuba's specific problems, and I could not bring myself to demand the final sacrifice of remaining behind. I spent the final hours like this, alone and perplexed, until the boats eventually put in at two o'clock in the morning, with a Cuban crew who arrived and set off immediately that very night.</p> <p>There were too many people for the boats at that late hour. I set three o'clock as the last possible hour for departure, since it would be daylight at 5.30 and we would be in the middle of the lake. Work got under way on organising the evacuation. The sick went aboard, then the whole of Masengo's general staff - some 40 men chosen by himself - and finally all the Cubans. It was a plaintive, inglorious spectacle; I had to chase away men who kept imploring us to take them too; there was no element of grandeur in this retreat, no gesture of defiance. The machine-guns were in position, and I kept the men at the ready, as usual, in case they tried to intimidate us by attacking from the land. But nothing like that happened. There was just a lot of grumbling, while the leader of the would-be escapees cursed in time with the beating of the loose moorings.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502447371,00.html\">Buy the book from BOL</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1965 Che Guevara embarked on the most dramatic of his several ambitious attempts to change the world, writes Victoria Brittain. Undercover, known only as \"Tatu\" (number three in swahili), the 37-year-old led a group of Cuban guerrillas into eastern Congo . There, several rebellions had begun, invoking the radical name and ideas of Patrice Lumumba, the prime minister at independence who had been killed in 1961, probably by Belgians, certainly on the orders of the United States. Few people realised in the mid 1960s how important the Congo's client government was to be to Washington, and how deeply the CIA was involved in making sure that the men Guevara was working with would fail. Guevara's personal account of this catastrophic venture lay under wraps in Havana for thirty years, and is only now being published in full. In the 1970s and 80s, when the cold war raged in Africa, and Cuban soldiers, doctors and teachers stood between utter failure and relative success in countries such as Angola and Ethiopia, this document would have been a gift to Cuba's enemies, notably in the US, which was working tirelessly to bring down such leftwing regimes. Guevara's version of events has an honesty which has long since gone out of fashion. His diary gives an intimate picture of the harsh deprivations of the world of all guerrilla movements: the uncertainties, the mind-torturing moral doubts, the frustrations of lack of funds and the in-fighting. All this will make salutary reading for the next generation of foreign radicals who, for the past four years, have been trying to change the course of Congolese history. The story today is an astonishing mirror of what Guevara saw: a rebel movement fractured into three parts, as ready to fight each other as to take on the army of the weak central government in Kinshasa, and dependent on outsiders to function at all. And, as in Guevara's time, the central government is only held in power by the intervention of outsiders. But, in these post-cold war times, these outsiders are Africans, not westerners. Guevara's heirs have come from Rwanda, Uganda and Angola and they are living with the same realities described by Guevara - and have even found one of the old rebel leaders Guevara did not think too highly of: Laurent Kabila, now on the other side as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo. What follows are three extracts from Guevara's diary: This is the history of a failure. It descends into anecdotic detail, as one would expect in episodes from a war, but this is blended with reflections and critical analysis. For in my view, any importance the story might have lies in the fact that it allows the experiences to be extracted for the use of other revolutionary movements. Victory is a great source of positive experiences, but so is defeat, especially if the unusual circumstances surrounding the incident are taken into account: the actors and informants are foreigners who went to risk their lives in an unknown land where people spoke a different language and were linked to them only by ties of proletarian internationalism, so that a method not practised in modern wars of liberation was thereby inaugurated. These notes will be published some time after they were dictated, and it may be that the author will no longer be able to take responsibility for what is said in them. More correctly, this is the history of a decomposition. When we arrived on Congolese soil, the revolution was in a period of reflux; then a number of incidents occurred which brought about its final regression, at this time and place at least, in the immense field of struggle that is the Congo. The most interesting aspect here is not the story of the decomposition of the Congolese revolution, whose causes and key features are too profound to be all encompassed from my particular vantage point, but rather the decomposition of our own fighting morale, since the experience we inaugurated should not go to waste and the initiative of the International Proletarian Army should not die at the first failure. It is essential to analyse in depth the problems that are posed, and to find a solution to them. A good battlefield instructor does more for the revolution than one who teaches a large number of raw recruits in a context of peace... The idea that guided us was to ensure that men experienced in liberation battles (and subsequently in the struggle with reactionary forces) fought alongside men without experience, and thereby bring about what we called the \"Cubanisation\" of the Congolese. It will be seen that the effect was the exact opposite, in that a \"Congolisation\" of the Cubans took place over a period of time. In speaking of Congolisation, we had in mind the series of habits and attitudes to the revolution that characterised the Congolese soldier at those moments of the struggle. This does not imply any derogatory view about the Congolese people, but it does about the soldiers at that time. In the course of the story, an attempt will be made to explain why those fighters had such negative traits. Letter to Castro A personal letter written by Che Guevara to Fidel Castro in October 1965 shows the strength of trust between the two men, despite Guevara having left Cuba. Only to Castro could Guevara so openly express his serious doubts about the Congo project, given the competition between rival leaders in different areas. Congo, 5/10/65 Dear Fidel I received your letter, which has aroused contradictory feelings in me - for in the name of proletarian internationalism, we are committing mistakes that may prove very costly. I am also personally worried that, either because I have failed to write with sufficient seriousness or because you do not fully understand me, I may be thought to be suffering from the terrible disease of groundless pessimism. When your Greek gift [Emilio Aragones, a member of the Cuban central committee] arrived here, he told me that one of my letters had given the impression of a condemned gladiator, and the [Cuban health] minister [Jose Ramon Machado Ventura], in passing on your optimistic message, confirmed the opinion that you were forming. You will be able to speak at length with the bearer of this letter who will tell you his firsthand impressions after visiting much of the front; for this reason I will dispense with anecdotes. I will just say to you that, according to people close to me here, I have lost my reputation for objectivity by maintaining a groundless optimism in the face of the actual situation. I can assure you that were it not for me, this fine dream would have collapsed with catastrophe all around. In my previous letters, I asked to be sent not many people but cadres; there is no real lack of arms here (except for special weapons) - indeed there are too many armed men; what is lacking are soldiers. I especially warned that no more money should be given out unless it was with a dropper and after many requests. None of what I said has been heeded, and fantastic plans have been made which threaten to discredit us internationally and may land me in a very difficult position. I shall now explain to you. Soumialot [Gaston Soumialot, president of the Supreme Council of the Revolution] and his comrades have been leading you all right up the garden path. It would be tedious to list the huge number of lies they have spun. There are two zones where something of an organised revolution exists - the one where we ourselves are, and part of Kasai province (the great unknown quantity) where Mulele [Pierre Mulele, former minister under Lumumba and the first leader to take up arms] is based. In the rest of the country there are bands living in the forest, not connected to one another; they lost everything without a fight, as they lost Stanleyville without a fight. More serious than this, however, is the way in which the groups in this area (the only one with contacts to the outside) relate to one another. The dissensions between Kabila [then second vice-president of the Supreme Council of the Revolution and head of the eastern front where Guevara was] and Soumialot are becoming more serious all the time, and are used as a pretext to keep handing towns over without a fight. I know Kabila well enough not to have any illusions about him. I cannot say the same about Soumialot, but I have some indications such as the string of lies he has been feeding you, the fact that he does not deign to come to these godforsaken parts, his frequent bouts of drunkenness in Dar es Salaam, where he lives in the best hotels, and the kind of people he has as allies here against the other group. Recently a group from the Tshombist [pro-government] army landed, in the Baraka area (where a major-general loyal to Soumialot has no fewer than a thousand armed men) and captured this strategically important place almost without a fight. Now they are arguing about who was to blame - those who did not put up a fight, or those at the lake who did not send enough ammunition. The fact is that they shamelessly ran away, ditching in the open a 75mm recoilless gun and two 82 mortars; all the men assigned to these weapons have disappeared, and now they are asking me for Cubans to get them back from wherever they are (no one quite knows where) and to use them in battle. Nor are they doing anything to defend Fizi, 36km from here; they don't want to dig trenches on the only access road through the mountains. This will give you a faint idea of the situation. As for the need to choose men well rather than send me large numbers, you and the commissar assure me that the men here are good; I'm sure most of them are - otherwise they'd have quit long ago. But that's not the point. You have to be really well tempered to put up with the things that happen here. It's not good men but supermen that are needed... And there are still my 200; believe me, they would do more harm than good at the present time - unless we decide once and for all to fight alone, in which case we'll need a division and we'll have to see how many the enemy put up against us. Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration; maybe a battalion would be enough to get back to the frontiers we had when we arrived here and to threaten Albertville. But numbers are not what matters; we can't liberate by ourselves a country that does not want to fight; you've got to create a fighting spirit and look for soldiers with the torch of Diogenes and the patience of Job - a task that becomes more difficult, the more shits there are doing things along the way. The business with the money is what hurts me most, after all the warnings I gave. At the height of my \"spending spree\" and only after they had kicked up a lot of fuss, I undertook to supply one front (the most important one) on condition that I would direct the struggle and form a special mixed column under my direct command, in accordance with the strategy that I outlined and communicated to you. With a very heavy heart, I calculated that it would require $5,000 a month. Now I learn that a sum 20 times higher is given to people who pass through just once, so that they can live well in all the capitals of the African world, with no allowance for the fact that they receive free board and lodging and often their travel costs from the main progressive countries. Not a cent will reach a wretched front where the peasants suffer every misery you can imagine, including the rapaciousness of their own protectors; nor will anything get through to the poor devils stuck In Sudan. (Whisky and women are not on the list of expenses covered by friendly governments, and they cost a lot if you want quality.) Finally, 50 doctors will give the liberated area of the Congo an enviable proportion of one per thousand inhabitants - a level surpassed only by the USSR, the United States and two or three of the most advanced countries in the world. But no allowance is made for the fact that here they are distributed according to political preference, without a trace of public health organisation. Instead of such gigantism, it would be better to send a contingent of revolutionary doctors and to increase it as I request, along with highly practical nurses of a similar kind. As the attached map sums up the military situation, I shall limit myself to a few recommendations that I would ask you all to consider objectively: forget all the men in charge of phantom groups; train up to a hundred cadres (not necessarily all blacks)... As for weapons: the new bazooka, percussion caps with their own power supply, a few R-4s and nothing else for the moment; forget about rifles, which won't solve anything unless they are electronic. Our mortars must be in Tanzania, and with those plus a new complement of men to operate them we would have more than enough for now. Forget about Burundi and tactfully discuss the question of the launches. (Don't forget that Tanzania is an independent country and we've got to play it fair there, leaving aside the little problem I caused.) Send the mechanics as soon as possible, as well as someone who can steer across the lake reasonably safely; that has been discussed and Tanzania has agreed. Leave me to handle the problem of the doctors, which I will do by giving some of them to Tanzania. Don't make the mistake again of dishing out money like that; for they cling to me when they feel hard up and certainly won't pay me any attention if the money is flowing freely. Trust my judgment a little and don't go by appearances. Shake the representatives into giving truthful information, because they are not capable of figuring things out and present utopian pictures which have nothing to do with reality. I have tried to be explicit and objective, synthetic and truthful. Do you believe me? Warm greetings ... Evacuation By November 1965 Guevara's dream had collapsed against the reality of the Congolese forces' complete incompetence and lack of realism. Grimly he had asked Havana for help to pull out his men, though he toyed with the idea of staying on as a lone exemplar of revolutionary duty. There was an almost complete disintegration of the troops; some party members even proposed to hold a meeting to ask me to pull out. I was extremely sharp in my replies, warning that I would not accept any such demand or any meeting of that kind and would treat it as treachery, and that I would brand as cowardice even any act of allowing such proposals to circulate. I still had a remnant of authority which kept some degree of cohesion among the Cubans; that was all. But much worse things were happening on the Congolese side. This paragraph will give some idea of the limbo in which the revolution was then sailing. I will take the liberty of reproducing for you the aspirations, wishes and proposals of the whole population in the Fizi region. 1. The people demand that the military power of our revolution should be entrusted to the friendly forces who are coming to help us, until the country is stabilised. 2. The people request intensive aid from friendly countries, consisting of: a) military operations, personnel, weapons, equipment, money, etc; b) technical assistance, engineers, various kinds of technicians, doctors, etc; c) social assistance, teachers, traders, industrialists. At 2.30pm we made contact with [the Tanzanian port of] Kigoma. Our message read: Changa: [the Cuban captain responsible for transporting supplies and messages] Total men to evacuate less than 200, will be more difficult each day that passes. We are at Sele, 10 or 15km south of Kibamba. And I received the longed-for reply. Tatu: The crossing is set for tonight. Yesterday the commissioner did not let us cross. The men were euphoric. I spoke with Masengo [the chief of staff of the eastern front] and suggested leaving from that very point at night. As there were a lot of Congolese, the general staff held a meeting at which it was decided that one commander would remain in the Congo with his men and we and the various leaders would evacuate; the troops who were originally from that area would remain there; they would not be told of our intention to withdraw but would be sent on various pretexts to the nearby village. One of the little boats we still had to ply between various points on the lake arrived and took a large number of the Congolese, but those who were part of our force smelt a rat and wanted to stay.

It is a thorough yet concise guide to a groundsman's year and the start of a concerted attempt to address the biggest problem afflicting the development of young cricketers who are asked to learn the game in conditions which are cricket's equivalent of David Beckham practising free-kicks with a pig's bladder. </p> <p>As a sort of mission statement, it identifies the qualities of a good first-day pitch: dry, firm, true, pacey and with even bounce. This is nirvana. Any decent batsman will tell you that up to a point technique and courage can cope in the absence of any of the first four elements. But uneven bounce, when exaggerated by the fastest bowlers, is a nightmare reducing the game to a lottery. </p> <p>We talk blithely of variable bounce as if there was a single cause, which is not the case. As an appendix to the board's document, and with Headingley's roller coaster looming, here is a cut-out-and-keep guide to chin music and shooters. </p> <p><strong> The Corrugated Roof</strong><br> </p> <p> It means that the pitch itself is not flat from the outset but is either concave, domed or rippled. Graham Gooch has talked about the Sabina Park pitch of 1986, when he faced the fastest bowling of his career from Patrick Patterson. The ball, he said, came through higher than normal from a length because the pitch was crowned towards one end and it was hitting an upslope. </p> <p>The famous Lord's ridge of the 60s was the opposite, where the surface dipped in the middle perhaps through uneven rolling. Anyone who has seen a cloudburst over the ground and watched the water channel down the centre of the square will understand. Most notorious of all, though, was the Sabina pitch of two years ago, which resembled a gentle swell on the ocean. The match was abandoned after 54 minutes with no lasting casualties. Someone could have been maimed. </p> <p><strong> The Cabbage Patch</strong><br> </p> <p> When England played West Indies at Edgbaston in 1995, the first ball of the match from Curtly Ambrose pitched on a good length, shot over the head of a startled Mike Atherton and thumped one bounce into the sightscreen. It was a disaster, caused by the groundsman (known as Rawhide because he was always rollin', rollin', rollin') compacting the surface so hard in pursuit of pace that vegetation could surface only through cracks. </p> <p>The result was a largely bare pitch with what looked like heads of broccoli at intervals. If the ball hit the near side of one of these it would climb. From the far side it would shoot. Hit the top and it came through normally but at a faster pace than deliveries that hit the bare patches. </p> <p><strong> The Golf Ball</strong><br> </p> <p> Remember The Wanderers last year and England's disastrous start to the series against South Africa? The pitch had been watered and was clammy and soft to the touch. In such conditions the ball, on pitching, leaves an indentation in the surface so that after a day's play the pitch becomes dimpled like a golf ball. If the surface then dries out and hardens up, these become lethal as the ball flies unpredictably depending on which part of dimple it lands on. </p> <p><strong> The Crazy Paving</strong><br> </p> <p> Depending on the constituency of the soil, a pitch may be expected to crack sooner or later, and often from the start, to a degree varying with the clay content. The more clay, the more likely is shrinkage. Often the cracks can be harmless. The Waca in Perth, for instance, is often lacerated with cracks which get wider (was it David Gower who managed to stand his bat up in one?) but seem not to affect the bounce of the ball. The key is whether the surface is firm and whether the edges of the cracks hold together. Often small platelets a couple of inches across can move as the ball pitches. On other occasions the edge of a crack may crumble. It is the low bounce that tends to cause the problems in such circumstances late in the match. </p> <p><strong> The Victoria Sponge</strong><br> </p> <p> Raymond Illingworth had a theory about the vagaries of the Headingley pitch. Over the years, he said, there had built up various layers of top dressing and these had failed to blend into one another, so one was separating from another, lending an unequal resilience to the pitch. If the ball hit a harder part, it bounced more than from a softer area. It might be a sound theory for the Headingley Test pitch has played better since it was relaid.</p>",

The Golf Ball Remember The Wanderers last year and England's disastrous start to the series against South Africa? The pitch had been watered and was clammy and soft to the touch. In such conditions the ball, on pitching, leaves an indentation in the surface so that after a day's play the pitch becomes dimpled like a golf ball. If the surface then dries out and hardens up, these become lethal as the ball flies unpredictably depending on which part of dimple it lands on. The Crazy Paving Depending on the constituency of the soil, a pitch may be expected to crack sooner or later, and often from the start, to a degree varying with the clay content. The more clay, the more likely is shrinkage. Often the cracks can be harmless. The Waca in Perth, for instance, is often lacerated with cracks which get wider (was it David Gower who managed to stand his bat up in one?) but seem not to affect the bounce of the ball. The key is whether the surface is firm and whether the edges of the cracks hold together. Often small platelets a couple of inches across can move as the ball pitches. On other occasions the edge of a crack may crumble. It is the low bounce that tends to cause the problems in such circumstances late in the match. The Victoria Sponge Raymond Illingworth had a theory about the vagaries of the Headingley pitch. Over the years, he said, there had built up various layers of top dressing and these had failed to blend into one another, so one was separating from another, lending an unequal resilience to the pitch. If the ball hit a harder part, it bounced more than from a softer area. It might be a sound theory for the Headingley Test pitch has played better since it was relaid.",

In that case he has recovered remarkably well. The new slimline Freddie looks in wonderful shape, his neck and his waistline noticeably trimmer. The 10lb shed so far, to leave him a touch over 17st, has done him a power of good. </p> <p>\"When it all started I hardly went out for a fortnight,\" he said. \"I was just too embarrassed. I felt as if everyone was studying me in the street or watching in the supermarket to see what I put in my basket. I kept wondering, 'Should I be eating this?'

The quarter-final staged one of the finest one-day knocks for years. Viv Richards muttered about \"potential greatness\" and David Gower breathed \"awesome\" at an unbeaten 135 from 110 balls which was conveniently depicted as the innings of an offended man. </p> <p>\"Not really,\" he said. \"I was in lousy form in the nets, dropped a catch at slip and didn't feel too good when I went out to bat. But Alex Tudor helped me on my way with a leg-stump half-volley and the feet began to move.\" No county loathes defeat more than Surrey but Tudor and Ben Hollioake, colleagues at England Under-19 level, were impressed enough to offer him high-fives once the massacre was complete. </p> <p>Flintoff has even developed an appetite for diets, being on two. He has won a five-figure sponsorship deal from the Rotation Diet, which aims to quicken his metabolism, and so burn off excess fat, with the help of three herbal capsules a day. He is also following the Hay Diet, which rules that carbohydrates and proteins should not be mixed at the same meal. He talks of feeling \"bouncy and full of energy\". He would be a natural to attempt three Shredded Wheat, although that might be taking his suffering too far. </p> <p>For alcohol an occasional glass of white wine now suffices. He was also forced to change his breakfast habits earlier in the season, when Lancashire's coach Bobby Simpson objected to last-minute dashes on to the team bus with mounds of bacon bursting from a hastily buttered roll. </p> <p>It is shot selection, though, as much as food selection that will judge whether Flintoff can achieve greatness; mental sharpness as much as body tone. Critics wonder about his technique against the short ball. But he remains comfortable with his game, relaxing into it like he might flop on to the sofa for a night's telly. </p> <p>\"My gameplan is simple, I hit straight,\" he said. \"People look at your strengths and describe what is left as your weakness. But I haven't been dismissed too much against the short ball.

He loyally proclaims himself as a genuine all-rounder, just as England want him to, but a back injury that has remained problematic for eight years questions whether his cumbersome, admittedly pacy, bowling style is doing him irreparable damage. </p> <p>Flintoff had what he estimates as his ninth cortisone injection on Thursday morning. He is only 22. He was reluctant, Lancashire were reluctant but England contended that this one was different and would help get to the root of the problem. Freddie has given up beer and beefburgers.

For the time being his services and those of any other spinner will be superfluous when the side for the fourth Test at Headingley is announced tomorrow. </p> <p>Since it was relaid a few years ago, Headingley has not been quite the capricious surface that it once was, when seamers held sway. But it still responds to the atmospheric conditions as few other grounds do with the pace bowlers dominating. In four of the last five Tests there, England have gone into the match with the perceived security of a spinner - Ian Salisbury against South Africa and before him Croft, Richard Illingworth and Phil Tufnell - and they have taken just three wickets between them, with another going to Graeme Hick. These represent the only wickets by an England spinner among the 114 taken at Headingley during the last decade. For this match, one that promises a result, England will be looking to rely on seam once more with an effort to bolster the batting even further by playing a seventh batsman or an all-rounder, Andy Flintoff, who can bowl some pace. Such spin as is needed can come from Vaughan. </p> <p>In the past England have made selectorial errors by choosing bowlers for their ability to move the ball - Mike Smith and Phil Newport spring to mind - rather than those who bowl straight and allow the pitch to provide the movement. However much the pitch has changed, though, it still demands the same qualities, and it will be instructive to see how Andy Caddick, in particular, responds to the expectation of wicket-taking. </p> <p>The role of a fourth seamer will need discussion for if White's forte is reverse swing, that may not be what is required. However, he did bowl beautifully at times to the many West Indies left-handers, especially from around the wicket. The likeliest scenario is that a fifth seamer will be added to the squad, either Matthew Hoggard, whose home ground Headingley is, Alan Mullally, who is enjoying a run of form, or even the old dog Angus Fraser strictly as a one-off. </p> <p>There is a feeling that Hick would simply come back into the side at seven. But it is hard to see what he can offer there now that he could not earlier when higher up the order. The selectors may not want to blood more new talent - and 18 players in a summer is already more than adequate - so the best solution might be to revert to Flintoff, already lighter and keener, aware of his responsibilities to himself and working hard at the technical deficiencies. </p> <p>Judge Edwin King, head of a commission of inquiry into the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal, submitted an interim report to the South African government yesterday, but made no recommendations for disciplinary action. The United Cricket Board of South Africa has scheduled a disciplinary hearing for three other players, Herschelle Gibbs, Henry Williams and Pieter Strydom, in Johannesburg next Saturday.</p>",

The selectors may not want to blood more new talent - and 18 players in a summer is already more than adequate - so the best solution might be to revert to Flintoff, already lighter and keener, aware of his responsibilities to himself and working hard at the technical deficiencies. Judge Edwin King, head of a commission of inquiry into the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal, submitted an interim report to the South African government yesterday, but made no recommendations for disciplinary action. The United Cricket Board of South Africa has scheduled a disciplinary hearing for three other players, Herschelle Gibbs, Henry Williams and Pieter Strydom, in Johannesburg next Saturday.",

      "body": "<p>Matt Barrett is the big boss of the big bank for the big world. The chief executive of Barclays has a big pay packet to boot. In fact, everything about the 55-year-old Irish-born Canadian is big: his voice, his personality and even his moustache. </p> <p>Yesterday, he made his bank, which really was never quite as big as its crass advertising campaign made out, a fair deal bigger. In his first major strategic step since taking the helm of Barclays last October, Barrett confirmed yesterday that he had reached agreement to take over Woolwich, the former building society, with an aim to becoming a big player in the mortgage market and an even bigger one in cyberspace.</p> <p>In his big office, where a cigarette is smouldering on a big ashtray, smooth-talking Barrett is having trouble remembering when he last went to sleep. The nature of the City when big deals are being done, especially one that leaked as his did, means that time is precious and the demands of lawyers and investment bankers ensure that chief executives get little time to themselves when the delicate final details are being put together.</p> <p>Barrett, unknown in Britain until recently, is in good humour although flagging just a little. Already, he has talked to City analysts, held a press conference, given radio and telephone interviews and been photographed more times than he can remember. Pulling at his cheeks, aching from so much smiling at the camera, talking suddenly seems the preferred option.</p> <p>Since arriving in Britain in October from Canada, where he lived for the best part of 30 years, to take the helm he acknowledges that Barclays has had a few \"bumps\". From cash machine charges, branch closures and the potential size of Barrett\u00d5s pay deal, the bank seemed unable to get anything right in the public\u00d5s eyes. The situation was made worse by the \"big\" advertising campaign, which Barrett describes as \"an unfortunate confluence of events\".</p> <p>The advertising campaigns, featuring films stars such as Sir Anthony Hopkins, were not intended to portray Barclays as bragging about its size, says Barrett. Taken on their own, away from the controversy that was simmering away, they were supposed to show that \"big is also friendly\".</p> <p>With uncharacteristic understatement, Barrett acknowledges \"perhaps it wasn\u00d5t the greatest positioning\" as they reinforce the bank\u00d5s apparent insensitivity. Branches were being closed in rural communities where the bank was often the last one left on the high street, wreaths were hung above some branches and the negative publicity machine raged out of control.</p> <p>The ad\u00d5s message, though, was that as a big bank, Barclays had an array of talent, \"a richness\" to do things for its customers that smaller banks might not be able to.</p> <p>Tanned and immaculately dressed, Barrett\u00d5s good-natured banter is tempered slightly when discussing the image Barclays has battled with during his 10 months in charge. Perhaps, his critics have said, he should have taken a tougher stance with his managers earlier than he did to try to nip the disasters in the bud sooner.</p> <p>\"The train was still going through the station,\" he says, as he tries to explain that he could not just storm into Barclays and demand changes from the moment he arrived. Barclays has lost two chief executives in the space of a year, one of whom lasted only a day in job.</p> <p>Second choice as chief executive, Barrett had to get know the bank and put it in the context of Europe\u00d5s financial services, and not the north American market with which he was more familiar. \"Part of the leadership challenge is giving direction and change. I\u00d5d like to have gotten all that in place earlier... but no regrets,\" he says.</p> <p>He was only appointed chief executive after Michael O\u00d5Neill, a former American marine, resigned after one day in the job on health grounds. The bank had seemed to take a long time to find Mr O\u00d5Neill as the replacement for ex-Etonian Martin Taylor who walked out after a board room rift.</p> <p>In all, Barclays was run by its chairman Sir Peter Middleton, who added the chief executive title to his role, for almost a year before Barrett arrived. The City was anxious for action from a bank that appeared to be in danger of losing ground at a time when NatWest, its closest rival on the high street, was being assaulted by two Scottish banks half its size. The outcome of the battle propelled Royal Bank of Scotland above Barclays in terms of its stock market size and, without the Woolwich deal, left Barclays in real risk of being relegated to fourth place between HSBC, the Royal Bank and Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>While Barrett was Barclays\u00d5 second attempt at finding a chief executive, many City sources believe that Woolwich was Barrett\u00d5s second choice too. He is enigmatic when asked whether he had really tried to persuade Ian Harley, the dour Scottish chief executive of Abbey National, to sell out to Barclays just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>\"Woolwich is head and shoulders above its peer group in the UK,\" he says. \"One studied the competition. From our point of view they were the number one. We felt great we got together.\"</p> <p>The Woolwich deal is the beginning of a new chapter for Barclays. The poor publicity, the insensitive branch closures and cash machine charges are all in the past. The Woolwich deal is \"about the future\". There is a new injection of management \"folk\" from the Woolwich, including John Stewart, its chief executive who is to become deputy chief executive of Barclays, a new \"radical\" strategy approved by the Barclays board.</p> <p>\"Customer friendly\" is the bank\u00d5s new mantra, he insists. \"It sounds trite but it\u00d5s really a good ethos,\" he says. \"The most important piece of real estate in the organisation is the three feet between front line personnel and the customers. You succeed or fail on the service to the customer.\" He admits to \"agonising\" over why it is \"no one loves bankers\". \"It\u00d5s because there\u00d5s nothing inherently pleasing about going to a bank,\" he adds. It might also be because bankers rarely do little to help themselves. At times Barrett himself has sounded insensitive, telling a panel of MPs he was \"a bargain\" and side-stepping their questions in a manner to which they were not quite accustomed. Even the City has had difficulty deciding how to read Barrett and deciding whether the man, who shares few characteristics with any of his predecessors at Barclays, can really \"walk the talk\" as he had promised.</p> <p>Although he sounds north American \u00d1 his speech is littered with \"gottens\" \u00d1 Barrett is Irish by birth, born just towards the end of the second world war in County Kerry. It was not a charmed life: \"I am not to the manor born,\" he explains. His only source of education was the Christian Brothers School in Kells. He then escaped to London to join the Bank of Montreal as a cashier. Within just five years, his talents had been spotted and he was transferred to the bank\u00d5s headquarters in Montreal as a management trainee.</p> <p>He began his way up the career ladder with no real intention of crossing the Atlantic again. By the age of 45, he was chairman of Bank of Montreal, and one of the few bankers to achieve such an influential position at such a young age. At Bank of Montreal, he was behind the creation of an internet bank in the US. The experience of Barclays\u00d5 own internet bank running into problems recently cannot have been pleasant. The acquisition of Woolwich, credited for its expertise in new distribution channels such as the internet and mobile phones, is expected to give Barclays a fresh approach to the internet.</p> <p>The deal has also allowed Barrett to succeed where he failed in Canada, provided no rival bidders step in or competition commissioners become interested. His dream to merge his Bank of Montreal with its close rival Royal Bank of Canada was blocked on competition grounds. He retired shortly afterwards and has tried to play down the connection between the two events.</p> <p>Along with his accent, his management style is north American too. He talks about \"human capital\" and staff morale. And despite his apparently different style to the Woolwich\u00d5s no-nonsense John Stewart, he insists there is a real bonding. With the Woolwich team on board, he has a management team which is \"best in breed\" and which would \"stack up\" against the management of any of the banks he has encountered during his career.</p> <p>\"I wouldn\u00d5t trade any of them. It does not mean any of us are perfect, God knows, including myself,\" he says. While his eyes still betray his Irish blood, he made Canada his home and became part of the establishment. He was even awarded the Officer of the Order of Canada, the country\u00d5s highest civilian order. He became a well known public figure, not just for his business prowess but for his private life. This might have helped harden him for the British media.</p> <p>The first taster that he was from a different mould to many of the other chief executives in British bank\u00d5s boardrooms, came after his appointment as chief executive last year. The tabloids had even more fun with semi-nude pictures of his estranged second wife Anne-Marie Sten posted on the internet than the enormous size of his remuneration package. His total deal was estimated to be in the region of \u00a36m, a figure dwarfed by headlines generated earlier this year at a potential performance-related bonus which might net him \u00a330m, provided the share price soars.</p> <p>Of the media, he says: \"It goes with the turf. You accept what goes with the turf.\" He does admit, however, to being frustrated by criticism from people who have never met him.</p> <p>Barrett does not need to work. He was on his way to retirement when Barclays lured him, insists money has never been his motivater, even when he started out as a bank clerk. \"I was interested in survival,\" he says. \"I didn\u00d5t know much about share options. I was just trying to pay my rent in a northern part of London.\"</p> <p>Being motivated by money can often be a sign of being \"doomed to failure\". The most important thing, according to him, is to find something that is enjoyable. \"The rest will take care of itself,\" he says.</p> <p>Barrett admits that he had always fancied a Bohemian lifestyle. He had initially thought that journalism would allow him to achieve this aim. Deciding he was not a good enough writer to win the Pulitzer prize, he chose banking. \"The antithesis\", he smiles, recalling his friends\u00d5 startled reactions during a period when 1960s were in full swing.</p> <p>But, he has fun as a banker. \"It\u00d5s really a people business.

      "bodyText": "Matt Barrett is the big boss of the big bank for the big world. The chief executive of Barclays has a big pay packet to boot. In fact, everything about the 55-year-old Irish-born Canadian is big: his voice, his personality and even his moustache. Yesterday, he made his bank, which really was never quite as big as its crass advertising campaign made out, a fair deal bigger. In his first major strategic step since taking the helm of Barclays last October, Barrett confirmed yesterday that he had reached agreement to take over Woolwich, the former building society, with an aim to becoming a big player in the mortgage market and an even bigger one in cyberspace. In his big office, where a cigarette is smouldering on a big ashtray, smooth-talking Barrett is having trouble remembering when he last went to sleep. The nature of the City when big deals are being done, especially one that leaked as his did, means that time is precious and the demands of lawyers and investment bankers ensure that chief executives get little time to themselves when the delicate final details are being put together. Barrett, unknown in Britain until recently, is in good humour although flagging just a little. Already, he has talked to City analysts, held a press conference, given radio and telephone interviews and been photographed more times than he can remember. Pulling at his cheeks, aching from so much smiling at the camera, talking suddenly seems the preferred option. Since arriving in Britain in October from Canada, where he lived for the best part of 30 years, to take the helm he acknowledges that Barclays has had a few \"bumps\". From cash machine charges, branch closures and the potential size of Barrett\u00d5s pay deal, the bank seemed unable to get anything right in the public\u00d5s eyes. The situation was made worse by the \"big\" advertising campaign, which Barrett describes as \"an unfortunate confluence of events\". The advertising campaigns, featuring films stars such as Sir Anthony Hopkins, were not intended to portray Barclays as bragging about its size, says Barrett. Taken on their own, away from the controversy that was simmering away, they were supposed to show that \"big is also friendly\". With uncharacteristic understatement, Barrett acknowledges \"perhaps it wasn\u00d5t the greatest positioning\" as they reinforce the bank\u00d5s apparent insensitivity. Branches were being closed in rural communities where the bank was often the last one left on the high street, wreaths were hung above some branches and the negative publicity machine raged out of control. The ad\u00d5s message, though, was that as a big bank, Barclays had an array of talent, \"a richness\" to do things for its customers that smaller banks might not be able to. Tanned and immaculately dressed, Barrett\u00d5s good-natured banter is tempered slightly when discussing the image Barclays has battled with during his 10 months in charge. Perhaps, his critics have said, he should have taken a tougher stance with his managers earlier than he did to try to nip the disasters in the bud sooner. \"The train was still going through the station,\" he says, as he tries to explain that he could not just storm into Barclays and demand changes from the moment he arrived. Barclays has lost two chief executives in the space of a year, one of whom lasted only a day in job. Second choice as chief executive, Barrett had to get know the bank and put it in the context of Europe\u00d5s financial services, and not the north American market with which he was more familiar. \"Part of the leadership challenge is giving direction and change. I\u00d5d like to have gotten all that in place earlier... but no regrets,\" he says. He was only appointed chief executive after Michael O\u00d5Neill, a former American marine, resigned after one day in the job on health grounds. The bank had seemed to take a long time to find Mr O\u00d5Neill as the replacement for ex-Etonian Martin Taylor who walked out after a board room rift. In all, Barclays was run by its chairman Sir Peter Middleton, who added the chief executive title to his role, for almost a year before Barrett arrived. The City was anxious for action from a bank that appeared to be in danger of losing ground at a time when NatWest, its closest rival on the high street, was being assaulted by two Scottish banks half its size. The outcome of the battle propelled Royal Bank of Scotland above Barclays in terms of its stock market size and, without the Woolwich deal, left Barclays in real risk of being relegated to fourth place between HSBC, the Royal Bank and Lloyds TSB. While Barrett was Barclays\u00d5 second attempt at finding a chief executive, many City sources believe that Woolwich was Barrett\u00d5s second choice too. He is enigmatic when asked whether he had really tried to persuade Ian Harley, the dour Scottish chief executive of Abbey National, to sell out to Barclays just a few weeks ago. \"Woolwich is head and shoulders above its peer group in the UK,\" he says. \"One studied the competition. From our point of view they were the number one. We felt great we got together.\" The Woolwich deal is the beginning of a new chapter for Barclays. The poor publicity, the insensitive branch closures and cash machine charges are all in the past. The Woolwich deal is \"about the future\". There is a new injection of management \"folk\" from the Woolwich, including John Stewart, its chief executive who is to become deputy chief executive of Barclays, a new \"radical\" strategy approved by the Barclays board. \"Customer friendly\" is the bank\u00d5s new mantra, he insists. \"It sounds trite but it\u00d5s really a good ethos,\" he says. \"The most important piece of real estate in the organisation is the three feet between front line personnel and the customers. You succeed or fail on the service to the customer.\" He admits to \"agonising\" over why it is \"no one loves bankers\". \"It\u00d5s because there\u00d5s nothing inherently pleasing about going to a bank,\" he adds. It might also be because bankers rarely do little to help themselves. At times Barrett himself has sounded insensitive, telling a panel of MPs he was \"a bargain\" and side-stepping their questions in a manner to which they were not quite accustomed. Even the City has had difficulty deciding how to read Barrett and deciding whether the man, who shares few characteristics with any of his predecessors at Barclays, can really \"walk the talk\" as he had promised. Although he sounds north American \u00d1 his speech is littered with \"gottens\" \u00d1 Barrett is Irish by birth, born just towards the end of the second world war in County Kerry. It was not a charmed life: \"I am not to the manor born,\" he explains. His only source of education was the Christian Brothers School in Kells. He then escaped to London to join the Bank of Montreal as a cashier. Within just five years, his talents had been spotted and he was transferred to the bank\u00d5s headquarters in Montreal as a management trainee. He began his way up the career ladder with no real intention of crossing the Atlantic again. By the age of 45, he was chairman of Bank of Montreal, and one of the few bankers to achieve such an influential position at such a young age. At Bank of Montreal, he was behind the creation of an internet bank in the US. The experience of Barclays\u00d5 own internet bank running into problems recently cannot have been pleasant. The acquisition of Woolwich, credited for its expertise in new distribution channels such as the internet and mobile phones, is expected to give Barclays a fresh approach to the internet. The deal has also allowed Barrett to succeed where he failed in Canada, provided no rival bidders step in or competition commissioners become interested. His dream to merge his Bank of Montreal with its close rival Royal Bank of Canada was blocked on competition grounds. He retired shortly afterwards and has tried to play down the connection between the two events. Along with his accent, his management style is north American too. He talks about \"human capital\" and staff morale. And despite his apparently different style to the Woolwich\u00d5s no-nonsense John Stewart, he insists there is a real bonding. With the Woolwich team on board, he has a management team which is \"best in breed\" and which would \"stack up\" against the management of any of the banks he has encountered during his career. \"I wouldn\u00d5t trade any of them. It does not mean any of us are perfect, God knows, including myself,\" he says. While his eyes still betray his Irish blood, he made Canada his home and became part of the establishment. He was even awarded the Officer of the Order of Canada, the country\u00d5s highest civilian order. He became a well known public figure, not just for his business prowess but for his private life. This might have helped harden him for the British media. The first taster that he was from a different mould to many of the other chief executives in British bank\u00d5s boardrooms, came after his appointment as chief executive last year. The tabloids had even more fun with semi-nude pictures of his estranged second wife Anne-Marie Sten posted on the internet than the enormous size of his remuneration package. His total deal was estimated to be in the region of \u00a36m, a figure dwarfed by headlines generated earlier this year at a potential performance-related bonus which might net him \u00a330m, provided the share price soars. Of the media, he says: \"It goes with the turf. You accept what goes with the turf.\" He does admit, however, to being frustrated by criticism from people who have never met him. Barrett does not need to work. He was on his way to retirement when Barclays lured him, insists money has never been his motivater, even when he started out as a bank clerk. \"I was interested in survival,\" he says. \"I didn\u00d5t know much about share options. I was just trying to pay my rent in a northern part of London.\" Being motivated by money can often be a sign of being \"doomed to failure\". The most important thing, according to him, is to find something that is enjoyable. \"The rest will take care of itself,\" he says. Barrett admits that he had always fancied a Bohemian lifestyle. He had initially thought that journalism would allow him to achieve this aim. Deciding he was not a good enough writer to win the Pulitzer prize, he chose banking. \"The antithesis\", he smiles, recalling his friends\u00d5 startled reactions during a period when 1960s were in full swing. But, he has fun as a banker. \"It\u00d5s really a people business. You deal with money and people\u00d5s money. You see people at times of great triumph and great crisis,\" he says. The Bohemian streak, however, is only temporarily repressed. Just as he was being persuaded to take the role at Barclays, Barrett was looking for a new home in Mexico where, again, he was going to give writing another try. \"Banking seems to be my destiny,\" he says.

Then, in 1979, BMW wanted to expand into Britain and went headhunting in Coventry. \"A colleague of mine was called for an interview and said why didn't I come with him and try too.\" That invitation proved a turning point. \"He was wearing a blue shirt they didn't like, as I found out later. I got the job and he didn't.\" This attention to image did not go unnoticed. He says it took just two weeks from the interview to go from an industry dinosaur to a new entrant with enormous potential. At the time, he says, BMW were selling some 8,000 cars a year: \"Now they are selling 50,000.\" In 1984, he was hired as sales director and 12 months later: \"I got fired. I wasn't seeing eye to eye with the boss. I was out, but being single with no worries I decided to set up on my own,\" he says. He left with one important asset; the BMW GB account. The German carmaker wanted him to produce a 15-year plan. This he did, but 15 years later is reluctant to reveal his forecasts. The following year he decided to expand by taking on board two designers he was already using, Basken and Andrews. \"We combined marketing and graphic design and from that beginning our staff expanded from 15 to 50 in a couple of years.\" He admits the company \"just chugged along until two years ago\". He was bored stiff just being part of a team and bought out his two partners. \"Now I'm running the whole show and it's much more interesting. I've got a personality and the company's got to have one too.\" He still boasts BMW as a client after 20 years, so he's obviously doing something right, plus clients such as Orange and NTL. Mr Greenhill is \"really excited\" about working on a new image for Teletext in the autumn. A famous name, but such tiny boring writing, I hear you cry. Not any more. Watch out for the Teletext campaign heralding a new lease of life after digital TV, courtesy of the years of experience of Mr Greenhill. Could this be a change of pace for him, too? Watch the coming attractions.",

      "body": "<p>There is a space crisis in the south-east - homeowners are being squeezed. But it's not the lack of land for new homes that is causing the problem, but the dearth of storage.</p> <p>Estate agents FPD Savills blame the space shortage on our fervour for converting traditional storage space into living rooms. Fewer and fewer attics are doing the job they were designed for; they are now bedrooms, offices, spare rooms and extra bathrooms.</p> <p>According to Fiona O'Callaghan of FPD Savills research department, they find conversions cheaper than moving into a bigger property. \"But the knock-on effect is that people are literally running out of space.\"</p> <p>Increasingly, crowded households struggling to store granny's bureau and 150 easy-listening albums are turning to self-storage companies to help them solve their space problems.</p> <p>Self-storage is huge in America and is now making forays into the UK. The market has mushroomed in the past 12 months, particularly in London and the south- east, where two-thirds of the 110 storage centres owned by the eight market leaders are located, say FPD Savills.</p> <p>Containerised storage used to be the only alternative to the pile-it-high warehouses, but this, too, has its disadvantages, says Stephen Homer, sales and marketing director of self-storage company Big Yellow. \"Consumers using containerised storage usually have to telephone and make an appointment and wait a couple of days before the company retrieves their box,\" he explains.</p> <p>Containerised storage companies charge each time the doors of the warehouse are opened, up to \u00a350 plus VAT, says Mr Homer, with access available only during normal working hours.</p> <p>By contrast, new-style storage units claim to give the customer control over their goods. The attraction of self-storage is that the customer rents a self-contained unit. Companies offering the service say the units are clean, dry and lockable. The units offer customers free unlimited access - the customer holds the only key - and some are open for 24 hours.

      "bodyText": "There is a space crisis in the south-east - homeowners are being squeezed. But it's not the lack of land for new homes that is causing the problem, but the dearth of storage. Estate agents FPD Savills blame the space shortage on our fervour for converting traditional storage space into living rooms. Fewer and fewer attics are doing the job they were designed for; they are now bedrooms, offices, spare rooms and extra bathrooms. According to Fiona O'Callaghan of FPD Savills research department, they find conversions cheaper than moving into a bigger property. \"But the knock-on effect is that people are literally running out of space.\" Increasingly, crowded households struggling to store granny's bureau and 150 easy-listening albums are turning to self-storage companies to help them solve their space problems. Self-storage is huge in America and is now making forays into the UK. The market has mushroomed in the past 12 months, particularly in London and the south- east, where two-thirds of the 110 storage centres owned by the eight market leaders are located, say FPD Savills. Containerised storage used to be the only alternative to the pile-it-high warehouses, but this, too, has its disadvantages, says Stephen Homer, sales and marketing director of self-storage company Big Yellow. \"Consumers using containerised storage usually have to telephone and make an appointment and wait a couple of days before the company retrieves their box,\" he explains. Containerised storage companies charge each time the doors of the warehouse are opened, up to \u00a350 plus VAT, says Mr Homer, with access available only during normal working hours. By contrast, new-style storage units claim to give the customer control over their goods. The attraction of self-storage is that the customer rents a self-contained unit. Companies offering the service say the units are clean, dry and lockable. The units offer customers free unlimited access - the customer holds the only key - and some are open for 24 hours. Security is round the clock, with the help of staff, alarms, CCTV, and swipecards. Nearly three-quarters of Big Yellow's customers are domestic. \"They are moving house, getting divorced, have suffered a bereavement, or have a new baby. For them, self-storage is like a room away from home,\" says Mr Homer. Philip Lewis, executive chairman of Safestore plc, half of whose customers are domestic, says demographic factors are driving demand. With fewer people getting married and more getting divorced, demand for flats has increased. In London self-storage is popular with flat-owners who need space for skis and bikes as well as for beds, tables and chairs, says Mr Homer. \"It's handy if you're moving house and the contracts haven't been exchanged at the same time. You can take your family to a hotel for a couple of weeks and still be able to get to your things.\" Students are another client group: \"They store term-time stuff in a 10 sq ft unit instead of getting their parents to come and take their stuff back for the holidays.\" So how much does it cost?

Customers should insure the contents of their unit, either independently or through the self-storage companies, many of which offer their own insurance. Safestore will cover goods for 75p per week per \u00a31,000 of contents insured. The British Association of Removers has tips for those seeking storage on its website, www.bar.co.uk.

      "body": "<p>You don't need to be a rocket scientist to discover the meaning of the term \"step change\", which, as I moaned two weeks ago, seems now to be creeping into everything from The Farmer and Stockbreeder to the programme at Tranmere Rovers. </p> <p>No, all you need is Dave Coles of Resolven, Neath, who says it all derives from the infantry. When armies moved great distances, they marched for most of the time at a gentle pace. But then suddenly something might happen - a report, perhaps, that Napoleon was at Britain's gates, or that Jeremy Clarkson was five miles down the road in a big fat sports car - which added a note of urgency, and the order was given to quicken the pace. Sometimes bandsmen were used to set the new tempo. The same device often occurs, my correspondent tells me, in folk music. And there's also the practice of breaking step when crossing a bridge, in case you make the thing wobble - but you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that, thanks to the much publicised turmoils of the new millennium footbridge in London. </p> <p>Baffled (Prestatyn) writes: <strong> What is all this about rocket scientists? Round here we would say: \"You don't need to be a brain surgeon to discover the meaning of step change.\"</strong> </p> <p> A brain surgeon (Harley Street) writes: <strong> Round here, we would say: \"You don't need to be a brain surgeon to be a rocket scientist\". I think that gets things in proportion. Thank you: that will be 200 guineas. </strong></p> <p> And now, before I forget, an apology to the people of Hounslow. On July 22 I referred in this column to an underground station called Hounslow Heath. You don't have to be either a rocket scientist or a brain surgeon to know that no such station exists. There are Hounslows East and West: there is Hounslow Central. My old Bradshaw (1910) reveals that there used to be Hounslow Town, Heston-Hounslow, and Hounslow Barracks; but still no Hounslow Heath. One local brain scientist (or rocket surgeon: I now forget which ) says there used long ago to be a tram terminus called Hounslow Heath. But that, as he says, is no defence. I grovel. </p> <p> In which posture I somehow recall that the Greeks had a device called the <strong> ostrakon </strong> , this being a tile or potsherd on which they used to inscribe the names of folks they'd like to see drummed out of town. This practice is still remembered in our word \"ostracise.\" Could this be where producers got the idea for the wildly successful TV spectacular Big Brother, which everyone is watching bar me? I gather it involves a number of fairly insalubrious people confined in a house, with viewers invited to say who should next be expelled. I would like to suggest an alternative version, which competing TV channels may use free of charge. This would start with an empty house, and viewers would be invited to vote each week on who should be sent to live there. Let us use as an example the ranks of what used to be Fleet Street. We might start by picking people from the following categories: </p> <p>1. Those who write to outrage and offend their readers. Jeremy Clarkson would be a contender here, but I'd nominate his Sunday Times colleague AA Gill, since Gill, I discern, is clever enough to know what he's up to. 2. Writers of solipsist columns: a pretty big field, and growing. 3. Bigots who bore on week after week with about the same light and shade, change of pace, crescendo and diminuendo as the average circular saw: the top of my list at present being Janet Daley-Telegraph. 4. Proven pipsqueaks, a group in which one contender is light years ahead of the field: the Times's teenage prodigy Michael Gove, who although only 15, imperiously instructs our prime minister to give up his job.

      "bodyText": "You don't need to be a rocket scientist to discover the meaning of the term \"step change\", which, as I moaned two weeks ago, seems now to be creeping into everything from The Farmer and Stockbreeder to the programme at Tranmere Rovers. No, all you need is Dave Coles of Resolven, Neath, who says it all derives from the infantry. When armies moved great distances, they marched for most of the time at a gentle pace. But then suddenly something might happen - a report, perhaps, that Napoleon was at Britain's gates, or that Jeremy Clarkson was five miles down the road in a big fat sports car - which added a note of urgency, and the order was given to quicken the pace. Sometimes bandsmen were used to set the new tempo. The same device often occurs, my correspondent tells me, in folk music. And there's also the practice of breaking step when crossing a bridge, in case you make the thing wobble - but you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that, thanks to the much publicised turmoils of the new millennium footbridge in London. Baffled (Prestatyn) writes: What is all this about rocket scientists? Round here we would say: \"You don't need to be a brain surgeon to discover the meaning of step change.\" A brain surgeon (Harley Street) writes: Round here, we would say: \"You don't need to be a brain surgeon to be a rocket scientist\". I think that gets things in proportion. Thank you: that will be 200 guineas. And now, before I forget, an apology to the people of Hounslow. On July 22 I referred in this column to an underground station called Hounslow Heath. You don't have to be either a rocket scientist or a brain surgeon to know that no such station exists. There are Hounslows East and West: there is Hounslow Central. My old Bradshaw (1910) reveals that there used to be Hounslow Town, Heston-Hounslow, and Hounslow Barracks; but still no Hounslow Heath. One local brain scientist (or rocket surgeon: I now forget which ) says there used long ago to be a tram terminus called Hounslow Heath. But that, as he says, is no defence. I grovel. In which posture I somehow recall that the Greeks had a device called the ostrakon , this being a tile or potsherd on which they used to inscribe the names of folks they'd like to see drummed out of town. This practice is still remembered in our word \"ostracise.\" Could this be where producers got the idea for the wildly successful TV spectacular Big Brother, which everyone is watching bar me? I gather it involves a number of fairly insalubrious people confined in a house, with viewers invited to say who should next be expelled. I would like to suggest an alternative version, which competing TV channels may use free of charge. This would start with an empty house, and viewers would be invited to vote each week on who should be sent to live there. Let us use as an example the ranks of what used to be Fleet Street. We might start by picking people from the following categories: 1. Those who write to outrage and offend their readers. Jeremy Clarkson would be a contender here, but I'd nominate his Sunday Times colleague AA Gill, since Gill, I discern, is clever enough to know what he's up to. 2. Writers of solipsist columns: a pretty big field, and growing. 3. Bigots who bore on week after week with about the same light and shade, change of pace, crescendo and diminuendo as the average circular saw: the top of my list at present being Janet Daley-Telegraph. 4. Proven pipsqueaks, a group in which one contender is light years ahead of the field: the Times's teenage prodigy Michael Gove, who although only 15, imperiously instructs our prime minister to give up his job. The joy of my proposal is this: they'd be forced to endure each other's company - perhaps even, if the budget ran to it, for ever and ever.

      "body": "<p>The upsurge in Basque violence poses a growing threat to Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, as well as to ordinary Spanish citizens and millions of British and other holiday visitors. <br><br>Since ending a ceasefire last December, the terrorists of ETA (Basque Homeland and Liberty) have launched over 20 attacks, ranging from targeted political assassinations to indiscriminate car bombings. Rioting and street fighting in the towns of the Basque country are an almost nightly occurrence. A crisis meeting in Madrid this week ordered that security be tightened in resort areas like the Costa Blanca and Costa del Sol. After each murderous attack, Spaniards hold nationwide, silent vigils for the victims. But after four Basque terrorists died in Bilbao while transporting explosives, counter-demonstrations by Euskal Herritarrok, ETA's Sinn Fein-like political wing, led to ugly confrontations in Pamplona.</p> <p>Fear is growing, most of all in Basque areas. While polls consistently show that fewer than 20% of the of the region's five million people want independence, 70% now say they are afraid even to talk about politics, let alone become actively involved. Moderates in particular are targeted, as well as journalists and busi nessmen who refuse to pay ETA's \"revolutionary tax\" (in effect, protection money). Mr Aznar meanwhile expresses the fury of a nation. \"We will not give a centimetre,\" he said after the funeral of Juan Maria Jauregui, a champion of peace. ETA was in for a \"big surprise\".</p> <p>Such language presages only worse things to come. The ETA killers, thought to be only 50 or so in number, but backed by networks of collaborators, are not behaving rationally. Terrorists rarely do. Recent reports suggest a younger, more reckless generation has taken over the group's active units. They seem not to care about the consequences of their actions, nor to have any clear idea what they seek to achieve. But the vast majority of Basques would support a genuine attempt to seek a peaceful solution involving the main Basque nationalist party, the PNV, and EH, and focusing on some form of enhanced self-determination. Mr Aznar missed an opportunity during the ceasefire. But sooner or later, as the British government discovered in Northern Ireland, he will have to start a dialogue, if only to defang the extremists. Having the courage to talk is what distinguishes democratic leaders from the cowardly men of violence.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The upsurge in Basque violence poses a growing threat to Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, as well as to ordinary Spanish citizens and millions of British and other holiday visitors. Since ending a ceasefire last December, the terrorists of ETA (Basque Homeland and Liberty) have launched over 20 attacks, ranging from targeted political assassinations to indiscriminate car bombings. Rioting and street fighting in the towns of the Basque country are an almost nightly occurrence. A crisis meeting in Madrid this week ordered that security be tightened in resort areas like the Costa Blanca and Costa del Sol. After each murderous attack, Spaniards hold nationwide, silent vigils for the victims. But after four Basque terrorists died in Bilbao while transporting explosives, counter-demonstrations by Euskal Herritarrok, ETA's Sinn Fein-like political wing, led to ugly confrontations in Pamplona. Fear is growing, most of all in Basque areas. While polls consistently show that fewer than 20% of the of the region's five million people want independence, 70% now say they are afraid even to talk about politics, let alone become actively involved. Moderates in particular are targeted, as well as journalists and busi nessmen who refuse to pay ETA's \"revolutionary tax\" (in effect, protection money). Mr Aznar meanwhile expresses the fury of a nation. \"We will not give a centimetre,\" he said after the funeral of Juan Maria Jauregui, a champion of peace. ETA was in for a \"big surprise\". Such language presages only worse things to come. The ETA killers, thought to be only 50 or so in number, but backed by networks of collaborators, are not behaving rationally. Terrorists rarely do. Recent reports suggest a younger, more reckless generation has taken over the group's active units. They seem not to care about the consequences of their actions, nor to have any clear idea what they seek to achieve. But the vast majority of Basques would support a genuine attempt to seek a peaceful solution involving the main Basque nationalist party, the PNV, and EH, and focusing on some form of enhanced self-determination. Mr Aznar missed an opportunity during the ceasefire. But sooner or later, as the British government discovered in Northern Ireland, he will have to start a dialogue, if only to defang the extremists. Having the courage to talk is what distinguishes democratic leaders from the cowardly men of violence.",

US forces scrambled Apache helicopters to confront the group of armed and uniformed Serbs in two all-terrain vehicles who retreated across the dividing line between Kosovo and the rest of Serbia, the paper said. The incident took place on July 28 in the mountains of eastern Kosovo, near Serbia's Presevo valley, where there have been clashes between Serbian police and a group of ethnic Albanians seeking independence from Belgrade. Shortly after the alleged incursion, peacekeepers said they had stepped up security in the Presevo area to try to stop the ethnic Albanian UCPMB group from operating.

Officials of the US military contingent that patrols the area refused to respond to questions about the incident and Nato spokesman Major Craig Snow in Pristina said he could not confirm that Serbian forces had crossed into Kosovo. \"We've not been commenting on specific incidents,\" Maj Snow said. Serb army and police units pulled out of Kosovo in July last year as part of an agreement that ended Nato's 78-day bombing campaign of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The Serb incursion, if confirmed, would be regarded by Nato as a test of its commitment to control the movement of UCPMB guerrillas who operate out of Kosovo and have been trying the patience of the Serb military in Presevo.

The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Marco Goldschmied, criticised the present planning laws as \"arcane\" for allowing people with \"no knowledge of good design\" to submit and approve applications for new buildings. He said architects should be given a statutory role in planning, which would allow them to help developers create a \"design-led holistic culture of community-based, integrated, environmentally-viable buildings\". The new proposals published yesterday are part of a campaign by the organisation, which represents most of Britain's 30,000 architects, to be launched this autumn, calling for a \"fundamental overhaul\" of the UK's planning system. The institute called for a change in planning guidance \"to encourage the use of architects in the design process\" and for qualified architects to sit on all local authority planning committees, to offer their expertise and guidance on proposals for new buildings. Among other key proposals by RIBA were for the government to make more use of public architectural competitions before deciding on design of new developments. The institute also urged ministers to set up a commission constantly to review the mechanisms for planning procedure and to remove the anomalies that \"inevitably\" arose. The proposals come in the wake of the recent criticism of ministers by Lord Rogers of Riverside, the Labour peer and leading architect, over the government's failure to implement his recommendations for urban regeneration contained in last year's Urban Task Force report.

      "body": "<p>The UN security council has approved the creation of an international tribunal for Sierra Leone to try the captured rebel leader Foday Sankoh and others responsible for recent atrocities in the country.</p> <p>But there is likely to be considerable disagreement on who besides Mr Sankoh should stand trial.</p> <p>The court is being set up at the urging of Britain and the US, which see it as a key element, along with a more robust UN peacekeeping force and direct military backing for the government, in defeating the Revolutionary United Front, which has more than once come close to seizing power.</p> <p>\"This is a good, firm step,\" the British UN ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, said.</p> <p>The exact nature of the court is not yet decided, but it is likely to set a number of precedents. Unlike the Bosnian and Rwandan tribunals, it will probably sit in the country where the crimes were committed.</p> <p>It is likely that foreign and local judges will hear cases jointly, and that Mr Sankoh will be charged under both international and national law. This would let him be tried for crimes against humanity and for the diamond smuggling with which he has funded his war.</p> <p>A joint court will raise a number of difficulties, not least whether Mr Sankoh would be sentenced to death. Sierra Leone law retains the death penalty for murder. He was sentenced to hang two years ago, but reprieved by peace negotiations. International tribunals are restricted to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p> <p>But the biggest area of contention will be who goes on trial. There is little doubt that Mr Sankoh is the primary target, but he alone is not responsible for the many atrocities committed in Sierra Leone, nor is the RUF.</p> <p>Amnesty International and other human rights groups argue that the leaders of other groups, some now allied to the government, and members of the government's own forces, should also be tried.</p> <p>\"Although this judicial process would focus on the major perpetrators of human rights abuses, in order to end impunity, all human rights abuses should be investigated and accountability established.

      "bodyText": "The UN security council has approved the creation of an international tribunal for Sierra Leone to try the captured rebel leader Foday Sankoh and others responsible for recent atrocities in the country. But there is likely to be considerable disagreement on who besides Mr Sankoh should stand trial. The court is being set up at the urging of Britain and the US, which see it as a key element, along with a more robust UN peacekeeping force and direct military backing for the government, in defeating the Revolutionary United Front, which has more than once come close to seizing power. \"This is a good, firm step,\" the British UN ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, said. The exact nature of the court is not yet decided, but it is likely to set a number of precedents. Unlike the Bosnian and Rwandan tribunals, it will probably sit in the country where the crimes were committed. It is likely that foreign and local judges will hear cases jointly, and that Mr Sankoh will be charged under both international and national law. This would let him be tried for crimes against humanity and for the diamond smuggling with which he has funded his war. A joint court will raise a number of difficulties, not least whether Mr Sankoh would be sentenced to death. Sierra Leone law retains the death penalty for murder. He was sentenced to hang two years ago, but reprieved by peace negotiations. International tribunals are restricted to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. But the biggest area of contention will be who goes on trial. There is little doubt that Mr Sankoh is the primary target, but he alone is not responsible for the many atrocities committed in Sierra Leone, nor is the RUF. Amnesty International and other human rights groups argue that the leaders of other groups, some now allied to the government, and members of the government's own forces, should also be tried. \"Although this judicial process would focus on the major perpetrators of human rights abuses, in order to end impunity, all human rights abuses should be investigated and accountability established. No single individual or party to the conflict should be singled out for prosecution to the exclusion of others,\" Amnesty said. It will be particularly difficult to decide whether to charge leaders of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, which once fought with the RUF but now sides with President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. Its soldiers committed numerous atrocities, including rape, murder and amputation, when they fought alongside the RUF to take over much of Freetown at the beginning of last year. But its leader, Johnny Paul Koroma, is a key government ally, and popular with many civilians. Any attempt to put him on trial could further destabilise the country. Moreover, part of the British strategy has been to try to separate Mr Sankoh from the RUF by persuading other RUF commanders to give up the fight and negotiate. They are hardly likely to do that if they fear arrest and trial. One option might be to prosecute only for atrocities committed since the July 1999 peace deal, which included an amnesty for all human rights abuses committed up to then. There is little doubt that abuses have continued. RUF soldiers have raped and murdered civilians since the fighting flared up again in May, and the rebels have continued to force children to fight. The UN said that 15 child soldiers abducted, drugged and thrown into battle by the rebels were among 2,500 refugees who fled to Guinea this week to escape the fighting around Sierra Leone's diamond mines and government bombing raids. At least two of them are girls.",

With his counterparts in the US, continental Europe and Britain all having tightened monetary policy several times since the beginning of the year, he must have felt left out. By moving yesterday, Mr Hayami has also, within the narrow confines of the domestic political debate, won an important victory over vote-hungry ministers. </p> <p>Considering that the law granting the Bank of Japan's independence is little more than two years old, the latter is not an unimportant consideration. However, there is a very real risk that the bank will ultimately be proved to have scored an own goal. While in the short term achieving his long-held philosophical ambition of ending the zero interest rate policy, Mr Hayami, who thinks it encourages moral hazard and hurts pensioners reliant on interest income, may have unwittingly hampered what is still a very fragile economic recovery and, in doing so, sowed the seeds of his and Japan's downfall. It is undoubtedly true that the outlook for the Japanese economy is improving. Capital expenditure is rising and so too is company profitability. But that is largely due to the buoyancy of global demand. The domestic economy, by contrast, is still connected to a life support system of government spending. </p> <p>Consumer spending remains subdued and the collapse last month of the Sogo department store group highlights the fact that the financial system is still riddled with bad debts. </p> <p>Both the direct and psychological impact of a rate rise before a self-sustaining recovery has taken hold could prove damaging. With inflation still in negative territory, there was simply no need to tighten monetary policy now. Far better to wait until the signs of recovery were visible. The International Monetary Fund was less than enthusiastic, too. Mr Hayami's unspoken aim was probably to spur the government's flagging efforts at badly needed economic reform. But with a mandate of maintaining price stability, that is none of his business. He may be riding high in his own opinion now, but if Mr Hayami is to convince everyone else of the wisdom of his judgment he must hope that Japan's economic performance sparkles from now on. </p> <p><strong> Bank watch </strong><br> </p> <p> While the debate rages over whether the Bank of Japan was right to raise interest rates equity investors will be looking at those central banks, the US, Britain and Europe, which change their borrowing costs rather more often than their counterpart in Tokyo. There is an argument that one factor weighing on investor sentiment is the worry that interest rates may not have peaked and that stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic will remain below their best until the issue is resolved. </p> <p>Yesterday provided some evidence in favour of the interest rate overhang argument. The latest US data was not seen as increasing the pressure on the Fed to tighten the monetary screw another notch. So the Dow Jones squeezed a three figure gain yesterday, managing to top the 11,000 level. The figures do not definitively end the debate, which will continue to rage too in Britain and mainland Europe for some time to come.

The most interesting time of his ensuing \"war course\", he told his biographer John Golley, was a visit to the photographic reconnaissance unit (PRU) at Medmenham, Buckinghamshire. There, in the enemy aircraft interpretation section, he met Constance Babington Smith, who has died aged 87.</p> <p>In December 1940, Babington Smith, an assistant section officer in the Women's Auxilary Air Force, had been posted to the PRU. Soon afterwards, she set up the interpretation section. By 1943, she was heading an 11-strong department analysing photographs taken by RAF high- altitude photo-reconaissance Mosquitoes and Spitfires - and checking for developments in German secret technology. Thus, for example, did the unit locate centres of aircraft production for attack by the RAF and the US Army Air Force.</p> <p>But, on that day in 1943, Babington Smith took Whittle aside to look at photographs taken of the testing station at Peenem\u00fcnde, on Germany's Baltic coast. The Germans had flown their first single-engined jet aircraft four years earlier. The first British jet had flown in 1941. By March 1943, the first British jet fighter, the twin-engined Gloster Meteor, had made its first flight.</p> <p>The detail that struck Whittle about the pictures that Babington Smith showed him was scorch marks on the Peenem\u00fcnde runway grass. This demonstrated that the Germans, too, had advanced to a twin-engined jet - the Me262 fighter-bomber, which, in 1944, began launching limited, but devastating, attacks on USAAF bomber streams. Another picture showed \"four little tail-less aeroplanes\" taking off. These were rocket-powered Me163s.</p> <p>Five months after her meeting with Whittle, came an even more spectacular coup for Babington Smith. On November 28 1943, an RAF Mosquito flew over Peenem\u00fcnde, and brought back a picture in which she was able to discern what looked like a stunted aircraft on a launching ramp. Thus did she identify a V1 flying bomb being prepared for a test flight. Partly as a result of that discovery, the RAF launched Operation Crossbow, attacking the plants where V1s were manufactured and their launching sites in France.</p> <p>Inaccurate and unpredictable, the ram-jet V1 \"doodlebug\" nevertheless had a one-ton warhead and did psychological, as well as physical, damage. Some 35,000 were made, despite 36,000 tons of allied bombs being dropped on their launch sites during 1944 alone.</p> <p>The Germans were forced to use mobile launchers, but managed to fire more than 2,500 V1s at London, from sites in the Pas de Calais. When the V1 attacks began in June 1944, they were attacked by RAF Tempests, Spitfires - and Meteor jets. While this renewal of the blitz, so late in the war, had a devastating effect on morale, without the assault on Peenem\u00fcnde - at the very limit of RAF bombing range - the factories and the launch sites, it would have been much worse.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in June 1943, another interpreter in Babington Smith's unit had made the first identification from aerial photographs of V2 guided ballistic rockets at Peenem\u00fcnde. In August 1943, the RAF launched its Operation Hydra bombing raid, and set back development on the V2 programme for months. By May 1944, Babington Smith's section had identified a V2 preparing for launch. It was part of that process by which the section also itemised and located the new aircraft that the Nazis were struggling to bring into service.</p> <p>Babington Smith was one of nine children of a senior civil servant, Sir Henry Babington Smith. She was raised at the family home at Chinthurst, near Guildford, and educated by tutors, and in France. As a privileged young woman, she moved in high society, but she was also drawn in by the aviation craze of the 1930s, and showed her writing talent with articles in Aeroplane magazine between 1937 and 1939. When war broke out, she joined the WAAF.</p> <p>With victory in Europe, Babington Smith was transferred to the United States, on similar duties for the final stage of the Pacific war. She was awarded the US Legion of Merit, having already been mentioned in dispatches and made an MBE in Britain.</p> <p>She stayed in America until 1951, working as a researcher on Life magazine. Back in Britain, her writing career began with Evidence In Camera (1957), on wartime photographic intelligence.

      "body": "<p>Fred Harper, the Scottish mountaineer and educationalist, who has died of cancer aged 62, may have lacked the single-minded aggression and refinement of technique necessary to be at the forefront of his chosen sport. But he did far more for its participants than many who have excelled at its practice.</p> <p>He was born in the depressed little port of Stranraer, in south-west Scotland, where his family was in agricultural supplies. After leaving school, he did national service in the Royal Navy, confirmed his love of the sea and developed a lifelong addiction to both nicotine and sailing.</p> <p>Edinburgh University in the late 1950s and early 1960s was a hotbed of mountaineering enthusiasm, and Fred joined two other students, Robin Smith and Dougal Haston, the two greatest Scottish climbers of their day. With them, and an informal group known as the Squirrels - a reference to a formidable body of Italian alpinists who had operated out of Lecco and the Grigna - Fred began to explore the icy winter fastnesses of the Scottish highlands, and to pioneer rock-climbs on its summer cliffs.</p> <p>His best contributions were on the smooth, forbidding precipice of Creag Dubh Newtonmore. These were named Strapadicktaemi, Gang Bang and so on in a manner par for the climbing culture of their time, but rather at odds with the taciturn and abrupt formal demeanour Fred was later to adopt.</p> <p>After graduating in sociology, he briefly sold seed corn in Dumfriesshire, before moving into outdoor education. He ran an innovative course at Marlborough College, and then returned to Scotland, firstly as an instructor at Benmore Adventure Centre, and then as Eric Langmuir's deputy at Glenmore Lodge, near Aviemore, Scotland's premier outdoor pursuits centre. On Lang muir's retirement in 1969, he became the lodge's principal, a post he held for 20 years until retirement.</p> <p>Fred celebrated his appointment with what was perhaps his finest mountaineering achievement, the first ascent, with Dave Nicol, of the 18,000ft rock spire of Ali Ratna Tibba, in the Kulu Himalaya, by its west ridge. This was a highly influential climb, which set a trend towards the ascents of severe Himalayan rock peaks in a lightweight style that harked back to the golden age of exploration by British parties in the 1930s.</p> <p>It was, however, more or less his last big trip. An expedition planned for 1971 to Cerro Torre in Patagonia, reputedly the world's most difficult peak, was aborted, and, though there were climbing holidays in Yosemite and elsewhere, Fred's job took its toll on his sporting involvements. His compensation was the consummate success he achieved at Glenmore.</p> <p>Building on Langmuir's foundations, Fred established a centre of extraordinary quality and influence. He did this through a disciplined commitment to his work and an insistence on the highest instructional standards. He also had an enlightened appointments policy, under which he took on instructors who, regardless of their qualifications, could combine the highest levels of individual performance with a flair for communicating the skills those levels required.</p> <p>Glenmore became a byword for mountaineering expertise. It was through this reputation, and Fred's diplomacy, that the hitherto lowly qualification of British mountain guide became acceptable to European bodies of alpinism as proof of competence to guide clients abroad.</p> <p>Fred's humanity, and the incisiveness of his judgment, was apparent when he appointed Ben Beattie to his staff at Glenmore. It was a humane gesture of rehabilitation; Beattie had been the leader in overall charge of the expedition into the Cairngorms on which six schoolchildren died in November 1971.</p> <p>The same understanding and espousal of individual worth was evident in the friendship and support Fred offered Stevie Haston - the finest all-round mountaineer Britain has ever produced - when Haston's attempt to join the Association of British Mountain Guides was rejected on the grounds of his rebellious character. Despite the fact that Fred was as responsible as anyone for bringing the association into being, it virtually blackballed him for his advocacy of Haston.</p> <p>After his retirement from Glenmore, Fred continued to work as a guide in the Alps, where his unblemished safety record spoke volumes for his professionalism. He was an excellent skier, a sharp and testing conversationalist, he liked to paint and read, and the home he shared in France with his wife, Sue, always offered the solaces of good talk and good wine. The legacy of international and interpersonal understanding that he leaves to his sport is immense.</p> <p>\u0095 Fred Harper, mountaineer and educationalist, born January 21 1938; died July 24 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fred Harper, the Scottish mountaineer and educationalist, who has died of cancer aged 62, may have lacked the single-minded aggression and refinement of technique necessary to be at the forefront of his chosen sport. But he did far more for its participants than many who have excelled at its practice. He was born in the depressed little port of Stranraer, in south-west Scotland, where his family was in agricultural supplies. After leaving school, he did national service in the Royal Navy, confirmed his love of the sea and developed a lifelong addiction to both nicotine and sailing. Edinburgh University in the late 1950s and early 1960s was a hotbed of mountaineering enthusiasm, and Fred joined two other students, Robin Smith and Dougal Haston, the two greatest Scottish climbers of their day. With them, and an informal group known as the Squirrels - a reference to a formidable body of Italian alpinists who had operated out of Lecco and the Grigna - Fred began to explore the icy winter fastnesses of the Scottish highlands, and to pioneer rock-climbs on its summer cliffs. His best contributions were on the smooth, forbidding precipice of Creag Dubh Newtonmore. These were named Strapadicktaemi, Gang Bang and so on in a manner par for the climbing culture of their time, but rather at odds with the taciturn and abrupt formal demeanour Fred was later to adopt. After graduating in sociology, he briefly sold seed corn in Dumfriesshire, before moving into outdoor education. He ran an innovative course at Marlborough College, and then returned to Scotland, firstly as an instructor at Benmore Adventure Centre, and then as Eric Langmuir's deputy at Glenmore Lodge, near Aviemore, Scotland's premier outdoor pursuits centre. On Lang muir's retirement in 1969, he became the lodge's principal, a post he held for 20 years until retirement. Fred celebrated his appointment with what was perhaps his finest mountaineering achievement, the first ascent, with Dave Nicol, of the 18,000ft rock spire of Ali Ratna Tibba, in the Kulu Himalaya, by its west ridge. This was a highly influential climb, which set a trend towards the ascents of severe Himalayan rock peaks in a lightweight style that harked back to the golden age of exploration by British parties in the 1930s. It was, however, more or less his last big trip. An expedition planned for 1971 to Cerro Torre in Patagonia, reputedly the world's most difficult peak, was aborted, and, though there were climbing holidays in Yosemite and elsewhere, Fred's job took its toll on his sporting involvements. His compensation was the consummate success he achieved at Glenmore. Building on Langmuir's foundations, Fred established a centre of extraordinary quality and influence. He did this through a disciplined commitment to his work and an insistence on the highest instructional standards. He also had an enlightened appointments policy, under which he took on instructors who, regardless of their qualifications, could combine the highest levels of individual performance with a flair for communicating the skills those levels required. Glenmore became a byword for mountaineering expertise. It was through this reputation, and Fred's diplomacy, that the hitherto lowly qualification of British mountain guide became acceptable to European bodies of alpinism as proof of competence to guide clients abroad. Fred's humanity, and the incisiveness of his judgment, was apparent when he appointed Ben Beattie to his staff at Glenmore. It was a humane gesture of rehabilitation; Beattie had been the leader in overall charge of the expedition into the Cairngorms on which six schoolchildren died in November 1971. The same understanding and espousal of individual worth was evident in the friendship and support Fred offered Stevie Haston - the finest all-round mountaineer Britain has ever produced - when Haston's attempt to join the Association of British Mountain Guides was rejected on the grounds of his rebellious character. Despite the fact that Fred was as responsible as anyone for bringing the association into being, it virtually blackballed him for his advocacy of Haston. After his retirement from Glenmore, Fred continued to work as a guide in the Alps, where his unblemished safety record spoke volumes for his professionalism. He was an excellent skier, a sharp and testing conversationalist, he liked to paint and read, and the home he shared in France with his wife, Sue, always offered the solaces of good talk and good wine. The legacy of international and interpersonal understanding that he leaves to his sport is immense. \u0095 Fred Harper, mountaineer and educationalist, born January 21 1938; died July 24 2000",

      "body": "<p>Today, nature lovers may like to look out for a strange and distinctive sub-species, making its first appearance of the year across the moors of northern England and Scotland: purple-nosed, red-cheeked, clad in tweed suit and leather brogues, and with an unusual, braying territorial song. Yes, today is the Glorious Twelfth, and the grouse shooters are back. Animal rightists may get agitated about blood sports, but frankly, as a serious ecological issue, grouse shooting is a non-starter. As long as the birds are profitable, they'll be safe. It is less profitable species that we should be fighting for: water voles, bluebell woods, almost all the downland butterflies. One species, however, is so ludicrously uneconomic, and as out of place in our efficient modern countryside as a blunderbuss or a scythe, that its extinction seems assured. I am talking, of course, about the rural working classes.</p> <p>They are threatened with imminent extinction, but nobody, except the occasional loony-tune such as Prince Charles, gives a damn about them. They're not particularly cute and cuddly, they don't look good on telly, and they spend a good deal of time slaughtering small mammals.</p> <p>Country people are not, in the repulsive language of the advertising industry, \"sexy\". They do not have vast disposable incomes, they do not form highly vocal and PR-oriented pressure groups, and, shy and inarticulate in shapeless cloth caps and wellies, with mottled, weather-beaten faces, they are not exactly \"telegenic\". They'd need an awful lot of hype and spin to win support in the modern media-world, and the average unemployed tractor-driver's budget just doesn't stretch to hiring a Tim Bell.</p> <p>Now then, class: which area of Britain has the lowest average wage? You might assume it was some post-industrial wasteland on Merseyside, or Tyneside, or the Clyde. Some desolate rustbelt where the old heavy industries have died and the new information and technology industries have not yet been born. But no: it's Cornwall.</p> <p>Farming incomes have fallen 75% in the past two years. Anyone who repeats that old saw, \"You never see a poor farmer,\" just hasn't got out of town enough lately. Graham Bigwood, a Somerset dairy farmer, recently made headlines when he managed to sell 10 Hereford cross heifers for \u00a32.97, after tax and VAT. That's a whopping 29p per calf - less than a pint of milk. Three years ago he'd have got \u00a360 a calf. Bigwood describes himself as \"a working-class farmer\" - the backbone of the rural economy and what is left of our rural culture. And, as he says simply, \"We are going to disappear.\" Farmer Bigwood gets up at 3am and does between 80-100 hours a week. He earns approximately 75p an hour.</p> <p>In a few years' time, many of these people and their \"economically marginal\" farms - the small sheep farms of the wild and beautiful uplands of Cornwall and the Pennines, of the moorlands of Wales and the wide chalk downs of Wessex - will go the same way as the shipyards on the Clyde. Instead, what is replacing the traditional, farmer-and-labourer population of the countryside is. . . townies. And they are moving into the countryside at the astonishing rate of 1,700 every week. Almost half of all country-dwellers are now townies by birth. What the survey doesn't show is, equally, how many country people are moving on to the nearest urban council estate, divorced from their heartland.</p> <p>Townies are making the English village the preserve of the rich. The prettiest cottages with the loveliest gardens now go for \u00a3200,000, \u00a3300,000, or more. Their buyers are solicitors, chartered accountants, stockbrokers. As they move in, the people born and bred in the place where their grandparents and great-grandparents lived, are steadily squeezed out. The average country-dweller can't find \u00a3300,000. To earn that kind of money - yes, you may spot a certain cruel irony here - you have to work in the city. If not the City.</p> <p>B y an even crueller irony, once installed in Rose Cottage it is then the townies who are the most vociferous campaigners against any new, low-cost, and probably rather ugly housing in the village: squat, grey, pebble-dashed, and proudly boasting aluminium window-frames. Precisely the kind that the low-waged locals need to buy or rent. And so the English village - that ancient, 1,000-year-old, living, breathing organism inhabited by those who work on the land - is going the same way as the bluebell woods.</p> <p>Our countryside is going though profound, traumatic and sometimes tragic changes. And a certain type of country-dweller - the genuine type, one might say - is set to vanish. It is important to realise how recently this extinction has come upon us. It was within living memory that the countryside was still largely horse-pow ered. And sometime in the near future - perhaps 10 years, 20 at the most - there will be no tenant farmers, no smallholders, no \"real\" local people left in our countryside. The only farms will be vast, thousand-acre agribusinesses growing GM crops for the supermarkets. Wildlife will be confined to specially set aside \"nature reserves\" that you will need a permit to visit. And villages will look immaculate.</p> <p>Oh yes, make no mistake about that. There will be no collapsing sheds with rusting, corrugated-iron roofs, no rotting muck-heaps covered in black plastic and old tractor tyres, no cow- shit in the lanes as the animals go for milking. All that messy business of farming and livestock husbandry - birth, copulation and death - will be safely hidden way behind the polite facades of factory farming. Villages will be pristine. There will be no blood sports to disturb the peace of the neighbourhood, no pack of hounds in full cry across the fields, no boom of shotguns from the woods. No one will grow cabbages or keep chickens in their front gardens any more - such a disagreeable habit of those old country-folk - and dawn will not be shattered by the raucous crow of some farmyard cock.</p> <p>Everything will be pretty, orderly and clean.

      "body": "<p>Suddenly, there could be a traffic problem on Mars. The US space agency Nasa has just announced that it will send two large, wheeled vehicles to explore the surface of the Red Planet. </p> <p>The first could crash through the Martian atmosphere on January 2, 2004. The second could bounce its way to a standstill in a cocoon of airbags 18 days later, on January 20. </p> <p>But British and European scientists could arrive ahead of them. With luck, a European mission called Mars Express will have already delivered a small scientific parcel called Beagle 2, on Christmas Day or Boxing Day 2003. </p> <p>Mars is a freezing planet, but it has become a hot scientific property. Earlier this summer, researchers studying the thousands of images taken by an orbiting satellite spotted patterns in the Martian soil which looked uncannily like recent sudden floods or surges of water, even though the atmosphere is too thin, and the temperatures too low, for liquid water to exist on the surface at all. But underground liquid water raises the possibility of underground life on Mars. </p> <p>Nasa - which had been humiliated by the loss of two spacecraft in as many months as they reached the distant planet late in 1999 - suddenly had powerful reasons for trying again. </p> <p>So the agency has decided to launch two identical 300lb mobile laboratories to crawl over the surface, and explore it from two perspectives. </p> <p>\"To have two rovers driving over dramatically different regions of Mars at the same time, to be able to drive over and see what is on the other side of the hill - it is an incredibly exciting idea,\" said Ed Weiler, one of Nasa's chiefs of space science. \"I think everyone on Earth who has ever dreamed of being an explorer on an alien planet will want to go along for the ride as we explore the surface of Mars.\" </p> <p>Mars was believed to be a living planet when HG Wells wrote The War of the Worlds.

      "bodyText": "Suddenly, there could be a traffic problem on Mars. The US space agency Nasa has just announced that it will send two large, wheeled vehicles to explore the surface of the Red Planet. The first could crash through the Martian atmosphere on January 2, 2004. The second could bounce its way to a standstill in a cocoon of airbags 18 days later, on January 20. But British and European scientists could arrive ahead of them. With luck, a European mission called Mars Express will have already delivered a small scientific parcel called Beagle 2, on Christmas Day or Boxing Day 2003. Mars is a freezing planet, but it has become a hot scientific property. Earlier this summer, researchers studying the thousands of images taken by an orbiting satellite spotted patterns in the Martian soil which looked uncannily like recent sudden floods or surges of water, even though the atmosphere is too thin, and the temperatures too low, for liquid water to exist on the surface at all. But underground liquid water raises the possibility of underground life on Mars. Nasa - which had been humiliated by the loss of two spacecraft in as many months as they reached the distant planet late in 1999 - suddenly had powerful reasons for trying again. So the agency has decided to launch two identical 300lb mobile laboratories to crawl over the surface, and explore it from two perspectives. \"To have two rovers driving over dramatically different regions of Mars at the same time, to be able to drive over and see what is on the other side of the hill - it is an incredibly exciting idea,\" said Ed Weiler, one of Nasa's chiefs of space science. \"I think everyone on Earth who has ever dreamed of being an explorer on an alien planet will want to go along for the ride as we explore the surface of Mars.\" Mars was believed to be a living planet when HG Wells wrote The War of the Worlds. It was pronounced dead - geologically and biologically lifeless - after the Mariner explorations of the 1960s. But earthbound biologists have since begun to realise that life is possible in once unimaginable places, as long as there is liquid water. And there have been recent, tantalising signs that water might exist - and that life might once have existed - on Mars. A small fleet of spacecraft is destined for launch in mid-2003, when Mars makes its closest approach to earth, thus cutting fuel costs and journey times. Since the scientific payloads are more ambitious, mission chiefs need to take the cheapest route. \"The goal of both rovers will be to learn about ancient water and climate on Mars,\" said Steven Squyres of Cornell Uni versity in New York state, and the rover mastermind. \"You can think of each rover as a robotic field geologist, equipped to read the geologic record at its landing site and to learn what conditions were like back when the rocks and soils were formed.\" But there are high hopes that Europe's Mars Express mission, with a little British lander called Beagle 2, might deliver more dramatic information.

      "body": "<p>On the eve of the Democrats' convention, Vice-President Al Gore will be confronted tomorrow with an embarrassing conflict of interest which goes to the heart of the row over campaign financing in American politics.</p> <p>Desperate efforts were being made behind the scenes last night to avoid a standoff between one of Mr Gore's main financial backers and the labour movement, whose support he also desperately needs.</p> <p>On Sunday night hundreds of leading Democrats plan to demonstrate outside Loews hotel in Santa Monica, where many of their number were due to stay during the convention. They will be there in support of hotel workers who are seeking recognition of their union.</p> <p>Among those due to attend the rally are the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, who was spoken of as a possible vice-presidential candidate until Joseph Lieberman was chosen earlier this week; the Rev Jesse Jackson; and the president of the AFL-CIO union federation, John Sweeney.</p> <p>The hotel has had a long-running dispute between its president and chief executive officer, Jonathan Tisch, and the union, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees. This has led to a series of arrests of union activists and has turned the hotel into a rallying point for the union movement in Los Angeles.</p> <p>On Thursday night, a further 58 people were arrested outside the hotel.</p> <p>Mr Tisch is not only a major fundraiser for the Democrats but also a close friend and supporter of Mr Gore.</p> <p>Money is essential to the Gore-Lieberman bid particularly because the George W Bush campaign is being so heavily financed by corporate interests. This means that Mr Tisch is regarded as a key figure by the Democrats' fundraising team.</p> <p>In an attempt to settle the dispute before the Democrats arrive, the hotel agreed earlier this week to post notices saying that they will not \"threaten our employees with harm\" or \"interrogate our employees about their union activities\".</p> <p>Then, on Thursday, Mr Tisch took out a full-page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times justifying the hotel's stance and saying that its position was \"not about 'busting' unions, it is about trusting employees to make the choice\".</p> <p>If Mr Gore fails to back the unions, the labour movement may question his credentials and shift some of their allegiances to Green party candidate, Ralph Nader. He will also lay himself open to the accusation that he is in some way obliged to his financial backers. If he does back the union, he risks alienating an old friend and ally.</p> <p>\"Tisch is throwing down a gauntlet to the leadership of the Democratic party,\" David Koff, a union official, said last night. He suggested that Mr Tisch's position highlighted the issue of \"big money\" as opposed to \"working class families\", about whom Mr Gore and Mr Lieberman have made much in their pitch.</p> <p>The demonstration at the hotel is one of many street protests planned in the city this week. In preparation for possible trouble, 3,000 National Guardsmen have been drafted in to assist the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) and concrete blocks weighing 4,500kg (almost 10,00lb) have been planted across streets around the convention centre.</p> <p>The organisers of the various demonstrations stressed yesterday that they are seeking non-violent protest. They said that the difference between next week's demonstrations and those against the World Trade Organisation in Seattle earlier this year was that there was no intention of stopping the convention taking place.</p> <p>The fear has been expressed that the LAPD may try to arrest some organisers for conspiracy before the protests have even started. A total of 391 people were arrested during last week's protests at the Republican convention in Philadelphia and more than 100 were still being held yesterday. Bail for John Sellers of the Ruckus Society, one of the main protest groups, was initially set at $1m.</p> <p>Some of the liveliest debates are expected at the shadow conventions being held near the main convention.

      "bodyText": "On the eve of the Democrats' convention, Vice-President Al Gore will be confronted tomorrow with an embarrassing conflict of interest which goes to the heart of the row over campaign financing in American politics. Desperate efforts were being made behind the scenes last night to avoid a standoff between one of Mr Gore's main financial backers and the labour movement, whose support he also desperately needs. On Sunday night hundreds of leading Democrats plan to demonstrate outside Loews hotel in Santa Monica, where many of their number were due to stay during the convention. They will be there in support of hotel workers who are seeking recognition of their union. Among those due to attend the rally are the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, who was spoken of as a possible vice-presidential candidate until Joseph Lieberman was chosen earlier this week; the Rev Jesse Jackson; and the president of the AFL-CIO union federation, John Sweeney. The hotel has had a long-running dispute between its president and chief executive officer, Jonathan Tisch, and the union, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees. This has led to a series of arrests of union activists and has turned the hotel into a rallying point for the union movement in Los Angeles. On Thursday night, a further 58 people were arrested outside the hotel. Mr Tisch is not only a major fundraiser for the Democrats but also a close friend and supporter of Mr Gore. Money is essential to the Gore-Lieberman bid particularly because the George W Bush campaign is being so heavily financed by corporate interests. This means that Mr Tisch is regarded as a key figure by the Democrats' fundraising team. In an attempt to settle the dispute before the Democrats arrive, the hotel agreed earlier this week to post notices saying that they will not \"threaten our employees with harm\" or \"interrogate our employees about their union activities\". Then, on Thursday, Mr Tisch took out a full-page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times justifying the hotel's stance and saying that its position was \"not about 'busting' unions, it is about trusting employees to make the choice\". If Mr Gore fails to back the unions, the labour movement may question his credentials and shift some of their allegiances to Green party candidate, Ralph Nader. He will also lay himself open to the accusation that he is in some way obliged to his financial backers. If he does back the union, he risks alienating an old friend and ally. \"Tisch is throwing down a gauntlet to the leadership of the Democratic party,\" David Koff, a union official, said last night. He suggested that Mr Tisch's position highlighted the issue of \"big money\" as opposed to \"working class families\", about whom Mr Gore and Mr Lieberman have made much in their pitch. The demonstration at the hotel is one of many street protests planned in the city this week. In preparation for possible trouble, 3,000 National Guardsmen have been drafted in to assist the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) and concrete blocks weighing 4,500kg (almost 10,00lb) have been planted across streets around the convention centre. The organisers of the various demonstrations stressed yesterday that they are seeking non-violent protest. They said that the difference between next week's demonstrations and those against the World Trade Organisation in Seattle earlier this year was that there was no intention of stopping the convention taking place. The fear has been expressed that the LAPD may try to arrest some organisers for conspiracy before the protests have even started. A total of 391 people were arrested during last week's protests at the Republican convention in Philadelphia and more than 100 were still being held yesterday. Bail for John Sellers of the Ruckus Society, one of the main protest groups, was initially set at $1m. Some of the liveliest debates are expected at the shadow conventions being held near the main convention. These events, spearheaded by the journalist and former Republican supporter Arianna Huffington, will focus on poverty, drugs policy and campaign financing.",

They want the killing to stop and they want the militiamen off the street. \"The time is right,\" Ahmed Adan, a businessman, said. \"After a decade of hate and division we are tired of war. We want to put an end to this nightmare.\" So when thousands of Somali's took to the streets of Mogadishu last week to express their support for the peace conference in neighbouring Djibouti, it was a demonstration of collective relief that the nightmare might soon be coming to an end. The Djibouti talks appear to be on track to create a government, but public relief may not be enough to see any agreement through. All 12 previous attempts at putting back together the pieces of Somalia have failed, and it will take more than the optimism of Somali people to make the 13th the lucky one. Although the opposing power groups all want to see a government established, they want it for different reasons. Businessmen want a laissez-faire government that will allow business to prosper. Religious leaders seek an Islamic government and the imposition of sharia law. Refugees want a government that will provide water, food and basic services. The young militiaman just wants to be able to go to school. When Marxist dictator Siad Barre fled the country in 1991, Somalia fell into the hands of warring clan-based militias fighting one another to fill the political void. Somalia's cities were reduced to rubble and millions of people were driven from their homes. Millions more were killed or died of famine. The UN, backed by the US, tried to intervene and restore order, but it failed and withdrew in 1994. Sheikh Hassan Dahir, sitting quietly behind his mahogany desk while his minions bustled around him, said: \"We support the Djibouti conference 100%. People need order and discipline in their lives.\" He said that he would support a secular government, but remained certain that the Islamic courts which he set up would keep their power under a new government. But according to the faction leader Hussein Aidid this is the last thing Somalia needs. \"Of course I support a government, but it must exclude the Islamic courts,\" he said. \"They are financed by the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.\" He fancies a government with himself at the helm, as do the other warlords whose militias have destroyed this once beautiful city. But nobody is paying much attention to the warlords these days. Mr Aidid and his supporters are clinging to a lost ideal, reluctant to accept that the tide of Somali politics has turned against him and the other warlords of Mogadishu. Mr Adan and his business partners returned from exile in Canada last year. They gave up comfortable lives and well-paid jobs and have invested more than a million dollars in Somalia's first independent television and radio station. \"We felt the time was right to come back and invest in the future of Mogadishu,\" Mr Adan said. \"Somali's are tired of war and everybody wants peace.\" But every now and then the conversation drops off in the face of a fierce gun battle which is taking place on the street just outside their offices - a timely reminder that it is too soon to write off what remains of the warlords' power and, more importantly, their arsenals of weapons. Around the time that Mr Adan returned from Canada, Abdi Sabrie was putting the finishing touches to a pasta factory he had built in Mogadishu's old industrial area. Mr Sabrie has grown rich from the absence of bureaucracy but is tired of having to pay protection money for his security, tired of having to generate his own electricity and find his own water. Even the militiamen now say they want to see the restoration of government. Mohamed Farah sat slumped in the tattered armchair with a Kalashnikov rifle, safety off, lying across his knees. Nicknamed \"Five Bullets\" for the number of times he's been shot, he monotonously chewed the tight bundle of khat stuffed inside his cheek. \"I don't want to fight anymore,\" he said. \"I'd rather go to school.\" But for the vast majority of Somali's there are no ifs or buts, us or them. They have nothing to lose and any form of government would suit them. Spread right across Mogadishu wherever the space will allow, makeshift refugee camps have sprung up, comprising thousands of dome shaped huts hastily erected with just a few feet separating one from the next. Fadumo Abdukadir has lived with her eight children in one such camp for the last eight years. \"Take a look around you,\" she said pointing towards the poverty of her surroundings. \"We have no food, no medicine and no hope.

      "bodyText": "Exquisite, erotic and submissive, Japan's geisha have long been seen as playthings: symbols of one of the world's most male-dominated societies. But this image, presented by Arthur Golden's bestselling Memoirs of a Geisha, is being turned on its head by a new trend in the \"floating world\" of Tokyo and Kyoto. Confirming the transformation taking place in relations between the sexes in Japan, the geisha have started pitching their business towards a powerful new group of consumers: women. Thanks to the recession and the changing tastes of salarymen, who prefer singing karaoke in a hostess bar to listening to a shamisen (a three-stringed musical instrument) in a tea house, the geisha's traditional source of income has been steadily falling. So for the first time in their centuries-long history, some traditional restaurants have begun using the geisha to attract all-female parties. \"It is a revolutionary change in our world,\" said Shichiko Sakuragawa, a hokan (go-between) at such parties. \"We can no longer survive by relying only on male patronage. We must build up business among women. Wives, after all, control the family purse-strings in Japan, so they have more money than their husbands.\" The change is already being felt in Mukojima, an entertainment district in north-east Tokyo, where kimono-clad geisha can often be seen clip-clopping in their wooden sandals to engagements at tea-houses and high-class ryotei (traditional) restaurants. Locals say the number of customers has been falling for 10 years and the geisha population has shrunk by 20%. But business remains strong at Meigetsu, an elegant restaurant with intimate tatami (mat) rooms and a garden of bamboo and pine, where one in 10 parties is for women only. \"They are mostly middle-aged ladies who love seeing young girls in kimonos playing traditional instruments,\" its owner, Keiko Akiyama, said. \"It's a sign that women are becoming stronger, but I cannot help feeling sad for men that this has happened.\" Women customers are increasing not only because they have more money and freedom, but because the geisha world has become less about sex and more about sophistication. Golden's book depicts the pre-war era when hard-up families sold their daughters to geisha houses, where they earned a living entertaining male clients with songs and, sometimes, sex. The virginity of many young geisha was auctioned off to the highest bidder. Ms Akiyama insists that such practices have long been a thing of the past. \"Golden's book creates a completely misleading impression,\" she said. \"Japan is now a rich country and young women are economically independent. Those who choose to become geisha do so because they like the traditional arts. There is nothing seedy about this world.\" On the contrary, the danger some fear is that the arrival of women customers may signal that the geisha world is losing its sensuality and becoming more like a museum attraction. \"Female customers are welcome, but I hope they do not overtake men,\" Shichiko Sakuragawa said. \"No matter how much business all-women parties generate, it would be terrible if we lost the thrill and the edge that comes from having a mix of men and beautiful women.\"",

Yahoo argues that this is technically impossible, but the judge ruled yesterday that over the next two months a team of French, American and European experts should look for a way to identify web users by origin, and filter French users from the site. The experts will present their findings on November 6. The judge rejected demands by the three anti-racist and Jewish organisations bringing the case, LICRA, UEJF and MRAP, that Yahoo be fined more than \u00a3100,000 for each day that the auction pages remained open to French surfers.

Settling Our Accounts, a muckraking volume of interviews with two leading nationalists, sold out last Monday afternoon, hours after one of its authors died in a hail of machine-gun bullets over his morning coffee. Since bloody feuds between rival political factions and mafia gangs in France's most turbulent province can push the number of assassinations there to more than 30 a year, the murder of Jean-Michel Rossi and his bodyguard would ordinarily have shocked no one. But as France, one of Europe's last great centralised powers, edges towards acceptance of the idea that a little more autonomy - not only for Corsica, but for a few other regions - might be no bad thing, these killings could have wider repercussions. Last month, the Corsican assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of a groundbreaking package of devolutionary measures, known as the Matignon accords, drawn up by France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin. The measures offer the island's elected representatives regulatory powers by 2002 and, after a change to the French constitution by a future French government, formal, though limited, legislative powers by 2004. Last week's dual murder may have dealt a serious blow to the Matignon accords, founded on one condition: agreement between warring nationalist clans to end the bombings and machine-gunnings that have been an all but daily occurrence on the island for the past 25 years. \"Now we don't know where we are any more,\" said Lucien Pieri, a lawyer in the former Corsican capital of Corte. \"After Matignon, everyone thought we'd turned a page, that we had a workable future to look forward to.

Other heads too, tens of thousands of them, all stuck inside metal containers which give Monkee haircuts.</p> <p>Motorcycle helmets are hot, uncomfortable, and a pain to carry around, and they are everywhere: on bankers, teenagers and tourists; on bar stools, cafe tables and desks; above all, they are on Roman minds.</p> <p>Most do not want to wear them. They want wind in the hair and absence of hassle, which they had until a law in March made helmets compulsory. Too many people were dying (1,185 nationally in 1998) and the government said 'enough'. Those caught without would be fined \u00a380.</p> <p>Overnight the city was transformed. Scooter and motorbike riders looked blocky instead of zippy. No longer, though God knows some tried, could they use mobiles. Eating an ice cream became fraught.</p> <p>Politicians, footballers and pop stars posed with helmets, but it was little consolation to teenagers who pulled up at discos with gelled tresses turned into bowlers. Businessmen complained that they looked silly carrying helmets into meetings.</p> <p>The whingeing has not stopped, if anything it is louder now, because of the heat. But an astonishing fact remains: unlike the widely flouted seat-belt law, this one is being obeyed. Except for a few tearaways at 3am, everyone wears a helmet.</p> <p>In a city where rules are supposedly made for bending, it is a miracle of law enforcement. Contrary to expectations, the police are vigilant, and contrary to cliche, the natives are acquiescent.</p> <p>Therein lies the answer, or part of the answer, to a complex question: does the south of Italy begin after Rome, or in Rome?</p> <p>Ask a Milanese and he will boot the capital deep into the backward south, the mezzogiorno, where his taxes are pocketed by layabouts and incompetents with no respect for order.

      "bodyText": "It took a while to realise that the answer was curved, smooth, shiny and encasing my head. Other heads too, tens of thousands of them, all stuck inside metal containers which give Monkee haircuts. Motorcycle helmets are hot, uncomfortable, and a pain to carry around, and they are everywhere: on bankers, teenagers and tourists; on bar stools, cafe tables and desks; above all, they are on Roman minds. Most do not want to wear them. They want wind in the hair and absence of hassle, which they had until a law in March made helmets compulsory. Too many people were dying (1,185 nationally in 1998) and the government said 'enough'. Those caught without would be fined \u00a380. Overnight the city was transformed. Scooter and motorbike riders looked blocky instead of zippy. No longer, though God knows some tried, could they use mobiles. Eating an ice cream became fraught. Politicians, footballers and pop stars posed with helmets, but it was little consolation to teenagers who pulled up at discos with gelled tresses turned into bowlers. Businessmen complained that they looked silly carrying helmets into meetings. The whingeing has not stopped, if anything it is louder now, because of the heat. But an astonishing fact remains: unlike the widely flouted seat-belt law, this one is being obeyed. Except for a few tearaways at 3am, everyone wears a helmet. In a city where rules are supposedly made for bending, it is a miracle of law enforcement. Contrary to expectations, the police are vigilant, and contrary to cliche, the natives are acquiescent. Therein lies the answer, or part of the answer, to a complex question: does the south of Italy begin after Rome, or in Rome? Ask a Milanese and he will boot the capital deep into the backward south, the mezzogiorno, where his taxes are pocketed by layabouts and incompetents with no respect for order. Ask a Calabrian and he will place Rome far into the industrial north, where automata follow edicts from the state. By complying Rome has bolted itself to the north, distancing itself from the bare heads that remain the norm in Naples, Palermo and Reggio di Calabria. It is a significant breach. Newspapers and cabinet ministers have declared the helmet law evidence of Italian maturity and discipline, a respect for law and common sense befitting modern Europeans. There is a catch. Rather than endure a helmet, the mature, disciplined, sensible and modern Europeans of Rome are using more cars and taxis, worsening the already nightmare congestion. Those who stay on two wheels abandon their 50cc Piaggios for maxi-scooters with roofs and 500cc engines. Now that you have to wear a helmet you may as well be able to exceed 80mph, goes the logic. One of the monsters almost ran me over the other day. I screamed till I was blue but the rider sailed on, muffled from all abuse.",

The Ramblers' Association published an NOP poll showing that 82% of those questioned believe the government should ensure the countryside bill, which is designed to protect threatened wildlife and the rights of ramblers, becomes law as soon as possible. The poll of 1,000 people follows reports last week that senior ministers are considering moves to abandon the legislation because of the massive backlog of bills which must be cleared through the Lords in this parliamentary session. Environmentalists fear the countryside bill, which has had more than 300 amendments from Tory peers to restrict access to their land, will be sacrificed to enable other important bills - on election spending, freedom of information, policing in Northern Ireland, criminal justice and transport - to be completed. But Kate Ashbrook, who has led the Ramblers' Association's right to roam campaign, said: \"The British public has consistently supported the government's election pledge to increase environmental protection and introduce a freedom to roam.

The move follows confirmation that Trevor Masters' blue Land Rover was seen travelling through the Channel Tunnel on Tuesday morning, as he was due back in Cardiff crown court. Masters' escape, the day before he received nine convictions for sex attacks against women and two girls as young as 10, prompted criticism of the judge for granting bail to a man described as \"physically and sexually brutal\". John Griffith Williams, QC, a crown court judge on the Wales and Chester circuit, took the rare step of defending his decision. He said he had bailed Masters, 48, because the prosecution had not argued against it, and he was tied by the law. The statement was issued following fierce criticism by the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe. He said: \"It should be understood that any judge's powers regarding bail are circumscribed by the provisions of the Bail Act. \"The defendant had complied properly with his bail conditions, both before and during the trial. \"There were no representations made by the prosecution and there were no grounds in this case for withholding bail.\" Miss Widdecombe had said that \"given the nature of the crimes and the evidence which has led to convict the individ ual in question, the judge has some serious explaining to do\". Masters left his guest house in Cardiff on Monday night. Miss Widdecombe had said the case raised grave concerns and claimed there was a presumption in law that those charged with rape and serious sexual offences should be bailed only in exceptional circumstances. But yesterday the Home Office stressed that the 1976 Bail Act established a presumption in favour of bail, reflecting the principle that a person was innocent until proven guilty. Exceptions could be made only if the court believed the defendant represented a \"bail risk\" - being unlikely to return to court, for example, or to intimidate a witness - or was likely to reoffend. Even in rape and murder cases bail had been granted, with Sion Jenkins gaining bail as he waited trial for killing his foster daughter, Billie-Jo Jenkins. The crown prosecution service said it had offered no opposition to Masters being granted bail because he had complied with all the conditions set out at a full bail hearing in December. He had promised to stay in one place, not interfere with witnesses, not enter Scotland and Wales, and report to Ludlow police station twice a week. \"All the time he was on bail he never failed to comply with these conditions so, when he came to crown court, there was no reason for us to make representations,\" said Julie Seddon, a CPS spokeswoman.

Two other species brought back from the verge of extinction are the golden jackal, spotted in the mountains bordering Slovenia, and the brown bear, which disappeared in Italy in 1908. A 1976 protection law is credited with quadrupling the number of wolves in the Apennines to 400, the fastest recovery rate in Europe and enough for them to start recolonising the Alps and extending into other countries. Unlike the wolves in Bulgaria, Russia and Romania, the Italian wolf has not interbred with feral dogs and remains pure, the Italian institute of wildlife biology says.

But it has failed to draw the crowds, who were reluctant to part with \u00a33.50 for the entrance fee. It has also suffered from chronic underfunding.</p> <p>Matthew Pritchard, one of the trustees, said: \"The decision has been forced upon the trustees by the refusal of the officers of the Arts Council of Wales to work with the trustees to explore the positive way forward recommended in the independent review of the centre.</p> <p>\"The trustees regret that the ACW has shown neither the strategic forethought nor the artistic vision to support the centre on a comparable level with equivalent institutions across the British Isles.\" The centre, which will close on November 5, had problems from the outset.</p> <p>The conversion of an old library building was problematic as it had only one continuous unbroken wall on which artworks could be hung. It only received \u00a3210,000 from the Arts Council of Wales - less than half a similar project in England would have expected to have received.</p> <p>One of its successes was Unconvention, when it attracted 4,000 people over a weekend to hear Welsh male voice choirs sing the speeches of NUM leader Arthur Scargill. The total number of visitors in the past 11 months has reached only 47,000 - far fewer than anticipated.</p> <p>But the Arts Council of Wales said it first had concerns about the gallery's financial performance last November, only two months after it was opened.</p> <p>\"The Arts Council of Wales grant is its largest to any gallery in Wales. The CVA has received in excess of \u00a33.2m in capital funds from ACW's arts lottery fund and Cardiff county council has contributed a further \u00a33.1m,\" it said in a statement. \"Therefore, ACW does not have further funding resources to pass on and consequently can only consider any options outlined in the report that operate within current funding levels.\"</p> <p>Cardiff county council said yesterday that it did not want to lose the Centre for Visual Arts and would work to secure its future.</p> <p>A council spokesman said: \"In February, the council agreed to a request from the trust responsible for the centre for a loan of \u00a3250,000 secured against income. The centre have asked for a review of the repayments agreements and the council has offered to consider the matter at its next meeting.</p> <p>\"The council has made it clear, however, that any financial provision that it would consider would need to be with the agreement of grant assistance from the national assembly and increased funding from the Arts Council of Wales to place the centre on a secure financial footing.\"</p> <p>Rhodri Morgan, first secretary of the Welsh Assembly, said: \"The attendance figures make the Millennium Dome look good by comparison.\"</p>",

But it has failed to draw the crowds, who were reluctant to part with \u00a33.50 for the entrance fee. It has also suffered from chronic underfunding. Matthew Pritchard, one of the trustees, said: \"The decision has been forced upon the trustees by the refusal of the officers of the Arts Council of Wales to work with the trustees to explore the positive way forward recommended in the independent review of the centre. \"The trustees regret that the ACW has shown neither the strategic forethought nor the artistic vision to support the centre on a comparable level with equivalent institutions across the British Isles.\" The centre, which will close on November 5, had problems from the outset. The conversion of an old library building was problematic as it had only one continuous unbroken wall on which artworks could be hung. It only received \u00a3210,000 from the Arts Council of Wales - less than half a similar project in England would have expected to have received. One of its successes was Unconvention, when it attracted 4,000 people over a weekend to hear Welsh male voice choirs sing the speeches of NUM leader Arthur Scargill. The total number of visitors in the past 11 months has reached only 47,000 - far fewer than anticipated. But the Arts Council of Wales said it first had concerns about the gallery's financial performance last November, only two months after it was opened. \"The Arts Council of Wales grant is its largest to any gallery in Wales. The CVA has received in excess of \u00a33.2m in capital funds from ACW's arts lottery fund and Cardiff county council has contributed a further \u00a33.1m,\" it said in a statement. \"Therefore, ACW does not have further funding resources to pass on and consequently can only consider any options outlined in the report that operate within current funding levels.\" Cardiff county council said yesterday that it did not want to lose the Centre for Visual Arts and would work to secure its future. A council spokesman said: \"In February, the council agreed to a request from the trust responsible for the centre for a loan of \u00a3250,000 secured against income. The centre have asked for a review of the repayments agreements and the council has offered to consider the matter at its next meeting. \"The council has made it clear, however, that any financial provision that it would consider would need to be with the agreement of grant assistance from the national assembly and increased funding from the Arts Council of Wales to place the centre on a secure financial footing.\" Rhodri Morgan, first secretary of the Welsh Assembly, said: \"The attendance figures make the Millennium Dome look good by comparison.\"",

Her glass cabinet is filled with pictures of them all and her shelves are lined with hundreds of ornaments they have given her.</p> <p>There are almost always some of the grandchildren here, rolling over the armchairs, pulling out the china. Today, there are some of them in the front garden of the terrace house that lies at the back of the Paulsgrove estate, in north Portsmouth. Cavorting about, they are shouting about \"pervs\". One, Fred, covered in facepaint, shouts through the door about his mum, Sharon: \"She's my mother, the mega bitch.\" Sharon laughs.</p> <p>For the past few nights, Valerie, her daughter Sharon, Sue, who is Valerie's ex-daughter-in-law, and all the kids have been protesting against paedophiles on the estate.</p> <p>Together with other placard-waving mothers and grandmothers, they have marched up to the houses of people they believe are child abusers and begun shouting and chanting outside their doors. But they are having a night off tonight, while discussions with the council take place on how the situation can be resolved.</p> <p>Valerie is sitting on her neat floral sofa with Sharon, Sue, 40, Sharon's son, Jimmy Toovey, 15, and Patsy Lander, 11, a friend's daughter. Crawling around in a pale blue babygro is 17-month-old Ernie Toovey.</p> <p>The women are talking about the protests and trying to explain why they have been joining in.</p> <p>\"We have had two perverts living up this road. We are not just going on hearsay, the two here we know definitely,\" says Valerie. \"Then there's another one - we used to see him in the butcher shop with his little dog and we would never have dreamt he was a pervert. Until it went in the paper we didn't know that he was.\"</p> <p>The women say that the two abusers they know of very locally were both in-family abusers. In spite of this, they believe that they present a threat to their children.</p> <p>\"It's a chance you cannot afford to take when it's a child of your own,\" says Sharon. \"They are all as bad as each other.\"</p> <p>Here in Paulsgrove, a modern-day Salem, there are no greys when it comes to the delicate matter of the paedophile. There is no distinction between the mild offender and the serious one - everything is black and white.</p> <p>\"To me they are all the same. They have all done it,\" says Valerie, large gold earrings rattling as she furiously shakes her tightly-permed head. \"If any got hold of my grandchild they wouldn't live. I would do time for them.\"</p> <p>Later, this matriarch admits that the marching and rioting has probably inflamed the situation, that people have become afraid of the pervert round every corner.</p> <p>\"It has made it worse.

      "bodyText": "Valerie Toovey is 55 and has 22 grandchildren. Her glass cabinet is filled with pictures of them all and her shelves are lined with hundreds of ornaments they have given her. There are almost always some of the grandchildren here, rolling over the armchairs, pulling out the china. Today, there are some of them in the front garden of the terrace house that lies at the back of the Paulsgrove estate, in north Portsmouth. Cavorting about, they are shouting about \"pervs\". One, Fred, covered in facepaint, shouts through the door about his mum, Sharon: \"She's my mother, the mega bitch.\" Sharon laughs. For the past few nights, Valerie, her daughter Sharon, Sue, who is Valerie's ex-daughter-in-law, and all the kids have been protesting against paedophiles on the estate. Together with other placard-waving mothers and grandmothers, they have marched up to the houses of people they believe are child abusers and begun shouting and chanting outside their doors. But they are having a night off tonight, while discussions with the council take place on how the situation can be resolved. Valerie is sitting on her neat floral sofa with Sharon, Sue, 40, Sharon's son, Jimmy Toovey, 15, and Patsy Lander, 11, a friend's daughter. Crawling around in a pale blue babygro is 17-month-old Ernie Toovey. The women are talking about the protests and trying to explain why they have been joining in. \"We have had two perverts living up this road. We are not just going on hearsay, the two here we know definitely,\" says Valerie. \"Then there's another one - we used to see him in the butcher shop with his little dog and we would never have dreamt he was a pervert. Until it went in the paper we didn't know that he was.\" The women say that the two abusers they know of very locally were both in-family abusers. In spite of this, they believe that they present a threat to their children. \"It's a chance you cannot afford to take when it's a child of your own,\" says Sharon. \"They are all as bad as each other.\" Here in Paulsgrove, a modern-day Salem, there are no greys when it comes to the delicate matter of the paedophile. There is no distinction between the mild offender and the serious one - everything is black and white. \"To me they are all the same. They have all done it,\" says Valerie, large gold earrings rattling as she furiously shakes her tightly-permed head. \"If any got hold of my grandchild they wouldn't live. I would do time for them.\" Later, this matriarch admits that the marching and rioting has probably inflamed the situation, that people have become afraid of the pervert round every corner. \"It has made it worse. You are on tenterhooks all the time. It frightens me,\" she says, as she grabs Ernie, who is pulling at a white porcelain alsatian dog. The women don't have much truck with claims of mistaken identity. Sue's brother's car was burnt and his house was trashed while he was on holiday. He was entirely innocent, his name was simply the same as the man who lives upstairs, but Sue doesn't appreciate the finer irony of this. The women are trying to think of a solution to the problem. \"I want them out of here, but I wouldn't like them to go somewhere else where there was children,\" says Sharon. Her mother has the answer. She points through the wall, out towards the channel. \"They have got a little island out there - it's called No-Man's Island. Put them all there, give them no food and no drink and get each mother to go over there with a little bit of acid and burn them down below and they won't want to use it any more.

Patsy says it has made her \"kind of happy\" to know about the perverts, but she giggles and says other kids have started going round asking men \"Are you a perv?\" In Paulsgrove, they don't wait for an answer. Victim with a vengeance Katrina Kessell has been doing newspaper and television interviews all week and protesting for nine days with \"no sleep and hardly any housework done\". Now though, she casts her eyes to her self-appointed adviser when she is asked a question that is difficult. He then nods a yes, a no or says himself \"no comment\".

Last year, 2.9% of undergraduates came from council estates, up from 2.44% in 1994, according to analysis of Ucas records.

The lifelong learning minister, Malcolm Wicks, said the figures had improved although there was still work to be done.

Glance at the map, and you see at once that the streets have been drawn to resemble the bars of a radiator grille, growing from a single road called Brooklands. </p> <p>And that's the vital clue. For just as the electric Metropolitan Railway gave rise in the 20s to Metroland, a belt of commuter \"villages\" in the countryside north of London, so the car, in its turn, spawned a phenomenon known as Plotlands. In the years between the wars, the better-off city dweller with a set of wheels and a little cash to spare could, for around \u00a350, buy a modest plot by the sea, and there build - or buy ready-built - a bungalow on stilts, or a cabin made with grooved weatherboarding, painted with Solignum and roofed with Anderson's Rok-Flextile in two colours. </p> <p>During the 30s, hundreds of plots such as this were carved out of a marshland farm two miles down the road from Clacton-on-Sea to form the resort village of Jaywick Sands. There were no drains then, and no mains water. But why would cabins need such things? Plans for the structures were passed under by-laws governing the siting of tents, caravans and huts. The little houses were never meant to be permanent, you see. At least, that was the theory. </p> <p>But 30 years on, the cabins were still standing - and not just standing, but enjoying a new lease of life. This time, it was as holiday accommodation for working-class families from London's East End. When they clapped eyes on the little houses by the beach, the East Enders took them to their hearts. And home is where the heart is. </p> <p>\"What some people would do,\" says Joan Matthews, \"is rent a place down here for the last two weeks in the summer, then move in and change the locks.\" And Joan can understand why. It was 1964 when she and her husband came down for a fortnight's holiday, and it was love at first sight. The following year they were back. Then they spotted a bungalow on the market, put down a deposit, and by January 1966 they were in. \"It was pouring with rain when we got here,\" says Joan. \"We looked at one another and thought, what have we let ourselves in for? But they say if you can last one winter down here, you're all right. And, in my opinion, you won't find a better place, anywhere, than Jaywick. I like the people.\" </p> <p>When Joan moved in, she reckons the bungalows had barely 100 inhabitants. Today, there are more than 1,000, and the majority of the structures are occupied all year round. But if the people are friendly and the situation grand, the accommodation has left much to be desired. After a brief spell living in Kent, Joan returned to Jaywick and to a rented bungalow. </p> <p>As the years went by, the idyll of a wooden cabin by the beach began to wear thin. Many of the bungalows were rough-and-ready affairs, constructed from asbestos and incorporating wooden packing cases from Ford's at Dagenham. \"The floors had gone,\" says Joan. \"There was no ceiling in the kitchen, and no cupboards. There was no putty in the windows, and every time the back door banged, pebbledash would fall off the outside wall. The place was declared unfit 10 years ago, and it was supposed to have come down then.\" </p> <p>As she talks, she looks around the lofty cream interior of the place she now calls home. \"This,\" she says, \"this is heaven - and I mean heaven. I can sleep at night, I don't cough so much, and I've never had so many cupboards in all my life.\" </p> <p>Appropriately, Joan's \"heaven\" is in a new street called Lotus Way. Built by the Guinness Trust housing association as part of a regeneration programme aimed at improving economic and social conditions in the village, the development comprises 40 homes whose innovative design won a RIBA award for the architects Pollard Thomas and Edwards. With back-sloping roofs and walls clad with timber planks that smell of pine woods on a summer's afternoon, the Lotus Way houses echo the local beach-hut vernacular. But there the similarity ends. For these homes are custom-built for their exposed location. To make the most of the sunshine, living rooms and bedrooms face south or west, and have large windows; even the gardens are arranged in such a way that they trap the sun. Conversely, rooms with north and east elevations have small windows, and a shelter-belt of trees has been planted to protect these walls from the biting winter winds. </p> <p>Inside, too, the Lotus Way homes could hardly be more different from the cramped bungalows that were simply not built for families. For three years, Avril and George Cutts and their 10-year-old grand- daughter, Chantel, have been crammed into a shoebox property whose biggest bedroom would barely take a double bed and whose atmosphere was clammy with the smell of bottled gas. Now they have light and air, and for the first time, Avril has been able to buy a three-seater sofa knowing that her living room is large enough to accommodate it. </p> <p>Lotus Way is now home to 58 adults and 56 children, and already the street has that feeling of neighbourliness on which Jaywick residents pride themselves. But there is more to regeneration than building a couple of rows of fresh new houses. As Mary Puddick, resident and chair of the Community Forum, says, \"The unfortunate thing about Jaywick is that it needed to be taken into the 21st century step by step by step. But it got left behind.\" </p> <p>One person who is determined to put that situation right - with the residents, rather than simply for them - is Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Quinlivan. Employed by the Guinness Trust to work as a regeneration project manager with the community, she knows the importance of working from the ground up. \"When we started,\" she says, \"nobody would come to public meetings. So instead we talked to people where they were, whether it was on the beach or in the cafe.\" It worked, and before long, she was painfully familiar with Jaywick's many problems. \"For a long time it was considered a thorn in the side of the council. In the 70s, they wanted to flatten the whole place, but the residents went to the High Court and won. Up until then, water had come from standpipes at the end of each street. After the court case, drainage and mains water were put in.\" </p> <p>But the drains, says Quinlivan, were inadequate, and today they need upgrading, along with virtually everything else, including the crumbling streets that are awash with water in the winter, so that anyone with a wheelchair has no choice but to stay indoors. </p> <p>And then there are the social problems. Unemployment is particularly high, and a third of primary-school children have special needs. \"Twelve years ago,\" says Quinlivan, \"there was a lot of infighting going on here, with firebombings and all sorts. But there is nothing like that now. And yet the place still has a terrible reputation in the area. A lot of the people here have opted out of normal society. You can disappear very easily in a place like Jaywick. Some may be running away from ex-partners or the police. And many came from London just to get away from violent communities.\" </p> <p>But, time and again, the people you speak to at Jaywick tell you that this is a special place - that you either love it or hate it, and that they love it. \"I've met more interesting people here than anywhere else I've worked,\" says Quinlivan. </p> <p>Some locals, it seems, are fearful of any change, however, even if their homes are falling down around their ears. \"The idea of Lotus Way was to rehouse people living in the 40 worst properties,\" says Quinlivan, but, when it came to it, nobody from the worst properties came forward.\" </p> <p>So, although there is likely to be a second phase of house-building in the future - a mix, perhaps, of self-build and shared-ownership homes - the Trust, in partnership with the community, local authority and other agencies, is now concentrating on improving the most dilapidated bungalows, getting the infrastructure upgraded and persuading people to take up the various services available to them. </p> <p>Much of Quinlivan's job involves applying for funding from a variety of sources - from the EU to the lottery - while at the same time encouraging residents to take control of their own destinies and, ultimately, even to manage their own neighbourhood. \"We don't want to take over,\" she says. \"I actually think of myself as working for people here rather than for the Guinness Trust.\" </p> <p>She first visited Jaywick Sands as a little girl. \"My aunt had a chalet here 35 years ago,\" she says, \"and I can still remember the beach and the standpipes. So, when this job came up, I jumped at it. </p> <p>\"And then I came down here. It was a February day, cold and grey, and when I saw it I felt embarrassed to have a nice Victorian house in Colchester when there were people living here like this. I knew then that I couldn't just walk away from it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A funny thing happens as you drive down the road to Jaywick. The bungalows get smaller and smaller. It's as if something strange has occurred out here where the Essex marshes meet the grey North Sea. And, in a way, that's right. Look around. Have you strayed into one of those model villages that were once all the rage in our seaside resorts? Did some barmy farmer build himself a private Lilliput, then abandon it to the north-east wind? You're getting warmer. See here. Some of them look no bigger than beach huts, yet these little wood-framed houses are occupied. Cars park higgledy-piggledy beside cracked-up concrete alleys. Children make their way home from the local primary school. Laughter erupts from the Dolphin Diner. These miniature streets, with the beach at one end and cows grazing at the other, are for real. But why are so many of the tiny homes coming apart, like Wendy houses left to decay in a corner of the garden? Why are the streets so broken and ill-lit at night? And why, here's a question for you, why are so many of them named after cars? Here are Talbot, Wolseley, Sunbeam and Hillman, Austin, Alvis, Humber and Vauxhall. There's a Singer and a Riley, a Napier and a Lincoln. There's even a Rover somewhere (but not a BMW in sight).

      "body": "<p>An utterly gob-smackingly gorgeous bubbly to celebrate the end of the school holidays next month? Track down the 1995 vintage of Pelorus, from the Cloudy Bay bunch in New Zealand. A massive advance on the 1994, this is one of the most richly elegant sparkling wines on the planet. The pastry-edged fruit is outstanding, and has to be compared with absurdities such as Krug which cost five or six times as much. It rates 18 points, out of 20, and Unwins do it cheapest (\u00a312.49). It's also at Majestic, Tesco, Wine Rack and Bottoms Up, and Sainsbury (where it costs \u00a314.99). There is a non-vintage blend of Pelorus, which is no mean performer, either, rating 17 points and costing \u00a312.99, and it's at Wine Rack, Bottoms Up and Wine Cellar. </p> <p>This latter is a small retailer, with just 70 branches nationwide, but its heroic buyer, David Vaughan, has some terrific southern French wines at tasty prices. Shiraz Foncalieu 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.99) is dry yet rich, fruity yet not juicy and puerile, striking yet elegant, ripe yet not OTT. A good glugging wine and casserole candidate. Domaine du Bosquet Merlot Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.49) has superb dry fruit, which coats the tastebuds with cassis, leather, earthy herbs and great tannins. Domaine Coste Blanque Montpeyroux Ch\u00e2teaux du Languedoc 1998 (17 points, \u00a35.99) mounts a massively mouth-filling opening attack of fruit, with tannins and acids in perfect, overwhelming harmony, and then settles down to show its subtle side - a terrific, energetic wine of weight yet wit. Domaine de Villemajou Corbi\u00e8res 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.99) has wild cherries and strawberries, blackcurrants, herbs and a hint of old stable door - a terrifically generous mouthful. Ch\u00e2teau l'Ermitage Blanc Costi\u00e8res de Nmes 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.79) offers crackingly good peach/apricot/lemon fruit, very subtle, beautifully textured. It's a confident, very classy wine. Ch\u00e2teau l'Ermitage Ros\u00e9 Costi\u00e8res de Nmes 1998 (15.5 points, \u00a34.79) is a superbly dry ros\u00e9 of warmth and richness. Really effective as a quaffer and a barbecue wine. Also at Wine Cellar is Matua Valley Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from New Zealand. This is a rich, not classically dry sauvignon, but none the worse for that, as it is deftly textured, layered and polished and has a good, firm finish. Jordan Chardonnay 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a39.99), from South Africa, shows melon and lime yoghurt with a hint of walnut; an individual approach to the chardonnay riddle and an original solution. It is also at Unwins and, it is rumoured, Waitrose. </p> <p>Pinot noir and Romania are also rich in rumour. Some readers may remember the late 80s, when Sainsbury's boasted an astonishing Romanian pinot noir for around two quid, which subsequently vanished without trace. Tesco has Reka Valley, but this non-vintage pinot has never hugely appealed - until recently. Tesco's Reka Valley Romanian Pinot Noir (15.5 points, \u00a32.99) in the new blend has bitter cherry richness, a hint of ripe plum, but the winning ingredient is the brilliant tannic edge. Classic pinot? No, but a brilliant bargain of wrap-around-your-palate fruit and great chilled. I must also mention Tesco's Marques de Chive Tempranillo (15 points, \u00a33.49), where the tannins also star and give the coconut-edged fruit some real backbone. </p> <p>Thresher &amp; Victoria Wine have an outstanding red: Amarone della Valpolicella Via Nova 1997 (18 points, \u00a39.99), which exhibits classic overtones of licorice, fig, raspberry, blackcurrant, herbs, jam, tannins and rich acids. The texture is bracing, balsamic, and distinctively lingering. Yet, withal, this is not, in spite of 14.5% alcohol, a bruising experience. Having tasted it in Verona, Sicily and the King's Road, I can testify to its ability to travel deliciously well. </p> <p>And last, three summer bargains at the Co-Op on offer until August 20: Portada Tinto 1998 (14 points), from Portugal, is fresh, juicy and costs \u00a32.99; Trulli Primitivo Salento 1998 (14.5 points), from Italy, has ripe plums and peaches, a hint of cherry and wild strawberry, and costs \u00a33.49; and Elephant Trail Colombard &amp; Chardonnay 2000 (14 points), from South Africa, is a touch blatant, but this is surely forgiveable at \u00a32.79.</p>",

And last, three summer bargains at the Co-Op on offer until August 20: Portada Tinto 1998 (14 points), from Portugal, is fresh, juicy and costs \u00a32.99; Trulli Primitivo Salento 1998 (14.5 points), from Italy, has ripe plums and peaches, a hint of cherry and wild strawberry, and costs \u00a33.49; and Elephant Trail Colombard &amp; Chardonnay 2000 (14 points), from South Africa, is a touch blatant, but this is surely forgiveable at \u00a32.79.",

Yet, of all the ices, they are by far the easiest to make, requiring no higher technology than a freezer, a suitable tray in which to freeze them and a fork.</p> <p>It may well be that this very simplicity has worked against them. One can easily imagine the shrieks of horror from culinary platforms at the very idea of food that can be made without sweat and tears, at something as absurdly simple as a cordial or syrup flavoured with a fruit or an essence that is then placed in a freezer and left to turn crystalline. However, the case for the defence is as simple and elegant as the recipe for the accused: the ingredients must be of the highest calibre - the strawberries or raspberries, say, must be suitably ripened under the sun with ne'er a trace of green or blemish; the coffee must be a superior espresso; the wine must be of very sound quality; and so on and so on.</p> <p>But the result - the delicate crunch of the crystals between the teeth, the sensation of those same crystals dissolving back to the liquid from which they were formed, releasing the essence of fruit, claret or coffee (you can make granitas out of just about anything) - is as sensuous, refreshing and pleasing as anything produced by its close cousins. And because granitas contain less sugar than ice cream or sorbets, you could say that they are better for you.</p> <p>Appealing to look at, delicious to eat and refreshing, too, granitas are the epitome of stylish, economic, great eating, as anyone who has sat in the Piazza del Popolo in Rome with a thick, glass dish filled to the brim with the dark brown slush of a granita di caffe, capped with a froth of whipped cream, will tell you. And Rome is as good a place as any to eat a piece of history, for granitas must be closest to the original sherbets (the habit of cooling drinks with handfuls of snow or ice) of Turkey and Arabia from which all ices sprang.</p> <p>These days it may be virtually impossible to imagine a time when refrigeration was not a simple fact of everyday life, and when an ice-cream machine was the great indulgence and sole preserve of the devoted gourmet. That now being the case, it is easy to see why a granita would not thrill a public as it must have done in the days when ice came into the cities by cart or barge. The satisfaction of making a gorgeous, creamy custard, rich with egg yolk and cream, and flavoured with a fruit or essence, is immense and the result sublime. However, there is a knack to making ice cream, and it must be eaten swiftly, as it diminishes in quality the older and firmer it becomes. Granita, on the other hand, keeps very well indeed for several days in a sealed container in the freezer.</p> <p>The passion for granita waned outside Italy with the rise in popularity of ice cream; fair enough, I suppose. But does it then not appear strange that the Italians still love granita and ice cream and sorbet, whereas we seem to have the capacity to handle only one at a time. This oversight is even more extraordinary given the great reign of terror of food scares that we are currently living through, as granitas are both light and healthy, and haven't even a trace of dairy or any ingredient that kills on sight.</p> <p>So, the next time that tub of sorbet falls into your shopping basket at the supermarket, pause for a moment, think \"granita\", and then go and have another look at the fruit section or the coffees or the wine department. Nothing could be easier. Promise.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Lemon granita</b><br> It is worth noting that sugar cubes can be used here, so that they can first be rubbed over the skin of the lemon, thereby absorbing the oils and intense flavour therein. In fact, this was once standard practice, and a pleasing job for those with the time and inclination to make a most simple but marvellously flavoured ice.</p> <p><b> 6-7 untreated lemons <br> 1 litre water <br> 250ml caster sugar</b></p> <p>If the prospect of applying a sugar cube to the lemon zest bores you, then simply grate the zest from the lemons, taking care not to scrape off even the merest hint of pith. Halve the zested lemons, squeeze out the juice and strain it. Put the sugar, water and lemon zest into a pot, and place it over a medium heat. Cook, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved completely, taking care that the mixture does not come to the boil, or the flavour may turn bitter. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool.</p> <p>Once the syrup has completely cooled down, pour in the lemon juice, stir to combine, then tip into a deep-sided dish and place in the freezer. After half-an-hour or so, break up any ice that has formed with the tines of a fork - the crystals will form first on the outside, so scrape them into the more slushy matter in middle of the dish. Repeat every half-hour or so, until the whole dish consists of lemon-spiked ice crystals. Cream need not appear on this granita, though its presence is very pleasant.</p> <p><b> Coffee granita</b><br> In saying that there is no machinery involved in making granita, a very good espresso machine would be most helpful in making the coffee for this one. At Bibendum, we used to pour a small spoonful of intense coffee syrup over the cream.</p> <p>For the granita</p> <p><b> 1 litre very good, strong, black coffee (preferably espresso) <br> 4 tbsp caster sugar</b></p> <p>For the syrup</p> <p><b> 75g ground coffee <br> 50g caster sugar <br> 300ml water</b></p> <p>To finish</p> <p><b> 150ml double cream</b></p> <p>Dissolve the sugar completely in the coffee, and pour it into a deep-sided dish to cool. Once cold, place the dish in the freezer. After-half-an hour, take a fork and give the coffee a stir to break up the clumps of crystals, and repeat every half-hour or so until the granita is made. Cover, and leave in the freezer until ready to serve.</p> <p>Now make the syrup. Put the sugar, coffee and water in a saucepan and place over a medium heat. Bring the pot to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, until the liquid is syrupy. Pour through a very fine sieve and leave to cool. (This syrup keeps very well in the fridge, and goes very well over a decent vanilla ice cream, incidentally.)</p> <p>Whip the cream until soft peaks have formed. Spoon the granita into a pretty glass, lay a spoonful of cream on top, and trickle over a teaspoonful of syrup.</p> <p><b> Strawberry granita</b><br> This is delicious and very pretty, but only if the strawberries are very good. Raspberries work very well, too, though they may require a little additional sugar.</p> <p><b> 1.2kg strawberries <br> lemon, juiced <br> orange, juiced <br> 225g caster sugar <br> 140ml water</b></p> <p>Hull the strawberries, pop them into the blender and whizz to a liquid. Pass through a fine sieve and set aside. In a small pan, dissolve the sugar in the water over a medium heat and bring just to the boil. Simmer for five minutes, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool right down. Once cooled, add the syrup to the strawberry mixture, along with the orange and lemon juices, and stir to combine. Pour into a deep-sided dish, place in the freezer and proceed as in the preceding recipes. Cream really is not required here - I mean it this time - and the addition of a sprig of mint is absolutely forbidden.</p> <p><b> Elderflower granita with gooseberry fool </b><br> A fabulous combination, and a charming use for all that cordial made in the short, swift elderflower season.</p> <p><b> 500ml elderflower cordial <br> 500ml water</b></p> <p>For the fool</p> <p><b> 500g gooseberries <br> 125g caster sugar <br> 140ml thick double cream</b></p> <p>Mix the cordial with the water, pour it into a deep-sided dish and place it in the freezer. Make the granita in the usual manner. Put the sugar into a pot with the gooseberries, and cook very gently until the fruit has softened. Push the gooseberry mixture though a sieve and set aside to cool. Lightly whip the cream, and stir into the gooseberry pur\u00e9e.</p> <p>To serve, put some granita into six pretty glasses and top with a generous spoonful of fool. (Keep the rest of the fool to eat with thin almond biscuits)</p> <p><b> Technical tips</b></p> <p>\u0095 Granitas are low-tech ices made from fruit juices, cordials or other liquids, sugar, lemon and water. You can't make granita in an ice-cream machine. The only equipment you need is: one shallow plastic freezer-proof container; one fork; one freezer.</p> <p>\u0095 They are supposed to be coarse, grainy ice crystals. You can't make a granita straight from the juice of a pectin-rich berry or pulpy fruit, as the crystals will be too small. You must add water to them to get the larger crystal effect.</p> <p>\u0095 You use less sugar than you would in other ices. The more sugar, the finer the crystal. You can't make granitas with a lot of sugar (9-10 degrees Baume for the technically minded), because you would lose the classic grainy texture, the mixture would go all sticky and smooth, and it would cease to be a granita and become a water ice instead.</p> <p>\u0095 Freeze the mixture for one hour in the plastic container. Stir the crystals that form around the edge of the container with a fork. Repeat the process every 30 minutes or so, until all the liquid has turned to soft, grainy crystals - this can take up to 2 hours.</p> <p>\u0095 If the mixture freezes solid, you can break it up in the food processor, but the crystals will be too fine for the true granita effect.</p> <p>\u0095 According to the irreplaceable Ice - The Definitive Guide, by Caroline Liddell and Robin Weir, 'To achieve the perfect granita, there is no substitute for the fork technique'.</p> <p>\u0095 Granita is at its best when eaten the moment it is ready. However, it will keep quite happily for several days in the freezer, if needed, although it will solidify considerably. In this eventuality, take it out of the freezer about an hour before you want to eat it, leave to defrost slightly, then beat again with a fork, and pop back in the freezer until needed.</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is the chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.</p>",

If you are a sick person waiting for an operation, an old person waiting for a decent pension rise or an unemployed person hoping for a little dignity - you're joking, aren't you? If, however, you are a psychopathic Irish murderer of either denomination, General Pinochet or a paedophile with an average of 300 offences against children by the time you're finally caught (as the average paedophile does), you can expect to be chucked under the chin and sent along home with an ominous, \"And don't do it again!\" Watching the Maze murderers trot off to get their \"compensation\", never has that old Private Eye line about misplaced clemency rung truer: MURDER NOW AND WIN A FORD FIESTA! </p> <p>Why do governments, establishments and judicial systems of every complexion do all they can to let nasty people get away with things - be they the IMF or a kinky headmaster - while pouring contempt on the meek, the poor and the law-abiding? I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I've come to the conclusion that civilised \"soft\" men - that is, men who push pens, make laws and wear white collars for a living - in a horrible primeval part of their minds, still believe that they should be uncivilised \"hard\" men; men who go around causing havoc, hurt and mayhem wherever they can. They obviously can't chuck it all in and run off to enact a career of evil themselves, but when they are called upon by the people to deal with such types, their innate sympathy and self-loathing show through in the way that they do not come down on them with the full force of the law but rather bend over backwards to excuse any old wife murderer, child molester, mad bomber or Fascist dictator. Forge a banknote or sell some drugs, however, and they'll clap you away for life; your crimes weren't \"manly\" enough, you see. </p> <p>Of course, I don't go along with mad old Mugabe in believing that this Government is made up exclusively of effeminate homosexuals, but you must admit that it has a higher proportion of Softies than any in recent memory - even our rampantly heterosexual leader always took the female parts in school plays, and was known by jealous classmates at various points in his education as both \"Emily\" and \"Miranda\". And as we know from the work of artists as varied as Genet, Pasolini and Isherwood, there's nothing like being a Softie oneself to make one admire the thug, the brute and the bully. This sad syndrome is currently a great force in popular culture, as well as in politics. The sorry spectacle of public schoolboys making films about how well-dressed, witty and cool working-class sociopaths are continues with the forthcoming Snatch, the latest film by Guy Ritchie, whose mother is a Lady, whose sister is a Tabitha, and who obviously got that impressive-looking scar by falling off his pony and landing on his silver spoon. </p> <p>In the recent controversy over the naming of paedophiles, it was interesting to see how the Government and its most virulent critics on both left and right combined to speak as one logical, male, middle-class voice to quell the fears (and, covertly, mock the efforts) of a supposedly illogical, mostly female, massively working-class mob. Suddenly, people who have shown nothing but contempt for and mistrust of the police were lecturing the News Of The World and its readers to \"let the police and professionals deal with it\". Is this the same \"inherently racist\" police force that \"bungled\" the Stephen Lawrence case, or is it another lot? </p> <p>The fact is that the contempt shown to anxious parents is part and parcel of the contempt shown to the working class of this country over the past 20 years. For, make no mistake, it is working-class children who are the victims of abduction, assault by strangers and murder; the rest live their lives in a cradle-to-rave bubble of play-dates and people-movers. The lonely death of a raped child in England is in no way less \"political\" than that of an African child by starvation; both are about the triumph of brute force over beauty and innocence. A sensible socialist should have no more scruples about watching the execution of a child murderer than she should have about watching the execution of the heads of the world banks. Not only have the working classes been stripped of their rights at work and in unemployment, they are not even allowed to be fully informed in order to protect their one precious thing - their children - to the best of their abilities. </p> <p> We are told by liberals in law, media and government that we mustn't back any laws that might make paedophiles \"more\" dangerous; we must, it seems, speak soothingly to them, not make any sudden moves and wind them three times a day after meals. But no one ever seems to care about making decent, law-abiding people meaner and nastier, which successive governments' failure to punish evil adequately certainly has done. Seeing how this Government seems tirelessly determined to punish virtue and reward violence has, I'm afraid, turned even me from a rather docile and squeamish individual into a full-on red-mist mentalist, not a day now goes by when I do not imagine what it would feel like physically to injure a member of the current regime. </p> <p>For instance, I cannot see murderers swagger from the Maze, their victims' bodies still lost and unburied, without wanting to shut Peter Mandelson's treacherous hand, which signed the documents that freed them, in a car door, or hear about British bankrolling of yet another bunch of filthy foreign gangsters without feeling a compulsion to put Robin Cook's beard in a mangle and turn it until his eyes pop. On hearing that Lord Irvine had spent \u00a31,528 of public money on two heated towel rails in the same week as the majestic 15p rise for pensioners was announced, I had a brief but pleasing fantasy of tying him, naked, to those same towel rails - one at the front, one at the back - and leaving him like that until his skin came off in strips. And who, on hearing Paul Boateng's quite repulsively posh and priggish voice assuring us that working-class parents have absolutely no need to be informed of active paedophiles in their communities, can honestly say that it would be much of a loss if one day soon he was left to rot in a muddy field somewhere? </p> <p>See what I mean? It's bad, innit? But it's not my fault that society made me like this. Don't make me any angrier, I'm warning you, or I might go underground. At least while I'm writing here, you can keep an eye on me.</p>",

David Wishart Birmingham I was annoyed to read Delia Ephron's pretentious and banal piece The Great Escape? (July 29). Ms Ephron is a minor member in New York of what you in Britain would refer to as the 'chattering classes'. Moreover, to refer to East Hampton, New York, as 'rural' would be like referring to Windsor Castle as 'rural', or Ibiza as a quaint Mediterranean beach resort. The fact is that East Hampton, once a rural, potato-growing artist colony, has long since expired and morphed into an exclusive celebrity watering hole - a Groucho Club by the sea, if you like. Fred Weiss New York Malcolm Gluck refers to my letter in the daily paper regarding cork taint (Superplonk, July 29). Has he forgotten his earlier article in which he referred to research when 91 wine 'experts' were invited to a blind tasting in which a sound wine was divided into five - four parts of which were given common faults, including cork taint. Only 11% detected the taint, 14% the untainted wine. Monkeys pressing buttons at random would have got 50%. Bob Lindo Camel Valley Vineyard Bodmin, Cornwall For Julie Burchill to say that she used to march against the NF and then to state an opinion that she thinks countries of the developing world are 'like a ditzy wife' who 'after all clamoured for independence' is simply a hypocritical, vapid, offensive nonsense. Burchill fails to realise that these countries clamoured for independence from the cruel husband of empire, who bankrupted them, beat them down and caused wars with their divide-and-rule systems that are still being fought today.

      "body": "<p>August of our first summer in France was spent in La Teste sur Mer, a tiny oyster village on the Bassin d'Arcachon in the Gironde. We stayed with my aunt, Tante Jeanne, and my uncle, Oncle Gustav, in the same white stuccoed house where my father had summered as a boy. Tante Jeanne was a frumpy, bespectacled, slightly smelly old woman; Oncle Gustav, a geezer in coveralls and beret who smoked hand-rolled cigarettes until they disappeared on to the tip of his tongue. Little had changed about La Teste in the years since my father had vacationed there. The neighbours were still all oyster fishermen. Their families still raised rabbits and grew tomatoes in their backyards. Houses had two kitchens, an inside one and an outdoor \"fish kitchen\". There was a hand pump for drinking water from a well, and an outhouse by the rear of the garden. </p> <p>My brother and I were reasonably happy here. The beaches were warm, there were lizards to hunt down and exterminate with readily available p\u00e9tards, firecrackers, which one could buy legally (!) over-the-counter. There was a forest within walking distance where an actual hermit lived, and my brother and I spent hours there, spying on him from the underbrush. By now I could read comic books in French and, of course, I was eating - really eating. Murky brown soupe de poisson, tomato salad, moules marini\u00e8res, poulet basquaise (we were only a few miles from the Basque country). We made day trips to Cap Ferret, a wild, deserted and breathtakingly magnificent Atlantic beach with big rolling waves, taking along baguettes and saucissons and wheels of cheese, wine and Evian (bottled water was at that time unheard of back home). A few miles west was Lac Cazeaux, a fresh-water lake where my brother and I could rent p\u00e9dalo watercraft. We ate gaufres, delicious hot waffles, covered in whipped cream and powdered sugar. The two hot songs of that summer on the Cazeaux jukebox were Whiter Shade Of Pale by Procol Harum and These Boots Were Made For Walkin' by Nancy Sinatra. The French played those two songs over and over again, the music punctuated by the sonic booms from French air force jets that would swoop over the lake on their way to a nearby bombing range. </p> <p>When our neighbour, Monsieur Saint-Jour, the oyster fisherman, invited my family out on his penas (oyster boat), I was enthusiastic. </p> <p>At six in the morning, we boarded Monsieur Saint-Jour's small wooden vessel with our picnic baskets and our sensible footwear. He was a crusty old bastard, dressed like my uncle in ancient denim coveralls, espadrilles and beret. He had a leathery, tanned and windblown face, hollow cheeks, and the tiny broken blood vessels on his nose and cheeks that everyone seemed to have from drinking so much of the local Bordeaux. We put-putted out to a buoy marking his underwater oyster parc, a fenced-off section of the bay bottom, and we sat . . . and sat . . . and sat, in the roaring August sun, waiting for the tide to go out. The idea was to float the boat over the stockaded fence walls, then sit there as the boat slowly sank with the water level, until it rested on the basin floor. At this point, Monsieur Saint-Jour would rake the oysters, collect a few good specimens for sale in port, and remove any parasites that might be endangering his crop. </p> <p>There was, I recall, still about two feet of water left to go before the hull of the boat settled on dry ground and we could walk about the parc. We'd already polished off the Brie and baguettes, but I was still hungry, and characteristically said so. </p> <p>Monsieur Saint-Jour, on hearing this - as if challenging his American passengers - inquired in his thick Girondais accent if any of us would care to try an oyster. </p> <p>My parents hesitated. I doubt they'd realised they might have actually to eat one of the raw, slimy things we were currently floating over. My little brother recoiled in horror. </p> <p>But I, in the proudest moment of my young life, stood up smartly, grinning with defiance, and volunteered to be the first. </p> <p>And in that unforgettably sweet moment, that one moment still more alive for me than so many of the other \"firsts\" that followed - first sex, first joint, first day in high school, first published book - I attained glory. Monsieur Saint-Jour beckoned me over to the gunwale, where he leaned over, reached down until his head nearly disappeared underwater, and emerged holding a single silt-encrusted oyster, huge and irregularly shaped, in his rough, clawlike fist. With a snubby, rust-covered oyster knife, he popped the thing open and handed it to me, everyone watching now, my little brother shrinking away from this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive. </p> <p>I took it in my hand, tilted the shell back into my mouth as instructed by the by now beaming Monsieur Saint-Jour, and with one bite and a slurp wolfed it down. It tasted of seawater . . . of brine and flesh . . . and, somehow . . . of the future. </p> <p>Everything was different now. Everything. </p> <p>I'd not only survived - I'd enjoyed . </p> <p>This, I knew, was the magic I had until now been only dimly and spitefully aware of. I was hooked. My parents' shudders, my little brother's expression of unrestrained revulsion and amazement only reinforced the sense that I had, somehow, become a man. I had had an adventure , tasted forbidden fruit, and everything that followed in my life - the food, the long and often stupid and self-destructive chase for the next thing , whether it was drugs or sex or some other new sensation - would all stem from this moment. </p> <p>I'd learned something. Viscerally, instinctively, spiritually - even in some small, precursive way, sexually - and there was no turning back. The genie was out of the bottle. My life as a cook, and as a chef, had begun. </p> <p>In 1981, my good friend from high school, Sam G, became the chef de cuisine of Work Progress. A once-trendy restaurant on Spring Street in SoHo, the place had fallen on hard times. It was now under new ownership and Sammy - one of us ! - was in charge of putting the kitchen together. It was what a lot of us had been waiting for, our own thing, and the call went out to all our old cronies. From Provincetown, Cape Cod, where I'd had my first job as a dishwasher, came Dimitri, enticed by excited promises of culinary history in the making. From West Village saloons, we recruited every young, pot-smoking, head-banging hooligan we'd ever worked with, filling their heads with dreams of glory. \"We're forming . . . like . . . a rock-and-roll band, man, an all-star group of culinary superstars . . . kinda like Blind Faith. We're going to tear a new asshole into the New York restaurant scene.\" </p> <p>We fancied ourselves the most know-ledgeable and experienced young Turks in town, and our hearts were filled with hope and the promise of enviable futures. We thought we were the only cooks in New York who could quote from the Larousse Gastronomique and R\u00e9pertoire de la Cuisine, who knew who Vatel, Car me and Escoffier were, what Bocuse, Verg\u00e9 and Gu\u00e9rard were doing across the water, and we were determined to replicate their successes and their fame. There was no one on the horizon we could see who could touch us. </p> <p>The new owners of Work Progress, our putative masters, were a textbook example of People Who Should Never Own A Restaurant. There were two brothers - one half-smart, the other genuinely dumb - who'd gotten a few bucks from Mommy and Daddy, along with their partner, a slightly more cognizant college friend who could actually read a P and L sheet and crunch a few numbers. Their principal business was investing in off-Broadway shows. As this, apparently, wasn't unprofitable enough, they'd chosen the restaurant business as a way to lose their money more quickly and assuredly. </p> <p>From the get-go, Sammy, Dimitri and I managed to intimidate the partners right out of their own restaurant. At every suggestion from this novice triumvirate, we'd snort with contempt, roll our eyes with world-weary derision and shoot down whatever outrage - be it tablecloths, flatware or menu items - they'd come up with. </p> <p>We fought all the time, Sam, Dimitri and I. Waving our cookbooks at each other, we'd squabble endlessly over the \"correct\" way to prepare certain dishes. We teased, poked, prodded, sulked, conspired and competed. We wanted to be the best, we wanted to be different but, at the same time, correct. We came up with the looniest, most ambitious menu our endorphin-overloaded brains could agree on, a sort of Greatest Hits Of Our Checkered Careers So Far collection. French classics sat side-by-side with Portuguese squid stew, my Tante Jeanne's humble salade de tomates, dishes we'd lifted out of cookbooks, stolen from other chefs, remembered seeing on TV. There were Wellfleet oysters on the halfshell, there was a pasta dish from Mario's - a sort of taglierini with trail-mix and anchovies, as I recall - scallops in sorrel sauce (from Bocuse, maybe?), calves' liver with raspberry-vinegar sauce, swordfish with black beans and white rice, pompano en papillotte, my mom's cr\u00e8me renvers\u00e9e . . . </p> <p>We were high all the time, sneaking off to the walk-in at every opportunity to \"conceptualise\". Hardly a decision was made without drugs. We worked long hours and took considerable pride in our efforts - the drugs, we thought, having little effect on the end-product. That was what the life we were in was about, we believed. We might be tripping out on blotter acid, sleepless for three days and halfway through a bottle of Stoli, but we were professionals , goddammit! We didn't let it affect our line work. And we were happy, truly happy, like Henry V's lucky few, a band of brothers, ragged, slightly debauched warriors, who anticipated nothing less than total victory - an Agincourt of the mind and stomach. </p> <p>We were pretty busy initially and, along with the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who held us in something like awe, Sam, Dimitri and I would work all day and late into the night. When the restaurant closed, we'd take over the bar, drinking Cristal - which we'd buy at cost - and running fat rails of coke from one end of the bar to the other, then crawling along on all-fours to snort them. The cuter and more degenerate members of the floor staff would hang with us, so there was a lot of humping in the dry-goods area and on the banquettes, 50-pound flour sacks being popular staging areas for after-work copulation. A squadron of punk rocker junkie guitar heroes ate for free at Work Progress - so we got free tickets and backstage passes to the Mudd Club, CBGB, Tier Three, Hurrah, Club 57 and so on. And when the clubs closed it was off to after-hours, where we'd drink and do more drugs until, weather permitting, we'd hit the seven o'clock train to Long Beach. We'd finish the last of our smack on the train, then pass out on the beach. Whichever one of us woke from the nod would roll the others over to avoid an uneven burn. When we finally arrived back at work, sand in our hair, we looked tanned, rested and ready. </p> <p>We considered ourselves a tribe. As such, we had a number of unusual customs and rituals all our own. If you cut yourself in the Work Progress kitchen, tradition called for maximum spillage and dispersion of blood. One squeezed the wound till it ran freely, then hurled great gouts of red spray on the jackets and aprons of comrades. We loved blood in our kitchen. If you dinged yourself badly, it was no disgrace; we'd stencil a little cut-out shape of a chef knife under your station to commemorate the event. After a while, you'd have a little row of these things, like a fighter pilot. The house cat - a mouse-killer - got her own stencil (a tiny mouse shape) sprayed on the wall by her water bowl, signifying confirmed kills. </p> <p>We cared little for managers or owners - or customers, for that matter. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, our restaurant was rapidly failing. I began to see, for the first time, what I would later recognise as Failing Restaurant Syndrome, an affliction that causes owners to flail about looking for a quick fix, a masterstroke that will \"turn things around\", reverse the already irreversible trend toward insolvency. We tried New Orleans Brunch - complete with Dixieland band. We tried a prix fixe menu, a Sunday night buffet, we advertised and we hired a publicist. Each successive brainstorm was more counterproductive than the one before. </p> <p>When the paychecks started bouncing, and the vendors started to put us on COD (cash on delivery), the owners called in the restaurant consultants. Even then, we knew what that meant: the consultants usually arrive just ahead of the repo men and the marshals. It was the death knell. We had tried. We had failed. Naturally, we held the owners responsible. It was a tough spot, the ambiance was no good, the music in the dining room sucked, the waiters weren't well trained . . . But the truth was, we just weren't good enough. Our food, while charming to some, was unappealing to most. We did not commit seppuku. Sam and Dimitri stayed on, determined to go down with the ship. </p> <p>But my cousin had hooked me up with my very first chef job, at a spanking-new but already troubled bote in the theatre district, and I jumped at the offer. I felt bad about leaving my friends behind. And I had the beginnings of a very nasty little heroin habit from all the dope I'd been sniffing - but hey! I was about to become a chef! </p> <p>It is one of the central ironies of my career that as soon as I got off heroin, things started getting really bad. High on dope, I was at least a chef, well paid, much liked by crew and floor and owners alike. Stabilised on methadone, I became nearly unemployable by polite society: a shiftless, untrustworthy coke-sniffer, sneak thief and corner-cutting hack, toiling in the culinary backwaters. </p> <p>I worked a seedy hotel on upper Madison, a place so slow that the one waiter would have to come downstairs and wake me when customers came in. I worked a lunch counter on Amsterdam, flipping pancakes and doing short-order eggs for politicos and their bagmen. I worked a bizarre combination art gallery/bistro on Columbus, just me and a coke-dealing bartender - a typically convenient and destructive symbiotic arrangement. I was a sous chef at a very fine two-star place on 39th, where I dimly recall preparing a four-course meal for Paul Bocuse; he thanked me in French, I think. I worked a deserted crab house on Second Avenue. I cooked brunches in SoHo, I slopped out steam-table chow at a bar on 8th Street to a bunch of drunks. </p> <p>For a time, I took another chef's job - of sorts - at a moment of need at Billy's, a combo sit-down/take-out upscale chicken joint on Bleecker Street. It was an operation that was to be the flagship of another planned empire, a chain of chicken joints that would stretch across the globe. </p> <p>At this low point in my career, I didn't care if the place succeeded or not. I needed the money. </p> <p>My boss was an older Jewish guy, fresh out of prison, who'd named the place after his youngest son, Billy, a feckless ne'er-do-well. He had been, in an earlier life, the head of the counting room at a Las Vegas casino and, after being caught skimming off millions for the \"boys back in New York and Cincinnati\", had been offered a friendly deal should he co-operate with the prosecutors. He had, admirably, declined, and as a result spent the last five years eating prison chow. When he got out, a near-broken man, his old buddies in New York, being Men of Honour, set him up with this restaurant as a sign of gratitude for services rendered. </p> <p>Unfortunately, while in prison, the old man had completely lost his mind. He may have been a stand-up guy, but he was absolutely barking mad. </p> <p>This was not a classic bust-out operation, where the mob deliberately runs a place into the ground, using a front man/straw owner to run up bills, then pillage the place for merchandise and credit. I think that the wise guys really wanted the poor slob to make money and be a success. They made earnest efforts to help at every turn, enduring much nonsense from their visibly deranged partner. </p> <p>I'd seen mobsters around before, of course, but I'd never worked in a place that was out-and-out mobbed up, where I came to know on a personal basis real wise guys, whose names I recognised from the papers. Everyone was astonishingly up-front about their connections. My boss was fond of yelling into the phone when discussing prices with a purveyor, \"You know who I am? You know who I'm with ?!\" </p> <p>We did things differently at Billy's. </p> <p>My cooks, for one: every one of them came from the Fortune Society, guys who spent their off-hours in halfway houses, allowed out only to work. I was used to working with a fairly rough bunch, a lot of whom, at one time or another, had had problems with the law - but at Billy's every single one of my cooks was still basically a convict. I can't say that it was an unhappy arrangement, either; for once, I knew my cooks were going to show up at work every day - if they didn't, they went back to prison. </p> <p>And credit was easily obtained. I knew, from previous experience, how difficult it is to set up terms for a new restaurant; even getting a week's credit with some of these companies was usually a lengthy process, involving credit applications, a long wait, initial periods of cash on delivery. At Billy's, no sooner was I off the phone than the stuff was arriving, often on 60-day terms. </p> <p>My boss spent a lot of time on the phone, investigating the serious business of horses and their bloodlines, and how well they ran in mud or on grass. Billy himself, at 18, was happy to drive his sports car around and chase girls. So my day-to-day was spent mostly with some genial gentlemen from an Italian Fraternal Organisation. They helpfully told me where to buy my meat and poultry, and how to meet the folks who would be supplying my linen, bread, paper goods and so on. I had a lot of meetings in cars. </p> <p>\"The bread guy is here,\" I'd be told, and a late-model Buick would pull up out front. An old guy in a mashed-down golf cap would beckon me from the driver's seat and then get out of the car. The older guy in the passenger seat would slide over, indicating he wanted me to get in, sit next to him and talk. We'd sit there in the idling car, talking cryptically about bread, before he brought me around to the trunk to examine some product. It was a strange business. </p> <p>My boss got wackier and wackier. When we finally opened, we were packed from the first minute. Orders flooded in over the phone and at the counter and at the tables. We were unprepared and understaffed, so the Italian contingent - including various visiting dignitaries, all with oddly anglicised names (\"This is Mr Dee, Tony, and meet a friend, Mr Brown . . . This is Mr Lang\"), all of them overweight, cigar-chomping, middle-aged guys with bodyguards and 10,000-dollar watches - pitched in to help out. Guys I'd read about later in the papers as running construction in the outer boroughs, purported killers, made men, who lived in concrete piles on Staten Island and Long Beach and security-fenced estates in Jersey, carried brown paper bags of chicken sandwiches up three flights of stairs to Greenwich Village walk-up apartments to make deliveries; they slathered mayo and avocado slices on pitta bread behind the counter, and bussed tables in the dining room. I have to say I liked them for that. </p> <p>But when my boss, inexplicably, showed up one day and told me to fire everyone with a tattoo on my staff, I was faced with a dilemma. Every one of my cooks was festooned with prison tats: screaming skulls, Jesus on hypodermic crosses, bound in barbed wire, gang tats, flaming dice, swastikas, SS flashes, Born to Lose, Born Dead, Love Hate, Mom, portraits of the Madonna, wives, girlfriends, Ozzy Osbourne. I tried to put him off, explaining that we couldn't do without these guys, that the hardest-working, most indispensable guy we had - the guy who right now was loading trash cans with hundreds of marinating chicken parts in the cramped, stifling unrefrigerated cellar on his 22nd consecutive double shift - he was a goddamn Sistine Chapel of skin art. And where am I going to find a convict without a tattoo? The Watergate burglars weren't, to my knowledge, available. </p> <p>Things only got worse. He came in the next day, obsessing about gold chains and jewellery. My grill man had the usual ghetto adornments of the day. \"Where do you think that eggplant [aubergine] got all that gold?\" he raved, spraying food and saliva as he talked. \"Selling drugs. That shit is poison ! Mugging old ladies! I don't want that in my restaurant! Get him out!\" This was clearly impossible, and I sought counsel with one of the silent partners who, as my boss had become increasingly unpredictable, had grown noticeably less silent. \"You hear what he wants me to do?\" I asked. The man just nodded and rolled his eyes, sympathetically, I thought. </p> <p>\"Do nothing,\" he said, and then, with truly dangerous intonation, added, \"Aspetta,\" meaning \"Wait\" in Italian. </p> <p>I didn't like the sound of that. He smiled at me, and I couldn't help picturing my boss, slumped over a dashboard after one of those meetings in a car they were all so fond of. When things came to a head a few days later, my boss openly screaming in the middle of a crowded dining room that he wanted all the tattooed guys and gold chain-wearers \"Out! Now!\" I told him to pay me what he owed - I was leaving for good. He refused. The silent partner came over, peeled off my pay and an extra hundred from a fat roll in his suit pocket, and gave me a warm smile as he bade me goodbye. </p> <p>I don't know what happened to Billy's. It certainly never developed into a worldwide chain as my crazed boss had envisioned - or even a second store. The next time I was in the neighbourhood, a picture framer occupied the space where the restaurant had been. What happened to the old man and his dreams of a poultry empire for his son? I can only guess. </p> <p> After what he calls the \"wilderness years\" and an interlude launching a high-profile Tuscan restaurant, Bourdain happily fetched up two years ago as chef at Les Halles, a successful New York brasserie. He's there still, having also found time to write a couple of novels. </p> <p>There was a lull in service the other night, one of those all-too-brief periods of about 10 minutes when the floor staff is busy trying to turn tables, and even though the bar is packed three deep with waiting customers and there's a line out the door, the kitchen is quiet. </p> <p>I stood in the doorway to the cellar prep kitchen and smoked a cigarette nervously. We were in that eerie, eye-of-the-hurricane calm. When the next wave of hungry public had been seated and breaded and watered, there'd be a punishing rush. First, the salad guy would get hit, then the saut\u00e9 station and finally the grill, until everything came down at once - the whole bunch of us in the cramped kitchen struggling and sweating and cursing to move orders out without falling in the weeds. We had only a few moments of peace to go, and I smoked and fidgeted and half-listened to what my crew was talking about. </p> <p>The tone of the repartee was familiar, as was the subject matter - and I realised that, my God . . . I've been listening to the same conversation for 25 years ! </p> <p>Who's the bigger homo? Who takes it in the ass? Who, exactly, at this particular moment, is a p\u00e9d\u00e9, a maric\u00f3n, a fanocchio, a puta a pato? It's all about dick, you see. </p> <p>This is the real international language of cuisine, I realised, watching my French sous-chef, American ptissier, Mexican grill, salad and fry guys exchange playful insults with the Bengali runner and the Dominican dishwasher. </p> <p>As an art form, cooktalk is, like haiku or kabuki, defined by established rules, with a rigid, traditional framework in which one may operate. All comments must , out of historical necessity, concern involuntary rectal penetration, penis size, physical flaws or annoying mannerisms or defects. </p> <p>The rules can be confusing. Pinche wey means \"fucking guy\", but can also mean \"you adorable scamp\" or \"pal\". But if you use the word \"pal\" - or, worse, \"my friend\" - in my kitchen, it'll make people paranoid. \"My friend\" famously means \"asshole\" in the worst and most sincere sense of that word. And start being too nice to a cook on the line and he might think he's getting canned tomorrow. My vato locos are, like most line cooks, practitioners of that centuries-old oral tradition in which we - all of us - try to find new and amusing ways to talk about dick. </p> <p>Homophobic, you say? Sub-mental? Insensitive to gender preference, and the gorgeous mosaic of an ethnically diverse work force? Gee . . . you might be right. Does a locker-room environment like this make it tougher for women, for instance? Yep. Most women, sadly. But what the system seeks, what it requires, is someone, anyone , who can hold up their station, play the game without getting bent out of shape and taking things personally. </p> <p>But let's say you do \"take it in the twins\", it's no impediment to survival. We're too busy, and too close, and we spend too much time together as an extended, dysfunctional family to care about sex, gender preference, race or national origin. After level of skills, it's how sensitive you are to criticism and perceived insult - and how well you can give it right back - that determines your place in the food chain. I've been flaco and cadavro, probably borracho. That's just the way it is. I call down to my prep kitchen on the intercom - calling for butter or more sauce - and that little gangster who keeps my stock rotated and makes that lovely chiffonaded parsley for me is going to reply (after I'm out of hearing), \" Fuuck YOUU!! \" before giving me exactly what I asked for. Better I say it first: \"Gimme my fucking mantequilla and sauce, motherfucker. Horita . . . and . . . fuuuck YOU!\" And I love that little thug, too - the headband-sporting, baggy-pantsed, top button-buttoned, bottom button open, moon boot-shod, half Puerto Rican, half cholo vato loco, with his crude prison-style tats and his butterfly knife tucked in his wristband. I have, on many occasions, pondered adopting him. He's everything I'd want in a son. </p> <p>It's been 27 years since I walked into the Dreadnaught kitchen in Provincetown with my hair halfway down my back, a bad attitude, and a marginal desire to maybe do a little work in return for money. </p> <p>How much longer am I going to do this? </p> <p>I don't know. I love it, you see. </p> <p>I love heating duck confit, saucisson de canard, confit gizzards, saucisson de Toulouse, poitrine and duck fat with those wonderful tarbais beans, spooning it into an earthenware crock and sprinkling it with breadcrumbs. I love making those little mountains of chive-mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, ris de veau, a nice, tall micro-green salad as garnish, drizzling a perfectly reduced sauce around the plate with my favourite spoon. I enjoy the look on the face of my boss when I do a pot-au-feu special - the look of sheer delight as he takes the massive bowl of braised hooves, shoulders and tails in, the simple boiled turnips, potatoes and carrots looking just right, just the way it should be. I love that look, the same look I get when I approach a plate of perfect oysters.

      "bodyText": "August of our first summer in France was spent in La Teste sur Mer, a tiny oyster village on the Bassin d'Arcachon in the Gironde. We stayed with my aunt, Tante Jeanne, and my uncle, Oncle Gustav, in the same white stuccoed house where my father had summered as a boy. Tante Jeanne was a frumpy, bespectacled, slightly smelly old woman; Oncle Gustav, a geezer in coveralls and beret who smoked hand-rolled cigarettes until they disappeared on to the tip of his tongue. Little had changed about La Teste in the years since my father had vacationed there. The neighbours were still all oyster fishermen. Their families still raised rabbits and grew tomatoes in their backyards. Houses had two kitchens, an inside one and an outdoor \"fish kitchen\". There was a hand pump for drinking water from a well, and an outhouse by the rear of the garden. My brother and I were reasonably happy here. The beaches were warm, there were lizards to hunt down and exterminate with readily available p\u00e9tards, firecrackers, which one could buy legally (!) over-the-counter. There was a forest within walking distance where an actual hermit lived, and my brother and I spent hours there, spying on him from the underbrush. By now I could read comic books in French and, of course, I was eating - really eating. Murky brown soupe de poisson, tomato salad, moules marini\u00e8res, poulet basquaise (we were only a few miles from the Basque country). We made day trips to Cap Ferret, a wild, deserted and breathtakingly magnificent Atlantic beach with big rolling waves, taking along baguettes and saucissons and wheels of cheese, wine and Evian (bottled water was at that time unheard of back home). A few miles west was Lac Cazeaux, a fresh-water lake where my brother and I could rent p\u00e9dalo watercraft. We ate gaufres, delicious hot waffles, covered in whipped cream and powdered sugar. The two hot songs of that summer on the Cazeaux jukebox were Whiter Shade Of Pale by Procol Harum and These Boots Were Made For Walkin' by Nancy Sinatra. The French played those two songs over and over again, the music punctuated by the sonic booms from French air force jets that would swoop over the lake on their way to a nearby bombing range. When our neighbour, Monsieur Saint-Jour, the oyster fisherman, invited my family out on his penas (oyster boat), I was enthusiastic. At six in the morning, we boarded Monsieur Saint-Jour's small wooden vessel with our picnic baskets and our sensible footwear. He was a crusty old bastard, dressed like my uncle in ancient denim coveralls, espadrilles and beret. He had a leathery, tanned and windblown face, hollow cheeks, and the tiny broken blood vessels on his nose and cheeks that everyone seemed to have from drinking so much of the local Bordeaux. We put-putted out to a buoy marking his underwater oyster parc, a fenced-off section of the bay bottom, and we sat . . . and sat . . . and sat, in the roaring August sun, waiting for the tide to go out. The idea was to float the boat over the stockaded fence walls, then sit there as the boat slowly sank with the water level, until it rested on the basin floor. At this point, Monsieur Saint-Jour would rake the oysters, collect a few good specimens for sale in port, and remove any parasites that might be endangering his crop. There was, I recall, still about two feet of water left to go before the hull of the boat settled on dry ground and we could walk about the parc. We'd already polished off the Brie and baguettes, but I was still hungry, and characteristically said so. Monsieur Saint-Jour, on hearing this - as if challenging his American passengers - inquired in his thick Girondais accent if any of us would care to try an oyster. My parents hesitated. I doubt they'd realised they might have actually to eat one of the raw, slimy things we were currently floating over. My little brother recoiled in horror. But I, in the proudest moment of my young life, stood up smartly, grinning with defiance, and volunteered to be the first. And in that unforgettably sweet moment, that one moment still more alive for me than so many of the other \"firsts\" that followed - first sex, first joint, first day in high school, first published book - I attained glory. Monsieur Saint-Jour beckoned me over to the gunwale, where he leaned over, reached down until his head nearly disappeared underwater, and emerged holding a single silt-encrusted oyster, huge and irregularly shaped, in his rough, clawlike fist. With a snubby, rust-covered oyster knife, he popped the thing open and handed it to me, everyone watching now, my little brother shrinking away from this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive. I took it in my hand, tilted the shell back into my mouth as instructed by the by now beaming Monsieur Saint-Jour, and with one bite and a slurp wolfed it down. It tasted of seawater . . . of brine and flesh . . . and, somehow . . . of the future. Everything was different now. Everything. I'd not only survived - I'd enjoyed . This, I knew, was the magic I had until now been only dimly and spitefully aware of. I was hooked. My parents' shudders, my little brother's expression of unrestrained revulsion and amazement only reinforced the sense that I had, somehow, become a man. I had had an adventure , tasted forbidden fruit, and everything that followed in my life - the food, the long and often stupid and self-destructive chase for the next thing , whether it was drugs or sex or some other new sensation - would all stem from this moment. I'd learned something. Viscerally, instinctively, spiritually - even in some small, precursive way, sexually - and there was no turning back. The genie was out of the bottle. My life as a cook, and as a chef, had begun. In 1981, my good friend from high school, Sam G, became the chef de cuisine of Work Progress. A once-trendy restaurant on Spring Street in SoHo, the place had fallen on hard times. It was now under new ownership and Sammy - one of us ! - was in charge of putting the kitchen together. It was what a lot of us had been waiting for, our own thing, and the call went out to all our old cronies. From Provincetown, Cape Cod, where I'd had my first job as a dishwasher, came Dimitri, enticed by excited promises of culinary history in the making. From West Village saloons, we recruited every young, pot-smoking, head-banging hooligan we'd ever worked with, filling their heads with dreams of glory. \"We're forming . . . like . . . a rock-and-roll band, man, an all-star group of culinary superstars . . . kinda like Blind Faith. We're going to tear a new asshole into the New York restaurant scene.\" We fancied ourselves the most know-ledgeable and experienced young Turks in town, and our hearts were filled with hope and the promise of enviable futures. We thought we were the only cooks in New York who could quote from the Larousse Gastronomique and R\u00e9pertoire de la Cuisine, who knew who Vatel, Car me and Escoffier were, what Bocuse, Verg\u00e9 and Gu\u00e9rard were doing across the water, and we were determined to replicate their successes and their fame. There was no one on the horizon we could see who could touch us. The new owners of Work Progress, our putative masters, were a textbook example of People Who Should Never Own A Restaurant. There were two brothers - one half-smart, the other genuinely dumb - who'd gotten a few bucks from Mommy and Daddy, along with their partner, a slightly more cognizant college friend who could actually read a P and L sheet and crunch a few numbers. Their principal business was investing in off-Broadway shows. As this, apparently, wasn't unprofitable enough, they'd chosen the restaurant business as a way to lose their money more quickly and assuredly. From the get-go, Sammy, Dimitri and I managed to intimidate the partners right out of their own restaurant. At every suggestion from this novice triumvirate, we'd snort with contempt, roll our eyes with world-weary derision and shoot down whatever outrage - be it tablecloths, flatware or menu items - they'd come up with. We fought all the time, Sam, Dimitri and I. Waving our cookbooks at each other, we'd squabble endlessly over the \"correct\" way to prepare certain dishes. We teased, poked, prodded, sulked, conspired and competed. We wanted to be the best, we wanted to be different but, at the same time, correct. We came up with the looniest, most ambitious menu our endorphin-overloaded brains could agree on, a sort of Greatest Hits Of Our Checkered Careers So Far collection. French classics sat side-by-side with Portuguese squid stew, my Tante Jeanne's humble salade de tomates, dishes we'd lifted out of cookbooks, stolen from other chefs, remembered seeing on TV. There were Wellfleet oysters on the halfshell, there was a pasta dish from Mario's - a sort of taglierini with trail-mix and anchovies, as I recall - scallops in sorrel sauce (from Bocuse, maybe?), calves' liver with raspberry-vinegar sauce, swordfish with black beans and white rice, pompano en papillotte, my mom's cr\u00e8me renvers\u00e9e . . . We were high all the time, sneaking off to the walk-in at every opportunity to \"conceptualise\". Hardly a decision was made without drugs. We worked long hours and took considerable pride in our efforts - the drugs, we thought, having little effect on the end-product. That was what the life we were in was about, we believed. We might be tripping out on blotter acid, sleepless for three days and halfway through a bottle of Stoli, but we were professionals , goddammit! We didn't let it affect our line work. And we were happy, truly happy, like Henry V's lucky few, a band of brothers, ragged, slightly debauched warriors, who anticipated nothing less than total victory - an Agincourt of the mind and stomach. We were pretty busy initially and, along with the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who held us in something like awe, Sam, Dimitri and I would work all day and late into the night. When the restaurant closed, we'd take over the bar, drinking Cristal - which we'd buy at cost - and running fat rails of coke from one end of the bar to the other, then crawling along on all-fours to snort them. The cuter and more degenerate members of the floor staff would hang with us, so there was a lot of humping in the dry-goods area and on the banquettes, 50-pound flour sacks being popular staging areas for after-work copulation. A squadron of punk rocker junkie guitar heroes ate for free at Work Progress - so we got free tickets and backstage passes to the Mudd Club, CBGB, Tier Three, Hurrah, Club 57 and so on. And when the clubs closed it was off to after-hours, where we'd drink and do more drugs until, weather permitting, we'd hit the seven o'clock train to Long Beach. We'd finish the last of our smack on the train, then pass out on the beach. Whichever one of us woke from the nod would roll the others over to avoid an uneven burn. When we finally arrived back at work, sand in our hair, we looked tanned, rested and ready. We considered ourselves a tribe. As such, we had a number of unusual customs and rituals all our own. If you cut yourself in the Work Progress kitchen, tradition called for maximum spillage and dispersion of blood. One squeezed the wound till it ran freely, then hurled great gouts of red spray on the jackets and aprons of comrades. We loved blood in our kitchen. If you dinged yourself badly, it was no disgrace; we'd stencil a little cut-out shape of a chef knife under your station to commemorate the event. After a while, you'd have a little row of these things, like a fighter pilot. The house cat - a mouse-killer - got her own stencil (a tiny mouse shape) sprayed on the wall by her water bowl, signifying confirmed kills. We cared little for managers or owners - or customers, for that matter. Unsurprisingly, our restaurant was rapidly failing. I began to see, for the first time, what I would later recognise as Failing Restaurant Syndrome, an affliction that causes owners to flail about looking for a quick fix, a masterstroke that will \"turn things around\", reverse the already irreversible trend toward insolvency. We tried New Orleans Brunch - complete with Dixieland band. We tried a prix fixe menu, a Sunday night buffet, we advertised and we hired a publicist. Each successive brainstorm was more counterproductive than the one before. When the paychecks started bouncing, and the vendors started to put us on COD (cash on delivery), the owners called in the restaurant consultants. Even then, we knew what that meant: the consultants usually arrive just ahead of the repo men and the marshals. It was the death knell. We had tried. We had failed. Naturally, we held the owners responsible. It was a tough spot, the ambiance was no good, the music in the dining room sucked, the waiters weren't well trained . . . But the truth was, we just weren't good enough. Our food, while charming to some, was unappealing to most. We did not commit seppuku. Sam and Dimitri stayed on, determined to go down with the ship. But my cousin had hooked me up with my very first chef job, at a spanking-new but already troubled bote in the theatre district, and I jumped at the offer. I felt bad about leaving my friends behind. And I had the beginnings of a very nasty little heroin habit from all the dope I'd been sniffing - but hey! I was about to become a chef! It is one of the central ironies of my career that as soon as I got off heroin, things started getting really bad. High on dope, I was at least a chef, well paid, much liked by crew and floor and owners alike. Stabilised on methadone, I became nearly unemployable by polite society: a shiftless, untrustworthy coke-sniffer, sneak thief and corner-cutting hack, toiling in the culinary backwaters. I worked a seedy hotel on upper Madison, a place so slow that the one waiter would have to come downstairs and wake me when customers came in. I worked a lunch counter on Amsterdam, flipping pancakes and doing short-order eggs for politicos and their bagmen. I worked a bizarre combination art gallery/bistro on Columbus, just me and a coke-dealing bartender - a typically convenient and destructive symbiotic arrangement. I was a sous chef at a very fine two-star place on 39th, where I dimly recall preparing a four-course meal for Paul Bocuse; he thanked me in French, I think. I worked a deserted crab house on Second Avenue. I cooked brunches in SoHo, I slopped out steam-table chow at a bar on 8th Street to a bunch of drunks. For a time, I took another chef's job - of sorts - at a moment of need at Billy's, a combo sit-down/take-out upscale chicken joint on Bleecker Street. It was an operation that was to be the flagship of another planned empire, a chain of chicken joints that would stretch across the globe. At this low point in my career, I didn't care if the place succeeded or not. I needed the money. My boss was an older Jewish guy, fresh out of prison, who'd named the place after his youngest son, Billy, a feckless ne'er-do-well. He had been, in an earlier life, the head of the counting room at a Las Vegas casino and, after being caught skimming off millions for the \"boys back in New York and Cincinnati\", had been offered a friendly deal should he co-operate with the prosecutors. He had, admirably, declined, and as a result spent the last five years eating prison chow. When he got out, a near-broken man, his old buddies in New York, being Men of Honour, set him up with this restaurant as a sign of gratitude for services rendered. Unfortunately, while in prison, the old man had completely lost his mind. He may have been a stand-up guy, but he was absolutely barking mad. This was not a classic bust-out operation, where the mob deliberately runs a place into the ground, using a front man/straw owner to run up bills, then pillage the place for merchandise and credit. I think that the wise guys really wanted the poor slob to make money and be a success. They made earnest efforts to help at every turn, enduring much nonsense from their visibly deranged partner. I'd seen mobsters around before, of course, but I'd never worked in a place that was out-and-out mobbed up, where I came to know on a personal basis real wise guys, whose names I recognised from the papers. Everyone was astonishingly up-front about their connections. My boss was fond of yelling into the phone when discussing prices with a purveyor, \"You know who I am? You know who I'm with ?!\" We did things differently at Billy's. My cooks, for one: every one of them came from the Fortune Society, guys who spent their off-hours in halfway houses, allowed out only to work. I was used to working with a fairly rough bunch, a lot of whom, at one time or another, had had problems with the law - but at Billy's every single one of my cooks was still basically a convict. I can't say that it was an unhappy arrangement, either; for once, I knew my cooks were going to show up at work every day - if they didn't, they went back to prison. And credit was easily obtained. I knew, from previous experience, how difficult it is to set up terms for a new restaurant; even getting a week's credit with some of these companies was usually a lengthy process, involving credit applications, a long wait, initial periods of cash on delivery. At Billy's, no sooner was I off the phone than the stuff was arriving, often on 60-day terms. My boss spent a lot of time on the phone, investigating the serious business of horses and their bloodlines, and how well they ran in mud or on grass. Billy himself, at 18, was happy to drive his sports car around and chase girls. So my day-to-day was spent mostly with some genial gentlemen from an Italian Fraternal Organisation. They helpfully told me where to buy my meat and poultry, and how to meet the folks who would be supplying my linen, bread, paper goods and so on. I had a lot of meetings in cars. \"The bread guy is here,\" I'd be told, and a late-model Buick would pull up out front. An old guy in a mashed-down golf cap would beckon me from the driver's seat and then get out of the car. The older guy in the passenger seat would slide over, indicating he wanted me to get in, sit next to him and talk. We'd sit there in the idling car, talking cryptically about bread, before he brought me around to the trunk to examine some product. It was a strange business. My boss got wackier and wackier. When we finally opened, we were packed from the first minute. Orders flooded in over the phone and at the counter and at the tables. We were unprepared and understaffed, so the Italian contingent - including various visiting dignitaries, all with oddly anglicised names (\"This is Mr Dee, Tony, and meet a friend, Mr Brown . . . This is Mr Lang\"), all of them overweight, cigar-chomping, middle-aged guys with bodyguards and 10,000-dollar watches - pitched in to help out. Guys I'd read about later in the papers as running construction in the outer boroughs, purported killers, made men, who lived in concrete piles on Staten Island and Long Beach and security-fenced estates in Jersey, carried brown paper bags of chicken sandwiches up three flights of stairs to Greenwich Village walk-up apartments to make deliveries; they slathered mayo and avocado slices on pitta bread behind the counter, and bussed tables in the dining room. I have to say I liked them for that. But when my boss, inexplicably, showed up one day and told me to fire everyone with a tattoo on my staff, I was faced with a dilemma. Every one of my cooks was festooned with prison tats: screaming skulls, Jesus on hypodermic crosses, bound in barbed wire, gang tats, flaming dice, swastikas, SS flashes, Born to Lose, Born Dead, Love Hate, Mom, portraits of the Madonna, wives, girlfriends, Ozzy Osbourne. I tried to put him off, explaining that we couldn't do without these guys, that the hardest-working, most indispensable guy we had - the guy who right now was loading trash cans with hundreds of marinating chicken parts in the cramped, stifling unrefrigerated cellar on his 22nd consecutive double shift - he was a goddamn Sistine Chapel of skin art. And where am I going to find a convict without a tattoo? The Watergate burglars weren't, to my knowledge, available. Things only got worse. He came in the next day, obsessing about gold chains and jewellery. My grill man had the usual ghetto adornments of the day. \"Where do you think that eggplant [aubergine] got all that gold?\" he raved, spraying food and saliva as he talked. \"Selling drugs. That shit is poison ! Mugging old ladies! I don't want that in my restaurant! Get him out!\" This was clearly impossible, and I sought counsel with one of the silent partners who, as my boss had become increasingly unpredictable, had grown noticeably less silent. \"You hear what he wants me to do?\" I asked. The man just nodded and rolled his eyes, sympathetically, I thought. \"Do nothing,\" he said, and then, with truly dangerous intonation, added, \"Aspetta,\" meaning \"Wait\" in Italian. I didn't like the sound of that. He smiled at me, and I couldn't help picturing my boss, slumped over a dashboard after one of those meetings in a car they were all so fond of. When things came to a head a few days later, my boss openly screaming in the middle of a crowded dining room that he wanted all the tattooed guys and gold chain-wearers \"Out! Now!\" I told him to pay me what he owed - I was leaving for good. He refused. The silent partner came over, peeled off my pay and an extra hundred from a fat roll in his suit pocket, and gave me a warm smile as he bade me goodbye. I don't know what happened to Billy's. It certainly never developed into a worldwide chain as my crazed boss had envisioned - or even a second store. The next time I was in the neighbourhood, a picture framer occupied the space where the restaurant had been. What happened to the old man and his dreams of a poultry empire for his son? I can only guess. After what he calls the \"wilderness years\" and an interlude launching a high-profile Tuscan restaurant, Bourdain happily fetched up two years ago as chef at Les Halles, a successful New York brasserie. He's there still, having also found time to write a couple of novels. There was a lull in service the other night, one of those all-too-brief periods of about 10 minutes when the floor staff is busy trying to turn tables, and even though the bar is packed three deep with waiting customers and there's a line out the door, the kitchen is quiet. I stood in the doorway to the cellar prep kitchen and smoked a cigarette nervously. We were in that eerie, eye-of-the-hurricane calm. When the next wave of hungry public had been seated and breaded and watered, there'd be a punishing rush. First, the salad guy would get hit, then the saut\u00e9 station and finally the grill, until everything came down at once - the whole bunch of us in the cramped kitchen struggling and sweating and cursing to move orders out without falling in the weeds. We had only a few moments of peace to go, and I smoked and fidgeted and half-listened to what my crew was talking about. The tone of the repartee was familiar, as was the subject matter - and I realised that, my God . . . I've been listening to the same conversation for 25 years ! Who's the bigger homo? Who takes it in the ass? Who, exactly, at this particular moment, is a p\u00e9d\u00e9, a maric\u00f3n, a fanocchio, a puta a pato? It's all about dick, you see. This is the real international language of cuisine, I realised, watching my French sous-chef, American ptissier, Mexican grill, salad and fry guys exchange playful insults with the Bengali runner and the Dominican dishwasher. As an art form, cooktalk is, like haiku or kabuki, defined by established rules, with a rigid, traditional framework in which one may operate. All comments must , out of historical necessity, concern involuntary rectal penetration, penis size, physical flaws or annoying mannerisms or defects. The rules can be confusing. Pinche wey means \"fucking guy\", but can also mean \"you adorable scamp\" or \"pal\". But if you use the word \"pal\" - or, worse, \"my friend\" - in my kitchen, it'll make people paranoid. \"My friend\" famously means \"asshole\" in the worst and most sincere sense of that word. And start being too nice to a cook on the line and he might think he's getting canned tomorrow. My vato locos are, like most line cooks, practitioners of that centuries-old oral tradition in which we - all of us - try to find new and amusing ways to talk about dick. Homophobic, you say? Sub-mental? Insensitive to gender preference, and the gorgeous mosaic of an ethnically diverse work force? Gee . . . you might be right. Does a locker-room environment like this make it tougher for women, for instance? Yep. Most women, sadly. But what the system seeks, what it requires, is someone, anyone , who can hold up their station, play the game without getting bent out of shape and taking things personally. But let's say you do \"take it in the twins\", it's no impediment to survival. We're too busy, and too close, and we spend too much time together as an extended, dysfunctional family to care about sex, gender preference, race or national origin. After level of skills, it's how sensitive you are to criticism and perceived insult - and how well you can give it right back - that determines your place in the food chain. I've been flaco and cadavro, probably borracho. That's just the way it is. I call down to my prep kitchen on the intercom - calling for butter or more sauce - and that little gangster who keeps my stock rotated and makes that lovely chiffonaded parsley for me is going to reply (after I'm out of hearing), \" Fuuck YOUU!! \" before giving me exactly what I asked for. Better I say it first: \"Gimme my fucking mantequilla and sauce, motherfucker. Horita . . . and . . . fuuuck YOU!\" And I love that little thug, too - the headband-sporting, baggy-pantsed, top button-buttoned, bottom button open, moon boot-shod, half Puerto Rican, half cholo vato loco, with his crude prison-style tats and his butterfly knife tucked in his wristband. I have, on many occasions, pondered adopting him. He's everything I'd want in a son. It's been 27 years since I walked into the Dreadnaught kitchen in Provincetown with my hair halfway down my back, a bad attitude, and a marginal desire to maybe do a little work in return for money. How much longer am I going to do this? I don't know. I love it, you see. I love heating duck confit, saucisson de canard, confit gizzards, saucisson de Toulouse, poitrine and duck fat with those wonderful tarbais beans, spooning it into an earthenware crock and sprinkling it with breadcrumbs. I love making those little mountains of chive-mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, ris de veau, a nice, tall micro-green salad as garnish, drizzling a perfectly reduced sauce around the plate with my favourite spoon. I enjoy the look on the face of my boss when I do a pot-au-feu special - the look of sheer delight as he takes the massive bowl of braised hooves, shoulders and tails in, the simple boiled turnips, potatoes and carrots looking just right, just the way it should be. I love that look, the same look I get when I approach a plate of perfect oysters. It's a gaze of wonder: the same look you see on small children's faces when their fathers take them into deep water at the beach, and it's always a beautiful thing. For a moment, or a second, the pinched expressions of the cynical, world-weary, throat-cutting, miserable bastards we've all had to become disappears when we're confronted with a something as simple as a plate of food. When we remember what it was that moved us down this road in the first place.

Between times, I drifted off to sleep and dreamt that I was stuck in the checkout queue behind Tara Palmer-Tomkinson. Nine trolleys. Poor thing. It rained fish in Great Yarmouth. Johnny Hallyday is the third most popular person in France. Macaulay Culkin has separated from Rachel, his wife of two years, presumably because he put his hands on his cheeks and went, \"Waaaaaaaaagh!\" once too often. A law has been passed in Colorado to reduce farmyard noises and smells - farmers can be fined up to $350 if their cows' mooing or accumulated pat odour exceed guidelines.</p> <p>I read that last one four times. It was in the Telegraph, so it can't be a joke.

Between times, I drifted off to sleep and dreamt that I was stuck in the checkout queue behind Tara Palmer-Tomkinson. Nine trolleys. Poor thing. It rained fish in Great Yarmouth. Johnny Hallyday is the third most popular person in France. Macaulay Culkin has separated from Rachel, his wife of two years, presumably because he put his hands on his cheeks and went, \"Waaaaaaaaagh!\" once too often. A law has been passed in Colorado to reduce farmyard noises and smells - farmers can be fined up to $350 if their cows' mooing or accumulated pat odour exceed guidelines. I read that last one four times. It was in the Telegraph, so it can't be a joke.

      "body": "<p><strong> Comedy</strong><br> <strong> Scott Capurro</strong><br> *****<br> Pleasance </p> <p> There are no sacred cows for Scott Capurro. Everything and everyone is waiting for the slaughter, himself included. Capurro has always been a really smart comic but never an amiable one. He looks cute - and when he opens his mouth, he maims.</p> <p> Over the years his humour has gone way beyond the classic American gay bitch into the realm of the bite. This year it really festers. He gets right down to business. Within minutes he has jokes about child abuse, the Irish, Birmingham (\"Satan's arsehole\"), Wales, whether Jesus was gay (\"Mary Magdalene - a classic fag-hag\"), and blacks. Then it is on to the Jews. There is a Holocaust tattoo joke that makes the audience gasp then laugh. \"Holocaust, Schmolocaust,\" he counters. There is a silence that feels like hours before the first wave of laughter. The walk-outs begin. \"Now I can't tell my Hitler jokes.\" </p> <p> Capurro's show is not for the easily offended but it is for anyone interested in testing the limits of comedy. It's not about how far Capurro will go but how far an audience will go. It is about who has the right to tell jokes about whom, about our obsession with political correctness and victimhood. \"God, I wish I'd been fisted by my uncle. I wish I was black and in a wheelchair.\" Perhaps, most profoundly, it's about whether after Auschwitz and Aids there's anything left to laugh at in the world. </p> <p> In a sense Capurro is grappling with something that the comedy world has preferred to ignore: why it is deemed unacceptable for Bernard Manning to tell jokes about women and blacks, but fine for black and female comics to denigrate themselves, non-blacks and men. It is about the way that everytime we laugh we betray our true selves, what we really think. Laughter lays us naked, and Capurro makes us blush with shame. <br> Lyn Gardner </p> <p> Till August 28. Box office: 0131-556 6550. </p> <p><strong>John Hegley: Dog</strong><br> ****<br> Assembly Rooms </p> <p> If you want to see a man about a dog, make it John Hegley. His idiosyncratic multimedia show picks over the bones of canine culture and man's relationship with his best friend (no, not that one). His finer moments involve a struggle between subservience and dominance over the much-loved barker. He tells how his ex-girlfriend Pat poured out her love one enchanted evening, only for Hegley to turn and realise she was talking to the mutt.</p> <p> Taking hilarious if disturbing revenge, Relaxing With Taxidermy extols the benefits of having your dog stuffed on the mantelpiece (\"She'll always look at the camera now!\"). Hegley takes obvious pleasure in inserting his arm into the anus of Herman Hessian, his puppet \"Sack Russell\" (sensibly, he warns not to try it with the family dog). However, behind the tomfoolery lie attempts to provoke.</p> <p> A harrowing poem about the death of his father is followed by a daft caricature of the man himself. You laugh, but feel uncertain. Is this man a philosopher in the body of a madman? Or a natural comic troubled by the urge to be profound? Like a bespectacled, tight- suited hybrid of William Burroughs and John Cooper-Clarke, Hegley is a master of disconcerting, sardonic disdain. <br> Dave Simpson </p> <p> Till August 28. Box office: 0131-624 0202. </p> <p><strong> The Leisure Virus</strong><br> ***<br> Gilded Balloon Cave </p> <p> Take three men, one woman, two chairs, one wig and a towel and the result is The Leisure Virus. Loosely related to the League of Gentlemen/ Fast Show school of weirdness, the Virus team infect the audience with so much laughter that someone should call a paramedic. The Virus humour is funny-peculiar rather than the plain sickness that often accompanies such comedy. Unmissable sketches include the man with a secret life as a human beatbox, the murderous barber who saves hair for his wig, and, gloriously, the hi-fi customer requiring a CD player with a penis (\"a proper one, not one of those Japanese models\"). The whole thing is brilliantly acted by a quartet with real presence. </p> <p> As newcomers they don't quite sustain the thrills; the second half tails off once they start copying Rowan Atkinson's classic racist policeman sketch. Well worth seeing, though, especially for struggling hi-fi salespersons.<br> Dave Simpson </p> <p> Till August 28. Box office: 0131-226 2151.</p> <p><strong> Dominic Frisby</strong><br> ****<br> Komedia </p> <p> Just before the festival, Dominic Frisby was half of double act Asprey and Frisby, until a shock call from Hollywood prompted Asprey to pull out. With just three weeks' notice, Frisby rebuilt the act as a one-man show. However, judging from the healthy turnout (including fellow comics Chris Addison and Dan Antopolski) and near-rapturous response, it's this half of the package that may well go on to see his name in lights.</p> <p> Frisby's forte is Lee Mack-ish sketch comedy with an inventive irreverence worthy of Not the Nine O'Clock News. Unusual but hugely funny spoofs include The Sexual Odours in Morris Dancing and Heaven's Call Centre (\"press 5 for Methodist, 6 for suicide and other cults\"). God knows where he gets these ideas, and God might not be pleased about them. However, some form of deity is surely responsible for Frisby's comic face, which seems to have been made from a rubber ball. The fabulous fissog excels during mimed spoofs to disembodied backing tapes and a succession of witty characters. Rap music will probably not appreciate the Upper Class Raah-per, and Frisby's viciously funny Appalling Bridegroom Speech will do irreparable damage to the marriage rates. You might not want his hand in wedlock, but Frisby is a comic catch. <br>Dave Simpson</p> <p> Till August 27. Box office: 0131-6672212.</p> <p><strong>Theatre</strong></p> <p> <strong> Maybellene: The Living Fashion Doll</strong><br> ***<br> Pleasance</p> <p> Meet Maybellene. She has the body of a puppet, the head of a drag queen and the brain of Doris Day crossed with Einstein. She is queen of her 50s suburban American kitchen. She has everything a girl could want: a washer, a drier and a walk-in Frigidaire. But our heroine is still lonely and spends her day experimenting with new cleaning products while dreaming of film star Harry Heartthrob. </p> <p>Then Harry goes missing in the Bermuda Triangle. Can Maybellene save her dreamboat from disaster? Is the earth round? Kitsch 'n' Sync drama, one of two 15-minute Maybellene mini-musicals that are camping out in a small tent in the Pleasance courtyard, won't tax your brain. But if you have a penchant for 50s songs, domestic hygiene and extreme kitsch you will have a ball with the little lady. Barbie better watch her back: this girl is going to be big. <br> Lyn Gardner</p> <p> Till August 28. Box office: 0131-556 6550.</p> <p> <strong> The Donkey Show</strong><br> ***<br> Pleasance @ Potterow </p> <p> This show is to Shakespeare what Pot Noodle is to haute cuisine. But, hell, sometimes it is Pot Noodle that you fancy. Ostensibly it is A Midsummer Night's Dream performed in a disco run by the sinister DJ Oberon, who takes his revenge on Titania not with flower juice but a big spoonful of coke. In reality, it is difficult to know which is more of a handicap: knowing or not knowing Shakespeare's original. In the end this is just an excuse for a good boogie to a raft of 70s hits, from Car Wash to You Sexy Thing, performed by a gender bending cast who look terrific wearing very little except body glitter and a discretely placed butterfly.</p> <p> When Demetrios rejects Helena she sings Don't Leave Me This Way, which makes dramatic sense. After that nobody really bothers to make the song fit the situation. There are curiosities: for a long time I wondered why Tweedledum and Tweedledee had wandered into the proceedings and assumed that the American producers had got their English literature confused. But then these wise-cracking twins turn into the donkey. </p> <p>Up to this point I thought how much 10-year-olds would enjoy the glittery camp glamour of the piece and its raucous energy. I regret that what the donkey gets up makes that entirely out of the question. Shows such as the rock'n'roll Return to Forbidden Planet, based on the Tempest, have put the shake into Shakespeare far more successfully and with greater wit and theatrical verve. This is just a bit of hedonistic, decadent, disco fun.</p> <p> If you expect theatre, you will be disappointed, but if you can still squeeze into your hot pants and think the glitter ball made a bigger contribution to the last millennium than Shakespeare, you'll be in a kind of Heaven, if not heaven. <br> Lyn Gardner</p> <p> Till August 28. Box office: 0131-556 6550.</p> <p><strong>Dance</strong></p> <p><strong> Camut Band</strong><br> ****<br> Dynamic Earth</p> <p> These guys are finger-clickin' good. To set the beat, three men, each on a drum, lay back and tap. They're big African drums and, with amplified feet upon them, they make a lot of noise. We're hooked. And for the next hour, the house is charged with Iberian charisma. </p> <p> Tap dancers have had good press on the Fringe in recent years and this band of five is no exception. Wearing the black-shirted, silver-belted look of the \"I've been around\" flamenco dancer, they prowl the stage with cool steps. They are handsome and elegantly macho. Capturing tap, the New York street dance of the 30s, for their own, they play around with African instruments and smoochie keyboards. Sand, like the drums, gets danced on by the youngest member of the group, soft-shoe style.</p> <p> Even their chiselled faces get a dancing part. Lluis, Rafael and Tony have perfected a sitting in a bar routine, jawing through a conversation in a gloriously staccato gobbledegook which imitates the clatter of dancing feet. Then they dance it, throwing in a part for the audience. Sophisticated fun in good measure, this band blends a cocktail of styles guaranteed to perk up the most jaded festival goer. <br> Alice Bain </p> <p> Till August 17. Box office: 0131-530 3557.</p>",

Disgust, in other words, is visceral. </p> <p> But disgust is aroused not merely by the smell of rancid food. It can be a repugnance, an aversion or repulsion for certain acts or persons. These acts may be trivial: nose-picking, for example. Or they may be appalling: murder. The disparity suggests perhaps some of the range and complexity of this very strange and troubling emotion. Disgust can be directed towards many things, but it is always about something: it is not merely a state of mind. In order for disgust to function fully as an emotion there must be not merely a disgustee but also a disguster, or disgustant. And these are legion.</p> <p> DH Lawrence, for example, didn't like bats, \"Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;/ And disgustingly upside down./ Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags\".

Imagine if you had suffered some kind of brain lesion that prevented you from feeling disgust. You might end up eating contaminated food, food that was crawling with maggots, or absent-mindedly scoffing on your own faeces, and you'd soon get sick. It's therefore important, under certain circumstances, to loathe, to detest, to abhor and to abominate. We must sometimes turn away. We should and we do distinguish between the pure and the impure.</p> <p> Of course, a problem occurs when our feelings of disgust are used to sanction certain forms of social behaviour, when there's a simple connection made between emotion and action. I may read the News of the World, for example, and become disgusted by the thought of paedophiles and their activities. This is fine. But if I therefore decide to go to someone's house, post dogshit through the letter box, burn their car, and beat them with a large stick, this is not so fine. Incapable of distinguishing between morality and rage, the News of the World prizes disgust, which is itself disgusting. Disgust should not be rewarded: to do so is to sink into debasement. </p> <p> Salman Rushdie, himself an object of disgust, once warned that \"We, the public, are easily, lethally offended.

      "body": "<p> It was about pub closing time when the man in the smart blue shirt detached himself from the crowd along Old Compton Street and approached our table. He was tall and polite-looking and slightly thick at the waist, a young executive perhaps, without his jacket and tie. He was carrying an overnight bag over one shoulder, but his plans for the evening, at that moment, were growing blurred.</p> <p> His face, in the sticky Soho light, had gone wet and pale. His eyes were big and puzzled. And as he stepped towards us between the jostling minicabs and rickshaws, the clots of drinkers and the discarded mixer bottles, the shouts and debris of a Thursday night in the playpen of London, his walk had a veering, uncontrolled quality.</p> <p> He reached the kerb, gazed at us for a second, and barrelled past. There was a loud slap close behind us. \"Oh sorry\", said the man, standing and staring down. On the pavement a star-shape of vomit, frothy and beer-coloured, was spreading slowly gutterwards. The man looked surprised. And then he lurched off in the direction of Chinatown. </p> <p> Such behaviour, you might imagine, is traditional in Soho. In 1771, The Universal Magazine reported \"diverse loose, idle and disorderly persons . . . during the whole night, rioting and otherwise misbehaving themselves\". Ever since, the stale-smelling maze between Oxford Street, Regent Street and the Charing Cross Road has been shorthand for the saltier opportunities provided by the capital. </p> <p> The roads into Soho remain narrow and confusing, the buildings high and as jammed together as any walled city's, the air slightly fuggy and listless along the old brick canyons.</p> <p> Soho's uneven pavements, in particular, can seem like a mosaic of stains, coloured brown and black and dirty grey with the indiscretions of centuries. But Soho is not solely a kind of ancient theme park. Above its ground-floor neon and come-ons, up in the soupy darkness, there are bedroom curtains and plants on windowsills, boxy hot living rooms, housing association flats and millionaires' roof gardens.</p> <p> The area, as it has always done, has residents: between 5,000 and 6,000 by most estimates. Some of them grew up here; others moved in to relish the diversions. Yet, as a place to live, Soho seems suddenly to have become intolerable.</p> <p> \"The relentless increase in the number of food and drinking premises of all types, the rapid increase in late-night licences, the increasing noise levels at all hours, the filth and rubbish on the streets, the aggressive begging and the alarming spread in drug-dealing\" is leading, according to the Soho Clarion, the neighbourhood's 28-year-old community newspaper, to the \"collapse\" of local amenities and \"the destruction of the Soho community\". </p> <p> Westminster council, in less vivid language, agrees. \"We think the area has reached saturation point,\" says Angela Hooper, the head of the planning and licensing committee. On a busy night - and this can now mean almost any night of the week - between 20,000 and 60,000 people go out in Soho. Since 1996, by the council's figures (the Clarion's are higher), the number of premises licensed for \"music and dancing beyond 1am\" has doubled in the west end. </p> <p> There are at least 208 such venues now; the majority are in Soho - in addition, says Hooper, to \"maybe a dozen\" illegal drinkers' back rooms and cellars. And along with this bar boom have come others: in illicit minicabs and outdoor tables, in noisy refurbishments and round-the-clock refuse collection, in all the activities accompanying Britain's first substantial experiment in 24-hour living. </p> <p> Of late, Westminster council, which is Conservative-controlled and is not elected, you might guess, by the capital's hedonists, has been losing patience with its Soho laboratory. There have been confiscations of pavement tables. There has been talk of creating \"quiet enclaves\" with early curfews. And there has been the abandonment, after a few months, of a partial pedestrianisation of the area - the car-free streets, say the council, became choked with drunk people, pickpockets and beggars. </p> <p> All this is of more than local significance. If Soho cannot balance city-centre living and late-night pleasure, then perhaps this mixture will ultimately fail elsewhere in Britain too.</p> <p> From Leeds to Glasgow, councils have sought in recent years to regenerate their old and frayed urban cores by encouraging new flats and nightclubs. This year the government has published a white paper proposing the extension of licensing hours. The assumption behind such initiatives is that, as seems to be the case in the continental venues where Britons holiday, the presence of large numbers of people on the streets at night is a civilising influence. The white paper specifically recommends \"more flexible\" closing times in order \"to minimise public disorder\". </p> <p> Fred Proud disagrees. He has edited the last three, apocalyptic editions of the Soho Clarion, has lived in the area for 30 years, and sits, slightly jittery with insomnia, on the licensing committee of the Soho Society, the local residents' association. Both of these institutions are run from a small thick-walled refuge inside a church tower just off Wardour Street.</p> <p> Outside the room's high, barred windows, the nearby bars are already thudding with house music in mid-afternoon; the traffic is backing up along Shaftesbury Avenue; the church doorway has drawn a whole family of homeless sunbathers. Inside, though, the tower is cool and near-silent. There is a wall display about 18th-century Soho, with pure vistas of Georgian terracing. A couple of Proud's colleagues sit at desks, elderly and self-possessed, reading with spectacles on chains. He leads the way up a tiny spiral staircase to the committee room above and starts complaining. </p> <p> \"The council say one thing in their policy statements and do exactly the other . . . More and more people are coming in from the suburbs. They are not locals. They're never locals . . . The [London] Evening Standard is not on our side at all. They say the colourful character of Soho is why we live here - that's bollocks . . . The police have altered which laws they enforce.\"</p> <p> Proud is a lanky middle-aged man with the tan and trainers of the informally employed (he writes and started the Soho Theatre), but he has the furious eyes of a mild person roused. \"I rang the council's noise enforcement team yesterday,\" he continues, \"at, I think, 8.43 in the evening.\" Westminster council responds to such complaints in language watered down with euphemism. Places where residents' and revellers' interests clash are \"stress areas\". The great road-blocking clusters of people standing outside Soho pubs are examples of \"vertical drinking\". </p> <p> A fortnight ago, the council held a photocall in nearby Covent Garden to publicise its latest anti-disturbance catchphrases. A set of scales and two pieces of cardboard reading \"a good night's sleep\" and \"a good night out\" were produced, slightly unfortunately, out of a carrier bag from an off-licence. Hooper and the leader of Camden council, which shares Westminster's anxiety about the impending extension of drinking opportunities, stood sternly in the sunshine holding the scales. It was four o'clock on a Monday afternoon. We were among shops and offices, not even in Soho at all. The notion of roaring down Dean Street in the bleary hours seemed as distant as Mars.</p> <p> Afterwards Hooper, who lives west of Soho in tranquil St James's, gave a crisp interview. She would not be granting any more late licences in Soho. Enforcement teams were being sent there after dark, in plain-clothes twos and threes, to ensure good behaviour by the existing venues. Every now and again, despite her Tory grandee's vowels, she risked a more permissive note: \"I think everybody should enjoy a drink.\" But when I asked about building more public toilets, and improving the pavements, and generally making Soho better suited to night-time bustle, her fluency suddenly disappeared. She just stared back. The \"employment opportunities\" Westminster were so keen on did not, it seemed, require public investment as well. What about spreading Soho's burden across neighbouring areas? Another uncomprehending pause. \"It's easier to send enforcement teams into a contained area.\" </p> <p> Three nights later, it was ideal drinking weather in Soho. The day's rain had faded, it was not too hot for crowded bars, and the police were scarce and staying in their cars. At each crossroads and along the rackety thoroughfare of Old Compton Street, people were eddying about in small groups, most of them young, some of them tourists, some holding bottles, others spotting tables for cappuccinos. Only the odd person was urinating in the gutters.</p> <p>Hooper and Proud had both mentioned a particular cluster of bars. Around Meard Street, a narrow previously residential enclave, three competing branches of the Pitcher and Piano, Slug and Lettuce, and All Bar One chains had recently opened. Each of them, by Soho standards, was vast: on several levels, or forming a deep L-shape of polished wood and glass, the floorboards barely visible beneath all the people in suits and chinos, shouting to make themselves heard.</p> <p> It looked a bit bland and relentless, but it was hard to be outraged. The noise was penned indoors. By 11.30, the staff were sweeping the floors. Two evenings later, last Saturday, the \"cesspit\" Proud had promised was more in evidence. It was hotter; Old Compton Street felt more leering; there were chants and the clink of kicked bottles. In the doorway of the Pitcher and Piano just after closing time, pint glasses had been smashed; a chest-high mountain of rubbish sacks had already been decorated with rivers of urine. Meard Street had its own tributaries. </p> <p> A street away, two of Westminster's enforcement officers hurried off in the opposite direction. One of the men was small and carried a clipboard, the other was big and trod heavily behind, lit cigarette in hand. They circled westwards, peering at the street signs and fleetingly into bars. A thin woman slid out of the shadows among the shuttered Berwick Street market stalls, offered \"black lady, Chinese lady, Asian lady\" and was ignored.</p> <p> The officers reached Brewer Street, a blaze of neon and late clubs. A burglar alarm was shrieking in a doorway. They stopped finally for a minute, had a look, and walked on. The alarm and the sound systems all around blared on. It was well past midnight.</p> <p> Immediately above, in his tight attic flat, with his wax earplugs and double glazing, Proud had his lights off. Soho, in truth, has probably always been too small and too central for its inhabitants' peace of mind. In the 1630s, when the first drinking club was established, it was still mostly fields, but a habit was forming: Londoners headed westwards from the City for debauchery. In 1775, when Soho was still mostly mansions, a hungover Boswell wrote about the impossibility of having a lie-in. The carriages on the cobbles, the shouting street-vendors, and the hammering of local workshops only worsened as the area became poorer during the 19th century.</p> <p> Karl Marx fled the \"hellish muck\" surrounding his flat for the stillness of the British Library. By 1900, Soho squeezed in 12,000 residents. On summer nights, they put armchairs on the pavements and talked late. But outsiders - visiting servicemen in wartime, later football fans and roaming teenagers - were commonly held to blame for disturbances.</p> <p> Any small shift in the capital's appetites could swamp the area: by the 70s the sex industry seemed likely to beckon from every doorway. The Soho Society harassed it through the courts; the local smartening-up that followed during the 80s and 90s, the arrival of interior-designed restaurants and offices, led arguably to the loud suits-and-cocktails culture that so grates with the Society today. It may really be the big new bars' sameness that scares them. For the Pitcher and Piano chain, \"There was a space in the market in Soho for a safe-feeling pub,\" a spokeswoman says. \"A group of women going out for a few bottles of wine might not like the other places.\"</p> <p> This could be a recipe for suburbanisation, or turning Soho into a pure tourist attraction. Already on Old Compton Street, the tables are full of out-of-town families, just staring. At its eastern end, in Maison Bertaux, a small and paint-chipped French patisserie since 1871, the new Soho is politely scorned. \"It's a bit boring,\" says Michelle Wade, the long-standing owner, between flirting theatrically with her regulars. \"The age range is narrowing. You don't want it turning into Agia Napa, do you?\" She kissed another cheek. \"Although, I, personally, can stay up all night.\"</p>",

One of the men was small and carried a clipboard, the other was big and trod heavily behind, lit cigarette in hand. They circled westwards, peering at the street signs and fleetingly into bars. A thin woman slid out of the shadows among the shuttered Berwick Street market stalls, offered \"black lady, Chinese lady, Asian lady\" and was ignored. The officers reached Brewer Street, a blaze of neon and late clubs. A burglar alarm was shrieking in a doorway. They stopped finally for a minute, had a look, and walked on. The alarm and the sound systems all around blared on. It was well past midnight. Immediately above, in his tight attic flat, with his wax earplugs and double glazing, Proud had his lights off. Soho, in truth, has probably always been too small and too central for its inhabitants' peace of mind. In the 1630s, when the first drinking club was established, it was still mostly fields, but a habit was forming: Londoners headed westwards from the City for debauchery. In 1775, when Soho was still mostly mansions, a hungover Boswell wrote about the impossibility of having a lie-in. The carriages on the cobbles, the shouting street-vendors, and the hammering of local workshops only worsened as the area became poorer during the 19th century. Karl Marx fled the \"hellish muck\" surrounding his flat for the stillness of the British Library. By 1900, Soho squeezed in 12,000 residents. On summer nights, they put armchairs on the pavements and talked late. But outsiders - visiting servicemen in wartime, later football fans and roaming teenagers - were commonly held to blame for disturbances. Any small shift in the capital's appetites could swamp the area: by the 70s the sex industry seemed likely to beckon from every doorway. The Soho Society harassed it through the courts; the local smartening-up that followed during the 80s and 90s, the arrival of interior-designed restaurants and offices, led arguably to the loud suits-and-cocktails culture that so grates with the Society today. It may really be the big new bars' sameness that scares them. For the Pitcher and Piano chain, \"There was a space in the market in Soho for a safe-feeling pub,\" a spokeswoman says. \"A group of women going out for a few bottles of wine might not like the other places.\" This could be a recipe for suburbanisation, or turning Soho into a pure tourist attraction. Already on Old Compton Street, the tables are full of out-of-town families, just staring. At its eastern end, in Maison Bertaux, a small and paint-chipped French patisserie since 1871, the new Soho is politely scorned. \"It's a bit boring,\" says Michelle Wade, the long-standing owner, between flirting theatrically with her regulars. \"The age range is narrowing. You don't want it turning into Agia Napa, do you?\" She kissed another cheek. \"Although, I, personally, can stay up all night.\"",

      "body": "<p>When Hitler came to power on January 30 1933 it was obvious that anti-Semitism would spread. For years he had made it plain that he hated the Jews and his stormtroopers had beaten them up in public all over Germany. Most Germans realised what would happen when he won power but, in the easy way that people talk about what might happen in politics, even in Germany, people said it wouldn't last;they believed that the old politicians would control him. They soon found out they were wrong.</p> <p> A law for the reconstruction of the civil service was propagated on April 7 - not voted in; government by parliamentary vote had been abolished in March. Reconstruction of the civil service was a euphemism for dismissing Jews from state appointments; that mattered in academic life because nearly all universities were state run.</p> <p> Germany was ahead of all other nations scientifically. It had won a third of the 99 Nobel prizes for science given before 1933 (Britain had won 18, the US six). Hitler expelled 27 scientists who had, or would later win, Nobel prizes. No country could stand that loss. It was years after Hitler's era before Germany began to win Nobel prizes again.</p> <p> Immediately, rescues were organised from London by the Academic Assistance Council (AAC) created specifically to help German academics. Although the Jewish and non-Jewish political opponents of the Nazis were quickly expelled or intimidated, few had had the chance to make any plans before January 30. There was an exception: a Hungarian physicist born in 1898, Leo Szilard. </p> <p>He came from Budapest but like any ambitious scientist - physicists especially - he made for Berlin, the world centre of his subject. It was not easy. There was active anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Germany he felt the threat was even worse. In the years before Hitler achieved power, Szilard taught himself theoretical physics and even got Einstein to teach him statistical mechanics. He was recognised as a genius even by Einstein, Max Planck, Heisenberg, Nernst, Franck and others in Germany. But he always knew that the situation would not last. He was ready to leave at any time and kept his bag packed and beside him.</p> <p> When he left, he bought a first class ticket to Vienna thinking he was less likely to be taken off the train if he was in first class. He started to make contact with intellectuals outside Germany. He went first to Geneva where he found a famous English professor, William Beveridge, in the same hotel.</p> <p> Szilard's idea was to start a university in exile. Beveridge had thought of it, too, but they soon realised that it would be much more effective to bring refugee scientists to British (and other) universities. Beveridge sent Szilard to London, and Szilard needed no more encouragement.</p> <p> By the time Beveridge returned to London, Szilard had been lent two rooms in the Royal Society (the rooms were small but the address was good). The hospitality had been arranged by Lord Rutherford, President of the Royal Society, the man who split the atom and was a leader in the rescue effort. (The great man said in 1933 that the possibility of using atomic energy for industrial or military purposes was mere moonshine.)</p> <p> Szilard's method of working was unusual. Work for him meant thinking. He stayed in the West End at the Strand Palace Hotel (although he had no money) and every day for a month he soaked in a hot bath all morning, thinking.</p> <p> When not thinking about theoretical physics, he was doing all he could to find places for other refugees, who were coming out of Germany in hundreds. Later many went on to the US, but the immediate rescue operation was based in London and led not only by Beveridge and Rutherford but other distinguished academics, such as AV Hill, biological secretary of the Royal Society.</p> <p> He delighted in tormenting the Nazi scientific establishment, which regarded Einstein's theories and even theoretical physics generally, as Jewish physics. Among all these great men was a characteristic English figure: Tess Simpson, a young law graduate and musician who wanted to do good. She worked as assistant to the director of the YMCA in Geneva - pleasant enough but not fulfilling. So when Szilard offered her the job of secretary of the AAC (at a third of her previous salary) she jumped at it. She stayed for the rest of her life. </p> <p>This Yorkshire lass helped the AAC rescue 2,600 refugees, including the world's greatest scientists, finding them jobs, money and resources. They loved her. Long afterwards, at her 90th birthday party, the two men who proposed her health were both members of the Order of Merit, Sir Ernst Gombrich and Max Perutz, Nobel Laureate. </p> <p> Szilard was waiting for the traffic lights to change in Southampton Row, Holborn, when he suddenly was inspired by the idea of atomic fission and the energy it could release. He made a practical mistake about chain reaction, pursuing the bombarding of beryllium, which does not split, rather than uranium, which does. But he knew the dangerous truth that atomic fission was possible; indeed that its discovery was inevitable. All the facts were widely available and there were still brilliant scientists in Germany, Heisenberg among them; they were as capable as the US or the UK of developing an atomic bomb.</p> <p>Szilard could be a pest. He pestered everyone he knew, and he knew them all, to realise what was happening. When atomic fission was discovered, he urged that there should be no publication of the fact. If the Germans knew about it, there might be no way of stopping them making a bomb. Hitler had ways of persuading scientists to obey him. Most American and British colleagues agreed with Szilard about the need for secrecy, but an important paper was nevertheless published in Paris. </p> <p> Szilard played a crucial role in alerting the US government to the possibilities and dangers of atomic fission. He, with fellow-refugees Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, persuaded Albert Einstein to write to President Roosevelt on August 2 1939, warning him of what was happening and suggesting that the US government should start to explore the situation. However, the US did little for two years, until it came into the war on December 7 1941.</p> <p> Luckily, none of this mattered. The process of manufacturing a nuclear bomb, especially the need to purify the uranium isotope 235 (which constitutes less than 1% of unrefined uranium) was much more complicated and difficult than was realised. In the end, even the Americans with their vast resources, space and freedom from bombing, did not finish making a bomb until after the end of the war against Germany.</p> <p> Heisenberg and other German atomic physicists were gathered up at the end of the war in Europe and interned in a house near Cambridge, where their conversations were secretly recorded. They were astonished when they heard the public announcement of the dropping of the first atomic bomb on August 6 1945. Heisenberg refused to believe it for a week and, when he repeated his own calculations, realised that he had made a fundamental mistake. The idea that he and the other German scientists deliberately refrained from giving Hitler an atomic bomb, which he would have had no compunction about using, really is mere moonshine.</p> <p> Among those scientists whom Szilard badgered in the US was the notable Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. He had arrived to work in America very stylishly. In December 1938 he went from Rome to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize, and then, instead of returning to Italy, took a boat to New York. Many of his friends and colleagues were already there and he was made very welcome, as was Niels Bohr, \"the great Dane\", who a few weeks later arrived from Europe with the news that Otto Hahn had achieved fission in Berlin. The effect was electric. All the physicists immediately saw the significance if the event, and some were even said to have left Bohr's lecture before its end to return to their laboratories to confirm the findings. Fermi went to Chicago University, where Szilard joined him.</p> <p> On December 2, 1942 he achieved the first chain reaction . They drank chianti from plastic cups, though hardly in celebration - Szilard said: \"This will go down as a black day in the history of mankind.\" Once a chain reaction - produced in a former squash court under a football stadium in Chicago - had been converted through prodigious effort to the building of a workable atomic bomb, Szilard was against using it, as were nearly all the other physicists involved. They favoured a warning to Japan or a demonstration on an uninhabited island. Many, including Einstein, were horrified that the bomb should be dropped on civilian populations. But it was a political, not a scientific, decision. </p> <p> Szilard was frantic to reach President Truman to persuade him not to use the bomb. So persistent was he that he was even suspected of treachery by General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project that had developed the bomb. Groves petitioned the secretary for war, Henry Stimson, to dismiss or imprison him. He had Szilard tailed by the FBI - they followed him even to the ceremony where he became an American citizen; the agents reported that he \"speaks occasionally in a foreign tongue\". Stimson was too sensible to pay attention to Groves; but Groves did win the battle to stop Szilard from reaching the president. </p> <p> After the war, Szilard worked for the Pugwash conferences of international physicists, trying to keep atomic energy under civilian control. He moved to Washington to promote arms control, including opening up a hotline to the Soviet Union's Nikita Khrushchev. </p> <p> When he was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1959, he directed his own radiation treatment. Even among the remarkable collection of brains who fled Germany - unique in history - Szilard stands out. Perhaps he might have achieved even more if he had been more consistent and persistent. Some of his colleagues thought just that, but he made so many contributions to the good of the world that it is difficult to fault him; he was an eccentric genius. </p> <p> This article is based on the book, Hitler's Gifts, by David Pyke and Jean Medawar, to be published next month by Richard Cohen Books at \u00a320.</p>",

In the end, even the Americans with their vast resources, space and freedom from bombing, did not finish making a bomb until after the end of the war against Germany. Heisenberg and other German atomic physicists were gathered up at the end of the war in Europe and interned in a house near Cambridge, where their conversations were secretly recorded. They were astonished when they heard the public announcement of the dropping of the first atomic bomb on August 6 1945. Heisenberg refused to believe it for a week and, when he repeated his own calculations, realised that he had made a fundamental mistake. The idea that he and the other German scientists deliberately refrained from giving Hitler an atomic bomb, which he would have had no compunction about using, really is mere moonshine. Among those scientists whom Szilard badgered in the US was the notable Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. He had arrived to work in America very stylishly. In December 1938 he went from Rome to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize, and then, instead of returning to Italy, took a boat to New York. Many of his friends and colleagues were already there and he was made very welcome, as was Niels Bohr, \"the great Dane\", who a few weeks later arrived from Europe with the news that Otto Hahn had achieved fission in Berlin. The effect was electric. All the physicists immediately saw the significance if the event, and some were even said to have left Bohr's lecture before its end to return to their laboratories to confirm the findings. Fermi went to Chicago University, where Szilard joined him. On December 2, 1942 he achieved the first chain reaction . They drank chianti from plastic cups, though hardly in celebration - Szilard said: \"This will go down as a black day in the history of mankind.\" Once a chain reaction - produced in a former squash court under a football stadium in Chicago - had been converted through prodigious effort to the building of a workable atomic bomb, Szilard was against using it, as were nearly all the other physicists involved. They favoured a warning to Japan or a demonstration on an uninhabited island. Many, including Einstein, were horrified that the bomb should be dropped on civilian populations. But it was a political, not a scientific, decision. Szilard was frantic to reach President Truman to persuade him not to use the bomb. So persistent was he that he was even suspected of treachery by General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project that had developed the bomb. Groves petitioned the secretary for war, Henry Stimson, to dismiss or imprison him. He had Szilard tailed by the FBI - they followed him even to the ceremony where he became an American citizen; the agents reported that he \"speaks occasionally in a foreign tongue\". Stimson was too sensible to pay attention to Groves; but Groves did win the battle to stop Szilard from reaching the president. After the war, Szilard worked for the Pugwash conferences of international physicists, trying to keep atomic energy under civilian control. He moved to Washington to promote arms control, including opening up a hotline to the Soviet Union's Nikita Khrushchev. When he was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1959, he directed his own radiation treatment. Even among the remarkable collection of brains who fled Germany - unique in history - Szilard stands out. Perhaps he might have achieved even more if he had been more consistent and persistent. Some of his colleagues thought just that, but he made so many contributions to the good of the world that it is difficult to fault him; he was an eccentric genius. This article is based on the book, Hitler's Gifts, by David Pyke and Jean Medawar, to be published next month by Richard Cohen Books at \u00a320.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Manchester City's fans have a song about Roy Keane and, if they are trying to get under his skin, they are going a good way about it. </p> <p> \"Keano . . . 50,000 quid . . . he scored for Real Madrid . . .\" </p> <p>On the face of it Keane could have been excused for spending the summer in a demob-happy cocoon. His curriculum vitae, after all, could be embossed in gold - the captain of Britain's premier club, the double footballer of the year - he won the players award and the football writers' - and a salary, in excess of what can be heard at Maine Road, of \u00a352,000 a week. </p> <p>Keane, however, is not one for luxuriating in his own self-worth. Manchester United may have won the Premiership by a country mile but mention the events of last season to their captain and he shakes his head as though mildly embarrassed. To him the negatives far outweigh the positives. </p> <p>In his mind he was part of a side that relinquished the Champions League all too easily. He has spent much of the summer poring over what went wrong. \"I've thought about it a lot and I'm sure we allowed a touch of complacency to creep in,\" he says. \"People talk about what we did in the Premiership and that it must have been great but, for me, it was definitely an anticlimax. </p> <p>\"There's a lot of talk from the players that we want to be mentioned along with the Milans and Juventuses, getting to the finals every year and winning them. But talk is cheap. You have to do the business in Europe and we didn't last season. Sub-consciously I think one or two too many players thought: 'This will be easier now we've won it once.' We have to make sure we have learned from that this year.\" </p> <p>Complacency is hardly a word associated with Sir Alex Ferguson's teams. But, if Keane sounds overly critical, it is not for effect. Contrary to the popular image, this is a far more complex individual than the one-dimensional tough guy. </p> <p>When reports came out in the tabloids last weekend alleging that he had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and was treated for stress at the Priory Clinic, reports that Ferguson denied, it seemed inconceivable that a player with inner strength oozing from every pore could have succumbed to the demands placed on him. Anyone but Keane, surely? </p> <p>But few people in football can claim to know the inner Keane. When he speaks, people listen. Yet, according to one former team-mate, he is something of a \"mystery\". What is certain is that, like his manager, Keane is a perfectionist. When he recently described his own season as \"mediocre\" it was not false modesty. And, as they prepare to open their season at Wembley tomorrow against Chelsea in the traditional curtain-raiser, he is clearly still punishing himself for that own-goal against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals defeat at Old Trafford. </p> <p>\"I do think about it,\" he says. \"I remind myself of the disappointments to spur me on. It's no good looking at the good moments and forgetting what else happened.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City's fans have a song about Roy Keane and, if they are trying to get under his skin, they are going a good way about it. \"Keano . . . 50,000 quid . . . he scored for Real Madrid . . .\" On the face of it Keane could have been excused for spending the summer in a demob-happy cocoon. His curriculum vitae, after all, could be embossed in gold - the captain of Britain's premier club, the double footballer of the year - he won the players award and the football writers' - and a salary, in excess of what can be heard at Maine Road, of \u00a352,000 a week. Keane, however, is not one for luxuriating in his own self-worth. Manchester United may have won the Premiership by a country mile but mention the events of last season to their captain and he shakes his head as though mildly embarrassed. To him the negatives far outweigh the positives. In his mind he was part of a side that relinquished the Champions League all too easily. He has spent much of the summer poring over what went wrong. \"I've thought about it a lot and I'm sure we allowed a touch of complacency to creep in,\" he says. \"People talk about what we did in the Premiership and that it must have been great but, for me, it was definitely an anticlimax. \"There's a lot of talk from the players that we want to be mentioned along with the Milans and Juventuses, getting to the finals every year and winning them. But talk is cheap. You have to do the business in Europe and we didn't last season. Sub-consciously I think one or two too many players thought: 'This will be easier now we've won it once.' We have to make sure we have learned from that this year.\" Complacency is hardly a word associated with Sir Alex Ferguson's teams. But, if Keane sounds overly critical, it is not for effect. Contrary to the popular image, this is a far more complex individual than the one-dimensional tough guy. When reports came out in the tabloids last weekend alleging that he had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and was treated for stress at the Priory Clinic, reports that Ferguson denied, it seemed inconceivable that a player with inner strength oozing from every pore could have succumbed to the demands placed on him. Anyone but Keane, surely? But few people in football can claim to know the inner Keane. When he speaks, people listen. Yet, according to one former team-mate, he is something of a \"mystery\". What is certain is that, like his manager, Keane is a perfectionist. When he recently described his own season as \"mediocre\" it was not false modesty. And, as they prepare to open their season at Wembley tomorrow against Chelsea in the traditional curtain-raiser, he is clearly still punishing himself for that own-goal against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals defeat at Old Trafford. \"I do think about it,\" he says. \"I remind myself of the disappointments to spur me on. It's no good looking at the good moments and forgetting what else happened. And it's no use thinking that I was voted footballer of the year and being happy with that. \"A lot of top players and teams have a taste of success and seem to stand still, get a bit carried away. Our hunger comes from the manager and it's within certain players. What happened last year is gone. \"In my mind there's definitely room for improvement.

      "body": "<p>In 1986, the last time Wimbledon competed outside the top flight, William Hague was presumably still recovering from his 14 pints a day, a mere tipple for the Crazy Gang of that era. To judge by the mood at the Dons' training ground this week there will be no hangover from last season's traumas when the Nationwide League begins today. </p> <p>For years it was suggested that, if Wimbledon tumbled out of the top division, they might sink as spectacularly as they had shot up. Chief among the doom-mongers were the club themselves. </p> <p>Yet the high-tempo training, the booming dressing-room music and the confident words of Marcus Gayle spoke not only of a new beginning but of a return to old values under Terry Burton after the Egil Olsen interlude. Crowds will be down but optimism is up as Tranmere visit this afternoon. </p> <p>\"I expect us to be challenging for the automatic places,\" Gayle says. \"This year we are all on the same wavelength, all on the same page. Last year there were quite a few problems with the players and the management. </p> <p>\"Terry and his backroom staff have united everyone and everybody knows in no uncertain terms what they need to do. I think we are in a much better position mentally than we were last year.\" </p> <p>And much better tactically, too. The passing and movement overseen by the coach Stewart Robson hinted that Wimbledon fans will spend far less time craning their necks towards the floodlights. </p> <p>Gayle welcomes the more attractive approach, claiming Olsen made the team too predictable. \"It was a bit stifling,\" he says, \"because everyone knew how to play against us. We only had one way of play.\" </p> <p>Many wonder, though, whether style will bring success after the close-season departures of Neil Sullivan, Ben Thatcher and Carl Cort. But an unbeaten pre-season has restored battered confidence and Gayle believes the squad - strengthened yesterday when Michael Thomas signed a two-year contract - contains more than adequate replacements.

      "bodyText": "In 1986, the last time Wimbledon competed outside the top flight, William Hague was presumably still recovering from his 14 pints a day, a mere tipple for the Crazy Gang of that era. To judge by the mood at the Dons' training ground this week there will be no hangover from last season's traumas when the Nationwide League begins today. For years it was suggested that, if Wimbledon tumbled out of the top division, they might sink as spectacularly as they had shot up. Chief among the doom-mongers were the club themselves. Yet the high-tempo training, the booming dressing-room music and the confident words of Marcus Gayle spoke not only of a new beginning but of a return to old values under Terry Burton after the Egil Olsen interlude. Crowds will be down but optimism is up as Tranmere visit this afternoon. \"I expect us to be challenging for the automatic places,\" Gayle says. \"This year we are all on the same wavelength, all on the same page. Last year there were quite a few problems with the players and the management. \"Terry and his backroom staff have united everyone and everybody knows in no uncertain terms what they need to do. I think we are in a much better position mentally than we were last year.\" And much better tactically, too. The passing and movement overseen by the coach Stewart Robson hinted that Wimbledon fans will spend far less time craning their necks towards the floodlights. Gayle welcomes the more attractive approach, claiming Olsen made the team too predictable. \"It was a bit stifling,\" he says, \"because everyone knew how to play against us. We only had one way of play.\" Many wonder, though, whether style will bring success after the close-season departures of Neil Sullivan, Ben Thatcher and Carl Cort. But an unbeaten pre-season has restored battered confidence and Gayle believes the squad - strengthened yesterday when Michael Thomas signed a two-year contract - contains more than adequate replacements. In the 19-year-old Patrick Agyemang, he sees a better player than Cort. \"He has tricks like Ronaldo, he excites people and he can finish,\" Gayle says of the homegrown talent, who is expected to start today with John Hartson suspended. \"He'll play better than Carl, no disrespect to Carl. He's got more tricks.\" Five experienced Wimbledon players, including Kenny Cunningham and Michael Hughes, are injured. But the biggest worry for Gayle, a former Brentford player, is how his team-mates without lower-division experience will adjust to their new surroundings. \"I consider the Premiership the Hollywood of football,\" he says. \"The Nationwide is like the real world. We are going to get in some serious challenges. Referees may let things go and mentally we are going to have to ride a lot more tackles.\" Such passion seems certain at Bolton - who yesterday took the Bradford City striker Isiah Rankin on a three-month loan - where Wanderers take on their promoted rivals Burnley.
