Cricket's more protracted rhythms had encouraged a camaraderie between both men, and when Aston Villa once conceded a penalty against Carlisle at Brunton Park, Cumbes, the Villa goalkeeper, used it to his advantage. </p> <p>\"I remember telling Baldy that he'd no chance and that I'd whack the ball away with my bat. He just smiled, ran up and blazed it against the crossbar.\" </p> <p>Cumbes eventually made amends, however, as his shut-out for Villa against Orient at the end of the 1973-4 season ensured that Carlisle gained promotion. </p> <p>\"Half the Carlisle side, including Baldy, were at the game,\" Cumbes recalled. \"He deserved to experience a bit of First Division life. He had a wonderful left foot, not particularly tenacious but a great passer of the ball. In fact, he was more cultured as a footballer than a cricketer. </p> <p>\"And what a nice guy, so unassuming. The one thing you knew about his umpiring was that he had made an honest decision.\" </p> <p>James Whitaker, Leicestershire's manager, added: \"He was one of life's gentlemen and so professional in his outlook.\" </p> <p>The majority of Balderstone the footballer's 524 league games, in a career stretching between 1959 and 1975, were for Carlisle.

Then Wiltord puts in a dangerous cross but there is no one to meet it at the far post. 3 Ziani has a shot blocked for a corner from which Saveljic tests Van der Gouw wth a header. 6 Saveljic catches Batlles with his knee and the midfielder goes off on a stretcher with blood streaming from his nose. 9 GOAL Bordeaux 1 Man Utd 0 A howler from Van Der Gouw as he fluffs a soft left-foot shot from Pavon. 12 Bordeaux swarm at United but Stam puts in a good headed clearance and then the home side are caught offside. 13 Bordeaux substitution: Diabate for Batlles. 16 Wiltford left-foot shot from the edge of the box on the turn fizzes past United's right-hand upright. 19 Wiltford plays Laslandes into the area but his right-foot shot is smothered by Van der Gouw. 21 At the other end Cole wins a corner and from Beckham's delivery Sheringham sends a firece header just over from 10 yards. 23 Red card Laslandes is booked needlessly for dissent and then foolishly lunges at Beckham studs up and immediately receives a second yellow card.

It's Keane's 11th goal of the season. 38 With their extra-man advantage, it's all United now. 43 Stam brings down Micoud and is booked for showing dissent.

Half-time: Bordeaux 1 Manchester United 1 47 Cole is put clear and a goals eems certain but just as he is about to shoot Afanou denies him with a superbly timed challenge to concede a corner. 49 Beckham, now relentlessly booed and whistled by the home crowd, curls a gentle shot into the arms of Rame. 51 Micoud takes on Silvestre and hammers United's right-hand post. Wiltord's follow-up effort flashes across goal but wide. 52 Giggs streaks down the left and his shot is deflected for a corner by Rame. 55 From a short-corner routine Beckham whips in a cross from the left which Keane meets with a glancing header that shaves the far post. 58 It's an end-to-end match now and Micoud drives narrowly wide from 25 yards. 59 Irwin crosses from deep on the left and Cole heads wide from seven yards. 60 Bordeaux substitution: Rouviere for Ziani. 61 Bonissel breaks down the left and puts in a superb cross but Wiltord cannott control his header from 10 yards. 64 Rouviere's excellent pass sets Wiltord free on the right and the striker cuts inside to test Van der Gouw with a low left-foot drive. 70 Grenet is booked for pulling Giggs's shirt. Beckham fires his free-kick into the wall. 74 Beckham sends in a dangerous cross from the right but Irwin, at full stretch, can only turn the ball over. 77 Man Utd substitution: Yorke for Sheringham. 80 Micoud picks out Wiltord on the left who leaves Stam for dead cutting inside and his low right-foot drive is turned round by Van der Gouw. 82 Bordeaux substitution: Feindouno for Wiltord. 82 With his first touch Feindouno has a chance for glory but Van der Gouw blocks his close range effort. 83 Man Utd substitution: Solskjaer for Irwin. 84 GOAL Bordeaux 1-2 Man Utd Barely on the pitch Solskjaer again grabs the late glory as he beats a couple of players on the edge of the area and slots the ball past Rame. 86 Man Utd substitution: Berg for Cole. 90 United mess about at a corner and Giggs is booked.

He described Spurs' decision as \"potty\" and warned that Hartson would head elsewhere before long. </p> <p>\"It was just a routine medical and Tottenham were not happy with it,\" Barnett said. \"It's related to the cartilage operation he had over Christmas. </p> <p>\"John is very upset but I think he will prove them wrong.

This is not the end for John. </p> <p>\"It's Tottenham's loss and it's not the first player they'll have made a mistake about. With all the problems they have had [with injured players] I think they've gone overboard.

      "bodyText": "John Hartson's \"dream move\" from Wimbledon to Tottenham turned into a nightmare yesterday when Spurs pulled out of the \u00a36m deal after the striker failed a medical on his left knee. While Sam Hammam gleefully declared that \"God must be on the side of Wimbledon\", Hartson's agent, Jonathan Barnett, failed to see the divine hand at work. He described Spurs' decision as \"potty\" and warned that Hartson would head elsewhere before long. \"It was just a routine medical and Tottenham were not happy with it,\" Barnett said. \"It's related to the cartilage operation he had over Christmas. \"John is very upset but I think he will prove them wrong. He'll score a lot more goals for Wimbledon and maybe then for another club. This is not the end for John. \"It's Tottenham's loss and it's not the first player they'll have made a mistake about. With all the problems they have had [with injured players] I think they've gone overboard. They've gone potty.\" Spurs' announcement that they would not \"proceed at this moment\" hinted at a possible return for the player.

      "bodyText": "Freeserve, Britain's largest internet service provider, and AOL UK, its nearest rival, are understood to be working on plans to match AltaVista's commitment to offer unlimited access to the web in return for an upfront fee. Analysts believe that the heavyweight duo could have their offerings in place by the time AltaVista's package is expected to go live in June, heralding a war of attrition between the leading internet service providers and cheaper net access for consumers. AltaVista said yesterday that it will connect people to the net via a freephone number for a one-off joining fee of \u00a330 to \u00a350 and an annual renewal charge of \u00a310 to \u00a320. It hopes 1m customers will sign up for the service within a year, citing the cost of calls as one of the biggest obstacles to people connecting the the internet. Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Bradshaw said the dominant operators were unlikely to let their positions be eroded. \"The other free ISPs are likely to come out with similar or improved packages within the next few weeks,\" he said. Miles Saltiel, technology analyst at West LB Panmure, echoed his sentiments. \"It puts all the big ISPs on their mettle,\" he said. \"Those with the deepest pockets will win.\" Freeserve admitted that it was working on its own low-cost packages and ways of reducing its 4p per minute call charges. \"We have always said that connectivity will become a less significant contributor to revenues,\" a spokesman said. \"We welcome any moves that get more people in the UK online.\" Its shares closed down 47p at 873p, however. Oftel, the telecommunica tions watchdog which has asked internet service providers to lower subscription costs and call charges in an attempt to encourage more people online, said the news was \"excellent\". Tony Blair, who has called on British Telecommunications to lower the cost of its internet call charges and help prevent the web from becoming the preserve of the wealthy, also welcomed the move. BT is committed to launch unmetered access but is still negotiating terms with the regulator and other ISPs. Around one quarter of the British population is online but in the US, where local calls are free, the figure is closer to one half. Durlacher analyst Nick Gibson believes unmetered internet access could treble the amount of time British users spend online. Mr Bradshaw said AltaVista's move signalled the death of access-only internet service providers and switched the focus towards the content, community and commerce. \"It's all in the portal now and not the connectivity,\" he said. However details of the AltaVista package remain sketchy. Rivals suggest that users who sign up are likely to be heavily targeted by advertisers. MCI Worldcom has been rumoured to be the company's chosen telecommunications provider, but AltaVista's European marketing director, Vesey Crichton, refused to confirm or deny whether a partner had yet been found. Advertising and e-commerce revenues will offset the cost of subsidising calls, Mr Crichton said. Subscribers will be limited to 500,000 so AltaVista can cope with demand. The managing director of one of Britain's largest ISPs estimated that if AltaVista customers follow the pattern of US users and spend an average of 15 hours a month online, and the company attracts its targeted 1m users, the exercise will cost upwards of \u00a350m in call charges alone in year one. \"They're going to subsidise the hell out of this,\" he said. AltaVista has attracted 2m users in the US since launching the same model there. However, AOL UK's Matt Peacock questioned whether advertising and e-commerce revenues were enough to sustain AltaVista's model.",

      "bodyText": "Alun Michael, the former Welsh secretary and home office minister, is to resign his seat in the Welsh assembly and stay on as an MP in a bid to pick up the threads of his Westminister political career. His decision, announced in Cardiff yesterday, comes just five weeks after his dramatic resignation as Labour leader in Wales and will make him the first assembly member to stand down since devolution less than a year ago. Under assembly rules Mr Michael's departure will not trigger a byelection. He was elected under the proportional representation system used to choose top-up candidates from regional party lists and will be replaced by the second name on Labour's list for mid and west Wales, Delyth Evans, a former BBC and HTV journalist. Ms Evans worked on the BBC's World at One and PM programmes before becoming a policy adviser and speechwriter to the former Labour leader John Smith. She will take her seat in the assembly from May 1. Mr Michael, who has represented Cardiff South and Penarth since 1987, has been considering his political future since resigning as first secretary of the national assembly during a no confidence debate on Labour's handling of European funding for Wales last month. The general committee of his constituency party have been urging him to stay on as their MP and Mr Michael consulted widely with family, friends and party workers before deciding to return to Westminster. The decision marks the end of an often turbulent chapter in his political career after being pressed by Downing Street to take on the job following the downfall of the former Welsh secretary Ron Davies. Mr Michael said yesterday that he remained a passionate advocate of devolution and that he was leaving the assembly without bitterness. He added that while he could make a continuing contribution in the assembly there was always a danger that a former leader could become \"an irritation and a negative force\". Rhodri Morgan, who took over as first secretary following Mr Michael's resignation last month, said: \"Alun has done an enormous amount to getting the assembly up and running, very often working under great pressure.\"",

The \"blatant ballot-rigging\" that gave Mr Dobson the Labour nomination, while winning an estimated 22,275 votes to Mr Livingstone's 74,646, and the \"massive support among Londoners that I should stand\" had been decisive, despite earlier undertakings not to stand against Labour's official candidate. Emphasising the \"broad church\", cross-party appeal he planned for his campaign, Mr Livingstone said he would be highlighting his demand for the Tube to stay in public hands. Londoners would have to weigh his broken undertakings against the way Labour had conducted its mayoral selection and \"choose which is the greatest crime\". His opponents predicted that his support had peaked, before last night's Guardian poll, and Mr Livingstone's campaign organisers said a fall in Mr Livingstone's opinion poll support from the 51% level in last month's ICM poll for the Evening Standard had been built into their calculations. At the launch of his own campaign, overshadowed by Mr Livingstone's announcement, Mr Dobson sought to isolate Mr Livingstone on the left, accusing him of being \"soft on crime\", \"anti-police\" and \"anti-business\", with \"ruinous policies\" and \"chat-show politics\" that would saddle Londoners with debt and higher taxes. Mr Livingstone countered that he had been \"consistent in his support for the police\" and said he would fight to reverse the cuts in spending on the Metropolitan police by both Labour and Tory government's and to increase the force from 26,000 to 28,000. \u0095ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,003 adults aged over 18 by telephone yesterday. Interviews were conducted across London and the data has been weighted to the profile of all London adults.",

      "byline": "Nick Davies",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Bonanza</strong><br> </p> <p>In 1992, according to the Commons library, there were only two LEAs in England which were not spending above the SSA guideline. By the time Mr Blunkett took office, there were 30 who had been forced below the SSA level. Behind the annual announcements of increases in SSA, the amount which the LEAs actually spent on education was falling. In 1992/93, LEAs were spending \u00a325.6bn. Adjusted to 1992 prices, the figure fell sharply in the next year, to \u00a321.8bn. This was partly because further education was taken out of LEA control, but it was also part of a real funding fall which continued in every single subsequent year. </p> <p>In 1994/95, LEA spending dropped to \u00a321.2bn, then to \u00a320.6bn, then to \u00a320.3bn. And all this time, pupil numbers were rising. By the time Mr Blunkett announced his spending bonanza, his department's figures showed that, in 1992 prices, the LEAs were spending only \u00a319.9bn; and, whereas they had once been spending \u00a32.9bn more than the SSA, they were now spending only \u00a31.1bn more than the Whitehall guideline. If Mr Blunkett wanted to avoid further cuts in LEA spending, he had to build any rise on top of the real level of spending, not on top of Whitehall's notional guideline. He chose not to. </p> <p>On the face of it, he was steering the LEAs into disaster. If the extra cash he was giving them really amounted to only \u00a3800m for the first year, then all of this increase and more was going to be swallowed by this hungover annual debt. The reality is that LEAs have carried on clawing in extra money - but some of them also have carried on cutting. This year there are now 53 out of the 150 LEAs in England who are spending less than the SSA guideline on their schools. </p> <p>It turns out that this lingering debt is only the first of a list of unacknowledged costs which will soak up Mr Blunkett's limited extra cash. This was spelled out to Mr Blunkett's department at the end of last year when LEAs in England and Wales submitted a report in which they explained in black and white that they did not have enough cash for the coming financial year, 2000/01. Mr Blunkett was suggesting (as part of his \u00a33.6bn increase in SSA over three years) that they spend an extra \u00a31.211bn for the year and that this would allow them to raise standards, but the LEAs complained that - even supposing they had enough cash to fund this increase in SSA - it would not allow them even to cover debts and unavoidable changes in their basic costs. </p> <p>To close the remaining gap between SSA guidelines and real spending, the report said, they would need \u00a3388m; plus \u00a3250m for ordinary price inflation; \u00a3140m for an increase in pupil numbers; \u00a320m for an increase in children with special needs; \u00a3125m for an increase in employer contributions for teacher pensions; and \u00a3150m for Mr Blunkett's new pay incentives for the best teachers. That long list left them with an increase of only \u00a3138m for the year. And they had still allowed nothing for the annual teacher's pay rise (costed by Mr Blunkett at nearly \u00a3400m); and nothing to fund any improvement in standards. Right in the middle of Mr Blunkett's widely advertised three-year bonanza, the education authorities were heading for the red. </p> <p>This was a nasty political problem for Mr Blunkett. One official described the atmosphere in the department simply as \"panic\". And so it was that Mr Blunkett wrote to MPs on November 26 last year to announce an increase of \u00a364m in grant and a \u00a390m delay in school contributions to teacher pensions. This was a radical shift in plans - an emergency move. \"It was a complete surprise,\" said Neil Fletcher, head of education at the Local Government Association, \"although we were glad they admitted that their figures were wrong.\" </p> <p>There is no torrent of cash flooding through the mainstream of education; essentially, the same old drought continues. In Buckinghamshire, for example, the local authority last year surveyed the state of local schools and found they would need a 13% real increase, but Mr Blunkett's three-year increase gave them scarcely enough to allow school budgets to match rising costs. Looking at their buildings, they found they needed \u00a36m a year for repairs; they could afford only \u00a32m; and the backlog of building work had reached \u00a321m. Any plan to meet the needs of their schools, the council concluded, was \"unlikely to be achievable\". </p> <p>Some local authorities are claiming that, allowing for rising costs, there is simply no real new money for them at all. The system is constructed so as to make it impossible finally to prove or disprove the claim. The funding of local government is notoriously complex and produces irrational discrepancies between similar areas and so it may be that some LEAs will receive real, new cash from Whitehall but it is clear that the \u00a33.6bn boost which Mr Blunkett advertised is a political mirage. </p> <p>There remains one final category - \u00a33.3bn of direct spending by the DfEE. Here, at last, there is real additional money, unclouded by hyperbole or conjuring. Here, at last, there is some ground for Mr Blunkett to congratulate himself. And yet, even here, the story is not quite the one that he likes to tell. </p> <p>Part of this direct spending does not go on education at all. It pays for Ofsted and for the department's running costs. Local authorities have complained that while the department canes them for spending no more than 3% of their budget on central costs, the department spends nearly 7% of its own budget on its own administration, a trend which it has appeared reluctant to admit. For example, when Phil Willis asked how much of the budget for education action zones (EAZs) had been spent on administration, he was told the answer was \u00a3500,000. When he asked a few weeks later how much of the budget for EAZs had been spent on a specific list of administrative activities, he was told the answer was \u00a31.14m - nearly 10% of the entire EAZ budget. Mr Willis went on to discover that the DfEE's spending on consultants has soared by more than \u00a32m during the current year. </p> <p> <strong> Targeted</strong><br> </p> <p> The element of spending which does represent a real increase in spending is targeted grants - the sure start scheme for pre-schoolers, the programme to reduce class sizes, EAZs and, most important, the standards fund (SF), a rapidly expanding collection of cash which is parcelled out by the department on some of Mr Blunkett's most high-profile projects such as the literacy and numeracy schemes, the training of \"superheads\" and the programme to reduce truancy. </p> <p>This year's standards fund is worth about \u00a3700m, an increase of \u00a3300m over last year. Next year, it is due to rise by a further \u00a3400m, with a comparable rise expected in the final year of the Parliament. During the three years of Mr Blunkett's bonanza, it will have risen by about \u00a31bn. This money is real, it is new, but there are two problems with the way in which Mr Blunkett has administered the grants. </p> <p>The first is that this system of grants not only bypasses the school budgets which are the core of education, but actually steals money away from them. This is because for almost every pound LEAs accept from standards fund, they have to match it with up to 60p from elsewhere. This year, they are expected to pay out \u00a3400m in matching funds. Next year, as the fund rises, they face a bill of \u00a3600m. Almost all of the LEAs who replied to our survey reported that they were struggling as a result. Brent has decided to turn down grants in order to protect its schools' budgets; Cheshire has already cut its school budgets by 5% to pay for SF grants; Derbyshire has had to divert \u00a31.8m from its school budgets; Stockport has had to cut its central services by \u00a3360,000. </p> <p>The second problem is that this money is failing to reach the most needy schools. The department has consistently claimed that it wants to provide, in the words of Estelle Morris, \"targeted support for the areas of poverty\". Although there are one or two programmes which are focused on deprived areas, most SF grants are distributed on a simple formula which takes no account of deprivation and the rest, as well as grants for some repairs, are distributed on a bidding system. Indeed, the former Liberal Democrat education spokesman, Don Foster, found the richer authorities tended to do better, apparently because they had more staff and resources to prepare their bids. </p> <p>His research also revealed that schools and LEAs were wasting considerable time and money in unsuccessful bids. During Mr Blunkett's first two years, there were 25,353 bids but only 8,972 were successful. Oxfordshire made 1,015 bids and saw 1,002 of them fail. Blackpool put in 212 bids and succeeded with only 10. </p> <p>The torrent of new money turns out to be little more than a trickle, with new cash soaked up so fast that it scarcely leaves its mark. You can see it in one of Mr Blunkett's proudest achievements, the highly successful scheme to cut the size of classes for infants, aged five to seven. By 1999, the prime minister was pointing to impressive results with 100,000 more infants in classes of under 30. What Tony Blair did not say was that children in every other age bracket - nursery, junior and secondary - were all being taught in classes that were even more overcrowded than when Labour came to power. Last year's figures showed the number of children in classes of more than 40 had doubled since Mr Blunkett took over; the number in secondary classes of more than 30 was the worst for 14 years; secondary classes generally were more overcrowded than they had been for 20 years. </p> <p>And this trickle of new money over the last three years of the parliament is flowing into a system which was made marginally worse during Mr Blunkett's first two years. Despite Labour's promises, his department's share of government spending actually fell during these two years, from 11.8% to 11.7%. Ten years earlier, when Kenneth Baker was running the department, he had put 12.3% of government spending into education. By the end of Mr Blunkett's first year, spending per secondary pupil, in real terms, had fallen from \u00a32,550 in 1992 to only \u00a32,380. During his second year, spending in real terms was frozen while pupil numbers rose with the result that spending per secondary pupil fell to its lowest since 1989. </p> <p>The reality is that while Mr Blunkett is entitled to point to his increase in SF and other grants as a real bounty for British education, almost all of the rest of his \u00a319bn is an illusion, and the grants alone have not begun to reverse the historic underfunding of Britain's schools. The idea that his original announcement of the bonanza was an historic day which would \"give everyone in our society the opportunity to realise their full potential\" was just another flourish with the magic wand.</p> <p>Additional research by Helene Mulholland</p>",

To close the remaining gap between SSA guidelines and real spending, the report said, they would need \u00a3388m; plus \u00a3250m for ordinary price inflation; \u00a3140m for an increase in pupil numbers; \u00a320m for an increase in children with special needs; \u00a3125m for an increase in employer contributions for teacher pensions; and \u00a3150m for Mr Blunkett's new pay incentives for the best teachers. That long list left them with an increase of only \u00a3138m for the year. And they had still allowed nothing for the annual teacher's pay rise (costed by Mr Blunkett at nearly \u00a3400m); and nothing to fund any improvement in standards. Right in the middle of Mr Blunkett's widely advertised three-year bonanza, the education authorities were heading for the red. This was a nasty political problem for Mr Blunkett. One official described the atmosphere in the department simply as \"panic\". And so it was that Mr Blunkett wrote to MPs on November 26 last year to announce an increase of \u00a364m in grant and a \u00a390m delay in school contributions to teacher pensions. This was a radical shift in plans - an emergency move. \"It was a complete surprise,\" said Neil Fletcher, head of education at the Local Government Association, \"although we were glad they admitted that their figures were wrong.\" There is no torrent of cash flooding through the mainstream of education; essentially, the same old drought continues. In Buckinghamshire, for example, the local authority last year surveyed the state of local schools and found they would need a 13% real increase, but Mr Blunkett's three-year increase gave them scarcely enough to allow school budgets to match rising costs. Looking at their buildings, they found they needed \u00a36m a year for repairs; they could afford only \u00a32m; and the backlog of building work had reached \u00a321m. Any plan to meet the needs of their schools, the council concluded, was \"unlikely to be achievable\". Some local authorities are claiming that, allowing for rising costs, there is simply no real new money for them at all. The system is constructed so as to make it impossible finally to prove or disprove the claim. The funding of local government is notoriously complex and produces irrational discrepancies between similar areas and so it may be that some LEAs will receive real, new cash from Whitehall but it is clear that the \u00a33.6bn boost which Mr Blunkett advertised is a political mirage. There remains one final category - \u00a33.3bn of direct spending by the DfEE. Here, at last, there is real additional money, unclouded by hyperbole or conjuring. Here, at last, there is some ground for Mr Blunkett to congratulate himself. And yet, even here, the story is not quite the one that he likes to tell. Part of this direct spending does not go on education at all. It pays for Ofsted and for the department's running costs. Local authorities have complained that while the department canes them for spending no more than 3% of their budget on central costs, the department spends nearly 7% of its own budget on its own administration, a trend which it has appeared reluctant to admit. For example, when Phil Willis asked how much of the budget for education action zones (EAZs) had been spent on administration, he was told the answer was \u00a3500,000. When he asked a few weeks later how much of the budget for EAZs had been spent on a specific list of administrative activities, he was told the answer was \u00a31.14m - nearly 10% of the entire EAZ budget. Mr Willis went on to discover that the DfEE's spending on consultants has soared by more than \u00a32m during the current year. Targeted The element of spending which does represent a real increase in spending is targeted grants - the sure start scheme for pre-schoolers, the programme to reduce class sizes, EAZs and, most important, the standards fund (SF), a rapidly expanding collection of cash which is parcelled out by the department on some of Mr Blunkett's most high-profile projects such as the literacy and numeracy schemes, the training of \"superheads\" and the programme to reduce truancy. This year's standards fund is worth about \u00a3700m, an increase of \u00a3300m over last year. Next year, it is due to rise by a further \u00a3400m, with a comparable rise expected in the final year of the Parliament. During the three years of Mr Blunkett's bonanza, it will have risen by about \u00a31bn. This money is real, it is new, but there are two problems with the way in which Mr Blunkett has administered the grants. The first is that this system of grants not only bypasses the school budgets which are the core of education, but actually steals money away from them. This is because for almost every pound LEAs accept from standards fund, they have to match it with up to 60p from elsewhere. This year, they are expected to pay out \u00a3400m in matching funds. Next year, as the fund rises, they face a bill of \u00a3600m. Almost all of the LEAs who replied to our survey reported that they were struggling as a result. Brent has decided to turn down grants in order to protect its schools' budgets; Cheshire has already cut its school budgets by 5% to pay for SF grants; Derbyshire has had to divert \u00a31.8m from its school budgets; Stockport has had to cut its central services by \u00a3360,000. The second problem is that this money is failing to reach the most needy schools. The department has consistently claimed that it wants to provide, in the words of Estelle Morris, \"targeted support for the areas of poverty\". Although there are one or two programmes which are focused on deprived areas, most SF grants are distributed on a simple formula which takes no account of deprivation and the rest, as well as grants for some repairs, are distributed on a bidding system. Indeed, the former Liberal Democrat education spokesman, Don Foster, found the richer authorities tended to do better, apparently because they had more staff and resources to prepare their bids. His research also revealed that schools and LEAs were wasting considerable time and money in unsuccessful bids. During Mr Blunkett's first two years, there were 25,353 bids but only 8,972 were successful. Oxfordshire made 1,015 bids and saw 1,002 of them fail. Blackpool put in 212 bids and succeeded with only 10. The torrent of new money turns out to be little more than a trickle, with new cash soaked up so fast that it scarcely leaves its mark. You can see it in one of Mr Blunkett's proudest achievements, the highly successful scheme to cut the size of classes for infants, aged five to seven. By 1999, the prime minister was pointing to impressive results with 100,000 more infants in classes of under 30. What Tony Blair did not say was that children in every other age bracket - nursery, junior and secondary - were all being taught in classes that were even more overcrowded than when Labour came to power. Last year's figures showed the number of children in classes of more than 40 had doubled since Mr Blunkett took over; the number in secondary classes of more than 30 was the worst for 14 years; secondary classes generally were more overcrowded than they had been for 20 years. And this trickle of new money over the last three years of the parliament is flowing into a system which was made marginally worse during Mr Blunkett's first two years. Despite Labour's promises, his department's share of government spending actually fell during these two years, from 11.8% to 11.7%. Ten years earlier, when Kenneth Baker was running the department, he had put 12.3% of government spending into education. By the end of Mr Blunkett's first year, spending per secondary pupil, in real terms, had fallen from \u00a32,550 in 1992 to only \u00a32,380. During his second year, spending in real terms was frozen while pupil numbers rose with the result that spending per secondary pupil fell to its lowest since 1989. The reality is that while Mr Blunkett is entitled to point to his increase in SF and other grants as a real bounty for British education, almost all of the rest of his \u00a319bn is an illusion, and the grants alone have not begun to reverse the historic underfunding of Britain's schools. The idea that his original announcement of the bonanza was an historic day which would \"give everyone in our society the opportunity to realise their full potential\" was just another flourish with the magic wand.

      "body": "<p>There are many mysteries in David Blunkett's department for education, but the greatest of them all is this: where has all the money gone? </p> <p>Just over 18 months ago, on July 14 1998, Mr Blunkett announced a spending bonanza for schools. \"The government is providing an additional \u00a319bn for education over the three years from 1999 to 2002,\" he said. This was a very great deal of extra money; the budget for the entire educational establishment in the whole of the UK in 1998 was only \u00a338.3bn. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett declared that this was \"an historic day for education and for the country\" and \"the fulfilment of our pledge that education would be our number one priority\". These resources, he explained, would transform standards in the education service, boost literacy and numeracy for those under eleven, cut truancy and exclusion by a third, and give half a million more people access to higher and further education. More than that, he went on to pledge that this extra \u00a319bn would \"give everyone in our society the opportunity to realise their full potential\". </p> <p>Mr Blunkett has since pointed repeatedly to this extra \u00a319bn as the touchstone of Labour's commitment to Britain's schools. When he wrote for the Guardian in reply to the first part of this series, he said: \"Of course, our education policy is backed by substantial extra resources. The extra \u00a319bn over three years is real.\" </p> <p>Eighteen months after the announcement, there is little sign of this torrent of extra resources sweeping through our schools and colleges. On the contrary, we have found that the education budget is so tight that three months ago, Mr Blunkett's officials were forced to make emergency changes to keep local education authorities in the black. And when we conducted our own survey of local authorities, all but one of them reported that they had schools whose budgets were locked into deficit. Leeds, for example, said that 68 of its 299 schools are in deficit; Somerset has 32 schools in the red; Northumbria has 34; Staffordshire has 29; Rotherham has 39. </p> <p>So where is the \u00a319bn? Maybe it is already in the schools and we have simply failed to observe it. Maybe it is on its way down the pipeline and will arrive any week now. Or maybe it never existed. Maybe the truth is that Mr Blunkett's \u00a319bn is largely composed of magical money, literally billions of pounds which have been conjured out of thin air by trickery - double-counting, treble-counting, several different book-keeping manoeuvres and a steady stream of fundamentally misleading public statements. Watch closely and you can see the conjuror at work. The first trick is the biggest. </p> <p>Ever since the birth of inflation, government departments have been increasing their spending each year. When Mr Blunkett made his grand announcement in July 1998, he was reporting the results for education of chancellor Gordon Brown's comprehensive spending review, which had laid down a budget for every Whitehall department for each of the final three years of the parliament. The existing budget for UK education, for 1998/9, was \u00a338.3bn. As a result of the review, Mr Blunkett was able to announce that this would rise, in 1999, by \u00a33bn; in 2000, by \u00a33.5bn; and finally, in 2001/2, by \u00a33.2bn. That was all he announced. But, of course that adds up to only \u00a39.7bn. Where was the rest of the \u00a319bn? The answer is that it does not exist. Contrary to Mr Blunkett's description of his \u00a319bn as \"real\", nearly half of it is manufactured by a single book-keeping trick. </p> <p><strong> Confusing </strong><br> </p> <p> It works like this. You take the increase for the first year and you say \"Well, if I pay this in the first year, it will become a permanent part of the budget, so I will still be paying it in subsequent years when I make further annual increases, so I should carry on counting it as an increase each year.\" This is not the way that any British government has previously accounted for its budgets. Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies says it is \"misleading\"; David Heald, professor of accountancy at Aberdeen university and adviser to the treasury select committee, says it is \"confusing\" and \"unprecedented\". </p> <p>But, for Mr Blunkett, the result was simply excellent. In year one, he had a rise of \u00a33bn. In year two, he had a rise of \u00a33.5bn but he added in the \u00a33bn which he would still be paying from year one and called it a rise of \u00a36.5bn. Then he came to year three, when he had a rise of \u00a33.2bn, but he added in the \u00a36.5bn which he had already committed to the budget in the first two years and called it a rise of \u00a39.7bn. Then he stood back and added the whole lot up - \u00a33bn plus \u00a36.5bn plus \u00a39.7bn. A \u00a319.2bn bonanza. </p> <p>In principle, there is nothing to stop the government pursuing this creative arithmetic for every subsequent year. For 2002, for example, Mr Blunkett might announce the lowest increase in education spending for years - say, a meagre \u00a32bn. But, by then he would be able to count his 1999 money four times, his 2000 money three times, his 2001 money twice. And so his meagre \u00a32bn would become a super soaraway rise of \u00a330.9bn. If he is still running education at the end of a second Labour parliament, Mr Blunkett will be able to announce annual rises which will wipe out the debt of whole continents. </p> <p>This analysis cannot be news to Mr Blunkett or, indeed, to Mr Brown, whose officials dreamed it up. The wizardry was spotted within two weeks of the original announcement by no less a source than the treasury select committee. This committee of MPs interviewed all of the key people who had been involved in delivering the spending review; they also took advice from three independent experts in public finance. Despite the fact that this committee is dominated by Labour MPs, they filed a highly critical report, dated July 27 1998. </p> <p>In the report - which received virtually no public attention at all - the MPs took one look at Mr Blunkett's \u00a319bn and saw straight through the figures. They came to two conclusions about this and about a comparable stunt with the health budget. First, in the most courteous terms, they told the government to stop playing with the numbers: \"We recommend that, for the sake of transparency, in future the government should refer to annual increases over the previous year, rather than a cumulative total.\" Second, they noted how the media had \"faithfully reproduced\" the misleading numbers. </p> <p>The truth is that for his first two years in power, Mr Blunkett actually invested less in education than the Tories had been and, by the end of this parliament, he will still be only marginally ahead of the Tory level of spending - a level which he used to describe as \"miserable\". This was uncovered by researchers in the Commons library who reviewed education funding during the years of Tory rule from 1979 to 1997, and worked out the average annual rise. </p> <p>They projected that forward for the five years of this parliament and compared the result with Mr Blunkett's budgets (even though, as we shall see, these figures are themselves questionable). They found that in his first year, (looking at England alone) Mr Blunkett spent \u00a3324m less than the projected Tory level. In his second year, he undershot them again, by \u00a3323m. In the current year, 1999/00, Labour has finally begun to nudge ahead of Tory spending levels, with an increase of \u00a3770m; but even in the fifth year, with the maximum effect of their new budget, Labour will still be spending only \u00a33bn a year more on education in England than the Tories would have done if they had stayed in office - \u00a338.8bn compared to the \u00a335.8bn projected for the Tories. The additional \u00a319bn is nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>One of the few MPs who has woken up to what has been happening is Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on education, who has been bombarding Mr Blunkett with parliamentary questions. \"The education bonanza is just a con trick,\" he said. \"Ministers have been evading my questions. When we asked about the delays, civil servants told my staff that I had tabled 'the questions from hell'. If Labour really had a record to be proud of, the truth would not hurt so much.\" </p> <p><strong> Bogus</strong><br> </p> <p> Even though the treasury select committee's alarm call passed almost entirely without notice in parliament and Fleet Street, there can be no doubt that Mr Blunkett's officials and ministers know that their \u00a319bn claim was bogus. This is not simply because the select committee report threatened to tear the guts out of their spending claims, but also because one of the Labour MPs who sat on the committee was Charles Clarke, who then became Mr Blunkett's schools minister. </p> <p>But this is not the end of the conjuring. Not even nearly. For example, not content with the magical conversion of \u00a39.7bn into \u00a319bn, Mr Blunkett and his ministers have indulged repeatedly in a second kind of trickery, in which they have recycled money through a sequence of different announcements, each time pretending that they are unveiling new spending when, in truth, they are simply delivering old money in new clothes. The distortion can be huge. Once again, if you watch closely, you can see the sleight of hand. </p> <p>On June 26 1997, the DfEE announced they would spend \u00a3100m to fulfil Labour's pledge to cut the size of classes for infants. Five months later, on November 17, the then schools minister Stephen Byers announced the release of \u00a322m to cut infant classes. But, in truth, this was part of the original \u00a3100m which had already been announced. Eleven days later, Mr Byers announced the spending of \u00a3100m to cut infant classes. It was the same money again. Two months after that, on February 12 1998, Mr Blunkett himself stepped forward to announce the spending of \u00a322m on cutting infant classes. The combined implication of the four statements was that the government was releasing \u00a3244m; in fact, it had released only \u00a3100m. </p> <p>Sometimes, in the small print at the end of the statement, the department acknowledges the truth. Invariably, this does not make its way into press reports and invariably ministers do nothing to correct the misleading impression that is left. In this same way, the department has also recycled its public finance initiative funding. A year after Mr Blunkett announced that schools would receive \u00a31bn of PFI credits, the department said: \"Schools will receive a \u00a31bn private finance boost, schools minister Jacqui Smith announced today.\" It was the same money. They have done it with the sure start scheme for pre-school children, with computer schemes for teachers, the national numeracy drive and computers for poor families. Mr Blunkett announced \u00a3575m of capital support for local authorities and voluntary-aided schools. Three weeks later: \"Charles Clarke today announced allocations to local education authorities and schools of \u00a3575m.\" </p> <p>The press release trick has added layers of confusion to the original double- and treble-counting, but now, if we dispel Mr Blunkett's illusion that he is constantly announcing new money, we come back to his \u00a319bn; and if we also dispel the multiple counting, we can see that all he is really offering is an increase of \u00a39.7bn over the last three years of the parliament. But he is not offering even that much. </p> <p>For a start, he has taken no account of inflation. In real terms, according to the Commons library, in 1997/98 prices, Mr Blunkett is actually talking about an increase over these three years of \u00a31.9bn in 1999; \u00a32.3bn 2000; and \u00a31.9bn in 2001/2. In other words, his \u00a319bn bonanza shrinks to only \u00a36.1bn. Even that would be a substantial increase, particularly in comparison to the Tory years, but look more closely. </p> <p>To work with the figures which are publicly available, we have to forget that Mr Blunkett has ignored inflation and go back to the three-year rise of \u00a39.7bn. Now, ask two questions: first, how much of this money is real and not simply the result of yet more book-keeping stunts; and, second, to the extent that it proves to be real, how much of it is additional funding and not simply the extra cash which is needed to keep pace with new demands - not just inflation but rising pupil numbers, new pension obligations and so on? </p> <p>The conjuring is well concealed. While the DfEE insists on transparency from others, its own budget remains opaque. But we can still try to trace the lion's share of the rise, the supposed increase of \u00a38.1bn which Mr Blunkett says will bring such rewards to education in England from 1999 to 2002. The short story is that there is some extra money here, but the political claim easily overshoots the reality. </p> <p>The first part of the \u00a38.1bn increase which Mr Blunkett claims to be spending in England is \u00a31.2bn for capital works - ie repairs and new buildings. In a way, this is a repeat of the press release trick - real money dressed up in hyperbole. </p> <p>The government's problem with the physical fabric of schools is immense. Estimates of the cost of repairing and replacing buildings which were neglected during the Tory years run as high as \u00a320bn. A 1995 survey found 600 primary schools still using outside toilets. Engineers have advised Bradfield comprehensive in Sheffield to put a wind gauge on top of their mobile class rooms so that they can evacuate the children before a storm takes the rotting roofs off. </p> <p>This \u00a31.2bn is part of a \u00a35.4bn programme for capital works over the next three years which was announced by Mr Blunkett in November 1998. In its flourish of optimism, the announcement echoed his claims for the \u00a319bn: \"This investment could enable major repairs in thousands more schools ... This substantial investment ... transform our schools _.\" </p> <p><strong> Hard-pressed</strong><br> </p> <p> Anyone who heard this announcement would be forgiven for believing that the government was going to invest \u00a35.4bn in capital works for schools over the next three years. However, what the government is actually investing in school buildings over the three years is only some \u00a31.735bn: \u00a31.085bn from the new deal for schools, announced by Gordon Brown in his 1997 budget as part of his windfall tax; and a further estimated \u00a3650m in cash grants for voluntary-aided church schools and former grant-maintained schools. The rest of the \u00a35.4bn contains more magical money and a degree of exaggeration. </p> <p>Some \u00a3800m has been conjured out of thin air. Contrary to being an investment by the government, this money will come from the hard-pressed local authorities - if it comes from anywhere. Contrary to being real cash, it turns out to be what the DfEE describes as a \"notional\" contribution - a Whitehall estimate of money that the local authorities might be able to come up with by selling land and buildings or by diverting cash from the rest of their education budget or from other programmes. </p> <p>The remaining \u00a32.9bn does at least represent a contribution from Whitehall, but it is not cash. It consists of \"credit approvals\" and \"PFI credits\" - ie permission to borrow cash, either from the public works board or from private finance partners. However, in the 10 months of this financial year, the government has spent only \u00a36.28m on PFI in schools. </p> <p>The permission to borrow, supported by payments from Whitehall, is arguably a real asset to local authorities although these schemes - particularly the PFI ones - are far more complex than simple cash transactions. With only two months of this financial year to run, schools have taken up only 53% of the PFI credits on offer for the year. </p> <p>The bottom line, however, is that, despite the misleading hyperbole and despite the fact that there is not nearly as much real, new cash as the government has claimed, capital projects in schools and colleges are likely to receive from one source or another something close to the extra \u00a31.2bn which the government has quoted. The same cannot be said of the second heading of funding in the supposed increase of \u00a38.1bn. </p> <p>This is an extra \u00a33.6bn for English LEAs to spend over the last three years of the parliament. This is the core of education funding: a school gets its entire annual budget from its local authority. But how much of it is real and new? Here, Mr Blunkett is performing the political equivalent of cutting his lovely assistant in half with a saw. It is such an old trick that the audience really ought to be able to see through it; and yet, it is such a good trick that it still fools them every time. </p> <p>What Mr Blunkett announced was an increase in the education standard spending assessment (SSA)and, even if his audience does not understand, he knows that an SSA is not money at all but a Whitehall guideline to indicate the level of spending which the government says would be appropriate. The money is hidden away in the conjuror's other hand, under a heading called total external support (TES), which consists of rate support grant and a central pool of business rates and various smaller grants, all of which are paid out to the local authorities through the department of environment. Don't look at the SSA. Look at the TES. </p> <p>You have to look carefully here, because governments use a traditional but highly effective concealment. They announce SSA guidelines for each area of local authority work. But when it comes to providing the money in TES, it is not broken down. They simply announce a lump sum so that nobody can say with 100% certainty how much of the increase is available for any particular service. Nevertheless, you can see the gap in Mr Blunkett's claim. </p> <p>Senior figures in the DfEE assured us that, although the Tories had habitually announced increases in the education SSA and then failed to provide the cash to back them, this government was different. The entire increase was fully funded, they claimed. However, research commissioned by Phil Willis from the Commons library shows that this claim is simply untrue. For the first year of Mr Blunkett's bonanza, 1999/00, of the 150 local authorities in England, only four received an increase in TES cash which matched the increase in their notional SSA guideline for all services. The 146 others were all left with an increase which was part fact and part fiction. Twenty of them received so little extra cash that even if they ignored every other service and passed all of it to education, they would still not have enough new money to pay for the supposed increased in education alone. The government had announced an increase in SSA for all local services of \u00a32.065bn, but they actually provided only \u00a31.5bn. Contrary to their claims, they had funded only 73% of the total increase they were announcing. </p> <p>For the current year, Mr Blunkett claims, in the words of his original announcement, that \"government is providing\" an increase of \u00a31.1bn for the LEAs. But if you look at the cash which the government is really providing in TES and, for the sake of clarity, assume that local authorities spread it equally across all their services, it turns out that the government is providing only \u00a30.8bn extra for education. Over the three years, the \u00a33.6bn guideline would turn out to be backed by only \u00a32.6bn of cash. The problem here is not simply that Mr Blunkett misled us by claiming that the government was providing the extra money; worse, the evidence is that the LEAs will struggle to provide the missing cash themselves. </p> <p>They can raise council tax, but the government has warned them that it will intervene if any of them raises local taxes too high.

      "bodyText": "There are many mysteries in David Blunkett's department for education, but the greatest of them all is this: where has all the money gone? Just over 18 months ago, on July 14 1998, Mr Blunkett announced a spending bonanza for schools. \"The government is providing an additional \u00a319bn for education over the three years from 1999 to 2002,\" he said. This was a very great deal of extra money; the budget for the entire educational establishment in the whole of the UK in 1998 was only \u00a338.3bn. Mr Blunkett declared that this was \"an historic day for education and for the country\" and \"the fulfilment of our pledge that education would be our number one priority\". These resources, he explained, would transform standards in the education service, boost literacy and numeracy for those under eleven, cut truancy and exclusion by a third, and give half a million more people access to higher and further education. More than that, he went on to pledge that this extra \u00a319bn would \"give everyone in our society the opportunity to realise their full potential\". Mr Blunkett has since pointed repeatedly to this extra \u00a319bn as the touchstone of Labour's commitment to Britain's schools. When he wrote for the Guardian in reply to the first part of this series, he said: \"Of course, our education policy is backed by substantial extra resources. The extra \u00a319bn over three years is real.\" Eighteen months after the announcement, there is little sign of this torrent of extra resources sweeping through our schools and colleges. On the contrary, we have found that the education budget is so tight that three months ago, Mr Blunkett's officials were forced to make emergency changes to keep local education authorities in the black. And when we conducted our own survey of local authorities, all but one of them reported that they had schools whose budgets were locked into deficit. Leeds, for example, said that 68 of its 299 schools are in deficit; Somerset has 32 schools in the red; Northumbria has 34; Staffordshire has 29; Rotherham has 39. So where is the \u00a319bn? Maybe it is already in the schools and we have simply failed to observe it. Maybe it is on its way down the pipeline and will arrive any week now. Or maybe it never existed. Maybe the truth is that Mr Blunkett's \u00a319bn is largely composed of magical money, literally billions of pounds which have been conjured out of thin air by trickery - double-counting, treble-counting, several different book-keeping manoeuvres and a steady stream of fundamentally misleading public statements. Watch closely and you can see the conjuror at work. The first trick is the biggest. Ever since the birth of inflation, government departments have been increasing their spending each year. When Mr Blunkett made his grand announcement in July 1998, he was reporting the results for education of chancellor Gordon Brown's comprehensive spending review, which had laid down a budget for every Whitehall department for each of the final three years of the parliament. The existing budget for UK education, for 1998/9, was \u00a338.3bn. As a result of the review, Mr Blunkett was able to announce that this would rise, in 1999, by \u00a33bn; in 2000, by \u00a33.5bn; and finally, in 2001/2, by \u00a33.2bn. That was all he announced. But, of course that adds up to only \u00a39.7bn. Where was the rest of the \u00a319bn? The answer is that it does not exist. Contrary to Mr Blunkett's description of his \u00a319bn as \"real\", nearly half of it is manufactured by a single book-keeping trick. Confusing It works like this. You take the increase for the first year and you say \"Well, if I pay this in the first year, it will become a permanent part of the budget, so I will still be paying it in subsequent years when I make further annual increases, so I should carry on counting it as an increase each year.\" This is not the way that any British government has previously accounted for its budgets. Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies says it is \"misleading\"; David Heald, professor of accountancy at Aberdeen university and adviser to the treasury select committee, says it is \"confusing\" and \"unprecedented\". But, for Mr Blunkett, the result was simply excellent. In year one, he had a rise of \u00a33bn. In year two, he had a rise of \u00a33.5bn but he added in the \u00a33bn which he would still be paying from year one and called it a rise of \u00a36.5bn. Then he came to year three, when he had a rise of \u00a33.2bn, but he added in the \u00a36.5bn which he had already committed to the budget in the first two years and called it a rise of \u00a39.7bn. Then he stood back and added the whole lot up - \u00a33bn plus \u00a36.5bn plus \u00a39.7bn. A \u00a319.2bn bonanza. In principle, there is nothing to stop the government pursuing this creative arithmetic for every subsequent year. For 2002, for example, Mr Blunkett might announce the lowest increase in education spending for years - say, a meagre \u00a32bn. But, by then he would be able to count his 1999 money four times, his 2000 money three times, his 2001 money twice. And so his meagre \u00a32bn would become a super soaraway rise of \u00a330.9bn. If he is still running education at the end of a second Labour parliament, Mr Blunkett will be able to announce annual rises which will wipe out the debt of whole continents. This analysis cannot be news to Mr Blunkett or, indeed, to Mr Brown, whose officials dreamed it up. The wizardry was spotted within two weeks of the original announcement by no less a source than the treasury select committee. This committee of MPs interviewed all of the key people who had been involved in delivering the spending review; they also took advice from three independent experts in public finance. Despite the fact that this committee is dominated by Labour MPs, they filed a highly critical report, dated July 27 1998. In the report - which received virtually no public attention at all - the MPs took one look at Mr Blunkett's \u00a319bn and saw straight through the figures. They came to two conclusions about this and about a comparable stunt with the health budget. First, in the most courteous terms, they told the government to stop playing with the numbers: \"We recommend that, for the sake of transparency, in future the government should refer to annual increases over the previous year, rather than a cumulative total.\" Second, they noted how the media had \"faithfully reproduced\" the misleading numbers. The truth is that for his first two years in power, Mr Blunkett actually invested less in education than the Tories had been and, by the end of this parliament, he will still be only marginally ahead of the Tory level of spending - a level which he used to describe as \"miserable\". This was uncovered by researchers in the Commons library who reviewed education funding during the years of Tory rule from 1979 to 1997, and worked out the average annual rise. They projected that forward for the five years of this parliament and compared the result with Mr Blunkett's budgets (even though, as we shall see, these figures are themselves questionable). They found that in his first year, (looking at England alone) Mr Blunkett spent \u00a3324m less than the projected Tory level. In his second year, he undershot them again, by \u00a3323m. In the current year, 1999/00, Labour has finally begun to nudge ahead of Tory spending levels, with an increase of \u00a3770m; but even in the fifth year, with the maximum effect of their new budget, Labour will still be spending only \u00a33bn a year more on education in England than the Tories would have done if they had stayed in office - \u00a338.8bn compared to the \u00a335.8bn projected for the Tories. The additional \u00a319bn is nowhere to be seen. One of the few MPs who has woken up to what has been happening is Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on education, who has been bombarding Mr Blunkett with parliamentary questions. \"The education bonanza is just a con trick,\" he said. \"Ministers have been evading my questions. When we asked about the delays, civil servants told my staff that I had tabled 'the questions from hell'. If Labour really had a record to be proud of, the truth would not hurt so much.\" Bogus Even though the treasury select committee's alarm call passed almost entirely without notice in parliament and Fleet Street, there can be no doubt that Mr Blunkett's officials and ministers know that their \u00a319bn claim was bogus. This is not simply because the select committee report threatened to tear the guts out of their spending claims, but also because one of the Labour MPs who sat on the committee was Charles Clarke, who then became Mr Blunkett's schools minister. But this is not the end of the conjuring. Not even nearly. For example, not content with the magical conversion of \u00a39.7bn into \u00a319bn, Mr Blunkett and his ministers have indulged repeatedly in a second kind of trickery, in which they have recycled money through a sequence of different announcements, each time pretending that they are unveiling new spending when, in truth, they are simply delivering old money in new clothes. The distortion can be huge. Once again, if you watch closely, you can see the sleight of hand. On June 26 1997, the DfEE announced they would spend \u00a3100m to fulfil Labour's pledge to cut the size of classes for infants. Five months later, on November 17, the then schools minister Stephen Byers announced the release of \u00a322m to cut infant classes. But, in truth, this was part of the original \u00a3100m which had already been announced. Eleven days later, Mr Byers announced the spending of \u00a3100m to cut infant classes. It was the same money again. Two months after that, on February 12 1998, Mr Blunkett himself stepped forward to announce the spending of \u00a322m on cutting infant classes. The combined implication of the four statements was that the government was releasing \u00a3244m; in fact, it had released only \u00a3100m. Sometimes, in the small print at the end of the statement, the department acknowledges the truth. Invariably, this does not make its way into press reports and invariably ministers do nothing to correct the misleading impression that is left. In this same way, the department has also recycled its public finance initiative funding. A year after Mr Blunkett announced that schools would receive \u00a31bn of PFI credits, the department said: \"Schools will receive a \u00a31bn private finance boost, schools minister Jacqui Smith announced today.\" It was the same money. They have done it with the sure start scheme for pre-school children, with computer schemes for teachers, the national numeracy drive and computers for poor families. Mr Blunkett announced \u00a3575m of capital support for local authorities and voluntary-aided schools. Three weeks later: \"Charles Clarke today announced allocations to local education authorities and schools of \u00a3575m.\" The press release trick has added layers of confusion to the original double- and treble-counting, but now, if we dispel Mr Blunkett's illusion that he is constantly announcing new money, we come back to his \u00a319bn; and if we also dispel the multiple counting, we can see that all he is really offering is an increase of \u00a39.7bn over the last three years of the parliament. But he is not offering even that much. For a start, he has taken no account of inflation. In real terms, according to the Commons library, in 1997/98 prices, Mr Blunkett is actually talking about an increase over these three years of \u00a31.9bn in 1999; \u00a32.3bn 2000; and \u00a31.9bn in 2001/2. In other words, his \u00a319bn bonanza shrinks to only \u00a36.1bn. Even that would be a substantial increase, particularly in comparison to the Tory years, but look more closely. To work with the figures which are publicly available, we have to forget that Mr Blunkett has ignored inflation and go back to the three-year rise of \u00a39.7bn. Now, ask two questions: first, how much of this money is real and not simply the result of yet more book-keeping stunts; and, second, to the extent that it proves to be real, how much of it is additional funding and not simply the extra cash which is needed to keep pace with new demands - not just inflation but rising pupil numbers, new pension obligations and so on? The conjuring is well concealed. While the DfEE insists on transparency from others, its own budget remains opaque. But we can still try to trace the lion's share of the rise, the supposed increase of \u00a38.1bn which Mr Blunkett says will bring such rewards to education in England from 1999 to 2002. The short story is that there is some extra money here, but the political claim easily overshoots the reality. The first part of the \u00a38.1bn increase which Mr Blunkett claims to be spending in England is \u00a31.2bn for capital works - ie repairs and new buildings. In a way, this is a repeat of the press release trick - real money dressed up in hyperbole. The government's problem with the physical fabric of schools is immense. Estimates of the cost of repairing and replacing buildings which were neglected during the Tory years run as high as \u00a320bn. A 1995 survey found 600 primary schools still using outside toilets. Engineers have advised Bradfield comprehensive in Sheffield to put a wind gauge on top of their mobile class rooms so that they can evacuate the children before a storm takes the rotting roofs off. This \u00a31.2bn is part of a \u00a35.4bn programme for capital works over the next three years which was announced by Mr Blunkett in November 1998. In its flourish of optimism, the announcement echoed his claims for the \u00a319bn: \"This investment could enable major repairs in thousands more schools ... This substantial investment ... transform our schools _.\" Hard-pressed Anyone who heard this announcement would be forgiven for believing that the government was going to invest \u00a35.4bn in capital works for schools over the next three years. However, what the government is actually investing in school buildings over the three years is only some \u00a31.735bn: \u00a31.085bn from the new deal for schools, announced by Gordon Brown in his 1997 budget as part of his windfall tax; and a further estimated \u00a3650m in cash grants for voluntary-aided church schools and former grant-maintained schools. The rest of the \u00a35.4bn contains more magical money and a degree of exaggeration. Some \u00a3800m has been conjured out of thin air. Contrary to being an investment by the government, this money will come from the hard-pressed local authorities - if it comes from anywhere. Contrary to being real cash, it turns out to be what the DfEE describes as a \"notional\" contribution - a Whitehall estimate of money that the local authorities might be able to come up with by selling land and buildings or by diverting cash from the rest of their education budget or from other programmes. The remaining \u00a32.9bn does at least represent a contribution from Whitehall, but it is not cash. It consists of \"credit approvals\" and \"PFI credits\" - ie permission to borrow cash, either from the public works board or from private finance partners. However, in the 10 months of this financial year, the government has spent only \u00a36.28m on PFI in schools. The permission to borrow, supported by payments from Whitehall, is arguably a real asset to local authorities although these schemes - particularly the PFI ones - are far more complex than simple cash transactions. With only two months of this financial year to run, schools have taken up only 53% of the PFI credits on offer for the year. The bottom line, however, is that, despite the misleading hyperbole and despite the fact that there is not nearly as much real, new cash as the government has claimed, capital projects in schools and colleges are likely to receive from one source or another something close to the extra \u00a31.2bn which the government has quoted. The same cannot be said of the second heading of funding in the supposed increase of \u00a38.1bn. This is an extra \u00a33.6bn for English LEAs to spend over the last three years of the parliament. This is the core of education funding: a school gets its entire annual budget from its local authority. But how much of it is real and new? Here, Mr Blunkett is performing the political equivalent of cutting his lovely assistant in half with a saw. It is such an old trick that the audience really ought to be able to see through it; and yet, it is such a good trick that it still fools them every time. What Mr Blunkett announced was an increase in the education standard spending assessment (SSA)and, even if his audience does not understand, he knows that an SSA is not money at all but a Whitehall guideline to indicate the level of spending which the government says would be appropriate. The money is hidden away in the conjuror's other hand, under a heading called total external support (TES), which consists of rate support grant and a central pool of business rates and various smaller grants, all of which are paid out to the local authorities through the department of environment. Don't look at the SSA. Look at the TES. You have to look carefully here, because governments use a traditional but highly effective concealment. They announce SSA guidelines for each area of local authority work. But when it comes to providing the money in TES, it is not broken down. They simply announce a lump sum so that nobody can say with 100% certainty how much of the increase is available for any particular service. Nevertheless, you can see the gap in Mr Blunkett's claim. Senior figures in the DfEE assured us that, although the Tories had habitually announced increases in the education SSA and then failed to provide the cash to back them, this government was different. The entire increase was fully funded, they claimed. However, research commissioned by Phil Willis from the Commons library shows that this claim is simply untrue. For the first year of Mr Blunkett's bonanza, 1999/00, of the 150 local authorities in England, only four received an increase in TES cash which matched the increase in their notional SSA guideline for all services. The 146 others were all left with an increase which was part fact and part fiction. Twenty of them received so little extra cash that even if they ignored every other service and passed all of it to education, they would still not have enough new money to pay for the supposed increased in education alone. The government had announced an increase in SSA for all local services of \u00a32.065bn, but they actually provided only \u00a31.5bn. Contrary to their claims, they had funded only 73% of the total increase they were announcing. For the current year, Mr Blunkett claims, in the words of his original announcement, that \"government is providing\" an increase of \u00a31.1bn for the LEAs. But if you look at the cash which the government is really providing in TES and, for the sake of clarity, assume that local authorities spread it equally across all their services, it turns out that the government is providing only \u00a30.8bn extra for education. Over the three years, the \u00a33.6bn guideline would turn out to be backed by only \u00a32.6bn of cash. The problem here is not simply that Mr Blunkett misled us by claiming that the government was providing the extra money; worse, the evidence is that the LEAs will struggle to provide the missing cash themselves. They can raise council tax, but the government has warned them that it will intervene if any of them raises local taxes too high. They can raid their reserves, as they did during the Tory years. Or they can skim money off the top of their other budgets, particularly social services. This, too, was a common tactic in the Tory years, but there is increasing pressure to reverse the flow and protect social services. There is, nevertheless, on the face of it a cash increase of some \u00a32.6bn over three years in government funding for the LEAs. So the next question is how much of this money is new and not simply swallowed up by debt and rising costs? Here, you need to understand that for years, Whitehall has been playing a game with the local authorities, holding down the SSA guidelines for education to a level which was so low that councillors were forced to spend more than the SSA to defend their schools - even if they were given no money to do so. This gap widened in the early 1990s to \u00a32.9bn a year - cash that the LEAs were spending over and above the SSA guideline, even though that guideline was not being fully funded by the Tories. But in the last six or seven years, more and more councils have been falling by the wayside, allowing spending on education to slump back to the SSA level. This is the hidden story of Britain's education funding which is concealed by the talk of rising SSAs. Blunkett's magic tricks continued here.",

      "body": "<b>'Another sexual revolution'</b> <p><b> Women's rights and healthcare advocate, New Zealand</b></p> <p> The first wish is for the National Cervical Screening Programme to get back on track with adequate money and quality controls. This week, 1,500 women from the regional town of Gisborne have learned that their cervical smears were misread between 1991 and 1996: around 500 of these women may have high-grade abnormalities which have gone untreated for years. The programme was set up by a Labour government 10 years ago but was sidelined by the previous government. </p> <p>My second wish is to see another sexual revolution led by women. The first one was about women earning the right to say yes and now women need to fight for the right to say no - to reclaim control over their bodies. What I see now is women willingly embracing damaging stereotypes concerning their bodies and their sexual behaviour. New Zealand has a major problem with eating disorders, there's a boom in cosmetic plastic surgery, then we see people like Bernadine Oliver-Kirby, a prominent sportswoman, posing on a rugby magazine cover naked from the waist up with a rugby jersey painted on her torso. How can you expect to be treated seriously and at the same time want people to look at your tits? </p> <p>My third wish is to see the gender pay gap closed. Women need money. For many years now, New Zealand women have earned 80% of what men earn and for women with degrees and higher levels of education, the gender pay gap is even greater. </p> <p><b>'Eradicating inequality in the workplace' </b></p> <p><b>Carmen Alborch MP, feminist, author and former minister of culture, Spain </b></p> <p>Spanish society still has to accept the reality of a shared world where men and women divide their rights, responsibilities and emotions equally. I would focus on employment as an area of great inequality. Our female unemployment rate is more than double that of men. Even when we are in the workplace we do not have an equal share of power. We are not in the hard-core of political, economic, scientific or academic power. We still live in a very male culture and access to these power-centres must open up. We have the academic qualifications; women now outnumber men at university. We've proved our worth but there are still immense difficulties in reaching the top or coming anywhere near it. </p> <p>We have to educate our society with new values which start with the very basics, eradicating domestic violence against women, but go much further than that. We have to do so in the family, in schools and through the media. Just one example is fighting the use of sexist language, so common in Spain. </p> <p>As women we also have to change our own perceptions of how we live and our role in society. The old-fashioned notion that women were nothing except in their relationship towards a male protector figure, as daughter, sister, wife or mother, is changing. The stereotype of the frus trated spinster is dying, but it's being replaced by another equally dangerous one of the woman who chooses to live alone as being selfish. </p> <p>Finally, we must tackle one of the great sources of poverty - emotional poverty that follows the great change in women's role in society which has been more recent and intense here than in northern European countries. There is a great incidence of poor-quality relationships in which men are unable, unwilling, unprepared or uneducated to fulfil women's needs, which causes misery to both sexes. </p> <p><b>'Many Seattles everywhere are my hope'</b></p> <p><b>Nawal El Saadawi, writer and activist, Egypt</b></p> <p>My wish for the women of Egypt is still the same. Now we have moved into the 21st century it seems to me that the faces of the women in my village have not changed. My cousin, Zeinab, who is the same age as me, looks old and sick. She sits near the entrance to her house with a TV set in front of her. From the village rises a chorus of male voices shouting out the call to prayer from microphones fixed to the top of minarets rising into the sky; competing with them is an electric sign board advertising Malborough cigarettes. </p> <p>When I hold her hand I can feel the horny knots and cracks caused by long years of labour with a hoe. She whispers: \"When I was a child I dreamed of escaping from this awful life but now I've lost hope. We worked like slaves, tilled and hoed the earth to send our children to the schools and university. Now there are no jobs, and our debts keep growing. Now we eat fava beans canned in California instead of growing enough ourselves.\" </p> <p>I see her eyes questioning. What can I say at the beginning of this millennium? Can I speak of a global system, which keeps a million people suffering of hunger, which keeps people destitute? Can I tell them that 443 people (men) own as much wealth as half the people of the earth? Can I show her how to live and fight when that is what she has always done? Can I tell her that the peoples of the the world are learning how to work together and that many Seattles everywhere, in the North and South are my wish, and my hope? </p> <p><b>'The capacity to dream and have fun'</b></p> <p><b>Urvashi Butalia, head of Kali books, India</b></p> <p>There are two stories that Indian women are fond of telling. They go like this: sometime in 800BC, Gargi, a woman philosopher, threw a challenge to Yajnavalkya, a new (male) entrant to the field of philosophy. She asked him two questions. Unable to deal with them, Yajnavalkya refused to respond to her in the marketplace, saying he would deal with the questions later, and he slunk off. </p> <p>The second story is different: thousands of years ago it is said that Mara, the devil (and a man) came upon a bhikshuni (a woman ascetic) deep in meditation. He scoffed. What does she think she is doing, he asked. All she needs is two fingers of meditation, for that is all that is needed for her work in the kitchen. The bhikshuni was unmoved: she kept her counsel. For she knew that what she was looking for was not two or more fingers worth of peace, but akasha, the all-encompassing, entire sky. </p> <p>Several centuries later, we aren't doing that much mediation, but we've been fighting, and hard. We've won some, and lost some. But like our ancestresses of many years ago, what we haven't lost is the capacity to dream, to wish, to desire. If they thought they could achieve something through meditation and questioning, we know that our goals may be the same, but our methods have to be different. </p> <p>So if the sceptical young man were to come upon me today, he wouldn't find me standing deep in mediation.

      "bodyText": "'Another sexual revolution' Women's rights and healthcare advocate, New Zealand The first wish is for the National Cervical Screening Programme to get back on track with adequate money and quality controls. This week, 1,500 women from the regional town of Gisborne have learned that their cervical smears were misread between 1991 and 1996: around 500 of these women may have high-grade abnormalities which have gone untreated for years. The programme was set up by a Labour government 10 years ago but was sidelined by the previous government. My second wish is to see another sexual revolution led by women. The first one was about women earning the right to say yes and now women need to fight for the right to say no - to reclaim control over their bodies. What I see now is women willingly embracing damaging stereotypes concerning their bodies and their sexual behaviour. New Zealand has a major problem with eating disorders, there's a boom in cosmetic plastic surgery, then we see people like Bernadine Oliver-Kirby, a prominent sportswoman, posing on a rugby magazine cover naked from the waist up with a rugby jersey painted on her torso. How can you expect to be treated seriously and at the same time want people to look at your tits? My third wish is to see the gender pay gap closed. Women need money. For many years now, New Zealand women have earned 80% of what men earn and for women with degrees and higher levels of education, the gender pay gap is even greater. 'Eradicating inequality in the workplace' Carmen Alborch MP, feminist, author and former minister of culture, Spain Spanish society still has to accept the reality of a shared world where men and women divide their rights, responsibilities and emotions equally. I would focus on employment as an area of great inequality. Our female unemployment rate is more than double that of men. Even when we are in the workplace we do not have an equal share of power. We are not in the hard-core of political, economic, scientific or academic power. We still live in a very male culture and access to these power-centres must open up. We have the academic qualifications; women now outnumber men at university. We've proved our worth but there are still immense difficulties in reaching the top or coming anywhere near it. We have to educate our society with new values which start with the very basics, eradicating domestic violence against women, but go much further than that. We have to do so in the family, in schools and through the media. Just one example is fighting the use of sexist language, so common in Spain. As women we also have to change our own perceptions of how we live and our role in society. The old-fashioned notion that women were nothing except in their relationship towards a male protector figure, as daughter, sister, wife or mother, is changing. The stereotype of the frus trated spinster is dying, but it's being replaced by another equally dangerous one of the woman who chooses to live alone as being selfish. Finally, we must tackle one of the great sources of poverty - emotional poverty that follows the great change in women's role in society which has been more recent and intense here than in northern European countries. There is a great incidence of poor-quality relationships in which men are unable, unwilling, unprepared or uneducated to fulfil women's needs, which causes misery to both sexes. 'Many Seattles everywhere are my hope' Nawal El Saadawi, writer and activist, Egypt My wish for the women of Egypt is still the same. Now we have moved into the 21st century it seems to me that the faces of the women in my village have not changed. My cousin, Zeinab, who is the same age as me, looks old and sick. She sits near the entrance to her house with a TV set in front of her. From the village rises a chorus of male voices shouting out the call to prayer from microphones fixed to the top of minarets rising into the sky; competing with them is an electric sign board advertising Malborough cigarettes. When I hold her hand I can feel the horny knots and cracks caused by long years of labour with a hoe. She whispers: \"When I was a child I dreamed of escaping from this awful life but now I've lost hope. We worked like slaves, tilled and hoed the earth to send our children to the schools and university. Now there are no jobs, and our debts keep growing. Now we eat fava beans canned in California instead of growing enough ourselves.\" I see her eyes questioning. What can I say at the beginning of this millennium? Can I speak of a global system, which keeps a million people suffering of hunger, which keeps people destitute? Can I tell them that 443 people (men) own as much wealth as half the people of the earth? Can I show her how to live and fight when that is what she has always done? Can I tell her that the peoples of the the world are learning how to work together and that many Seattles everywhere, in the North and South are my wish, and my hope? 'The capacity to dream and have fun' Urvashi Butalia, head of Kali books, India There are two stories that Indian women are fond of telling. They go like this: sometime in 800BC, Gargi, a woman philosopher, threw a challenge to Yajnavalkya, a new (male) entrant to the field of philosophy. She asked him two questions. Unable to deal with them, Yajnavalkya refused to respond to her in the marketplace, saying he would deal with the questions later, and he slunk off. The second story is different: thousands of years ago it is said that Mara, the devil (and a man) came upon a bhikshuni (a woman ascetic) deep in meditation. He scoffed. What does she think she is doing, he asked. All she needs is two fingers of meditation, for that is all that is needed for her work in the kitchen. The bhikshuni was unmoved: she kept her counsel. For she knew that what she was looking for was not two or more fingers worth of peace, but akasha, the all-encompassing, entire sky. Several centuries later, we aren't doing that much mediation, but we've been fighting, and hard. We've won some, and lost some. But like our ancestresses of many years ago, what we haven't lost is the capacity to dream, to wish, to desire. If they thought they could achieve something through meditation and questioning, we know that our goals may be the same, but our methods have to be different. So if the sceptical young man were to come upon me today, he wouldn't find me standing deep in mediation. Instead, I'd be deep in a campaign, locked in discussion with the state, fiercely opposed to the fundamentalists, fighting for the rights of minorities. If he were then to ask - as young men in the21st century might well do - what I wished for Indian women in this century, I would say an end of illiteracy, poverty and hunger, and, of course, the capacity and possibility to dream and have loads of fun. In other words, not only the whole of akasha, but a profoundly transformed akasha, a whole new sky, covering a whole new world, And I'd hope that the young man wouldn't then slink off but would stay, cast off his devilish garb, and join in the campaigns and the fun.",

On the third anniversary of the Blair election, he thinks, Londoners will be prepared to make a statement which contrives the biggest upheaval in English political arrangements since the fleeting triumph of the SDP 20 years ago, perhaps since the treachery of Ramsay MacDonald. But to make that happen, he has to confront the contradiction at the heart of his appeal. Leaving aside the merits of his case, I'll be surprised if he resolves it.</p> <p>In search of the anti-party vote, he has things on his side. The Labour party is not a pleasant spectacle. It may still be effective, but it is not nice. It did a crazy thing when it set up the electoral college to fix the Labour nomination, and then brutally rigged a result that might have been normal for old Labour but, given new Labour's pretensions, looks as corrupt as it was grotesque. This is Livingstone's high ground, from which he can fairly wipe out the meaning of his repeated vows not to run. In this bear-pit, all the beasts have filthy hands, but the great leader's are the dirtiest.</p> <p>So here is a party machine fit to vote against. The most professional political operation since the coming of universal suffrage has risen in parallel with the strongest mistrust many people have for professional politicians. The very smoothness of the Blair operation persuades electors of all parties and of none to vote to rough it up. Blair's control, on this rare occasion when it has failed, becomes an open temptation towards enforcing further de-control, his new semi-frailty in the opinion polls a reason to put the boot in deeper. It's Blair's misfortune that the London election should have fallen at what turns out to be the cusp of a shift in his fortunes, from being popular to being vulnerable, the glass perceived as being no longer half-full but half-empty.</p> <p>What, moreover, is wrong with devolution? If it's to mean something, shouldn't the anti-party man be rewarded for his courage? That's what Livingstone was saying yesterday. His decision to bolt the party was all about \"whether we have self-government for the capital\". Maybe it's only through an anti-party candidate that the promised break with British centralism has a chance of being truly effective. So say some of the most passionate advocates of the Livingstone option, who are not all secret members of the Conservative party. They see Ken as the new hero of a new politics. It's the entire basis of his campaign.</p> <p>But unfortunately it is flawed. A Livingstone mayoralty, under a statute carefully framed to limit the power of London, will not be about devolution, but about mobilising a personal struggle against the Blairism Ken abominates. And if it is seriously supposed to harness anti-party, anti-control, anti-machine populism against the Labour party, it has problems that should be insurmountable.</p> <p>One is Ken Livingstone himself. He's the very epitome of a machine politician, albeit one who neglected to keep control of the machine he once devoted his public life to building up. He is not in any way clean or new. He is not even a British John McCain, able to emerge from beltway politics, on the strength of long-ago war heroism which all his rivals ducked, and be suddenly seized on by a dissatisfied nation. The next eight weeks will comprehensively deconstruct Livingstone's pretence to be a cheeky-chappy outsider with a winning line in chutzpah.</p> <p>But secondly, the anti-party candidate is putting a lot of faith in the political zeal of a city that is supposedly fed up with everything mainline politicians are doing.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone's bet is that the people have given up on party politics. They're choked with Blair, repelled by Brown, gutted by the whole hideous lot of them. On the third anniversary of the Blair election, he thinks, Londoners will be prepared to make a statement which contrives the biggest upheaval in English political arrangements since the fleeting triumph of the SDP 20 years ago, perhaps since the treachery of Ramsay MacDonald. But to make that happen, he has to confront the contradiction at the heart of his appeal. Leaving aside the merits of his case, I'll be surprised if he resolves it. In search of the anti-party vote, he has things on his side. The Labour party is not a pleasant spectacle. It may still be effective, but it is not nice. It did a crazy thing when it set up the electoral college to fix the Labour nomination, and then brutally rigged a result that might have been normal for old Labour but, given new Labour's pretensions, looks as corrupt as it was grotesque. This is Livingstone's high ground, from which he can fairly wipe out the meaning of his repeated vows not to run. In this bear-pit, all the beasts have filthy hands, but the great leader's are the dirtiest. So here is a party machine fit to vote against. The most professional political operation since the coming of universal suffrage has risen in parallel with the strongest mistrust many people have for professional politicians. The very smoothness of the Blair operation persuades electors of all parties and of none to vote to rough it up. Blair's control, on this rare occasion when it has failed, becomes an open temptation towards enforcing further de-control, his new semi-frailty in the opinion polls a reason to put the boot in deeper. It's Blair's misfortune that the London election should have fallen at what turns out to be the cusp of a shift in his fortunes, from being popular to being vulnerable, the glass perceived as being no longer half-full but half-empty. What, moreover, is wrong with devolution? If it's to mean something, shouldn't the anti-party man be rewarded for his courage? That's what Livingstone was saying yesterday. His decision to bolt the party was all about \"whether we have self-government for the capital\". Maybe it's only through an anti-party candidate that the promised break with British centralism has a chance of being truly effective. So say some of the most passionate advocates of the Livingstone option, who are not all secret members of the Conservative party. They see Ken as the new hero of a new politics. It's the entire basis of his campaign. But unfortunately it is flawed. A Livingstone mayoralty, under a statute carefully framed to limit the power of London, will not be about devolution, but about mobilising a personal struggle against the Blairism Ken abominates. And if it is seriously supposed to harness anti-party, anti-control, anti-machine populism against the Labour party, it has problems that should be insurmountable. One is Ken Livingstone himself. He's the very epitome of a machine politician, albeit one who neglected to keep control of the machine he once devoted his public life to building up. He is not in any way clean or new. He is not even a British John McCain, able to emerge from beltway politics, on the strength of long-ago war heroism which all his rivals ducked, and be suddenly seized on by a dissatisfied nation. The next eight weeks will comprehensively deconstruct Livingstone's pretence to be a cheeky-chappy outsider with a winning line in chutzpah. But secondly, the anti-party candidate is putting a lot of faith in the political zeal of a city that is supposedly fed up with everything mainline politicians are doing. He will have little big-name support. His natural allies on the Labour left will revile him for doing what they have nobly refrained from doing. A tribe that's rife with blood feuds will happily see the streets of London paved with his guts. In place of these party enemies, we're to understand that the city at large, while being turned off politics by all the chicanery that has marked the mayoral campaign from the beginning, will become the seat of a great popular uprising in favour of Ken, millions of little donations replacing the fat cats, scores of active supporters growing into a vast army of dedicated optimists who will get out the vote on May 4. If this worked, it would be a shocking blow to Tony Blair and all he stands for.

The French scholar, Professor Ren\u00e9 Pomeau, who has died aged 83, contributed generously to this activity. As president of the prestigious Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Litt\u00e9raire de la France and professor of the Sorbonne (or as it became after 1968, the University of Paris IV), he could well have claimed to be the leading figure in Voltaire studies. </p> <p>But Pomeau was more than an expert on a single author. He was a great figure in the French university tradition of studying and teaching French literature. He was not interested in theories of literature, put forward famously by Roland Barthes, for example. He examined the history; he investigated the process of writing; he studied the text. </p> <p>He was excited by the discovery of a new letter written by Voltaire, or by the demonstration that the wording of a particular letter had been wrongly presented. He was a fine lecturer and could adapt his style for radio and television. He supervised countless theses and attended many seminars. He was a key figure in scholarship. </p> <p>Born at Beautirac, in the Gironde, Pomeau attended the Lyc\u00e9e Thiers, in Marseilles, and became a student at the University of Aix-en-Provence, before being accepted by the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris. Having graduated there, he taught in lyc\u00e9es in Tours and Angoul\u00eame. He was in Angoul\u00eame during the wartime government of Vichy, and his concern for the future of France led him to edit a newspaper, La Charente Lirre. </p> <p>Pomeau was working for the University of Toulouse when he finished his thesis on the religion of Voltaire in 1956, a book that he frequently republished. He was appointed to the Sorbonne in 1963, when he became the sort of professor that the revolutionary students of 1968 believed that they had destroyed. He spoke with authority; he was listened to with respect. </p> <p>Pomeau did not always confine himself to Voltaire. He published on the enlightenment, on Beaumarchais, on Choderlos de Laclos, Montesquieu and others. Some of his discoveries reached a wide public. He showed, for example, that Martin Folkes, who succeeded Hans Sloane in 1741 as president of the Royal Society in London, was frequently in correspondence with Maupertuis and Montesquieu, and that his letters frequently contained contraceptives. These were forbidden in France but on sale in England and, according to Pomeau, were advertised there \"in a grossly suggestive manner\". </p> <p>But Pomeau always centred his activities on Voltaire. In his lectures, he frequently posed the question: why should we continue to read Voltaire? He would often reply by quoting some text which had, he would say, been lost in the immensity of Voltaire's work, but which had a particular relevance to us today. </p> <p>He liked to turn to the best known of Voltaire's works, Candide, showing how Voltaire had added an incident to his story after reading a work on colonial slavery. The black slave, who has lost his left leg and his right arm, says to Candide: \"This is the price of you eating sugar in Europe.\" There was a blood price on sugar. And Candide, as he says a tearful farewell to the slave, knows that there is nothing he could do for him. Pomeau liked to show how Voltaire was sensitive to such horrors. The sentiment of powerlessness linked to indignation has its place in the modern world. </p> <p>Pomeau's greatest achievements were the four large volumes, Voltaire en son temps, published by the Voltaire Foundation between 1985 and 1994. With his colleagues, Pomeau put his mark on this remarkable work. Perhaps its existence explains Pomeau's view of his life, expressed in his M\u00e9moires last year. \"I have,\" he wrote, \"accomplished the task that I had set for myself.\" </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Colette, and three sons. </p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>My speech was normal until the age of six. Then somebody let off a firework behind my back taking me completely by surprise. The experience had an instantaneous, enduring effect. I immediately started developing speech problems - first with single words, then whole sentences. Though my mother was very concerned, no one understood why it had happened or what could be done to help me. Neither my younger sister or brother developed a stammer - and I could still read out loud from books without any problems. I could also sing a song freely, without stammering. My GP thought I'd grow out of it. </p> <p>Yet in conversation, I struggled endlessly trying to string a coherent sentence together. My school teachers and friends accepted this sudden change, but I felt very singled out and alone. I couldn't articulate sentences or converse out loud with anyone. Forced to take a back seat in conversations, I'd often simply reply yes or no. After three years of continued suffering, my GP recommended speech therapy sessions then, hypnotherapy. But neither helped alleviate the constant stammering. </p> <p>Throughout my teens and adult life, I felt I was always going to suffer - that I had this affliction for life and that every day, simple chores would always be problematic. Even catching a bus was a nightmarish ordeal because I couldn't articulate my destination. I would also write shopping lists to give to sales girls or just point at things that I wanted from a shop. It was very humiliating. I was always aware of people reacting strangely towards me. </p> <p>I never knew what words would get stuck in my mouth. It was all quite random - and intensely frustrating trying to articulate a particular word. Worse still, was not being able to explain my feelings to anyone because I couldn't speak clearly. Instead, I internalised all my feelings and thoughts. </p> <p>I had no self-confidence or self-esteem - and no courage to pursue things I wanted to do. Not surprisingly, it affected my career and work choices. A personnel officer once commented that only factory work would be suitable because my stammering was so severe. Naively I accepted that this was my fate - to be kept out of the public eye. Consequently, I was quiet and detached at work. </p> <p>I was so desperate to hide my stammering that many colleagues thought I was either very aloof or a total snob. Whenever I did speak, I would see awkward, embarrassed faces staring back, uncertain as to how to respond. </p> <p>When I married at 20, my first husband had been part of my circle of friends and had grown accustomed to my stammering. Even at the altar, it took an eternity to say my marriage vows. It was never an issue between us, though when we started a family I was concerned how it would affect my children. </p> <p>Thankfully, as they grew up, both my daughter Tracey, now 30, and son David, 31, never referred to my stam mering at all. They just accepted that was how their mother was - that I had problems with words and names, especially those starting with the letters B, M, W, T, or L. I couldn't even say my own name. </p> <p>Inevitably, I developed a good knack for listening so others could hold and dominate the conversation. I would never talk just for the sake of it. Instead, I would carefully consider every word before speaking. Despite the marriage only lasting six years, I have never blamed my speech problem. I had long accepted the stammering was a part of me. Though when I married again at 34, I regularly wished for a miracle cure, for years I didn't know where else to go, or what else I could try. There was no help on offer and little other option but to suffer in silence. Stammering was something that society had not fully recognised. </p> <p>Then last year, for the first time I met a recovered stammerer. He had completed a four day intensive course, the McGuire Programme, using breathing techniques and concentration to overcome his speech problems.

      "bodyText": "My speech was normal until the age of six. Then somebody let off a firework behind my back taking me completely by surprise. The experience had an instantaneous, enduring effect. I immediately started developing speech problems - first with single words, then whole sentences. Though my mother was very concerned, no one understood why it had happened or what could be done to help me. Neither my younger sister or brother developed a stammer - and I could still read out loud from books without any problems. I could also sing a song freely, without stammering. My GP thought I'd grow out of it. Yet in conversation, I struggled endlessly trying to string a coherent sentence together. My school teachers and friends accepted this sudden change, but I felt very singled out and alone. I couldn't articulate sentences or converse out loud with anyone. Forced to take a back seat in conversations, I'd often simply reply yes or no. After three years of continued suffering, my GP recommended speech therapy sessions then, hypnotherapy. But neither helped alleviate the constant stammering. Throughout my teens and adult life, I felt I was always going to suffer - that I had this affliction for life and that every day, simple chores would always be problematic. Even catching a bus was a nightmarish ordeal because I couldn't articulate my destination. I would also write shopping lists to give to sales girls or just point at things that I wanted from a shop. It was very humiliating. I was always aware of people reacting strangely towards me. I never knew what words would get stuck in my mouth. It was all quite random - and intensely frustrating trying to articulate a particular word. Worse still, was not being able to explain my feelings to anyone because I couldn't speak clearly. Instead, I internalised all my feelings and thoughts. I had no self-confidence or self-esteem - and no courage to pursue things I wanted to do. Not surprisingly, it affected my career and work choices. A personnel officer once commented that only factory work would be suitable because my stammering was so severe. Naively I accepted that this was my fate - to be kept out of the public eye. Consequently, I was quiet and detached at work. I was so desperate to hide my stammering that many colleagues thought I was either very aloof or a total snob. Whenever I did speak, I would see awkward, embarrassed faces staring back, uncertain as to how to respond. When I married at 20, my first husband had been part of my circle of friends and had grown accustomed to my stammering. Even at the altar, it took an eternity to say my marriage vows. It was never an issue between us, though when we started a family I was concerned how it would affect my children. Thankfully, as they grew up, both my daughter Tracey, now 30, and son David, 31, never referred to my stam mering at all. They just accepted that was how their mother was - that I had problems with words and names, especially those starting with the letters B, M, W, T, or L. I couldn't even say my own name. Inevitably, I developed a good knack for listening so others could hold and dominate the conversation. I would never talk just for the sake of it. Instead, I would carefully consider every word before speaking. Despite the marriage only lasting six years, I have never blamed my speech problem. I had long accepted the stammering was a part of me. Though when I married again at 34, I regularly wished for a miracle cure, for years I didn't know where else to go, or what else I could try. There was no help on offer and little other option but to suffer in silence. Stammering was something that society had not fully recognised. Then last year, for the first time I met a recovered stammerer. He had completed a four day intensive course, the McGuire Programme, using breathing techniques and concentration to overcome his speech problems. At first, I almost cynically dismissed his case as a hoax. He was totally fluent and completely in control of his speech. Run throughout Britain by recovered stammerers, the programme helps sufferers become eloquent speakers through diaphragmatic breathing and concentration training to gain fluency. Just before Christmas I signed up for a course in Bournemouth with 25 new students. Each was assigned a recovered stammerer - all of them former programme graduates - as an instructor.

She may well insist that I wear only flame red, or paint my kitchen green. The calm, middle aged woman who greets me, however, does not look crazed. As she sits me down in her neutrally decorated therapy room I realise she's already got me pegged. \"Colour therapy,\" she tells me sternly, \"is about the properties of light. It is not about pigment.\" It isn't, then, about how you paint your lounge? \"No, it's about energy: colour is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\" This means that it's somewhere between radio waves and X-rays. Apparently, Hippocrates, Paracelsus and the ancient Egyptians all used colour for healing. I'm no physicist, but there could be more to colour than meets the eye. </p> <p>Colour therapists believe you can heal the body by applying coloured light to it. This is because you have an \"aura\" (a coloured electromagnetic field that surrounds your body. The colours radiate from \"chakras\", or energy centres in the aura). Each part of your body, from its skeleton to its muscles and organs \"vibrates to\" one of these colours. When you're peaky it's because these vibrations have somehow gone off-kilter - an area of your aura will be either colourless, or vibrating to the wrong colour. So by applying the right colour to the bit of you that's unwell, you can readjust the vibrations and heal the illness. </p> <p>Clearly, this isn't easily proven. But Pauline also uses reflexology, which has become so accepted that it's even used by many hospitals. Reflexologists believe that your feet are \"mirror images\" of your body. So each bit of your foot corresponds to a specific part of your body (by pressing part of the ball of your foot, for instance, you can ease a stiff neck). Reflexology can also be used to diagnose - the tender parts of your foot signal the weaknesses in your body. Pauline is, she tells me, going to assess what bits of me need help using reflexology, then use colour to treat them. </p> <p>Pauline rubs my feet, asking sensitive questions about my life and health. Before long, I'm dying to unburden myself of every worry I've ever had. She's seen this before. Physical ailments, she believes, are rooted in emotional ones. And over her twenty odd years as an alternative therapist Pauline has become an excellent counsellor. </p> <p>What my feet say about my emotional state is anyone's guess. But as she kneads away, a remarkably accurate map of my physical weaknesses emerges. She's particularly concerned about my womb, lower back and bladder, all of which would probably have been affected by a caesarean section I had a year ago. This diagnosis suggests either that Pauline is freakishly lucky or that reflexology works. </p> <p>I honestly can't say whether colour therapy is effective or not. Pauline takes a plastic implement that looks like the injecting device from Star Trek. She fits an orange filter onto it, switches it on and holds it to the side of my foot. The colour will, she says, help strengthen and heal my womb. Finally, she suffuses my feet with orange then blue light from two large lamps. This is for general all over well-being. </p> <p>If you're not persuaded by colour therapy it's worth remembering that hospitals often treat jaundiced premature babies with blue light (it destroys the excess bilirubin that the immature liver can't remove). So if you're willing to believe that other colours can do similar things, and don't mind having your feet rubbed, then a course of \"colour integrated with reflexology\" could do you the world of good. Apart from anything else, Pauline is a wonderful listener. </p> <p>For more information contact Pauline Wills on 0181 204 7672 or email Pauline@oracleschool.fsnet.co.uk</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> The problem:</strong> One in 10 people are victims of migraine yet many suffer in silence, unaware that effective treatments exist. About 60% of sufferers never consult their GP, believing their complaint is too trivial or their doctor cannot help. Others are still not prescribed effective medication. Doctors may fail to diagnose migraine, not know which treatments work, or be reluctant to prescribe costly medication. </p> <p> <strong> Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms and triggers of migraine vary significantly. People typically suffer throbbing headaches, but other symptoms include nausea and vomiting, flashing lights or tunnel vision, sensitivity to light, noise and smells, and pins and needles in the limbs. Attacks may be triggered by certain foods, stress, going without food and too little or too much sleep. </p> <p> <strong> Treatment:</strong> There is no cure for migraine. Most people treat themselves with over-the-counter painkillers. Yet they are ineffective for many people. A worldwide review of migraine treatments by the pain relief unit at Oxford's Churchill hospital found that triptans - prescription-only drugs developed in the last decade - can effectively reduce and eliminate migraine pain. The review found that sumatriptan (brand name Imigran) by injection works best, curing headache for about half of sufferers within two hours. Of the tablets, rizatriptan 10mg (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan 5 mg (Zomig) work well, but are less effective at lower doses. Tolfenamic acid (Clotam) - not a triptan - appears to work equally well. Imigran 100mg tablets and Imigran nasal spray are fairly effective while the lower dose tablets are less so. There is less evidence for the effectiveness of two tablets, naratriptan (Naramig) and Cafergot (a different drug group), the review found. </p> <p> <strong> Prevention:</strong> Avoiding triggers can help. If attacks are frequent, prophylactics, like Sanomigran and Deseril, can help but may have unpleasant side effects. The herbal remedy feverfew shows good results in trials but, on current evidence, homeopathic treatment works no better than placebos. </p> <p> <strong> More information:</strong> Oxford's pain relief unit has a website with research on interventions for pain at <a href=\"http://www.ebando.com.\">www.ebando.com.</a> Or send an SAE to Migraine Action, 178a High Road, Byfleet, Surrey KT14 7ED (01932 352468).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The problem: One in 10 people are victims of migraine yet many suffer in silence, unaware that effective treatments exist. About 60% of sufferers never consult their GP, believing their complaint is too trivial or their doctor cannot help. Others are still not prescribed effective medication. Doctors may fail to diagnose migraine, not know which treatments work, or be reluctant to prescribe costly medication. Symptoms: Symptoms and triggers of migraine vary significantly. People typically suffer throbbing headaches, but other symptoms include nausea and vomiting, flashing lights or tunnel vision, sensitivity to light, noise and smells, and pins and needles in the limbs. Attacks may be triggered by certain foods, stress, going without food and too little or too much sleep. Treatment: There is no cure for migraine. Most people treat themselves with over-the-counter painkillers. Yet they are ineffective for many people. A worldwide review of migraine treatments by the pain relief unit at Oxford's Churchill hospital found that triptans - prescription-only drugs developed in the last decade - can effectively reduce and eliminate migraine pain. The review found that sumatriptan (brand name Imigran) by injection works best, curing headache for about half of sufferers within two hours. Of the tablets, rizatriptan 10mg (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan 5 mg (Zomig) work well, but are less effective at lower doses. Tolfenamic acid (Clotam) - not a triptan - appears to work equally well. Imigran 100mg tablets and Imigran nasal spray are fairly effective while the lower dose tablets are less so. There is less evidence for the effectiveness of two tablets, naratriptan (Naramig) and Cafergot (a different drug group), the review found. Prevention: Avoiding triggers can help. If attacks are frequent, prophylactics, like Sanomigran and Deseril, can help but may have unpleasant side effects. The herbal remedy feverfew shows good results in trials but, on current evidence, homeopathic treatment works no better than placebos. More information: Oxford's pain relief unit has a website with research on interventions for pain at www.ebando.com.

      "body": "<p>It is increasingly clear to me that my toddler lives in a perilous, experimental, illogical world. Her rules are not mine. Indeed, she may not have any rules at all. She is subject to sudden mood swings. She often doesn't listen when I tell her things. She has a short attention span. She is, as far as I know, a normal, healthy 15-month-old child. </p> <p>These behavioural traits can, however, in the extreme, be signs of a psychological disorder called attention deficit hyperactity disorder (ADHD). In very young children the dividing line between an irrational and difficult toddler and one with actual psychological problems must, then, be pretty blurred. For this reason, a study published last week in the journal of the American medical association makes mind-boggling reading. </p> <p>Researchers at the university of Maryland found that in the US many children as young as two years old are being prescribed mind-altering drugs for disorders such as hyperactivity, depression, insomnia or obsessive-compulsive disorder. And this trend is growing fast. The team found that between 1991 and 1995 the number of psychiatric drugs prescribed to these pre-school children rose by 50%. </p> <p>So what's going on? Are American parents becoming more neurotic? Or are psychological illnesses in young children on the increase? And are things going the same way here? </p> <p>Certainly, the trend towards giving children drugs for psychiatric reasons is not confined to the other side of the Atlantic. In Britain there was widespread concern last year when figures were released showing that prescriptions for Ritalin, used to treat children suffering from ADHD, had shot up. In England the number of prescriptions for this drug rose from 3,500 in 1993 to 126,500 in 1998. This increase has been so steep that it provoked the international drugs control board, a United Nations agency, to issue a warning last year that doctors in the UK are prescribing too much Ritalin to too many children. </p> <p>But at least the vast majority of children in Britain who are taking Ritalin, or other psychiatric drugs, including the anti-depressant Prozac, are of school age. We are not - yet - doling out mind-altering pharmaceuticals to toddlers. Well, not in any significant numbers, anyway. </p> <p>According to Professor Peter Hill, consultant child psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street hospital in London, psychiatric drugs are rarely prescribed for under-5s because \"pre-school children show a variety of emotional and behavioural problems, most of which relate to their living situation.\" It is, he says, unwise to label a pre-school child as depressed, or hyperactive and use drugs to treat this. \"I would be very, very cautious before deciding to make a diagnosis like depression, ADHD or obsessive compulsive disorder. And even if I thought a four year old was genuinely primary ADHD I wouldn't leap in with medication.\" </p> <p>Dr Rea Reason, educational psychologist at Manchester univeristy, who chaired the British psychological society's 1996 working party on ADHD is similarly cautious: \"Its nature and its definition keeps shifting.\" It is a \"package of difficulties\" and \"diagnosis is a quagmire, at any age.\" It is, she believes, far more important to understand the child, than to label the disorder. \"We need to examine different influencing factors for a child's behaviour,\" says Reason. There are \"ethical issues to using medication to control childrens' behaviour.\" </p> <p>And apart from the difficulties of \"diagnosing\" a toddler's erratic behaviour, there's also the fact that the drugs themselves may not work. \"There is no evidence to show that psychotropic treatment in very young children actually does any good,\" says Malcolm Lader, professor of psychopharmacology at the Institute of Psychiatry. In fact, these drugs might actually do a child long-term damage. \"If it was a grandchild of mine,\" says Lader, \"I would not prescribe it. The human brain at this age is still developing and maturing and there have been no satisfactory clinical trials for the use of drugs like Ritalin on young children.\" Indeed, when in one study last year, researchers gave Prozac to baby rats of the same age as pre-school children, the drug produced long-standing changes in the brain. </p> <p>There are, of course, guidelines as to how drugs such as Prozac and Ritalin should be used. Anyone prescribing these, or other such drugs to children, would have to justify their decision by citing a \"reasonable body of medical evidence\" if anything went wrong. These guidelines say that Ritalin should not be used on children under six and that Prozac is not recommended for children under 16. But strictly speaking there's nothing to stop a GP, paediatrician or psychiatrist from putting your difficult three year old on Prozac. In fact a recent government green paper on reform of the mental health act proposed that doctors should be able to drug children without parental consent if they have \"any disability or disorder of the mind or brain, whether permanent or temporary, which results in an impairment of disturbance of mental functioning.\" </p> <p>For some parents, of course, consent isn't an issue. They're desperate for anything that will help \"normalise\" their child. Most parents will at some point have watched in horror as their little force of destruction barrels through a room, rampages through a jumbo jet, or disrupts a checkout queue. And most of us have probably, in our darker moments, longed for a drug that will silence a hysterical, insomniac child. But in practice, few of us would resort to medication, least of all medication that might harm our child. </p> <p>But then, this is probably because few of us have any concept of what it's actually like to bring up a child with what Peter Hill calls \"a mental disorder.\" Gill Mead, founder of the ADHD family support group who talks to thousands of distressed parents a year, is adamant that the drugs can and do work. </p> <p>Consider, for example, Joe. He is three and has already been expelled from two nurseries for hitting and biting the other children. He screams ceaselessly if his mother is out of his sight. He is hyperactive. He will tell his mother to \"Fuck off, you bitch\" (a sign, Mead believes, of Tourette's syndrome, often associated with ADHD). A spider, a trip to Tesco, even a loud noise can render him hysterical for hours. Mead believes that Joe is suffering from ADHD. \"Ritalin would work,\" she says, \"without a doubt.\" </p> <p>But when, exactly, does a toddler leave \"difficult\" and become \"disordered\"? Critics of the drug trend believe that the rise in prescriptions for under-fives in the US can be put down to parents being unable to cope with difficult children, and not to a rise in mental disorders or the diagnosis of them. \"In the US there is gross over-prescription in all children, for what is normal, boistrous behaviour,\" says Malcolm Lader. </p> <p>Deborah Lobe, policy and information manager at the childrens' mental health charity Young Minds, believes that this is unlikely to spread to the UK: \"The system here works well for under-5s at the moment.\" GPs, she says, would not prescribe drugs like Ritalin. They would refer the child straight to a paediatrician. Waiting lists, which can prove so destructive for parents of older children who might wait as long as a year for psychiatric referrals, are short for under-fives. </p> <p>The youngest child she has recently come across with ADHD is 15 months old. He is already on Ritalin. That's the same age as my daughter. It seems inconceivable that anyone could diagnose my child, at this age, with any kind of psychological disorder. But then, she's not banging her head against things, compulsively, all day long; having to wear a crash helmet, and never sleeping. </p> <p>But are drugs like Prozac and Ritalin really the answer? The researchers in the American study say there is a growing acceptance of drugs as a quick fix for parents who are worried about their children. Whether or not this proves true, what's clear is that alarm bells should be ringing.

Founded by four University of Michigan undergraduates in 1997, Versity.com pays students a reported $8-$12 a time to take notes of lectures, which it then posts on the web. The service is financed by advertising, and so is free to its customers. </p> <p>So far, 36 Yale courses have been included. Recently Yale's lawyers wrote to Versity.com to demand it remove these from its site, which it has done. The dean also wrote to all students pointing out that they were violating university regulations by working for a commercial company without permission. </p> <p>There is concern on other campuses too. What has probably most annoyed the academic community is the covert nature of all this. </p> <p>The first I heard of Versity.com was when I was alerted that notes of my lectures were on the site. I have no means of knowing which eager young entrepreneur was providing this service.

      "bodyText": "An academic legal battle is looming in America over the activities of an internet company called Versity.com. Founded by four University of Michigan undergraduates in 1997, Versity.com pays students a reported $8-$12 a time to take notes of lectures, which it then posts on the web. The service is financed by advertising, and so is free to its customers. So far, 36 Yale courses have been included. Recently Yale's lawyers wrote to Versity.com to demand it remove these from its site, which it has done. The dean also wrote to all students pointing out that they were violating university regulations by working for a commercial company without permission. There is concern on other campuses too. What has probably most annoyed the academic community is the covert nature of all this. The first I heard of Versity.com was when I was alerted that notes of my lectures were on the site. I have no means of knowing which eager young entrepreneur was providing this service. Versity.com makes a strong point of guaranteeing its agents' \"privacy\".

      "body": "<p>University quality watchdogs in the UK are threatening to kill off the MBA title as part of a drive to make the thousands of postgraduate degrees on offer to students clearer and more consistent. Proposals to apply the masters name to postgraduate courses, and not further specialised undergraduate study, could sound the death knell for the MBA, honorary MA, and Scottish MA titles.</p> <p>MBA representatives, though, have argued that the proposals are misguided and would, in fact, lead to confusion over one of the most renowned brand names in the postgraduate market.</p> <p>The recommendations to rename and reorganise postgraduate degrees come from the UK Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education which is attempting to tidy up a postgraduate sector, which many believe has grown out of control. A boom in postgraduate courses, particularly taught masters degrees, over the last decade has seen a plethora of qualifications introduced by universities. But while many degrees share similar titles, they can have very different aims and standards.</p> <p>In its response to the QAA proposals, the National Postgraduate Committee, which represents postgraduate students, said: \"We believe postgraduate qualifications must be clarified and reorganised to allow comparability and consistency within the higher education sector. We further believe it is essential that the issue of nomenclature is addressed and the sector accepts its responsibilities to provide clear, unambiguous information to students, employers and the wider public.\"</p> <p>Last year, the proposed reforms hit the headlines as they set the agency on a collision course with Oxford and Cambridge universities, which award honorary masters degrees to undergraduate students who have only finished their first degrees. There would be no place for such awards under the new postgraduate framework. But if ratified by universities and the government, the proposals would also mean specialist masters courses, such as the Masters in Business Administration, would also lose their masters status.</p> <p>Already the proposals to restrict the masters title to postgraduate level courses only have received the backing from postgraduate representatives. \"We hope that the QAA will not shy away from the more contentious issues that this principle implies such as Scottish MA qualifications, DPhils and honorary MAs from Oxford and Cambridge and anomalous qualifications such as MEng or MBA which are essentially undergraduate level courses,\" said the NPC. \"If the new framework is to command respect and be consistent then the titles of qualifications such as those mentioned must be changed to reflect the true nature of the qualification both in terms of level and credit.\"</p> <p>The proposals, though, have received short shrift from the official accreditation body for MBAs, the Association of MBAs.</p> <p>\"Any change to the use of academic titles should be aimed at dispelling obfuscation, in the minds of the public, as to the nature of an individual programme of study,\" said Peter Callidine, the association's educational services manager. \"The content of the MBA curriculum, and the new-found skills of MBA graduates, are known quantities for the end users, the MBA graduate and his/ her employer. To change the title would cause unnecessary confusion.\"</p> <p>Callidine said that over 17,000 new students enrolled on MBA programmes from UK universities in 1998, making it the most popular postgraduate qualification. The MBA is a huge revenue earner for British universities, probably bringing in over \u00a3200m per year. \"Even if the MBA title ceased to exist in the UK, the demand would not. Overseas students in particular would still recognise the MBA qualification, but they would have to study at a non-UK institution. More British students would study outside the UK. A Pyrrhic victory for the QAA, indeed.\"</p> <p>The association believes that arguments suggesting that MBAs are masquerading behind an inflated title are ill-founded. The MBA is seen as a vocational degree and both a post-experience and postgraduate qualification. As part of its accreditation criteria, the association stresses that students should have a minimum of two years' work experience. \"It is specious to argue that this quality of learning is not, somehow, equal to that offered at masters level in, say, a humanities subject,\" argued Callidine.</p> <p>The QAA is expected to publish its final proposals later in the year.</p> <p>\u0095 Dr Lee Elliot Major is deputy editor of Research Fortnight</p>",

      "bodyText": "University quality watchdogs in the UK are threatening to kill off the MBA title as part of a drive to make the thousands of postgraduate degrees on offer to students clearer and more consistent. Proposals to apply the masters name to postgraduate courses, and not further specialised undergraduate study, could sound the death knell for the MBA, honorary MA, and Scottish MA titles. MBA representatives, though, have argued that the proposals are misguided and would, in fact, lead to confusion over one of the most renowned brand names in the postgraduate market. The recommendations to rename and reorganise postgraduate degrees come from the UK Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education which is attempting to tidy up a postgraduate sector, which many believe has grown out of control. A boom in postgraduate courses, particularly taught masters degrees, over the last decade has seen a plethora of qualifications introduced by universities. But while many degrees share similar titles, they can have very different aims and standards. In its response to the QAA proposals, the National Postgraduate Committee, which represents postgraduate students, said: \"We believe postgraduate qualifications must be clarified and reorganised to allow comparability and consistency within the higher education sector. We further believe it is essential that the issue of nomenclature is addressed and the sector accepts its responsibilities to provide clear, unambiguous information to students, employers and the wider public.\" Last year, the proposed reforms hit the headlines as they set the agency on a collision course with Oxford and Cambridge universities, which award honorary masters degrees to undergraduate students who have only finished their first degrees. There would be no place for such awards under the new postgraduate framework. But if ratified by universities and the government, the proposals would also mean specialist masters courses, such as the Masters in Business Administration, would also lose their masters status. Already the proposals to restrict the masters title to postgraduate level courses only have received the backing from postgraduate representatives. \"We hope that the QAA will not shy away from the more contentious issues that this principle implies such as Scottish MA qualifications, DPhils and honorary MAs from Oxford and Cambridge and anomalous qualifications such as MEng or MBA which are essentially undergraduate level courses,\" said the NPC. \"If the new framework is to command respect and be consistent then the titles of qualifications such as those mentioned must be changed to reflect the true nature of the qualification both in terms of level and credit.\" The proposals, though, have received short shrift from the official accreditation body for MBAs, the Association of MBAs. \"Any change to the use of academic titles should be aimed at dispelling obfuscation, in the minds of the public, as to the nature of an individual programme of study,\" said Peter Callidine, the association's educational services manager. \"The content of the MBA curriculum, and the new-found skills of MBA graduates, are known quantities for the end users, the MBA graduate and his/ her employer. To change the title would cause unnecessary confusion.\" Callidine said that over 17,000 new students enrolled on MBA programmes from UK universities in 1998, making it the most popular postgraduate qualification. The MBA is a huge revenue earner for British universities, probably bringing in over \u00a3200m per year. \"Even if the MBA title ceased to exist in the UK, the demand would not. Overseas students in particular would still recognise the MBA qualification, but they would have to study at a non-UK institution. More British students would study outside the UK. A Pyrrhic victory for the QAA, indeed.\" The association believes that arguments suggesting that MBAs are masquerading behind an inflated title are ill-founded. The MBA is seen as a vocational degree and both a post-experience and postgraduate qualification. As part of its accreditation criteria, the association stresses that students should have a minimum of two years' work experience. \"It is specious to argue that this quality of learning is not, somehow, equal to that offered at masters level in, say, a humanities subject,\" argued Callidine. The QAA is expected to publish its final proposals later in the year. \u0095 Dr Lee Elliot Major is deputy editor of Research Fortnight",

Buzz Lightyear and Woody's antics this weekend earned Disney \u00a32.8m (a substantial drop from last week's school holiday high); the movie already taken nearly $60m (\u00a337.5m) in the UK alone, and looks set to be the year's highest grossing movie. It never rains but it pours on The Beach. As if plunging out of the US top 10 after just two weeks wasn't enough, Fox's much-hyped backpacker saga now finds itself under renewed attack from those pesky Thai environmentalists. Protesters are planning to burn an effigy of star Leonardo DiCaprio at tonight's Bangkok premiere to highlight what they claim to be the production's destruction of protected Maya Beach on Phi Phi Island. DiCaprio, needless to say, will not be attending the premiere. Casting couch Eddie Murphy has agreed to star in a remake of 1957's The Incredible Shrinking Man, directed by Peter Segal, who has just finished working with Murphy on The Nutty Professor 2. Following the success of Austin Powers, Mike Myers is to recreate another of his Saturday Night Live characters for the big screen. Myers is to play Dieter - an avant-garde German talk show host with a passion for asking guests to touch his monkey - in Sprockets. Myers' decision is bad news for fans who were hoping to see him involved in the mooted Scooby Doo adaptation. Cate Blanchett is in talks to star in Taking Lives, an adaptation of Michael Pye's novel about a female FBI profiler tracking a serial killer who assumes his victims' identities.",

John Allan, 48, of Birkenhead, Wirral, killed 43-year-old Cheryl Lewis with a dose of cyanide in an attempt to inherit her \u00a3400,000 fortune. Her death was initially a mystery to police and Ms Lewis' family but Allan was ultimately caught out by a series of lies and a forged will. After the jury of five men and five women returned their majority verdict at the end of a seven-week trial at Liverpool crown court, police revealed that they feared Allan might have killed again had he not been arrested. It is thought that within weeks of killing Ms Lewis he had already lined up his second victim -a new girlfriend - whom he tried to poison. Earlier the court had heard how Allan murdered Ms Lewis in October 1998 by slipping the poison into her gin and tonic nightcap as they prepared to go to bed in the New Winter Palace in Luxor. As she lay sweating and barely breathing Alan asked for a doctor to be called, saying: \"I think she's dying.\" A US tourist asked him to try to save her with mouth to mouth resuscitation, but he refused, apparently fearing fumes from the poison. Allan had forged Ms Lewis' 1993 will, leaving himself as the sole beneficiary. He blamed drug dealers, arms runners or diamond smugglers for her killing, linking it with his own invented past as a mercenary, Secret Service agent and diamond dealer. After his arrest, police found four briquettes of sodium cyanide, one with an amount carved off, stowed in Ms Lewis's car, which he had continued to drive after her death. The judge, Mrs Justice Smith, told Allan: \" This was a cruel and pre-meditated killing. \"In the privacy of your hotel room you abused the trust and confidence which Cheryl Lewis placed in you as her partner and in my view you tricked her into taking cyanide. \"You must then have watched her suffer until she was beyond making a complaint.\" The judge said she would recommend to the home secretary that Allan should stay in prison \"for a very long time\". Outside court Ms Lewis' father, Eric Lewis, said: \"All we as a family wanted was justice for Cheryl and thank God justice prevailed. \"As we all know Allan was a self-confessed liar, forger and an evil man and of course he has been found guilty of committing the ultimate crime. The jury had taken more than 17 hours to reach its verdict since first retiring last Thursday. As Allan was led away to begin his sentence, police said they were convinced his arrest and conviction had prevented a potential serial killer from carrying out more murders. Within weeks of killing Ms Lewis, with whom he had a relationship for seven years, Allan had befriended one of her golfing partners, 53-year-old Jennifer Hughes and, police believe, had already given her a dose of cyanide causing her to fall ill. Detective Superintendent Dave Smith, who led the investigation, said after the case: \"I feel the sentence makes the community a great deal safer. He is a very dangerous man. \"We believe Jennifer Hughes was the next victim.\"",

      "body": "<p>Today's conference is an important initiative. Not just because it is government, business and employees coming together in partnership to look at a key economic issue. But because of what we're here to look at - the new, knowledge-based economy, and its importance to Britain's future.</p> <p>I strongly believe that the knowledge economy is our best route for success and prosperity.</p> <p>But we must be careful not to make a fundamental mistake. We mustn't think that because the knowledge economy is the future, it will happen only in the future. The new knowledge economy is here, and it is now.</p> <p>This new, knowledge-driven economy is a major change. I believe it is the equivalent of the machine-driven economy of the industrial revolution.</p> <p>But our job is to help people with that change. Not to resist it, and so suffocate opportunity. But not just to let change happen, regardless of the consequence. Our approach, what I call the Third Way, is to manage that process of change to extend opportunity and prosperity for all. To find a way which provides for efficiency in the knowledge economy, and ensuring that everyone feels its benefit. Enterprise and fairness. That is our goal.</p> <p>For some people, the advent of the new economy may be a matter of nervousness - even fear. Whole countries may be staring at the prospect of being outpaced, and left behind.</p> <p>For Britain, the new economy is unquestionably a challenge. But it is a challenge we are now better equipped to face with confidence because of the tough decisions we have already taken to secure a sound economic base - an economy based on a platform of stability, and steady growth.</p> <p>Because macroeconomic stability is the first key element of the new economy. Without stability in the economy, businesses - particularly businesses in rapidly-moving areas like E-commerce - can't plan and can't invest and can't grow. Stability is not an optional extra. It is central to the new economy.</p> <p>The second element is the revolution in technology - and especially information technology. Britain has long been a pioneer in advanced forefront of technology and scientific development. But science and technology is advancing faster than ever before. For business the key to success is how fast they can adopt and adapt these new technologies.</p> <p>IT and communications are vital parts of this. Businesses based on or using IT are at the cutting edge of the new economy. E-commerce and the Internet are already changing business fast. Transaction costs are tumbling. One US bank estimates that the effect of e-commerce is to reduce its cost per transaction from $1 to 1 cent. Astonishing.</p> <p>The Internet is dissolving physical barriers, and levelling the business playing field. It doesn't matter how small a company you are. You have the choice now of defining your business as global. Standard business thinking used to see big as inevitably beating small. Now fast beats slow. The opportunity is there for business to take.</p> <p>E-mail and the Internet may still be a closed world to some people. But especially for the new band of young e-entrepreneurs, and indeed for many young people generally, the Internet is a normal part of life. The e-generation is with us.</p> <p>Unleashing the full potential of people - our most valuable resource - is the third element of the new, modern economy. In one respect, that means reforming welfare, making work pay, establishing the work ethic for the whole of society. Tackling exclusion. In another, it means an endless emphasis on education, and on skills - a ceaseless focus on driving up standards in order to ensure that opportunity for all is real.</p> <p>I want Britain to be at the forefront of the knowledge economy. Europe too.</p> <p>Britain was the first industrial power. Our role as the workshop of the world stemmed from our character as a creative and hard-working people. The combination of adventure and application was a potent mix for Britain. And it still is.</p> <p>For businesses, the challenge they face is widening the reach of the new economy.</p> <p>Many of the British companies already involved in E-commerce are eagerly embracing the opportunities the new economy holds out. But we know we have a good way to go. The new knowledge-driven economy is not just about the new, high-tech industries like biotechnology or software development - companies which have built directly on the UK's university and science base. The new economy isn't either just the new technologies like IT and the Internet.</p> <p>It is instead about new sources of competitive advantage. The ability to innovate. To create new products. To exploit new markets. Using whatever means which are appropriate, including IT and E-commerce. And that applies to all businesses, in all sectors. High-tech and low-tech. Manufacturing and services. Businesses in long-established sectors can find ways of using these new approaches to refresh and revitalise their operations. The knowledge economy can become an indivisible part of the way all businesses work.</p> <p>For individuals, the opportunities and benefits the new economy offers must not be the sole domain of elite knowledge workers.</p> <p>Learning is the key to individuals succeeding in the new economy. At school, in further education, throughout people's working lives. The key capability for people to survive and thrive in the new economy is their capacity to learn, and then to apply that learning.</p> <p>So we have to make sure that the new economy is not just for a privileged few - for the relatively small number of companies working in the world of E-commerce, for example, and for the relatively tightly-drawn social grouping which tends to use the Internet today.</p> <p>Looking just at the Internet, currently half the people in Britain who are online come from the very top social groups. Almost forty per cent are in a single age band of 15-24. We have to make sure people are not excluded from this revolutionary technology.</p> <p>Over the last few days, we have seen a number of important announcements about how people can best use the Internet. My point is this: this technology is revolutionising the way we work, the way we do business - the way we live our lives. Our job is to make sure it is not the preserve of an elite - but an Internet for the people.</p> <p>We have to democratise the new economy. We must ensure that it is open to all.</p> <p>But it's not only Britain which needs to embrace the new economy fully. Europe needs to as well.</p> <p>We're privileged to have Antonio Guterres with us here today. He will address you shortly. He and I and other European leaders will be meeting in Lisbon in a few weeks' time for a European Council.</p> <p>A decade ago, a European Council on economic and social policy would have been all about regulation. Now, there is a transformation.</p> <p>We are meeting in Lisbon with a clear strategic goal in mind: to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive area in the world.</p> <p>We want to see a Europe of full employment in modern labour market conditions. A Europe based on an innovative and knowledge-driven economy. We want a Europe with macro-economic policies which will give sustainable growth. We want to ensure people have the skills they need. And we want to see a reformed economy which will promote competitiveness.</p> <p>I know this is a challenging agenda. But I know if we can achieve it, the Lisbon summit should come to be seen as a landmark in modern economic and social policies for Europe for the next decade. The prize is great: better growth, better employment and better social cohesion.</p> <p>We want to see as well the remaining barriers to e-commerce removed. We want to see fast and cheap access to the Internet. Britain is now leading Europe in the new Internet economy. Looking at E-commerce trading, we are ahead of Germany and ahead of France. Four times the European average.</p> <p>Over one in six homes in Britain now have access to the Internet.

      "bodyText": "Today's conference is an important initiative. Not just because it is government, business and employees coming together in partnership to look at a key economic issue. But because of what we're here to look at - the new, knowledge-based economy, and its importance to Britain's future. I strongly believe that the knowledge economy is our best route for success and prosperity. But we must be careful not to make a fundamental mistake. We mustn't think that because the knowledge economy is the future, it will happen only in the future. The new knowledge economy is here, and it is now. This new, knowledge-driven economy is a major change. I believe it is the equivalent of the machine-driven economy of the industrial revolution. But our job is to help people with that change. Not to resist it, and so suffocate opportunity. But not just to let change happen, regardless of the consequence. Our approach, what I call the Third Way, is to manage that process of change to extend opportunity and prosperity for all. To find a way which provides for efficiency in the knowledge economy, and ensuring that everyone feels its benefit. Enterprise and fairness. That is our goal. For some people, the advent of the new economy may be a matter of nervousness - even fear. Whole countries may be staring at the prospect of being outpaced, and left behind. For Britain, the new economy is unquestionably a challenge. But it is a challenge we are now better equipped to face with confidence because of the tough decisions we have already taken to secure a sound economic base - an economy based on a platform of stability, and steady growth. Because macroeconomic stability is the first key element of the new economy. Without stability in the economy, businesses - particularly businesses in rapidly-moving areas like E-commerce - can't plan and can't invest and can't grow. Stability is not an optional extra. It is central to the new economy. The second element is the revolution in technology - and especially information technology. Britain has long been a pioneer in advanced forefront of technology and scientific development. But science and technology is advancing faster than ever before. For business the key to success is how fast they can adopt and adapt these new technologies. IT and communications are vital parts of this. Businesses based on or using IT are at the cutting edge of the new economy. E-commerce and the Internet are already changing business fast. Transaction costs are tumbling. One US bank estimates that the effect of e-commerce is to reduce its cost per transaction from $1 to 1 cent. Astonishing. The Internet is dissolving physical barriers, and levelling the business playing field. It doesn't matter how small a company you are. You have the choice now of defining your business as global. Standard business thinking used to see big as inevitably beating small. Now fast beats slow. The opportunity is there for business to take. E-mail and the Internet may still be a closed world to some people. But especially for the new band of young e-entrepreneurs, and indeed for many young people generally, the Internet is a normal part of life. The e-generation is with us. Unleashing the full potential of people - our most valuable resource - is the third element of the new, modern economy. In one respect, that means reforming welfare, making work pay, establishing the work ethic for the whole of society. Tackling exclusion. In another, it means an endless emphasis on education, and on skills - a ceaseless focus on driving up standards in order to ensure that opportunity for all is real. I want Britain to be at the forefront of the knowledge economy. Europe too. Britain was the first industrial power. Our role as the workshop of the world stemmed from our character as a creative and hard-working people. The combination of adventure and application was a potent mix for Britain. And it still is. For businesses, the challenge they face is widening the reach of the new economy. Many of the British companies already involved in E-commerce are eagerly embracing the opportunities the new economy holds out. But we know we have a good way to go. The new knowledge-driven economy is not just about the new, high-tech industries like biotechnology or software development - companies which have built directly on the UK's university and science base. The new economy isn't either just the new technologies like IT and the Internet. It is instead about new sources of competitive advantage. The ability to innovate. To create new products. To exploit new markets. Using whatever means which are appropriate, including IT and E-commerce. And that applies to all businesses, in all sectors. High-tech and low-tech. Manufacturing and services. Businesses in long-established sectors can find ways of using these new approaches to refresh and revitalise their operations. The knowledge economy can become an indivisible part of the way all businesses work. For individuals, the opportunities and benefits the new economy offers must not be the sole domain of elite knowledge workers. Learning is the key to individuals succeeding in the new economy. At school, in further education, throughout people's working lives. The key capability for people to survive and thrive in the new economy is their capacity to learn, and then to apply that learning. So we have to make sure that the new economy is not just for a privileged few - for the relatively small number of companies working in the world of E-commerce, for example, and for the relatively tightly-drawn social grouping which tends to use the Internet today. Looking just at the Internet, currently half the people in Britain who are online come from the very top social groups. Almost forty per cent are in a single age band of 15-24. We have to make sure people are not excluded from this revolutionary technology. Over the last few days, we have seen a number of important announcements about how people can best use the Internet. My point is this: this technology is revolutionising the way we work, the way we do business - the way we live our lives. Our job is to make sure it is not the preserve of an elite - but an Internet for the people. We have to democratise the new economy. We must ensure that it is open to all. But it's not only Britain which needs to embrace the new economy fully. Europe needs to as well. We're privileged to have Antonio Guterres with us here today. He will address you shortly. He and I and other European leaders will be meeting in Lisbon in a few weeks' time for a European Council. A decade ago, a European Council on economic and social policy would have been all about regulation. Now, there is a transformation. We are meeting in Lisbon with a clear strategic goal in mind: to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive area in the world. We want to see a Europe of full employment in modern labour market conditions. A Europe based on an innovative and knowledge-driven economy. We want a Europe with macro-economic policies which will give sustainable growth. We want to ensure people have the skills they need. And we want to see a reformed economy which will promote competitiveness. I know this is a challenging agenda. But I know if we can achieve it, the Lisbon summit should come to be seen as a landmark in modern economic and social policies for Europe for the next decade. The prize is great: better growth, better employment and better social cohesion. We want to see as well the remaining barriers to e-commerce removed. We want to see fast and cheap access to the Internet. Britain is now leading Europe in the new Internet economy. Looking at E-commerce trading, we are ahead of Germany and ahead of France. Four times the European average. Over one in six homes in Britain now have access to the Internet. A quarter of our businesses are online. Other areas, like Scandinavia, have seen remarkable growth too in communications technology and e-business. But Britain is undoubtedly doing well in the European E-league. But that is no reason for complacency. With a technological revolution on this scale, we have to try harder. We have to maintain and enhance our performance. That's why I've set the goal of Britain being the best place for e-commerce by 2002. We already have a bold programme for Internet access: \u0095 We will connect all our libraries and schools to the Internet by 2002 \u0095 We will have 1000 IT learning centres open by next year \u0095 We are leasing inexpensive refurbished computers to 100,000 of our poorest families \u0095 We are giving through learning accounts an 80% discount on the cost of basic IT courses But we want to do more. Because, the one clear lesson of the Internet is you can't stand still. We will get costs down, through competition. When we published our strategy for e-commerce in the autumn, we were told the key barrier was the cost of Internet calls. Americans used the Internet for longer, mainly because most of them don't pay a per-minute charge. Gordon Brown has challenged the industry to get internet access prices down.

Womit man selten rechnen darf: da\u00df ein deutscher Streifen die Kassen im Ausland klingeln l\u00e4\u00dft.</p> <p>Sicherlich, einige deutsche Schauspieler und Regisseure haben sich auch in anderen L\u00e4ndern einen Namen gemacht. J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, der mit \"Das Boot\" bekannt wurde, zum Beispiel. Oder Roland Emmerich, der mit \"Independence Day\" einen Angriff Au\u00dferirdischer filmische Wirklichkeit werden lie\u00df. Und dann w\u00e4re da noch Wim Wenders. Mit seinem neuesten Werk \"The Million Dollar Hotel\" gewann er auf der Berlinale den Silbernen B\u00e4ren. Und f\u00fcr \"Buena Vista Social Club\" wurde er jetzt auch f\u00fcr den Oscar nominiert.</p> <p>Dennoch haben es durch und durch deutsche Filme - Streifen deutscher Mache mit Schauspielern aus der Bundesrepublik - noch immer schwer im Ausland. </p> <p><strong> Wie ist Deiner Ansicht nach das Ansehen deutscher Filme im Ausland? </strong></p> <p><strong>Fred (16): </strong> Das ist nat\u00fcrlich schwer zu sagen, wenn man nicht im Ausland lebt. Ich habe allerdings noch kaum in Zeitungen gelesen, da\u00df Filme aus Deutschland woanders gro\u00dfes Aufsehen erregt h\u00e4tten. </p> <p> <strong> Ulrich (19): </strong> Ich habe einmal f\u00fcr ein halbes Jahr in Amerika gelebt. In den gro\u00dfen Kinos lief in dieser Zeit kein einziger Streifen, der in Deutschland oder in deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern entstanden ist. Nur ein ganz kleines Kino hat ab und zu Filme aus dem Ausland gezeigt. </p> <p> <strong> Lara (17): </strong> Deutsche Filme werden, glaube ich, von Fachleuten immer ziemlich zerpfl\u00fcckt. Mir scheint es manchmal, als w\u00e4ren sie da kritischer als zum Beispiel bei Hollywood-Schinken. Ich finde es schon komisch, wenn bei guten deutschen Filmen immer so getan wird, als w\u00e4re das etwas ganz besonderes. Warum sollten wir keine super Geschichten verfilmen k\u00f6nnen? </p> <p> <strong> Warum sind Filme, die in deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern entstehen, Eurer Ansicht nach so selten Kassenschlager im Ausland? </strong></p> <p><strong>Ulrich: </strong> Das liegt wohl an der Machart. Die meisten Filme, die in Amerika gemacht werden, richten sich nach dem Geschmack der breiten Masse. Ein bi\u00dfchen Action, ein bi\u00dfchen Sex, tolle Effekte. Die deutschsprachigen Werke sind oft tiefgr\u00fcndiger, man mu\u00df genauer aufpassen, um ihren Sinn zu verstehen. Das kommt nicht \u00fcberall an. </p> <p> <strong> Armin (17): </strong> Deutsche Filmemacher haben oft weniger Kohle, um ihre Arbeit zu vermarkten. Doch wenn man nicht laut genug trommelt, ist in dem Gesch\u00e4ft wohl nicht viel zu holen. Vor allem wenn da einer kommt, der noch nie einen guten Film gelandet hat, hat er's beim ersten Mal nat\u00fcrlich doppelt schwer. </p> <p> <strong> Lara: </strong> Vielleicht, weil bei uns nicht so ein Kult um Schauspieler gemacht wird. Hollywood zum Beispiel ist ja eine Welt f\u00fcr sich. Da wird jeder verg\u00f6ttert, der irgendwann einmal in einem Film mitgespielt hat. Bei uns finde ich das nicht so heftig. Aber wenn schon wir viele unserer eigenen Schauspieler nicht kennen, warum sollte man sie dann au\u00dferhalb der Grenzen kennen? </p> <p><strong> Wim Wenders hat auf der Berlinale den Silbernen B\u00e4ren gewonnen, jetzt ist einer seiner Filme f\u00fcr den Oscar nominiert. Was sagt ihr dazu?</strong> </p> <p><strong>Fred: </strong> Ich glaube, das k\u00f6nnte den Experten im Ausland wieder einmal beweisen, da\u00df ein deutschsprachiger Filmemacher auch tolle Ideen haben kann. Obwohl: Bei Wenders' neuestem Film spielt ja Mel Gibson eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Und der ist so bekannt, da\u00df wahrscheinlich eher sein Name zieht als der von Wenders. </p> <p> <strong> Lara: </strong> Ich finde das super. Ich habe da einen Bericht gelesen, da\u00df in Berlin sogar Bono von U2 und Naomi Campbell da waren, um Wenders' Film zu pr\u00e4sentieren. Das ist doch die beste Reklame: Zwei Leute, die jeder kennt, r\u00fchren die Werbetrommel f\u00fcr einen deutschen Filmemacher. </p> <p> <strong> Ulrich: </strong> Ich bef\u00fcrchte, da\u00df der Film zwar Erfolg haben wird, da\u00df viele ihn aber nicht als deutschen Film sehen werden. Er wurde in Amerika gedreht, mit Schauspielern, die nicht aus Deutschland stammen. Au\u00dferdem lebt Wenders ja auch in Amerika, auch wenn er viele seiner Streifen in Deutschland gedreht hat. </p> <p> <strong> Was haltet Ihr selbst von Kinofilmen, die nach deutscher Machart entstanden sind? </strong></p> <p><strong>Fred: </strong> Ich habe \"Lola rennt\" gesehen und den fand ich total scharf. Die Vermischung von realen Szenen und Zeichentrick hat mir gut gefallen. War au\u00dferdem eine neue Idee. </p> <p> <strong> Ulrich: </strong> \"Schtonk\" habe ich im Kino gesehen. Diesen Streifen mit G\u00f6tz George, in dem es um die gef\u00e4lschten Hitler-Tageb\u00fccher ging. Ich fand sowohl das Drehbuch als auch die Schauspieler hervorragend. Eine Sache, die wirklich passiert ist, wurde in diesem Streifen am\u00fcsant auf die Schippe genommen. Diesen Humor sch\u00e4tze ich. </p> <p> <strong> Armin: </strong> Was ich absolut dick habe, sind Emanzen-Filme. Solche, in denen die M\u00e4nner immer \u00fcbers Ohr gehauen werden. Doris D\u00f6rrie zum Beispiel finde ich darum nicht so toll. So'was w\u00fcrde ich mir aber auch nicht anschauen, wenn es in Hollywood entstanden w\u00e4re. </p> <p><strong>Glossar/Glossary</strong></p> <p><strong>es dick haben</strong> (coll) to be fed up with </p> <p><strong> jemanden \u00fcbers Ohr hauen</strong> to cheat, play a trick on someone </p> <p><strong> die Kassen klingeln lassen</strong> to earn a lot of money with, (literally: to make the cash tills ring) </p> <p><strong> landen</strong> (coll) to be successful with something, to land (contract etc) </p> <p><strong> die Mache</strong> the making of </p> <p><strong> scharf</strong> (coll.) very good, great </p> <p><strong> der Schinken</strong> (coll) very long film, (also: a book with many pages) </p> <p><strong> auf die Schippe nehmen</strong> (coll.) to mock something/someone </p> <p><strong> der Streifen</strong> the film </p> <p><strong> verg\u00f6ttern</strong> to worship, adore </p> <p><strong> die Werbetrommel r\u00fchren</strong> to advertise something </p> <p><strong> zerpfl\u00fccken</strong> to take to pieces, (coll.) to criticise</p>",

Womit man selten rechnen darf: da\u00df ein deutscher Streifen die Kassen im Ausland klingeln l\u00e4\u00dft. Sicherlich, einige deutsche Schauspieler und Regisseure haben sich auch in anderen L\u00e4ndern einen Namen gemacht. J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, der mit \"Das Boot\" bekannt wurde, zum Beispiel. Oder Roland Emmerich, der mit \"Independence Day\" einen Angriff Au\u00dferirdischer filmische Wirklichkeit werden lie\u00df. Und dann w\u00e4re da noch Wim Wenders. Mit seinem neuesten Werk \"The Million Dollar Hotel\" gewann er auf der Berlinale den Silbernen B\u00e4ren. Und f\u00fcr \"Buena Vista Social Club\" wurde er jetzt auch f\u00fcr den Oscar nominiert. Dennoch haben es durch und durch deutsche Filme - Streifen deutscher Mache mit Schauspielern aus der Bundesrepublik - noch immer schwer im Ausland. Wie ist Deiner Ansicht nach das Ansehen deutscher Filme im Ausland? Fred (16): Das ist nat\u00fcrlich schwer zu sagen, wenn man nicht im Ausland lebt. Ich habe allerdings noch kaum in Zeitungen gelesen, da\u00df Filme aus Deutschland woanders gro\u00dfes Aufsehen erregt h\u00e4tten. Ulrich (19): Ich habe einmal f\u00fcr ein halbes Jahr in Amerika gelebt. In den gro\u00dfen Kinos lief in dieser Zeit kein einziger Streifen, der in Deutschland oder in deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern entstanden ist. Nur ein ganz kleines Kino hat ab und zu Filme aus dem Ausland gezeigt. Lara (17): Deutsche Filme werden, glaube ich, von Fachleuten immer ziemlich zerpfl\u00fcckt. Mir scheint es manchmal, als w\u00e4ren sie da kritischer als zum Beispiel bei Hollywood-Schinken. Ich finde es schon komisch, wenn bei guten deutschen Filmen immer so getan wird, als w\u00e4re das etwas ganz besonderes. Warum sollten wir keine super Geschichten verfilmen k\u00f6nnen? Warum sind Filme, die in deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern entstehen, Eurer Ansicht nach so selten Kassenschlager im Ausland? Ulrich: Das liegt wohl an der Machart. Die meisten Filme, die in Amerika gemacht werden, richten sich nach dem Geschmack der breiten Masse. Ein bi\u00dfchen Action, ein bi\u00dfchen Sex, tolle Effekte. Die deutschsprachigen Werke sind oft tiefgr\u00fcndiger, man mu\u00df genauer aufpassen, um ihren Sinn zu verstehen. Das kommt nicht \u00fcberall an. Armin (17): Deutsche Filmemacher haben oft weniger Kohle, um ihre Arbeit zu vermarkten. Doch wenn man nicht laut genug trommelt, ist in dem Gesch\u00e4ft wohl nicht viel zu holen. Vor allem wenn da einer kommt, der noch nie einen guten Film gelandet hat, hat er's beim ersten Mal nat\u00fcrlich doppelt schwer. Lara: Vielleicht, weil bei uns nicht so ein Kult um Schauspieler gemacht wird. Hollywood zum Beispiel ist ja eine Welt f\u00fcr sich. Da wird jeder verg\u00f6ttert, der irgendwann einmal in einem Film mitgespielt hat. Bei uns finde ich das nicht so heftig. Aber wenn schon wir viele unserer eigenen Schauspieler nicht kennen, warum sollte man sie dann au\u00dferhalb der Grenzen kennen? Wim Wenders hat auf der Berlinale den Silbernen B\u00e4ren gewonnen, jetzt ist einer seiner Filme f\u00fcr den Oscar nominiert. Was sagt ihr dazu? Fred: Ich glaube, das k\u00f6nnte den Experten im Ausland wieder einmal beweisen, da\u00df ein deutschsprachiger Filmemacher auch tolle Ideen haben kann. Obwohl: Bei Wenders' neuestem Film spielt ja Mel Gibson eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Und der ist so bekannt, da\u00df wahrscheinlich eher sein Name zieht als der von Wenders. Lara: Ich finde das super. Ich habe da einen Bericht gelesen, da\u00df in Berlin sogar Bono von U2 und Naomi Campbell da waren, um Wenders' Film zu pr\u00e4sentieren. Das ist doch die beste Reklame: Zwei Leute, die jeder kennt, r\u00fchren die Werbetrommel f\u00fcr einen deutschen Filmemacher. Ulrich: Ich bef\u00fcrchte, da\u00df der Film zwar Erfolg haben wird, da\u00df viele ihn aber nicht als deutschen Film sehen werden. Er wurde in Amerika gedreht, mit Schauspielern, die nicht aus Deutschland stammen. Au\u00dferdem lebt Wenders ja auch in Amerika, auch wenn er viele seiner Streifen in Deutschland gedreht hat. Was haltet Ihr selbst von Kinofilmen, die nach deutscher Machart entstanden sind? Fred: Ich habe \"Lola rennt\" gesehen und den fand ich total scharf. Die Vermischung von realen Szenen und Zeichentrick hat mir gut gefallen. War au\u00dferdem eine neue Idee. Ulrich: \"Schtonk\" habe ich im Kino gesehen. Diesen Streifen mit G\u00f6tz George, in dem es um die gef\u00e4lschten Hitler-Tageb\u00fccher ging. Ich fand sowohl das Drehbuch als auch die Schauspieler hervorragend. Eine Sache, die wirklich passiert ist, wurde in diesem Streifen am\u00fcsant auf die Schippe genommen. Diesen Humor sch\u00e4tze ich. Armin: Was ich absolut dick habe, sind Emanzen-Filme. Solche, in denen die M\u00e4nner immer \u00fcbers Ohr gehauen werden. Doris D\u00f6rrie zum Beispiel finde ich darum nicht so toll. So'was w\u00fcrde ich mir aber auch nicht anschauen, wenn es in Hollywood entstanden w\u00e4re. Glossar/Glossary es dick haben (coll) to be fed up with jemanden \u00fcbers Ohr hauen to cheat, play a trick on someone die Kassen klingeln lassen to earn a lot of money with, (literally: to make the cash tills ring) landen (coll) to be successful with something, to land (contract etc) die Mache the making of scharf (coll.) very good, great der Schinken (coll) very long film, (also: a book with many pages) auf die Schippe nehmen (coll.) to mock something/someone der Streifen the film verg\u00f6ttern to worship, adore die Werbetrommel r\u00fchren to advertise something zerpfl\u00fccken to take to pieces, (coll.) to criticise",

      "body": "<p>Debbie Hockley is happy. Stephen Fleming and Chris Nevin have finally got the better of Australia, in the last match of the antipodean one-day clash. \"At least they won a match,\" she deadpans. But she can afford a wry smile. New Zealand women avenged a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Australia with a 5-0 demolition of England. </p> <p>Hockley, 37, made her international debut 21 years ago, and in February became the first woman to play 100 one-day internationals. The New Zealand board are cherishing those weary limbs - they have given her a (first-ever) part-time contract until next January. She also has to fit in her job as a physio in a Christchurch hospital.</p> <p>Health problems affected her decision to step down from the captaincy after leading New Zealand to victory in the Rosebowl Trophy against Australia last year. While still smarting from defeat, Belinda Clark, the Australian captain, said Hockley would be the first name on her team-sheet for a women's World XI. Greater admiration hath no Australian. </p> <p><strong>You've just played in your 100th one-day international - what's your secret? </strong></p> <p>First and foremost I really love the game, and have a burning desire for success. Once you have won a few games, winning becomes a drug. </p> <p><strong>Do you still enjoy playing as much now as you did when you made your debut in 1979?</strong></p> <p> I have probably enjoyed myself more over the last five or six years than I ever have. Experience counts for a hell of a lot and my contract with the Board has allowed me to work part-time. </p> <p><strong>How much longer will you play for?</strong></p> <p> I'm not sure. I was quite disappointed with my form against England [she was second in the averages], but I scored more runs against Australia than I've done for a long time. My goal is the World Cup and then I'll see how I go. </p> <p><strong>Do you think New Zealand's 5-0 victory over England was a fair result?</strong></p> <p> Yes. England's batting was pretty disappointing. They've got a pretty handy bowling line up though - Nicki Shaw, the quick, is an outstanding prospect. Their fielding too has vastly improved from 1996 and Jane Cassar had a good series behind the stumps. </p> <p><strong>What can England do to improve?</strong></p> <p> They need batsmen who can bat. Charlotte Edwards and Claire Taylor looked pretty handy but not many others stayed with them. </p> <p><strong>Did you fraternise much?</strong></p> <p> We had a barbecue after the game in Hamilton, and after the last match in Napier we had a fairly jovial night in an Irish bar. It must have been the best Tuesday night in the bar's history. We've always had a good social thing going with England. It is different with Australia. </p> <p><strong>Just how good are Australia?</strong></p> <p> There's no doubt they are the best side in the world at the moment, even though we underperformed against them this summer. They aren't unbeatable, but any other team will have to play pretty damn well to topple them. They are difficult customers and you have to admire them for that. It is tough out there. </p> <p><strong>Do the Australian women have the same attitude to winning as the men?</strong></p> <p> Yes, and there is nothing wrong with that. They are not very good losers and they were bruising from losing to us in the Rosebowl last year. They were always going to work damn hard to regain it, and their 3-0 victory over us this summer was pretty conclusive. </p> <p><strong>Who are New Zealand's main rivals for the World Cup? </strong></p> <p> I would look at Australia and India. India are always difficult customers and I get nervous playing them. They have good spin bowlers and some of their batsmen are very aggressive. If England work hard on their batting this summer, they too will have a chance. </p> <p><strong>Have there been many changes to the women's game during your career?</strong></p> <p> Lots. The style of play has changed a lot: it is much more athletic, aggressive and committed - lots of girls are making sliding saves now. And thanks to the amalgamation of women's cricket into the NZC in 1992, we now have training camps and more money. It is pretty phenomenal really. When I first started we had to make our own travelling uniform - cut from a pattern (my mum made mine) - and pay to go away. </p> <p><strong>Can you see women's cricket going professional?</strong></p> <p> I can't, because I don't think it will ever create enough revenue for players to be paid. But it will be interesting to see what happens five years down the road.</p> <p><strong>What size crowds do you get for your matches?</strong></p> <p> In small grounds we sometimes get a couple of thousand which makes a nice atmosphere, but it is nothing like the men's game.</p> <p><strong>How much media coverage do you get? </strong></p> <p> I think we do pretty well here, certainly far better than they do in Australia. It is probably because we have the whole of the New Zealand Board's marketing department behind us. </p> <p><strong>Do you have much to do with the men's team?</strong></p> <p> We don't often run into them but I've talked to Craig McMillan and Chris Cairns about batting. </p> <p><strong>What more do you want to achieve before you retire?</strong></p> <p> I had always wanted to make a hundred against Australia, which I managed this summer. And of course winning the World Cup would be pretty nice - I'm hoping it will be third time lucky for me. It could be the last big series I play in, so a win would be the icing on the cake. </p> <p><strong>Will you stay involved with cricket when you retire?</strong></p> <p> I'm not sure. I'll have to be a full-time physio again and I'll probably have a bit of a break from cricket for a while. Then maybe I'll get involved with coaching or management. But you need a good few years out of the game before you can do that. </p> <p><strong>What one thing in cricket has given you the greatest pleasure?</strong></p> <p> I have to say the camaraderie.

      "bodyText": "Debbie Hockley is happy. Stephen Fleming and Chris Nevin have finally got the better of Australia, in the last match of the antipodean one-day clash. \"At least they won a match,\" she deadpans. But she can afford a wry smile. New Zealand women avenged a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Australia with a 5-0 demolition of England. Hockley, 37, made her international debut 21 years ago, and in February became the first woman to play 100 one-day internationals. The New Zealand board are cherishing those weary limbs - they have given her a (first-ever) part-time contract until next January. She also has to fit in her job as a physio in a Christchurch hospital. Health problems affected her decision to step down from the captaincy after leading New Zealand to victory in the Rosebowl Trophy against Australia last year. While still smarting from defeat, Belinda Clark, the Australian captain, said Hockley would be the first name on her team-sheet for a women's World XI. Greater admiration hath no Australian. You've just played in your 100th one-day international - what's your secret? First and foremost I really love the game, and have a burning desire for success. Once you have won a few games, winning becomes a drug. Do you still enjoy playing as much now as you did when you made your debut in 1979? I have probably enjoyed myself more over the last five or six years than I ever have. Experience counts for a hell of a lot and my contract with the Board has allowed me to work part-time. How much longer will you play for? I'm not sure. I was quite disappointed with my form against England [she was second in the averages], but I scored more runs against Australia than I've done for a long time. My goal is the World Cup and then I'll see how I go. Do you think New Zealand's 5-0 victory over England was a fair result? Yes. England's batting was pretty disappointing. They've got a pretty handy bowling line up though - Nicki Shaw, the quick, is an outstanding prospect. Their fielding too has vastly improved from 1996 and Jane Cassar had a good series behind the stumps. What can England do to improve? They need batsmen who can bat. Charlotte Edwards and Claire Taylor looked pretty handy but not many others stayed with them. Did you fraternise much? We had a barbecue after the game in Hamilton, and after the last match in Napier we had a fairly jovial night in an Irish bar. It must have been the best Tuesday night in the bar's history. We've always had a good social thing going with England. It is different with Australia. Just how good are Australia? There's no doubt they are the best side in the world at the moment, even though we underperformed against them this summer. They aren't unbeatable, but any other team will have to play pretty damn well to topple them. They are difficult customers and you have to admire them for that. It is tough out there. Do the Australian women have the same attitude to winning as the men? Yes, and there is nothing wrong with that. They are not very good losers and they were bruising from losing to us in the Rosebowl last year. They were always going to work damn hard to regain it, and their 3-0 victory over us this summer was pretty conclusive. Who are New Zealand's main rivals for the World Cup? I would look at Australia and India. India are always difficult customers and I get nervous playing them. They have good spin bowlers and some of their batsmen are very aggressive. If England work hard on their batting this summer, they too will have a chance. Have there been many changes to the women's game during your career? Lots. The style of play has changed a lot: it is much more athletic, aggressive and committed - lots of girls are making sliding saves now. And thanks to the amalgamation of women's cricket into the NZC in 1992, we now have training camps and more money. It is pretty phenomenal really. When I first started we had to make our own travelling uniform - cut from a pattern (my mum made mine) - and pay to go away. Can you see women's cricket going professional? I can't, because I don't think it will ever create enough revenue for players to be paid. But it will be interesting to see what happens five years down the road. What size crowds do you get for your matches? In small grounds we sometimes get a couple of thousand which makes a nice atmosphere, but it is nothing like the men's game. How much media coverage do you get? I think we do pretty well here, certainly far better than they do in Australia. It is probably because we have the whole of the New Zealand Board's marketing department behind us. Do you have much to do with the men's team? We don't often run into them but I've talked to Craig McMillan and Chris Cairns about batting. What more do you want to achieve before you retire? I had always wanted to make a hundred against Australia, which I managed this summer. And of course winning the World Cup would be pretty nice - I'm hoping it will be third time lucky for me. It could be the last big series I play in, so a win would be the icing on the cake. Will you stay involved with cricket when you retire? I'm not sure. I'll have to be a full-time physio again and I'll probably have a bit of a break from cricket for a while. Then maybe I'll get involved with coaching or management. But you need a good few years out of the game before you can do that. What one thing in cricket has given you the greatest pleasure? I have to say the camaraderie. We've had good times and not such good times, but the games that we have won have been pretty sensational and I've made some fantastic friends. Which cricketers have you most admired? Ken Wadsworth, who played for New Zealand in the 1970s and who died tragically of cancer at 29, was a gutsy, fighting, determined cricketer who never, ever, gave up. Martin Crowe was pretty damn sensational and then there is Jan Brittin. I first saw her in 1984 - she was a really elegant, classy cricketer and I loved watching her bat, even when she was getting runs against us. Who have you learnt the most from?

I live about half a km from the sea in Sumner, Christchurch. I love the outdoor life here. I also love reading. At the moment I'm trying The Courtship Gift by Julie Parsons.

He draws a rough sketch on transparent paper (it looks like kitchen greaseproof paper) and then places it on a lightbox under the paper for the finished version. He can see the outline of the rough and the placing of the elements of the picture - but not too clearly. \"If you trace, it just dies. The lightbox is a technique for planning while not squeezing the spontaneity out of it. </p> <p>\"Some things are more critical than others, particularly gestures and expressions, which I get very concerned about. It is often something quite slight - wide eyes or eyebrows or what the hands are doing.\" </p> <p>Readers will be familiar with those crooked smiles or looks of bemusement that recur in his drawings. A lot of wise and amusing tips have gone into Drawing for the Artistically Undiscovered, a book that comes complete with pencils. </p> <p>The famous collaboration with Dahl began with the Enormous Crocodile and Revolting Rhymes. His sunny, optimistic approach was the perfect foil for Dahl's dark imaginings - the ghastly Twits who play cruel practical jokes on each other, the bestial giants in The BFG and the deliciously scary Witches. He says it was like acting. \"You have to discover things in yourself that you might not think you could or should have done. The Twits is quite dark and menacing in its way; I rather liked it for that reason. </p> <p>\"I think you can tolerate more in words than in pictures. You can say something and move on from it and you don't have to look at it every time. A good example is Three Blind Mice. I thought it would be interesting to draw it using different techniques with more or less blood. You could make it absolutely horrific if you wanted to,\" he chuckles. </p> <p>The early drawings of The BFG had him in boots and apron, as Dahl had described. But when he saw Blake's drawings, Dahl didn't like them. A couple of days later a large Norwegian sandal arrived in the post from Dahl (one of his own). Sandals were perfect for the rather earnest vegetarian giant. </p> <p>He is now halfway through a busy two-year term as Children's Laureate and is planning a party to celebrate. Excerpts from his 50 favourite children's books - the Laureate's Party - will appear in June. He has helped prepare the children's section of the British Library's exhibition Chapter and Verse, which opens this week. He is also choosing pictures for an exhibition at the National Gallery, opening in February 2001, called provisionally Tell Me a Picture, in which each painting tells, or at least suggests, a story. It is to be alphabetical: one artist per letter. \"That means it's me or Botticelli,\" he remarked to the organisers. Blake will be supplying the drawings for the foyer and the letters of the alphabet. </p> <p> Blake can't help drawing stories himself. On his table is a recently completed watercolour for a magazine for teachers: two children and a monkey cling to a horse's back as it gallops beneath stormy skies. The horse is a typical creation, determined but happy. </p> <p>A longtime francophile, Blake is currently working with a group of teachers in the Charente region, where he has a home, on a project to produce a book involving 1,500 children. The story revolves around two children in a flying boat, which gets them into difficult situations where they confront problems like bullying and pollution. The local children are contributing by suggesting colours, storylines and so on from which Blake will then, in his words, \"cook\" the book. They are getting used to the man with the strange waistcoat and the stranger accent. </p> <p>One of the principal influences on Blake is the 19th-century French artist and satirist Honor\u00e9 Daumier. Several of the original reviews to which Daumier contributed hang in his hallway. Characteristically, they are not his most savage political inventions but more subtle send-ups of the bourgeoisie he made when censorship prevented him from direct attacks. One of his stock characters, Monsieur Prudhomme, pops up in Blake's version of Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales, looking pompous as he delivers the moral \"Always keep a hold of nurse/For fear of finding something worse.\" </p> <p>George Cruikshank, another eminent 19th-century political cartoonist and a hero of Blake's, also turned to wry social commentary, including illustrations for Dickens's Sketches by Boz. </p> <p>Among more than 200 books Blake has worked on are Cervantes' Don Quixote and Cyrano de Bergerac's Voyages to the Moon and the Sun (clearly one his favourites) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

      "body": "<p>It is a well known fact that the things that make small children shriek with laughter all too often make their accompanying adults groan (especially if it's a knock knock joke). But some books make everyone giggle - and if it's <strong> Giggle Bugs</strong> by David A Carter (Simon and Schuster, \u00a36.99), the book will even giggle for you. </p> <p>Read the joke (and there are some stunningly good ones as well as the awesomely dreadful ones), press the button - and Abracadabra! - instant electronic hilarity. </p> <p>If you prefer to make up your own jokes, try <strong> Buzz Buzz Bumble Jelly</strong> (Scholastic, \u00a39.99). Nick Sharratt's clear bright pictures in zinging colours are instantly recognisable by even the smallest reader (Miaow! A tabby cat; Yippee! A wibbly wobbly jelly), but the real fun starts with the split pages. You can mix and match the top and bottom halves into all sorts of rib tickling combinations. </p> <p><strong> Shark-Mad Stanley </strong> (ticktock publishing, \u00a39.99) by Griff is even more educational because it tells you a lot about sharks - but it is also one of the funniest books I've read in ages. </p> <p>The stylish illustrations are a delight, and the information is delivered with wonderfully deadpan humour - \"Brain: A small brain leaves more room for teeth. Teeth: Some sharks have rows and rows of teeth, just in case some fall out.\" And there's a wealth of witty detail in the pictures - check out the ingredients in the Shark Food advertisement. Oh - and there's a free CD, too. </p> <p>There aren't any fish in <strong> Farmer Brown Goes Round and Round </strong> (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a39.99), but there are loads of farm animals in a whirlwind story of mixed identities. \"His cows oinked, The pigs moo'd, His sheep clucked, The cat coo'd.\" </p> <p>If you think you've heard this idea before think again; this is the best version, and there's a neat twist in the tail. Teri Sloat writes glorious read aloud rhyme, and Nadine Bernard Westcott deserves to be much better known. Her animals (especially when wearing Farmer Brown's checked underwear) kept all my testers in hysterics all the way through the story. </p> <p>So did <strong> Charlie the Chicken</strong>, a pop-up book for the very young (although I noticed older siblings cackling away merrily as well.) The words - minimal, but just right - are by Nick Denchfield, and the pictures of Charlie's big fat tummy and great big feet are by Ant Parker. </p> <p>It's a splendid example of how something very simple can also be very funny - and good enough to stand a lot of repetition. After the first reading there were squeals of delight at the anticipation of the big fold out at the end of the book - a great introduction to the excitement to be found in literature! (Macmillan, \u00a35.99). </p> <p>And, finally, there is <strong> A Squash and a Squeeze</strong> (Mammoth, \u00a34.99). First published in 1993, Julia Donaldson's rhyming version of an old folk tale has become a bit of a classic. Axel Scheffler's illustrations of the little old lady who thinks her house is too small make children laugh from the front cover on, and the chaos caused by the animals when they are invited into the house is almost too much for toddlers who are constantly exhorted to Tidy Up. </p> <p>A goat on the bed and a cow on the table tapping out a jig? My readers collapsed in heaps, and then had to have it read again. And again. </p> <p>\u0095 All books above are available at a discount from the CultureShop on 0800 3166 102 or by sending a cheque to Guardian CultureShop, 250 Western Avenue, London W3 6EE.

      "bodyText": "It is a well known fact that the things that make small children shriek with laughter all too often make their accompanying adults groan (especially if it's a knock knock joke). But some books make everyone giggle - and if it's Giggle Bugs by David A Carter (Simon and Schuster, \u00a36.99), the book will even giggle for you. Read the joke (and there are some stunningly good ones as well as the awesomely dreadful ones), press the button - and Abracadabra! - instant electronic hilarity. If you prefer to make up your own jokes, try Buzz Buzz Bumble Jelly (Scholastic, \u00a39.99). Nick Sharratt's clear bright pictures in zinging colours are instantly recognisable by even the smallest reader (Miaow! A tabby cat; Yippee! A wibbly wobbly jelly), but the real fun starts with the split pages. You can mix and match the top and bottom halves into all sorts of rib tickling combinations. Shark-Mad Stanley (ticktock publishing, \u00a39.99) by Griff is even more educational because it tells you a lot about sharks - but it is also one of the funniest books I've read in ages. The stylish illustrations are a delight, and the information is delivered with wonderfully deadpan humour - \"Brain: A small brain leaves more room for teeth. Teeth: Some sharks have rows and rows of teeth, just in case some fall out.\" And there's a wealth of witty detail in the pictures - check out the ingredients in the Shark Food advertisement. Oh - and there's a free CD, too. There aren't any fish in Farmer Brown Goes Round and Round (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a39.99), but there are loads of farm animals in a whirlwind story of mixed identities. \"His cows oinked, The pigs moo'd, His sheep clucked, The cat coo'd.\" If you think you've heard this idea before think again; this is the best version, and there's a neat twist in the tail. Teri Sloat writes glorious read aloud rhyme, and Nadine Bernard Westcott deserves to be much better known. Her animals (especially when wearing Farmer Brown's checked underwear) kept all my testers in hysterics all the way through the story. So did Charlie the Chicken, a pop-up book for the very young (although I noticed older siblings cackling away merrily as well.) The words - minimal, but just right - are by Nick Denchfield, and the pictures of Charlie's big fat tummy and great big feet are by Ant Parker. It's a splendid example of how something very simple can also be very funny - and good enough to stand a lot of repetition. After the first reading there were squeals of delight at the anticipation of the big fold out at the end of the book - a great introduction to the excitement to be found in literature! (Macmillan, \u00a35.99). And, finally, there is A Squash and a Squeeze (Mammoth, \u00a34.99). First published in 1993, Julia Donaldson's rhyming version of an old folk tale has become a bit of a classic. Axel Scheffler's illustrations of the little old lady who thinks her house is too small make children laugh from the front cover on, and the chaos caused by the animals when they are invited into the house is almost too much for toddlers who are constantly exhorted to Tidy Up. A goat on the bed and a cow on the table tapping out a jig? My readers collapsed in heaps, and then had to have it read again. And again. \u0095 All books above are available at a discount from the CultureShop on 0800 3166 102 or by sending a cheque to Guardian CultureShop, 250 Western Avenue, London W3 6EE.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Divorce can be very messy. In fact, few problems in David Blunkett's in-tray are proving knottier than the break-up with the Training and Enterprise Councils, or TECs. </p> <p>In 12 months, the 72 TECs in England plus six in Wales will cease getting government funding to the tune of almost \u00a31bn a year. </p> <p>Their goose was cooked a year ago. A critical review concluded that their performance as lightning conductors for retraining and for regional regeneration did not justify continued cash support from the Department for Education and Employment. </p> <p>Their fate was announced when Blunkett launched his plans for a complete shake-up of the organisation and delivery of post-16 education and training, and said that \"accountability, efficiency and probity should be promoted at every level\". </p> <p>The TECs' particular problem, the education secretary said in the white paper that preceded the learning and skills bill, was that each of them had different funding and administrative systems, with long chains of intermediaries tagging along. This had resulted in \"a bureaucratic minefield that is confusing, difficult to negotiate and often impedes rather than encourages the learner\". </p> <p>Which all, no doubt, adds to the current problem: how to uncouple the TECs from the public purse. </p> <p>No matter how diplomatically Blunkett approaches the task, this divorce will get messy. Already there is deep disagreement between him and the TEC bosses over who owns what and how the spoils should be divided. </p> <p>A lot is at stake - at the last count, at least \u00a3283m worth of accumulated surpluses across the country, mainly in the form of buildings and equipment bought with both public and private money, but also cash acquired through efficiency savings. </p> <p>In an uncomplicated world the assets and reserves generated by public funds would simply be returned to the education department. But TECs are pointing to \"non-attributable elements\" in their accounts and some maverick ones may refuse to cooperate. </p> <p>To make matters even worse, a number of powerful TEC bosses are taking legal advice and may challenge Blunkett in the courts over apparent anomalies in the process of winding down. </p> <p>The expectation is that about 5,500 of the total 9,500 people employed by all TECs will transfer to the new Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs), with 500 located at the central office. These will be middle and junior ranking staff. Senior officials in TECs that are closing will either have to apply for similar jobs in the LSCs or pocket a pay-off. </p> <p>Tim Boswell, the shadow further education minister, warns: \"We need to make sure some TECs don't blow all the money on extremely generous redundancy payments or a weekend in the Caribbean.\" </p> <p>The Tories, he recalls, faced similarly sticky problems over disputed assets when they cut further education colleges free from local authorities in 1993. </p> <p>Boswell, who has been asking searching questions about the issue in the Commons recently, added: \"There's considerable dispute over ownership. It is difficult to know what is private and what is public. So the potential for monkey business is enormous.\" </p> <p>He is also suspicious that Blunkett will try to seize assets gained by TECs' legitimate private operations. \"We need to know where any remaining private surplus should go. Certainly the government should not be allowed to collar it.\" </p> <p>Dr John Brennan, director of further education development at the Association of Colleges, points out that TECs have been legally obliged to distinguish between private and public monies in their accounts. \"But any accountant worth his or her salt will be creative with their accountancy,\" he says. </p> <p>TECs' limited company status means they can't just be closed down by the education department.

      "bodyText": "Divorce can be very messy. In fact, few problems in David Blunkett's in-tray are proving knottier than the break-up with the Training and Enterprise Councils, or TECs. In 12 months, the 72 TECs in England plus six in Wales will cease getting government funding to the tune of almost \u00a31bn a year. Their goose was cooked a year ago. A critical review concluded that their performance as lightning conductors for retraining and for regional regeneration did not justify continued cash support from the Department for Education and Employment. Their fate was announced when Blunkett launched his plans for a complete shake-up of the organisation and delivery of post-16 education and training, and said that \"accountability, efficiency and probity should be promoted at every level\". The TECs' particular problem, the education secretary said in the white paper that preceded the learning and skills bill, was that each of them had different funding and administrative systems, with long chains of intermediaries tagging along. This had resulted in \"a bureaucratic minefield that is confusing, difficult to negotiate and often impedes rather than encourages the learner\". Which all, no doubt, adds to the current problem: how to uncouple the TECs from the public purse. No matter how diplomatically Blunkett approaches the task, this divorce will get messy. Already there is deep disagreement between him and the TEC bosses over who owns what and how the spoils should be divided. A lot is at stake - at the last count, at least \u00a3283m worth of accumulated surpluses across the country, mainly in the form of buildings and equipment bought with both public and private money, but also cash acquired through efficiency savings. In an uncomplicated world the assets and reserves generated by public funds would simply be returned to the education department. But TECs are pointing to \"non-attributable elements\" in their accounts and some maverick ones may refuse to cooperate. To make matters even worse, a number of powerful TEC bosses are taking legal advice and may challenge Blunkett in the courts over apparent anomalies in the process of winding down. The expectation is that about 5,500 of the total 9,500 people employed by all TECs will transfer to the new Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs), with 500 located at the central office. These will be middle and junior ranking staff. Senior officials in TECs that are closing will either have to apply for similar jobs in the LSCs or pocket a pay-off. Tim Boswell, the shadow further education minister, warns: \"We need to make sure some TECs don't blow all the money on extremely generous redundancy payments or a weekend in the Caribbean.\" The Tories, he recalls, faced similarly sticky problems over disputed assets when they cut further education colleges free from local authorities in 1993. Boswell, who has been asking searching questions about the issue in the Commons recently, added: \"There's considerable dispute over ownership. It is difficult to know what is private and what is public. So the potential for monkey business is enormous.\" He is also suspicious that Blunkett will try to seize assets gained by TECs' legitimate private operations. \"We need to know where any remaining private surplus should go. Certainly the government should not be allowed to collar it.\" Dr John Brennan, director of further education development at the Association of Colleges, points out that TECs have been legally obliged to distinguish between private and public monies in their accounts. \"But any accountant worth his or her salt will be creative with their accountancy,\" he says. TECs' limited company status means they can't just be closed down by the education department. And not all the TECs plan to quietly fade away next spring. Many will transmogrify as slimmed-down, private-sector providers, ready to take their chance in the open market and compete for lucrative training contracts. Others might re-emerge in completely new clothes doing other things. Several have already merged with local chambers of commerce and Business Link, the Department of Trade and Industry scheme.

      "body": "<p>On December 10 last year, Paula Lewis was having an uneventful afternoon when a telephone call plunged her into 28 hours of chaos. Waddon Infant School in Croydon wanted her to get down to the nursery as soon as possible. There had been an accident. Harry, Paula's third child, was in \"a bit of a mess\". </p> <p>Paula bundled her baby into the car and got to the school in 10 minutes. </p> <p>\"He was sitting down,\" she said, \"I thought 'Oh, he's OK' but then he opened his mouth and the blood went everywhere. I was stunned.\" Harry had fallen over in the playground and smashed his teeth. Paula was advised to take him to St Helier's hospital in Carshalton. She loaded Harry and his brother Dale into her car and set off on a nightmare journey through traffic. </p> <p>\"I was hysterical, crying, trying to drive the car. Harry's crying, he's still bleeding and Dale is asking what on earth has happened to his brother.\" Paula's arrival at hospital didn't end her problems. St Helier's couldn't treat Harry. One tooth was gone, four others would need to be extracted and there was damage to the mouth and gums. </p> <p>Harry would need a general anaesthetic and a bed. He was transferred across London, ending up at St George's in Tooting, where he was operated on the next morning. </p> <p>Like many parents, Paula thought her children were safe at school. \"The only time my children are not with me is when they're at school,\" she says. But the facts are that school is the place where children are most likely to suffer a non-fatal injury, and that the true situation across the country is unknown, because no one collects the figures. </p> <p>Details of work-based accidents are held by the Health and Safety Executive, which has the main responsibility for enforcing safety legislation. Unfortunately, as a recent parliamentary select committee discovered, the executive is grossly under-resourced and only investigates a proportion of the most serious cases. </p> <p>MPs on the commons environment select committee were told that the HSE investigates 6% of accidents. Jenny Bacon, head of the HSE, told MPs: \"We do not intend to investigate every accident, only those where there is a substantial breach.\" This policy leaves schools largely unvisited by HSE inspectors. Schools have few deaths and are categorised as low risk by the HSE. </p> <p>But, even when compared with similar low-risk employment sectors, schools have a higher rate of accidents. The figures, which relate to teachers' accidents and include colleges and universities, show that education premises are more dangerous than shops and garages, hotels and restaurants, and the health sector. Education has a rate more than double that for small offices and five times the rate for bank. </p> <p>But schoolchildren aren't employees and lie outside the HSE's area of responsibility. Accidents only have to be reported if an ambulance takes an injured child to hospital and in the statistics they are included with all other visitors to the building - along with trespassers, parents, contractors and Ofsted inspectors.

      "bodyText": "On December 10 last year, Paula Lewis was having an uneventful afternoon when a telephone call plunged her into 28 hours of chaos. Waddon Infant School in Croydon wanted her to get down to the nursery as soon as possible. There had been an accident. Harry, Paula's third child, was in \"a bit of a mess\". Paula bundled her baby into the car and got to the school in 10 minutes. \"He was sitting down,\" she said, \"I thought 'Oh, he's OK' but then he opened his mouth and the blood went everywhere. I was stunned.\" Harry had fallen over in the playground and smashed his teeth. Paula was advised to take him to St Helier's hospital in Carshalton. She loaded Harry and his brother Dale into her car and set off on a nightmare journey through traffic. \"I was hysterical, crying, trying to drive the car. Harry's crying, he's still bleeding and Dale is asking what on earth has happened to his brother.\" Paula's arrival at hospital didn't end her problems. St Helier's couldn't treat Harry. One tooth was gone, four others would need to be extracted and there was damage to the mouth and gums. Harry would need a general anaesthetic and a bed. He was transferred across London, ending up at St George's in Tooting, where he was operated on the next morning. Like many parents, Paula thought her children were safe at school. \"The only time my children are not with me is when they're at school,\" she says. But the facts are that school is the place where children are most likely to suffer a non-fatal injury, and that the true situation across the country is unknown, because no one collects the figures. Details of work-based accidents are held by the Health and Safety Executive, which has the main responsibility for enforcing safety legislation. Unfortunately, as a recent parliamentary select committee discovered, the executive is grossly under-resourced and only investigates a proportion of the most serious cases. MPs on the commons environment select committee were told that the HSE investigates 6% of accidents. Jenny Bacon, head of the HSE, told MPs: \"We do not intend to investigate every accident, only those where there is a substantial breach.\" This policy leaves schools largely unvisited by HSE inspectors. Schools have few deaths and are categorised as low risk by the HSE. But, even when compared with similar low-risk employment sectors, schools have a higher rate of accidents. The figures, which relate to teachers' accidents and include colleges and universities, show that education premises are more dangerous than shops and garages, hotels and restaurants, and the health sector. Education has a rate more than double that for small offices and five times the rate for bank. But schoolchildren aren't employees and lie outside the HSE's area of responsibility. Accidents only have to be reported if an ambulance takes an injured child to hospital and in the statistics they are included with all other visitors to the building - along with trespassers, parents, contractors and Ofsted inspectors. Those inspectors do have a brief to report on health and safety issues and in this year's annual report, Chris Woodhead drew attention to inspectors' concerns about health and safety. In over a quarter of secondary schools, inspectors identified health and safety issues and in one in 10 there were \"a significant number of such problems\". More than a quarter of schools are failing to carry out the regular risk assessment procedures which experts argue are essential for accident prevention. Ofsted does not collate statistics of injuries, nor does the organisation have any formal liaison channel with the HSE or with other safety authorities to pass on concerns about a particular school. A spokesperson claimed that concerns would be passed on to the appropriate authority, but the Guardian has been unable to identify any instances when this has happened. In its annual report, the HSE gives a figure of 9,238 accidents to members of the public on school premises. This represents just 0.2 accidents per school per year.

As it happens, the format and content for the new Foundation degrees is rather different, but I'm not advocating a particular solution here, just making the point that labels do matter. They certainly matter to the learner. In the real world, nothing is quite so straightforward (or important) as their results. Success or failure, ticks in boxes, marks-out-of-ten, assessments and grades. Qualifications count. So should we be trying to make these new offerings synonymous with further education colleges? Or must we be more fatalistic, and see our role simply as the delivery mechanism for qualifications which have been endorsed by employers? (And will these eventually be proprietary commercial products: MS Office 2010, and the like?) I think not. I am unreservedly positive about all this. The government is re-branding learning and linking it to skills for employment as never before. David Blunkett has delivered the cash. And taxi drivers still know where the Tech is, even if educationalists don't. What all this says to me is that we need to rediscover vocational education. And make it central to the mission of colleges in the new Learning &amp; Skills world. It's time we lost the identity crisis, folks. Back to the future!",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Allowing universities to control the number of students they recruit and the tuition fees they charge would deepen the educational divide between the rich and poor, officials have warned, as the debate intensifies over the future funding of the academic sector. University heads last week decided to commission a wide-ranging study of funding \"taking account of\" the Russell group work on differential fees. After meeting in private in Edinburgh, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said: \"The study will consider the implications of various funding options for students and their families, for universities and the higher education sector as a whole.\" </p> <p>Ensuring that students from underprivileged backgrounds are not excluded from top universities has emerged as the key issue in the radical funding reforms being considered by the 20 elite academic heads known as the Russell group. The proposals, which include deregulating tuition fees and allocating core government teaching grants through open competition, prompted some fierce exchanges behind the scenes among vice-chancellors as they gathered for their residential meeting last week. </p> <p>One funding council official argued that a free-for-all competition for student numbers and fees would send the university sector on a spiralling path towards further ghettoization, with social backgrounds determining where students enrol for degrees. </p> <p>\"It is no surprise at all that the Russell group would argue for this as they will be sitting pretty,\" he said. \"It will enable them to charge what they like and take as many students as they like. But you end up exposing the other end of the market - the further-education colleges and access-oriented former polytechnics currently struggling to fill student places. They are the ones who are going to have to find ways to fill places by offering discounts. It just reinforces the whole divide.\" </p> <p>Yet the Russell-group heads have stressed that the funding schemes being investigated by a group of academic economists have both financial and social goals: they aim to solve the funding crisis in universities, but also improve the low uptake of poor students on degree courses. The proposals are unlikely to retain the backing of the prime minister's policy advisers if they fail to produce a system where academic talent is rewarded irrespective of students' backgrounds. </p> <p>Sir Brian Follett, vice-chancellor of the University of Warwick, said: \"The economists will undertake a detailed appraisal of these and the practical implications of how you put them into place, and the social consequences of putting them in place. The only system acceptable would be one that guaranteed access to higher education for all students, regardless of circumstances.\" </p> <p>Few disagree that the current funding arrangements for universities are failing on all fronts. Chancellor Gordon Brown is convinced that universities are the breeding ground for high-tech businesses generating money and jobs in the future. </p> <p> Yet a survey published by university heads last week highlights growing problems in filling poorly paid academic posts. In terms of the gross domestic product, the UK lags far behind other western countries in government support for universities. And academic institutions remain shackled by government controls over the teaching income they can generate. </p> <p>The government has unveiled apparently ambitious targets to expand the numbers benefiting from post-school education.

      "bodyText": "Allowing universities to control the number of students they recruit and the tuition fees they charge would deepen the educational divide between the rich and poor, officials have warned, as the debate intensifies over the future funding of the academic sector. University heads last week decided to commission a wide-ranging study of funding \"taking account of\" the Russell group work on differential fees. After meeting in private in Edinburgh, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said: \"The study will consider the implications of various funding options for students and their families, for universities and the higher education sector as a whole.\" Ensuring that students from underprivileged backgrounds are not excluded from top universities has emerged as the key issue in the radical funding reforms being considered by the 20 elite academic heads known as the Russell group. The proposals, which include deregulating tuition fees and allocating core government teaching grants through open competition, prompted some fierce exchanges behind the scenes among vice-chancellors as they gathered for their residential meeting last week. One funding council official argued that a free-for-all competition for student numbers and fees would send the university sector on a spiralling path towards further ghettoization, with social backgrounds determining where students enrol for degrees. \"It is no surprise at all that the Russell group would argue for this as they will be sitting pretty,\" he said. \"It will enable them to charge what they like and take as many students as they like. But you end up exposing the other end of the market - the further-education colleges and access-oriented former polytechnics currently struggling to fill student places. They are the ones who are going to have to find ways to fill places by offering discounts. It just reinforces the whole divide.\" Yet the Russell-group heads have stressed that the funding schemes being investigated by a group of academic economists have both financial and social goals: they aim to solve the funding crisis in universities, but also improve the low uptake of poor students on degree courses. The proposals are unlikely to retain the backing of the prime minister's policy advisers if they fail to produce a system where academic talent is rewarded irrespective of students' backgrounds. Sir Brian Follett, vice-chancellor of the University of Warwick, said: \"The economists will undertake a detailed appraisal of these and the practical implications of how you put them into place, and the social consequences of putting them in place. The only system acceptable would be one that guaranteed access to higher education for all students, regardless of circumstances.\" Few disagree that the current funding arrangements for universities are failing on all fronts. Chancellor Gordon Brown is convinced that universities are the breeding ground for high-tech businesses generating money and jobs in the future. Yet a survey published by university heads last week highlights growing problems in filling poorly paid academic posts. In terms of the gross domestic product, the UK lags far behind other western countries in government support for universities. And academic institutions remain shackled by government controls over the teaching income they can generate. The government has unveiled apparently ambitious targets to expand the numbers benefiting from post-school education. Yet its abolition of maintenance grants , against the wishes of the Dearing review, means degrees are likely to remain the preserve for the middle classes. This is why there are plans to reintroduce bursaries and delay fee payments north of the border. Universities represent a system where society as a whole subsidises the rich, ensuring that they secure the best paid jobs. If graduates enjoy lifelong financial returns for their university education, why shouldn't they pay for the privilege? The problem facing economists who draw on the US experience of charging fees is that UK universities do not have the multi-billion endowments and alumni donations associated with the top Ivy League institutions. The most likely models for Russell group universities are Ivy League institutions such as Cornell, funded by state and private funds. Yet even with their reserves, and claims that student admissions are \"need blind\", Ivy League enrolments are dominated by white middle-class Americans. So much so that a row now rages over \"affirmative action\" - schemes exclusively geared to recruit other ethnic groups.

But, will the biotech boom benefit Oxford's financially struggling students? </p> <p>John Clements, the university's director of finance, says: \"That's a very difficult question to answer. There isn't a direct link between a particular source of money at one end and specific spending at the other. The whole university community will benefit, though.\" </p> <p>The most likely course of action would be for some of the proceeds to be put into an endowment fund, with the interest used to support students. The value of the shares is significant for the university's finances - the institution's income last year was \u00a3319m. The government's efforts to end special treatment for Oxbridge has meant a squeeze on funding. So much so that Cambridge is green with envy. Richard Jennings, of Cambridge University's industrial liaison office, says: \"None of the companies we've set up here have floated yet. We'd certainly like them to.\" </p> <p>The closest yet is Cambridge Display Technology, which makes innovative light-emitting devices which could replace the technology in television sets. The business has just been through a refinancing valuing it at \u00a381m. </p> <p>\"It's probably worth much more than that,\" says Mr Jennings. \"If there was a public offering, we would consider realising some value.\" </p> <p>The boom looks set to continue - hi-tech biotechs have replaced \"dot.com\" companies as targets for many small investors. Just yesterday, the value of Oxford university's shares increased by nearly \u00a33m, as the drugs sector surged further. Enough to fund a few more library books, surely? Dr Hayes is yet to be convinced that it is time to take profits. \"Not in the short term,\" he says. \"We will treat these shares just like any other investment organisation would, though.\" If the university's portfolio keeps soaring, he may find it hard to resist the temptation to get out at the top.</p>",

The proceeds from any share disposal would be split three ways. Some would go to the department in which the company originated, some would fund more technology transfer programmes and the rest would go into the university's central funds. But, will the biotech boom benefit Oxford's financially struggling students? John Clements, the university's director of finance, says: \"That's a very difficult question to answer. There isn't a direct link between a particular source of money at one end and specific spending at the other. The whole university community will benefit, though.\" The most likely course of action would be for some of the proceeds to be put into an endowment fund, with the interest used to support students. The value of the shares is significant for the university's finances - the institution's income last year was \u00a3319m. The government's efforts to end special treatment for Oxbridge has meant a squeeze on funding. So much so that Cambridge is green with envy. Richard Jennings, of Cambridge University's industrial liaison office, says: \"None of the companies we've set up here have floated yet. We'd certainly like them to.\" The closest yet is Cambridge Display Technology, which makes innovative light-emitting devices which could replace the technology in television sets. The business has just been through a refinancing valuing it at \u00a381m. \"It's probably worth much more than that,\" says Mr Jennings. \"If there was a public offering, we would consider realising some value.\" The boom looks set to continue - hi-tech biotechs have replaced \"dot.com\" companies as targets for many small investors. Just yesterday, the value of Oxford university's shares increased by nearly \u00a33m, as the drugs sector surged further. Enough to fund a few more library books, surely? Dr Hayes is yet to be convinced that it is time to take profits. \"Not in the short term,\" he says. \"We will treat these shares just like any other investment organisation would, though.\" If the university's portfolio keeps soaring, he may find it hard to resist the temptation to get out at the top.",

      "bodyText": "Stephen Byers is poised to order an official Whitehall inquiry into British American Tobacco's exploitation of cigarette smuggling around the globe. The trade secretary is preparing to send inspectors into the company to investigate growing evidence that the London-based firm knowingly supplied smugglers. Mr Byers is ready to send in a department of trade and industry (DTI) inspection team if a Commons health select committee report recommends the investigation. A senior source in his department said last night: \"We've always suspected this is what they were up to. If there's a clear recommendation from the select committee, then the DTI will act on that. The recommendation would be the trigger.\" The secretary of state has the power to order an inquiry into the role of BAT's directors under section 432 of the 1985 companies act. Inspectors can be asked to look at allegations of suspected fraud or misconduct or evidence that shareholders have been denied information they could have reasonably expected to receive. The threat of a DTI investigation hangs over BAT, the world's second biggest tobacco company, selling 900m cigarettes a year, after the Guardian disclosed how it exploited smuggling in Latin America and Asia. Mr Byers signalled his readiness to act in a letter to Clive Bates, director of Ash, the anti-smoking group. \"As you will be aware, this matter is now under consideration by the health select committee. \"I feel that it's appropriate that I should wait for their report and recommendations before deciding what action my department should take,\" Mr Byers wrote. MPs on the health select committee will consider proposing an inquiry this Thursday after a bad-tempered hearing with Martin Broughton, BAT's chairman, and Kenneth Clarke, the company's deputy chairman. Mr Broughton angered members by ripping up evidence and dismissing the session as a \"kangaroo court\" while Mr Clarke, a former Tory chancellor, claimed he had not read crucial documents despite giving the firm a clean bill of health. Detailed evidence of BAT's involvement in smuggling was discovered in company documents lodged in its Guildford depository as part of the settlement to a US court case. BAT has already been forced to initiate an internal probe headed by Rupert Pennant-Rea, chairman of the company's audit committee and a former deputy governor of the Bank of England. The firm is signed up to the Turnbull Code on good corporate governance and Mr Pennant-Rea is expected to make an interim statement at the firm's annual meeting on April 27. A BAT spokesman said it would not speculate on the health select committee's conclusions or possible DTI action. \"We have had no indication from them. I would not want to comment publicly on the DTI,\" he said. A DTI inquiry would be highly embarrassing for BAT and might only be avoided if the all-party Commons committee fails to agree a unanimous report. The two Conservative members will be under intense pressure not to back an inquiry into a company which employs Mr Clarke as a director. Mr Bates, of Ash, who also gave evidence to the health committee, said: \"Whether you think BAT are innocent or guilty, the right way to get an independent assessment of the evidence is for DTI inspectors to go through it with a fine tooth comb. \"I cannot imagine that anyone concerned about high standards of corporate conduct and governance would want anything other than a proper DTI investigation to clear BAT's name or throw the book at them.\"",

In the latest embarrassing setback for Moscow, which claims that it has won the war, the reports yesterday from the north-western Russian town of Pskov - home to the elite 76th airborne guards division - said that between 60 and 80 paratroops were killed in fighting in the Argun gorge. The news came as 20 Russian police, killed in a Chechen ambush on a convoy outside Grozny last week, were buried outside Moscow. The threat posed by the rebel hit-and-run tactics caused the government yesterday to call off two trips to Chechnya by Russian and international human rights monitors. General Gennady Troshev, a Russian commander in Chechnya, admitted on Sunday that 31 paratroops were killed in the Argun gorge in battles near the villages of Ulus-Kurt and Selmentausen. \"We couldn't avoid casualties,\" he said. But yesterday Russian television and newspapers said at least 60 paratroopers had died in the fighting early last Friday. An officer in the Pskov division did not deny the higher figures.

What other explanation could there be for any Labour party member consistently refusing to be bound by the Labour manifesto? Ken has never been a team player, and his self-interest comes before that of the government or the Labour party. It's why those of us who know him don't trust him.</p> <p>Clive Soley MP <br> Chairman, Labour party London selection board</p> <p>\u0095 Those of us who argued with sceptical comrades that a Livingstone candidacy was always three parts opportunism and one part martyrology, ought, I suppose, to be glad that he has lived down to our expectations. However the decision he has taken will do both London and Labour grievous harm; many hands have contributed to this but it has taken one individual finally to bring it about.</p> <p>Phillip Whitehead MEP<br> Derby</p> <p>\u0095 Yesterday Frank Dobson said: \"It is quite usual for the Labour prime minister to support the Labour candidate\". However, Mr Blair actively campaigned against Ken Livingstone when he was seeking to be the official Labour candidate and this alone should justify his now standing as an independent candidate, irrespective of any assurances he may have given.</p> <p>Many of the \"weighted\" votes that helped to ensure Mr Dobson's selection will not have a vote in the mayoral election, whereas the majority of the party members have already defied Mr Blair and the party heirarchy by voting for Mr Livingstone.</p> <p>Simon Kahn<br> Lewes, East Sussex. <a href=\" simon@bitsandpieces.co.uk\"> simon@bitsandpieces.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Margaret McDonagh (Letters, March 6) claims that the Labour party \"elected Frank Dobson\". As I understand, Frank Dobson won with 22,000 votes, Ken Livingstone lost with 74,000 votes. It would seem that the Labour party elected Ken Livingstone. Tony Blair elected Frank Dobson.</p> <p>Liverpool<br> Ian Cracknell <a href=\"mailto: icracknell@hotmail.com\">icracknell@hotmail.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 Alan Millington (Letters, March 6) was not quite right about Leyton in 1964. As an active member of Leyton Labour party I was instrumental in the invitation to Patrick Gordon Walker and the recommendation that our much loved Reg (not Joe) Sorensen be ennobled - his general election majority had been less than 8,000, not 20,000. Patrick, who had lost his Midlands seat in a disgraceful racist campaign, proved to be a good constituency MP.</p> <p>Dick Drew <br> Bristol <a href=\"mailto:DickDrew@aol.com\">DickDrew@aol.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 So, Red Ken is going for it. I wonder how the mandarins of Millbank will manage to stitch this election up. Blair is finally under real pressure.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 At the time I interviewed Ken Livingstone for the mayoral shortlist I thought that he would stand as independent if he didn't win the party's internal ballot. What other explanation could there be for any Labour party member consistently refusing to be bound by the Labour manifesto? Ken has never been a team player, and his self-interest comes before that of the government or the Labour party. It's why those of us who know him don't trust him. Clive Soley MP Chairman, Labour party London selection board \u0095 Those of us who argued with sceptical comrades that a Livingstone candidacy was always three parts opportunism and one part martyrology, ought, I suppose, to be glad that he has lived down to our expectations. However the decision he has taken will do both London and Labour grievous harm; many hands have contributed to this but it has taken one individual finally to bring it about. Phillip Whitehead MEP Derby \u0095 Yesterday Frank Dobson said: \"It is quite usual for the Labour prime minister to support the Labour candidate\". However, Mr Blair actively campaigned against Ken Livingstone when he was seeking to be the official Labour candidate and this alone should justify his now standing as an independent candidate, irrespective of any assurances he may have given. Many of the \"weighted\" votes that helped to ensure Mr Dobson's selection will not have a vote in the mayoral election, whereas the majority of the party members have already defied Mr Blair and the party heirarchy by voting for Mr Livingstone. Simon Kahn Lewes, East Sussex. simon@bitsandpieces.co.uk \u0095 Margaret McDonagh (Letters, March 6) claims that the Labour party \"elected Frank Dobson\". As I understand, Frank Dobson won with 22,000 votes, Ken Livingstone lost with 74,000 votes. It would seem that the Labour party elected Ken Livingstone. Tony Blair elected Frank Dobson. Liverpool Ian Cracknell icracknell@hotmail.com \u0095 Alan Millington (Letters, March 6) was not quite right about Leyton in 1964. As an active member of Leyton Labour party I was instrumental in the invitation to Patrick Gordon Walker and the recommendation that our much loved Reg (not Joe) Sorensen be ennobled - his general election majority had been less than 8,000, not 20,000. Patrick, who had lost his Midlands seat in a disgraceful racist campaign, proved to be a good constituency MP. Dick Drew Bristol DickDrew@aol.com \u0095 So, Red Ken is going for it. I wonder how the mandarins of Millbank will manage to stitch this election up. Blair is finally under real pressure. Nancy Reagan said a woman is like a teabag, you only find out how strong she is when she's plunged into hot water. So, what kind of a teabag are you, Tony? Laura Marcus Leek, Staffs Lawls@compuserve.com \u0095 As the word \"mayor\" is likely to be on many people's lips for a while, may I request that it emerge disyllabically? If Mr Dobson were to win, it would unbearable to hear him called \"Dobbo\" and the \"mare\" of London. Michael Bulley Ashford, Kent michael@ashford.hi-net.co.uk \u0095 I have one thing to say to \"splitter\" Livingstone: \"Ooh you dismay me!\" Paul Sceeny Brackley, Northants psceeny@hotmail.com",

And the \"martyrs\" will be deemed by those who take Israel and the SLA's place to have been traitors, not patriots.</p> <p>The pull-out will transform the lives of the region's 100,000 inhabitants, most drastically those who collaborated with the Israelis. Several thousand people - SLA soldiers, and those who work in Israel or do business with it - have already been condemned in absentia by Lebanese courts. Israel has become the bulwark of the local economy. For many families, to be in its employ has been the only alternative to emigration or abject poverty. Those with a vested interest in the status quo do not want Israel to leave. Others simply do not believe it will withdraw.</p> <p>A local journalist, Ali Dia, said a withdrawal would occur only if there was a peace agreement between Israel and Syria. \"Without one it will be just too dangerous for [Ehud]Barak,\" the Israeli prime minister.</p> <p>Yesterday, as Israel continued its fourth consecutive day of air raids on targets north of the zone in reprisal for Hizbullah attacks, there was no sign of impending withdrawal. And \"no sign that Israel has begun bolstering its border positions, as distinct from those inside Lebanese territory,\" said officers serving with the oldest United Nations peacekeeping operation.</p> <p>On the contrary, the Israelis have bolstered their positions in south Lebanon. The latest refinement is wire netting draped around their perimeters; this is supposed to fend off the anti-tank missiles which Hizbullah has recently made very successful use of. Israeli soldiers in their bunkers can see and fire through the netting.</p> <p>\"But you wouldn't necessarily see any advance preparations [for a pull-out],\" said Major Herv\u00e9 Collet of France. \"They could be out within three days if they leave their equipment behind.\"</p> <p>But what Israel does about its SLA allies is a far trickier question: that does require advance planning.</p> <p>Like Mr Barak, the SLA commanders cling to the hope that it will be a withdrawal by agreement. \"They tell us that there is nothing to worry about,\" said an SLA spokesman, Raymond Abu Mrad. \"But without an agreement it will be very bad for us, Lebanon, and the region.\"</p> <p>For Israel to withdraw unilaterally would seem to make nonsense of the whole rationale which the security zone has embodied - to keep hostile forces away from the international border.</p> <p>But the conditions on which it hopes to extricate itself from the so-called Lebanese mud have eroded drastically over the years. A UN peacekeeping officer said: \"I believe Barak would be content with just a piece of paper from the Lebanese government guaranteeing the security of the frontier; then, with any violation of it, he would feel free to flatten Lebanon.\"</p> <p>But, in the absence of wider agreement, Mr Barak is most unlikely to get this. There is no assurance that Lebanon would even send its army up to the frontier. It has not deployed in the Jezzin salient, from which the SLA withdrew last summer. And a Damascus newspaper, Tishreen, warned yesterday that the withdrawal decision \"contains the seeds of war in the entire region\".</p> <p>It is Hizbullah's stated policy not to compete with the state in any evacuated areas. But state or no state, there would seem to be nothing to stop it from blending into the local population wherever it pleases - such as in the Shi'ite villages of Kfar Kela, almost within shouting distance of the Israeli settlement of Metullah.</p> <p>Whatever the strategic risk Israel would be running, its soldiers would be getting out of their Lebanese hell-hole. But the SLA members have nowhere to go, except for their senior commanders, security men and prison administrators of ill repute. It is assumed that Israel would arrange a haven for those, perhaps 150 in all, who would face severe reprisals if they stayed behind.</p> <p>The SLA's commander, General Antoine Lahd, sentenced to death by Beirut, now spends as much time in France as in command of his troops. \"He's made his pile from all the taxes and duties he levies and can't wait to enjoy it,\" said a local businessman.</p> <p>\"God knows what will happen to us,\" said an official at the Kfar Tibnit crossing-point between the Israeli-occupied zone and sovereign Lebanon. He reflected the fears of all the rank and file, now plagued by demoralising, sometimes very improbable, rumours. The latest of them, from an Israel newspaper, is that they and their families will be shipped en masse to Turkish Cyprus.</p> <p>The fate of the SLA, and its reaction, is what raises the greatest fears among the local population.</p> <p>\"We shall never let Hizbullah come here,\" said Mr Abu Mrad. \"And have we been fighting and dying for 25 years, just to be packed off to exile? If the Israelis leave just like that, Gen Lahd couldn't ensure that his men obey him.\"</p> <p>That was a broad hint at the dangerous state of mind which most people here agree would take possession of the SLA if it felt itself abandoned. Resentment would run deep, not only against Syria and Hizbullah, but even more against Israel.</p> <p>Much of the SLA's rank and file, mainly Shi'ites, would probably offer themselves to Hizbullah, if they have not already secretly done so. Others, especially Christians, might refuse to disband.</p> <p>\"My fear is that the SLA will disintegrate, but not completely,\" said a leading resident of Merjayoun. It would, he said, be like the start of the Lebanese civil war all over again, with warlords staking out fiefdoms close to Israel's frontier. And they could be a very wild card indeed.</p> <p>It is a very high-stake diplomatic poker game that Syria and Israel are now playing out over south Lebanon. Of the local players, the SLA has less independence of Israel than Hizbullah does of Syria and Iran. But if ever the puppets had a chance to dictate to the puppet-masters, in the interests of each other, it is now, as the game moves towards its climax.</p> <p>Hizbullah - and in the absence of an agreement, Syria - would like nothing more than for the SLA to force Israel to retain a presence, however limited, in Lebanon.</p> <p>\"We doubt very much that Israel will withdraw completely,\" said the Hizbullah's second-in-command, Sheikh Naim Kassem last week. \"And so Hizbullah will fight on.\"</p>",

Israel has become the bulwark of the local economy. For many families, to be in its employ has been the only alternative to emigration or abject poverty. Those with a vested interest in the status quo do not want Israel to leave. Others simply do not believe it will withdraw. A local journalist, Ali Dia, said a withdrawal would occur only if there was a peace agreement between Israel and Syria. \"Without one it will be just too dangerous for [Ehud]Barak,\" the Israeli prime minister. Yesterday, as Israel continued its fourth consecutive day of air raids on targets north of the zone in reprisal for Hizbullah attacks, there was no sign of impending withdrawal. And \"no sign that Israel has begun bolstering its border positions, as distinct from those inside Lebanese territory,\" said officers serving with the oldest United Nations peacekeeping operation. On the contrary, the Israelis have bolstered their positions in south Lebanon. The latest refinement is wire netting draped around their perimeters; this is supposed to fend off the anti-tank missiles which Hizbullah has recently made very successful use of. Israeli soldiers in their bunkers can see and fire through the netting. \"But you wouldn't necessarily see any advance preparations [for a pull-out],\" said Major Herv\u00e9 Collet of France. \"They could be out within three days if they leave their equipment behind.\" But what Israel does about its SLA allies is a far trickier question: that does require advance planning. Like Mr Barak, the SLA commanders cling to the hope that it will be a withdrawal by agreement. \"They tell us that there is nothing to worry about,\" said an SLA spokesman, Raymond Abu Mrad. \"But without an agreement it will be very bad for us, Lebanon, and the region.\" For Israel to withdraw unilaterally would seem to make nonsense of the whole rationale which the security zone has embodied - to keep hostile forces away from the international border. But the conditions on which it hopes to extricate itself from the so-called Lebanese mud have eroded drastically over the years. A UN peacekeeping officer said: \"I believe Barak would be content with just a piece of paper from the Lebanese government guaranteeing the security of the frontier; then, with any violation of it, he would feel free to flatten Lebanon.\" But, in the absence of wider agreement, Mr Barak is most unlikely to get this. There is no assurance that Lebanon would even send its army up to the frontier. It has not deployed in the Jezzin salient, from which the SLA withdrew last summer. And a Damascus newspaper, Tishreen, warned yesterday that the withdrawal decision \"contains the seeds of war in the entire region\". It is Hizbullah's stated policy not to compete with the state in any evacuated areas. But state or no state, there would seem to be nothing to stop it from blending into the local population wherever it pleases - such as in the Shi'ite villages of Kfar Kela, almost within shouting distance of the Israeli settlement of Metullah. Whatever the strategic risk Israel would be running, its soldiers would be getting out of their Lebanese hell-hole. But the SLA members have nowhere to go, except for their senior commanders, security men and prison administrators of ill repute. It is assumed that Israel would arrange a haven for those, perhaps 150 in all, who would face severe reprisals if they stayed behind. The SLA's commander, General Antoine Lahd, sentenced to death by Beirut, now spends as much time in France as in command of his troops. \"He's made his pile from all the taxes and duties he levies and can't wait to enjoy it,\" said a local businessman. \"God knows what will happen to us,\" said an official at the Kfar Tibnit crossing-point between the Israeli-occupied zone and sovereign Lebanon. He reflected the fears of all the rank and file, now plagued by demoralising, sometimes very improbable, rumours. The latest of them, from an Israel newspaper, is that they and their families will be shipped en masse to Turkish Cyprus. The fate of the SLA, and its reaction, is what raises the greatest fears among the local population. \"We shall never let Hizbullah come here,\" said Mr Abu Mrad. \"And have we been fighting and dying for 25 years, just to be packed off to exile? If the Israelis leave just like that, Gen Lahd couldn't ensure that his men obey him.\" That was a broad hint at the dangerous state of mind which most people here agree would take possession of the SLA if it felt itself abandoned. Resentment would run deep, not only against Syria and Hizbullah, but even more against Israel. Much of the SLA's rank and file, mainly Shi'ites, would probably offer themselves to Hizbullah, if they have not already secretly done so. Others, especially Christians, might refuse to disband. \"My fear is that the SLA will disintegrate, but not completely,\" said a leading resident of Merjayoun. It would, he said, be like the start of the Lebanese civil war all over again, with warlords staking out fiefdoms close to Israel's frontier. And they could be a very wild card indeed. It is a very high-stake diplomatic poker game that Syria and Israel are now playing out over south Lebanon. Of the local players, the SLA has less independence of Israel than Hizbullah does of Syria and Iran. But if ever the puppets had a chance to dictate to the puppet-masters, in the interests of each other, it is now, as the game moves towards its climax. Hizbullah - and in the absence of an agreement, Syria - would like nothing more than for the SLA to force Israel to retain a presence, however limited, in Lebanon. \"We doubt very much that Israel will withdraw completely,\" said the Hizbullah's second-in-command, Sheikh Naim Kassem last week. \"And so Hizbullah will fight on.\"",

He wrote: \"I discover that she has stooped to new depths, alleging I coerced her to serially murder by use of drugs, rape, blackmail, physical violence and practically every crime in the book.\" </p> <p>The letter, written from Ashworth secure hospital on Merseyside, where Brady has been a patient since 1985, was prompted by a Modern Times documentary on BBC2 last week, and based around 150 letters sent by Hindley to a TV producer. </p> <p>She claimed to have helped Brady out of love and fear of what he would do to her and her family. He had raped, beaten and drugged her during their relationship, she said, but she had continued to love him because she was emotionally immature and overwhelmed by his \"powerful personality\". </p> <p>She is mounting a case in the Lords aimed at challenging the home secretary's right to decide she should never be freed. </p> <p>In his letter, Brady, who is appealing to the high court in Liverpool for the right to starve himself to death, complained of Hindley's \"fragmented personality\". He said: \"desperation to extricate herself from the past had finally driven her over the top, into a Victorian melodrama of hyperbolic fiction, in which all concrete evidence against her has been jettisoned in favour of transparent mendacity and evidential amnesia.\" </p> <p>Mr Justice Maurice Kay is expected to rule on Thursday whether Ashworth should continue force-feeding Brady. <br> [John-Dominic Clare]</p> <p> <b>Drugs killed aristocrat in Burma</b><br> A British aristocrat has died of a suspected heroin overdose in a Rangoon hotel room less than a month after his father died. </p> <p>The body of Hugh Fitzroy Newdegate, younger son of the late Viscount Daventry, was found by staff at the five-star Traders hotel on Friday after he failed to answer an overseas phone call. </p> <p>Mr Newdegate, 38, had not been seen since noon the previous day. A packet containing 0.02 grams of heroin was found in the bedside drawer. </p> <p>Mr Newdegate's brother James, 39, the 4th Viscount Daventry, declined to speak from Arbury Hall in Warwickshire, but in a statement the family said: \"We are utterly devastated at reports of his accidental death in Rangoon.\" </p> <p>Their father, 78, died in February after a long illness. </p> <p>Mr Newdegate had been an aviation insurance broker with the London-based Aon Group Ltd, on whose behalf he was in Rangoon. Peter Tritton, an executive director, said: \"We have been advised of nothing to suggest that this is anything other than a tragic accident.\" </p> <p>Last night the foreign office said Burmese police were investigating the death. The results of an autopsy would not be known for at least two days. At Rangoon general hospital a drug overdose was found to be the cause of death, according to Kyemon Daily, the official newspaper. <br> [Sarah Hall]</p> <p><b>Guardian website wins award</b><br>Guardian Unlimited, the Guardian's website, has won a prestigious award for best use of new media by a media owner in the Revolution Awards. The judges said: \"The great advantage of the Guardian's strategy, with its Unlimited network of sites, is that it takes all the strengths of the Guardian and the Observer newspapers and creates something new. </p> <p>\"Guardian Unlimited's sites are united by an overarching brand identity. They have the newspapers' tone, but are arranged in a way that takes advantage of the interactive medium.\" </p> <p>They added: \"The company uses the web to give a greater depth of information than it can in print, but it also uses the immediacy of the medium to provide more up-to-the-minute news.\" </p> <p>The awards are sponsored by the new media business and marketing magazine Revolution. </p> <p> <b>Supporter of Shayler questioned</b><br> A London student was being questioned last night after being arrested under the official secrets act in connection with the former MI5 officer, David Shayler. </p> <p>Julie Ann Davies, 36, was arrested at Kingston university, Surrey, by special branch officers with a warrant requiring the college to provide access to her computer. </p> <p>She is understood to have been active in the campaign to get charges dropped against Mr Shayler. She was arrested under section 5 of the act covering the receipt and disclosure of official information without authority. </p> <p>Peter Scott, vice chancellor of the university, said: \"The university would be concerned if a discredited piece of legislation was being used to suppress legitimate investigation.\" <br> [Richard Norton-Taylor]</p>",

[Michael White] Brady: I did not coerce Hindley Moors murderer Ian Brady has said that his former lover Myra Hindley was lying in saying he forced her to take part in their killings. In a letter to journalists, Brady, 62, also described her as an attention-seeker and a chameleon who would say whatever she thought would please. He wrote: \"I discover that she has stooped to new depths, alleging I coerced her to serially murder by use of drugs, rape, blackmail, physical violence and practically every crime in the book.\" The letter, written from Ashworth secure hospital on Merseyside, where Brady has been a patient since 1985, was prompted by a Modern Times documentary on BBC2 last week, and based around 150 letters sent by Hindley to a TV producer. She claimed to have helped Brady out of love and fear of what he would do to her and her family. He had raped, beaten and drugged her during their relationship, she said, but she had continued to love him because she was emotionally immature and overwhelmed by his \"powerful personality\". She is mounting a case in the Lords aimed at challenging the home secretary's right to decide she should never be freed. In his letter, Brady, who is appealing to the high court in Liverpool for the right to starve himself to death, complained of Hindley's \"fragmented personality\". He said: \"desperation to extricate herself from the past had finally driven her over the top, into a Victorian melodrama of hyperbolic fiction, in which all concrete evidence against her has been jettisoned in favour of transparent mendacity and evidential amnesia.\" Mr Justice Maurice Kay is expected to rule on Thursday whether Ashworth should continue force-feeding Brady. [John-Dominic Clare] Drugs killed aristocrat in Burma A British aristocrat has died of a suspected heroin overdose in a Rangoon hotel room less than a month after his father died. The body of Hugh Fitzroy Newdegate, younger son of the late Viscount Daventry, was found by staff at the five-star Traders hotel on Friday after he failed to answer an overseas phone call. Mr Newdegate, 38, had not been seen since noon the previous day. A packet containing 0.02 grams of heroin was found in the bedside drawer. Mr Newdegate's brother James, 39, the 4th Viscount Daventry, declined to speak from Arbury Hall in Warwickshire, but in a statement the family said: \"We are utterly devastated at reports of his accidental death in Rangoon.\" Their father, 78, died in February after a long illness. Mr Newdegate had been an aviation insurance broker with the London-based Aon Group Ltd, on whose behalf he was in Rangoon. Peter Tritton, an executive director, said: \"We have been advised of nothing to suggest that this is anything other than a tragic accident.\" Last night the foreign office said Burmese police were investigating the death. The results of an autopsy would not be known for at least two days. At Rangoon general hospital a drug overdose was found to be the cause of death, according to Kyemon Daily, the official newspaper. [Sarah Hall] Guardian website wins award Guardian Unlimited, the Guardian's website, has won a prestigious award for best use of new media by a media owner in the Revolution Awards. The judges said: \"The great advantage of the Guardian's strategy, with its Unlimited network of sites, is that it takes all the strengths of the Guardian and the Observer newspapers and creates something new. \"Guardian Unlimited's sites are united by an overarching brand identity. They have the newspapers' tone, but are arranged in a way that takes advantage of the interactive medium.\" They added: \"The company uses the web to give a greater depth of information than it can in print, but it also uses the immediacy of the medium to provide more up-to-the-minute news.\" The awards are sponsored by the new media business and marketing magazine Revolution. Supporter of Shayler questioned A London student was being questioned last night after being arrested under the official secrets act in connection with the former MI5 officer, David Shayler. Julie Ann Davies, 36, was arrested at Kingston university, Surrey, by special branch officers with a warrant requiring the college to provide access to her computer. She is understood to have been active in the campaign to get charges dropped against Mr Shayler. She was arrested under section 5 of the act covering the receipt and disclosure of official information without authority. Peter Scott, vice chancellor of the university, said: \"The university would be concerned if a discredited piece of legislation was being used to suppress legitimate investigation.\" [Richard Norton-Taylor]",

The UK trails most of Europe in death rates with about 110,000 dying every year. About 300,000 a year have a heart attack and over 1.4m suffer from angina. Mr Milburn called the launch of the national service framework the start of a crusade which he has marked out as a personal priority. \"Coronary heart disease hits the poorest hardest.

The national service framework for coronary heart disease which has taken top clinicians two years to put together is a blueprint for best practice, laying down guidelines for the next 10 years. It aims to ensure that everyone receives equal and high quality treatment. The man charged with implementing the reforms is Roger Boyle, consultant cardiologist at York district hospital and a member of the 40-strong team of clinicians and NHS executives who put the document together under the chairmanship of Sir George Alberti, president of the Royal College of Physicians. Dr Boyle, whose official title is national heart director but who has already been dubbed heart tsar because of the similarity of his job to that of cancer tsar Mike Richards, acknowledged yesterday that shrinking the inequality gap would be \"a formidable challenge\". Death rates under the age of 65 from coronary heart disease are nearly three times higher in Manchester than in Kingston and Richmond, Surrey. \"My job is to make this paper a living document,\" he said. \"We need more doctors, more surgeons, more nurses, more operations and shorter waits.\" The document presents an ambitious agenda , from setting up fast-track pain clinics in hospitals to see patients with suspected angina within two weeks of referral from a GP to speeding up ambulance response times so that heart attack victims get the urgent treatment that can save lives. There will be 700 defibrillators in public places to help anybody who has a heart attack; clot-busting drugs will be made available within an hour of anyone calling for help; GPs must set up registers of patients at risk and ensure they are prescribed aspirins, beta blockers or cholesterol-lowering drugs to stave off further trouble. An extra 30 training places for consultant heart surgeons, in addition to the 80 announced last November, will be set up. But the National Heart Forum, while praising the document as much needed , was critical of the focus on treatment when most heart disease was preventable. The document proposes more clinics to help people give up smoking and calls for health authorities and others to tackle obesity, exercise, smoking and diet.

      "bodyText": "A jury heard yesterday how a key ring dropped near a semi- naked body in a copse led police to the home of the alleged murderer. Bristol crown court was told that Jenny King, 22, failed to return to her Bristol home after going out on Friday night, October 30 1998. She was reported missing the next day, and her body was found by police three days later, beaten and strangled and with muddy footprints on her abdomen. Roderick Denyer QC, prosecuting, told the court that the police had made a \"painstaking\" search of the dense copse of ivy and brambles, known as the Den, where the body was found, and after two days had discovered two keys on a ring. The keys were later found to fit the front and back doors of the house in Bristol where Paul Hunt, 22, a factory worker, lived with his mother, the court heard. He denies a charge of murder. Mr Denyer told the court that on the night in question, after going into Bristol city centre with a friend Miss King made her way to Chasers nightclub in Kingswood by 1am. Her brother Andrew, who was in Chasers that night, gave her a fiver to take a taxi home. Unfortunately, said Mr Denyer, she had not taken one. \"She never got home and her brother reported her missing later that Saturday afternoon. Her body was discovered on the following Tuesday.\" Ray and Margaret King sobbed in court as the prosecutor showed the jury of eight men and four women photographs of the murder scene and their daughter's body. Mr Denyer said that she was found naked from the waist down. She had been severely beaten round the face. \"She died because she was strangled, but she was beaten before she died,\" he told the jury. Hunt was arrested on November 11, the court heard. Fibres from a green Ralph Lauren shirt seized at his house after the arrest were an exact match with fibres found on clothes Miss King had been wearing on the night she died. A pair of Truka shoes bought for Hunt by his mother were examined, the court heard, and the pattern and wear on the soles corresponded with marks on Miss King's stomach. And soil samples from the shoes bore \"a most striking similarity\" to that of the Den area where the body was recovered. Mr Denyer said that on the night in question Hunt had been out to a Bristol nightclub with a friend but had left alone at about 1.30am, as recorded on video camera. At around 3.30 that morning Hunt's mother was woken by her son banging on the back door of the house they shared. \"He says he has lost his key so she has to let him into the house,\" Mr Denyer told the jury. \"We say that the keys found at the scene close to Jenny's body are the defendant's keys, dropped by him during the course of his assault.\" Mr Denyer told the court there was no evidence of any sexual assault to tie the defendant to the crime, but he argued that the evidence of the keys was overwhelming and the fabric and shoe pattern evidence strong. \"Put these various things together, and you have an overwhelming case that it was this defendant who killed Jenny King, probably around three o'clock in the morning of Saturday October 31 1998.\" The trial continues and is expected to last up to three weeks.",

      "bodyText": "GCHQ, the government's electronic spy centre, is to spend over \u00a3800m on new headquarters, the centre announced yesterday. A bagel-shaped complex, the size of Wembley stadium, will be built in the next four years at an existing GCHQ site in Cheltenham. It would ensure the centre's \"readiness for the hi-tech national security and intelligence-gathering challenges of the 21st century\", it said. About \u00a3400m will be raised on the bond market by Integrated Accommodation Services, a consortium of Carillion (formerly Tarmac), Group 4 and British Telecom, which has been awarded the contract under the government's private finance initiative. This sum will include the capital cost of the building, estimated at \u00a3330m, and interest on the loan. Total capital and running costs are estimated at \u00a3800m at today's prices over the next 30 years, during which the consortium will manage the project. GCHQ said ministers took the decision after a rigorous review of the costs and how best to keep the centre operational. It had \"one of the largest and most sophisticated computer systems in the world, supporting the vital contribution GCHQ makes to national asecurity,\" it said. Francis Richards, the centre's director, described the deal as excellent, combining \"maximum efficiency, better working conditions for our staff and excellent value for money\". Critics of the private finance initiative, however, argue that it would be cheaper for the government itself to raise money on the bond market, and that by leasing the building for 30 years from the private consortium it will be paying more than if it had simply been given the money by the treasury. Parliament's intelligence and security committee said last year that GCHQ had already increased its original estimate, and expressed concern about the risks of further increases. GCHQ described itself yesterday as Britain's signals intelligence agency, providing \"vital services to government departments and military commands in support of the government's security, defence, foreign and economic policies\". What it did not say is that it works closely with the US national security agency eavesdropping on commercial as well as diplomatic and military communications through a worldwide network of satellites and ground stations. The NSA runs Menwith Hill, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, one of America's largest eavesdropping centres, officially described as an RAF station. GCHQ, officially responsible to the foreign office, employs about 4,500 civilians and 2,000 military personnel. Its annual budget is estimated at \u00a3500m.

Vanity Fair, the American magazine which takes celebrity culture seriously, has anointed nine young actors as its stars of tomorrow. Having spotted the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Cate Blanchett early in their careers - and given a leg-up to a struggling, little-known Australian called Nicole Kidman a few years back - the Vanity Fair stamp of approval is said to be worth $1m on a star's fee. The glossy, which combines copious amounts of \"eye candy\" starlet photospreads with wodges of intellectual roughage, so prides itself on its talent-spotting abilities that it devotes an issue every year to its young Hollywood pretenders. The Class of 2000 includes two stars from the Oscar favourite American Beauty - Mena Suvari, who played the high school temptress, and Wes Bentley, the freakish teenage drug dealer - alongside the obscure Marley Shelton and Jordana Brewster. The only halfway established name is Penelope Cruz, the Spanish model turned actress who played a nun who dies of Aids after having sex with a transsexual prostitute in Pedro Almodovar's All About My Mother. All adorn the cover in a group shot by the celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, Hollywood's answer to Van Dyck, and an artist who could make Wilfred Bramble look handsome. However, the Vanity Fair list is not infallible. British actresses Thandie Newton and Anna Friel made it into the frame last year, and although both have had good years on stage and screen, neither has quite broken through. Nor are their contemporaries - the likes of Omar Epps, Barry Pepper and Vinessa Shaw - quite household names either.",

Fantastic ! Anyway, having regaled the press with countless hilarious anecdotes from the set (etc), he heads back to the States later tonight. Unfortunately, even in the age of pet passports, the likelihood of his more talented co-star, Mac the German Shepherd, arriving to carouse with the nation's journalists remains open to question. Croon feeding... But let's not be guilty of neglecting another pair of giants among men currently en route to the UK. So yes, if you would ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Englebert Humperdinck and Harry Connick Jr, independently dropping into London very soon indeed for respective performances at the Palladium (on Thursday) and the Albert Hall (next Monday). Sorry to be a party pooper again, but neither party will be sticking around long, although - just in case you were getting too downcast - Englebert will return in April for a full national tour. Sing Hallelujah!",

You know it's none of your business. If you come across the bank account of your employer and you suddenly notice that they haven't got any money, and you're worried about what that means for you, you can't get involved.

      "body": "<p>In a Baghdad cancer hospital, 200 patients share one bottle of aspirin. Morphine isn't available to alleviate the patients' pain, you understand, because of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. In place since 1990 and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the sanctions mean that morphine, along with other medicines, clean water, fresh foods, electricity and soap have been out of the reach of ordinary Iraqi citizens. Pain is about all they have left. That, and a dignity which they displayed in abundance throughout John Pilger's heart-breaking film, <strong> Paying The Price: Killing The Children Of Iraq</strong> (ITV). </p> <p>And if that weren't enough, they also have the hollow words of Tony Blair, Robin Cook and George Bush, who assured them - or rather, us - that the Iraqi people are not our enemy. Sanctions are designed, you understand, to bring down Saddam and not to bring misery to those already suffering under the despot. </p> <p>While children die of diphtheria, women suffer terminal breast cancer and families auction their belongings to buy food, Pilger interviewed representatives of the West sitting in their plush offices, coiffed and well-groomed. They took issue with World Health Organisation figures which estimate 500,000 children have died in Iraq because of the embargo. They talked of the undesirable effects of sanctions, the tough choices that have to be made, the difficult position in which they find themselves. Yet in their offices with cheap-looking expensive artwork, it was hard to imagine them in a position quite as difficult as suffering the agonising pain of cancer with the only relief taking the shape of half an aspirin. </p> <p>But hey, at least all this suffering means that Saddam can't get his hands on weapons of mass destruction. With vaccines for yellow fever banned, medical equipment unavailable and even toilet soap regarded as contraband, there was no chance of him developing chemical weapons, beating the world to death with an IV drip or, um, cleaning us to death. A hellish farce, to be sure. </p> <p>Typically, Pilger's passion burned fiercely at the heart of this film alongside that of Dennis Halliday, a UN official who was so sickened by the sanctions, he resigned, though not before breaking the blockade himself to get vital drugs to an Iraqi girl suffering from leukemia. Through their words, and the pictures of children malnourished and bug-eyed with disease, children being punished for crimes perpetrated before they were even born, Paying The Price was a stark portrait of what our political masters think is a fair price worth paying for keeping the world safe for us. </p> <p>If you didn't know better, you would think that the UN - benevolent, just, concerned - were deliberately trying to kill off Iraq and its culture, starting with its children. Halliday and Pilger do know better and that's what they think. It was hard not to agree with them. Paying The Price was the kind of film that should have us searching our souls but will probably have us flicking over. </p> <p>It would have had us flicking over to <strong> Cry Wolf</strong> (BBC1). </p> <p>From the cheeky oboe of the theme tune and the flimsy jokes and characterisation - which made the MDF set look like the Pyramids at Giza - watching this was like the 90s never happened: the spirit of Duty Free alive and well. </p> <p>Dr Wolf - actually played by Dr Bramwell from ITV - had a fling with her boss-to-be and four months later, started work at his surgery. With the obligatory unsympathetic receptionist (see also My Hero and a couple of series of Casualty) and a dippy health visitor, the surgery was in Elephant and Castle, which required the schemey hypochondriac expectant single mum, Cherry, to say things like \"Mel Gibson - gorgeous ain't he!\" Poverty, worra larf. </p> <p>Anyway, Dr Wolf was pregnant too and lo, the father was her boss, who, incidentally, lives on a houseboat. In the weeks to come, we will presumably be treated to clashes between Dr Wolf, all-glacial Penelope Keith, and her boss, the slightly giddy, older-man-becoming-a-father, Dr Hook. She says she doesn't love him now, but you can bet over the series, the will-they, won't-they thing will be milked silly. </p> <p>Missy, the corn snake, had eggs stuck in her bits in <strong> Flying Vets</strong> (Channel 5) so Mark, the expert in lower vertebrates like fish and lizards, set about her with a scalpel. Then, he may well have been heading off the United Nations.</p>",

While children die of diphtheria, women suffer terminal breast cancer and families auction their belongings to buy food, Pilger interviewed representatives of the West sitting in their plush offices, coiffed and well-groomed. They took issue with World Health Organisation figures which estimate 500,000 children have died in Iraq because of the embargo. They talked of the undesirable effects of sanctions, the tough choices that have to be made, the difficult position in which they find themselves. Yet in their offices with cheap-looking expensive artwork, it was hard to imagine them in a position quite as difficult as suffering the agonising pain of cancer with the only relief taking the shape of half an aspirin. But hey, at least all this suffering means that Saddam can't get his hands on weapons of mass destruction. With vaccines for yellow fever banned, medical equipment unavailable and even toilet soap regarded as contraband, there was no chance of him developing chemical weapons, beating the world to death with an IV drip or, um, cleaning us to death. A hellish farce, to be sure. Typically, Pilger's passion burned fiercely at the heart of this film alongside that of Dennis Halliday, a UN official who was so sickened by the sanctions, he resigned, though not before breaking the blockade himself to get vital drugs to an Iraqi girl suffering from leukemia. Through their words, and the pictures of children malnourished and bug-eyed with disease, children being punished for crimes perpetrated before they were even born, Paying The Price was a stark portrait of what our political masters think is a fair price worth paying for keeping the world safe for us. If you didn't know better, you would think that the UN - benevolent, just, concerned - were deliberately trying to kill off Iraq and its culture, starting with its children. Halliday and Pilger do know better and that's what they think. It was hard not to agree with them. Paying The Price was the kind of film that should have us searching our souls but will probably have us flicking over. It would have had us flicking over to Cry Wolf (BBC1). From the cheeky oboe of the theme tune and the flimsy jokes and characterisation - which made the MDF set look like the Pyramids at Giza - watching this was like the 90s never happened: the spirit of Duty Free alive and well. Dr Wolf - actually played by Dr Bramwell from ITV - had a fling with her boss-to-be and four months later, started work at his surgery. With the obligatory unsympathetic receptionist (see also My Hero and a couple of series of Casualty) and a dippy health visitor, the surgery was in Elephant and Castle, which required the schemey hypochondriac expectant single mum, Cherry, to say things like \"Mel Gibson - gorgeous ain't he!\" Poverty, worra larf. Anyway, Dr Wolf was pregnant too and lo, the father was her boss, who, incidentally, lives on a houseboat. In the weeks to come, we will presumably be treated to clashes between Dr Wolf, all-glacial Penelope Keith, and her boss, the slightly giddy, older-man-becoming-a-father, Dr Hook. She says she doesn't love him now, but you can bet over the series, the will-they, won't-they thing will be milked silly. Missy, the corn snake, had eggs stuck in her bits in Flying Vets (Channel 5) so Mark, the expert in lower vertebrates like fish and lizards, set about her with a scalpel. Then, he may well have been heading off the United Nations.",

Mr Norris, who has 11% support overall, secures only 40% of the Tory vote, compared with 48% for Mr Livingstone. The poll indicates that the Tory voters will be engaging in tactical voting on a scale unseen for more than 20 years.</p> <p>The detail of the poll spells only despair for Frank Dobson. He might have hoped that those who were supporting Mr Livingstone - particularly Labour voters - were doing it only as a mid-term whinge at the performance of the Labour government.</p> <p>But when those who said they intended to vote Ken were asked about their motives it was the personality factor that proved the strongest of all.</p> <p>Nearly all Livingstone voters think he has been treated unfairly by Labour. Two thirds think that Frank Dobson is a weak candidate and want to give Tony Blair a kick by voting for Ken, but when they were asked to specify the principal reason for voting for him 72% said they believed he was the best candidate for mayor.</p> <p>Even among that select group of Conservatives for Livingstone, 68% said they would back him because he was the best candidate, and only 13% said they were backing him mainly because they wanted to give Tony Blair a kick.</p> <p>The only possible saving grace for Mr Dobson lies in the 18% who say they have not made up their mind. But even if the official Labour candidate were to sweep the board among these \"don't knows\", it seems inconceivable that he will be able to demolish Mr Livingstone's overwhelming lead in the next two months, given that he starts his campaign at such a low level of support - 13%.</p> <p>But there must be disappointment for those who had hoped that a Livingstone bid for mayor would boost the turnout. Those who say they are certain to vote account for only 41% - about the same level as a similar ICM poll a fortnight ago.</p> <p>As to the immediate future, the poll brings more bad news for Labour. The next few days will be dominated by the process of expelling Mr Livingstone from the party for standing against an official candidate.</p> <p>The poll shows that this may bring even more unpopularity for the party. Some 59% believe that expelling him would be unfair, as against 27% who do not. Among Labour voters those who believe it would be unfair reaches 68%.</p> <p>However much the question of expulsion might be understood and accepted by party activists, the poll shows that the reasons are not understood by London voters. They are even more hostile to the idea of other Labour members being expelled for openly supporting Livingstone. Only 12% of London voters believe this would be fair, and even 72% of those who say will vote for Frank Dobson think it would be unfair.</p> <p>ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,003 adults aged over 18 by telephone on March 6. Interviews were conducted across London, and the data has been weighted to the profile of all London adults.</p> <p>Ken Livingstone's biographer, John Carvel, will be live online on the Guardian network at 2pm today to answer your questions about Livingstone's mayoral bid.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The breathtaking 55% poll lead that Ken Livingstone has built up in the battle to be the first elected mayor of London is reinforced by nearly every detail of the findings of the Guardian/ICM opinion poll. Mr Livingstone's cross-party popularity in London has become so great more than 70% of Labour and Liberal Democrat voters in the capital say they will support him against their party candidates - and an extraordinary 48% of Conservative voters say they will back him. The poll shows that Livingstone's support is solid at over 60% among both men and women, across all social classes and all age groups. Steven Norris, the Tory candidate, is humiliatingly eclipsed by Mr Livingstone among Conservative voters. Mr Norris, who has 11% support overall, secures only 40% of the Tory vote, compared with 48% for Mr Livingstone. The poll indicates that the Tory voters will be engaging in tactical voting on a scale unseen for more than 20 years. The detail of the poll spells only despair for Frank Dobson. He might have hoped that those who were supporting Mr Livingstone - particularly Labour voters - were doing it only as a mid-term whinge at the performance of the Labour government. But when those who said they intended to vote Ken were asked about their motives it was the personality factor that proved the strongest of all. Nearly all Livingstone voters think he has been treated unfairly by Labour. Two thirds think that Frank Dobson is a weak candidate and want to give Tony Blair a kick by voting for Ken, but when they were asked to specify the principal reason for voting for him 72% said they believed he was the best candidate for mayor. Even among that select group of Conservatives for Livingstone, 68% said they would back him because he was the best candidate, and only 13% said they were backing him mainly because they wanted to give Tony Blair a kick. The only possible saving grace for Mr Dobson lies in the 18% who say they have not made up their mind. But even if the official Labour candidate were to sweep the board among these \"don't knows\", it seems inconceivable that he will be able to demolish Mr Livingstone's overwhelming lead in the next two months, given that he starts his campaign at such a low level of support - 13%. But there must be disappointment for those who had hoped that a Livingstone bid for mayor would boost the turnout. Those who say they are certain to vote account for only 41% - about the same level as a similar ICM poll a fortnight ago. As to the immediate future, the poll brings more bad news for Labour. The next few days will be dominated by the process of expelling Mr Livingstone from the party for standing against an official candidate. The poll shows that this may bring even more unpopularity for the party. Some 59% believe that expelling him would be unfair, as against 27% who do not. Among Labour voters those who believe it would be unfair reaches 68%. However much the question of expulsion might be understood and accepted by party activists, the poll shows that the reasons are not understood by London voters. They are even more hostile to the idea of other Labour members being expelled for openly supporting Livingstone. Only 12% of London voters believe this would be fair, and even 72% of those who say will vote for Frank Dobson think it would be unfair. ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,003 adults aged over 18 by telephone on March 6. Interviews were conducted across London, and the data has been weighted to the profile of all London adults. Ken Livingstone's biographer, John Carvel, will be live online on the Guardian network at 2pm today to answer your questions about Livingstone's mayoral bid.",

In the end, he will always do what is in the interests of Ken.\"</p> <p>Leftwing Labour backbencher David Winnick said: \"This is outright treachery. I don't believe for a moment that he ever had any intention of keeping his promise not to stand as an independent. This is a man who's never had the slightest loyalty to anyone but himself. He's already being called 'Ramsay Livingstone' in the tearoom.\"</p> <p>Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing North, added: \"He has no idea of teamwork and would pick a fight with himself if there was no one around.

The responsibility lies 100% with Millbank and No 10. I feel this is a really sad day and this whole business will do terrible damage to the Labour party. Ken is the overwhelming choice of members of the Labour party in London and he is the best qualified candidate.\"</p> <p>Martin Bell, the Independent MP for Tatton, said: \"Ken is entitled to stand as a flat-earther if he wants. This is a democracy. If the voters believe he's disqualified himself by breaking a promise, that's up to them but he has name recognition and ample free media coverage so I think the prospects are quite good for him.\"</p> <p>The disgraced former Tory mayoral candidate Lord Archer predicted a win for Mr Livingstone, adding: \"There's a myth about him at the moment, which of course will burst after he's been there for a certain period of time, because he is human like anyone else.\"</p>",

As Tories and Liberal Democrats at Westminster rubbed their hands with glee at the prospect of what one MP called \"a Labour bloodbath\", many on the Labour benches were angry at Mr Livingstone's \"treachery\" to the party. Tony Banks, the former sports minister and West Ham MP, described the decision as \"deeply sad\" and \"an enormous act of disloyalty\". He said: \"Ken's taking a big gamble and he's about to walk into oblivion. It's not about giving Londoners what they want, it's about giving Ken what he wants. In the end, he will always do what is in the interests of Ken.\" Leftwing Labour backbencher David Winnick said: \"This is outright treachery. I don't believe for a moment that he ever had any intention of keeping his promise not to stand as an independent. This is a man who's never had the slightest loyalty to anyone but himself. He's already being called 'Ramsay Livingstone' in the tearoom.\" Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing North, added: \"He has no idea of teamwork and would pick a fight with himself if there was no one around. Labour MPs are really angry about this.\" Michael Foot, Labour's former leader, said: \"I am very sad to hear the announcement ... especially in the light of the clear assurance he had made that he would not take such action against the Labour party.\" But while many on the left blamed Mr Livingstone for the debacle, veteran leftwinger Tony Benn said: \"This began with the sacking of Dobson, the fixing of the electoral system and the demonising of Ken. The responsibility lies 100% with Millbank and No 10. I feel this is a really sad day and this whole business will do terrible damage to the Labour party. Ken is the overwhelming choice of members of the Labour party in London and he is the best qualified candidate.\" Martin Bell, the Independent MP for Tatton, said: \"Ken is entitled to stand as a flat-earther if he wants. This is a democracy. If the voters believe he's disqualified himself by breaking a promise, that's up to them but he has name recognition and ample free media coverage so I think the prospects are quite good for him.\" The disgraced former Tory mayoral candidate Lord Archer predicted a win for Mr Livingstone, adding: \"There's a myth about him at the moment, which of course will burst after he's been there for a certain period of time, because he is human like anyone else.\"",

In 1976, he did the hat-trick against Sussex at Eastbourne; five years later, against Essex at Grace Road, Leicestershire's home ground, he shared an unbroken county record second wicket stand of 289 with David Gower. </p> <p>He continued to play for Leicestershire until retirement after the 1986 season, by which time he was 45 years old, with more than 19,000 first-class runs and 300 wickets to his name. Thereafter, he augmented the county coaching staff, as well as joining the umpires' list in 1988, a profession he was still enjoying last summer. </p> <p>Balderstone's football career began at Huddersfield and, after Carlisle, took in Doncaster Rovers and Queen of the South. </p> <p>During the last 30 years, there have been a number of cricketers who have tried making a career out of cricket and football; direct contemporaries of Balderstone, at his best, were the likes of Jim Cumbes, who played cricket for Lancashire, Surrey and Worcestershire and football for Aston Villa (among other clubs), and Ted Hemsley, also of Worcestershire and Sheffield United. Later, Arnie Sidebottom, of Yorkshire, played one Test for England and, briefly, for Manchester United. </p> <p>Alan Ramage also bowled aggressively for Yorkshire, while playing 100 equally fierce first-team games for Middlesborough and Derby; Ian Botham fleetingly played centre-forward for Scunthorpe, and, more recently, the Glamorgan and Sussex batsman Anthony Cottey played at Swansea, while still in his formative cricket years. </p> <p>But for all-round sporting excellence, no one before or since - not CB Fry or Wilson of the Wizard - can have matched Balderstone's performance on September 15 and 16 1975. Playing for Leicestershire against Derbyshire, at Queen's Park, Chesterfield, he spent the early part of the second day in the field as his county secured the bowling points they needed to clinch the county championship to go with the Benson and Hedges Cup won earlier in the season. By close of play, with Leicestershire now batting, Balderstone was 51 not out. </p> <p>He then hurried from the ground, made his way to Doncaster in time for a 7.30 kick off, and proceeded to score a goal against Brentford, before returning to his Chesterfield hotel. Next day, he completed his century before he was run out. </p> <p>If Balderstone's football was what pundits would term \"cultured\", then so was his batting. He was never flamboyant, rarely ruffled, elegant, and, being tall, reliant on the front foot rather than back. He bowled left-arm spin at a pace so deceptively slow that it is surprising there was energy left on the ball ever to dislodge a bail. Against other international sides he might have played more Tests, for he was chosen on the strength of consistent quality performances for Leicestershire. It was his misfortune, however, to come up against the West Indies just as they were reaching that level of intimidation they were to maintain for the next two decades. </p> <p>His first match, at Headingley, brought a ponderous 35 in the first innings followed by 4 in the second; the next, at a parched Oval, merely disaster, for he encountered Michael Holding and one of the finest fast-bowling performances in history. Twice his stumps erupted from the ground before he had got off the mark. He was never considered again. </p> <p>He did manage a wicket in that game, however, during his only international bowl, when the middle-order batsman Collis King sent a delivery so high and far that on any other ground it would have been six. The whole area of the Oval was in use, however, and the fielder at long-on, myself, was able to take a shoulder-high catch. The delighted bowler ran to the fielder, and clapped him warmly on the back. \"That,\" he said, \"has put them in the shit.\" The scoreboard read 647 for seven. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Newspaper leader-writers have never had academia's comfortable pauses for reflection, but need something of the scholar's instincts and equipment if their judgments against the clock are to have weight and effect.</p> <p>Frank Edmead, who has died aged 80, exemplified these special gifts: a good linguist, an omnivorous reader, a careful student and meticulous analyst of affairs, with a particular passion for Chinese history and culture. One of the most perceptive and well-informed Guardian leader-writers throughout a difficult post-war decade, and largely responsible for steering the paper's policy through the minefields of the Middle East and south-east Asia, his resignation as a matter of principle in 1967 was felt by many colleagues to be a tragedy for the paper, and perhaps for its editor, as well as for Frank.</p> <p>How it came about is set out in Changing Faces, Geoffrey Taylor's history of the Guardian from 1956-88: \"Before the start of the six-day war in June 1967 Frank Edmead had established an editorial line on Palestine against which all future comment would have to be measured. Most people on the paper would say he had done the same for Vietnam. The editor altered course on both subjects\" - and within a space of less than three weeks.</p> <p>On Vietnam, Edmead had argued a line of careful but consistent criticism of the American engagement, less emotional than, but consonant with, most reporting by the paper's staff and special correspondents, among them Clare Hollingworth and Martha Gellhorn. The editor, Alastair Hetherington, after a visit to Vietnam - during which he had been given free and welcoming access to the American generals - wrote endorsing the American presence as the force most likely to produce peace.</p> <p>In the case of Palestine, Edmead, in a signed column on May 29, had produced what Taylor called \"the dialectical half-nelson from which no subsequent Guardian leader-writer was able to escape\". Why, if the Jews claimed the right to return after 2,000 years, had the Palestinian refugees no such right after only 20 years? Given that Muslims had not generally persecuted Christians, why should the Palestinians suffer for the wickedness of European Christians? \"At the receiving end, Zionism looked like yet another European colonial movement; settlers flowed in, to acquire much of the land and all of the political power.\"</p> <p>But again, in a long leader on June 12, Hetherington wrote that it would be \"neither surprising nor wholly wrong\" if Israeli policy were to include the keeping of the Old City of Jerusalem and most of the west bank.</p> <p>When Edmead left shortly afterwards, the feeling of many colleagues was expressed in a letter that the then features editor, Christopher Driver, wrote to Hetherington. \"We are shaking off irreplaceable individualists at an alarming rate and the latest and most lamentable departure looks to the rest of us directly attributable to the fact that generals and politicians have your ear more than historians or students of Asian behaviour. I doubt whether your arguments on Vietnam will outlast a year, let alone a decade.\"</p> <p>Edmead and Hetherington had both joined the Manchester Guardian in 1950. Hetherington, who served through the war as an officer in the Royal Armoured Corps, made his name as defence correspondent, and defence remained an abiding interest.

      "bodyText": "Newspaper leader-writers have never had academia's comfortable pauses for reflection, but need something of the scholar's instincts and equipment if their judgments against the clock are to have weight and effect. Frank Edmead, who has died aged 80, exemplified these special gifts: a good linguist, an omnivorous reader, a careful student and meticulous analyst of affairs, with a particular passion for Chinese history and culture. One of the most perceptive and well-informed Guardian leader-writers throughout a difficult post-war decade, and largely responsible for steering the paper's policy through the minefields of the Middle East and south-east Asia, his resignation as a matter of principle in 1967 was felt by many colleagues to be a tragedy for the paper, and perhaps for its editor, as well as for Frank. How it came about is set out in Changing Faces, Geoffrey Taylor's history of the Guardian from 1956-88: \"Before the start of the six-day war in June 1967 Frank Edmead had established an editorial line on Palestine against which all future comment would have to be measured. Most people on the paper would say he had done the same for Vietnam. The editor altered course on both subjects\" - and within a space of less than three weeks. On Vietnam, Edmead had argued a line of careful but consistent criticism of the American engagement, less emotional than, but consonant with, most reporting by the paper's staff and special correspondents, among them Clare Hollingworth and Martha Gellhorn. The editor, Alastair Hetherington, after a visit to Vietnam - during which he had been given free and welcoming access to the American generals - wrote endorsing the American presence as the force most likely to produce peace. In the case of Palestine, Edmead, in a signed column on May 29, had produced what Taylor called \"the dialectical half-nelson from which no subsequent Guardian leader-writer was able to escape\". Why, if the Jews claimed the right to return after 2,000 years, had the Palestinian refugees no such right after only 20 years? Given that Muslims had not generally persecuted Christians, why should the Palestinians suffer for the wickedness of European Christians? \"At the receiving end, Zionism looked like yet another European colonial movement; settlers flowed in, to acquire much of the land and all of the political power.\" But again, in a long leader on June 12, Hetherington wrote that it would be \"neither surprising nor wholly wrong\" if Israeli policy were to include the keeping of the Old City of Jerusalem and most of the west bank. When Edmead left shortly afterwards, the feeling of many colleagues was expressed in a letter that the then features editor, Christopher Driver, wrote to Hetherington. \"We are shaking off irreplaceable individualists at an alarming rate and the latest and most lamentable departure looks to the rest of us directly attributable to the fact that generals and politicians have your ear more than historians or students of Asian behaviour. I doubt whether your arguments on Vietnam will outlast a year, let alone a decade.\" Edmead and Hetherington had both joined the Manchester Guardian in 1950. Hetherington, who served through the war as an officer in the Royal Armoured Corps, made his name as defence correspondent, and defence remained an abiding interest. Edmead, a Quaker, had driven an ambulance across Europe following the Normandy landing (once crossing a minefield to rescue a wounded German soldier), and had been promoted from a talented reporters' room when Hetherington became editor in 1956. Very different in many ways, each was a believing Christian, and each respected the other. Indeed, Edmead said later that he thought Hetherington, in his memoirs, had treated their differences with admirable fairness. History gives Edmead the better of the argument, but probably both of them could really be seen as victims of the cold war. Frank was a Kentish man, educated at Borden school, Sittingbourne, and University College, London, where he read English. After his war service, he worked with German children evacuated to Austria (some of them from the Adolf Hitler school for the children of Nazi elite), shepherding hundreds back to ruined Germany in journeys that required resourcefulness and ingenuity. After his break with the Guardian he returned to University College to do post-graduate work in conflict studies, eventually teaching systems science at the City University, where, unsurprisingly, he developed a special interest in catastrophe theory. In retirement, this principled but gentle and sweet- natured man returned to his old love, China, spending every other year teaching at the universities of Shanghai and Xi-an and travelling widely in remote territories, intriguing people with his Shanghai accent. No use asking him what he was going to write. Nothing, he said; he had undertaken not to. Anyway, he'd written enough, and there was so much to see and do. On a final trip to Yunan in 1996, he caught pneumonia, and several times nearly died following complications on his return. At the end, he seemed to be not much more than spirit. But frail as he was, he usually got to meetings at the old Friends' house in Hemel Hempstead; and was not to be discouraged from turning out on a cold day in January to attend Alastair Hetherington's memorial service. His wife, Joan, died in 1974. He is survived by his daughters, Mary and Madeleine.",

      "bodyText": "Belgium has incurred Iranian fury after the launch of a criminal investigation into Iran's ex-president Hashemi Rafsanjani. The move has powerful echoes of the Pinochet saga. Officials in Brussels confirmed last night that the same judge who sought to have the former Chilean dictator tried was investigating charges that Mr Rafsanjani was party to illegal imprisonment and torture. With Belgium squirming as fellow European Union members beat a path to Tehran's door, the Islamic republic reacted furiously yesterday, hinting at the sort of consequences threatened in the Salman Rushdie affair. Ayatollah Hassan Saneii, head of the semi-official Khordad Foundation - still offering a $2.8m (\u00a31.7m) reward for the killing of the British author - warned Belgium to apologise immediately. \"Our reactions will not only be verbal,\" the Jomhuri Islami newspaper quoted him as saying. \"If the Belgian government does not make up for this impudence of the Belgian court, it must await active measures from the Iranian nation, and especially the Khordad Foundation.\" Iran's official news agency described the investigation as \"insolent, vindictive and insulting\" and said it was \"in step with the evil aims of Israel and America\". The row threatens to cast a shadow over EU attempts to build a new relationship with Iran after the stunning performance of reformist candidates in last month's legislative elections. Italy's foreign minister, Lamberto Dini, was ending his three-day visit to Iran yesterday, just as his German counterpart, Joschka Fischer, was due to arrive for a two-day stay. Britain's foreign secre tary, Robin Cook, is also due in Tehran to set the seal on a fresh relationship after the Iranian government formally dissociated itself from the threats to the Satanic Verses author in 1998. Eyebrows were raised when Belgium - not previously known for its ethical foreign policies - seized the high moral ground in the Pinochet affair and demanded to see evidence of the medical tests that eventually allowed the general to go home. It has also played a militant role in EU measures against the inclusion of J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party in the Austrian government. The examining magistrate Damien Vandermeersch launched the human rights investigation at the instigation of an unnamed Iranian living in Belgium, but embarrassed officials insisted last night that it had nothing to do with the government. The Belgian foreign ministry said in a statement that the government had no power to intervene, but wished to maintain good relations with Iran. More broadly, the case illustrates the change that the Pinochet affair has created by ending the sense that a former head of state enjoys automatic immunity for acts committed while in office. On Sunday Mohammad Khatami, the reformer who succeeded Mr Rafsanjani in 1997, said the investigation against his predecessor was the work of \"enemies of the Iranian nation\" and warned that Iran would \"spare no effort to defend its credibility, strength and dignity\". Mr Rafsanjani was seen as a moderate when he became president in 1989 and set about reconstruction after his country's brutal 1980-88 war with Iraq, but he was discredited by economic failures and increasingly associated with hardliners.",

A thundering editorial in the Liberation Army Daily said that \"millions of troops stand in combat readiness and are on high alert\". \"We will adopt all measures to firmly crush any attempts to divide China and will realise the complete reunification of the motherland,\" it continued. Significantly, the army paper repeated a warning delivered by Beijing two weeks ago that an \"indefinite refusal\" by Taiwan \"to solve the reunification issue peacefully through negotiations\" would constitute grounds for war. Mr Zhu, in his report to the national people's congress, had merely stated that China would \"not sit idly by\" if Taiwan took serious separatist action. The tougher stance was taken at the weekend in speeches by the president, Jiang Zemin, and the most senior Communist party general, Zhang Wannian. The newspaper also clearly denounced the opposition leader Chen Shui-bian, one of the three main candidates in Taiwan's presidential election on March 18, despite Mr Chen softening his line on negotiations with Beijing last month.

      "trailText": "Lord Aldington is not alone in losing out on his \u00a31.5m libel award.  Clare Dyer  says the law can make it hard to claim the cash.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Eight years ago Lord Aldington complained that Count Nikolai Tolstoy, who hadn't paid a penny of the \u00a31.5m libel damages he had been awarded three years before, was living the same lifestyle he had enjoyed before the action. A Volvo estate car was parked in the drive of Tolstoy's \u00a3300,000 Jacobean farmhouse, while Aldington had exchanged his \"company Bentley for a two-year-old Ford Escort\".</p> <p>Now Tolstoy's Oxfordshire home must be worth nearer \u00a31m. He still lives there and Aldington has still not received a penny of the damages, and only a tiny fraction of the \u00a3350,000 costs. But Tolstoy's lifestyle is about to get a significant boost: he has inherited half the \u00a33m estate left by his stepfather, the writer Patrick O'Brian.</p> <p>Tantalisingly, the inheritance - though it may be dented by tax - is near enough the sum Aldington still reckons he is owed after successfully suing Tolstoy over a pamphlet accusing him, then Brigadier Toby Low, of sending 70,000 Cossacks and Yugoslavs to their deaths in 1945. But Aldington cannot touch the windfall. Tolstoy, a historian and distant relative of the author of War and Peace, filed for bankruptcy in 1990 after losing the libel action. He has now emerged a discharged bankrupt, closing the books on earlier debts.</p> <p>\"In a sense the winner had lost and the loser remained unbowed,\" notes David Hooper in his forthcoming book Reputations under Fire: Winners and Losers in the Libel Business. \"The case is likely to be remembered for the disproportionately large award of damages and the legal manoeuvring which deprived Lord Aldington of the fruits of his victory in court.\"</p> <p>Both parties were backed by others: Aldington by Sun Alliance, the company of which he was then chairman, and Tolstoy by the Earl of Portsmouth, later to be Neil Hamilton's backer in his fight against Mohamed al Fayed, and the Forced Repatriations Defence Fund, set up to solicit money to fight the claim.</p> <p>Tolstoy's house, owned jointly with his wife, was subject to a bank charge for an outstanding loan. Well-wishers set up a trust fund in his wife's name to pay the family's living expenses. The four children completed their educations at private schools, including Eton, and went on to university.</p> <p>Aldington thinks he may be able to stake a claim to some of the legacy to recoup costs awarded against Tolstoy in later proceedings, but the sums will be comparatively small beer.</p> <p>\"Here we are nearly 10 years after he went bankrupt and the clock began ticking,\" said the 85-year-old peer yesterday. \"I have not had a penny but I haven't given up and the lawyers are seeing what can be done. The law is meant to benefit the debtor rather than the creditor.\"</p> <p>The libel claimant who loses ignominiously and faces debts of millions in damages and costs but still remains ensconced in an enviable piece of real estate is almost a clich\u00e9. Jonathan Aitken may have lost his furniture but he still holds court in the \u00a31.8m house in Lord North Street, allegedly his wife's. Neil Hamilton last week won a stay on the enforcement of a \u00a3500,000 costs order by Fayed, and has so far not had to sell his old rectory - which his own solicitors wisely took a charge for their costs - or his pied \u00e0 terre in central London.</p> <p>Aldington is not the first winner in a defamation case to come off worse than the loser. Dr Malcolm Smith won a record \u00a3150,000 slander victory, plus costs, in 1991 against Dr Alanah Houston, his partner in a medical practice, who accused him in front of a few patients of sexually harassing her and their staff. Nine years later both doctors' lives have been devastated by the aftershocks of those few words, but Smith is the bigger loser.</p> <p>He lost his home and surgery and is still embroiled in expensive legal proceedings. In 1998, when he successfully applied to the High Court to have Houston jailed for contempt of court, he was unemployed, living with his father and still caught up in spin-offs from the original case. His solicitor had sued him for fees and he had countersued, alleging the lawyer was negligent in not warning him how expensive the case could be. He lost and was ordered to pay the fees but the solicitor, Thomas Watts, said yesterday that he was still owed \u00a3200,000.</p> <p>Houston declared herself bankrupt but was jailed for three months for disobeying court orders not to redistribute her assets, including a flat in Malta.

      "bodyText": "Eight years ago Lord Aldington complained that Count Nikolai Tolstoy, who hadn't paid a penny of the \u00a31.5m libel damages he had been awarded three years before, was living the same lifestyle he had enjoyed before the action. A Volvo estate car was parked in the drive of Tolstoy's \u00a3300,000 Jacobean farmhouse, while Aldington had exchanged his \"company Bentley for a two-year-old Ford Escort\". Now Tolstoy's Oxfordshire home must be worth nearer \u00a31m. He still lives there and Aldington has still not received a penny of the damages, and only a tiny fraction of the \u00a3350,000 costs. But Tolstoy's lifestyle is about to get a significant boost: he has inherited half the \u00a33m estate left by his stepfather, the writer Patrick O'Brian. Tantalisingly, the inheritance - though it may be dented by tax - is near enough the sum Aldington still reckons he is owed after successfully suing Tolstoy over a pamphlet accusing him, then Brigadier Toby Low, of sending 70,000 Cossacks and Yugoslavs to their deaths in 1945. But Aldington cannot touch the windfall. Tolstoy, a historian and distant relative of the author of War and Peace, filed for bankruptcy in 1990 after losing the libel action. He has now emerged a discharged bankrupt, closing the books on earlier debts. \"In a sense the winner had lost and the loser remained unbowed,\" notes David Hooper in his forthcoming book Reputations under Fire: Winners and Losers in the Libel Business. \"The case is likely to be remembered for the disproportionately large award of damages and the legal manoeuvring which deprived Lord Aldington of the fruits of his victory in court.\" Both parties were backed by others: Aldington by Sun Alliance, the company of which he was then chairman, and Tolstoy by the Earl of Portsmouth, later to be Neil Hamilton's backer in his fight against Mohamed al Fayed, and the Forced Repatriations Defence Fund, set up to solicit money to fight the claim. Tolstoy's house, owned jointly with his wife, was subject to a bank charge for an outstanding loan. Well-wishers set up a trust fund in his wife's name to pay the family's living expenses. The four children completed their educations at private schools, including Eton, and went on to university. Aldington thinks he may be able to stake a claim to some of the legacy to recoup costs awarded against Tolstoy in later proceedings, but the sums will be comparatively small beer. \"Here we are nearly 10 years after he went bankrupt and the clock began ticking,\" said the 85-year-old peer yesterday. \"I have not had a penny but I haven't given up and the lawyers are seeing what can be done. The law is meant to benefit the debtor rather than the creditor.\" The libel claimant who loses ignominiously and faces debts of millions in damages and costs but still remains ensconced in an enviable piece of real estate is almost a clich\u00e9. Jonathan Aitken may have lost his furniture but he still holds court in the \u00a31.8m house in Lord North Street, allegedly his wife's. Neil Hamilton last week won a stay on the enforcement of a \u00a3500,000 costs order by Fayed, and has so far not had to sell his old rectory - which his own solicitors wisely took a charge for their costs - or his pied \u00e0 terre in central London. Aldington is not the first winner in a defamation case to come off worse than the loser. Dr Malcolm Smith won a record \u00a3150,000 slander victory, plus costs, in 1991 against Dr Alanah Houston, his partner in a medical practice, who accused him in front of a few patients of sexually harassing her and their staff. Nine years later both doctors' lives have been devastated by the aftershocks of those few words, but Smith is the bigger loser. He lost his home and surgery and is still embroiled in expensive legal proceedings. In 1998, when he successfully applied to the High Court to have Houston jailed for contempt of court, he was unemployed, living with his father and still caught up in spin-offs from the original case. His solicitor had sued him for fees and he had countersued, alleging the lawyer was negligent in not warning him how expensive the case could be. He lost and was ordered to pay the fees but the solicitor, Thomas Watts, said yesterday that he was still owed \u00a3200,000. Houston declared herself bankrupt but was jailed for three months for disobeying court orders not to redistribute her assets, including a flat in Malta. Mr Justice Tucker said she was \"exceedingly devious\" after ruling that she had deliberately avoided paying the damages, reduced to \u00a350,000 on appeal. The judge said he was satisfied that Houston was determined that her former partner, whom she had called \"a little toad,\" would get as little as possible of her money. He said Smith had become \"completely obsessed\" by the case and allowed it to take over his life. \"Having won a decision in his favour and an award of damages to compensate him, he has been frustrated in his attempts to recover his damages or his costs and left with a very large bill for his legal fees.\" But the judge said he could not simply order Houston to pay because she had been discharged from bankruptcy, which meant damages and costs could no longer be enforced. Houston at least managed to salvage something of her career, finding work as a family planning doctor and a police surgeon. Anyone contemplating suing must factor in the likelihood that if he loses he will declare himself bankrupt, landing the winner with the bills. Supporters with open chequebooks like the Earl of Portsmouth are not easy to come by, and groups of small backers will have second thoughts after the judge's ruling in the Hamilton case that his supporters may have to stump up for Fayed's costs. As even Jeffrey Archer belatedly discovered, in most libel cases there is no winner. Everyone's a loser bar the lawyers.",

      "bodyText": "The rip-off Britain campaign was blamed partly for driving down profits by 20% at Inchcape, the former conglomerate which jettisoned its shipping and bottling businesses to focus on car distribution. A slump in British car sales as consumers wait for an expected drop in prices built on other difficulties for Inchcape, including a particular downturn in sales of Toyota and Mazda models in Britain. Inchcape's annual headline pre-tax profits fell to \u00a385.3m from \u00a3106.1m as turnover plunged to \u00a34.45bn from \u00a35.51bn. The profit figure was before exceptional gains of \u00a3214m for the sale of various businesses, while a dividend of 21p was paid for the 12 month period, compared with 67.2p last time. But the company's battered share price took a turn for the better, rising 12p to 252p last night as the City welcomed management optimism about future trading opportunities outside Britain. There are also hopes that ownership of internet car sales provider Autobytel UK will provide good results in future - although converting site \"hits\" to firm sales in the early months seems to have been sluggish. Inchcape finance director Alan Ferguson said it cannot be sure whether the British importation and distribution business will bounce back given the uncertainty ahead of next month's Competition Commission report into the new car market. But Inchcape believes that Toyota and Mazda sales in Britain should recover after a restructuring which affected last year's sales. There are high hopes that a 45% sales increase in Greece last year plus 30% growth in Singapore will continue, however. The important Hong Kong market, in which Inchcape controls 42% of sales and where margins are high at up to 7%, should also be stronger after a falling 20% in the first half of 1999 but growing 4.5% in the second half. \u0095New car registrations in Britain fell to 73,737 in February, down 12.3% from the same month last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has reported. The SMMT had forecast 70,000 registrations for February and said the actual result was still encouraging, given expectations for a strong performance in March for the new W licence-plate car. \"This...gives us confidence to underline our 2.2m forecast for the year,\" the SMMT said. Registrations had been expected to suffer some fall in February as a result of the move to the twice-yearly licence-plate prefix letter change system.",

      "body": "<p>It needed somebody with both clout and a clean record to say it: directives on the granting of company share options are so out-dated and parochial they risk damaging the standing of UK plc in the new-fangled global economy. So says Reuters, one of our few truly \"international\" companies which now seems ready to take on the institutional status quo to get things changed. </p> <p>The British approach to the subject could not be more British. Working on behalf of the major institutional investors, the Association of British Insurers, having taken soundings and lunch and noted the number of \"fat-cat\" stories in the press, from time to time publishes updates on its \"Guidelines, guidance notes and other relevant material\" covering everything from executive pay to voting at annual meetings. These do not amount to \"rules\" in the hard and fast sense, but woe betide any substantial British corporate which ignores them. </p> <p>Yet according to page 24 of its freshly printed 1999 annual report, Reuters is now ready to do precisely this. \"The competition for talent in the new economy is fierce and the pool limited ... ,\" begins a mince-free declaration of the company's remuneration objectives. It goes on to point out that pay at Reuters has to measure up to policy and practice in the US, the undisputed leader in all matters internet: \"Both large and start-up companies in the US offer stock options which pay out on the basis of a company's stock price, with no other performance links. Reuters believes that, to compete, it must do the same.\" </p> <p>What is more, companies outside the US are now adopting the American model and, in short, \"the remuneration environment has become global, as is the challenge and the opportunity\". </p> <p>The ABI's guidelines on stock options state, categorically, that awards should in all cases be linked directly to clear performance targets (such as a rise in earnings per share over a specified period). But Reuters wants to adopt the US model, where, effectively, equity is handed out as another form of salary. There's no messing about - if the share price goes up, so does the manager's or engineer's take-home pay. </p> <p>To back up its argument, Reuters points to Tibco, the specialist networking business, a third of which it floated on Nasdaq last year. It bought the whole thing for $125m (\u00a378m) six years ago; today, its market value stands at $22bn. </p> <p>\"Reuters does not believe this would have been possible without the issue of options to those individuals responsible for creating this value,\" the company declares. Reuters' remaining stake in Tibco (even taking into account options waiting to be exercised) accounts for about a third of its \u00a323bn group capitalisation.The ABI should sit up and take notice. </p> <p><strong> Net education </strong><br> </p> <p> Having spent three years throwing out businesses, Pearson's Marjorie Scardino has suddenly got the company focused on four divisions, each with strong underlying growth and online potential. </p> <p>There's the Financial Times - undergoing expansion geographically such as through the launch of FT Deutschland, while at the same time going through the painful rebirth of FT.com. Then there's the Penguin book publishing division, which has been aggressively building its stable (and doubled its presence in the Guardian Top 100 bestsellers list last year). Online communities are being built around sub-sectors such as Penguin classics and the Rough Guide travel series, while 5% of sales in the US are through online retailers. </p> <p>Meanwhile, television production, can only go one way with the proliferation of channels, while the potential is there for interactive services which again generate e-commerce. After the acquisition of Simon &amp; Schuster two years ago however, the main focus of interest yesterday was in educational publishing which now accounts for more than half Pearson's operating profits. </p> <p>The internet has the potential to add substantial value to educational publishing. Pearson's Simon &amp; Schuster and Longman brands have established trust and relationships with schools and colleges and the group is now well positioned to shift that relationship on to the web after agreeing a distribution deal with America Online, the world's largest internet service provider. </p> <p>The division also seems to have a quantifiable means of generating revenues - whether it be through selling hard copy books which need to be used in association with the online services or charging access for schools and colleges in much the same way that they would buy-in text books. Outside of the school environment, the sites will carry e-commerce and advertising. </p> <p>Much has been made of FT.com. FTYourMoney.com and MarketWatch, the online financial service for private investors which launches in Britain in June. Rich as the financial market is however, Pearson faces stiff competition while in the educational market it has a virtually clear path.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It needed somebody with both clout and a clean record to say it: directives on the granting of company share options are so out-dated and parochial they risk damaging the standing of UK plc in the new-fangled global economy. So says Reuters, one of our few truly \"international\" companies which now seems ready to take on the institutional status quo to get things changed. The British approach to the subject could not be more British. Working on behalf of the major institutional investors, the Association of British Insurers, having taken soundings and lunch and noted the number of \"fat-cat\" stories in the press, from time to time publishes updates on its \"Guidelines, guidance notes and other relevant material\" covering everything from executive pay to voting at annual meetings. These do not amount to \"rules\" in the hard and fast sense, but woe betide any substantial British corporate which ignores them. Yet according to page 24 of its freshly printed 1999 annual report, Reuters is now ready to do precisely this. \"The competition for talent in the new economy is fierce and the pool limited ... ,\" begins a mince-free declaration of the company's remuneration objectives. It goes on to point out that pay at Reuters has to measure up to policy and practice in the US, the undisputed leader in all matters internet: \"Both large and start-up companies in the US offer stock options which pay out on the basis of a company's stock price, with no other performance links. Reuters believes that, to compete, it must do the same.\" What is more, companies outside the US are now adopting the American model and, in short, \"the remuneration environment has become global, as is the challenge and the opportunity\". The ABI's guidelines on stock options state, categorically, that awards should in all cases be linked directly to clear performance targets (such as a rise in earnings per share over a specified period). But Reuters wants to adopt the US model, where, effectively, equity is handed out as another form of salary. There's no messing about - if the share price goes up, so does the manager's or engineer's take-home pay. To back up its argument, Reuters points to Tibco, the specialist networking business, a third of which it floated on Nasdaq last year. It bought the whole thing for $125m (\u00a378m) six years ago; today, its market value stands at $22bn. \"Reuters does not believe this would have been possible without the issue of options to those individuals responsible for creating this value,\" the company declares. Reuters' remaining stake in Tibco (even taking into account options waiting to be exercised) accounts for about a third of its \u00a323bn group capitalisation.The ABI should sit up and take notice. Net education Having spent three years throwing out businesses, Pearson's Marjorie Scardino has suddenly got the company focused on four divisions, each with strong underlying growth and online potential. There's the Financial Times - undergoing expansion geographically such as through the launch of FT Deutschland, while at the same time going through the painful rebirth of FT.com. Then there's the Penguin book publishing division, which has been aggressively building its stable (and doubled its presence in the Guardian Top 100 bestsellers list last year). Online communities are being built around sub-sectors such as Penguin classics and the Rough Guide travel series, while 5% of sales in the US are through online retailers. Meanwhile, television production, can only go one way with the proliferation of channels, while the potential is there for interactive services which again generate e-commerce. After the acquisition of Simon &amp; Schuster two years ago however, the main focus of interest yesterday was in educational publishing which now accounts for more than half Pearson's operating profits. The internet has the potential to add substantial value to educational publishing. Pearson's Simon &amp; Schuster and Longman brands have established trust and relationships with schools and colleges and the group is now well positioned to shift that relationship on to the web after agreeing a distribution deal with America Online, the world's largest internet service provider. The division also seems to have a quantifiable means of generating revenues - whether it be through selling hard copy books which need to be used in association with the online services or charging access for schools and colleges in much the same way that they would buy-in text books. Outside of the school environment, the sites will carry e-commerce and advertising. Much has been made of FT.com. FTYourMoney.com and MarketWatch, the online financial service for private investors which launches in Britain in June. Rich as the financial market is however, Pearson faces stiff competition while in the educational market it has a virtually clear path.",

Rattle is one of Lindberg's foremost admirers, believing the Finnish composer is likely to become one of the great masters of Europe. </p> <p>Born in 1958, Lindberg made his name in the 80s with a series of wonderfully crafted instrumental works that steadily grew in ambition and mastery. Over the next decade he transferred that vivid musical imagery to the orchestra. He'd studied first in Helsinki (with Rautavaara and Heininen) before doing the rounds of some of the European new-music gurus, working with composers such as Grisey, Donatoni and Ferneyhough. </p> <p>Some of their preoccupations were reflected in his early works, but he soon began to hone a personal style. Now he's very much an independent spirit. He lives with his wife and children in Paris as one of those rare creatures: a composer who earns his living entirely through his music. </p> <p>Lindberg had thought about Gran Duo for almost 10 years, since Rattle asked him to write something for Towards the Millennium. What began as an idea for a piece for almost full orchestra (Lindberg's first model for the scoring was Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms) turned out to be a 20-minute work for woodwind and brass (the partners in the duo of the title), with a scoring that is almost identical to that of another Stravinsky work, the ground-breaking Symphonies of Wind Instruments. </p> <p>So he has ended up with an ensemble that he admits is difficult to write for. \"It's like writing for an organ - when nobody's playing you don't hear anything. Without any percussion there are no resonating instruments. Everything is very clean, all the articulation and the shape of every note is bare and immediate and you can't afford to make any mistakes. </p> <p>\"It's been so much a taboo in recent years to see the sections of the orchestra as different. Composers have been trying to mix things together, so in Gran Duo I liked the idea of just remembering that, after all, woodwind and brass instruments are very different from each other.\" </p> <p>He says it was a good piece to write at this stage in his development. \"Having put out quite a few big orchestral works over the past few years, I like the idea of facing an ensemble that is a sort of hybrid between the orchestra and chamber music. The next thing I intend to write is a string quartet, and this was a nice bridge to that world.\" </p> <p>The way Gran Duo evolved could be seen as a paradigm for the way Lindberg's whole output has shifted over the past decade, refining and thinning down his musical language. The turning point was a majestic orchestral score called Aura, written in 1994. \"Aura was a sort of milestone, a summation of all I had done in the 80s. After that, the idea of working slightly more linearly seemed to be the way forward. </p> <p>\"It's difficult to say how and why pieces turn into what they turn into. In the past I have consciously attempted to change direction, to do something radically different, but I think there is a stream underneath what you are doing, shaping the direction your music is going, and you have to respect that. The delicate balance for a composer is how to live with those two aspects of your work - one is the continuous evolution of your music, which has the danger that you will fall into mannerisms and start repeating yourself, and then there is the more rational approach of saying 'Let's try something completely different'. There are dangers in that too.\" </p> <p>Getting the balance right, he thinks, is a question of total familiarity with the material the composer is working with. \"I collect material over a long period, and then I choose what I need for the syntax of a particular work which may have some dramaturgical idea behind it, or a rhythmic idea or a specific interval flavouring the music. There are two processes: there is one where you just invent material without any pressure of deciding where it is going, and then the more difficult part, when you have to decide what you use for a certain piece.\" </p> <p>Lindberg writes his ideas down on paper first, then analyses them with a computer that contains his earlier musical material. The computer doesn't invent anything, he insists, but it helps him to look at what he has written from different angles. Then he works at a piano. \"I need to have physical contact with the sounds. I couldn't write a piece entirely on a piano, or entirely on paper. </p> <p>\"At my age, I feel I am in the middle of a process. I'm still very interested in music theory and research, and I am trying to arrange my schedule so that I have a couple of months clear each year for research, otherwise there's the real danger of finding yourself working on a production line.\" </p> <p>The research explores the ways in which he can combine what he has already discovered into a single flexible musical language. In earlier phases of his career he has concentrated on different aspects of composition in turn; there are pieces that use what he now calls \"new-music\" gestures, and others based upon rhythmic ideas or particular systems of harmonic organisation. </p> <p>The parameters he's interested in at present are more complicated. \"Many people would still say that the ultimate object for a composer is the melody, but I'm not there yet. The goal would be to find a perfect diagonal between how the vertical and horizontal worlds of music interact; that's the tricky part and I'm into that process now.\"</p>",

Last night we heard God's answer. </p> <p>A plague of locusts rampaging through the Grange Farm kitchen wouldn't have surprised these poor tenant farmers after what's happened to them over the past three or four years of The Archers. Fire has destroyed everything they owned, and pestilence has smitten the herd of prime Jerseys they bought with the insurance money. BVD (bovine virus diarrhoea, if you must know), along with Eddie's tendency to shove unpaid bills into drawers, has now left them bankrupt. </p> <p>So the farm stock went for a second time on Friday, in a dispersal sale. Ah well, we thought, at least they've still got the house. Then came last night's bolt from the blue. The Grundys are being evicted by Borchester Land, run by the dastardly Matt Crawford - the one who makes Brian Aldridge seem like a Guardian reader. So much for Clarrie's prayers. </p> <p>It's almost as though the spirit of Thomas Hardy has seeped into the scriptwriting. Exile from Ambridge looms, and the 21st-century version of the workhouse beckons: a council flat in Borchester or even far-flung Felpersham. \"Certainly, there won't be a cosy little council house around the green for them to drop into,\" says Archers editor Vanessa Whitburn, the one who plays God in the studio. </p> <p>So what has Eddie Grundy done to deserve such retribution? OK, he's been a bit of a lad in his time, with his ferrets and his scams. And he once lifted the lid of the Bull's piano to be sick inside. Still, at least he provided light relief on days when Phil Archer was going on about the fat-stock prices and his nephew, Tony, was whingeing about his organic leeks. Why turn a mischievous character into a tragic figure? </p> <p>Whitburn starts by disputing that Eddie's role has ever been entirely comic. \"His ability to raise a laugh is one of the great things about him, but we've never needed head-on comedy characters. I like to think we can find humour in all of them, depending on the situation they're put in. And some of our most popular storylines, in terms of audience reaction, have come when characters like Eddie and Linda Snell reveal a serious underbelly.\" </p> <p>Then there's Eddie's father, Joe Grundy, whose demeanour has become so serious - morose, even - that it's difficult to recall when we last heard his wheezy chuckle. He's taken to sitting on a cold, hard bench in the graveyard and, more recently, driving aimlessly round and round on a tractor. How long before he's found hanging from a rafter in the turkey shed? Whitburn won't be drawn on that: \"They're all very popular characters and we'll be following the whole family in the future.\" But if the Grundys are so popular, surely she can't allow this persecution to continue. Eddie's going to win the lottery, right? Wrong. \"There'll be no fairy-tale ending,\" she says. \"Things are going to be tough for them over the next year or so.\" </p> <p>In the context of a radio drama that's been running for nearly half a century, \"a year or two\" is but the blink of an eye. Storylines have been outlined as far ahead as January's 50th anniversary and the Grundys' fate was sealed at a script meeting six months ago. Whitburn denies that this everyday story of impoverished countryfolk is a BBC balancing act designed to butter up the farming lobby in the wake of grumbling from Tory backbenchers and the Countryside Alliance over \"New Labour propaganda\" in The Archers. The much-criticised \"topical insert\" about Tony Blair's speech to west country farmers was written long after the storyline about Eddie's downfall, Whitburn says. </p> <p>Wastepaper bins in and around her office in Birmingham's Pebble Mill Studios overflow with mail from one lobby or another. But she is able to put her hand on a document from the National Farmers' Union that claims one in 12 jobs in agriculture was lost in the year to June 1999. \"It's only realistic for a drama set in the countryside to reflect what's going on there properly,\" she says. \"Even six months ago it was obvious that farming was going through its worst crisis since the 30s. And the most vulnerable, apart from hill farmers, are small-scale tenant farmers like the Grundys. This is what can happen to people like them.\" </p> <p>One of the difficulties of dramatising their plight, she accepts, is the avoidance of sentimentality. \"The writing has to become sparer to make the tone of these scenes effective. It's not to do with histrionics and tearful over-reaction to events. If we can avoid stereotypical over-reactions then the audience will feel for the characters. That's where the writers' imagination comes in.\" </p> <p>The writer who delivered last night's coup de grace to the Grundys is Peter Kerry, who lives in Stockport and is also on the team producing scripts for Sooty. \"Just when Eddie, Joe and Clarrie had lost everything, I came along and smote them another blow,\" he admits. \"It's a bit below the belt. We discussed long and hard whether it would make the show too depressing. But because these characters are so strongly played, they can ride it. Mind you, comedy has always been the Grundys' staple diet and we've been under instructions to make sure there's some elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Hence Sid Perks's fevered attempts to keep secret his affair with the statuesque line-dancer Jolene Rogers, she of the dysfunctional shower. \"A fine figure of a woman,\" as Joe Grundy observed in happier times. \"My Eddie had a thing for her once.\" </p> <p>On top of losing his livelihood, his stock and his home, Eddie will one day discover that the land- lord of the pub where he can no longer afford to drink has been doing what he could only dream about. It's too, too cruel. \"A hideous irony, isn't it?\" says Whitburn, with almost sadistic satisfaction.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Chardin exhibition at the Royal Academy should not shock you when you walk in, but it does. You are greeted by more or less brown paintings. Brown paintings gummy with grime and dirt-pocked, and paintings flattened by the unforgiving cold irons of conservators who relined them, ironing out the impasto along with the cracks. Other works have been over-cleaned, the paint looking scrubbed, sour and naked. Lots of little brown jobs, as we used to say in the restoration trade, alleviated by the fuzz of blue-grey rabbit fur, the crimson of flat-fish gut, red meat on a plate. I feel unexpectedly turned off by all the dead - more rabbits, hares, red-legged and grey-legged partridges, mackerel (some of which aren't mackerel at all) and rays - and the odd scavenging cat. </p> <p>Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, however, proves anything but a disappointment. You just have to begin again, slow down, work at it, rediscover what it was that drew you here in the first place. Which is all to the good: Chardin's paintings require a certain accommodation, a suspension of expectations and of prejudice. They need time most of all. </p> <p>This mental space is something the paintings have in them, and something the viewer must find within themselves. I worry that this isn't going to be possible at the RA, which has painted the walls of the Sackler Galleries a funny magnolia tint, to set off the brown, and installed a fancy crash-barrier in front of the paintings, expecting a full-tilt crowd. This exhibition is a stop-off for a touring show that began in Paris, travelled to Dusseldorf, and will go on to the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Chardin's works are dispersed in public and private collections all over the world, and this exhibition is undoubtedly the last opportunity we'll have to examine them en masse for years to come. </p> <p>Chardin remains deeply, furtively, profoundly influential, even though there is much about the content and subject matter of his work that initially throws you. Forget the rows of hung-too-close, carved and decorated frames. Forgive the general brownness and look at the paintings. Even forget Chardin the French Academician fixer, who never forgot an insult and never stirred from Paris, and who painted fewer than 300 works in all his 80 years, a full third of them copies and replicas of themselves. </p> <p>In fact, Chardin's work makes one feel that he rarely left his house. His early attempts at history painting were soon abandoned, and he never painted a landscape. Nor did he draw. There is barely a window, let alone a view, in all his paintings. The world was forever being rearranged on a table or against a wall in the studio. Chardin reminds me of Kafka's famous lines: \"There is no need for you to leave the house. Stay at your table and listen. Don't even listen; just wait. Don't even wait; be completely quiet and alone. The world will offer itself to you to be unmasked; it can't do otherwise. In raptures it will writhe before you.\" </p> <p>Chardin was a painter of closely observed reality, and a painter not so much of people or of things, but of paintings. For a man who focused on enclosed corners of the world - game, fish, fruit and bread for the table, a cellar boy scrubbing out a jug, a scullery maid drudging in a corner - Chardin has travelled a long way. We find him infiltrating the work of Cezanne, and in the Cubist still lifes of Picasso and Braque. Chardin is the hidden master of Morandi's desiccated little table-top world; he's there in Balthus's people, and in Lucian Freud. </p> <p>He also turns up in less expected places. Chardin is as much a sculptor's as a painter's painter. His cut melon makes you think of Miro's bronze moons, just as inevitably as his eggs and garlic bulbs lead back to Velasquez and Spanish still lifes (and forward to a robust dinner). When Chardin painted collections of musical instruments, with their tubes, discs, ovals and slots, or arranged Seville oranges, sticks and slabs of bread resting precariously yet so artfully upon one another, he makes you think of the best of Anthony Caro's sculpture, with its rhyming, rhythmic syntax of interconnected, tilting and twisting steel shapes. </p> <p>As Chardin leads your eye inward and around his paintings, from object to object - all of which, in a work like the grand Duck Hanging by One Leg, Pat\u00e9, Bowl and Jar of Cherries, partially overlap and take you on a journey through the painting - the experience is as much physical and sculptural as it is pictorial. All this, in a work that also makes one think of C\u00e9zanne, of the broken forms in a Cubist painting, resolving themselves as they flatten out to meet the picture plane. What holds both the painting and one's thoughts in place is the orange, a still centre of gravity, the painting's generative core. </p> <p>Chardin's paintings of people also find an echo in some of today's best figurative sculpture. This is as much to do with atmosphere and presence as it is to do with form. Certain of Chardin's people - a boy absorbed in watching a top spinning on his desk, the scullery maid and the cellar boy distracted and staring into space, as they mechanically perform their menial tasks, remind me of that condition of presence, of \"a man in a room, waiting for nothing\", that Juan Munoz speaks of. It is a condition of stillness and silence, which also infiltrates every peach pit, every grape, every olive in its cloudy jar of oil. </p> <p>Chardin observed the minutiae of the everyday world. As much as he celebrated things, their textures and colour and shape, he meditated - just like the figures in his paintings, transfixed by being, rather than doing - on the solidity of things, their muteness, their shadows. Even a lone orange, set slightly apart from a number of other objects, with its stalk and a single leaf attached, has a tremendous presence and form. You can feel its enduring existence. </p> <p>He never lets you forget the paintedness of things, their reduction and amplification by the act of being painted. He makes Morandi, to whom he is often compared, look plodding. There's much more to Chardin than this. The girl with the shuttlecock and racket, whose bodice is an inverted truncated cone, which rhymes with the shape of the shuttlecock itself, as though she is becoming the object in her hand by its very contemplation. Chardin, mysteriously, has painted the thing that fills her consciousness, as much as the girl and the object in itself. </p> <p>I look at the boy who watches the top he has set spinning on his desk with the same mesmerised fixation as his own. I almost hear the top, skittering over the desk towards the lip, and wait for it to fall into the open drawer in the front of the desk. Or to land at my feet, on the floor of the gallery. With a jolt, I'm aware I've been standing in the same spot for 20 minutes. Not so much looking at a painting as being inside it, caught in its arrested moment. Chardin makes it possible for one to think of nothing but light turned cold as it passes through a glass of water and falls on a couple of garlic bulbs, of steam rising from a teacup, of the way light is trapped forever in the fur of the rabbit with the broken neck. Chardin is magnificent. </p> <p>Chardin 1699-1779 is at the Royal Academy, London W1, from Saturday to May 29.

During a visit to the north east, the chancellor underlined his commitment to create the best environment for electronic commerce by pledging \u00a332m to the inland revenue and customs &amp; excise and \u00a320m for the department of trade and industry's new small business service (SBS). The moves were disclosed as Mr Brown continued his pre-budget tour of the country's unemployment blackspots. Visiting Sunderland, he stressed re-establishment of the work ethic in every community and the generation of a dynamic business culture. Accompanied by Lord Trotman, the former chairman and chief executive of Ford, who is reviewing the government's small business measures, and David Irwin, in his first day as head of the SBS, Mr Brown said: \"This government will be on your side if you're starting up, growing, hiring, investing, innovating, exporting or going public.\" The north-east has the country's worst employment record and a low rate of small business start-ups but the chancellor highlighted his message by visiting a thriving internet company, Leighton Internet. Compared to the tens of thousands who used to work in the mines and shipyards, the north-east's internet economy is small, its workforce totalling no more than a few thousand. But it boasts the country's first regional electronic economy programme - a regeneration scheme based on information and communication technology - and some rapidly growing firms. Foremost among them is Leighton, based at the Doxford International Business Park, home of the European headquarters of Nike and several major call centres. Less than two years ago, it employed nine people. Now it has a staff of over 75 young graduates. By the end of this year, it should have grown to more than 200. The firm comprises three net-based businesses - DomainNames.com, which registers domain names for companies and individuals, Property-online.com, the biggest online database of residential property in the country, and Leighton, which designs websites for companies such as Vodafone, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Taylor Woodrow. Most successful is DomainNames.com, due to float in June. Paul Callaghan, managing director of the businesses, is coy about estimating the company's value but points out that DomainNames.com's biggest competitor, the US-based Register.com, went public last Friday and by the time the Nasdaq closed was worth $1.78bn. \"One of the problems that small businesses always have is how to get money without having their eyes taken out.

Yet it's one thing to rescore an old silent film, however radically, and quite another to apply new sound to a film that already has its own score. You're on especially dangerous territory when the film is by Godard, a sound design pioneer in his own right.

He seems to sample and process both, so that the original sound comes to us at one remove, as if picked up by radio from a great spatial and temporal distance. </p> <p>Stretched out along the centre of the huge Imax screen, this Alphaville is hallucinatory rather than coolly lucid, with the dense, spongy sound design emphasising the sense of oppressive space. But it undermines the film's feat of conceptual trompe-l'oeil: Alphaville seems to show us an alien sci-fi world, whereas in fact Godard is simply shooting a future- obsessed 1965 Paris. Emphasising futurism, rather than the sense of present-as-future, Scanner's electronica makes the film seem archaic, another of those fanciful Tomorrow's World projections that date sci-fi so quickly. The seductive soundtrack makes Alphaville yield a spatial environment where Scanner is perfectly at home, but Jean-Luc Godard appears to have left the building. </p>",

Theoretically I am on a year out before university having just failed to achieve my necessary grades. </p> <p>I have two As and a D and have applied for university places for the coming year, and so far have two reasonable unconditional offers but nowhere prestigious. </p> <p> Throughout school and since, I always seem to have been given more opportunities than I deserved. I (honestly) am pretty lazy and suspect I have gained these simply through being articulate. </p> <p> I ran a digital photograph library for a publisher while I finished my A-levels. During a spell of temping I was offered this job. Theoretically I have a staff of three, responsibility for liaison with management and technical people and am responsible for the database of products that support a complex web site. </p> <p>Often the job seems to take over my life, but I am in a position to deal with this for now and enjoy it. This is a job many graduates would kill for; I am about to get share options and a pay rise to \u00a317,000 from my current \u00a314,500. I have only had this job since January. </p> <p> I would not describe myself as particularly driven.

I actually worry that future employers will not believe that I have had this much responsibility. </p> <p> Going to university is beginning to seem like an expensive luxury, in such a fast-moving market I would be back where I started, equal with other graduates after three years away.

I have two As and a D and have applied for university places for the coming year, and so far have two reasonable unconditional offers but nowhere prestigious. Throughout school and since, I always seem to have been given more opportunities than I deserved. I (honestly) am pretty lazy and suspect I have gained these simply through being articulate. I ran a digital photograph library for a publisher while I finished my A-levels. During a spell of temping I was offered this job. Theoretically I have a staff of three, responsibility for liaison with management and technical people and am responsible for the database of products that support a complex web site. Often the job seems to take over my life, but I am in a position to deal with this for now and enjoy it. This is a job many graduates would kill for; I am about to get share options and a pay rise to \u00a317,000 from my current \u00a314,500. I have only had this job since January. I would not describe myself as particularly driven. I am keen to avoid management and want to gain more technical skills so that I come out of this with more than just management skills on my CV. I do not want a pressurised job long-term, yet am finding myself enjoying this one and wanting more responsibility. I actually worry that future employers will not believe that I have had this much responsibility. Going to university is beginning to seem like an expensive luxury, in such a fast-moving market I would be back where I started, equal with other graduates after three years away. I have calculated that going to college would cost me approximately \u00a380,000 in debts and lost earnings. But I cannot shake off this lingering feeling of inferiority. I feel as if I am constantly failing at the job, as if I am not trusted, and as if my word is not taken on issues I know a considerable amount about.

Mid-set Makeba proves she still has bite, performing with cold, clear intensity Hugh Masekela's So Into Blues, a lament about the 1976 Soweto uprising. At moments like these, her deep voice somehow expresses all the struggle, sorrow and resilience of her country. \"They call us the dinosaur,\" she says majestically, \"but at least the dinosaur has history.\" </p> <p> Africa: Roots &amp; Shoots continues until March 15.

      "bodyText": "Moby is something of an oddity, so perhaps it was to be expected that this last gig of his short UK tour would be full of curiosities, touches of musical genius and occasional frustrations too. Not that the performance wasn't great. It was. He was. Moby bounded on stage like Tigger and kept on bouncing, banging his bongos with the vigour of a man being sustained by illegal narcotic substances. Which he most definitely wasn't because Moby is dead against things like drugs, and doesn't much care for alcohol or meat either. In eight years and five albums, he has mixed a bewildering number of genres (house, trance, ambient, hard-rock, goth-metal, soul) and been feted for bringing something fresh to every one. Play, his current CD, is a gem that hasn't been dulled by constant airplay or the fact that it provides the theme tune to Leonardo di Caprio's latest and unloved film,The Beach.
