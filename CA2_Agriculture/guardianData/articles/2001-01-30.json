      "body": "<p><strong> Most overcrowded</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Birmingham</strong> prison, a Victorian monster three miles from the city centre, tops the Prison Reform Trust's roll of dishonour on overcrowding. More than 750 of the 1,083 inmates are crammed two to a one-person cell, in a facility built for 732. In November, the prison's board of visitors observed hundreds of inmates having to eat in cells beside open lavatories. Dishonourable mentions also to <strong> Leeds</strong> (600 doubling up), <strong> Preston</strong> and <strong> Durham</strong> (500 each) and <strong> Liverpool</strong> (400+). </p> <p><strong> Most violent</strong><br> </p> <p>The Prison Reform Trust has calculated the overall risk of being assaulted while in prison at 9.9%. At <strong> Brinsford</strong> young offenders' institute, outside Wolverhampton, this soars to a shocking 67.5%. Youth prisons occupied the worst four positions for prison violence, all with an assault rate of over 45%. In contrast, assault rates in male open prisons average only 2.5%. At least 10 had no recorded assaults last year. </p> <p><strong> Least time locked up</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Latchmere House</strong>, a former borstal, has been a resettlement prison since 1991, and works vigorously to integrate inmates into the local community in preparation for their release. More than 70 do real jobs in the community, and the Prison Reform Trust found that inmates spent an average of 74.1 hours a week in \"purposeful activity\", compared to the national average of 23.3 hours. </p> <p><strong> Most time locked up</strong><br> </p> <p> Bottom was <strong> Brixton</strong>, with only 11.1 hours per week, less than two hours per day, spent doing anything worthwhile. </p> <p><strong> Worst for visiting</strong><br> </p> <p>Despite a strong challenge by <strong> Portland</strong> young offenders' institution, situated on a remote Devon peninsula to which visitors must walk a mile from the nearest bus stop, <strong> Dartmoor </strong> prison just nicks the booby prize for least accessible facility. In 1979, Lord Justice May called it \"simply against nature\" that the prison was still in use. Visitors must get a train to Plymouth, followed by a bus to Yelverton and a six-mile taxi journey. Buses run only every two hours on Sundays. Some 25,000 prisoners, over a third of the total population, are held more than 50 miles from their committal court town. </p> <p><strong> Most drug-ridden</strong><br> </p> <p>Much of the blame for the problems at <strong> Featherstone</strong>, on Wolverhampton's outskirts, has been attributed to its design. The \"hotel principle\" of locating cells along short cul-de-sacs off a central open area created a claustrophobic space, difficult for staff to police. Until recently, gangs carried out muggings along the corridors, though restricting movement has reduced this. None the less, <strong> Featherstone's</strong> drugs problem is the worst in the prison service: 35.8% of inmates had positive results for drugs in random tests. </p> <p><strong> Least drug-ridden</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Albany</strong> prison on the Isle of Wight, 85% of whose inmates are sex offenders, had the best record on drugs last year, no inmate testing positively. The overall rate of drug use last year was 14.4%, a marked reduction on previous years, and lower than the prison service's target of 18.5%. </p> <p><strong> Most escapes</strong><br> </p> <p>The prison service's record on escapes has improved sharply since the early-90s, falling by 89%, despite the prison population increasing by almost a half. There have been no Category A (high-risk) escapes since 1995. During 1999-2000, there were 30 from prisons and eight from prison service escorts. This compares with 202 in 1994-5. The most recent serious breakouts were of nine high-security prisoners from <strong> Whitemoor</strong> and <strong> Parkhurst</strong>, two of the most secure prisons in England and Wales, in 1994 and 1995 respectively. The UK's biggest breakout was from the <strong> Maze</strong> in 1983, when 38 IRA prisoners commandeered a kitchen van. </p> <p><strong> Cleanest</strong><br> </p> <p>The Prisons Handbook described <strong> Lancaster Farms</strong> YOI, on farmland outside the city, as \"a shining example of commitment and care\". The Chief Inspectorate of Prisons report in 1995 praised it as \"very clean, with no sign of any graffiti; cells were the tidiest and cleanest we have seen; evening association was more like a first-class, well-organised boys' club than a remand centre\". </p> <p><strong> Dirtiest</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Birmingham</strong> was one of the very worst, again. Its own most recent CIP report (another, probably even more damning, is imminent) observed: \"One part of the centre [was] the untidiest and dirtiest we have seen anywhere.\" The hospital block was particularly \"appalling\". This was a small improvement on Stephen Tumim's report while chief inspector in the early 90s, which found cockroaches, pigeons and feral cats. </p> <p><strong> Best gardens</strong><br> </p> <p>A hotly contested category, with a number of institutions furiously trimming their box hedges each spring in a bid to land the coveted Windlesham trophy, awarded each year by the Royal Horticultural Society. The rules have recently been changed to prevent victors winning two years in a row, a move designed to curb the runaway success of <strong> Whatton</strong> prison in Notts, which won three years in a row in the mid-1990s and is the current trophy holder. Insiders tip <strong> Kingston</strong> prison in Portsmouth to land the award this year. Its pansies, apparently, are of particular note. </p> <p><strong> Best food</strong><br> </p> <p>Stephen Tumim was particularly taken by the dinner he was served at <strong> North Sea Camp</strong>, a small open prison near Boston.

      "bodyText": "Most overcrowded Birmingham prison, a Victorian monster three miles from the city centre, tops the Prison Reform Trust's roll of dishonour on overcrowding. More than 750 of the 1,083 inmates are crammed two to a one-person cell, in a facility built for 732. In November, the prison's board of visitors observed hundreds of inmates having to eat in cells beside open lavatories. Dishonourable mentions also to Leeds (600 doubling up), Preston and Durham (500 each) and Liverpool (400+). Most violent The Prison Reform Trust has calculated the overall risk of being assaulted while in prison at 9.9%. At Brinsford young offenders' institute, outside Wolverhampton, this soars to a shocking 67.5%. Youth prisons occupied the worst four positions for prison violence, all with an assault rate of over 45%. In contrast, assault rates in male open prisons average only 2.5%. At least 10 had no recorded assaults last year. Least time locked up Latchmere House, a former borstal, has been a resettlement prison since 1991, and works vigorously to integrate inmates into the local community in preparation for their release. More than 70 do real jobs in the community, and the Prison Reform Trust found that inmates spent an average of 74.1 hours a week in \"purposeful activity\", compared to the national average of 23.3 hours. Most time locked up Bottom was Brixton, with only 11.1 hours per week, less than two hours per day, spent doing anything worthwhile. Worst for visiting Despite a strong challenge by Portland young offenders' institution, situated on a remote Devon peninsula to which visitors must walk a mile from the nearest bus stop, Dartmoor prison just nicks the booby prize for least accessible facility. In 1979, Lord Justice May called it \"simply against nature\" that the prison was still in use. Visitors must get a train to Plymouth, followed by a bus to Yelverton and a six-mile taxi journey. Buses run only every two hours on Sundays. Some 25,000 prisoners, over a third of the total population, are held more than 50 miles from their committal court town. Most drug-ridden Much of the blame for the problems at Featherstone, on Wolverhampton's outskirts, has been attributed to its design. The \"hotel principle\" of locating cells along short cul-de-sacs off a central open area created a claustrophobic space, difficult for staff to police. Until recently, gangs carried out muggings along the corridors, though restricting movement has reduced this. None the less, Featherstone's drugs problem is the worst in the prison service: 35.8% of inmates had positive results for drugs in random tests. Least drug-ridden Albany prison on the Isle of Wight, 85% of whose inmates are sex offenders, had the best record on drugs last year, no inmate testing positively. The overall rate of drug use last year was 14.4%, a marked reduction on previous years, and lower than the prison service's target of 18.5%. Most escapes The prison service's record on escapes has improved sharply since the early-90s, falling by 89%, despite the prison population increasing by almost a half. There have been no Category A (high-risk) escapes since 1995. During 1999-2000, there were 30 from prisons and eight from prison service escorts. This compares with 202 in 1994-5. The most recent serious breakouts were of nine high-security prisoners from Whitemoor and Parkhurst, two of the most secure prisons in England and Wales, in 1994 and 1995 respectively. The UK's biggest breakout was from the Maze in 1983, when 38 IRA prisoners commandeered a kitchen van. Cleanest The Prisons Handbook described Lancaster Farms YOI, on farmland outside the city, as \"a shining example of commitment and care\". The Chief Inspectorate of Prisons report in 1995 praised it as \"very clean, with no sign of any graffiti; cells were the tidiest and cleanest we have seen; evening association was more like a first-class, well-organised boys' club than a remand centre\". Dirtiest Birmingham was one of the very worst, again. Its own most recent CIP report (another, probably even more damning, is imminent) observed: \"One part of the centre [was] the untidiest and dirtiest we have seen anywhere.\" The hospital block was particularly \"appalling\". This was a small improvement on Stephen Tumim's report while chief inspector in the early 90s, which found cockroaches, pigeons and feral cats. Best gardens A hotly contested category, with a number of institutions furiously trimming their box hedges each spring in a bid to land the coveted Windlesham trophy, awarded each year by the Royal Horticultural Society. The rules have recently been changed to prevent victors winning two years in a row, a move designed to curb the runaway success of Whatton prison in Notts, which won three years in a row in the mid-1990s and is the current trophy holder. Insiders tip Kingston prison in Portsmouth to land the award this year. Its pansies, apparently, are of particular note. Best food Stephen Tumim was particularly taken by the dinner he was served at North Sea Camp, a small open prison near Boston. His successor, Sir David Ramsbotham, was pleased to discover recently that his recommendation for a wider provision of condiments in the canteen had been acted upon. Attached to the prison is a working farm with 900 bacon pigs, 100 breeding sows and 900 sheep. The bacon is reputed to be very tasty. Best community relations Blantyre House was built in the 1910s as a training facility for deprived boys, but has been a Category C resettlement prison since 1991. Because it is preparing inmates for eventual release, a high proportion of them work in the local community after spending six months inside.

      "body": "<p>No one seems to know the whole of Harry's story, but this is what they do know. He was born in Kilmarnock, worked on the railways, became an alcoholic after his parents died. They know he lived rough and that in 1991 he was sentenced to life for starting a series of fires. He is 71. </p> <p>It was never easy to get through to Harry at the best of times, and a couple of years ago it began to get even harder. Depending on who you ask, he was suffering from either Alzheimer's or a form of alcohol-induced dementia. Everyone agrees that he frequently did not know where he was, that he began falling over regularly and became incontinent. Once he borrowed a lighter to light a cigarette and accidentally set his hair on fire. They put him in a cell with a CCTV camera because they were so worried he would do himself an injury. </p> <p>Recently, when he could no longer walk without help, he was moved to a nearby prison hospital. Doctors there said he should be released, but to where? \"It's difficult to find nursing homes that are prepared to take people like that,\" says Stuart McLean, who retired as governor of Portsmouth's Kingston prison last week. \"The last thing they want is to have someone who may be disruptive.\" </p> <p>Harry's case highlights one of the thorniest questions facing our penal system: when, if ever, is someone too old or infirm to be kept behind bars? It is a delicate balancing act between compassion and risk, and right now the scales are tipped heavily against compassion. \"If someone has a terminal illness I will pull out all the stops to give them the dignity of dying a free man,\" says Mr McLean. \"But apart from that there's not a lot I can do. It's difficult to get people released because everyone wants to make sure there's not going to be some sort of miraculous recovery. That can be terribly embarrassing.\" </p> <p>Mr McLean has more experience of these grim calculations than most. Kingston is the only prison in the country with a wing dedicated to elderly prisoners. The administrative wing of the Victorian jail was converted into accommodation for around 30 older prisoners five years ago in response to the rising number of elderly inmates in the system. The numbers of old prisoners has mirrored the explosion in the prison population of the last 15 years. In 1989 there were just 345 prisoners over the age of 60; by 1999 there were 1,053. There are 250 inmates in their 70s and 21 over 80. Until now, however, the prison service has devoted little or no thought to how to handle older inmates. Individual jails do the best they can, usually housing their older inmates in so-called VP (vulnerable prisoner) wings or prison hospitals. \"[The prison service] has no policy on the elderly at all,\" Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, says in an interview with the Guardian to be published on Friday. \"When I discover an 87-year-old on a Zimmer frame with Alzheimer's in a high-security prison, I'm sorry, but I think that is a nonsense.\" </p> <p>Built in 1877 as Portsmouth's town jail, Kingston prison is a generously proportioned, three-storey stone structure surrounded by 20-foot walls topped with a roll of barbed wire. It is renowned for its gardens - complete with aviaries, manicured hedges, water features and artificial bowling green - and its football team. (The team's position at the top of the local league could have something to do with the fact that all fixtures are played at home and visiting supporters are forbidden, admits Mr McLean.) It is also the only prison in Britain that takes only lifers, meaning that at least three-quarters of its inmates are murderers. </p> <p>The idea behind H wing was to give older lifers some protection from the rest of the population, says Mr McLean. Its inmates can circulate in the prison but other prisoners cannot pass through the two heavy gates that separate it from the rest of the jail. The wing itself has many of the trappings of a care home: stairlifts, specially equipped baths and alarm buttons in each room. Its rooms, each shared by four inmates, are bright and comparatively airy and there are several spartan communal rooms that could easily be mistaken for doctors' waiting rooms. Staff appear to be patient and courteous. \"The biggest problem with them is motivation,\" says Jim Clark, one of the officers on the wing. \"We've tried to get them out to play bowls but they just won't go. About a third of them work and the rest of them don't want to move away from their TVs.\" </p> <p>Sir David Ramsbotham has praised Kingston for its treatment of elderly prisoners, so why, I wonder, has the press been kept out until now? A prison service official offers a surprisingly candid response: \"A lot of people in the service have doubts about whether these people should still be in prison.\" </p> <p>It's easy to see why. In one room I meet Boom Boom, a man who looks to be in his 70s leaning awkwardly on a three-legged walking stick. Like many of the inmates on E wing, he is dressed in tracksuit bottoms, T-shirt and slippers. I ask him how old he is and he holds up one hand to show five fingers, while making a series of incomprehensible sounds. </p> <p>\"You're 60, aren't you, Boom Boom?!\" bellows his room-mate, Frank. Frank explains that Boom Boom suffered a stroke before being admitted to prison: \"He can't do much. When he arrived at the Scrubs all he could say was 'boom boom'. That's how he got his name.\" The large, high-ceilinged room is divided into four by a series of drab partitions. The floor is dirty and the cream walls are bare. A TV is flickering noiselessly in the corner and a few books are scattered on the floor. It looks just like the kind of care home you hope you'll never end up in. </p> <p>Mr McLean is quick to point out that Boom Boom and Frank are among the scruffiest inmates on the wing. \"They were living rough before they came in,\" he says. \"No one else will share with them.\" </p> <p>Upstairs the rooms are tidier and less gloomy. The furniture would not look out of place in a student accommodation block. In one room the walls are decorated with pieces of wrapping paper. In another there is an inmate who spends his time making replica Faberge eggs. </p> <p>A photo of Princess Diana has pride of place by Sam's bed. He is 50, 11 years into a life sentence for murder. He's one of the youngest prisoners on the wing, admitted because he suffered a stroke. He has barely seen the two grandchildren who were born since his conviction but he thinks his age has helped him to get through his sentence: \"If I was 21 or 22 at the time I wouldn't have been able to make it.\" </p> <p>The average age of prisoners on E wing is 65, but most look older than that. \"People age quicker in prison,\" says Gill Ripiner, the senior nurse who runs the prison dispensary. \"A 55-year-old inside would be more like a 65-year-old outside. The stress levels are high, they can't do things to relieve the stress and they can't do as much exercise.\" </p> <p>Although they are more likely to suffer medical problems, specialising in older inmates has its advantages, says Mr McLean: \"The staff-to-prisoner ratio can be quite low because you're unlikely to have a serious problem [with violence]. The sort of problem I'm worried about is not an attack, it's that someone will light a cigarette and discard the match.\" Its not just a figure of speech. A senior officer later tells me that several cigarette burns were found on Harry's torso when he was transferred to hospital. \"He'd obviously just rolled over and lain on them. Fortunately all the mattresses are flame resistant.\" </p> <p>Mr McLean says the prison has encountered two unforeseen problems. One has been the reluctance of many older prisoners to go anywhere near E wing. \"It's perceived as dead men's shoes. People think the only way out is by dying.\" In fact, he says, more prisoners have been released to lower-security establishments than have died. </p> <p>The second problem is that many of the inmates are in a poorer condition than the unit had bargained for. \"Unfortunately, fit elderly people do become progressively more frail and the problem we've got now is that we've got people who really we shouldn't be keeping any longer who need to move from residential care into a nursing home, and we are not a nursing home.\" </p> <p>Albert, a neatly dressed 69-year-old who has served 18 years of a life sentence for murdering his wife, describes the condition of some of the E wing prisoners in more graphic terms. \"Christ, we all get old, but you've got blokes pissing in the plant pots and blokes shitting themselves.\" He says he was grateful for a move back to the main part of the prison after he underwent a hip replacement operation. \"I was in there with a chap who'd done 42 years and one night I wake up and he's pissing up against the wall. It could have been brilliant but you've got the wrong people in there. You have people who should be in a hospice.\" </p> <p>Mr McLean acknowledges that there are at least two prisoners on the wing who have \"lost it\" and \"others who you talk to and you think: 'I'm not really getting through here.' \" But as another senior officer points out, senility or even extreme frailty are no guarantee that someone will not reoffend. </p> <p>Dick's case illustrates the dilemma facing the prison authorities. Dick is 57 and has served 16 years of a life sentence for rape. He is suffering from motor neurone disease and wears calipers. Doctors have called for his release, the senior officer tells me, \"which is all very well, but where are you going to put him? He's got to go to a care home but the fact of the matter is that these places often have a lot of young women working in them. Physically he couldn't rape anybody, but he could ravish someone - and can you risk letting that happen?\" </p> <p>With few signs of a more liberal approach to releasing elderly prisoners any time soon, the prison service is at last acknowleging that it will have to hold and care for older and sicker prisoners. It is spending \u00a33m on creating facilities for elderly inmates at several prisons. \"This is something that has crept up on us quite recently,\" said Martin Nary, director-general of the prison service. Kingston has submitted a proposal to upgrade the facilities and staffing of E wing so that it can offer equivalent care to a nursing home. Already, says, Alisdair Munroe, there's not much difference between E wing and many care homes on the outside \"except that it's all male and we don't let them out\". </p> <p>Frank, however, has little time for those who point out that life for him is not very different from what it would be like if he were in a home. \"They say you must like prison. Nobody likes prison. It's a stupid question, it's daft. The same people asking it don't go to the door and open it.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Names of prisoners have been changed.</p>",

The cutbacks follow its acquisition of Anglia, Meridian TV and the HTV network production businesses in the deal with United News and Media last year. Between 25 and 35 programme-making posts will go in Anglia's Norwich base as the Survival unit is moved to Bristol. More jobs, possibly up to 15, are expected to go in Bristol. The Survival team will be merged with the existing natural history programme-makers who work under Tom Archer, United Productions controller of factual programmes. In addition, 25-30 jobs are to be lost across Anglia Television's Norwich-based planning, scheduling and promotions, and studio resources operations. In Southampton, the Meridian Broadcasting payroll is to be cut by up to 30 staff in administration and technical areas. Granada will seek alternative employment within the group for as many as possible of the staff affected. Earlier this month, the company revealed a further 50-60 jobs were under threat in Norwich as Anglia Multi-Media is moved to Manchester and merged with Granada Learning. Sharon Elliott, supervisory official at union Bectu, condemned the scale of the proposed cuts. \"Our members on all sites will be shocked and hugely disappointed that this is almost the first real taste of being part of Granada Media,\" she said. \"It is unacceptable to us that Granada Media should want to show talented and experienced staff the door at operations that are already run efficiently.\" But Granada Media executives defended the staff cuts. \"Today's announcement means Anglia is now well placed to meet the challenges of a competitive global market for programming, while remaining at the heart of the region,\" said Anglia TV managing director Graham Creelman.

Today's expected announcement that BBC Sport has poached world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis from BSkyB is a massive boost to a department that has lost several major sports contracts in recent years. BBC executives have also held \"exploratory talks\" with featherweight title-holder Naseem Hamed, who has only two fights left before his current BSkyB deal ends. And Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison has already signed a BBC deal covering the first two years of his professional boxing career. \"You could reach a situation by the end of this year where all the major British boxers are on the BBC,\" said one boxing source. The deal with Mr Lewis is believed to cover four fights involving the champion himself and 20 bouts in all. The agreement is also thought to allow for Lion Promotions, which is run by Mr Lewis's business manager Adrian Ogun, to promote the BBC fights. There have also been reports of a BBC approach to Frank Warren, the leading UK boxing promoter, about bringing his Sports Networks stable of fighters to the corporation. A BBC Sport spokesman said there \"hadn't been any talks\" with Mr Warren. Mr Warren also dismissed the speculation, saying all fighters contracted to Sports Network remained with Sky. But boxing insiders have speculated that in the current climate, with the BBC getting serious about the sport again, Mr Warren may be keen to reach an agreement under which the public service broadcaster and BSkyB share rights to live boxing action and highlights.

The 63-year-old Strangford MP, who is also a Stormont assembly member, said he was stepping down because of his demanding workload. Mr Taylor, who has represented the constituency for 18 years, said however that he had no intention of retiring from politics. He was a key player in the Good Friday agreement negotiations and he has expressed his desire to increase his role at Stormont and in Northern Ireland public life. Mr Taylor is also keen to play a prominent role in the new police board. However, his resignation comes at a critical point in efforts to save the deadlocked political process and could put the UUP leader, Mr Trimble, under more pressure from hardliners in his party. A fierce battle for his Westminster seat is now likely to follow between the pro-Good Friday agreement wing of the UUP and the anti-agreement Democratic Unionist candidate, Iris Robinson. Mr Taylor, 63, had already been selected to defend Strangford. He won a comfortable 6,000 majority over the DUP in 1997. But Ian Paisley's party is promoting Mrs Robinson, a Stormont representative and the wife of deputy leader, Peter Robinson, as a strong contender. One of Mr Trimble's closest Commons allies, the Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP, Ken Maginnis, is also leaving Westminster at the election and Ulster Unionists were dealt a blow at the polls last autumn when the DUP's William McCrea defeated their candidate, David Burnside, in the South Antrim byelection. Intense talks to broker a deal between unionists, nationalists and republicans on paramilitary decommissioning are making some progress, although the new Northern Ireland secretary, John Reid, cautioned against over-optimism. Tony Blair will meet the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, in Downing Street on Wednesday and they will have to act fast if there is to be a breakthrough before election fever starts. Ulster Unionist hardliners have warned that the party could be annihilated at the polls if Mr Trimble signed up to anything short of a strong guarantee that there would be substantial IRA disarmament. Mr Taylor said last night: \"I expect the Ulster Unionists to hold the Strangford seat and I want to contribute more to the success of the Stormont assembly.

The commitment followed a weekend of wrangling over whether the executive had really set itself on a collision course with Westminster by pledging to abandon the charges. But yesterday Mr McLeish said he could be no more explicit. \"We are embarking on a process which will have as its destination the implementation of free personal care,\" he said. He later added: \"There will be no backsliding.\" The executive is working towards a programme which aims to ensure that as soon as April 2002 any elderly person living north of the border will be entitled to free personal care, which covers things like washing and cooking. But elsewhere in the UK this benefit will remain means tested and only nursing care will be free. Downing Street yesterday ruled out any policy reversal for England and Wales and denied the move north of the border was an embarrassment. \"The fact different decisions are made is not an accidental consequence of devolution,\" said a spokeswoman. But pressure groups said yesterday's Scottish announcement would be used as ammunition to force amendments to the health and social care bill, currently on its way through Westminster. \"It is patently ridiculous that we are now going to have a situation where an elderly person living a few miles across the border will be up to \u00a3350 a week worse off in terms of paying for their care,\" said a spokeswoman for Age Concern England. The abolition of personal care charges was a key recommendation of a recent royal commission, chaired by Sir Stewart Sutherland. But it was initially rejected by the administrations on both sides of the border as too costly and of disproportionate benefit to better-off pensioners. When he took over from the late Donald Dewar, Mr McLeish made it clear he wanted to implement the Sutherland proposals in full. By the middle of last week Mr McLeish backtracked on the issue and the executive announced it planned only to make the means testing system used to calculate who is exempt from personal care charges more fair. The move was widely interpreted as recognition that there was opposition to implementation of Sutherland not just from Westminster but within Mr McLeish's own cabinet. But after Labour's Liberal Democrat coalition partners threatened to rebel and vote with the Scottish National party on the issue, the executive was forced to make an emergency statement to the Scottish parliament. The wording of that statement was ambiguous, however, and it was not until yesterday that Mr McLeish categorically committed the executive to Sutherland's recommendation, going further than many had predicted. \"We are embracing the principles of Sutherland in full,\" he said. Some analysts have predicted that the abolition of personal care charges in Scotland will lead to an influx of wealthy pensioners, anxious to protect their savings, from south of the border.

      "body": "<p>Late Saturday afternoon at the Serpentine Gallery and the German artist Hans Haacke is still tinkering, skewing the symmetries of his arrangement of more than 200 works borrowed from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Haacke is trying to disturb the obsessive-compulsive manners of modern display, messing with curatorial etiquette, making sure the vitrines don't sit square against the walls. Haacke has wrested a vast clutter of things from the lumbering, baggy, omnivorous, many-pocketed institution that is the V&amp;A: photographs, prints, sculptures, pots, paintings, items of clothing, religious artefacts, toys and trivia. Haacke has rearranged all this, regardless of museological classification. In so doing, he has created his own system, which is at times as as tonishing as it is annoying, as subtle as often as it is blundering. </p> <p>The entire Serpentine display should be read as a single work, called Mixed Messages. It is part of a larger collaboration between the Serpentine and the V&amp;A, where 15 artists have also had works installed. Both parts of the show, called Give &amp; Take, open to the public today, following a deal brokered between Julia Peyton-Jones, director of the Serpentine, and the soon-to-be- departing V&amp;A director Alan Borg. </p> <p>Objects, as often as they elicit curiosity, can also incite anger. Mixed Messages is a mad conversation piece, in which stories about empire, colonialism, race, sex, religion, class and cultural division collide with the things which represent them. Things have a life of their own; they have histories which refuse to submit to the categories which would contain them. They have a present, as well as a past. </p> <p>Haacke has been described as a conceptual artist, and as an artist concerned with the social conditions of art. He describes his role at the Serpentine, lightly, as \"social secretary\", getting all these things into the building and getting them to talk to one another. The party - if it is one - begins in high Victorian drag, with wallpaper, pot plants, a gilded mirror and commemorative Great Exhibition vases. Albert and Victoria look on, but Richard Billingham's tattooed mum couldn't give a toss, and does a jigsaw in the corner. Cindy Sherman, dressed for a date at Tiffany's, is an actress in search of a role. She's in the wrong movie. Lady Wolverton's more like it, dressed-up as Brittania for an 1897 Devonshire house ball, with her shield and trident. </p> <p>You laugh, but things quickly take another turn, as one would expect from Haacke. He's not really a party animal. When I heard he was showing at the Serpentine, I thought he might do something extreme; for his great work in the German Pavilion in Venice in 1993, he tore up the floor with jack-hammers, leaving us to teeter over the rubble, and to think about Germany's history. Museums can have dark histories, too. Can any such institution avoid looking at its holdings in a guilty light? The climate at the V&amp;A might well be controlled, the air purified, the lighting kind, but all this seeks to do is to nullify, to omit and suppress, to prevent larger stories being told. In part, Haacke's show is a rescue attempt, a way of giving voice to multiple meanings, mul tiple readings. </p> <p>Haacke has also gone for the grand effect, the killer conjunction. In the high-ceilinged North Gallery, the V&amp;A's cast of Michaelangelo's Dying Slave towers queerfully between a large, pained 13th century crucifix and a tranquil Burmese carved and lacquered Buddha. Two Islamic prayer carpets hang on one wall, opposite a Jewish Torah mantle. </p> <p>If this room is a kind of summit of world religions, it is also a place of rootless reverences. The Dying Slave returns us to the body, to profanities and earthly desires, from which the rest is an escape. Through an open doorway into the next gallery, Canova's Sleeping Nymph is showing us her marble bum. I turn, suddenly, to a picture of Polish soldiers having a souvenir photo taken against a sylvan painted backdrop erected by their photographer amidst the rubble of Warsaw in 1942. A second photographer, Marco Jindrich, photographed this farcical event. This little image is a lesson in the fact that, while hundreds of things ultimately dull the spirit, one thing alone can hold you, and burn a hole in your brain. </p> <p>The 1851 Great Exhibition was the progenitor of the V&amp;A. A commemorative painting of the royal opening sits behind a sculpture by Viet-Hong Lien featuring a crying child, a horrified parent and a pile of poo. The big day out always ends in tears. </p> <p>Over at the V&amp;A, amongst the tranquil shelves and cabinets of cups and jugs, plates and figurines in the British porcelain collection, the room is loud with clattering crockery, tinkling teaspoons, the hum of conversation. The roar of school dinner hour, the buzzing restaurant, someone stacking the washing-up. The ambient sound-collage is disturbing here, making the serried rows of Lowestoft, Worcester and Burslem chinaware all the more silent and static in their dust-free vitrines. Neil Cummings and Marysia Lewandowska's soundscape ends with an almighty disaster with the crockery, a great splintering crash of broken plates. \"They're gonna love this,\" said a V&amp;A attendant, \"It's not punters you get up here, it's scholars.\" I have a vision of an amplified soprano amongst the glassware, shattering everything with a high note. </p> <p>The work of the 15 artists placed by Serpentine curator Lisa G Corrin amidst the collections of the V&amp;A have a much tougher time than Haacke. They have to compete. Mostly, they fail, or are merely irritating. Belgian artist Wim Delvoye's hand-carved and decorated life-sized cement mixer - lovingly detailed with florrid foliage and lions' heads by Indonesian craftsman - has almost no impact in the little vestibule where it sits. The museum subsumes it. </p> <p>J Morgan Puett and Suzanne Bocanegra's new tartans - whose colourways and warp and weft are based on New York ethnic and income demographies, inserted amongst the V&amp;A's Tartan collection - almost disappear. Their presence is furtive, which maybe is the point, but as a gesture it is as meek as it is convoluted. </p> <p>Ken Aptegar's repainted details from the V&amp;A's paintings, placed under glass etched with bits of conversations he had with focus groups, only make you want to cut the chat and look at the original. </p> <p>Placing Andres Serrano's photos of suckling infants, rat poison suicides and corpses burned to death amongst the artefacts of Catholic faith seems apposite. I look at Serrano's Pieta, then over at a recumbrent knight, carved in stone. As I walk towards his photo of a head of Christ, drowned in milk and water, I see it reflected in a nearby vitrine which contains a tiny, broken, white ivory Christ crucified. Then I'm off again, worrying about the ivory trade. Serrano feels just right here: risky, yet oddly surprising and seamless. He brings the things about him to life. </p> <p>Similarly, Phillip Taafe's paintings, set amongst Islamic carpets, also manage to integrate themselves succesfully, without disappearing. Taafe might be seen as a belated, urbane American abstract Orientalist, but his paintings animate our attention, get us looking again at the gorgeous carpets, at their woven abstract symbolism. </p> <p>Here, dialogues work better than outright interventions, which too often are merely silly, modish, point-scoring. But looking at the new (Marc Quinn's perfectly carved, white marble sculptures of amputees, his one-armed kick-boxer battling between the busts and the Canovas, for example) makes you realise that the new, if it survives at all, will eventually be devoured by the museum. One day it will all be old, and awaiting its own resuscitation. </p> <p>\u0095 Give &amp; Take is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 (020-7402 6075) and the V&amp;A, London SW7 (020-7942 2502), until April 1.</p>",

Both parts of the show, called Give &amp; Take, open to the public today, following a deal brokered between Julia Peyton-Jones, director of the Serpentine, and the soon-to-be- departing V&amp;A director Alan Borg. Objects, as often as they elicit curiosity, can also incite anger. Mixed Messages is a mad conversation piece, in which stories about empire, colonialism, race, sex, religion, class and cultural division collide with the things which represent them. Things have a life of their own; they have histories which refuse to submit to the categories which would contain them. They have a present, as well as a past. Haacke has been described as a conceptual artist, and as an artist concerned with the social conditions of art. He describes his role at the Serpentine, lightly, as \"social secretary\", getting all these things into the building and getting them to talk to one another. The party - if it is one - begins in high Victorian drag, with wallpaper, pot plants, a gilded mirror and commemorative Great Exhibition vases. Albert and Victoria look on, but Richard Billingham's tattooed mum couldn't give a toss, and does a jigsaw in the corner. Cindy Sherman, dressed for a date at Tiffany's, is an actress in search of a role. She's in the wrong movie. Lady Wolverton's more like it, dressed-up as Brittania for an 1897 Devonshire house ball, with her shield and trident. You laugh, but things quickly take another turn, as one would expect from Haacke. He's not really a party animal. When I heard he was showing at the Serpentine, I thought he might do something extreme; for his great work in the German Pavilion in Venice in 1993, he tore up the floor with jack-hammers, leaving us to teeter over the rubble, and to think about Germany's history. Museums can have dark histories, too. Can any such institution avoid looking at its holdings in a guilty light? The climate at the V&amp;A might well be controlled, the air purified, the lighting kind, but all this seeks to do is to nullify, to omit and suppress, to prevent larger stories being told. In part, Haacke's show is a rescue attempt, a way of giving voice to multiple meanings, mul tiple readings. Haacke has also gone for the grand effect, the killer conjunction. In the high-ceilinged North Gallery, the V&amp;A's cast of Michaelangelo's Dying Slave towers queerfully between a large, pained 13th century crucifix and a tranquil Burmese carved and lacquered Buddha. Two Islamic prayer carpets hang on one wall, opposite a Jewish Torah mantle. If this room is a kind of summit of world religions, it is also a place of rootless reverences. The Dying Slave returns us to the body, to profanities and earthly desires, from which the rest is an escape. Through an open doorway into the next gallery, Canova's Sleeping Nymph is showing us her marble bum. I turn, suddenly, to a picture of Polish soldiers having a souvenir photo taken against a sylvan painted backdrop erected by their photographer amidst the rubble of Warsaw in 1942. A second photographer, Marco Jindrich, photographed this farcical event. This little image is a lesson in the fact that, while hundreds of things ultimately dull the spirit, one thing alone can hold you, and burn a hole in your brain. The 1851 Great Exhibition was the progenitor of the V&amp;A. A commemorative painting of the royal opening sits behind a sculpture by Viet-Hong Lien featuring a crying child, a horrified parent and a pile of poo. The big day out always ends in tears. Over at the V&amp;A, amongst the tranquil shelves and cabinets of cups and jugs, plates and figurines in the British porcelain collection, the room is loud with clattering crockery, tinkling teaspoons, the hum of conversation. The roar of school dinner hour, the buzzing restaurant, someone stacking the washing-up. The ambient sound-collage is disturbing here, making the serried rows of Lowestoft, Worcester and Burslem chinaware all the more silent and static in their dust-free vitrines. Neil Cummings and Marysia Lewandowska's soundscape ends with an almighty disaster with the crockery, a great splintering crash of broken plates. \"They're gonna love this,\" said a V&amp;A attendant, \"It's not punters you get up here, it's scholars.\" I have a vision of an amplified soprano amongst the glassware, shattering everything with a high note. The work of the 15 artists placed by Serpentine curator Lisa G Corrin amidst the collections of the V&amp;A have a much tougher time than Haacke. They have to compete. Mostly, they fail, or are merely irritating. Belgian artist Wim Delvoye's hand-carved and decorated life-sized cement mixer - lovingly detailed with florrid foliage and lions' heads by Indonesian craftsman - has almost no impact in the little vestibule where it sits. The museum subsumes it. J Morgan Puett and Suzanne Bocanegra's new tartans - whose colourways and warp and weft are based on New York ethnic and income demographies, inserted amongst the V&amp;A's Tartan collection - almost disappear. Their presence is furtive, which maybe is the point, but as a gesture it is as meek as it is convoluted. Ken Aptegar's repainted details from the V&amp;A's paintings, placed under glass etched with bits of conversations he had with focus groups, only make you want to cut the chat and look at the original. Placing Andres Serrano's photos of suckling infants, rat poison suicides and corpses burned to death amongst the artefacts of Catholic faith seems apposite. I look at Serrano's Pieta, then over at a recumbrent knight, carved in stone. As I walk towards his photo of a head of Christ, drowned in milk and water, I see it reflected in a nearby vitrine which contains a tiny, broken, white ivory Christ crucified. Then I'm off again, worrying about the ivory trade. Serrano feels just right here: risky, yet oddly surprising and seamless. He brings the things about him to life. Similarly, Phillip Taafe's paintings, set amongst Islamic carpets, also manage to integrate themselves succesfully, without disappearing. Taafe might be seen as a belated, urbane American abstract Orientalist, but his paintings animate our attention, get us looking again at the gorgeous carpets, at their woven abstract symbolism. Here, dialogues work better than outright interventions, which too often are merely silly, modish, point-scoring. But looking at the new (Marc Quinn's perfectly carved, white marble sculptures of amputees, his one-armed kick-boxer battling between the busts and the Canovas, for example) makes you realise that the new, if it survives at all, will eventually be devoured by the museum. One day it will all be old, and awaiting its own resuscitation. \u0095 Give &amp; Take is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 (020-7402 6075) and the V&amp;A, London SW7 (020-7942 2502), until April 1.",

The poster ad forms part of a campaign by Brent Council to combat the growing number of shootings in the Harlesden area in recent years. The \"Not Another Drop\" campaign is backed by the Metropolitan Police and the home office and will include radio ads featuring the voice of a mother whose son has been killed. The council is also putting together postcards carrying details of a freepost address to which details about gun crime can be sent anonymously and an Aids-style \"Not Another Drop\" badge in the shape of a drop of blood. \"Harlesden's reputation has been tarnished thanks to the evil activities of a handful of people,\" said councillor Paul Daisley, deputy leader of Brent council. \"The time has come for us to take a stand against these gangsters and the menace they have brought to our streets. We will do all we can to work with the local community and police to force them out.\" Eight people have been killed and 12 injured since 1999 as a result of shootings in the Harlesden area. The campaign was devised in-house.",

Criticism of the university after Ms Spence was rejected was \"completely unfounded\", said Evan Harris, the local Liberal Democrat MP, who has presented evidence on the latest admissions figures to the Commons select committee. In fact, statistics showed that while the great majority of all entrants gained three A grades at A-level, 23% of comprehensive pupils were admitted with slightly lower grades, compared with 17.2% from independent schools. For every 100 places, Oxford colleges typically make 120 offers, expecting 80 applicants to achieve their grades. It was in the 20% of places from candidates who narrowly missed three As or two As and a B that Oxford was giving comprehensive students the benefit of the doubt, Dr Harris believed. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, had said it was \"an absolute scandal\" that Miss Spence, who is now on a scholarship at Harvard in the US, was refused a place to study medicine at Oxford. \"If anything the bias is the other way - and rightly so\", said Dr Harris. Provisional figures from the university show comprehensive pupils with a slightly higher success rate in 1999 for the first time. He pointed out that comprehensive educated students got an identical proportion of first class degrees as former independent school pupils last summer despite getting slightly worse A-levels on average.

      "body": "<p>Imagine you've built a successful organisation based, like Warwick University's economics department, on an outstanding reputation. You are known throughout the world; you turn potential customers away by the thousand. Your reputation is supported by every external indicator of your past performance; it's never been questioned. </p> <p>Then, out of the blue, someone slanders you. You have to go to court to defend yourself. The jury must absorb a hundred witnesses and 20,000 pages of documents - all inside three days - and the judge will let private opinions and hearsay count in evidence too. </p> <p>The quality of your rhetoric is likely to weigh more heavily than documents and expert witnesses. The best you can hope for is that the judge will find in your favour, with no damages and no order for costs. Every penny you've spent, all the months of preparation, are gone for ever. The trial process is so flawed that you could lose your case and your reputation, and be left with nothing. There is no provision for appeal. </p> <p>This is the system of teaching quality review that has been imposed throughout England's universities and is operated by the QAA - the so-called Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. Economics at Warwick has just been reviewed, and we obtained the maximum score: 24 out of 24. This point is worth making in capital letters so that you know: we would not recognise a sour grape if we stood on one. Our economists have played this system and won. </p> <p>Do we delight in a deserved vic tory? Are we pleased that other university departments in this nation will be subjected to the same rigour? No, our frank conclusion is that it is probably the most damaging and destructive system of regulation that could possibly have been devised. Before we say why, let's make it clear that we have only praise for the underpaid, overworked academics who conscientiously reviewed us on the lines laid down by the QAA. The procedures are at fault, not the people who operate them. </p> <p>Let's start with this department's score. Our full marks should place us among the country's elite. The world will think that, anyway. As for ourselves, we do believe we're very, very good (though not perfect). But our belief is not based on our QAA \"teaching quality\" score, which does not remotely measure teaching quality in this or any other department. </p> <p>There are many possible illusions about the QAA process. Get your notepads out. </p> <p><strong> Illusion 1 </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Warwick's perfect QAA score tells parents that our teaching quality is the best.</strong> </p> <p>Wrong. QAA only measures the claims that each institution makes about its teaching quality. We made high claims for our teaching quality, and the QAA panel agreed; so we got full marks. A department that made lesser claims, and proved them, would get full marks too. So you can't compare a 24 for economics at Warwick with the score from anywhere else. These QAA numbers are virtually useless. Yet nobody explains this to parents, teachers, or newspapers. </p> <p><strong> Illusion 2 The QAA has measured teaching quality objectively at Warwick.</strong><br> </p> <p>Wrong. The method is not scientific. We supplied the hypothesis, the evidence and the witnesses. We chose the students, the former students and employers, the samples of student work, and the internal documentation to be seen by the panel. (Without a word being said, our students grasped perfectly the incentives at work: the more they supported us, the more their degrees would be worth.) </p> <p>Finally, we managed the stage. We chose the meeting rooms, the seating plans, and which of us would perform as advocates. We trained ourselves in theatre and rhetoric; we learnt to argue fluently with passion and conviction. We were barristers in our own defence. </p> <p>In other words we, who had the clearest possible interest in the outcome, also had a decisive influence on the hypothesis, the evidence, and the trial process. We did it well, but it wasn't objective. </p> <p><strong> Illusion 3 </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> QAA scores can measure the change in teaching quality at Warwick</strong> </p> <p>Wrong. The QAA's methodology is so unstable that it never uses the same criteria twice. In the previous cycle the scoring system was different, and it will be different next time round as well. Each time, the criteria change. Because it's never done the same way, anyone wanting to make useful comparisons over time cannot begin to know how teaching quality is altering. </p> <p><strong> Illusion 4 The QAA aims to enhance teaching quality in universities</strong><br> </p> <p>Wrong. The QAA aims to enhance confidence in teaching quality, not teaching quality. Read the rubric. Its mission is \"to promote public confidence that quality of provision and standards of awards in higher education are being safeguarded and enhanced.\" It's there to \"assure\", not \"ensure\". The whole thing is a hugely expensive public relations exercise. </p> <p><strong> Illusion 5 </strong> <strong> QAA reviews are cost-effective</strong><br> </p> <p>Almost certainly wrong. Within the QAA methodology there is no attempt to compare costs with benefits, and no limit to the costs which universities are expected to incur in order to comply with bureaucratic criteria. Yes, we have found some benefits (whoopee). But that is like finding that when you fall out of an aeroplane you get a good view on the way down. </p> <p>These benefits are vastly out weighed by the process's immense costs. Our estimate is that in preparing for the review over the past year our one department has spent \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3200,000 in staff time alone (ten times this sum at business consultancy rates). Multiply by the departments reviewed annually and add the overheads, and the hidden costs of QAA regulation are of the order of a hundred million pounds a year. </p> <p>A still greater cost is not reckoned here at all. Teaching quality rests at its heart on the teachers' inner motivation. We're not well paid by the standards of the business world; the reason we do university economics is because we want to. Nothing could be more destructive to this motivation than the distrust and adversarial spirit that pervades QAA methodology. </p> <p>Increasingly, we are forced to do things because the QAA says so and threatens us if we don't, not because true teaching quality demands it. Enthusiasm and scholarship are being strangled by bureaucratic monitor ing and demands for paper trails. </p> <p>Universities don't ask for irresponsible control over the public money that pays us. We're willing to be called to account. There is a case for regulation. But not like this. </p> <p>True teaching quality is being wrecked by a self-interested lobby of regulators. John Randall, head of the QAA, was quoted last week as saying that the intensity of regulation should rise with the level of fees. The bigger the cake, the more they want to get their hands on our crumbs. </p> <p>We have to stop the QAA monster or it will eat us alive. </p> <p><strong>Mark Harrison, Ben Lockwood, Marcus Miller, Andrew Oswald, Mark Stewart, Ian Walker</strong> are all professors of economics at Warwick University, and helped to prepare and present their department's case during an inspection by the nation's Quality Assurance Agency.<br></p> <p><strong>QAA: The true score</strong></p> <p>About 10,000 people - most of them academics - have been involved in inspecting universities and higher education colleges in the UK over the past seven years.

QAA: The true score About 10,000 people - most of them academics - have been involved in inspecting universities and higher education colleges in the UK over the past seven years. More than 2,000 individual institutions have been reviewed for Teaching Quality Assessments. Currently they are scored on six aspects - curriculum design, teaching, student achievement, student support, resources, and quality management - out of a possible 24 points. This year new \"lighter touch\" academic reviews are being introduced, initially in Scotland, in which the points system will be dropped. The period between reviews is being shortened from eight to six years. The inspection regime (though the word \"inspection\" is never used) was the hotly contested outcome of the Conservative government's insistence that the higher education sector must be more accountable for the billions of public money being spent on it. Universities, and their supporters in the House of Lords, protested about threats to academic freedom and secured safeguards to prevent the education secretary or his funding councils closing down courses they disapproved of - peace studies was the example at the time. Traditionally universities have drawn up their own degree courses and guaranteed standards themselves with the help of a fairly informal system of external examiners from other universities. The polytechnics were overseen by a central body until they gained the right to award their own degrees. The agency audits institutions' own procedures and scrutinises the education offered in each subject, judged against their own objectives. Donald Macleod",

      "body": "<p>Five years from now, if today's vexing plumber scarcity is just a painful memory and the Yellow Pages burst with ads for leisure consultants and nail technicians, David Blunkett will be looking for some credit. Last week, as part of a transformation of the secondary sector planned for the Blair government's anticipated second term, he announced \"ambitious plans\" to introduce a range of new Vocational GCSEs into schools. </p> <p>Starting on a small scale from 2002, Year 9 pupils considering their options for the following two years will not be restricted to the narrow, overwhelmingly academic choice the national curriculum presently offers. Everyone will have to do English, maths and science, but there will also be courses starting them on the road to being electricians or engineers, caterers or keyboard jockeys, retail managers or tour organisers, often linked to workplace experience. Vocational GCSEs, Blunkett pledged, would be central to a drive to \"raise the standard of vocational study and training, and draw together the worlds of education and work in ways that have never before been achieved\". </p> <p>So what's it all about? Precise details are sketchy, but it seems there may be a GCSE called something like Applied Technology, which will be of relevance to potential builders, joiners, mechanics and, yes, electricians and plumbers. It also appears that the new qualifications will cover many of the same subject areas as the General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) they will replace. These currently include art and design, leisure and tourism, the performing arts, health and social care, hospitality and catering, and information and communications technology. Many schools already offer these (at advanced level too) to children who find the more academic disciplines difficult or boring. </p> <p>GNVQs have a credibility problem, however: employers don't respect them, most schools don't prioritise them, and many pupils who study them see them as a badge of failure. </p> <p>Raising the status of vocational qualifications is central to the government's plan. But how well will it work? Will an exam pass in what is conventionally thought of as a \"practical\" subject ever be regarded by anyone as equal to an academic counterpart?

      "bodyText": "Five years from now, if today's vexing plumber scarcity is just a painful memory and the Yellow Pages burst with ads for leisure consultants and nail technicians, David Blunkett will be looking for some credit. Last week, as part of a transformation of the secondary sector planned for the Blair government's anticipated second term, he announced \"ambitious plans\" to introduce a range of new Vocational GCSEs into schools. Starting on a small scale from 2002, Year 9 pupils considering their options for the following two years will not be restricted to the narrow, overwhelmingly academic choice the national curriculum presently offers. Everyone will have to do English, maths and science, but there will also be courses starting them on the road to being electricians or engineers, caterers or keyboard jockeys, retail managers or tour organisers, often linked to workplace experience. Vocational GCSEs, Blunkett pledged, would be central to a drive to \"raise the standard of vocational study and training, and draw together the worlds of education and work in ways that have never before been achieved\". So what's it all about? Precise details are sketchy, but it seems there may be a GCSE called something like Applied Technology, which will be of relevance to potential builders, joiners, mechanics and, yes, electricians and plumbers. It also appears that the new qualifications will cover many of the same subject areas as the General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) they will replace. These currently include art and design, leisure and tourism, the performing arts, health and social care, hospitality and catering, and information and communications technology. Many schools already offer these (at advanced level too) to children who find the more academic disciplines difficult or boring. GNVQs have a credibility problem, however: employers don't respect them, most schools don't prioritise them, and many pupils who study them see them as a badge of failure. Raising the status of vocational qualifications is central to the government's plan. But how well will it work? Will an exam pass in what is conventionally thought of as a \"practical\" subject ever be regarded by anyone as equal to an academic counterpart? Even keen supporters of the move have spoken of a risk that some of the effects may turn out to be the opposite of what's intended: instead of \"levelling up\" the status of vocational courses by running them directly alongside academic ones, giving them the same name, and saying they are just as good, will the result simply be to institutionalise a two-tier system within schools, whereby the intellectual elite is confirmed as precisely that and the vocational rest, just second best? Significantly, NUT General Secretary Doug McAvoy and the Confederation of British Industry have responded in similar ways. Both have praised the principle, but have concerns about implementation. McAvoy warns against reviving the old grammar-secondary modern divide and putting youngsters on a narrow course towards a particular trade or career too soon: \"The government must take care not to create vocational ghettos instead of ensuring that all our young people benefit from a broad general education which widens their horizons.\" Anne Lindsay, a policy adviser with the CBI's Learning and Skills Group, makes compatible points.

      "bodyText": "Survival Anglia, which has produced wildlife programmes for the past 40 years, is the latest victim of the rise of \"popular wildlife\" programming. The prestigious programming unit behind hit shows including Flight of the Snow Geese and the famous documentary about the flora and fauna of the Prince of Wales's residence at Highgrove, is closing due to market pressures. Granada confirmed today it plans to close the Survival office in Norwich, and would relocate it to Bristol under Tom Archer, United's head of factual programmes. Under the plans, between 25 and 35 of the 40 staff who work for Survival Anglia in Norwich will be made redundant, although a spokesman was unable to give any clear indication of what would happen to remaining staff. And it is understood that a further 15 posts could be cut at United's Bristol base as the Survival staff are merged with the existing natural history programming department. Broadcasting union Bectu reacted with anger at the proposed cuts. Bectu supervisory official Sharon Elliott said the loss of Survival Anglia was \"a major loss\". Granada attributed the move to the \"changing demands of UK and international broadcasters\". It said that markets were \"hungry for popular documentary techniques, the use of presenters and the inclusion of more science\". In a statement the company said: \"With Bristol already acknowledged as the world capital of wildlife film making, the new department will now be in an even stronger position to expand into the international market and be fully prepared to take advantage of broadband and new media opportunities.\" But insiders have condemned the decision as an attempt to be \"trendy\". Presenter-led programming, with the likes of ITV's Steve Irwin and Nigel Marven, has stolen a march on more traditional wildlife programming. Ms Elliott of Bectu continued: \"It is unacceptable to us that Granada Media should want to show talented and experienced staff the door at operations which are already run efficiently.\" The move is the latest fallout from the takeover by Granada of United Broadcasting.

Viewers were shocked to see panellists repeat a popular football terrace chant about Posh Spice's sexual preferences. The programme complaints unit upheld complaints from a viewer about a \"gross and poisonous\" attack on Mr and Mrs Beckham during one edition of the show. And the remark, made by panellist Rory McGrath and others, is to be edited out of repeats of the show. The ruling will be a victory for Mrs Beckham, who has had public slanging matches with Mr McGrath in the past. She called him \"that ugly bastard\" in a magazine interview. The BBC programme complaints unit found the programme \"went beyond even the broad limits\" of the programme, renowned for its bawdy humour. \"The Beckhams are no strangers to publicity and, as a couple so much in the public eye, are a legitimate target for the programme's humour.

On top of the three unlawful arrests a further four of the charges were not investigated to an acceptable prosecution standard</p> <p>The report also criticised procedures at police stations, concluding custody sergeants \"readily accepted the evidence given to them by the arresting officers, even where no prima facie evidence existed to substantiate a formal charge.\"</p> <p>Mr Lindo has always maintained that part of the reason he was subjected to harassment was because of his friendship with Winston Silcott, the man wrongly convicted of murdering PC Keith Blakelock during the Broadwater Farm riots in north London in 1985.</p> <p>The inquiry team found no evidence of an organised conspiracy to harass Mr and Mrs Lindo. \"There was, however, evidence that harassment had taken place because of the negative stereotyping of the Lindo family,\" the report said.</p> <p>\"This had been caused by police officers in Haringey focusing on the fact that Mr Lindo has spent convictions, including one for rape, which \"led to a disproportionate number of interactions with the Lindo family.\"</p> <p>But the report said the Lindos were \"partly instrumental in creating the spiral of deteriorating relationships and reciprocated the negative, aggressive and un professional behaviour exhibited by certain police officers.\"</p> <p>The couple exhibited \"extremes of behaviour\" that led to \"overreaction by the police and the punitive use of the judicial system\".</p> <p>However, the report concluded: \"Notwithstanding this intense and at times arguably provocative behaviour by the Lindo family, the Metropolitan police is at fault in its lack of strategic response to this series of incidents, its punitive overreaction on occasions, poor supervision of events, arrests, prosecutions, complaints and mediation.\"</p> <p>The inquiry also found the family was subjected to more than its fair share of inquiries by the police. Between 1996 and 2000, Mr Lindo was the subject of 52 intelligence reports. \"The number of intelligence reports recorded by the police at Haringey is disproportionately high,\" the report concluded.</p> <p>The report also found that inappropriate comments amounting to \"stereotypical and frivolous behaviour towards the Lindo family\" were also disproportionately high in the intelligence reports. One of the conclusions Mr Ghaffur made was \"the need for a quality control of inappropriate language used on criminal reports\".</p> <p><b> Collective failures</b><br></p> <p>Mr Ghaffur said the general conclusion was that there did not appear to be any conspiracy by individual officers or a cadre of officers within the Metropolitan police. \"However, when all factors are collectively considered, including anomalies in the use of discretion, legal powers, stereotyping, disproportionality and organisational failings, then the inquiry finds that harassment of the Lindo family took place.\"</p> <p>He said that the findings would \"seriously challenge\" the Met and those concerned with its good management.</p> <p>The report concluded the force in the borough of Haringey lacked \"the competency, or will (or both) to detect over a number of years major weaknesses\".</p> <p>The report added that the processes examined, such as the duty of custody sergeants to ensure there is enough evidence to substantiate a charge, had been generally ignored or incompetently performed. \"Moreover, this sloppiness seems endemic to the investigative and the whole criminal justice function within the borough.\"</p> <p>It warned that the collective failures \"have put the Metropolitan police service at a serious risk of undermining the confidence of sections of minority ethnic communities within the borough of Haringey\".</p> <p>However, the report added that while the Lindo family had been to a large extent the victims of \"unprofessional standards and management\" by the Met, \"this inquiry in attributing liability also feels that the Lindo family, to a much lesser extent, have contributed to some of their own misfortune.\"</p> <p>Ian Blair told the Guardian that parts of the report made \"uncomfortable reading\" and that some of the findings were \"concerning\". \"What I want is to move forwards. The priority is to achieve a situation in which levels of suspicion between the core participants in this story are reduced. To achieve that you need a transparent, accountable policing style.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair defended the fact that none of the police officers involved were to face disciplinary action.</p> <p>\"The unlawful arrests have been subject to investigation already. This process is not designed to and has not thrown up any new disciplinary matters.\"</p> <p>Commenting on the findings , Mr Lindo said: \"I do have a few points that I contest as the police have a few points they contest. But in general the report is a vindication of everything we have fought for. The conclusion is that police harass people and target people, especially people with previous convictions, which has to be worrying for all those people in society who have got spent convictions.\"</p> <p>Lee Jasper, race adviser to the Greater London Metropolitan police authority, said that even the diluted final version was \"a shocking indictment of a racist and bullying police culture and has profound implications which will reinforce the Macpherson recommendations.\"</p> <p>\u0095Evidence of harassment because of stereotyping of Mr Lindo and his family, although there is no evidence of an organised conspiracy to harass them because of their connection with the Winston Silcott campaign.</p> <p>\u0095Disproportionate number of arrests of the Lindo family. Three were unlawful, while a further four were not investigated to an acceptable prosecution standard. There was also evidence of a misuse of discretion of police powers and inappropriate comments within intelligence reports and official documents.</p> <p>\u0095Anomalies in file completion, management and supervision all played a part in what amounted to a collective organisational failure in the policing of these incidents in the borough of Haringey over a number of years.</p> <p>\u0095Mr and Mrs Lindo were partly instrumental in creating the spiral of deteriorating relationships. At times they exhibited extremes of behaviour.</p> <p>The collective failures have put the Metropolitan police at a serious risk of undermining the confidence of sections of ethnic communities in the borough of Haringey. Lessons from the inquiry should be used to improve the operational effectiveness of the Met</p> <p>\u0095The Met should take matters forward , beginning with an apology to the Lindo family, followed by mediation and confidence building measures.</p> <p>A fairness audit will create foundations and underpin the community race awareness training for police in the borough.</p>",

On top of the three unlawful arrests a further four of the charges were not investigated to an acceptable prosecution standard The report also criticised procedures at police stations, concluding custody sergeants \"readily accepted the evidence given to them by the arresting officers, even where no prima facie evidence existed to substantiate a formal charge.\" Mr Lindo has always maintained that part of the reason he was subjected to harassment was because of his friendship with Winston Silcott, the man wrongly convicted of murdering PC Keith Blakelock during the Broadwater Farm riots in north London in 1985. The inquiry team found no evidence of an organised conspiracy to harass Mr and Mrs Lindo. \"There was, however, evidence that harassment had taken place because of the negative stereotyping of the Lindo family,\" the report said. \"This had been caused by police officers in Haringey focusing on the fact that Mr Lindo has spent convictions, including one for rape, which \"led to a disproportionate number of interactions with the Lindo family.\" But the report said the Lindos were \"partly instrumental in creating the spiral of deteriorating relationships and reciprocated the negative, aggressive and un professional behaviour exhibited by certain police officers.\" The couple exhibited \"extremes of behaviour\" that led to \"overreaction by the police and the punitive use of the judicial system\". However, the report concluded: \"Notwithstanding this intense and at times arguably provocative behaviour by the Lindo family, the Metropolitan police is at fault in its lack of strategic response to this series of incidents, its punitive overreaction on occasions, poor supervision of events, arrests, prosecutions, complaints and mediation.\" The inquiry also found the family was subjected to more than its fair share of inquiries by the police. Between 1996 and 2000, Mr Lindo was the subject of 52 intelligence reports. \"The number of intelligence reports recorded by the police at Haringey is disproportionately high,\" the report concluded. The report also found that inappropriate comments amounting to \"stereotypical and frivolous behaviour towards the Lindo family\" were also disproportionately high in the intelligence reports. One of the conclusions Mr Ghaffur made was \"the need for a quality control of inappropriate language used on criminal reports\". Collective failures Mr Ghaffur said the general conclusion was that there did not appear to be any conspiracy by individual officers or a cadre of officers within the Metropolitan police. \"However, when all factors are collectively considered, including anomalies in the use of discretion, legal powers, stereotyping, disproportionality and organisational failings, then the inquiry finds that harassment of the Lindo family took place.\" He said that the findings would \"seriously challenge\" the Met and those concerned with its good management. The report concluded the force in the borough of Haringey lacked \"the competency, or will (or both) to detect over a number of years major weaknesses\". The report added that the processes examined, such as the duty of custody sergeants to ensure there is enough evidence to substantiate a charge, had been generally ignored or incompetently performed. \"Moreover, this sloppiness seems endemic to the investigative and the whole criminal justice function within the borough.\" It warned that the collective failures \"have put the Metropolitan police service at a serious risk of undermining the confidence of sections of minority ethnic communities within the borough of Haringey\". However, the report added that while the Lindo family had been to a large extent the victims of \"unprofessional standards and management\" by the Met, \"this inquiry in attributing liability also feels that the Lindo family, to a much lesser extent, have contributed to some of their own misfortune.\" Ian Blair told the Guardian that parts of the report made \"uncomfortable reading\" and that some of the findings were \"concerning\". \"What I want is to move forwards. The priority is to achieve a situation in which levels of suspicion between the core participants in this story are reduced. To achieve that you need a transparent, accountable policing style.\" Mr Blair defended the fact that none of the police officers involved were to face disciplinary action. \"The unlawful arrests have been subject to investigation already. This process is not designed to and has not thrown up any new disciplinary matters.\" Commenting on the findings , Mr Lindo said: \"I do have a few points that I contest as the police have a few points they contest. But in general the report is a vindication of everything we have fought for. The conclusion is that police harass people and target people, especially people with previous convictions, which has to be worrying for all those people in society who have got spent convictions.\" Lee Jasper, race adviser to the Greater London Metropolitan police authority, said that even the diluted final version was \"a shocking indictment of a racist and bullying police culture and has profound implications which will reinforce the Macpherson recommendations.\" \u0095Evidence of harassment because of stereotyping of Mr Lindo and his family, although there is no evidence of an organised conspiracy to harass them because of their connection with the Winston Silcott campaign. \u0095Disproportionate number of arrests of the Lindo family. Three were unlawful, while a further four were not investigated to an acceptable prosecution standard. There was also evidence of a misuse of discretion of police powers and inappropriate comments within intelligence reports and official documents. \u0095Anomalies in file completion, management and supervision all played a part in what amounted to a collective organisational failure in the policing of these incidents in the borough of Haringey over a number of years. \u0095Mr and Mrs Lindo were partly instrumental in creating the spiral of deteriorating relationships. At times they exhibited extremes of behaviour. The collective failures have put the Metropolitan police at a serious risk of undermining the confidence of sections of ethnic communities in the borough of Haringey. Lessons from the inquiry should be used to improve the operational effectiveness of the Met \u0095The Met should take matters forward , beginning with an apology to the Lindo family, followed by mediation and confidence building measures. A fairness audit will create foundations and underpin the community race awareness training for police in the borough.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>GREG THE PEG</strong></p> <p>It seems like only three days ago that John Gregory, football's Mr Live Fast, Die Young, was tearing out of Villa Park on the back of a hog on a mission to sign (another) new striker. In fact it was only three days ago, and in the middle of Villa's ultimately disappointing, nay rubbish, Cup defeat at the feet of Leicester City. Greg had pelted away from the ground in order to fly to Spain and watch Alaves striker Javi Moreno in action. Just as well it wasn't a completely wasted journey then, eh?</p> <p>\"Get away! I haven't had contact with anyone,\" Moreno said today. \"I want to leave the subject closed. I wish to finish the season in Alaves and then we will see. I don't want to say too much. I can guarantee that I haven't signed anything with anyone and whoever says that I have is lying.\" Which is a fairly definitive statement whichever way you look at it (apart from upside down, when it simply becomes confusing).</p> <p>Which leaves Greg in a right old Joachim of a situation. The man who, only 18 months ago, was trumpeting the cause of buying British, now can't land the foreign talent he so desperately wants. Another prospective deal, to bring Colombian Mauricio Serna to the club, is dependent on Gregory raising the necessary funds. Which means that, according to reports, true Brits Gareth Southgate, Dion Dublin and Julian Joachim are all up for grabs to the highest bidder. Vroom! Vroom!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>MARKO DISTINCTION</strong></p> <p>Think of number between one and nine. Now multiply it by seven and add 100. Providing you have a rudimentary knowledge of the seven times table - and if you haven't, why wasn't it caned into you at school? - you should now have a large number in your mind's eye. As large as it may be, the Fiver is quietly confident that number falls short of 167, which happens to be the rather high combined age of Arsenal's first choice defence. </p> <p>With Lee Dixon pushing 37, and Tony Adams and Martin Keown both 34, Arsene's Arsenal Wenger either needs to find an Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade style elixir of youth (pick the carpenter's cup, Arsene!) or bring in players that offer QVC - quality, versatility and cost-effectiveness. Which is where Hertha Berlin's Marko Rehmer comes in. At 28, Rehmer is just out of kindergarten as far as the Gunners are concerned. Better still, he can play in centre half, midfield or full-back and has 16 caps for Germany. And Rehmer even has a clause in his contract that states he can leave Hertha for 16m Deutsche marks (which is \u00a35m at current exchange rates). </p> <p>So is a deal close? According to reports in this morning's papers, Rehmer, who recently visited Arsenal's training facilities in London Colney, was practically on the plane over. But this afternoon Rehmer's agent Hans Joerg Neubauer poured a large jug of ice-cold water on such talk. \"He is in talks with a number of clubs,\" said Neubauer. \"I do not want to give a statement naming any clubs at the moment because we are in talks with some clubs. I will be able to say more in about two weeks.\" And with these some clubs reported to be Juventus, AC Milan and Fiorentina, Arsene may have to return to the adding board.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"It's not about touting - that's monster rubbish.

This time the target was shaven-headed midfielder Ivan de la Pena, who was assaulted in his home yesterday after being stalked all day by an unnamed 35-year-old (which rules out He Was He Is Emmanuel Petit). </p> <p>Last month police arrested a 32-year-old man outside the Barca training ground - he later confessed to planning the kidnap of a member of the squad.

      "bodyText": "GREG THE PEG It seems like only three days ago that John Gregory, football's Mr Live Fast, Die Young, was tearing out of Villa Park on the back of a hog on a mission to sign (another) new striker. In fact it was only three days ago, and in the middle of Villa's ultimately disappointing, nay rubbish, Cup defeat at the feet of Leicester City. Greg had pelted away from the ground in order to fly to Spain and watch Alaves striker Javi Moreno in action. Just as well it wasn't a completely wasted journey then, eh? \"Get away! I haven't had contact with anyone,\" Moreno said today. \"I want to leave the subject closed. I wish to finish the season in Alaves and then we will see. I don't want to say too much. I can guarantee that I haven't signed anything with anyone and whoever says that I have is lying.\" Which is a fairly definitive statement whichever way you look at it (apart from upside down, when it simply becomes confusing). Which leaves Greg in a right old Joachim of a situation. The man who, only 18 months ago, was trumpeting the cause of buying British, now can't land the foreign talent he so desperately wants. Another prospective deal, to bring Colombian Mauricio Serna to the club, is dependent on Gregory raising the necessary funds. Which means that, according to reports, true Brits Gareth Southgate, Dion Dublin and Julian Joachim are all up for grabs to the highest bidder. Vroom! Vroom! * * * * * * * * * * * * * MARKO DISTINCTION Think of number between one and nine. Now multiply it by seven and add 100. Providing you have a rudimentary knowledge of the seven times table - and if you haven't, why wasn't it caned into you at school? - you should now have a large number in your mind's eye. As large as it may be, the Fiver is quietly confident that number falls short of 167, which happens to be the rather high combined age of Arsenal's first choice defence. With Lee Dixon pushing 37, and Tony Adams and Martin Keown both 34, Arsene's Arsenal Wenger either needs to find an Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade style elixir of youth (pick the carpenter's cup, Arsene!) or bring in players that offer QVC - quality, versatility and cost-effectiveness. Which is where Hertha Berlin's Marko Rehmer comes in. At 28, Rehmer is just out of kindergarten as far as the Gunners are concerned. Better still, he can play in centre half, midfield or full-back and has 16 caps for Germany. And Rehmer even has a clause in his contract that states he can leave Hertha for 16m Deutsche marks (which is \u00a35m at current exchange rates). So is a deal close? According to reports in this morning's papers, Rehmer, who recently visited Arsenal's training facilities in London Colney, was practically on the plane over. But this afternoon Rehmer's agent Hans Joerg Neubauer poured a large jug of ice-cold water on such talk. \"He is in talks with a number of clubs,\" said Neubauer. \"I do not want to give a statement naming any clubs at the moment because we are in talks with some clubs. I will be able to say more in about two weeks.\" And with these some clubs reported to be Juventus, AC Milan and Fiorentina, Arsene may have to return to the adding board. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It's not about touting - that's monster rubbish. I just try to make clubs aware of players that are free. If I'm an actor in the West End, I want someone to find me the best play and the best deal - it's the same with footballers.\" Eric Hall, who else, responds to a proposal by the FA's vice-chairman David Dein to ban agents touting players prior to transfer. * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'NAP HAND Some children collect Dairylea triangles. Others collect, and sell, crack cocaine. But only Catalan nutters, it seems, are intent on collecting professional football players. For the second time in two months, police have foiled the attempted kidnap of a Barcelona player. This time the target was shaven-headed midfielder Ivan de la Pena, who was assaulted in his home yesterday after being stalked all day by an unnamed 35-year-old (which rules out He Was He Is Emmanuel Petit). Last month police arrested a 32-year-old man outside the Barca training ground - he later confessed to planning the kidnap of a member of the squad. The loon was looking for a big ransom to pay off his business debts, but because he was a non-football supporting mentalist, didn't know which one to nab. The news comes at a bad time, with the imminent arrival of Stanley Victor Collymore on Spanish shores. Stanley, who is expected to complete his move to Real Oviedo today, would be an obvious target for any loon. No insult intended to Oviedo director general Felix Ortega. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal could sign Brazil international Ronaldinho on loan, according to reports. Ronaldinho's move from Gremio to Paris St Germain has been held up by red tape, and reports from France suggest that PSG may allow him to join the Gunners on loan while the matter is resolved. FC Copenhagen striker David Nielsen is set for a \u00a3450,000 move to Sheffield Wednesday, according to his agent. Sunderland are interested in signing 6ft 7ins Anderlecht striker Jan Koller for \u00a39m. Fulham have been linked with a move bid for Bradford City striker Benito Carbone. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Manchester United are planning to re-turf the playing surface at Old Trafford following their 1-0 FA Cup defeat to West Ham. The club president of Serie A side Verona, Giambattista Pastorello, claims he is unlikely to sign a black player because it would prompt a backlash from his club's racist fans. Asked about a rumour that Verona striker Emiliano Bonazzoli would move to Parma, with Patrick Mboma heading the opposite way, Pastorello said it was unlikely. \"If you have fans that do these things you need to have patience,\" he said. \"Our supporters have behaved badly, at least in regard to coloured players\". Paulo Wanchope may not have played his last game for Manchester City despite being transfer-listed. \"We'll get tomorrow out of the way and then we'll see,\" said manager Joe Royle. Blackburn Rovers midfielder David Dunn has signed a new four-year contract. Leicester have signed Gillingham midfielder Junior Lewis on a month's loan. York's fixture with Carlisle will go ahead tonight after the Bootham Crescent pitch passed an afternoon inspection. Sheffield Wednesday have signed a new three-year kit sponsorship deal with Diadora. Sunderland have named former brewery executive Hugh Roberts as their new chief executive. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Football Extra (3.20am) \"Hi, I'm Bert Bartlecek of Bogle, Bogle and Bogle Consultants (now known as Smartcasual).

      "bodyText": "The BBC has finally admitted it is planning an international news website that will be funded by advertising. Caroline Thomson, director of public policy at the corporation, said the notion of a commercially-funded international online news service was \"at an early stage of development\". However, she attempted to play down the significance of the move by insisting the websites would not simply be rubber-stamped by corporation bosses. \"If such a proposal were to come to fruition it would, of course, have to pass the BBC governors who act independently on behalf of the public interest, would require DCMS approval, and would be subject to all the usual UK and EU competition laws,\" she said. Ms Thomson's letter follows a week of protest from commercial rivals who say the BBC should not be allowed to use public money to compete in the private setor. Up to now the BBC has played down the initiative, which has been hatched during a series of clandestine conferences code-amed 'Hever'. Ms Thomson's letter, written for this week's issue of internet trade magazine Industry Standard, opens up the idea of a commercially-funded public service website for public debate. \"I think this is a means of addressing the questions that have been raised around the issue of BBCNews.com, as well as an opportunity of giving the BBC point of view,\" said a spokesman for the BBC. BBC critics, however, reacted angrily.

More than 1,500 copies of the book The Big Breach were last night flown into the country from Russia by online information company 192.com, which claimed to be \"defenders of the right to freedom of information\". Only 10,000 copies of the book have been printed by unknown Russian publishing house Narodny Variant. In a special arrangement with the publishers, 192.com said it had secured 5,000 copies for the British public. Tomlinson, who worked for MI6 between 1991 to 1995, was jailed in 1997 for breaching the Official Secrets Act and now lives in Italy. He reveals how the British intelligence services perfected a means of invisible writing using a humble Pentel pen. British authorities have already attempted to stop publication of Tomlinson's revelations in a series of extracts in the Sunday Times. But last week the Court of Appeal ruled that once the book was in the public domain, it could be made available in the UK. Nuala Whelan, sales and marketing director for 192.com, said the company was committed to promoting the freedom of information and access to all data. It has already been criticised by privacy campaigners for making it possible to find the home address of anyone registered to vote in Britain. Ms Whelan said: \"It is not that we are supporting the publication of secrets from Russia, but the book has been published. \"If the information is available to people in Russia, it should also be available to the British.\" Allegations have been made by the prominent Soviet defector, Oleg Gordievsky, a former high-ranking KGB officer, that the Russian secret service has doctored the memoirs in an attempt to undermine the British secret service. But 192.com issued a qualification with each copy of the new book stating that it made no judgment on its merits or authenticity. It warned that the book was published in Russia \"in circumstances which seem as much cloak-and-dagger as the story itself\". \"We make no judgment on the merits of this book or the authenticity of the whole.

      "bodyText": "In a move that will resonate with the British government's aim to embrace faith-based organisations, US president George Bush is attempting to tap religious institutions for more charitable work. On Monday, President Bush established a White House office that would distribute billions of dollars to religious groups and charities over the next 10 years. The president wants to allow such groups to compete for taxpayer's money to provide after-school programmes, prison ministries and drug treatment, among other activities. To build support, the president will meet leaders of spiritual and charitable groups throughout this week and he plans to attend the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday. Earlier this month, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the importance of faith-based organisations in galvanising volunteers when he announced his \u00a3300m funding package for voluntary organisations over the next three years. Critics in the US say using public money for such programmes could violate the separation between church and state.

With its echoes of Christian doctrine and the words of the burial service, \"earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust\", this ancient principle was brought into legal argument when the artist Anthony-Noel Kelly was tried in 1998 for theft of anatomical specimens from the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). It was at Kelly's trial that this principle was overturned, and that some of the issues under debate regarding Alder Hey were prefigured.</p> <p>Kelly and an accomplice had removed anatomical specimens from a basement store at the RCS. Kelly made moulds from the specimens, which he then cast in plaster and embellished with precious metals. While not denying that he took the specimens to further his work, he pleaded not guilty to the charge of theft since, at the time he took them, there was no precedent for corpses being regarded as property, and the lesser trespass of \"outraging public decency\" prevailed.</p> <p>In order to gain a conviction for theft, it was necessary to establish that the corpses in question had some status as property. To whom did these particular body parts belong? Unidentifiable due to the length of time they had been stored, it was impossible to tract the next of kin, or to establish rights of possession by the college under contemporary licence law.</p> <p>However, Judge Rivlin did rule that the specimens were the property of the RCS: because of the \"skilled work\" carried out upon them by \"a previous generation\" of surgeons. In his summing up, Judge Rivlin asked the jury to consider whether the defendants a) took the body parts; b) intended to deprive the \"owners\" of the property permanently; and c) were acting dishonestly. These are all questions which might be raised with regard to Alder Hey.</p> <p>His case exposed irregularities in storage of bodies donated for medial research, and also fuelled public concern about commercial interest - in this case of an artist - in dealing with the dead. The benefits of medical research are undeniable, but the use of human material by pharmaceutical companies sponsoring research is subject to commercial interests - which extend beyond what many would consider \"legitimate\" medical research to the cosmetic industry. </p> <p>Dr Ruth Richardson, who has contributed to the Alder Hey inquiry, medical historian and author of Death, Dissection and the Destitute (a comprehensive study of the background and consequences of the 1832 Anatomy Act), submitted evidence to the recent chief medical officer's summit on organs and consent. In the new edition of her book, she discusses the \"fearful symmetry\" of commercial and social conditions prevailing in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (which led to sale of stolen corpses to anatomy schools for dissection) and conditions surrounding organ transplant and the research industry today. </p> <p>Unless the government acts to ensure that human material will never be bought and sold, we face a return to the kind of conditions which led to the 1832 Act where unregulated trade in human corpses put the public at risk.</p> <p>As Dr Richardson points out, the human corpse again has a commercial value unprecedented since the 1832 Act. Dr Richardson advises that we learn the lessons of medical history, and ensure that the human body is never bought or sold, but rather used in fully understood, consenting donation. However, this question remains: does current law sufficiently cover the question of ownership of the body under contemporary conditions for consent to be effectively protected?</p> <p>To return to the Kelly case, it would appear that if the same principles were applied, Alder Hey hospital could be construed as being the legal owner of the body parts because of the \"skilled\" work they carried out.</p> <p>At the same time, they would appear to be answerable the same questions as Kelly. Did they take the body parts? Did they intend to deprive the \"owners\" of the property permanently? Were they acting dishonestly? It could well be that they are open to police investigation in the same way that Kelly was.</p> <p>Kelly's case has left a legal precedent which, in apparently seeking to protect the medical profession, may well have left it open to criminal investigation</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Wildgoose is a visiting lecturer at Winchester School of Art.

Dr Ruth Richardson, who has contributed to the Alder Hey inquiry, medical historian and author of Death, Dissection and the Destitute (a comprehensive study of the background and consequences of the 1832 Anatomy Act), submitted evidence to the recent chief medical officer's summit on organs and consent. In the new edition of her book, she discusses the \"fearful symmetry\" of commercial and social conditions prevailing in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (which led to sale of stolen corpses to anatomy schools for dissection) and conditions surrounding organ transplant and the research industry today. Unless the government acts to ensure that human material will never be bought and sold, we face a return to the kind of conditions which led to the 1832 Act where unregulated trade in human corpses put the public at risk. As Dr Richardson points out, the human corpse again has a commercial value unprecedented since the 1832 Act. Dr Richardson advises that we learn the lessons of medical history, and ensure that the human body is never bought or sold, but rather used in fully understood, consenting donation. However, this question remains: does current law sufficiently cover the question of ownership of the body under contemporary conditions for consent to be effectively protected? To return to the Kelly case, it would appear that if the same principles were applied, Alder Hey hospital could be construed as being the legal owner of the body parts because of the \"skilled\" work they carried out. At the same time, they would appear to be answerable the same questions as Kelly. Did they take the body parts? Did they intend to deprive the \"owners\" of the property permanently? Were they acting dishonestly? It could well be that they are open to police investigation in the same way that Kelly was. Kelly's case has left a legal precedent which, in apparently seeking to protect the medical profession, may well have left it open to criminal investigation \u0095 Jane Wildgoose is a visiting lecturer at Winchester School of Art.

      "body": "<p>It could, perhaps, happen to many or any of us: a misunderstanding at the Safeway checkout; the discovery of your stash of dope; a punch-up at closing time; a moment of insanity while driving . . . If the worst comes to the worst, and you are jailed in Bedfordshire or Cambridgeshire, you end up right here: being led in handcuffs up a flight of echoing stone steps by a Group Four employee, to be greeted by a gruff, burly figure like senior officer Rick Barnsdale, of the reception department of Her Majesty's Prison, Bedford. </p> <p>There is a brisk exchange of information while he fills in the first of the countless official forms. You hand over your property to be bagged and tagged: some of it will come back within the hour; some won't. Banned are alcohol-based toiletries (which might get drunk); wind-up radios (bomb-making potential); protein powders (mixable with drugs); bracelets (possible knuckledusters); football shirts (which might provoke a fight); and bananas (the mind boggles, but apparently you can smoke the skins). </p> <p>Then you get photographed and strip-searched, without ever being entirely naked: if you have heroin or (they swear it has happened) a knife hidden up your rectum, they won't find it unless it falls out when they tell you to squat. You are examined by a nurse and a doctor. If you are on remand, you can have your clothes back, the football shirt excepted. If you are convicted, you get the prison uniform: blue-striped shirt, grey sweatshirt, maroon jumper and jeans - perhaps not dissimilar to the clothes you were wearing in the first place. Then, past one further instruction - TUCK YOUR SHIRT IN - you are led to a cell. It is like checking in to a very, very bad hotel. </p> <p>If Mr Barnsdale and his colleagues seem edgy, it is partly because they have no idea what to expect. Some prisoners arrive fighting mad; others are tearful. Most, however, are compliant - they do know what to expect. There is a theory that prisons ought to make the reception procedure twice as nasty, then open the door and boot first-timers out on the street. That way they might never come back. Bedford has more regulars than the best hotels. </p> <p>There is no such thing as a typical British jail. They all have their foibles, and connoisseurs - both volunteers and conscripts - can discuss the differences with relish. But Bedford will do as an example. It is small: 400 inmates (all male) and 150 officers. It is a local prison: Category B, which means all but the worst villains start here, though most will be transferred onwards. </p> <p>It provides an authentic prison experience, too. The new jails often feel like comprehensive schools with very high windows. This one was opened in 1801 (the bicentenary ball is in August - residents not invited) by the penal reformer John Howard. It was state-of-the-art then; it certainly isn't now. The 12 by 9ft double cells date back to the 1840s, changed only for the addition of electricity and a not-very-private en suite toilet and basin, when slopping out was abolished a few years back. If it is ever closed down, Bedford could be used as a film set - from the 20ft outside wall to the Alcatraz-style exercise yard. The \"topping-shed\" where James Hanratty was hanged 40 years ago has been demolished, and the death cell is now a canteen. Almost everything else has been preserved, if not lovingly. </p> <p>But this jail may last another 100 years, even though it's on prime land in the town centre. A trust owns the site, so it cannot be sold off. And, though once it was considered to be the most overcrowded jail in western Europe, Bedford is now well regarded. The chief inspector, Sir David Ramsbotham, was complimentary when he came to visit in 1998. The Board of Visitors, who inspect regularly, feel the same: \"This is a very well run jail,\" says Peter Baldwin, its chairman. </p> <p>Bedford's glory, if that is the word, is its staff-prisoner relations. Like most greenhorns, I stepped over the threshold imagining that being buggered or bashed would be an absolute certainty. After a few days talking to dozens of people - jailers and jailed - this seemed far less likely. Indeed, I came to feel, like Jonathan Aitken, that prison could hold few terrors for anyone who endured a British public school in the 50s or 60s. At least fagging and beatings are officially barred. </p> <p>Most of the screws I met were - in theory, anyway - thoughtful and caring. They didn't tuck the prisoners up and kiss them goodnight, but they were not heavy-handed. There are a surprising number of women officers, many of them pretty: \"a humanising influence\" is the consensus. The food (three choices at supper plus vegetarian option; ethnic night every Wednesday) seemed better than in the average school or hospital. And for smokers - which here means almost everyone - prison is about the most liberal place left in Britain: far more tolerant than the Guardian office. </p> <p>It helps that there is a high turnover of inmates in Bedford: potential barons have less chance to get established, and officialdom has more of a chance to maintain the upper hand. The endless battle to keep out drugs is a stand-off, with the advantage - at least on cannabis - perhaps just shifting towards authority, thanks to mandatory testing. We hear about prisons when good order breaks down but, mostly, order does not break down. A prison runs properly only with the inmates' consent. \"On a Saturday afternoon there will be 95 prisoners at exercise and only four prison officers,\" says Peter Clarke, the deputy governor. \"If they didn't want to go back, we couldn't make them\". </p> <p>\"Of all the TV programmes I've ever seen on prisons,\" says Mr Barnsdale, \"there's only one that's ever been remotely true to life.\" He pauses for effect. \"Porridge. The public perception is one of violence. But it's mostly a good-humoured place to work.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, this is a place containing hundreds of frustrated individuals, jammed together and moaning constantly. And that's just the warders. They have a vital, responsible and - humour or not - sometimes dangerous job. They are paid badly and public sympathy is zero. \"It's the same every Christmas,\" says one officer. \"They'll say on TV about all the poor policemen and nurses who have to work. No one ever mentions us\". Prison officers are said to have the highest sickness rate in the country, and Bedford is not immune. </p> <p>Indeed, the good humour has been in short supply lately. A new, young governor, Andrew Cross, arrived in October and uncovered a financial crisis he is fighting to put right. \"When we compete with the private sector,\" Mr Cross says to me at one point, \"we give a high level of service delivery for minimum cost.\" He might have been in charge of the borough refuse collection. As one of his aides puts it: \"Management, efficiency and budgets figure far more in the equation now than prisoners. They're treated as a compliant commodity.\" </p> <p>So far, Bedford has not had to compete with the private sector. Hence the crisis, in the Mr Cross view. \"I actually embrace the opportunity to deliver better value for money for the taxpayers,\" he says. \"I have no qualms about that. If you look where staff are deployed, we can offer big savings. We all know there is going to be a fire in a street in the course of a year, but you can't have a fire engine on every street corner the whole year round. This job is all about risk assessment.\" </p> <p>His staff say they have been enduring cutbacks for years, and that the risks are too great. \"Our primary role is to keep prisoners here,\" says one officer. \"And a lot of time is spent standing round watching them watching us watching them. If that means standing round in a big circle holding hands, so be it. You've got the threat of physical violence 24-7.\" </p> <p>At least the prisoners get fed. The staff mess has been closed as a loss-maker, so officers have to cross the furiously busy A428 (Bedford's equivalent of the shark-infested waters round Devil's Island) to get lunch. Some go and have a few pints, which angers the governor. </p> <p>However, the prisoners are no more content. \"I'm not boasting,\" says one of the kitchen workers, \"but I've been in seven different jails. This one's shit. It's pure bang-up.\" Translation: Bedford prisoners spend a lot of time in their cells. </p> <p>This is partly true. The transit-camp aspect of the place means not everyone has a job, and the unemployed get locked up a lot. The authorities insist that everyone can find something to do. Some of the stuff is actually imaginative. Even the prisoners praise the Enhanced Thinking Skills course, in which they are forced to consider the consequences of each action. And there is a charity workshop that produces chess pieces (exquisite) and wedges, which Bedfordshire Crime Prevention give old ladies to stop their doors being forced open (exquisitely ironic). </p> <p>But it takes time to find a niche in jail. For the newcomer (after that mishap at Safeway or whatever), it is those first few hours that are so terrifying, as you come to terms with the uncertainties of prison - and the certainties. Lock-up is at eight. For the next 11 and a half hours there is no way out of the cell. The blocks slowly get quieter: the radios and (for the privileged) the TVs get turned down; the jangle of keys gets more infrequent. Then, perhaps, true desperation sets in. </p> <p>Come the dawn, things get better. There is an induction course where an officer like Bill McCready - small, stocky, northern, ex-RAF - takes the previous day's intake through the rules. There is an accompanying booklet, which is fine for the literate. So there is also an airline-style video, in which a soothing female voice talks about the \"well stocked canteen\" as if advertising the in-flight duty frees. Mr McCready himself is not soothing - \"If you expect everything to be done at once, you've come too far over the bridge. It's the Moat House you were looking for\" - but not unkind. The probation officer - who will at least call you Mr - the doctor, the chaplain and the education officer, may be truly kind. Then you can make a telephone call. And Day Two will pass, slowly. From what I saw, no single minute need be obscenely awful in Bedford. It's the hours, days, weeks, months and years. </p> <p>Does any of this work? Of course not. The most regular visitor I met was a poor inadequate on his 21st sentence. His only hope would be a place in some kind of halfway house. No one can find him one: he knows he'll be back. So will many, maybe most, of the others. About 70% of their crimes are in some way drug-related. Until that is addressed, there is little hope. </p> <p>Yet there was one promising sign. It struck me when I watched C Wing queue up for supper (shepherd's pie; chicken and mushroom pie; vegetable hotpot or rather manky kipper fillets). Most of the inmates would not have looked that out of place queuing at the refectory of an Oxford college. There was hardly anyone over 30. </p> <p>Some - the serious drinkers and druggies - never make 30. But most, it seems, actually do get smarter. \"It's the wives and girlfriends who do it,\" one officer theorised. \"They get fed up and start issuing ultimatums.\" And that seems to work far better than all the Home Office penal policies put together. </p> <p>Harshness for its own sake is out of fashion under Labour. But liberalism is hardly the watchword either. \"We have to treat prisoners well, and we do at Bedford,\" says Cross. \"That's our saving grace. But it's not enough. We have to treat them well, and do it cheaply.\"</p>",

Indeed, I came to feel, like Jonathan Aitken, that prison could hold few terrors for anyone who endured a British public school in the 50s or 60s. At least fagging and beatings are officially barred. Most of the screws I met were - in theory, anyway - thoughtful and caring. They didn't tuck the prisoners up and kiss them goodnight, but they were not heavy-handed. There are a surprising number of women officers, many of them pretty: \"a humanising influence\" is the consensus. The food (three choices at supper plus vegetarian option; ethnic night every Wednesday) seemed better than in the average school or hospital. And for smokers - which here means almost everyone - prison is about the most liberal place left in Britain: far more tolerant than the Guardian office. It helps that there is a high turnover of inmates in Bedford: potential barons have less chance to get established, and officialdom has more of a chance to maintain the upper hand. The endless battle to keep out drugs is a stand-off, with the advantage - at least on cannabis - perhaps just shifting towards authority, thanks to mandatory testing. We hear about prisons when good order breaks down but, mostly, order does not break down. A prison runs properly only with the inmates' consent. \"On a Saturday afternoon there will be 95 prisoners at exercise and only four prison officers,\" says Peter Clarke, the deputy governor. \"If they didn't want to go back, we couldn't make them\". \"Of all the TV programmes I've ever seen on prisons,\" says Mr Barnsdale, \"there's only one that's ever been remotely true to life.\" He pauses for effect. \"Porridge. The public perception is one of violence. But it's mostly a good-humoured place to work.\" Nonetheless, this is a place containing hundreds of frustrated individuals, jammed together and moaning constantly. And that's just the warders. They have a vital, responsible and - humour or not - sometimes dangerous job. They are paid badly and public sympathy is zero. \"It's the same every Christmas,\" says one officer. \"They'll say on TV about all the poor policemen and nurses who have to work. No one ever mentions us\". Prison officers are said to have the highest sickness rate in the country, and Bedford is not immune. Indeed, the good humour has been in short supply lately. A new, young governor, Andrew Cross, arrived in October and uncovered a financial crisis he is fighting to put right. \"When we compete with the private sector,\" Mr Cross says to me at one point, \"we give a high level of service delivery for minimum cost.\" He might have been in charge of the borough refuse collection. As one of his aides puts it: \"Management, efficiency and budgets figure far more in the equation now than prisoners. They're treated as a compliant commodity.\" So far, Bedford has not had to compete with the private sector. Hence the crisis, in the Mr Cross view. \"I actually embrace the opportunity to deliver better value for money for the taxpayers,\" he says. \"I have no qualms about that. If you look where staff are deployed, we can offer big savings. We all know there is going to be a fire in a street in the course of a year, but you can't have a fire engine on every street corner the whole year round. This job is all about risk assessment.\" His staff say they have been enduring cutbacks for years, and that the risks are too great. \"Our primary role is to keep prisoners here,\" says one officer. \"And a lot of time is spent standing round watching them watching us watching them. If that means standing round in a big circle holding hands, so be it. You've got the threat of physical violence 24-7.\" At least the prisoners get fed. The staff mess has been closed as a loss-maker, so officers have to cross the furiously busy A428 (Bedford's equivalent of the shark-infested waters round Devil's Island) to get lunch. Some go and have a few pints, which angers the governor. However, the prisoners are no more content. \"I'm not boasting,\" says one of the kitchen workers, \"but I've been in seven different jails. This one's shit. It's pure bang-up.\" Translation: Bedford prisoners spend a lot of time in their cells. This is partly true. The transit-camp aspect of the place means not everyone has a job, and the unemployed get locked up a lot. The authorities insist that everyone can find something to do. Some of the stuff is actually imaginative. Even the prisoners praise the Enhanced Thinking Skills course, in which they are forced to consider the consequences of each action. And there is a charity workshop that produces chess pieces (exquisite) and wedges, which Bedfordshire Crime Prevention give old ladies to stop their doors being forced open (exquisitely ironic). But it takes time to find a niche in jail. For the newcomer (after that mishap at Safeway or whatever), it is those first few hours that are so terrifying, as you come to terms with the uncertainties of prison - and the certainties. Lock-up is at eight. For the next 11 and a half hours there is no way out of the cell. The blocks slowly get quieter: the radios and (for the privileged) the TVs get turned down; the jangle of keys gets more infrequent. Then, perhaps, true desperation sets in. Come the dawn, things get better. There is an induction course where an officer like Bill McCready - small, stocky, northern, ex-RAF - takes the previous day's intake through the rules. There is an accompanying booklet, which is fine for the literate. So there is also an airline-style video, in which a soothing female voice talks about the \"well stocked canteen\" as if advertising the in-flight duty frees. Mr McCready himself is not soothing - \"If you expect everything to be done at once, you've come too far over the bridge. It's the Moat House you were looking for\" - but not unkind. The probation officer - who will at least call you Mr - the doctor, the chaplain and the education officer, may be truly kind. Then you can make a telephone call. And Day Two will pass, slowly. From what I saw, no single minute need be obscenely awful in Bedford. It's the hours, days, weeks, months and years. Does any of this work? Of course not. The most regular visitor I met was a poor inadequate on his 21st sentence. His only hope would be a place in some kind of halfway house. No one can find him one: he knows he'll be back. So will many, maybe most, of the others. About 70% of their crimes are in some way drug-related. Until that is addressed, there is little hope. Yet there was one promising sign. It struck me when I watched C Wing queue up for supper (shepherd's pie; chicken and mushroom pie; vegetable hotpot or rather manky kipper fillets). Most of the inmates would not have looked that out of place queuing at the refectory of an Oxford college. There was hardly anyone over 30. Some - the serious drinkers and druggies - never make 30. But most, it seems, actually do get smarter. \"It's the wives and girlfriends who do it,\" one officer theorised. \"They get fed up and start issuing ultimatums.\" And that seems to work far better than all the Home Office penal policies put together. Harshness for its own sake is out of fashion under Labour. But liberalism is hardly the watchword either. \"We have to treat prisoners well, and we do at Bedford,\" says Cross. \"That's our saving grace. But it's not enough. We have to treat them well, and do it cheaply.\"",

While the Dutch pathologist Dick van Velzen will bear much of the blame for the wholesale removal of organs during postmortem examinations at the hospital and their subsequent storage, several doctors received letters from the Department of Health yesterday, warning them that they too would be named even though they have not been given a chance to read the sections of the report that refer to them. The report is so graphic and outspoken that ministers took the decision to make it public behind a cloak of parliamentary privilege, which affords them protection against libel. The usual practice is to release the report at a press conference. This secrecy has already upset the parents whose children underwent autopsy at Alder Hey, who have also been refused the opportunity to read the report in advance. There are fears that the macabre practices described in the report may lead to a public disturbance at the hospital. Leaders of the medical profession fear the revelations may further damage the standing of doctors, even though it is likely that blame will largely be laid at the door of Professor Van Velzen, who has already been characterised as a \"rogue pathologist\". In a speech to the King's Fund yesterday, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, said that the trust between doctor and patient was essential. \"The days have gone where the NHS could act as a secret society. It cannot operate behind closed doors. It cannot keep patients in the dark. It has to take patients into its confidence. It has to actively earn the trust of patients in life and it has to actively seek the consent of relatives in death.\" Prof Van Velzen has gone to ground. Canadian authorities have applied for his extradition over a stash of children's organs discovered in a warehouse in Nova Scotia, where Prof Van Velzen worked after leaving Liverpool in 1995. He has been charged with \"improperly offering indignity to human remains\", which carries a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. Yesterday his lawyers appealed to the Nova Scotia supreme court, arguing that the case should be thrown out on the grounds that the police and the Crown violated Prof Van Velzen's constitutional rights by turning down several chances to talk to him. Dr James Wright, a pathologist at IWK Grace hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Prof Van Velzen worked until 1998, has been ordered to produce documents relating to organs discovered in the storage unit. The remains did not belong to British children. Yesterday, the Westeinde hospital in the Hague, where Prof Van Velzen was working when the extradition request was made, would only say that he is \"not employed here at the moment\". He is believed to have been given unpaid leave while he contests the allegations. He maintains he has done nothing wrong, claiming that the organs were collected with research programmes in mind, although today's report will reveal that very little research was ever done. Yesterday, Mr Milburn said he wanted changes in the law to ensure relatives were fully informed of what doctors intended to do at autopsy when they gave consent. They will be asked to sign a very detailed consent form, which specifies not only that they allow organs to be taken for research but also which organs. If there is insufficient time to make the change in the law before the election, it is understood that Mr Milburn will press for it to be included in the party manifesto. Questions are also likely to be asked about the role of the General Medical Council, which regulates doctors. However, the GMC is likely to point out that the responsibility for any failure to alert the public or the authorities to what was happening in the name of medical science at Alder Hey belongs to the doctors and managers there. The GMC has begun an investigation into Prof Van Velzen but said it could not act against him until it saw the inquiry report.

      "trailText": "<p>Ten years after Lord Woolf's landmark report on the state of our jails, the Guardian's prison columnist,  Erwin James, reflects on the lessons of 16 years under lock and key</p>",
      "byline": "Erwin James",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I can still vividly remember his dark, pinstripe suit, so skilfully tailored that it retained its immaculate shape even when he sat down, and his lightly tanned, manicured hands emerging from stiff white cuffs. It was the summer of 1990 and Lord Justice Woolf, as he was then, had come to visit the high-security Midlands prison where I was being held as part of his inquiry into the Strangeways riot and other prison disturbances. </p> <p>At that time the prison was well known in the system for holding mainly \"hardcore\" offenders. Long sentences and cramped accommodation made for a tense atmosphere. Wing life could be precarious, with a stabbing or a scalding almost every other day. \"Paranoia City\", the inmates called it. Lord Woolf had already spoken to the governors and the prison officers, and now he wanted to talk to the prisoners. </p> <p>There were about 30 of us present that morning, serving sentences ranging from five to 35 years. We sat on soft-backed chairs, set in three semi-circle rows in the prison chapel. After some polite small talk, Woolf explained why he was there: \"We need to try and find out what it is actually like to be in prison.\" Until that moment, this was not something I had spent much time thinking about. What was it like to be in prison? Didn't he know? Of course he didn't - how could he? But for the first time since beginning my sentence six years earlier, I contemplated the fact that the people responsible for sending us to prison had no idea what it was like. Perhaps that was the problem. </p> <p>Around me, men I had never before heard discussing their feelings about prison were doing their best to fill in the blanks. It was \"educational\", one said. \"In what way?\" the judge wanted to know. \"Well, you learn to understand yourself better,\" came the reply. \"You spend so much time in your head\". Others talked about the loneliness, the fear, the paranoia. </p> <p>I sat there and drifted back to my first day as a prisoner. I'm walking along a gantry-style landing on the long-term wing of a large London prison. I'm on the third floor - \"the threes\". I'm carrying a plastic bucket inside which clatters a plastic cup, knife, fork and spoon. Under my arm I have a \"bedroll\": two flannel sheets rolled up inside two coarse blankets. </p> <p>I'm guided to my cell by a large prison officer sporting a handlebar moustache. The peak of his cap has been \"slashed\" so it fits low over the bridge of his nose. We reach the cell and with a noisy rattle of his keys he unlocks the door and pushes it open. He's smiling \"In you go son, don't be shy\". The door slams shut behind me. </p> <p>The cell is dimly lit by a small, grime-covered fluorescent light. The walls are covered in cracked and flaking emulsion. There's a table, a chair, and a metal bed, with a stained mattress and half a foam pillow. The heavily barred window high up on the wall is closed, and the urine-tainted air makes me want to retch. </p> <p>I sit down on the bed. Time to collect my thoughts - but no, I hear a sound like rolling thunder approaching fast, and suddenly the cell door is unlocked and pushed open again. \"Slop out and get your tea,\" instructs handlebars. </p> <p>A stream of denim-clad men in identical blue-and-white-striped shirts are shuffling past my door. I step out and join the flux. Down two flights of metal stairs to the ground floor; we're headed towards a set of trestle tables. A row of prisoners in white are serving food. Before I get there I am stopped in my tracks by a scream: \"He's fuckin' dead meat!\" \"Nonce! He's fuckin' dead meat!\" I turn and see two men: one wields a mop handle, the other a metal bucket. They are using the domestic implements to beat a third prisoner who cowers in a cell doorway. \"He's fuckin' dead meat!\" </p> <p>Suddenly I'm aware that no one else is stopping. Nobody is intervening. Few even look in the direction of the violence. I fall back in line, pick up a tray, collect my meal and return to my cell. As I sit on the chair and spoon down the food, all thoughts and feelings about why I am in prison are relegated. My first priority, I now understand, is to learn to survive. </p> <p>Back in the chapel, a prisoner was telling the judge that life inside was \"a war of survival\". I recognised the angry voice instantly: it was John, who lives on my spur. The same John who a few months earlier had led an attempt to burn a number of sex offenders. John's accomplice had been transferred out of the prison following the riot but he had remained, his status with other prisoners enhanced. I half wished that somebody would explain this to the judge, and say: \"Your honour, that's what prison is like.\" </p> <p>The judge's visit set me thinking. Prison was no doubt necessary. But it was unsettling that prison life was such a mystery to society. There seemed an assumption among many on the outside that people in prison were inherently different. Prisoners were not individuals, but a collective, with the same crude standards, values, and culture - a sub-race, almost. </p> <p>It made me think about some of the people I had met inside. There was Dave, who on the out had been a postman; Howard, who had been a student; and Tam who had been a council worker. The four of us played pool at the weekend. Tam was the captain of the wing football team, nicknamed \"the Commander\" for his prowess in midfield. Dave had asthma so he'd taken up jogging. He'd lost two stone, bolstered his health and begun doing sponsored runs around the football pitch for charity. Howard spent his days in the education department studying and dreaming of becoming a teacher. </p> <p>Three and a half years later, my next movement order came through. By then Tam had been transferred to Scotland. Dave was in a semi-open prison, let out regularly to take part in charity road runs. And Howard was dead - diabetes-induced coma. One night in bed he went to sleep with his face in the pillow and never woke up. </p> <p>Prison life is mostly a continuous repetition of the same day, over and over again. Finding a purpose and a meaning beyond \"punishment\" can be a struggle. Often people are not in prison long enough to discover anything worthwhile beyond a new set of criminal alliances. Or people end up inside for so long that any good that might have been achieved along the way is undermined by bitterness and resentment. </p> <p>The paradox of imprisonment lies in society's expectations: the community wants retribution, but also rehabilitation. For many, sending people to prison is not enough; they must suffer while there. But only somebody who has never been to prison would believe that jails are \"soft\" places. </p> <p>I remember the campaign a few years ago calling for prisons to be made more \"austere\". But the truth that the austerity brigade failed to grasp is that the harsher a prisoner feels himself to have been treated, the less of an obligation he will feel to abide by society's rules, and the more likely new victims will be created after release. Official figures speak for themselves - more than half of prisoners reoffend within two years of release. </p> <p>I have seen it with my own eyes: a young man serving four years, and not prepared to kowtow to what he sees as the intransigence of the prison regime. Why can't he go out on the exercise yard when it's raining? Why has his mother not been allowed to visit him just because she brought the wrong visiting order by mistake? He gets known as a \"troublemaker\", goes \"on report\", and loses his \"time off for good behaviour\". Less than two years after he is freed, he is back, serving a minimum 25-year sentence. Any connection? </p> <p>A fair answer to Lord Woolf's question would not be entirely bleak. Opportunities for personal advancement abound in prison. I have never been in a jail which did not have an education department, library, gymnasium, chapel, psychologists, probation officers and counsellors. I have been a beneficiary of all the above. When I sat on that bed in that London prison 17 years ago, I never dreamed how my life would be transformed. I could barely string two sentences together; now I sit here with an embarrassment of qualifications, which include Braille transcription, sports leadership, a clutch of O levels and an arts degree. </p> <p>There are many fine people who work in prisons. I recall the cookery teacher who made sure everyone in her class got to make a Christmas cake to send home to their families, even when they couldn't afford the ingredients. The teacher who taught his play-reading group to love Shakespeare. The young prison officer who treated prisoners with such respect that, when he died suddenly, dozens in their best striped shirts lined the route from the gate to the prison to bow their heads to his hearse. And the governor who had the courage to tell a man convicted of brutal crimes that, in his view, considering the man's background, he was as much a victim as his victims. But the fact remains that I've never been in a jail where making prisoners feel good about themselves was a priority. </p> <p>Many prisoners were sceptical about private prisons at first. The morality of making profit from imprisonment seemed questionable at best. But the message began to spread that they were preferable to state-run prisons. A conversation with a prison auxiliary helped me understand why. He had transferred prisoners to a private prison. \"You should see the difference,\" he said. \"As soon as the cons get out of the van, they're greeted with a 'Good morning, Mr Smith, would you like to come this way?' They're reminded that they're people first and prisoners second. Their whole demeanour changes. They're polite in return to the staff, and each other!\" I had to admit I had never been to a prison like that. </p> <p>Prison is designed to disempower. Everyone in jail is vulnerable to a greater or lesser extent. Prisoners live at the mercy of those who are in charge, and of each other, and dignity is a scarce commodity. If the regime is accompanied by an attitude that undermines a prisoner's confidence and self-esteem, then all the stated good intentions will be worth nothing. It is when prisoners feel that they are not being afforded respect as people that the cynical prison culture - the culture of John and the nonce beaters - thrives. </p> <p>During the course of his inquiry, Lord Woolf visited 43 prisoners. When his 600-page report was published, optimism surged through the system. That was until it was all but mothballed by the \"prison works\" philosophy of the mid-90s. More people in prison, the theory went, meant less criminals on the streets, so less crimes being committed. </p> <p>Before this idea took off, the chaplain in a jail I was in told me: \"Mark my words, in future imprisonment will be about warehousing.\" I witnessed what he meant. Within two years the jail doubled its population, but had its education budget slashed. Staff and prisoner morale collapsed. Similar changes occurred all over the country. Since then prison numbers have soared, as have suicides, and the best those who serve society can come up with is more of the same. </p> <p>Prison can work, but not if the system is overloaded and under-resourced. And if it is to work in society's best interest, it is imperative that only those that really need to be locked up, are, and that all prisons work towards a positive regime where respect and dignity for inmates is not compromised for misguided reasons. </p> <p>A few weeks ago, Lord Woolf urged politicians to stop \"playing the jail card\". Those who do play a dangerous game of bluff, and there can be no winners in the long run - only more victims. </p> <p>\u0095 Erwin James is serving a life sentence. He writes fortnightly in G2.

I recall the cookery teacher who made sure everyone in her class got to make a Christmas cake to send home to their families, even when they couldn't afford the ingredients. The teacher who taught his play-reading group to love Shakespeare. The young prison officer who treated prisoners with such respect that, when he died suddenly, dozens in their best striped shirts lined the route from the gate to the prison to bow their heads to his hearse. And the governor who had the courage to tell a man convicted of brutal crimes that, in his view, considering the man's background, he was as much a victim as his victims. But the fact remains that I've never been in a jail where making prisoners feel good about themselves was a priority. Many prisoners were sceptical about private prisons at first. The morality of making profit from imprisonment seemed questionable at best. But the message began to spread that they were preferable to state-run prisons. A conversation with a prison auxiliary helped me understand why. He had transferred prisoners to a private prison. \"You should see the difference,\" he said. \"As soon as the cons get out of the van, they're greeted with a 'Good morning, Mr Smith, would you like to come this way?' They're reminded that they're people first and prisoners second. Their whole demeanour changes. They're polite in return to the staff, and each other!\" I had to admit I had never been to a prison like that. Prison is designed to disempower. Everyone in jail is vulnerable to a greater or lesser extent. Prisoners live at the mercy of those who are in charge, and of each other, and dignity is a scarce commodity. If the regime is accompanied by an attitude that undermines a prisoner's confidence and self-esteem, then all the stated good intentions will be worth nothing. It is when prisoners feel that they are not being afforded respect as people that the cynical prison culture - the culture of John and the nonce beaters - thrives. During the course of his inquiry, Lord Woolf visited 43 prisoners. When his 600-page report was published, optimism surged through the system. That was until it was all but mothballed by the \"prison works\" philosophy of the mid-90s. More people in prison, the theory went, meant less criminals on the streets, so less crimes being committed. Before this idea took off, the chaplain in a jail I was in told me: \"Mark my words, in future imprisonment will be about warehousing.\" I witnessed what he meant. Within two years the jail doubled its population, but had its education budget slashed. Staff and prisoner morale collapsed. Similar changes occurred all over the country. Since then prison numbers have soared, as have suicides, and the best those who serve society can come up with is more of the same. Prison can work, but not if the system is overloaded and under-resourced. And if it is to work in society's best interest, it is imperative that only those that really need to be locked up, are, and that all prisons work towards a positive regime where respect and dignity for inmates is not compromised for misguided reasons. A few weeks ago, Lord Woolf urged politicians to stop \"playing the jail card\". Those who do play a dangerous game of bluff, and there can be no winners in the long run - only more victims. \u0095 Erwin James is serving a life sentence. He writes fortnightly in G2.

      "body": "<p>They call them \"girls\". \"And in Holloway they called you lassies,\" groans Sam. \"I turned round and said: 'I'm not an old dog.'\" Kathrine giggles. \"I got called Fanny the other day - my mum used to call me that when I was younger.\" \"There's one officer on this wing, because my surname is Knight, keeps calling me Gladys,\" Sam bats back, rolling her eyes and pressing a hand to her forehead. \"If we said that to him, we'd get on report.\" </p> <p>There are things about a prison: the smell of sour milk and detergent, the ugly-making brightness of the lights, every moment punctuated by signings, lockings, unlockings. And there are particular things about a women's prison. Aggression is subdued to bitching and pettiness and cuts on people's arms. Social exclusion is not just about the colour of your skin or the emptiness of your purse, but about who is looking after your baby. And they call them \"girls\". \"I feel like a little kid again. You have to jump when they say jump, you have to bite your tongue when you get angry,\" says Sam Knight, who is 20. She is handsome, funny and articulate, and serving a four-year sentence in Bulwood Hall, near Southend - one of Britain's 16 women's prisons - for importing cocaine. It was her first offence. </p> <p>\"It gets me angry being in here. They're wasting my time. I know I've done a crime and I wouldn't do it again. But I'm working my butt off in here, my daughter's out there, and I could be with her. I don't know why I did it. But someone's waving a wad of money in your face and you know someone who's done it before, no probs. No one got hurt. Four years for a first offence . . . \" She trails off. </p> <p>The female population is the fastest-growing section of the prison estate. It has more than doubled in six years, rising to 3,392 in 1999. It is an extraordinary increase, particularly when the facts about women and prison are considered. </p> <p>We know that the majority of women offenders pose a low risk to the public. We know that imprisoning mothers has a disproportionately disruptive effect on family life. We know that because the number of women in prison is relatively small, inmates are held far from home and their access to suitable regimes is restricted. We know that women react more adversely to custody than men, not least because of the higher incidence of mental-health problems among female prisoners. We know that more than half the women in prison have experienced physical or sexual abuse. So why are we locking up more of the most vulnerable people in the country? </p> <p>It is difficult to tease out the reasons. Despite the recent moral panic about girl gangs, the rise in violent offences is negligible. Most women in prison are not that dangerous - the most common crimes are theft or handling stolen goods, together with fraud and forgery, although the number of women sentenced for drug offences has risen dramatically. This increase is largely the result of the courts' new emphasis on deterrence, but another factor, according to Pat Carlen, professor of sociology at Bath University, is the number of women in poverty. \"Women have totally different experiences of crime: they don't mix with criminals, don't think of themselves as criminals and their criminal careers are shorter and less violent. It's personal circumstances that get women into prison.\" </p> <p>Ms Carlen argues that women are doubly punished for offending against stereotypical ideas of how \"nice\" girls behave. Twice as many women as men are imprisoned for a first offence. Such as Knight. Her three-year-old daughter is living with her father. She is one of the third of mothers in prison with a child under the age of five. It is much easier if you have support from a family, she explains. \"I've got my baby's father, my mum, my dad, my brothers and sisters. I've got a lot, but it's still hard because I keep feeling like I've got to rely on them. I'm asking for things from them, but they didn't put me here.\" </p> <p>There could never be a television series called Blokes of a Feather, says Chris Tchaikovsky of the pressure group Women in Prison. \"More than 80% of women stand by their men when they are inside, compared with just 17% of men. Many don't have families to help them either because they come from state care. So there's a huge qualitative difference on a day-to-day level, in terms of getting letters, pictures and money. </p> <p>\"But the greatest pain is separation from children, and the ongoing concerns about housing and resettlement that stem from that. For men, losing your home doesn't necessarily mean losing your kids.\" </p> <p>Women also feel a loss of function in prison, says Ms Carlen, as the rules and regulations cut across their domestic domain. They find it much harder to be regimented, particularly around household issues such as eating, while the lack of hygiene and privacy affects them much more. </p> <p>\"I haven't sat on a toilet seat for 19 months,\" laughs Knight. \"I can't even use the toilet paper in there, I have to bring my own from my room. It's the little things you miss, like eating with a knife and fork - we have to eat with plastic.\" </p> <p>The quality of the food concerns her. \"The chicken is all watery, it's not cooked. The rice tastes tough and it's not washed properly. At lunchtime I try and eat a little of the chips and sausage, but apart from that I buy my tuna and crackers and do my thing in my room.\" </p> <p>Some of your pride disappears in prison, she says. \"Like with strip searches, even when you're on your period . You just feel like you've got no self-respect. Because it's other women doing it to you. To have to strip when they say strip, for them to come and search your room and pull up your bed.\" </p> <p>\"It's so degrading,\" adds Astrid Vildgaard. \"When you get strip-searched, all that day and the day after is ruined because you go so low. They do it every month.\" </p> <p>Vildgaard, 19, is also serving a sentence for drug importation. From Denmark, she is one of the foreign nationals who make up 15% of our female prison population. Nearly three-quarters of foreigners are convicted of drug offences and serving significantly longer sentences than their British counterparts. \"When I got arrested, I couldn't speak the language,\" says Vildgaard. She is now fluent, especially in expletives. </p> <p>There are two key questions, says Chris Wilkinson of the Scarman Centre at Leicester University. \"Why do certain groups of women - foreign nationals, first-time offenders, women with mental health problems - find themselves in prison? We need to focus on the factors that lead them there and then look at the alternatives offered by the probation service. Second, what are their needs once in prison, and are those needs the same as men's? Women in prison are disadvantaged, damaged and dependent. Many self-harm. All too often prison serves to exacerbate the problems that have led women to offend in the first place.\" </p> <p>The staff of Bulwood Hall certainly appear to be trying to meet those needs, with a healthcare centre, an education block, a gym and a wing where vulnerable prisoners - first-timers who are finding it difficult to cope, self-harmers, the elderly - have more intensive care. There is a hairdressing salon where women can study for a National Vocational Qualification and a fashion studio where they learn dressmaking and put on a fashion show each year. A variety of drug treatment and counselling programmes are available, as well as the enhanced thinking skills course, a national programme that deals with \"cognitive deficits\". </p> <p>Ms Wilkinson is sceptical about such courses. \"They individualise and pathologise women, and allow for no recognition of the structural problems of society that force them to live in awful poverty and in abusive situations. It's all about managing your anger, and not about having \u00a32 in your pocket to feed your kids.\" </p> <p>Kathrine Samuel says it is boring at Bulwood Hall. She is not \"enhanced\" - she has not yet been granted privileges - so has no television in her room. Mostly, she sleeps. </p> <p>Samuel is 16 and serving six months for street robbery. She and her friends ran off with a girl's bag, she tells me, and when the police came looking for them she got caught. It was her first offence. She will be out in March. Her baby is due in May. </p> <p>She is a tiny thing, with a sparkling stud in her lip. She has the softest voice. I don't doubt that she has the capacity to be a right cow. But she wants to buy things for the baby and can't. </p> <p>Last February, the Prison Reform Trust published its report, Justice for Women. The result of an extensive independent inquiry into the state of women's prisons and their inmates, it concluded that there was \"an overwhelming case\" for the reduction in the use of imprisonment for women offenders: \"They are women who the system has failed time and time again. These women are socially excluded. Imprisonment will only isolate them further.\" </p> <p>Women like Samuel, and children like her unborn child. \"I had my own flat,\" she says. \"But they took it off me. I don't know where I'll stay when I get out. I suppose I might go to a mother and baby unit.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>The medical profession is bracing itself for a wave of revulsion and distrust from the public today when a horrifying report into the storage of children's organs at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool is revealed. </p> <p>While the Dutch pathologist Dick van Velzen will bear much of the blame for the wholesale removal of organs during postmortem examinations at the hospital and their subsequent storage, several doctors received letters from the Department of Health yesterday, warning them that they too would be named even though they have not been given a chance to read the sections of the report that refer to them. </p> <p>The report is so graphic and outspoken that ministers took the decision to make it public behind a cloak of parliamentary privilege, which affords them protection against libel. The usual practice is to release the report at a press conference. </p> <p>This secrecy has already upset the parents whose children underwent autopsy at Alder Hey, who have also been refused the opportunity to read the report in advance. There are fears that the macabre practices described in the report may lead to a public disturbance at the hospital. </p> <p>Leaders of the medical profession fear the revelations may further damage the standing of doctors, even though it is likely that blame will largely be laid at the door of Professor Van Velzen, who has already been characterised as a \"rogue pathologist\". </p> <p>In a speech to the King's Fund yesterday, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, said that the trust between doctor and patient was essential. </p> <p>\"The days have gone where the NHS could act as a secret society. It cannot operate behind closed doors. It cannot keep patients in the dark. It has to take patients into its confidence. It has to actively earn the trust of patients in life and it has to actively seek the consent of relatives in death.\" </p> <p>Prof Van Velzen has gone to ground.

      "bodyText": "The medical profession is bracing itself for a wave of revulsion and distrust from the public today when a horrifying report into the storage of children's organs at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool is revealed. While the Dutch pathologist Dick van Velzen will bear much of the blame for the wholesale removal of organs during postmortem examinations at the hospital and their subsequent storage, several doctors received letters from the Department of Health yesterday, warning them that they too would be named even though they have not been given a chance to read the sections of the report that refer to them. The report is so graphic and outspoken that ministers took the decision to make it public behind a cloak of parliamentary privilege, which affords them protection against libel. The usual practice is to release the report at a press conference. This secrecy has already upset the parents whose children underwent autopsy at Alder Hey, who have also been refused the opportunity to read the report in advance. There are fears that the macabre practices described in the report may lead to a public disturbance at the hospital. Leaders of the medical profession fear the revelations may further damage the standing of doctors, even though it is likely that blame will largely be laid at the door of Professor Van Velzen, who has already been characterised as a \"rogue pathologist\". In a speech to the King's Fund yesterday, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, said that the trust between doctor and patient was essential. \"The days have gone where the NHS could act as a secret society. It cannot operate behind closed doors. It cannot keep patients in the dark. It has to take patients into its confidence. It has to actively earn the trust of patients in life and it has to actively seek the consent of relatives in death.\" Prof Van Velzen has gone to ground. Canadian authorities have applied for his extradition over a stash of children's organs discovered in a warehouse in Nova Scotia, where Prof Van Velzen worked after leaving Liverpool in 1995. He has been charged with \"improperly offering indignity to human remains\", which carries a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. Yesterday his lawyers appealed to the Nova Scotia supreme court, arguing that the case should be thrown out on the grounds that the police and the Crown violated Prof Van Velzen's constitutional rights by turning down several chances to talk to him. Dr James Wright, a pathologist at IWK Grace hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Prof Van Velzen worked until 1998, has been ordered to produce documents relating to organs discovered in the storage unit. The remains did not belong to British children. Yesterday, the Westeinde hospital in the Hague, where Prof Van Velzen was working when the extradition request was made, would only say that he is \"not employed here at the moment\". He is believed to have been given unpaid leave while he contests the allegations. He maintains he has done nothing wrong, claiming that the organs were collected with research programmes in mind, although today's report will reveal that very little research was ever done. Yesterday, Mr Milburn said he wanted changes in the law to ensure relatives were fully informed of what doctors intended to do at autopsy when they gave consent. They will be asked to sign a very detailed consent form, which specifies not only that they allow organs to be taken for research but also which organs. If there is insufficient time to make the change in the law before the election, it is understood that Mr Milburn will press for it to be included in the party manifesto. Questions are also likely to be asked about the role of the General Medical Council, which regulates doctors. However, the GMC is likely to point out that the responsibility for any failure to alert the public or the authorities to what was happening in the name of medical science at Alder Hey belongs to the doctors and managers there. The GMC has begun an investigation into Prof Van Velzen but said it could not act against him until it saw the inquiry report.",

      "body": "<p>A British rescue team today pulled a man alive from under the rubble of his home in Bhuj, five days after western India was struck by an earthquake that has left up to 100,000 dead. </p> <p>His survival has forced rescuers to revise plans to scale down their search for anyone left alive. Before the rescue of the latest trapped survivor, the British team had been planning to leave tomorrow. </p> <p>\"We postponed the pullout for 24 hours. We cannot pull out having found an alive one today,\" said James Brown of the department for international development, which has sponsored the British rescue team. </p> <p>\"He was speaking. He had his own water while he was in there,\" said Indian soldier K.S. Seehan, who witnessed the rescue. Some 20,000 soldiers have been joined by local and foreign volunteers in the rescue effort. </p> <p>Mike Thomas, head of the British team, said that Indian authorities had told him the priority now was shelter for survivors of the quake, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale. \"If after five days you survive, it's due to exceptional luck, a cavity large enough and access to water,\" he said.</p> <p>Elsewhere, bereaved families stunned by the enormity of Friday's disaster which killed at least 20,000 people and possibly many times that, alternated between grief and anger at the slowness of efforts to find their loved ones. A lack of heavy earthmoving equipment has hindered efforts to clear the debris.</p> <p>Those able to take possession of bodies retrieved from the debris hastily cremated them in makeshift roadside ceremonies. Officials said that despite the omnipresent smell from decomposing corpses trapped beneath the debris in towns and villages across the western state of Gujarat, the area worst hit by the quake, there had been no report of disease breaking out.</p> <p>Today the road to Bhuj was packed with water trucks and lorries transporting wood for funeral pyres. Survivors have been living out in the open since the quake struck. They are being fed at community kitchens.</p> <p>But fear of fresh tremors and the prospect of a fifth night in the open triggered a mini-exodus of thousands of better-off residents of Ahmedabad, the main city in Gujarat. \"People are leaving in all directions. Some are going to Bombay and others are leaving for Delhi and Rajasthan,\" said an official at Ahmedabad rail station, where travellers jostled for space as they waited for the next train out. </p> <p>Mild tremors shook parts of Gujarat late on Monday. More than 200 aftershocks have been felt since the quake hit. </p> <p>Defence minister George Fernandes said the death toll from the quake that flattened several villages and toppled countless buildings across the rich agricultural and industrial state could be as high as 100,000. \"If my worst fears come true the death toll could be in six figures,\" he said after touring ravaged areas.</p> <p>Officials said it was certain the toll would rise. \"Nobody disputes the 20,000 figure. It's bound to go up,\" said H.K. Dua, information adviser to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. </p> <p> <strong>How you can help</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.redcrossdonations.org.uk\">Red Cross appeal</a> or call 08705 125125 <br><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/atwork/emerg/indiaearthquake.htm\">Oxfam</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/pressrels/270101.html\">Save the Children</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/giving/donate/donform.asp?app=\" india\"\">Unicef</a><br><a href=\"http://www.interaction.org/india00/index.html\">US organisations involved in the relief effort</a> </p> <p> <strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,431207,00.html\">31.01.2001: Tales of hope in Indian town that turned to dust</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430742,00.html\">30.01.2001: After the devastation, the miracle of a baby saved from a concrete tomb</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430744,00.html\">30.01.2001: Tragedy of UK doctor who died</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430307,00.html\">29.01.2001: Hopes fade as toll rises to 20,000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430302,00.html\">29.01.2001: 'In half a minute everyone was killed'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430308,00.html\">29.01.200, comment: Lessons from past disasters go unheeded</a> </p> <p> <strong>Photo gallery</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,429420,00.html\">The disaster in pictures</a> </p> <p> <strong>Interactives guides and graphics</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/flash/0,7365,430599,00.html\">Interactive guide to the Indian earthquake</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,428815,00.html\">Map of the disaster zone</a> </p> <p> <strong>Audio</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0129harding.ra\">29.01.2001: Indian quake leaves devastation 'on an epic scale'</a><br>The relief effort has come too late for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake, reports <strong> Luke Harding </strong> in Ahmedabad.

      "bodyText": "A British rescue team today pulled a man alive from under the rubble of his home in Bhuj, five days after western India was struck by an earthquake that has left up to 100,000 dead. His survival has forced rescuers to revise plans to scale down their search for anyone left alive. Before the rescue of the latest trapped survivor, the British team had been planning to leave tomorrow. \"We postponed the pullout for 24 hours. We cannot pull out having found an alive one today,\" said James Brown of the department for international development, which has sponsored the British rescue team. \"He was speaking. He had his own water while he was in there,\" said Indian soldier K.S. Seehan, who witnessed the rescue. Some 20,000 soldiers have been joined by local and foreign volunteers in the rescue effort. Mike Thomas, head of the British team, said that Indian authorities had told him the priority now was shelter for survivors of the quake, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale. \"If after five days you survive, it's due to exceptional luck, a cavity large enough and access to water,\" he said. Elsewhere, bereaved families stunned by the enormity of Friday's disaster which killed at least 20,000 people and possibly many times that, alternated between grief and anger at the slowness of efforts to find their loved ones. A lack of heavy earthmoving equipment has hindered efforts to clear the debris. Those able to take possession of bodies retrieved from the debris hastily cremated them in makeshift roadside ceremonies. Officials said that despite the omnipresent smell from decomposing corpses trapped beneath the debris in towns and villages across the western state of Gujarat, the area worst hit by the quake, there had been no report of disease breaking out. Today the road to Bhuj was packed with water trucks and lorries transporting wood for funeral pyres. Survivors have been living out in the open since the quake struck. They are being fed at community kitchens. But fear of fresh tremors and the prospect of a fifth night in the open triggered a mini-exodus of thousands of better-off residents of Ahmedabad, the main city in Gujarat. \"People are leaving in all directions. Some are going to Bombay and others are leaving for Delhi and Rajasthan,\" said an official at Ahmedabad rail station, where travellers jostled for space as they waited for the next train out. Mild tremors shook parts of Gujarat late on Monday. More than 200 aftershocks have been felt since the quake hit. Defence minister George Fernandes said the death toll from the quake that flattened several villages and toppled countless buildings across the rich agricultural and industrial state could be as high as 100,000. \"If my worst fears come true the death toll could be in six figures,\" he said after touring ravaged areas. Officials said it was certain the toll would rise. \"Nobody disputes the 20,000 figure. It's bound to go up,\" said H.K. Dua, information adviser to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.

They have been on trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law for the last eight months.</p> <p>There are three possible verdicts the judges could deliver tomorrow: guilty, innocent or not proven - the latter specific to Scottish law. Any verdict other than guilty will result in the immediate release of the two men.</p> <p>If convicted, the men face life imprisonment in a Glasgow jail. The defence would have two weeks to appeal a guilty verdict. Any appeal would be heard by a five-judge Scottish court at Camp Zeist. The prosecution cannot appeal.</p> <p>Both men have pleaded innocent, with the defence suggesting Palestinian extremists carried out the bombing, probably on behalf of Iran in revenge for the shooting down of an Iranian civilian Airbus earlier in 1988 by the US missile cruiser USS Vincennes.</p> <p>Prosecution lawyers say the accused sent an unaccompanied suitcase containing a bomb on board an Air Malta flight from Luqa airport in Malta, which was later transferred to the doomed Pan Am flight.</p> <p>Mr Megrahi and Mr Fhimah surrendered for trial in April 1999 under a deal settled with the Libyan leader Muammar Gadafy, who agreed to have them stand trial in a neutral country after nearly a decade of economic sanctions.</p> <p><b>Interactive</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,237847,00.html\">Our guide to the Lockerbie disaster</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0110seenan.ra\">10.01.2001: Gerry Seenan in Camp Zeist on the Lockerbie trial's endgame.

      "bodyText": "A verdict in the Lockerbie bombing trial will be delivered tomorrow, the presiding Scottish high court judge, Lord Ranald Sutherland, announced today. The decision will be issued at 10am GMT at Camp Zeist, a former US air base, where the judges have heard the case against two Libyans charged with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The two men, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, are accused of planting a bomb on the flight and which killed 270 people in December 1988. They have been on trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law for the last eight months. There are three possible verdicts the judges could deliver tomorrow: guilty, innocent or not proven - the latter specific to Scottish law. Any verdict other than guilty will result in the immediate release of the two men. If convicted, the men face life imprisonment in a Glasgow jail. The defence would have two weeks to appeal a guilty verdict. Any appeal would be heard by a five-judge Scottish court at Camp Zeist. The prosecution cannot appeal. Both men have pleaded innocent, with the defence suggesting Palestinian extremists carried out the bombing, probably on behalf of Iran in revenge for the shooting down of an Iranian civilian Airbus earlier in 1988 by the US missile cruiser USS Vincennes. Prosecution lawyers say the accused sent an unaccompanied suitcase containing a bomb on board an Air Malta flight from Luqa airport in Malta, which was later transferred to the doomed Pan Am flight. Mr Megrahi and Mr Fhimah surrendered for trial in April 1999 under a deal settled with the Libyan leader Muammar Gadafy, who agreed to have them stand trial in a neutral country after nearly a decade of economic sanctions.

      "bodyText": "Cable operator Telewest is staging a comeback after a disastrous summer last year, when it lost ground to its digital rivals. The Microsoft-backed company said it was on course to reach 500,000 subscribers by March after announcing its latest operating figures. Telewest's shares were hammered last year when supply problems caused a shortage of digital set-top boxes and let rivals ONdigital and BSkyB race ahead. Telewest said it had signed up 377,664 digital customers at the end of December. It was \"confident\" of reaching the 500,000 mark by the end of the first quarter of the year. \"These figures show Telewest is delivering on target,\" said chief executive Adam Singer. \"Our focus on customer service and the launch of our digital pricing and packaging is starting to reap benefits.\" Telewest is on many analysts' long-term buy lists because of the potential revenue to be gained from bundled services. These combine television, internet and telephone, accessed through a single cable line. The company's shares rose 2% (or 3p) to 148.75p in early trading, although they are still far behind their 12-month high of 563p. But Telewest and close rival NTL remain far behind BSkyB, which has over 4m digital customers, and Ondigital, which has just over 1m. It is expected Telewest and NTL, the two major UK cable companies, will merge at some point in the future in order to catch up with their competitors. In the short term, it is likely the two parties will collaborate to cut costs. This could involve joint purchasing of set-top boxes and a combined approach on regulatory issues. NTL has set itself a target of 1.25m digital subscribers by the end of the year.",

      "body": "<p>Lisa Peel was supposed to be smacked up, but she has been clean for a while - been through the \"rattle\". There can't be many worse places to go through the rattle than a housing estate outside Middlesbrough. High-gloss pink kitchen walls; cold turkey in the afternoon in the corner of the sitting room where Lovejoy leaps about the screen with Joanna Lumley.</p> <p>Outside, the atmosphere on the estate is heavy with heroin. It's in the agitated gait of the young men hurrying by as if they are going to miss the last train to somewhere important. It's in the rigid, heads-down march of two women across the road hoping that if they push their prams fast enough their kids won't be infected.</p> <p>Peel's life of addiction, abuse and confusion may have nothing to do with her mother's life spent in and out of prison. She certainly doesn't blame her mother, although she does wish she had been around more. \"The first time my mum went into prison I was two and a half. I remember going to see her with my dad. He told me that she was in hospital but I kept asking where the bed was. Then, after the visit, she went back through a door to the cells and they said 'kids aren't allowed in there'.\"</p> <p>This year, around 44,000 children will lose their mother, or father, to Her Majesty's prisons. Peel's mother, Julie Miller, has already served six sentences for everything from driving while banned to cheque-book fraud, and is halfway through a seventh. \"I committed child abuse by leaving her,\" she says.</p> <p>Peel is softer on her mother. \"She was a heroin addict and she had mental health problems. She needed help, my mum.\"</p> <p>Diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic in 1991, Miller, now 37, was a regular at St Luke's psychiatric hospital in Middlesbrough. The day before her last crime, she arrived at St Luke's in an agitated state and was sent home with 60 sleeping tablets. Once home, she added diazepam (tranquillisers) and crack cocaine to the mix and went out to rob the local Spar with a kitchen knife. Her sister was behind the till; she held the knife to her throat. She got four and a half years.</p> <p>She began her sentence on her daughter's 18th birthday. That was the night Peel started on the path to heroin addiction. \"I'd tried it three times before, but that night I just wanted to get wasted. I'm not blaming my mum - I might have ending up doing it anyway. But that's when it really started.</p> <p>\"I was on my own in the house with \u00a342 a week. Social services didn't know anything about me. The night the police arrested my mother they boarded up the doors. I said to them: 'Hey, I live here,' and they said: 'We'll give you some time to get your stuff out.' After that I always [saw] people around who were taking it. I could do what I liked, she was locked up.\"</p> <p>Peel remembers the second time her mother went to jail. She was six or seven years old. \"They told me she was 'working away'. She got 22 months for driving while banned. I had to stay with her girlfriend. I think she was jealous of the love my mum had for me and she hit me. I didn't tell my mum she was beating me then because Heather said she'd kill me if I told and I believed her.</p> <p>\"She went into prison for the fifth time when I was 16. She was really sick then. She was on heroin and crack. When she went inside that time, I just stayed in the house.</p> <p>\"I dropped out of college. I would probably have stayed on if she was around. But word got out that my ma was inside. People started saying she was a smackhead and I was living in a smack house. So I stayed at home. I really missed her then. We were close, me and my ma: there was only 17 years between us. We used to go to the pub together.\"</p> <p>Miller is serving out her sentence in one of the country's more progressive prisons, Low Newton, near Durham, where the drug-rehabilitation programme is the only one of its kind in Britain. It is 2.45pm; visiting time. Inside the main gates a drug-sniffing spaniel is circling the 20 or so children who have been brought in to see their mothers. For the most part it seems to be the grandmothers and sisters, not the men, who have brought the kids.</p> <p>The women and children sit around white Formica tables in the prison's old dining room. The walls are painted yel low, and there is a play area for children.</p> <p>Tracy Lally, 32, has five children. She has been a heroin addict since she was 16 and hasn't seen her kids for over a year. \"Two of my kids are up for adoption and I'm happy about that. Their foster mother is great. It's my eight-year-old, Kyle, I worry about. He was four and a half when I was taken from him and he said: 'Ma, why don't you just climb over the fence? They can't keep you in here, they are not your ma and da.' \"</p> <p>Low Newton's governor, Mike Kirby, surveys the scene. He has worked in some of the country's harshest prisons. One of his worst memories was of a scene in the visiting room at Warrington in Cheshire. \"The father came in with the son. I think he was about five and he didn't understand that his mother was in a prison and she wasn't leaving with them. At the end of visiting time he grabbed her waist and wouldn't let her go. He started screaming that he didn't want to leave her. It was tragic, really tragic. It upset everyone.\"</p> <p>Diana Rogan, 32, is with her two chil dren, aged 11 and 13. A former heroin addict serving five years for supplying heroin, she is due to be released at the end of 2002. Her son says: \"The other kids used to come up and say, 'Your ma is in prison,' but now they've stopped. Sometimes I had to shout at them. I like coming to see my ma and I never cry because it upsets my ma.\"</p> <p>For some children, keeping their parent's imprisonment hidden is a burden. Jill remembers taking her son to Durham prison to see his father for the first time. \"I didn't know the way, so I asked someone in the street and my son, Owen, said to me after: 'Ma, why did you have to go and do that? Now everyone will know my da is in prison.'\"</p> <p>Owen often tried to make excuses not to go and see his father. Durham, a high-security prison, can be a traumatic place for children. \"They get stressed out. They think their dad is working there and ask me: 'Do you work here with my dad, do you drive the big white van [the prison transfer van] like my dad?' \" says Christine Slassor of the North-East Prison After-Care Society (Nepac). \"When they go in they are searched - shoes, coats, everything. They take off their watches and belts and go through a scanner. Then they have to stand in line while sniffer dogs search them for drugs.\"</p> <p>The biggest problem for most kids is understanding where and why their mother has gone. \"When I was about seven and she went back in,\" says Peel, \"I couldn't understand why she had just gone and left me.\"</p> <p>Joshua was eight when his mother was sent to Low Newton. \"She said she was going to her friend's. She called a taxi, and the taxi just came and drove her here.\"</p> <p>Joanne Moss is also on the drug rehabilitation programme at the prison. \"My son, who's four, took it very bad. He started taking his shoes off and hiding them to get attention. Or taking off his clothes. I went on home leave and he never left my side; he was holding on to me all the time. When he comes to see me there are tantrums and I wonder sometimes if it would be better for him not to come, but I'm desperate to see him. It's hard.\"</p> <p>In October, Britain's prison service will offer an alternative to prison for some addicts - compulsory treatment in the community. The drugs testing and treatment order is, says the Howard League for Penal Reform, \"a big step in the right direction\".</p> <p>Twenty years ago, such a programme might have given Lisa Peel back her mother. \"I did nothing wrong. I know she had to suffer for what she did, but the kids shouldn't have to suffer as well. I have never been in trouble with the police - never had a caution, never. I don't care what anybody says, you need your mum.\"</p> <p>Help for children of imprisoned parents is available from the Federation of Prisoners and Family Support Groups on 020-8741 4578.

      "body": "<b> Duncan Williams, 36 </b> <br> Time served: six months on remand Crime: arson and criminal damage (acquitted) <p> On arriving at HMP Wandsworth the first thing that strikes you is the dark and doom- ridden architecture. Then comes the oversized, tattered clothing. That gives the prison officers in the \"reception area\" a reason to yell at you to: \"Tuck your fucking shirt in, fella, you look like a sack of fucking horse shit!\" </p> <p>The constant bullying from officers creates contempt, defiance and hatred. It is wrong to suggest that every prison officer is an uncaring, unintelligent sadist; there are many men and women working hard to do a difficult job as best they can. But thanks to underfunding, overcrowding, understaffing, poor training and old-school attitudes, there are far too few of them. By the time the majority of men are ready for release from Wandsworth they are - if they weren't before - bitter, hate-ridden individuals with little in the way of a future. Many are back within months of release. </p> <p>While I was there, most of us were not engaged in any constructive activity during the day. We spent 23 hours out of 24 hours locked in a tiny 8x12ft cell, two sharing. It was mind-numbing. </p> <p>I made at least three applications for educational courses within the first few days of arriving and never heard a reply. The nearest I came to education was when a group of 20 or more inmates were herded into a small holding room and issued with scraps of paper that we were told were an \"educational standard\" test. The pages had been photocopied so many times that the typeface was barely readable. Most people didn't care. They were grateful to get out of the cell for a few minutes. </p> <p>I used to read letters out to one man who was illiterate. He never got any assistance to learn to read and write throughout his stay. He was only in for three months for some drunken crime, but surely some better use could have been made of his time there? </p> <p>Drugs and addiction are the evil behind most crimes and the abuse does not stop inside. Heroin has replaced cannabis as the drug of choice because it stays in the system for less time, so it's harder to trace. Despite claims to the contrary, Wandsworth is awash with drugs.

      "bodyText": "Duncan Williams, 36 Time served: six months on remand Crime: arson and criminal damage (acquitted) On arriving at HMP Wandsworth the first thing that strikes you is the dark and doom- ridden architecture. Then comes the oversized, tattered clothing. That gives the prison officers in the \"reception area\" a reason to yell at you to: \"Tuck your fucking shirt in, fella, you look like a sack of fucking horse shit!\" The constant bullying from officers creates contempt, defiance and hatred. It is wrong to suggest that every prison officer is an uncaring, unintelligent sadist; there are many men and women working hard to do a difficult job as best they can. But thanks to underfunding, overcrowding, understaffing, poor training and old-school attitudes, there are far too few of them. By the time the majority of men are ready for release from Wandsworth they are - if they weren't before - bitter, hate-ridden individuals with little in the way of a future. Many are back within months of release. While I was there, most of us were not engaged in any constructive activity during the day. We spent 23 hours out of 24 hours locked in a tiny 8x12ft cell, two sharing. It was mind-numbing. I made at least three applications for educational courses within the first few days of arriving and never heard a reply. The nearest I came to education was when a group of 20 or more inmates were herded into a small holding room and issued with scraps of paper that we were told were an \"educational standard\" test. The pages had been photocopied so many times that the typeface was barely readable. Most people didn't care. They were grateful to get out of the cell for a few minutes. I used to read letters out to one man who was illiterate. He never got any assistance to learn to read and write throughout his stay. He was only in for three months for some drunken crime, but surely some better use could have been made of his time there? Drugs and addiction are the evil behind most crimes and the abuse does not stop inside. Heroin has replaced cannabis as the drug of choice because it stays in the system for less time, so it's harder to trace. Despite claims to the contrary, Wandsworth is awash with drugs. I remember sitting in a cell with one poor soul who had attempted to smuggle a large quantity of narcotics into the prison by secreting a stash up his backside; unfortunately, the condom he had packed the stash into burst. He fell into a deep coma and had to be rushed to hospital. Suicide is also rife in prison. Six men were found dead in Wandsworth by midsummer of 2000. In July, I was moved into a cell where a Spanish inmate had attempted suicide the night before. The cellmate told me the man had been beaten by someone and was in a state of total fear. He woke to find the man choking on a noose tied to a metal hinge. He pulled the man down in the nick of time and he was rushed to hospital. In this instance the police were called, but no charges were brought and no statements made. I left Wandsworth in December with nothing but a plastic sack, uncomfortable memories and the clothes on my back. I'd lost my flat, my job and my self-respect. Sharon Corzon, 26 Sentence: five years Crime: GBH This was my first sentence and I got the maximum you could get for GBH because I'm black and the girl I attacked was white. That's what I think. The three prisons I've been in have all been prejudiced against black people. White girls can be so rude to the officers - they can swear at them, they can be really insulting and give the officer no respect, and they can get away with it.

      "body": "<p>No one seems to know the whole of Harry's story, but this is what they do know. He was born in Kilmarnock, worked on the railways, became an alcoholic after his parents died. They know he lived rough and that in 1991 he was sentenced to life for starting a series of fires. He is 71.</p> <p>It was never easy to get through to Harry at the best of times, and a couple of years ago it began to get even harder. Depending on who you ask, he was suffering from either Alzheimer's or a form of alcohol-induced dementia. Everyone agrees that he frequently did not know where he was, that he began falling over regularly and became incontinent. Once he borrowed a lighter to light a cigarette and accidentally set his hair on fire. They put him in a cell with a CCTV camera because they were so worried he would do himself an injury.</p> <p>Recently, when he could no longer walk without help, he was moved to a nearby prison hospital. Doctors there said he should be released, but to where? \"It's difficult to find nursing homes that are prepared to take people like that,\" says Stuart McLean, who retired as governor of Portsmouth's Kingston prison last week. \"The last thing they want is to have someone who may be disruptive.\"</p> <p>Harry's case highlights one of the thorniest questions facing our penal system: when, if ever, is someone too old or infirm to be kept behind bars? It is a delicate balancing act between compassion and risk, and right now the scales are tipped heavily against compassion. \"If someone has a terminal illness I will pull out all the stops to give them the dignity of dying a free man,\" says McLean. \"But apart from that there's not a lot I can do. It's difficult to get people released because everyone wants to make sure there's not going to be some sort of miraculous recovery. That can be terribly embarrassing.\"</p> <p>McLean has more experience of these grim calculations than most. Kingston is the only prison in the country with a wing dedicated to elderly prisoners. The administrative wing of the Victorian jail was converted into accommodation for around 30 older prisoners five years ago in response to the rising number of elderly inmates in the system. The numbers of old prisoners has mirrored the explosion in the prison population of the last 15 years. In 1989 there were just 345 prisoners over the age of 60; by 1999 there were 1,053. There are 250 inmates in their 70s and 21 over 80. Until now, however, the prison service has devoted little or no thought to how to handle older inmates. Individual jails do the best they can, usually housing their older inmates in so-called VP (vulnerable prisoner) wings or prison hospitals. \"[The prison service] has no policy on the elderly at all,\" Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, says in an interview with the Guardian to be published on Friday. \"When I discover an 87-year-old on a Zimmer frame with Alzheimer's in a high-security prison, I'm sorry, but I think that is a nonsense.\"</p> <p>Built in 1877 as Portsmouth's town jail, Kingston prison is a generously proportioned, three-storey stone structure surrounded by 20-foot walls topped with a roll of barbed wire. It is renowned for its gardens - complete with aviaries, manicured hedges, water features and artificial bowling green - and its football team. (The team's position at the top of the local league could have something to do with the fact that all fixtures are played at home and visiting supporters are forbidden, admits McLean.) It is also the only prison in Britain that takes only lifers, meaning that at least three-quarters of its inmates are murderers.</p> <p>The idea behind H wing was to give older lifers some protection from the rest of the population, says McLean. Its inmates can circulate in the prison but other prisoners cannot pass through the two heavy gates that separate it from the rest of the jail. The wing itself has many of the trappings of a care home: stairlifts, specially equipped baths and alarm buttons in each room. Its rooms, each shared by four inmates, are bright and comparatively airy and there are several spartan communal rooms that could easily be mistaken for doctors' waiting rooms. Staff appear to be patient and courteous. \"The biggest problem with them is motivation,\" says Jim Clark, one of the officers on the wing. \"We've tried to get them out to play bowls but they just won't go. About a third of them work and the rest of them don't want to move away from their TVs.\"</p> <p>Sir David Ramsbotham has praised Kingston for its treatment of elderly prisoners, so why, I wonder, has the press been kept out until now? A prison service official offers a surprisingly candid response: \"A lot of people in the service have doubts about whether these people should still be in prison.\"</p> <p>It's easy to see why. In one room I meet Boom Boom, a man who looks to be in his 70s leaning awkwardly on a three-legged walking stick. Like many of the inmates on E wing, he is dressed in tracksuit bottoms, T-shirt and slippers. I ask him how old he is and he holds up one hand to show five fingers, while making a series of incomprehensible sounds.</p> <p>\"You're 60, aren't you, Boom Boom?!\" bellows his room-mate, Frank. Frank explains that Boom Boom suffered a stroke before being admitted to prison: \"He can't do much. When he arrived at the Scrubs all he could say was 'boom boom'. That's how he got his name.\" The large, high-ceilinged room is divided into four by a series of drab partitions. The floor is dirty and the cream walls are bare. A TV is flickering noiselessly in the corner and a few books are scattered on the floor. It looks just like the kind of care home you hope you'll never end up in.</p> <p>McLean is quick to point out that Boom Boom and Frank are among the scruffiest inmates on the wing. \"They were living rough before they came in,\" he says. \"No one else will share with them.\"</p> <p>Upstairs the rooms are tidier and less gloomy. The furniture would not look out of place in a student accommodation block. In one room the walls are decorated with pieces of wrapping paper. In another there is an inmate who spends his time making replica Faberge eggs.</p> <p>A photo of Princess Diana has pride of place by Sam's bed. He is 50, 11 years into a life sentence for murder. He's one of the youngest prisoners on the wing, admitted because he suffered a stroke. He has barely seen the two grandchildren who were born since his conviction but he thinks his age has helped him to get through his sentence: \"If I was 21 or 22 at the time I wouldn't have been able to make it.\"</p> <p>The average age of prisoners on E wing is 65, but most look older than that. \"People age quicker in prison,\" says Gill Ripiner, the senior nurse who runs the prison dispensary. \"A 55-year-old inside would be more like a 65-year-old outside. The stress levels are high, they can't do things to relieve the stress and they can't do as much exercise.\"</p> <p>Although they are more likely to suffer medical problems, specialising in older inmates has its advantages, says McLean: \"The staff-to-prisoner ratio can be quite low because you're unlikely to have a serious problem [with violence]. The sort of problem I'm worried about is not an attack, it's that someone will light a cigarette and discard the match.\" Its not just a figure of speech. A senior officer later tells me that several cigarette burns were found on Harry's torso when he was transferred to hospital. \"He'd obviously just rolled over and lain on them. Fortunately all the mattresses are flame resistant.\"</p> <p>McLean says the prison has encountered two unforeseen problems. One has been the reluctance of many older prisoners to go anywhere near E wing. \"It's perceived as dead men's shoes. People think the only way out is by dying.\" In fact, he says, more prisoners have been released to lower-security establishments than have died.</p> <p><b> T</b> he second problem is that many of the inmates are in a poorer condition than the unit had bargained for. \"Unfortunately, fit elderly people do become progressively more frail and the problem we've got now is that we've got people who really we shouldn't be keeping any longer who need to move from residential care into a nursing home, and we are not a nursing home.\"</p> <p>Albert, a neatly dressed 69-year-old who has served 18 years of a life sentence for murdering his wife, describes the condition of some of the E wing prisoners in more graphic terms. \"Christ, we all get old, but you've got blokes pissing in the plant pots and blokes shitting themselves.\" He says he was grateful for a move back to the main part of the prison after he underwent a hip replacement operation. \"I was in there with a chap who'd done 42 years and one night I wake up and he's pissing up against the wall. It could have been brilliant but you've got the wrong people in there. You have people who should be in a hospice.\"</p> <p>McLean acknowledges that there are at least two prisoners on the wing who have \"lost it\" and \"others who you talk to and you think: 'I'm not really getting through here.' \" But as another senior officer points out, senility or even extreme frailty are no guarantee that someone will not reoffend.</p> <p>Dick's case illustrates the dilemma facing the prison authorities. Dick is 57 and has served 16 years of a life sentence for rape. He is suffering from motor neurone disease and wears calipers. Doctors have called for his release, the senior officer tells me, \"which is all very well, but where are you going to put him? He's got to go to a care home but the fact of the matter is that these places often have a lot of young women working in them. Physically he couldn't rape anybody, but he could ravish someone - and can you risk letting that happen?\"</p> <p>With few signs of a more liberal approach to releasing elderly prisoners any time soon, the prison service is at last aknowleging that it will have to hold and care for older and sicker prisoners. It is spending \u00a33m on creating facilities for elderly inmates at several prisons. \"This is something that has crept up on us quite recently,\" said Martin Nary, director-general of the prison service. Kingston has submitted a proposal to upgrade the facilities and staffing of E wing so that it can offer equivalent care to a nursing home. Already, says, Alisdair Munroe, there's not much difference between E wing and many care homes on the outside \"except that it's all male and we don't let them out\".</p> <p>Frank, however, has little time for those who point out that life for him is not very different from what it would be like if he were in a home. \"They say you must like prison. Nobody likes prison. It's a stupid question, it's daft. The same people asking it don't go to the door and open it.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Names of prisoners have been changed.</p>",

Frank explains that Boom Boom suffered a stroke before being admitted to prison: \"He can't do much. When he arrived at the Scrubs all he could say was 'boom boom'. That's how he got his name.\" The large, high-ceilinged room is divided into four by a series of drab partitions. The floor is dirty and the cream walls are bare. A TV is flickering noiselessly in the corner and a few books are scattered on the floor. It looks just like the kind of care home you hope you'll never end up in. McLean is quick to point out that Boom Boom and Frank are among the scruffiest inmates on the wing. \"They were living rough before they came in,\" he says. \"No one else will share with them.\" Upstairs the rooms are tidier and less gloomy. The furniture would not look out of place in a student accommodation block. In one room the walls are decorated with pieces of wrapping paper. In another there is an inmate who spends his time making replica Faberge eggs. A photo of Princess Diana has pride of place by Sam's bed. He is 50, 11 years into a life sentence for murder. He's one of the youngest prisoners on the wing, admitted because he suffered a stroke. He has barely seen the two grandchildren who were born since his conviction but he thinks his age has helped him to get through his sentence: \"If I was 21 or 22 at the time I wouldn't have been able to make it.\" The average age of prisoners on E wing is 65, but most look older than that. \"People age quicker in prison,\" says Gill Ripiner, the senior nurse who runs the prison dispensary. \"A 55-year-old inside would be more like a 65-year-old outside. The stress levels are high, they can't do things to relieve the stress and they can't do as much exercise.\" Although they are more likely to suffer medical problems, specialising in older inmates has its advantages, says McLean: \"The staff-to-prisoner ratio can be quite low because you're unlikely to have a serious problem [with violence]. The sort of problem I'm worried about is not an attack, it's that someone will light a cigarette and discard the match.\" Its not just a figure of speech. A senior officer later tells me that several cigarette burns were found on Harry's torso when he was transferred to hospital. \"He'd obviously just rolled over and lain on them. Fortunately all the mattresses are flame resistant.\" McLean says the prison has encountered two unforeseen problems. One has been the reluctance of many older prisoners to go anywhere near E wing. \"It's perceived as dead men's shoes. People think the only way out is by dying.\" In fact, he says, more prisoners have been released to lower-security establishments than have died. T he second problem is that many of the inmates are in a poorer condition than the unit had bargained for. \"Unfortunately, fit elderly people do become progressively more frail and the problem we've got now is that we've got people who really we shouldn't be keeping any longer who need to move from residential care into a nursing home, and we are not a nursing home.\" Albert, a neatly dressed 69-year-old who has served 18 years of a life sentence for murdering his wife, describes the condition of some of the E wing prisoners in more graphic terms. \"Christ, we all get old, but you've got blokes pissing in the plant pots and blokes shitting themselves.\" He says he was grateful for a move back to the main part of the prison after he underwent a hip replacement operation. \"I was in there with a chap who'd done 42 years and one night I wake up and he's pissing up against the wall. It could have been brilliant but you've got the wrong people in there. You have people who should be in a hospice.\" McLean acknowledges that there are at least two prisoners on the wing who have \"lost it\" and \"others who you talk to and you think: 'I'm not really getting through here.' \" But as another senior officer points out, senility or even extreme frailty are no guarantee that someone will not reoffend. Dick's case illustrates the dilemma facing the prison authorities. Dick is 57 and has served 16 years of a life sentence for rape. He is suffering from motor neurone disease and wears calipers. Doctors have called for his release, the senior officer tells me, \"which is all very well, but where are you going to put him? He's got to go to a care home but the fact of the matter is that these places often have a lot of young women working in them. Physically he couldn't rape anybody, but he could ravish someone - and can you risk letting that happen?\" With few signs of a more liberal approach to releasing elderly prisoners any time soon, the prison service is at last aknowleging that it will have to hold and care for older and sicker prisoners. It is spending \u00a33m on creating facilities for elderly inmates at several prisons. \"This is something that has crept up on us quite recently,\" said Martin Nary, director-general of the prison service. Kingston has submitted a proposal to upgrade the facilities and staffing of E wing so that it can offer equivalent care to a nursing home. Already, says, Alisdair Munroe, there's not much difference between E wing and many care homes on the outside \"except that it's all male and we don't let them out\". Frank, however, has little time for those who point out that life for him is not very different from what it would be like if he were in a home. \"They say you must like prison. Nobody likes prison. It's a stupid question, it's daft. The same people asking it don't go to the door and open it.\" \u0095 Names of prisoners have been changed.",

      "body": "<p>They call them \"girls\". \"And in Holloway they called you lassies,\" groans Sam. \"I turned round and said: 'I'm not an old dog.'\" Kathrine giggles. \"I got called Fanny the other day - my mum used to call me that when I was younger.\" \"There's one officer on this wing, because my surname is Knight, keeps calling me Gladys,\" Sam bats back, rolling her eyes and pressing a hand to her forehead. \"If we said that to him, we'd get on report.\"</p> <p>There are things about a prison: the smell of sour milk and detergent, the ugly-making brightness of the lights, every moment punctuated by signings, lockings, unlockings. And there are particular things about a women's prison. Aggression is subdued to bitching and pettiness and cuts on people's arms. Social exclusion is not just about the colour of your skin or the emptiness of your purse, but about who is looking after your baby. And they call them \"girls\". \"I feel like a little kid again. You have to jump when they say jump, you have to bite your tongue when you get angry,\" says Sam Knight, who is 20. She is handsome, funny and articulate, and serving a four-year sentence in Bulwood Hall, near Southend - one of Britain's 16 women's prisons - for importing cocaine. It was her first offence.</p> <p>\"It gets me angry being in here. They're wasting my time. I know I've done a crime and I wouldn't do it again. But I'm working my butt off in here, my daughter's out there, and I could be with her. I don't know why I did it. But someone's waving a wad of money in your face and you know someone who's done it before, no probs. No one got hurt. Four years for a first offence . . . \" She trails off.</p> <p>The female population is the fastest- growing section of the prison estate. It has more than doubled in six years, rising to 3,392 in 1999. It is an extraordinary increase, particularly when the facts about women and prison are considered.</p> <p>We know that the majority of women offenders pose a low risk to the public. We know that imprisoning mothers has a disproportionately disruptive effect on family life. We know that because the number of women in prison is relatively small, inmates are held far from home and their access to suitable regimes is restricted. We know that women react more adversely to custody than men, not least because of the higher incidence of mental-health problems among female prisoners. We know that more than half the women in prison have experienced physical or sexual abuse. So why are we locking up more of the most vulnerable people in the country?</p> <p>It is difficult to tease out the reasons. Despite the recent moral panic about girl gangs, the rise in violent offences is negligible. Most women in prison are not that dangerous - the most common crimes are theft or handling stolen goods, together with fraud and forgery, although the number of women sentenced for drug offences has risen dramatically. This increase is largely the result of the courts' new emphasis on deterrence, but another factor, according to Pat Carlen, professor of sociology at Bath University, is the number of women in poverty. \"Women have totally different experiences of crime: they don't mix with criminals, don't think of themselves as criminals and their criminal careers are shorter and less violent. It's personal circumstances that get women into prison.\"</p> <p>Carlen argues that women are doubly punished for offending against stereotypical ideas of how \"nice\" girls behave. Twice as many women as men are imprisoned for a first offence. Such as Knight. Her three-year-old daughter is living with her father. She is one of the third of mothers in prison with a child under the age of five. It is much easier if you have support from a family, she explains. \"I've got my baby's father, my mum, my dad, my brothers and sisters. I've got a lot, but it's still hard because I keep feeling like I've got to rely on them. I'm asking for things from them, but they didn't put me here.\"</p> <p>There could never be a television series called Blokes of a Feather, says Chris Tchaikovsky of the pressure group Women in Prison. \"More than 80% of women stand by their men when they are inside, compared with just 17% of men. Many don't have families to help them either because they come from state care. So there's a huge qualitative difference on a day-to-day level, in terms of getting letters, pictures and money.</p> <p>\"But the greatest pain is separation from children, and the ongoing concerns about housing and resettlement that stem from that. For men, losing your home doesn't necessarily mean losing your kids.\"</p> <p>Women also feel a loss of function in prison, says Carlen, as the rules and regulations cut across their domestic domain. They find it much harder to be regimented, particularly around household issues such as eating, while the lack of hygiene and privacy affects them much more.</p> <p>\"I haven't sat on a toilet seat for 19 months,\" laughs Knight. \"I can't even use the toilet paper in there, I have to bring my own from my room. It's the little things you miss, like eating with a knife and fork - we have to eat with plastic.\"</p> <p>The quality of the food concerns her. \"The chicken is all watery, it's not cooked. The rice tastes tough and it's not washed properly. At lunchtime I try and eat a little of the chips and sausage, but apart from that I buy my tuna and crackers and do my thing in my room.\"</p> <p>Some of your pride disappears in prison, she says. \"Like with strip searches, even when you're on your period . You just feel like you've got no self-respect. Because it's other women doing it to you. To have to strip when they say strip, for them to come and search your room and pull up your bed.\"</p> <p>\"It's so degrading,\" adds Astrid Vildgaard. \"When you get strip-searched, all that day and the day after is ruined because you go so low. They do it every month.\"</p> <p>Vildgaard, 19, is also serving a sentence for drug importation. From Denmark, she is one of the foreign nationals who make up 15% of our female prison population. Nearly three-quarters of foreigners are convicted of drug offences and serving significantly longer sentences than their British counterparts. \"When I got arrested, I couldn't speak the language,\" says Vildgaard. She is now fluent, especially in expletives.</p> <p>There are two key questions, says Chris Wilkinson of the Scarman Centre at Leicester University. \"Why do certain groups of women - foreign nationals, first-time offenders, women with mental health problems - find themselves in prison? We need to focus on the factors that lead them there and then look at the alternatives offered by the probation service. Second, what are their needs once in prison, and are those needs the same as men's? Women in prison are disadvantaged, damaged and dependent. Many self-harm. All too often prison serves to exacerbate the problems that have led women to offend in the first place.\"</p> <p>The staff of Bulwood Hall certainly appear to be trying to meet those needs, with a healthcare centre, an education block, a gym and a wing where vulnerable prisoners - first-timers who are finding it difficult to cope, self-harmers, the elderly - have more intensive care. There is a hairdressing salon where women can study for a National Vocational Qualification and a fashion studio where they learn dressmaking and put on a fashion show each year. A variety of drug treatment and counselling programmes are available, as well as the enhanced thinking skills course, a national programme that deals with \"cognitive deficits\".</p> <p>Wilkinson is sceptical about such courses. \"They individualise and pathologise women, and allow for no recognition of the structural problems of society that force them to live in awful poverty and in abusive situations. It's all about managing your anger, and not about having \u00a32 in your pocket to feed your kids.\"</p> <p>Kathrine Samuel says it is boring at Bulwood Hall. She is not \"enhanced\" - she has not yet been granted privileges - so has no television in her room. Mostly, she sleeps.</p> <p>Samuel is 16 and serving six months for street robbery. She and her friends ran off with a girl's bag, she tells me, and when the police came looking for them she got caught. It was her first offence. She will be out in March. Her baby is due in May.</p> <p>She is a tiny thing, with a sparkling stud in her lip. She has the softest voice. I don't doubt that she has the capacity to be a right cow. But she wants to buy things for the baby and can't.</p> <p>Last February, the Prison Reform Trust published its report, Justice for Women. The result of an extensive independent inquiry into the state of women's prisons and their inmates, it concluded that there was \"an overwhelming case\" for the reduction in the use of imprisonment for women offenders: \"They are women who the system has failed time and time again. These women are socially excluded. Imprisonment will only isolate them further.\"</p> <p>Women like Samuel, and children like her unborn child. \"I had my own flat,\" she says. \"But they took it off me. I don't know where I'll stay when I get out. I suppose I might go to a mother and baby unit.\"</p>",

Thus confirmed it is selling its consumer interactive operation, following the lead of rivals such as Redstone Telecom and Atlantic Telecom, who have announced cutbacks in order to move into profit sooner. The company is also pulling out of installing broadband equipment in BT's phone exchanges, after having doubts over the financial benefits of so-called local loop unbundling. Mr Allan said the continuing focus on small businesses and the disposal of the interactive division will contribute to an even better second half of the year. \"The acceleration in sales growth achieved in the third quarter gave further confidence that the company will deliver enhanced revenues throughout the second half of the current financial year,\" added Mr Allan. Shares in Thus rose 17% to 72.5p, although the results fell slightly below analysts' estimates.

      "bodyText": "An advertising campaign for the charity Medecins sans Frontieres has been rejected by two glossy magazines because the content is \"too strong\". Trendy style magazine Wallpaper and high society glossy Harpers &amp; Queen have both refused to take the magazine inserts, which carry harrowing images of the charity's work in emergency medical aid. The stark black and white images include a photograph of a hand with two fingers missing and a young man with a severed arm alongside an explanation of the charity's work. \"Wallpaper rejected the ad without giving an explanation and Harpers &amp; Queen said the creative work was too strong,\" said Medecins sans Frontieres campaigns officer Nerissa Bryden. A Wallpaper spokeswoman said the campaign was \"too explicit\" for the magazine's readers. \"This doesn't represent a stance on charity ads, it's just that in this specific case it was not right,\" she added. A million of the hard-hitting inserts will appear in travel magazines, style magazines and national newspapers urging people to commit to a regular monthly donation to the charity. They form part of a major marketing drive by MSF, which is also putting together its first-ever television commercial. \"The proliferation of new channels makes television advertising more appropriate for us because it means we can reach our target audience,\" said Ms Bryden.",

      "bodyText": "A baffling five-year-old mystery appears to have been resolved this week with the discovery at an isolated Texas ranch of a shallow grave full of charred bones. The police believe that the remains answer the nagging question of what happened to one of America's most celebrated atheists, Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who disappeared in 1995 along with her son and her adopted granddaughter. O'Hair had been almost single-handedly responsible for forcing a supreme court decision in 1963 which banned prayer in school, and there were many Christians, unreconciled to the separation of church and state, who never forgave her. She liked to call herself the most hated woman in America. So when she and her family went missing, there were some who said that she had been done away with by vengeful fundamentalists, and others who speculated that she had run away with $500,000 in gold coins taken from her organisation, the United Secularists of America. It now appears that she was forced to order the transfer of the bullion in the belief that it would save the lives of her family. Her former office manager, David Waters, is currently facing kidnapping and extortion charges in connection to O'Hair's abduction, and, as part of a plea-deal, he led them to the dusty grave on a private ranch in south Texas. According to investigators, the two-foot grave contained the three headless skeletons, all of which had had their legs severed. Three skulls and a metal artificial hip were found nearby. O'Hair, who was 77 when she disappeared, had had hip-replacement surgery a few years earlier. Investigators are now trying to trace the serial number on the artificial hip and check dental remains, but there is little doubt about the identity of the remains. Waters had been convicted in 1993 for embezzling money from O'Hair's group while working as the office manager. After that - according to his ex-girlfriend, Patti Jo Steffens - Waters became obsessed with revenge on O'Hair. A man he met in jail, Gary Karr, was convicted last August of taking part in the extortion scheme. The body of a third member of the gang, Danny Fry, was found - minus hands and head - in a Dallas river in 1995, a month after the kidnapping. The most surprising thing about the whole case was how long it took to solve - a fact which seems linked to her generally unpopular and bullying personality and to her atheism. Her own son, William Murray, did not report her missing for a year, even though she had disappeared with his daughter, Robin and his brother, Jon. Even after it became clear how horrifically his relatives had died, William Murray, now an evangelical preacher and lobbyist, did not seem ready to forgive O'Hair for her lack of religious beliefs. \"I think it's a shame that my mother took anyone with her, that she led other people into circumstances that cost them their lives,\" he said. \"My brother and daughter spent their entire years in a dysfunctional home and died horrible deaths, and that's part of my mother's legacy.\" Email julian.borger@theguardian.com Other articles More articles by Julian Borger",

Two months after he offloaded Express Newspapers and its websites, the Labour peer has written to the NUJ. In the letter, he expressed his \"concern\" and \"surprise\" at the way the new owner Richard Desmond has treated staff. Lord Hollick revealed he has been pressing Mr Desmond since early December to honour commitments to staff left without jobs after the sites were sold to an accountancy friend for \u00a31. The letter comes six weeks after Express Digital Media was put into administration by Seymour Pierce, the investment company that bought the online business. Lord Hollick said when he sold the sites to Mr Desmond he insisted on \"an undertaking from the purchaser that all employee rights would be protected\". \"We have contacted Northern &amp; Shell on a number of occasions since the beginning of December to make sure that this undertaking was being honoured. \"The situation with the website employees is particularly concerning,\" he wrote. \"United was surprised to see the sites transferred to a third party, who apparently tried to sell them and then closed them in short order. \"We made it clear to Northern &amp; Shell we believe there is an obligation for Express Newspapers to pay redundancy,\" he continued. It is the first sign of Lord Hollick showing compassion for the fate of 46 of his former employees since he offloaded them onto Mr Desmond. However, his late intervention has failed to impress former staff, who were left on the streets shortly before Christmas with neither pay nor redundancy money. Staff from EDM have even said they have found Mr Desmond and administrator Seymour Pierce to be \"more human and sympathetic over this whole affair\" than Lord Hollick. When MediaGuardian.co.uk called former Express.co.uk editor Michael Streeter for a reaction on the letter, he said he was more angered by Lord Hollick's \"crocodile tears\" than his silence. \"The letter seems like complete hypocrisy,\" he said. \"It sounds like he's trying to offload the blame onto others and avoid taking on any responsibility himself.\" Former EDM staff are working with their unions and lawyers on a settlement to claim the unpaid salaries and redundancy money.",

      "byline": "Giles Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The VW Passat is a road car which, in a rare twist these days, has no ambitions whatsoever to be an off-road car. Flying in the face of the contemporary fondness for vehicles that look like they could be driven across fields and through bogs - even if they couldn't and won't be - VW presents the Passat as a saloon for smooth stretches of tarmac. </p> <p>\"You'll want to keep it that way,\" goes the slogan on the advertisements for the car, in which Passat owners are witnessed preferring to lock the car and walk through safari parks or set out on foot across the highlands, rather than risk the possibility of damage to their vehicle by animals or loose chippings. </p> <p>Even in its new form, the Passat comes with no big lumps of plastic to protect the paintwork from bullrushes and no additional heated towel-rails bolted to the front to see off bullying kangaroos and incautious schoolchildren. You can buy a four-wheel-drive version, but VW isn't making much of a fuss about that. This is one for the road, and only the road. </p> <p>It still has the big sweeping roof and loopy wheel arches of the VW Beetle, which were borrowed as part of VW's plan to make a car which looked slightly happier than normal to be a saloon - this being a sector more usually associated with dignity and dullness. </p> <p>Still, the new Passat attempts to raise a quiet smile. The front end has been radically altered - a creased bonnet sloping down to a chunky new grille and a VW badge the size of a football. The dashboard lights up in a shade of lilac unseen since the decline of the kaftan. Yet, despite these \"fun\" touches, the car still feels rather imposingly serious and adult. You can imagine very little take-up for it among, say, rich students - or anyone, really, under the age of about 45. In a golf club car park, it might look a slightly racy choice. Elsewhere, it's going to look safe as houses. </p> <p>Things have changed in the redesign, mostly for the better. For instance, according to VW, the new Passat is \"10% more torsionally rigid\". It's something that happens to all of us as we grow older, though that doesn't automatically mean that we become, like the Passat, \"a stiffer, safer, quieter vehicle which is more refined on the road\". </p> <p>The new model is taller than the outgoing one: a full three millimetres taller. I defy anyone without a doctorate in aerodynamics and their own personal wind tunnel to appreciate the consequences of this - though I guess it does allow exceptionally tall drivers up to a week's additional growth of hair before they come to feel uncomfortable in the vehicle. </p> <p>The car is, however, 28mm longer, and this is an apprecia ble difference, as anyone trying to back the new model into a confined parking space will rapidly realise. In only a week of testing in densely populated urban conditions, I hit the following stationary vehicles with the rear end of my Passat: a Volvo estate, a fairly old-looking Peugeot 205 and one of those nice, sporty BMW Z3s. Apologies to all concerned. But at the same time, there was no damage done - or certainly not to the Passat, which is the important thing. Robust, then, as well as long, stiff, safe and quiet. </p> <p>I drove a diesel version, which was almost certainly a big mistake. The image of diesel engines has undergone something of a makeover. At Rover and elsewhere, important work is under way on the construction of a diesel engine that doesn't sound like a Post Office van and drive like a handcart. BMW has fitted its 330 saloon with a diesel engine quiet enough and quick enough to satisfy Jenson Button, who was caught doing 147mph in it. If car manufacturing was fashion, people would be trying to say that diesel was the new petrol. Even Jeremy Clarkson has recently written approvingly of a diesel engine, which is something like the Archbishop of Canterbury converting to Catholicism. </p> <p>In the Passat TDi, alas, the revolution has yet to take place. Ticking over, the engine still rattles like a crate of empty milk bottles. True, it will pin your neck to the headrest with one hearty push of the accelerator in second gear, but the noise will have you imagining you're in a fighter plane. The petrol engines are, I presume, more in keeping with the car's finish. </p> <p>And the Passat is - nobody could deny - well finished. Among a number of entertaining tweaks, the cup holders, between the driver's seat and the passenger's seat, are larger than they used to be - in response, one assumes, to retailers' ever more generous assessments of what constitutes a regular coffee. If this trend continues, cars will soon have to come with a tank for beverages, much as they now come with tanks for oil and petrol. </p> <p>Best of all, though, is that you can now make the air conditioning function inside the glove compartment. Never again will you need to worry whether your tinned sweets and tissues are the same temperature as you are. The road is long; these are important considerations.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The VW Passat is a road car which, in a rare twist these days, has no ambitions whatsoever to be an off-road car. Flying in the face of the contemporary fondness for vehicles that look like they could be driven across fields and through bogs - even if they couldn't and won't be - VW presents the Passat as a saloon for smooth stretches of tarmac. \"You'll want to keep it that way,\" goes the slogan on the advertisements for the car, in which Passat owners are witnessed preferring to lock the car and walk through safari parks or set out on foot across the highlands, rather than risk the possibility of damage to their vehicle by animals or loose chippings. Even in its new form, the Passat comes with no big lumps of plastic to protect the paintwork from bullrushes and no additional heated towel-rails bolted to the front to see off bullying kangaroos and incautious schoolchildren. You can buy a four-wheel-drive version, but VW isn't making much of a fuss about that. This is one for the road, and only the road. It still has the big sweeping roof and loopy wheel arches of the VW Beetle, which were borrowed as part of VW's plan to make a car which looked slightly happier than normal to be a saloon - this being a sector more usually associated with dignity and dullness. Still, the new Passat attempts to raise a quiet smile. The front end has been radically altered - a creased bonnet sloping down to a chunky new grille and a VW badge the size of a football. The dashboard lights up in a shade of lilac unseen since the decline of the kaftan. Yet, despite these \"fun\" touches, the car still feels rather imposingly serious and adult. You can imagine very little take-up for it among, say, rich students - or anyone, really, under the age of about 45. In a golf club car park, it might look a slightly racy choice. Elsewhere, it's going to look safe as houses. Things have changed in the redesign, mostly for the better. For instance, according to VW, the new Passat is \"10% more torsionally rigid\". It's something that happens to all of us as we grow older, though that doesn't automatically mean that we become, like the Passat, \"a stiffer, safer, quieter vehicle which is more refined on the road\". The new model is taller than the outgoing one: a full three millimetres taller. I defy anyone without a doctorate in aerodynamics and their own personal wind tunnel to appreciate the consequences of this - though I guess it does allow exceptionally tall drivers up to a week's additional growth of hair before they come to feel uncomfortable in the vehicle. The car is, however, 28mm longer, and this is an apprecia ble difference, as anyone trying to back the new model into a confined parking space will rapidly realise. In only a week of testing in densely populated urban conditions, I hit the following stationary vehicles with the rear end of my Passat: a Volvo estate, a fairly old-looking Peugeot 205 and one of those nice, sporty BMW Z3s. Apologies to all concerned. But at the same time, there was no damage done - or certainly not to the Passat, which is the important thing. Robust, then, as well as long, stiff, safe and quiet. I drove a diesel version, which was almost certainly a big mistake. The image of diesel engines has undergone something of a makeover. At Rover and elsewhere, important work is under way on the construction of a diesel engine that doesn't sound like a Post Office van and drive like a handcart. BMW has fitted its 330 saloon with a diesel engine quiet enough and quick enough to satisfy Jenson Button, who was caught doing 147mph in it. If car manufacturing was fashion, people would be trying to say that diesel was the new petrol. Even Jeremy Clarkson has recently written approvingly of a diesel engine, which is something like the Archbishop of Canterbury converting to Catholicism. In the Passat TDi, alas, the revolution has yet to take place. Ticking over, the engine still rattles like a crate of empty milk bottles. True, it will pin your neck to the headrest with one hearty push of the accelerator in second gear, but the noise will have you imagining you're in a fighter plane. The petrol engines are, I presume, more in keeping with the car's finish. And the Passat is - nobody could deny - well finished. Among a number of entertaining tweaks, the cup holders, between the driver's seat and the passenger's seat, are larger than they used to be - in response, one assumes, to retailers' ever more generous assessments of what constitutes a regular coffee. If this trend continues, cars will soon have to come with a tank for beverages, much as they now come with tanks for oil and petrol. Best of all, though, is that you can now make the air conditioning function inside the glove compartment. Never again will you need to worry whether your tinned sweets and tissues are the same temperature as you are. The road is long; these are important considerations.",

      "byline": "Luke Harding",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>The Guardian:</b> There has been much speculation about your imminent return to Pakistan. In a recent interview you said you had your \"bags packed\" ready for departure. When do you think this might happen? <p><b>Bhutto:</b> I'd like to return sooner than later. Pakistan is my country. My ancestors lived there before Pakistan came into being. I am the twice-elected prime minister removed twice by the intelligence apparatus, which refused to bow before the people's will. I want my fundamental rights respected. They have been systematically and brutally trampled since 1977. My family has spent a cumulative 21 years in prison since then and 30 years in exile. My family's saga reflects the history of Pakistan where forces of dictatorship have battled the forces of democracy. Popular and democratic leaders are targeted with an attempt to eliminate them through perversion of justice and a smear campaign. This must stop if Pakistan is to join the civilised nations of the world by practising values enshrined in the United Nations and its human rights declarations.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> And what assurances would you need from General Musharraf given the outstanding corruption case against you?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> It's a miscommunication to say there is a corruption case against me. There are trumped up non-cases in a conspiracy to pervert justice. There are five attempts to pervert justice in my case and they are based on the same set of unproven papers. Given that the papers are unproven and the regime is without a single witness to prove them, a close look shows that I am the victim rather than the villain of the piece. The same set of unproven papers against me have been made into three cases against my husband and one against my mother.</p> <p>As far as Musharraf is concerned, he is an officer who has sworn to uphold the law. I expect him to do so by stopping my political victimisation and that of others. My party [the Pakistan People's Party] has called for the repeal of the NAB [National Accountability Bureau] law which violates due process, the withdrawal of politically motivated cases, the release of political prisoners and for the abandonment of the politics of select pardons. The NAB law of equity demands that the regime apply the same treatment to all those behind bars which they applied to Mr Nawaz Sharif.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the Musharraf regime showing such inclination in the near future. Although the euphoria, which greeted their arrival, has evaporated and their plans of economic revival, credible accountability and new leadership are in shambles, they are still to absorb the reality. The reality is that the process of political persecution, clothed in anti-corruption, which began with my ouster in Pakistan, has damaged the country. Many are calling Pakistan a failed state. Since my ouster, democracy has been dismantled, the judiciary undermined, the economy bankrupted. The only gain has been to the clerics who openly brandish their weapons and call for the Talibanisation of Pakistani society.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> What role do you see yourself playing once back in Pakistan?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> I see myself playing a political role in supporting democratic revival and the strengthening of a liberal and enlightened Pakistan, which works for peace in the region and gives the federating units equal treatment. There are a large number of people in Pakistan who support me and who elected me. Irrespective of whether the regime jails me, disqualifies me or seeks to restrict me in any other way, I remain the single most important political force in the country. The Benazir-led PPP is federal in nature. It has core constituents who support its liberal policies and record in office, which saw a boom economy. I expect to play a political role in Pakistan irrespective of how the regime treats me.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> And what prospects are there, if any, for a speedy return to democracy?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> The prospects look better with the unity of the political forces and the public disillusionment with the regime. The regime is now trying to play a geo-strategic card to stay in power. Hence the picking up of the peace process [with India over Kashmir]. But a country internally divided and polarised is a greater threat to peace and stability than one united.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> Your successor as prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, is now in exile in Saudi Arabia following a deal last month with Pakistan's military rulers. What do you make of his release and would you countenance a similar deal for your husband, Asif Ali Zardari, still in prison after four years on corruption charges?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> Nawaz Sharif made his choice and there's little point in commenting on it now it's done. Nawaz had just begun his sentence. My husband is in a different boat. In Pakistan, you get bailed out on corruption charges in four months. Under statutory law, an under-trial prisoner is freed after two years in prison even if it's a murder trial. Senator Zardari is being held contrary to law due to political persecution. Ordinarily, he should be free. Four courts have given him medical bail and the regime has blocked it by obtaining a stay from the supreme court contrary to the law of consistency.</p> <p>Senator Zardari's prison term is completed even before his appeal is heard. Since 1990, this is his eighth year in prison. That's the punishment a male spouse gets in an Islamic country where fundamentalists control key institutions. It's inhuman and barbaric. They've tried to take his life, his liberty, his property, reputation, right to family. Both of us have been told we'd be better off if we left each other. So they've even tried to take our marriage. By the grace of God, we have survived the test and remained loyal to each other, our family and our political commitment to our party and our people. I believe in fighting for truth and justice irrespective of the odds.</p> <p>Nawaz had taken 6bn rupee loans from Pakistan state banks starting from the time when the rupee was fifteen to the dollar. He had mortgaged the property to the banks in lieu of the loans. As far as Senator Zardari is concerned, he has yet to take loans from public sector banks and therefore his properties have little to do with the state. Now if the state wishes to hold him hostage and demand a ransom, I would say they have yet to do that with Nawaz. I would also ask why they want a ransom from someone from a smaller province when they refused to take a ransom from someone from the majority province. It's wrong. The racial discrimination that has been indulged in is appalling. Senator Zardari should be freed on merit and so should the others who are being held as political pawns in a power struggle between the unelected security apparatus and the elected representatives.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> Britain's home secretary Jack Straw last month announced that he was freezing your assets in the UK.</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> That's incorrect. The British high commissioner was quoted in the press as stating so.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> The British government is also cooperating with the authorities in Islamabad, who are investigating money allegedly stolen by you during your time in power.</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> That's incorrect. It assumes that I have stolen money and that assumption is a slur. Moreover, Islamabad has still to make such a charge against me in any country. In England, they have sought assistance on a trumped up narcotics charge against my spouse and in Switzerland there is an investigation to see whether I influenced a contract to benefit my husband. Islamabad has been unable to provide Geneva with a single witness that I influenced the contract. Whereas I am prepared to produce witnesses who were threatened to commit perjury and pervert justice in a bid to get me in the Swiss case. I can produce them before the United Nations rapporteur on judges and the judiciary if Islamabad rakes up the courage to invite him in on the subject. Or Mary Robinson of the United Nations high commission for human rights.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> What do you think of Mr Straw's move?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> I wish he would review it keeping in mind Pakistan's circumstances and the pressure the judiciary is under. He is involved in a process to assist Islamabad on a request related to a trumped up narcotics charge. I believe Mr Straw should reject a request by a military dictator, a request based on torture, a patently fabricated case that carries with it the death penalty. For Mr Straw it's just a request. For my family, it's the threat of death in a country where a handful of judges previously sentenced an innocent prime minister who happened to be my father. Irrespective of the lack of evidence, a Pakistani court can get legitimacy to use British assistance to obfuscate the case and give the death sentence. Particularly when the judge happens to be the relative of the man who hanged my father. Even if Musharraf says he won't carry out a death sentence, he could change his mind tomorrow or put in on the courts. The two defendants, Arif Balauch and Shorang Khan, on whose disputed statements this charge was made, were tortured to pervert justice. Their torture marks have been recorded by the high court in Pakistan. The former interior minister is on record stating that the case was concocted.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> There is confusion as to the extent of your assets in the UK. Could you clarify what properties you do own, and whether they include Rockwood House, a nine-bedroom mansion in Surrey allegedly bought by Mr Zardari?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> Whatever I do own, I own legitimately through inherited, invested and earned money. My husband and I both hail from privileged families. Nothing we own is tied to any illegal activity. As far as Rockwood House is concerned, without prejudice to defence, if my husband has bought it under Pakistani and international law, which allows for transfer of money under tax free administrations, it is his legal right to do so. The Karachi house he lived in before we married is worth more than Rockwood. We have repeatedly asked for [proof of] a link to defrauding the public exchequer. The regimes have failed to give these links other than make empty declarations because they know we are innocent of wrongdoing.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> There are reports that, given the British government's ongoing investigation, you have moved permanently from London to Dubai. Is this true and do you have plans to return to Britain in the near future?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> This is incorrect. The British government investigation started on a request made to it in September 1997 in relation to my husband. I moved to Dubai for family reasons in 2000. I do have plans to return to Britain. I was there for a few days last August, September, October and November. I go there pretty frequently, stopping on my way to Europe or America.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> In an interview with the Guardian in September, Mr Zardari admitted he had behaved \"improperly in being extravagant\" while you were prime minister but said that his only crime was to \"marry Islam's first woman prime minister\". Do you agree?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> I do believe that my husband is more sinned against than sinning. He reminds me of Shakespeare's King Lear. Pakistan is a traditional male society in many ways.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> How difficult has it been to live apart from your husband for such a long period, and how has this enforced separation affected your children?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> I have been married for 13 years and my husband has begun his eighth year in prison. He has been tortured and was almost killed in custody. Whilst in Pakistan, I sent my children overseas for fear they saw their mother arrested, too. It saddens me when I think of how heavy a price we have paid. My children have missed out on having a father in the crucial years of their upbringing. I have missed having my husband share my life in the bloom of life. The years have taken their toll and we both suffer from hypertension. I block out what I am going through because when I think of it I become all teary eyed.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> How, also, do you keep in touch?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> We write to each other and send each other cards and books.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> You recently blamed your downfall as prime minister on Osama bin Laden. Could you elaborate?</p> <p><b>Bhutto:</b> That is partially correct. I said that the extremist forces that fought the jihad in Afghanistan wanted to make Pakistan a base and thus targeted my government and my family. Long before the world heard of Osama Bin Laden, he was funding sitting Pakistani generals (now retired) and Mr Sharif in a bid to overthrow my government. He had worked with them during the days of General Zia. These spooks also had great credibility in the western world, which had cooperated in the Afghan jihad. In 1989 Osama paid 10m dollars to overthrow my government through a no confidence move and interfere in Pakistan's politics. In 1993, Ramzi Yusuf, the [convicted of bombing] the World Trade Center in New York, made two attempts to assassinate me to prevent my election. In 1996, I briefed my cabinet that a conspiracy was being hatched to overthrow the government to strengthen extremist forces and use religion, the sharia, to enforce a takeover.</p> <p><b>The Guardian:</b> There are tentative signs of a peace process in Kashmir. Do you think India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is sincere in his negotiations over Kashmir and is there any real prospect of a lasting settlement after half a century of mistrust?</p> <p> <b>Bhutto:</b> The Indian government has adopted a proactive policy with regard to the peace process. I am unsure as to whether this will lead to a lasting settlement. A lasting settlement needs the acquiescence of the people and under a military dictatorship that is difficult to obtain. Cynics say the Musharraf regime is playing good cop on Kashmir to get breathing space for the Afghan UN sanctions issue to blow over. For the sake of the people of the subcontinent and the people of Kashmir, I hope otherwise. A successful peace process can usher in a new era for south Asians in this new century.</p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/pakistan/\">Pakistan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/kashmir/\">India and Pakistan</a><br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4103360,00.html\">11.12.2000: Pakistan frees Sharif to exile in Saudi Arabia</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4070026,00.html\">30.09.2000: Bhutto's jailed husband admits mistakes</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4069994,00.html\">29.09.2000: Interview with Asif Ali Zardari</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3854828,00.html\">16.04.1999: Benazir Bhutto given five-year jail term and \u00a35m fine for corruption</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3841525,00.html\">21.03.1999: Bhutto in last-ditch fight for survival</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pak.gov.pk/\" target=\"_new\">Pakistani government</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com\" target=\"_new\">Dawn (Pakistani news service)</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.timesofindia.com/\" target=\"_new\">Times of India</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.paktoday.com/\" target=\"_new\">Pakistan Today</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/pk.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA world factbook: Pakistan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.mnet.fr/aiindex/\" target=\"_new\">South Asia citizens' network</a></p>",

They have been systematically and brutally trampled since 1977. My family has spent a cumulative 21 years in prison since then and 30 years in exile. My family's saga reflects the history of Pakistan where forces of dictatorship have battled the forces of democracy. Popular and democratic leaders are targeted with an attempt to eliminate them through perversion of justice and a smear campaign. This must stop if Pakistan is to join the civilised nations of the world by practising values enshrined in the United Nations and its human rights declarations. The Guardian: And what assurances would you need from General Musharraf given the outstanding corruption case against you? Bhutto: It's a miscommunication to say there is a corruption case against me. There are trumped up non-cases in a conspiracy to pervert justice. There are five attempts to pervert justice in my case and they are based on the same set of unproven papers. Given that the papers are unproven and the regime is without a single witness to prove them, a close look shows that I am the victim rather than the villain of the piece. The same set of unproven papers against me have been made into three cases against my husband and one against my mother. As far as Musharraf is concerned, he is an officer who has sworn to uphold the law. I expect him to do so by stopping my political victimisation and that of others. My party [the Pakistan People's Party] has called for the repeal of the NAB [National Accountability Bureau] law which violates due process, the withdrawal of politically motivated cases, the release of political prisoners and for the abandonment of the politics of select pardons. The NAB law of equity demands that the regime apply the same treatment to all those behind bars which they applied to Mr Nawaz Sharif. There is little prospect of the Musharraf regime showing such inclination in the near future. Although the euphoria, which greeted their arrival, has evaporated and their plans of economic revival, credible accountability and new leadership are in shambles, they are still to absorb the reality. The reality is that the process of political persecution, clothed in anti-corruption, which began with my ouster in Pakistan, has damaged the country. Many are calling Pakistan a failed state. Since my ouster, democracy has been dismantled, the judiciary undermined, the economy bankrupted. The only gain has been to the clerics who openly brandish their weapons and call for the Talibanisation of Pakistani society. The Guardian: What role do you see yourself playing once back in Pakistan? Bhutto: I see myself playing a political role in supporting democratic revival and the strengthening of a liberal and enlightened Pakistan, which works for peace in the region and gives the federating units equal treatment. There are a large number of people in Pakistan who support me and who elected me. Irrespective of whether the regime jails me, disqualifies me or seeks to restrict me in any other way, I remain the single most important political force in the country. The Benazir-led PPP is federal in nature. It has core constituents who support its liberal policies and record in office, which saw a boom economy. I expect to play a political role in Pakistan irrespective of how the regime treats me. The Guardian: And what prospects are there, if any, for a speedy return to democracy? Bhutto: The prospects look better with the unity of the political forces and the public disillusionment with the regime. The regime is now trying to play a geo-strategic card to stay in power. Hence the picking up of the peace process [with India over Kashmir]. But a country internally divided and polarised is a greater threat to peace and stability than one united. The Guardian: Your successor as prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, is now in exile in Saudi Arabia following a deal last month with Pakistan's military rulers. What do you make of his release and would you countenance a similar deal for your husband, Asif Ali Zardari, still in prison after four years on corruption charges? Bhutto: Nawaz Sharif made his choice and there's little point in commenting on it now it's done. Nawaz had just begun his sentence. My husband is in a different boat. In Pakistan, you get bailed out on corruption charges in four months. Under statutory law, an under-trial prisoner is freed after two years in prison even if it's a murder trial. Senator Zardari is being held contrary to law due to political persecution. Ordinarily, he should be free. Four courts have given him medical bail and the regime has blocked it by obtaining a stay from the supreme court contrary to the law of consistency. Senator Zardari's prison term is completed even before his appeal is heard. Since 1990, this is his eighth year in prison. That's the punishment a male spouse gets in an Islamic country where fundamentalists control key institutions. It's inhuman and barbaric. They've tried to take his life, his liberty, his property, reputation, right to family. Both of us have been told we'd be better off if we left each other. So they've even tried to take our marriage. By the grace of God, we have survived the test and remained loyal to each other, our family and our political commitment to our party and our people. I believe in fighting for truth and justice irrespective of the odds. Nawaz had taken 6bn rupee loans from Pakistan state banks starting from the time when the rupee was fifteen to the dollar. He had mortgaged the property to the banks in lieu of the loans. As far as Senator Zardari is concerned, he has yet to take loans from public sector banks and therefore his properties have little to do with the state. Now if the state wishes to hold him hostage and demand a ransom, I would say they have yet to do that with Nawaz. I would also ask why they want a ransom from someone from a smaller province when they refused to take a ransom from someone from the majority province. It's wrong. The racial discrimination that has been indulged in is appalling. Senator Zardari should be freed on merit and so should the others who are being held as political pawns in a power struggle between the unelected security apparatus and the elected representatives. The Guardian: Britain's home secretary Jack Straw last month announced that he was freezing your assets in the UK. Bhutto: That's incorrect. The British high commissioner was quoted in the press as stating so. The Guardian: The British government is also cooperating with the authorities in Islamabad, who are investigating money allegedly stolen by you during your time in power. Bhutto: That's incorrect. It assumes that I have stolen money and that assumption is a slur. Moreover, Islamabad has still to make such a charge against me in any country. In England, they have sought assistance on a trumped up narcotics charge against my spouse and in Switzerland there is an investigation to see whether I influenced a contract to benefit my husband. Islamabad has been unable to provide Geneva with a single witness that I influenced the contract. Whereas I am prepared to produce witnesses who were threatened to commit perjury and pervert justice in a bid to get me in the Swiss case. I can produce them before the United Nations rapporteur on judges and the judiciary if Islamabad rakes up the courage to invite him in on the subject. Or Mary Robinson of the United Nations high commission for human rights. The Guardian: What do you think of Mr Straw's move? Bhutto: I wish he would review it keeping in mind Pakistan's circumstances and the pressure the judiciary is under. He is involved in a process to assist Islamabad on a request related to a trumped up narcotics charge. I believe Mr Straw should reject a request by a military dictator, a request based on torture, a patently fabricated case that carries with it the death penalty. For Mr Straw it's just a request. For my family, it's the threat of death in a country where a handful of judges previously sentenced an innocent prime minister who happened to be my father. Irrespective of the lack of evidence, a Pakistani court can get legitimacy to use British assistance to obfuscate the case and give the death sentence. Particularly when the judge happens to be the relative of the man who hanged my father. Even if Musharraf says he won't carry out a death sentence, he could change his mind tomorrow or put in on the courts. The two defendants, Arif Balauch and Shorang Khan, on whose disputed statements this charge was made, were tortured to pervert justice. Their torture marks have been recorded by the high court in Pakistan. The former interior minister is on record stating that the case was concocted. The Guardian: There is confusion as to the extent of your assets in the UK. Could you clarify what properties you do own, and whether they include Rockwood House, a nine-bedroom mansion in Surrey allegedly bought by Mr Zardari? Bhutto: Whatever I do own, I own legitimately through inherited, invested and earned money. My husband and I both hail from privileged families. Nothing we own is tied to any illegal activity. As far as Rockwood House is concerned, without prejudice to defence, if my husband has bought it under Pakistani and international law, which allows for transfer of money under tax free administrations, it is his legal right to do so. The Karachi house he lived in before we married is worth more than Rockwood. We have repeatedly asked for [proof of] a link to defrauding the public exchequer. The regimes have failed to give these links other than make empty declarations because they know we are innocent of wrongdoing. The Guardian: There are reports that, given the British government's ongoing investigation, you have moved permanently from London to Dubai. Is this true and do you have plans to return to Britain in the near future? Bhutto: This is incorrect. The British government investigation started on a request made to it in September 1997 in relation to my husband. I moved to Dubai for family reasons in 2000. I do have plans to return to Britain. I was there for a few days last August, September, October and November. I go there pretty frequently, stopping on my way to Europe or America. The Guardian: In an interview with the Guardian in September, Mr Zardari admitted he had behaved \"improperly in being extravagant\" while you were prime minister but said that his only crime was to \"marry Islam's first woman prime minister\". Do you agree? Bhutto: I do believe that my husband is more sinned against than sinning. He reminds me of Shakespeare's King Lear. Pakistan is a traditional male society in many ways. The Guardian: How difficult has it been to live apart from your husband for such a long period, and how has this enforced separation affected your children? Bhutto: I have been married for 13 years and my husband has begun his eighth year in prison. He has been tortured and was almost killed in custody. Whilst in Pakistan, I sent my children overseas for fear they saw their mother arrested, too. It saddens me when I think of how heavy a price we have paid. My children have missed out on having a father in the crucial years of their upbringing. I have missed having my husband share my life in the bloom of life. The years have taken their toll and we both suffer from hypertension. I block out what I am going through because when I think of it I become all teary eyed. The Guardian: How, also, do you keep in touch? Bhutto: We write to each other and send each other cards and books. The Guardian: You recently blamed your downfall as prime minister on Osama bin Laden. Could you elaborate? Bhutto: That is partially correct. I said that the extremist forces that fought the jihad in Afghanistan wanted to make Pakistan a base and thus targeted my government and my family. Long before the world heard of Osama Bin Laden, he was funding sitting Pakistani generals (now retired) and Mr Sharif in a bid to overthrow my government. He had worked with them during the days of General Zia. These spooks also had great credibility in the western world, which had cooperated in the Afghan jihad. In 1989 Osama paid 10m dollars to overthrow my government through a no confidence move and interfere in Pakistan's politics. In 1993, Ramzi Yusuf, the [convicted of bombing] the World Trade Center in New York, made two attempts to assassinate me to prevent my election. In 1996, I briefed my cabinet that a conspiracy was being hatched to overthrow the government to strengthen extremist forces and use religion, the sharia, to enforce a takeover. The Guardian: There are tentative signs of a peace process in Kashmir. Do you think India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is sincere in his negotiations over Kashmir and is there any real prospect of a lasting settlement after half a century of mistrust? Bhutto: The Indian government has adopted a proactive policy with regard to the peace process. I am unsure as to whether this will lead to a lasting settlement. A lasting settlement needs the acquiescence of the people and under a military dictatorship that is difficult to obtain. Cynics say the Musharraf regime is playing good cop on Kashmir to get breathing space for the Afghan UN sanctions issue to blow over. For the sake of the people of the subcontinent and the people of Kashmir, I hope otherwise. A successful peace process can usher in a new era for south Asians in this new century.

The seven-week shoot begins in March in Salta in northern Argentina and then moves to Barcelona. Keitel is expected to join the set in April after finishing the Manuel Pradol drama, Le Volcan, in which he co-stars with Andie MacDowell",

An expert group under Malcolm Chisholm, deputy health minister, is to report in August. Between then and now a general election may intervene, which would not affect the balance of power in Edinburgh but might make the equations look different in London. </p> <p>Some have reacted as if this were the first social policy divergence between Scotland and England. But unit costs, especially in education, have been higher north of the border for a long time. The Barnett formula, which determines how much the Scottish executive gets, was designed in the 1970s better to align spending and need across the United Kingdom; it has not done a good job. Scottish health spending as a proportion of Scottish GDP is well above the UK's. Indeed it is already at the fabled European Union average, which the UK as a whole will only reach - if Tony Blair is lucky - by 2004 or thereabouts. That depends on the EU average staying put. It looks as if it might rise from 8% of GDP to 10%, giving Labour another mountain to climb. </p> <p>On the face of it, Edinburgh has said yes to Sir Stewart Sutherland's report on long-term care* when London has so far said no. That things are not quite as simple as that is testimony to the Blair government's capacity to say one thing (usually of a rightish-wing kind) while doing another, often in a progressive direction. The fact is London has already gone a long way to meeting the Sutherland recommendations and reducing the cost of old-age incapacity. </p> <p>Sutherland's majority - the Labour peer David Lipsey lodged a powerful dissent in favour of rigorous means-testing - said elderly people looked after at home or in an institution should qualify for free \"bodily\" care. Such attention is free if they are in a bed on an NHS hospital ward. </p> <p>The chart shows how the UK's elderly will grow in number. The increase is steep after 2010 but less of a gradient than elsewhere in Europe. A working assumption is that one in three women and one in five men will need to be looked after; many will suffer from degenerative illness and dementia and require a lot of attention. Often family - if it exists - will not be able to cope and mum or dad will be accommodated in residential homes which will have to be paid for. Here is where the granny-sells-home tabloid scare starts. Under existing rules - oddly enough, the Tories were in this instance enthusiastic taxers of capital - care has to be paid for when older people have assets worth \u00a316,000 or more. </p> <p>Large proportions of health and social services budgets already go on the elderly - those over 65 account for two-thirds of hospital patients and 40% of all emergency admissions. Long-term care now costs something like \u00a38bn. It is hard to be exact because individuals' circumstances and costs are spread unevenly between the NHS and councils. </p> <p>Over the next half century costs will rise fourfold in real terms, to about \u00a327bn a year. But the economy will also grow, its historical annual average 2.5% a year. So, if the present system continued its cost as a share of GDP would increase only fractionally, from 1% to 1.1%. Sutherland - who did not propose getting rid of the \"hotel\" charges levied on residents of homes - would cost \u00a333bn by 2050 or 1.3% of GDP. </p> <p>Those figures would converge if Labour's grand plan for health set out last July by Alan Milburn came to fruition. The government line is that even before the national plan kicks in it is doing a lot to make older people better able to care for themselves (free health checks on retirement, for example) and be cared for. </p> <p>It has also, it says, gone a long way to meet Sutherland, for example by making nursing (an important part of personal care) free for elderly people in nursing homes. Plans are afoot to boost standards in homes, for closer liaison between the NHS and social services and prompt, sympathetic and simpler assessment of needs by social services. And there is money in the pipeline - an extra \u00a31bn plus by 2003-04 for beds outside hospitals, home adaptations (grab rails for example) and respite for carers. </p> <p>From April, the first three months of nursing in a home or at home will be subject to a means test that disregards whether an elderly person owns a home. It is a \"breathing space\", said Mr Milburn, to allow the possibility of a return home. Some 30,000 people a year may benefit. </p> <p>Councils are being told to be more consistent in what they count as capital and some of the assessment formulae frozen at 1996's levels. The complex finance of care in and out of council coffers will be simplified and stop (the government hopes) councils pushing old people into private sector homes because they are cheaper. </p> <p>As important as the emergent differences between Scotland and the rest of the UK are the similarities - the big issues unbroached in both. Should social services remain separate from the NHS? Why not a compulsory insurance scheme, pooling risks? The official line in London is that a private sector solution is being looked at, though everyone knows it is bound to leave out the many who can't or won't pay.

A spontaneous poll among the audience about the value of their wireless freebie, which tapped into the forum's computer information system, saw lots of hands go up when asked if it was useful. A few thought it was fun. But only one person claimed to understand how to use the device properly.",

      "body": "<p>Pressure for parents to be paid to stay at home with their young children intensified last night after a new report called for \"generous financial support\" to be offered to those who do for the first three years of their child's life. </p> <p>The independent childcare commission - set up to advise the government - suggested that increased child benefit or a \"toddler tax credit\" should be offered to all but the highest earners to enable them to pay for childcare, or to ensure they could afford to stay at home. The report is being scrutinised by the Treasury. </p> <p>While the commission - chaired by the former social security secretary, Harriet Harman, - failed to come up with a recommended figure, family groups believe it should be at least \u00a3150, nearly half women's average weekly income of \u00a3337. The move would cost the Treasury around \u00a33bn a year, but advocates argue that the cost is justified if childcare is recognised as a crucial area of public funding, alongside transport, hospitals and schools. </p> <p>The proposals were welcomed by the government, but described by the employment minister, Margaret Hodge, and Treasury officials as \"extremely expensive\". </p> <p>The report also called for a children's centre, providing high quality nursery and after-school care, to be set up in every area. Only 2,000 such centres exist and increasing the number to the required 10,000 would cost up to \u00a38bn, says the Treasury. </p> <p>Parents, who on average spend \u00a35,000 a year on child care, should also be helped by being granted tax relief to the basic rate on up to \u00a32,000 of childcare expenses per year, it says - a move that would cost an extra \u00a31bn a year. </p> <p>Employers should be offered tax breaks to encourage, rather than deter, them from improving childcare provision. They should also do more to improve flexibility for parents. </p> <p>But the commission stopped short of calling for legislation to make employers responsible for the provision or payment of childcare, and failed to suggest parents who remain at home for three years should have their jobs kept open. </p> <p>The commission, whose 12-month research covered parents, children and employers across the country, also proposes a government department of work and family services to drive through childcare policy. The move, which would ensure childcare was no longer handled in a piecemeal way by different departments, would signal the government's commitment to solving a problem affecting at least 6m mothers. </p> <p>Last night Ms Harman stressed: \"This needs to move up the agenda of public policy and needs to be recognised as a priority alongside transport and schools. Children are not a lifestyle choice - they are the future of this country. We depend on them.\" </p> <p>Family groups also welcomed the study. The Maternity Alliance, which campaigns for young parents' rights, said that implementing the report would cost peanuts in comparison with the costs borne by 700,000 couples who become new parents each year. \"At present, women are returning to work before they want to because they can't afford not to,\" said its director, Christine Gowdridge. </p> <p>The Tories also backed the recommendations, with the shadow social security secretary, David Willetts, claiming they revealed a welcome shift away from penalising mothers who stay at home. </p> <p>\"No one's saying women must stay at home, but this shows a neutrality,\" he said. \"This government has constructed a set of pressures in the tax and benefits system to favour parents to go out to work, but if you're at home you need assistance and support as well and this recognises that.\" </p> <p>But the report drew criticism from some employers, who feared its recommendations would be too costly. </p> <p>\"This will fall on taxpayers whether they are individuals or businesses,\" said Ruth Lea, of the Institute of Directors. \"I think there could be some resentment because they will be saying to themselves, 'I will be financing someone else's lifestyle choice'.\" </p> <p>Margaret Hodge described the report as \"a serious contribution to the development of childcare in this country\". </p> <p>She said: \"We are doing a lot of what the report is recommending. We have already created the largest ever expansion of childcare, we have created places for over half a million children and the working families tax credit offers generous support with childcare costs for lower income families. </p> <p>\"It is important not to rule anything out prior to a budget, but clearly some of these proposals would be extremely expensive.\" </p> <p><strong>New deal for young: the main points</strong></p> <p>\u0095 A children's centre should be set up in every area to provide high-quality nursery and after school care. With one centre catering for two to three schools, up to 10,000 should be built. Would be funded by a combination of state and parental support </p> <p>\u0095 Parents and other relatives should be offered \"generous financial support for family care\" for the first three years of the child's life. </p> <p>The money would be spent on childcare - either formal care, a nursery or childminder; or family care - parents or other relatives. </p> <p>Different options are mooted: an increase in child benefit for children up to three; a toddler tax credit for the first three years - available to all but those on the top rate of tax; or transferable tax allowance - available when one parent works and pays tax and the other stays at home - for the first three years </p> <p>\u0095 Tax relief for childcare on the basic rate of up to \u00a32,000 of childcare expenses per year </p> <p>\u0095 Increased flexibility and a change in the tax system to encourage family friendly employment patterns at work </p> <p>\u0095 A new government department of work and family services, which would be responsible for policy on childcare</p>",

Only 2,000 such centres exist and increasing the number to the required 10,000 would cost up to \u00a38bn, says the Treasury. Parents, who on average spend \u00a35,000 a year on child care, should also be helped by being granted tax relief to the basic rate on up to \u00a32,000 of childcare expenses per year, it says - a move that would cost an extra \u00a31bn a year. Employers should be offered tax breaks to encourage, rather than deter, them from improving childcare provision. They should also do more to improve flexibility for parents. But the commission stopped short of calling for legislation to make employers responsible for the provision or payment of childcare, and failed to suggest parents who remain at home for three years should have their jobs kept open. The commission, whose 12-month research covered parents, children and employers across the country, also proposes a government department of work and family services to drive through childcare policy. The move, which would ensure childcare was no longer handled in a piecemeal way by different departments, would signal the government's commitment to solving a problem affecting at least 6m mothers. Last night Ms Harman stressed: \"This needs to move up the agenda of public policy and needs to be recognised as a priority alongside transport and schools. Children are not a lifestyle choice - they are the future of this country. We depend on them.\" Family groups also welcomed the study. The Maternity Alliance, which campaigns for young parents' rights, said that implementing the report would cost peanuts in comparison with the costs borne by 700,000 couples who become new parents each year. \"At present, women are returning to work before they want to because they can't afford not to,\" said its director, Christine Gowdridge. The Tories also backed the recommendations, with the shadow social security secretary, David Willetts, claiming they revealed a welcome shift away from penalising mothers who stay at home. \"No one's saying women must stay at home, but this shows a neutrality,\" he said. \"This government has constructed a set of pressures in the tax and benefits system to favour parents to go out to work, but if you're at home you need assistance and support as well and this recognises that.\" But the report drew criticism from some employers, who feared its recommendations would be too costly. \"This will fall on taxpayers whether they are individuals or businesses,\" said Ruth Lea, of the Institute of Directors. \"I think there could be some resentment because they will be saying to themselves, 'I will be financing someone else's lifestyle choice'.\" Margaret Hodge described the report as \"a serious contribution to the development of childcare in this country\". She said: \"We are doing a lot of what the report is recommending. We have already created the largest ever expansion of childcare, we have created places for over half a million children and the working families tax credit offers generous support with childcare costs for lower income families. \"It is important not to rule anything out prior to a budget, but clearly some of these proposals would be extremely expensive.\" New deal for young: the main points \u0095 A children's centre should be set up in every area to provide high-quality nursery and after school care. With one centre catering for two to three schools, up to 10,000 should be built. Would be funded by a combination of state and parental support \u0095 Parents and other relatives should be offered \"generous financial support for family care\" for the first three years of the child's life. The money would be spent on childcare - either formal care, a nursery or childminder; or family care - parents or other relatives. Different options are mooted: an increase in child benefit for children up to three; a toddler tax credit for the first three years - available to all but those on the top rate of tax; or transferable tax allowance - available when one parent works and pays tax and the other stays at home - for the first three years \u0095 Tax relief for childcare on the basic rate of up to \u00a32,000 of childcare expenses per year \u0095 Increased flexibility and a change in the tax system to encourage family friendly employment patterns at work \u0095 A new government department of work and family services, which would be responsible for policy on childcare",

A senior paediatrician from Hampshire, he had decided to pop in on relatives in Ahmedabad on his way back from a lecture tour through India. He was only going to stay one night. </p> <p>But after breakfast the following morning, as he sat on a bed in the third floor of Akshardeep apartments, the ground started to heave. Dr Nathwani rushed to the door. He did not make it. \"A beam fell on his head. It was an instant death,\" his brother-in-law Narendra Mirani said yesterday. </p> <p>And yet the earthquake that ripped through the four-storey apartment block last Friday spared everyone else in the flat. Its haphazard impact flung Hardik, a 15-year-old relative who had been sitting next to Dr Nathwani, through the window and into a tree. Another relative, Pallavi, was having a bath when the tremors began. She plunged three storeys, but was rescued. </p> <p>Dr Nathwani's host, Kishor, also survived. \"He was in the lobby talking to neighbours. He ran towards the staircase. The staircase with everyone on it totally collapsed. Though the debris fell on him, he was visible so they pulled him out,\" Mr Mirani said. </p> <p>Not everyone in the building was so fortunate.

      "bodyText": "In the early hours of yesterday, Ashok Nathwani (above) should have been getting on a flight back to the UK. A senior paediatrician from Hampshire, he had decided to pop in on relatives in Ahmedabad on his way back from a lecture tour through India. He was only going to stay one night. But after breakfast the following morning, as he sat on a bed in the third floor of Akshardeep apartments, the ground started to heave. Dr Nathwani rushed to the door. He did not make it. \"A beam fell on his head. It was an instant death,\" his brother-in-law Narendra Mirani said yesterday. And yet the earthquake that ripped through the four-storey apartment block last Friday spared everyone else in the flat. Its haphazard impact flung Hardik, a 15-year-old relative who had been sitting next to Dr Nathwani, through the window and into a tree. Another relative, Pallavi, was having a bath when the tremors began. She plunged three storeys, but was rescued. Dr Nathwani's host, Kishor, also survived. \"He was in the lobby talking to neighbours. He ran towards the staircase. The staircase with everyone on it totally collapsed. Though the debris fell on him, he was visible so they pulled him out,\" Mr Mirani said. Not everyone in the building was so fortunate. Four people, including Dr Nathwani, died. Yesterday rescuers were still trying to dig one 16-year-old boy out from what used to be the parking bay. They know he is in there because one of his friends bumped into him as they fled in different directions. A Swiss rescue team that arrived over the weekend spent the morning combing the rubble with labrador sniffer dogs but found no sign of life. Last night Dr Nathwani's widow, Chhaya, flew to India with their two children, Ketul, 16, and Vivek, seven, from their home in Fareham.

In Bangalore, the hi-tech capital of the southern state of Karnataka, an aftershock of 4.4 on the Richter scale shortly after 8am yesterday sent office workers spilling out into the streets in panic; they stayed out all day. </p> <p>The rescue of the baby boy was one of the increasingly rare dramatic rescues in the devastated town of Bhuj where funeral pyres have been burning around the clock in the wake of Friday's earthquake. \"It was just miraculous,\" said RK Thakur, a Border Security Forces assistant commandant, who was among the rescue workers who found the baby, Murtza Ali, under a collapsed building in Kansara Market in the old city of Bhuj, the town nearest the centre of Friday's huge quake. </p> <p>His team was trying to recover the body of a woman from the rubble when they realised the blood-covered baby in her lap was alive. </p> <p>\"We saw the baby in the mother's lap, we saw some movement from the baby. I took the baby in my hand and I found it was alive,\" Mr Thakur said. </p> <p>The boy was rushed to a medical centre, where doctors later said he was conscious and smiling.

They had been trying to flee when the block's water tank fell on top of them. </p> <p>\"We managed to rescue one 21-year-old youth two days ago,\" Colonel Gopi Menon of the Indian army said. \"It took us 10 hours. Finally we got ropes around him and pulled him out. There are still five bodies left inside.\" </p> <p>Hundreds of people survived the initial impact only to die entombed on Friday and Saturday, while the authorities dawdled. </p> <p>The living, meanwhile, are already making the best of things. Looting has begun. In Bhachau, the town worst affected by the earthquake, survivors have started combing through the market, removing - among other things - odd shoes. Since almost everyone died here, there is no one around to complain. </p> <p><strong> Shattered</strong><br> </p> <p>In Bhuj, 188 prisoners have escaped from the shattered jail. And in Ahmedabad, householders were yesterday busy retrieving jewellery and other valuables from teeteringly unsafe buildings. </p> <p>\"There is a psychological panic,\" MH Hakwana, director of VS Hospital, said. \"There is a fear of another bout of earthquakes. Many of our patients are now in the garden because they are constantly afraid. We have erected big tents for them.\" </p> <p>Upstairs in the wards it is clear that the injured, like the dead, are mainly children and the elderly, those unable to escape quickly enough. Clearly overwhelmed, the government said it would ask for a \u00a31bn loan from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank for reconstruction. </p> <p>The Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, touring the devastation in Gujarat yesterday, announced a federal relief grant of \u00a376m and an extra \u00a32.11m from the prime minister's relief fund. </p> <p>He added that he was creating a national disaster agency to ensure immediate response to emergencies. \"The country is not ready to face such disasters.\" </p> <p>Survivors complained yesterday that confusion and a lack of equipment was hampering search efforts. Rescuers lacked cranes, bulldozers and generators for lights. Soldiers were beginning searches at first light and stopping at sunset. </p> <p>\"They work from 10am to 6pm only. This is emergency duty. They should work round the clock,\" said Pradeep Sheth, 46, who was rescued from under the rubble after seven hours. </p> <p>Mr Sheth, whose wife, mother and two daughters were still trapped in the debris, wondered how soldiers would clear the rubble. \"There are live people trapped inside. We can hear their sounds,\" he said. </p> <p>Jayesh Shah, a teacher, arrived at the hospital in Ahmedabad with his badly injured wife Deepti after a 10-hour bus journey from Bhuj. \"My son and I managed to get out of the house. But my wife was next door. She jumped out of the first floor. She was OK - but then a big stone hit her on the head. Blood keeps coming from her ears,\" he said. </p> <p>As dusk fell yesterday, members of the Ashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a rightwing Hindu group, were doling out puris and potato curry to the injured who were camped outside the hospital. </p> <p>Nearby, a group of Muslims were praying to Mecca on a white sheet. Others were rolling out bedsheets.

The return of News at Ten on ITV had beaten the BBC by a margin of almost two to one the previous evening. </p> <p>By the end of the day, ITN was fighting a rearguard action. While its bulletin had won the contest against the BBC, it now faced a potentially greater threat. With a typically bloodyminded sense of timing, Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB announced the formation of a consortium aiming to wrest the ITV news contract from ITN's hands. The present contract, which expires at the end of next year, is worth \u00a3200m. </p> <p>ITN was dismissive, but with an unusual venom, which suggested that BSkyB's hastily pulled together consortium had rattled the company. The consortium, which included US broadcaster CBS, Bloomberg, Chrysalis and Ulster TV, was, an ITN spokesman spat, \"a ragbag partnership crafted of desperation\". The ITV network was more diplomatic and welcomed the competition. </p> <p>This will be the fourth time that Mr Murdoch has challenged ITN's monopoly on the supply of news to commercial free-to-air TV. The first time, in 1996, BSkyB did not clear the starting blocks. Intending to bid alone, it was blocked because no shareholder in the news supplier to ITV can hold more than 20% of the company. </p> <p>More recently it has challenged for the Channel 4 and Channel 5 contracts, and lost both. Insiders at BSkyB believe it was used as a stalking horse. </p> <p>This is, then, the first time that ITN has faced genuine competition for a contract which accounts for about 45% of its revenues. It also comes at a sensitive time as shareholders in ITN contemplate a stockmarket flotation of the business which would be devastated if it lost its largest contract. </p> <p>When the network went on air in 1955, ITN was wholly owned by the ITV companies. That changed after the Broadcasting Act of 1990 through which, in typical Thatcherite style, ITN was granted greater independence with the quid pro quo of being forced to bid for the ITV contract. </p> <p>Reuters and the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust climbed on board as shareholders alongside the larger ITV companies, Granada Media, Carlton Communications and the then United News &amp; Media. </p> <p>The Murdoch alliance, which remains unnamed, has written to ITV outlining its intent to bid for the next contract. The present five-year deal is worth some \u00a340m a year. The consortium has also applied to the independent television commission for \"nominated news provider\" status. Any company hoping to bid for the ITV news contract must meet criteria designed to ensure quality. </p> <p>The BSkyB public relations machine has tellingly declined to put forward any of its own executives for interviews and, instead, has been encouraging other members of the consortium to talk. The company seems keen to play down its own, and thus Mr Murdoch's role, in the bid - no doubt in full knowledge of the press and politicians' tendency to demonise the media tycoon. For the moment, however, efforts are clearly being co-ordinated by the head of Sky News, Nick Pollard. </p> <p>BSkyB is keen to leverage the considerable resource of Sky News and to turn greater revenues from the channel. It has a budget of between \u00a330m and \u00a340m, depending on who you listen to, and is profitmaking or not, on the same basis. What is clear is that the channel faces increasing competition from ITN and BBC News 24 which, to BSkyB's chagrin, is given to cable companies free of charge. Sky News was forced off some cable channels when the BBC offered its cheaper alternative. </p> <p>BSkyB's chances will depend on the ITV club's solidarity. The ITV network maintains that the award of the next contract will be made on an impartial basis, but could Carlton and Granada stomach giving the contract away to their biggest rival? They might save money by awarding the deal to a BSkyB consortium but that would also undermine the value of their stakes in ITN. </p> <p>John Hardie, ITV's marketing and commercial director, will handle negotiations but the vote on the competing bids will be taken by the ITV council. This has representatives from the programme companies: Granada, Carlton, Ulster, Border and SMG, owner of the Scottish, Grampian and Channel franchises. ITV chairman Leslie Hill has the casting vote. </p> <p>It should be easy enough to guess which way Granada, Carlton and Ulster will vote. Others might be reluctant to risk change, though there is a suggestion that some in ITV are irked by their subsidy of ITN's loss-making cable channel. The smaller companies might be more cost-conscious and willing to try a new supplier. </p> <p><strong> 'It is bizarre'</strong><br> The BSkyB consortium is adopting a confident air. \"We are not afraid of competition or of what is perceived to be ITN's strong position,\" said Richard Huntingford, chief executive of Chrysalis. \"We firmly believe we can come up with a proposal with much more relevance to ITV.\" </p> <p>ITN is expected to attack the consortium on the spectre not only of Mr Murdoch, but the presence also of more than one US shareholder. One source said: \"In trying to disguise Murdoch's influence Sky News has put together a consortium which is essentially north American. It is bizarre. Parliament and press will have a field day.\" </p> <p>BSkyB's hasty announcement would appear to have been sparked by talk that ITN was pressing ITV for an early renewal of its contract ahead of a flotation. The prospect of an ITN flotation in the short term is fading but the urgency for BSkyB remains. Carlton and Granada are also lobbying the government to let them increase their interests in ITN over the set 20% after the sympathetic communications white paper. </p> <p>If the two largest ITV companies are allowed to bring ITN under the same roof, ending what many see as an anachronistic structure, this could be BSkyB's last chance to steal in.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A move to ban chemists selling the morning-after pill over the counter was firmly quashed last night after the House of Lords threw out an order brought by the family values campaigner Lady Young. Peers voted by 177 to 95 - a majority of 82 on a free vote - to reject a procedural motion which would have seen the pill withdrawn from chemists' shelves immediately. The pill - which would still have been available at doctors' surgeries, hospitals and family planning clinics - was made available over the counter to all women aged 16 and over from January 1 amid much controversy. Welcoming the defeat of the motion, the health minister, Lord Hunt, said: \"We are absolutely delighted at the result of this vote which is a major step forwards for women's health in the UK.\" Family planning groups also applauded it. The Family Planning Association argued peers would be guilty of \"an extraordinary attack on women's health\" if they had backed it, and said women needed access to the pill - which can be taken up to 72 hours after sex - as swiftly as possible to ensure it was most effective. The support for the government policy came about despite the Tories operating an unofficial whip to ensure their benches backed Lady Young, their one time leader in the Lords. But the Lib Dems, who turned out in force, redressed the balance by backing their health spokesman, who opposed the motion, Lord Clement-Jones. Bringing the order, Lady Young, who last year spearheaded the campaign to defeat the government on lowering the gay age of consent, warned that the emergency contraception, while intended for the over 16s, was being bought by girls younger than that age. Its sale at \u00a320 per pill sent out the signal that unprotected sex was permissable, said Lady Young. \"This is in fact exactly the opposite of what the sex education industry has been saying for at least 20 years. It is a very dangerous signal because it will increase the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases.\" She also suggested it was unsafe. \"Each treatment is 50 times more powerful than the previous contraceptive pill.

She said: \"In the real world, things sometimes go wrong with responsible people's normal method of contraception. \"Condoms split or come off and women forget to use the pill. \"Should we be trying to punish women by forcing them to have children they don't want?

But what if - as so often in life, and even more frequently on the internet - there is nothing sensible to be done? </p> <p>We can talk child pornography and adoption and the killers of James Bulger in a moment, though. This story begins almost six years ago when Steven Gan, an investigative reporter for the Sun, a Malaysian paper, wrote an expos\u00e9 of the evil conditions at Semenyih immigration detention camp in Selangor. Evil? Try brutality and squalor and rampant sickness - like typhoid - behind closed doors. Try 59 seekers of asylum dying in secret, unmourned and unmarked. Even Ann Widdecombe would find that a scandal. </p> <p>But Gan's story wasn't published. The Malaysian press is not free. It exists, amid some chafing misery, in the long, dark shadow of prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. Instead, in the end, Gan turned over his findings to a battling women's rights activist, Irene Fernandez, and she distributed the Semenyih dossiers at one of her rallies. At least, then, a tale that had to be told began to break surface. </p> <p>What happened next? Irene Fernandez was charged with \"criminal defamation\". Her trial - already the longest in Malaysian history- still continues. Translators for Bangladeshi defence witnesses from the camp seem to be in amazingly short supply. There have been 47 adjournments - yes, count them, 47 - for lack of a translator. And curiously, when one is available (as last week), the witness himself goes missing. If this shambles ever ends, Fernandez faces three years in prison. </p> <p>And Steven Gan? He had his farcical moment earlier: arrested, locked up, an Amnesty prisoner of conscience. But then he went on, just over a year ago, to found malayasiakini.com. You, like millions of Malaysians, can find it easily enough on the net. It is a paperless newspaper - and yesterday it won the Media Pioneer award (for valour) presented every year by the International Press Institute and Freedom Forum. </p> <p>The wonder of malayasiakini is how straightforward and solid it is. No hysteria, no vituperation: Gan and a dedicated team of professionals believe in news you can trust and measured comment. Their strength is that they cover the things the country's print papers have to bury or set to one side: the appointment of grotesquely unsuitable judges, the views of the opposition, the illness of Anwar Ibrahim, the ordeal of Irene Fernandez. They are measured and responsible: they are also virtually alone, the carriers of a torch. </p> <p>Why, you may wonder, doesn't Dr Mahathir do to them what he's done to Malaysia's conventional press? License it, with licences which can be (and are) summarily withdrawn? Or find a way, through party backwaters, of owning the journals which are supposed to call him to account? Here's the unique strength of the internet. </p> <p>A country like Malaysia, which has to be open for business, must also be open to the net. You can't have one without the other. Shut down or censor or try to block, and business gets a dire message. Opting out of the world wide web is opting out of your country's future. That is a step too far for Mahathir. He must grin and bear at least one outlet he can't control or intimidate. </p> <p>I could replicate the essential story of malasiakini.com many times over. The web site of the Mail and Guardian in Johannesburg (which this paper owns) has its own proud record for bringing news to the countries north of South Africa where a free press perennially struggles to survive. Later today (when I log on again) I'll find emails from all over the world from distant readers of Guardian Unlimited. There's a power here which is an immense force for good. It makes us one world not merely in the flashing of share prices and bid offers, but in the challenging of oppression and the exposure of devious dictatorship. </p> <p>But blessings, of course, are rarely unmitigated. Look at the headlines of the past few days. Police break up a (global) child pornography ring which grew on the net. The Kilshaws found their babies on the net. And something must be done. Ministers chafe and mutter, then duly warn web service providers that they face prosecution (under a 1971 act). Leave adoption to local authorities. Chris Smith's proposed Ofcom, most amorphous of future regulators, will have more of an e-role. We await, without eagerness, the first website to reveal the new identities and whereabouts of Venables and Thompson, who murdered James Bulger. </p> <p>Here, though, is the rub. Just like Dr Mahathir, we can't have one thing without the other. There's no choosing the good things about the net and conveniently banning the things we find bad. It is what is. Seek to constrict, to limit here or censor there, and the force is no longer with it. Imagine, as the line of principle bends and breaks, how Malaysia - and so many other dusty regimes - will rejoice. Imagine what will happen to Steven Gan and Irene Fernandez and the inmates of the camps. </p> <p>Do we shoot the messenger? That's the easy bit for politicians - though child porn and foreign adoption agencies can arrive by fax or phone or stamped, addressed envelope. But some of the choices are truly hard. I agree with Judge Elizabeth Butler Sloss that Venables and Thompson should be left alone to find a new life; I don't want vengeful mobs or crowds of reporters on their doorsteps. But how do you wrap them in a permanent blanket of silence? How do you seal them off for ever from the world? Judges may order these thing with the full authority of the law, yet they are still, coldly considered, impossible to sustain. These orders cannot hold through a lifetime. Some flickering screen, one day, will blow them to smithereens. And what do we do then? </p> <p>You need no gift of prophesy. Something will have to be done! And it won't necessarily be the politicians of the right who clamour loudest for action. That could just as easily come from the centre or left, making a case that Guardian readers can embrace. Tony Blair and Charlie Kennedy are always keen on doing something. They will have the best of short-term justifications and nobody will say a prayer for the long-term, nobody will remember that \"good\" interference - in logic and reality - admits the possibility of bad interference as well. </p> <p>Try to remember Steven Gan when that moment comes. Try to remember what he, and we, have to lose. Try to remember the nature of freedom - and the times when something mustn't be done. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

They will have the best of short-term justifications and nobody will say a prayer for the long-term, nobody will remember that \"good\" interference - in logic and reality - admits the possibility of bad interference as well. Try to remember Steven Gan when that moment comes. Try to remember what he, and we, have to lose. Try to remember the nature of freedom - and the times when something mustn't be done. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

He declared that both the previous interventions were \"bogus points of order\". The Speaker said that his was a \"bogus point of order\" itself.</p> <p>They are flooding into the country, along with a small minority of perfectly valid points of order whose cases will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. Soon bo gus points of order will have to be bussed to council estates in Kirkcudbright and given 75p vouchers to live on.</p> <p>Nothing whatever having been decided, we moved onto the criminal justice and police bill. Here we got a chance to clock one of the main suspects in the Mandelson GBH case, someone who was witnessed by thousands of people at the scene of the crime. Alastair Campbell knocked the helpless victim down, knife girl Clare Short slashed his face, and while a notorious Mr Big known only as \"the chancellor\" watched from the edge of the car park, vicious local thug Jack Straw repeatedly kicked him in the kidneys. This is the kind of behaviour that could cer tainly earn a fixed penalty ticket under the new law.</p> <p>Like many reformed villains, such as Mad Frankie Fraser, the home secretary has decided to recast himself as a loveable rogue, a charming scapegrace, and now part of a much-loved double act with Ann Widdecombe.</p> <p>The Tory shadow kept bouncing in her seat, like a spacehopper with an attitude problem. Every time Mr Straw produced some new misleading statistic, she emitted a shriek, or else just glowered furiously yet stoically at him, like Mrs Danvers waiting to be consumed by the flames of Mandalay. Now and again she yawned with ostentatious boredom, or else waved regally, as if the Queen Mum had formed unexpectedly strong views on the topic. He now responds in a faintly camp manner. \"I know how eager she is to get up and start ranting,\" he said, with something close to affection.</p> <p>Finally it was her turn. She announced that the bill was not too bad (which translates as \"we wouldn't dare try to get away with so much\").</p> <p>She then launched into a rant about the \"wave of violent crime swamping the country\". Labour members giggled at this hyperbole, giving her a perfect excuse to accuse them of finding violent crime \"amusing!\"</p> <p>If that's what she's like when she supports a bill, what's she like when she's against it? We already know the answer.</p>",

Dale Campbell-Savours, a Labour MP and former poacher turned game-dog, decided it was time to lick Tony Blair's face. He declared that both the previous interventions were \"bogus points of order\". The Speaker said that his was a \"bogus point of order\" itself. They are flooding into the country, along with a small minority of perfectly valid points of order whose cases will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. Soon bo gus points of order will have to be bussed to council estates in Kirkcudbright and given 75p vouchers to live on. Nothing whatever having been decided, we moved onto the criminal justice and police bill. Here we got a chance to clock one of the main suspects in the Mandelson GBH case, someone who was witnessed by thousands of people at the scene of the crime. Alastair Campbell knocked the helpless victim down, knife girl Clare Short slashed his face, and while a notorious Mr Big known only as \"the chancellor\" watched from the edge of the car park, vicious local thug Jack Straw repeatedly kicked him in the kidneys. This is the kind of behaviour that could cer tainly earn a fixed penalty ticket under the new law. Like many reformed villains, such as Mad Frankie Fraser, the home secretary has decided to recast himself as a loveable rogue, a charming scapegrace, and now part of a much-loved double act with Ann Widdecombe. The Tory shadow kept bouncing in her seat, like a spacehopper with an attitude problem. Every time Mr Straw produced some new misleading statistic, she emitted a shriek, or else just glowered furiously yet stoically at him, like Mrs Danvers waiting to be consumed by the flames of Mandalay. Now and again she yawned with ostentatious boredom, or else waved regally, as if the Queen Mum had formed unexpectedly strong views on the topic. He now responds in a faintly camp manner. \"I know how eager she is to get up and start ranting,\" he said, with something close to affection. Finally it was her turn. She announced that the bill was not too bad (which translates as \"we wouldn't dare try to get away with so much\"). She then launched into a rant about the \"wave of violent crime swamping the country\". Labour members giggled at this hyperbole, giving her a perfect excuse to accuse them of finding violent crime \"amusing!\" If that's what she's like when she supports a bill, what's she like when she's against it? We already know the answer.",

Some local government finance officials predicted last night this projection would prove optimistic. The extra central government cash in four earmarked revenue streams was agreed after Labour local government leaders warned some council tax rises would be closer to treble the rate of inflation, so threatening many Labour marginal seats. The money is on top of the provisional grant announced to councils in December and follows intense negotiations between the Treasury and the Department of Environment. The extra cash comes in the form of \u00a3100m for neighbourhood renewal in 2001-02, an extra \u00a352m for education, \u00a311.5m to cover the cost of the floods and \u00a325m for the costs of housing asylum seekers, mainly in London.

      "bodyText": "Attempts to put Augusto Pinochet on trial for alleged human rights abuses took a dramatic turn yesterday when the 85-year-old former Chilean leader was placed under house arrest for his role in 57 murders and 18 kidnappings. The criminal indictment refers to the \"Caravan of Death\", a roving helicopter hit squad that toured Chile in 1973 stopping frequently to execute and mutilate civilian prisoners - and in his decision, Judge Juan Guzman indicts Gen Pinochet for his role as author of the executions. The judge's decision is a stunning defeat for the Pinochet legal team, which had sought to have all charges dismissed based on the alleged ailments of the retired general. Not only is Gen Pinochet charged with kidnappings, but the murder charges filed againt him indicate that the self-imposed amnesty he enacted in 1978 may also be challenged by Chilean courts. Human rights activists inside the courthouse cried and hugged one another as the information was leaked to the press early yesterday morning. \"The atrocious crimes against humanity that were committed during the military dictatorship now have an intellectual author - Augusto Pinochet,\" screamed Carmen Hertz, whose husband was murdered by Pinochet security forces. \"This is a profound 'no' to the impunity that they have tried for years to impose on this country.\" \"This is a great victory for Pinochet's thousands of victims, for the rule of law and for the principle that the perpetrators of atrocities should be brought to justice,\" said Reed Brody, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch in New York. \"None of this would have happened had Pinochet not been arrested in England. That arrest broke the spell of his impunity.\" Gen Pinochet, who remained at his seaside home south-west of Santiago, issued no immediate response to the indictment. His legal team met in Santiago to study the decision and plan appeals. Chilean judges go on holiday for the month of February so the appeals could be delayed until March. Judge Guzman's first arrest of Gen Pinochet, on December 1, was overruled by a supreme court decision that the former dictator must first be questioned. After that interrogation last week, the judge as sembled further evidence to move forward with his investigation. During questioning a defiant Gen Pinochet rejected advice from his own lawyers to remain silent.

      "bodyText": "Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, has reprimanded officials in Keith Vaz's constituency Labour party for seeking to interfere in her inquiry into the minister's finances. Ms Filkin's completed report on Mr Vaz, the minister for Europe, is on the agenda for today's meeting of the select committee on standards and privileges. Ms Filkin issued her reprimand after receiving a complaint from Mustafa Kamal, a Labour councillor in the minister's Leicester East constituency. Within weeks of lodging the allegations on April 17 with Ms Filkin in the form of four detailed points about Ms Vaz's finances, Mr Kamal received a letter from the Leicester East constituency party chairman, Colin Hall. Mr Kamal was ordered within seven days to prove his claims, or face the possibility of either party disciplinary action, or even legal action. Mr Kamal was startled to receive the threat since he has insisted he only sent one letter to Ms Filkin and had himself failed to keep a copy. As a matter of course, such allegations are passed to the MP subject to the complaint by Ms Filkin. Following the warning from Mr Hall, Mr Kamal wrote to Ms Filkin, as well as the regional director of the Labour party, Roy Kennedy, and the national Labour party for its comments. Mr Kamal felt the apparent leaking of his complaint was a breach of parliamentary privilege. He subsequently received a letter from Ms Filkin reassuring him that the threatened action against him by his local party would not be proceeding. Mr Kamal also subsequently wrote to Mr Hall asking for de tails of when local party officials had decided to threaten him with disciplinary action. He also asked to know how local party officials had received a copy of his initial letter of complaint to Ms Filkin. Mr Kamal had also wanted to find out whether Mr Vaz's mother, a local party official, had been present at the meeting which decided to warn him. It is expected that Ms Filkin's inquiry has largely cleared Mr Vaz of the substantive allegations of failing to register a financial interest. However, members of the select committee are increas ingly concerned at the way in which Ms Filkin is obliged to publish almost all aspects of her inquiry, including what emerge to be inaccurate allegations. Some MPs believe it is a breach of the Human Rights Act for false allegations, or unrelated unproven allegations, to be published under the cloak of privilege. Mr Vaz is also facing separate pressure over his close relationship with the Hinduja brothers. The depth of relationship was underlined last night by the disclosure he was the billionaire brothers' guest of honour at the Millennium Dome's opening party. In return for a \u00a31m donation for the faith zone, the brothers had pressed in return for Tony Blair to sit side by side with them at a press conference to announce the sponsorship. When millennium organisers said that was impossible, the Hindujas accepted the offer of an appearance with the dome minister, Lord Falconer. Government officials who dealt with the Hindujas said the brothers always wanted to \"rub shoulders\" with prominent politicians. Tory attacks are undermined by the disclosure the party sought donations from guests after a Hinduja party in their HQ attended by William Hague on March 8, 1999, at which SP Hinduja spoke. \"I am delighted that you agreed to attend the reception at New Zealand House on March 8, 1999 at which William Hague was the guest of honour,\" wrote Jane Kenne, Conservative central office's director of income generation and marketing. She asked guests to join its treasurers club and give more than \u00a31,000 a year to fund a cultural unit in the party's HQ. The Hindujas also hired the former Home Office junior minister, Timothy Kirkhope, during 1998-99 to advise, and introduced the former Leeds Tory MP to dome staff at one meeting in New Zealand House during mid-1999 as the family's \"government relations adviser\". The solicitor yesterday said that he advised on business development, not passports, and was never an adviser on how to handle the government. \"That was not true.

      "bodyText": "The Ulster Unionist deputy leader, John Taylor, is to resign from his Westminster seat at the general election, he announced yesterday. The 63-year-old Strangford MP, who is also a Stormont assembly member, said he was stepping down because of his demanding workload. Mr Taylor, who has represented the constituency for 18 years, said however that he had no intention of retiring from politics. He was a key player in the Good Friday agreement negotiations and he has expressed his desire to increase his role at Stormont and in Northern Ireland public life. Mr Taylor is also keen to play a prominent role in the new police board. However, his resignation comes at a critical point in efforts to save the deadlocked political process and could put the UUP leader, Mr Trimble, under more pressure from hardliners in his party. A fierce battle for his Westminster seat is now likely to follow between the pro-Good Friday agreement wing of the UUP and the anti-agreement Democratic Unionist candidate, Iris Robinson. Mr Taylor, 63, had already been selected to defend Strangford. He won a comfortable 6,000 majority over the DUP in 1997. But Ian Paisley's party is promoting Mrs Robinson, a Stormont representative and the wife of deputy leader, Peter Robinson, as a strong contender. One of Mr Trimble's closest Commons allies, the Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP, Ken Maginnis, is also leaving Westminster at the election and Ulster Unionists were dealt a blow at the polls last autumn when the DUP's William McCrea defeated their candidate, David Burnside, in the South Antrim byelection. Intense talks to broker a deal between unionists, nationalists and republicans on paramilitary decommissioning are making some progress, although the new Northern Ireland secretary, John Reid, cautioned against over-optimism. Tony Blair will meet the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, in Downing Street on Wednesday and they will have to act fast if there is to be a breakthrough before election fever starts. Ulster Unionist hardliners have warned that the party could be annihilated at the polls if Mr Trimble signed up to anything short of a strong guarantee that there would be substantial IRA disarmament. Mr Taylor said last night: \"I expect the Ulster Unionists to hold the Strangford seat and I want to contribute more to the success of the Stormont assembly. This has been a very difficult decision to make but I believe it is best for the party and myself if I am to increase my political activity on other public bodies.\"",

Soon after dawn MacArthur and her 60-footer Kingfisher were just north of the equator, five miles ahead of the previous leader in the Vend\u00e9e Globe race, Michel Desjoyeaux of France, with 3,000 miles still to go. Such close running after 23,000 miles and 81 days at sea promises to make for a dramatic race to the start-and-finish line at Les Sables d'Olonne, near Nantes on the Atlantic coast of France. They are expected to arrive there on February 10, after having sailed around the Antarctic. The record comes after a remarkable fortnight of hot pur suit by the Englishwoman, who has made up 640 miles on the long-time leader Desjoyeaux since they rounded Cape Horn earlier this month. At present, MacArthur and Desjoyeaux are desperately seeking a way through the windless calms of the Doldrums in the south Atlantic, knowing that the 14-strong chasing pack is eating into what was once a huge lead. MacArthur, 5ft 2in tall and the youngest competitor in the race, is defying the punishing physical demands of continuoussailing but at the weekend she confessed she felt \"as exhausted as I ever have been in this race\". Yesterday, she was not allowing herself to get too carried away with her niche in maritime history. \"Maybe leading will feel good but I am so tired with trying to keep the boat sailing,\" she said. \"Mich and I have done 64 miles in the past 24 hours and the boats behind are doing that every five hours.\" As if to underline the stop-go dangers of the Doldrums, by midday yesterday Desjoyeaux had drifted back into the slenderest of leads.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown yesterday paved the way for full blown devolution in some English regions in a second Labour term by calling for strengthened institutions capable of breaking down Whitehall bureaucracy and creating a new provincial dynamism. The chancellor sided with Labour backbenchers and some ministers, led by John Prescott, who are pressing for a strong commitment to begin creating a network of eight regional assemblies after the election. Addressing business people in Manchester, Mr Brown, one of the architects of a Scottish parliament, outlined a gradualist approach with a strengthened role for regional chambers, comprising councillors and business interests, and a new English regional committee in the House of Commons. The government has already promised eight regional development agencies - seen as the building blocks to devolution - an extra \u00a3500m by 2003-04 bringing their annual budgets to \u00a31.7bn. With Tony Blair cooler towards English devolution, Mr Prescott has appeared a lone voice in the cabinet calling for a new tier of English democracy to match devolution in Scotland, Wales and Greater London. Now the chancellor is backing the call for a strong commitment in Labour's forthcoming manifesto for a series of referendums to test the case for constitutional change. Outlining his new enthusiasm for English devolution and a rapidly evolving constitution, Mr Brown spoke of the UK becoming a \"Britain of regions and nations with a new dynamism\". He added: \"We are moving from the old Britain of subjects where people had to look upwards to a Whitehall bureaucracy for their solutions, to a Britain of citizens where, region to region ... we are ourselves in charge.\" The Tories were unimpressed.

The rate sensitive banking sector was chased higher as investors anticipated a reduction of at least 25 basis points from the Fed. </p> <p>Tech stocks followed the fortunes of the Nasdaq composite index in New York and the recent outperformers were hit by profit-taking. </p> <p>The upshot of it all was that the FTSE 100 index ended the day 22.7 points higher at 6,317 - a seven-week closing high - thanks to strength in compa nies such as <strong>Barclays</strong>, 67p better at \u00a322.44, and <strong> Abbey National</strong>, 19p stronger at \u00a312.29p. </p> <p>A good showing from the telecommunications heavyweight, <strong> BT</strong> - up 23p to 692p after admitting it might demerge its Yellow Pages division, Yell - also helped the cause. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the FTSE Techmark 100 ended the day in much the same position as the Nasdaq composite shortly after the start of business in New York - that is, little changed, up just 2.67 points to 2,782.93. </p> <p>Market turnover was pitiful, just topping 1.5bn by 6.15pm - compared to post-Christmas volumes of over 2bn. Traders said the City's big institutions were refusing to commit fresh money to the market ahead of the Fed meeting. </p> <p> <strong> Psion</strong> was one of the day's biggest losers, falling 51p, or 9.32%, to 213p after the US electronics group Motorola pulled the plug on a product development deal. </p> <p>The FTSE 100's wooden spoon went to mining group <strong> Billiton</strong>, which lost 15.75p to 289.75p after stockbroker Merrill Lynch advised clients to take some \"quick profits\" following what it called recent \"strong outperformance\". </p> <p>Before yesterday's decline, Billiton had risen 18% since the start of the year. A downgrade from ING Charterhouse left <strong> Lattice</strong> 6p weaker at 134p. Citing concerns about gas regulator Ofgem's forthcoming review, ING lowered its investment rating on the gas network operator to \"reduce\" from \"hold\". </p> <p>Ofgem's next price review consultation paper is due out at the end of February, and traders expect it to contain details of an alternative approach to setting Transco's regulatory asset value. Put simply, Transco's regulatory asset value is the figure that dictates how much money Lattice can make and a reduced rate, which will mean lower profits for Lattice, is said to be under consideration. </p> <p>Jitters ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures got the better of chip designer <strong> ARM Holdings</strong>, down 18p to 515p, while engineering group <strong> GKN</strong> slid 22p to 821p, unsettled by unconfirmed reports that its highly rated chief executive CK Chow might step down as part of its restructuring plan. </p> <p>On the speculative front things were pretty quiet. </p> <p>A few brave punters decided to short telecoms group <strong> Thus</strong>, off 4p to 62p, ahead of its third quarter figures today, while others were having a nibble at <strong> Alliance &amp; Leicester</strong>, up 14p to 714p, on the back of reports that National Australia Bank is casting its eye over the mortgage bank. </p> <p>Elsewhere, drinks group <strong> Allied Domecq</strong> ended 19p stronger at 421p after confounding the sceptics with an upbeat trading statement. </p> <p>Among second line companies, holders of shares in frozen food retailer <strong> Iceland</strong>, 12p weaker at 192.5p, had to endure more pain. </p> <p>Its new chief executive, Bill Grimsey, is expected to deliver a report on the integration of cash and carry group Booker tomorrow, and many feel it will make grim reading. </p> <p>Fears are growing that the \u00a320m of benefits promised at the time of the deal last year are taking longer than expected to come through. </p> <p>On AIM, hi-tech fund <strong> Eurovestech</strong> ended 0.5p higher at 23.5p after announcing solid interim figures.</p>",

The upshot of it all was that the FTSE 100 index ended the day 22.7 points higher at 6,317 - a seven-week closing high - thanks to strength in compa nies such as Barclays, 67p better at \u00a322.44, and Abbey National, 19p stronger at \u00a312.29p. A good showing from the telecommunications heavyweight, BT - up 23p to 692p after admitting it might demerge its Yellow Pages division, Yell - also helped the cause. Meanwhile, the FTSE Techmark 100 ended the day in much the same position as the Nasdaq composite shortly after the start of business in New York - that is, little changed, up just 2.67 points to 2,782.93. Market turnover was pitiful, just topping 1.5bn by 6.15pm - compared to post-Christmas volumes of over 2bn. Traders said the City's big institutions were refusing to commit fresh money to the market ahead of the Fed meeting. Psion was one of the day's biggest losers, falling 51p, or 9.32%, to 213p after the US electronics group Motorola pulled the plug on a product development deal. The FTSE 100's wooden spoon went to mining group Billiton, which lost 15.75p to 289.75p after stockbroker Merrill Lynch advised clients to take some \"quick profits\" following what it called recent \"strong outperformance\". Before yesterday's decline, Billiton had risen 18% since the start of the year. A downgrade from ING Charterhouse left Lattice 6p weaker at 134p. Citing concerns about gas regulator Ofgem's forthcoming review, ING lowered its investment rating on the gas network operator to \"reduce\" from \"hold\". Ofgem's next price review consultation paper is due out at the end of February, and traders expect it to contain details of an alternative approach to setting Transco's regulatory asset value. Put simply, Transco's regulatory asset value is the figure that dictates how much money Lattice can make and a reduced rate, which will mean lower profits for Lattice, is said to be under consideration. Jitters ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures got the better of chip designer ARM Holdings, down 18p to 515p, while engineering group GKN slid 22p to 821p, unsettled by unconfirmed reports that its highly rated chief executive CK Chow might step down as part of its restructuring plan. On the speculative front things were pretty quiet. A few brave punters decided to short telecoms group Thus, off 4p to 62p, ahead of its third quarter figures today, while others were having a nibble at Alliance &amp; Leicester, up 14p to 714p, on the back of reports that National Australia Bank is casting its eye over the mortgage bank. Elsewhere, drinks group Allied Domecq ended 19p stronger at 421p after confounding the sceptics with an upbeat trading statement. Among second line companies, holders of shares in frozen food retailer Iceland, 12p weaker at 192.5p, had to endure more pain. Its new chief executive, Bill Grimsey, is expected to deliver a report on the integration of cash and carry group Booker tomorrow, and many feel it will make grim reading. Fears are growing that the \u00a320m of benefits promised at the time of the deal last year are taking longer than expected to come through. On AIM, hi-tech fund Eurovestech ended 0.5p higher at 23.5p after announcing solid interim figures.",

      "bodyText": "DaimlerChrysler, the troubled car group, is to cut 26,000 jobs over the next three years - 20% of its total US workforce - in an attempt to improve its ailing Chrysler division. Two thirds of the dismissals, which will include compulsory redundancies as well as early retirement, will come into force before the end of this year. Dieter Zetsche, the German executive brought in to restructure the American division last year, said that Chrysler's very survival depended on the rescue plan. Chrysler has previously struggled to avoid bankruptcy in 1980 and the early 1990s. The cuts were necessary to turn the loss making company around. \"To be truly competitive in today's auto industry environment, we need to be a more nimble company,\" he said. The financial impact of the cuts is to be announced next month with the Stuttgart-based company's quarterly results. Analysts expect the world's third largest car company to report a loss of some $1.25bn in the fourth quarter, largely because of the problems in the US. Performance at the once profitable Chrysler has declined sharply since it merged with Germany's Daimler-Benz in 1998 following management upheavals and fierce competition. At the time of the unprecedented $36bn deal, J\u00fcrgen Schrempp, Daimler's chief executive, described the partnership as a \"marriage made in heaven\". But its performance has not matched the company's expectations. It had assumed growth in prices and sales which never came, and also had to spend millions of dollare on sales incentives. On top of that there were production problems with its new PT Cruiser model. Analysts said Daimler and Chrysler have been reluctant to share parts to cut costs, but this may now change. Yesterday, Mr Schrempp expressed his confidence in the new German leadership of the US division and said: \"These measures will help substantially to turn around the Chrysler unit.\" The latest sign of restructuring failed to cheer investors, however. Shares in the company edged up only slightly in Germany and fell in New York after reaching a four year low last month. Arndt Ellinghorst, an analyst at WestLB Panmure, described the job cuts as \"a necessary step\" but said \"they're not out of the woods yet\". Many Wall Street analysts were particuarly concerned about the as yet unquantified cost of the restructuring. Some believe DaimlerChrysler could end with a one-off charge of between $2bn-$3bn to pay for the redundancies and other changes. The company has indicated that it expects to make a loss for the whole of 2001. Yesterday's job losses had been on the cards since the company announced a significant restructuring last November following the departure of many former Chrysler executives. As part of the restructuring, six manufacturing plants in the US will fall idle before the end of 2002. In an earlier move, the German company ordered its suppliers to cut prices by 5% from the beginning of this year, a move which is being vehemently opposed. The problems have led to suggestions that the group could face attempts to break it up. Leading manufacturers such as General Motors are said to be interested in parts of the business if Mr Schrempp's programme fails. Ford, Honda and Volkswagen would also be keen to pick over any DaimlerChrysler assets that were on the market.",

Diana Green, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, told MPs on the House of Commons education committee that the number of students dropping out of university because of debt is increasing every year.

The independent childcare commission - set up to advise the government - suggested that increased child benefit or a \"toddler tax credit\" should be offered to all but the highest earners to enable them to pay for childcare, or to ensure they could afford to stay at home. The report is being scrutinised by the Treasury. While the commission - chaired by the former social security secretary, Harriet Harman, - failed to come up with a recommended figure, family groups believe it should be at least \u00a3150, nearly half women's average weekly income of \u00a3337.

Employers should be offered tax breaks to encourage, rather than deter, them from improving childcare provision. They should also do more to improve flexibility for parents. But the commission stopped short of calling for legislation to make employers responsible for the provision or payment of childcare, and failed to suggest parents who remain at home for three years should have their jobs kept open. The commission, whose 12-month research covered parents, children and employers across the country, also proposes a government department of work and family services to drive through childcare policy.

The cream of the Canadian literary establishment made speeches in defence of freedom of expression and gave readings in the capital, Ottawa, at the weekend as the grateful teenager, wearing a pink panther tie, gloried in their attention and support. The case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre after the boy, who is still a juvenile and cannot be named under Canadian law, was thrown in jail for writing a short story called Twisted, about a young man seeking revenge for the cruelty he had endured at the hands of his classmates. His lawyer, Frank Horn, said the boy was taken into custody shortly after reading it aloud in drama class. But in the weeks since his release, it has become clear that he may be charged with more than simply writing a story with a violent ending. Many of the authors at the rally were careful to say they did not know the full story of his detention. The court banned publication of the details of his arrest and the charges against him. He has been charged with four counts of uttering death threats, only one of which is related to his short story. His younger brother was also in jail for several weeks over Christmas, accused of threatening to blow up two schools. The writers have been criticised by the local teacher's union for turning the youth into a poster boy for free speech without knowing the facts. The readings, poems and speeches, though, seemed to be intended to show support for a troubled young man rather than to turn him into a hero. \"Childhood can be hell,\" Ms Atwood said, opening the rally. \"One reason childhood can be hell is that as a child you can have no power, you can have no recourse and nobody who will actually believe you if you did go so far as to express, in one way or another, something that happened to you,\" she said, quoting from The Untouched Key, a book by the psychologist Alice Miller. Ms Atwood, who won the Booker Prize last year for her 10th novel, The Blind Assassin, presented the young man with First Words, a collection of early writings by authors who went on to become famous. Michael Ondaatje, author of The English Patient and Anil's Ghost, told the audience that writing about strong emotions such as anger could be therapeutic. \"I see myself as someone who has been saved by writing,\" he said. \"God knows what I would have been, become or how I would have ended up without it.\" The boy, who lives near Cornwall, in south-eastern Ontario, said the rally was one of the best moments of his life.

      "body": "<p> Peter Barber, who runs the British Museum's map collection, offers a series of insights into <strong> The Secrets Of Maps</strong> (9.30am, Radio 4). His opening example comes from 1564, when the first really accurate map of Britain appeared. Gerard Mercator, ace cartographer of the period, denied responsibility and attributed it to \"a friend\". Though the map was hazy about Henry VIII's new ecclesiastical boundaries, it showed Britain's coastal areas in remarkable detail. There's a strong suspicion it was designed to help a planned Spanish invasion. </p> <p>Julian O'Halloran looks at the environmental record of British farmers in <strong> File On 4</strong> (8.0pm, Radio 4). Most current rows swirl around genetically modified crops. However, this programme deals with a far longer record of failing to safeguard our countryside and its resident wildlife. For decades both the government and the agricultural industry have ignored a series of European environmental initiatives. The inevitable consequence is that our farmers are now among the nation's worst polluters. </p> <p>The <strong> Radio 1 Rock Show</strong> (12 midnight, Radio 1) features live music from Marilyn Manson (pictured). When he started his band in 1989 it was with the declared intention of affronting the bourgeoisie. His bizarre outfits and offensive stage antics saw him succeed beyond his wildest dreams. But the act doesn't come across quite as dramatically on unadorned sound waves.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Barber, who runs the British Museum's map collection, offers a series of insights into The Secrets Of Maps (9.30am, Radio 4). His opening example comes from 1564, when the first really accurate map of Britain appeared. Gerard Mercator, ace cartographer of the period, denied responsibility and attributed it to \"a friend\". Though the map was hazy about Henry VIII's new ecclesiastical boundaries, it showed Britain's coastal areas in remarkable detail. There's a strong suspicion it was designed to help a planned Spanish invasion. Julian O'Halloran looks at the environmental record of British farmers in File On 4 (8.0pm, Radio 4). Most current rows swirl around genetically modified crops. However, this programme deals with a far longer record of failing to safeguard our countryside and its resident wildlife. For decades both the government and the agricultural industry have ignored a series of European environmental initiatives. The inevitable consequence is that our farmers are now among the nation's worst polluters. The Radio 1 Rock Show (12 midnight, Radio 1) features live music from Marilyn Manson (pictured). When he started his band in 1989 it was with the declared intention of affronting the bourgeoisie. His bizarre outfits and offensive stage antics saw him succeed beyond his wildest dreams. But the act doesn't come across quite as dramatically on unadorned sound waves.",

      "body": "<p>In politics it may be naive to talk about the rules of natural justice. Politics is a trade where reality is often defined by forces that have no logic, no reason and no justice whatever. Hundreds of ministers reach the end of the road without a chance to testify in their own defence before being pushed over the cliff. Peter Mandelson, in particular, can hardly expect much sympathy if he forgets that this has always been so. Many a reputation has been terminally damaged by his whispers.</p> <p>It's also true that a party and government which he instructed in the mysteries of spin has often seemed, under his hand, the acme of evasiveness. That he should be caught out in an apparently terminal evasion is too sweet to miss. If Geoff Hoon had made the call to Mike O'Brien, who would even have asked a question? Having been evasive once before, in the Robinson affair, didn't Mandelson sacrifice a portion of the presumption of innocence? The rejoicing over his end is coloured with the unmistakable sense that you don't need to look closely at these events to know that he deserved it.</p> <p>Yet I think it's troubling. Unless you take the view that politics is so rough a trade that natural justice should bother only blithering ninnies, especially when the victim of injustice is a high-octane politician with an explosive capacity for self-destruction, the Mandelson case must be reckoned an iniquitous misfortune. The story reveals not so much a decisive prime minister as an inner court in total panic - led in that direction not by Tony Blair but Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>After all, what happened? Mandelson gave an answer to the Observer the weekend before last about his role in the Hinduja passport matter which did not tell the whole truth. He did not lie, but said his private office had been in touch with their oppos in the Home Office. It was only when Campbell told journalists on Monday that Mandelson had had no personal involvement whatever - a statement the minister had never made, either publicly or privately - that the world was substantively misled.</p> <p>This stark claim was then followed by an equally stark contradiction, again through Campbell, to the effect that Mandelson had, after all, personally called O'Brien, the passport minister, a confession that carried the insinuation - in the eyes of a voracious media - that this was a passports-for-cash affair which Mandelson had been trying to cover up. This, again, strikes me as misleading. It is apparent that both accounts - the story of private office contacts as well as the story of a Mandelson-O'Brien call - are true, and until the content of these calls is known it is impossible to say which, if either, brought any improper influence to bear on O'Brien.</p> <p>Since the fact of the personal contact between Mandelson and O'Brien was likely to be revealed anyway, via a parliamentary answer, it is hard to read an automatically sinister purpose into the half-truth Mandelson told. However, panic was by Monday evening setting in, and the epicentre of it was Campbell and his symbiotic relationship with the media: the media's appetites, their suspicion of Mandelson, their love of the kill, his fear of that, his fear of imminent self-contradiction, his own ready indulgence in the black-and-white clarities which is the only way the tabloid press reports the most subtle of political events.</p> <p>Blair, I learn, did not favour the first story being changed. He thought an urgent inquiry into what he regarded as a stupid mess was the way forward. He also did not favour Mandelson going on television on Tuesday night, straight from several hours' wrangling with Northern Ireland politicians, and inadequately briefed on what the Home Office was saying about his call to O'Brien, or any other considered line to take. The call to do those interviews was Campbell's. At 10 minutes' notice, Mandelson did three of them, his jumbled syntax only adding to the confusion and, even more, to the public impression that he was being thoroughly evasive.</p> <p>What had been created, in short, was an appalling muddle. The nuanced truth was replaced by contradictory starkness. No serious attempt was made to find out from Mandelson's officials their version of the events that the Home Office was determined to depict as keeping Jack Straw's and Mike O'Brien's faces clean. In the course of Straw's rush, quite properly, to own up to the Mandelson-O'Brien call being made, decisive importance was attached to it which closer investigation might have discovered - may still discover, through the Hammond inquiry - it did not merit.</p> <p>The response to this muddle, however, was brutally decisive. Fear overcame justice to an extent which, even in rough old politics, has few precedents and, as far as the outcome was concerned, none that I can recall. Blair saw Mandelson, told him that the Home Office papers were evidence enough, and demanded his resignation. Campbell fluttered in and out, saying that the lobby journalists, awaiting their victim, could be delayed no longer. Lord Chancellor Irvine was called in, to give the execution his blessing, which he did without demur, and the verdict was pronounced.</p> <p>Had any other minister been involved in this - see Keith Vaz - the entire effort of Blair and Campbell would have been to await the Hammond inquiry. It is a time-honoured device, and, where the facts are confused, a legitimate one. The inquiry might have concluded that Mandelson was indeed at fault. It may still discover that the minister for the dome was making offers and/or applying improper pressures. But at least all relevant witnesses would have been heard. The government would have been spared the twin embarrassment it now faces: both the destruction of one of its most prominent ministers and the evidence that it itself behaved with peremptory injustice.</p> <p>Its answer will be political. We are close to an election, it will say, and can't afford to see this saga run on indefinitely. Peter is trouble, he is anyway \"detached\", he may even - the implication disgracefully runs - have slightly lost his marbles. Campbell also suggests that Mandelson was drifting from the centre of things, a quite laughable proposition to any official who is aware of the innumerable phone calls that have passed between Mandelson and Blair every week of every month, up to and including this one.</p> <p>It's understandable, things having got to where they were last Wednesday, that this view was taken. But they didn't need to get that far. I think we should be fully aware that excessive respect for media passions was responsible for the importunate way in which the uninvestigated subtleties of this essentially minor affair were swept aside. This was due to the personality of Mandelson, a man who has attracted to himself a notoriety that makes him hated as well as perpetually suspected. Such reverence for the headlines is also, of course, an instinct dinned into New Labour by none other than P Mandelson. But the fact remains that he has been ruined, by a leader and his henchman, with other ministers gathering round, who needed his corpse more than they needed the truth.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/\">Peter Mandelson</a><br><br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430550,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: The Mandelson row - inside New Labour</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,430305,00.html\">29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430253,00.html\">29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3322\">26.1.2001: Lobby press briefing on Vaz/Mandelson - 10 Downing Street</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "In politics it may be naive to talk about the rules of natural justice. Politics is a trade where reality is often defined by forces that have no logic, no reason and no justice whatever. Hundreds of ministers reach the end of the road without a chance to testify in their own defence before being pushed over the cliff. Peter Mandelson, in particular, can hardly expect much sympathy if he forgets that this has always been so. Many a reputation has been terminally damaged by his whispers. It's also true that a party and government which he instructed in the mysteries of spin has often seemed, under his hand, the acme of evasiveness. That he should be caught out in an apparently terminal evasion is too sweet to miss. If Geoff Hoon had made the call to Mike O'Brien, who would even have asked a question? Having been evasive once before, in the Robinson affair, didn't Mandelson sacrifice a portion of the presumption of innocence? The rejoicing over his end is coloured with the unmistakable sense that you don't need to look closely at these events to know that he deserved it. Yet I think it's troubling. Unless you take the view that politics is so rough a trade that natural justice should bother only blithering ninnies, especially when the victim of injustice is a high-octane politician with an explosive capacity for self-destruction, the Mandelson case must be reckoned an iniquitous misfortune. The story reveals not so much a decisive prime minister as an inner court in total panic - led in that direction not by Tony Blair but Alastair Campbell. After all, what happened? Mandelson gave an answer to the Observer the weekend before last about his role in the Hinduja passport matter which did not tell the whole truth. He did not lie, but said his private office had been in touch with their oppos in the Home Office. It was only when Campbell told journalists on Monday that Mandelson had had no personal involvement whatever - a statement the minister had never made, either publicly or privately - that the world was substantively misled. This stark claim was then followed by an equally stark contradiction, again through Campbell, to the effect that Mandelson had, after all, personally called O'Brien, the passport minister, a confession that carried the insinuation - in the eyes of a voracious media - that this was a passports-for-cash affair which Mandelson had been trying to cover up. This, again, strikes me as misleading. It is apparent that both accounts - the story of private office contacts as well as the story of a Mandelson-O'Brien call - are true, and until the content of these calls is known it is impossible to say which, if either, brought any improper influence to bear on O'Brien. Since the fact of the personal contact between Mandelson and O'Brien was likely to be revealed anyway, via a parliamentary answer, it is hard to read an automatically sinister purpose into the half-truth Mandelson told. However, panic was by Monday evening setting in, and the epicentre of it was Campbell and his symbiotic relationship with the media: the media's appetites, their suspicion of Mandelson, their love of the kill, his fear of that, his fear of imminent self-contradiction, his own ready indulgence in the black-and-white clarities which is the only way the tabloid press reports the most subtle of political events. Blair, I learn, did not favour the first story being changed. He thought an urgent inquiry into what he regarded as a stupid mess was the way forward. He also did not favour Mandelson going on television on Tuesday night, straight from several hours' wrangling with Northern Ireland politicians, and inadequately briefed on what the Home Office was saying about his call to O'Brien, or any other considered line to take. The call to do those interviews was Campbell's. At 10 minutes' notice, Mandelson did three of them, his jumbled syntax only adding to the confusion and, even more, to the public impression that he was being thoroughly evasive. What had been created, in short, was an appalling muddle. The nuanced truth was replaced by contradictory starkness. No serious attempt was made to find out from Mandelson's officials their version of the events that the Home Office was determined to depict as keeping Jack Straw's and Mike O'Brien's faces clean. In the course of Straw's rush, quite properly, to own up to the Mandelson-O'Brien call being made, decisive importance was attached to it which closer investigation might have discovered - may still discover, through the Hammond inquiry - it did not merit. The response to this muddle, however, was brutally decisive. Fear overcame justice to an extent which, even in rough old politics, has few precedents and, as far as the outcome was concerned, none that I can recall. Blair saw Mandelson, told him that the Home Office papers were evidence enough, and demanded his resignation. Campbell fluttered in and out, saying that the lobby journalists, awaiting their victim, could be delayed no longer. Lord Chancellor Irvine was called in, to give the execution his blessing, which he did without demur, and the verdict was pronounced. Had any other minister been involved in this - see Keith Vaz - the entire effort of Blair and Campbell would have been to await the Hammond inquiry. It is a time-honoured device, and, where the facts are confused, a legitimate one. The inquiry might have concluded that Mandelson was indeed at fault.

It was actually on the college site where I was to start teaching. Usually we have a park and run scheme, which means leaving the car on a patch of wasteland and dashing for the shuttle bus that connects the college sites all over town. </p> <p>The bus is driven by Brian, a retired physical education lecturer who must have spent the better part of his teaching career moaning at students for forgetting bits of their kit as he drove them to away fixtures. Now Brian gets his kicks by putting the shuttle bus into spaces tighter than the principal's staffing budget. </p> <p>But I missed all that yesterday morning. I had found the one unreserved parking bay outside the administration building. I parked next to Murray Whelk's new Audi, tossed my Hillman Imp key fob nonchalantly into the air and entered the building in a state of curious calm. </p> <p>I was early. I was able to saunter along the corridors. I can't remember the last time I did any sauntering on the college premises. I stopped to read a notice or two and then bumped into my mate Colin from maths. </p> <p>\"Hello,\" he said cheerily. It was at this moment that I began to suspect that things were not right. </p> <p>\"How are you?\" I inquired before I could stop myself. </p> <p>\"Good news. It's arrived.\" He had a glint in his eyes. \"My new trundle wheel.\" Colin rattled off its features. I heard the words \"digital\", \"self-cleaning\" and \"envy\" several times before I left him in personal elation as he wandered the corridors only too willing to share his news with those too slow to avoid eye contact. </p> <p>I found myself with 10 minutes to do some lesson preparation, but I decided that this would spoil that freshness of delivery for which I am sure I am admired by my students. </p> <p>I got to the classroom early. I made another attempt to clean the whiteboard. The previous week an evening class lecturer in English language had used the wrong sort of pen. It would be at least a fortnight before someone came to clean away a list of anal synonyms. My class had got used to me trying to write the key themes in Hamlet in the spaces between \"hole\" and \"butt\" and the like. </p> <p>I had a good lesson. Everyone turned up and handed in their assignments, including Roxanne. This was, again, another moment when I began to suspect that things were not right. I was even able to conduct a serious discussion on Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia. Hey, I was on a literary roll. </p> <p>At the end of the lesson Roxanne asked for clarification of the essay title I had written on the board. From where she was sitting it looked like: \"How far do you agree that Hamlet is a mad arse?\" Of course what I had really written was \"Is Hamlet a bum?\" And everything went well for the entire day. So it is with trepidation that I depart for college this morning. I can't believe that I can have two good days in a row.

      "body": "<p>Getting the boot is always painful. Trying to soften the blow with silly euphemisms such as \"letting go\" and \"downsizing\" only makes things worse. </p> <p>But the cruellest agony of all, according to Peter Astle, a 34-year-old former media studies lecturer and course leader at the People's College, Nottingham, is to be summarily dispensed with and no explanation given at the time, or afterwards. </p> <p>When he was called into the office of a senior manager on August 31 last year at the end of the first student enrolment week and told his employment was terminated, he says he was taken completely by surprise. </p> <p>Still reeling from shock, he asked the obvious question: why. </p> <p>\"He said to me: 'Look, we don't have to give you any reasons for this,' \" Astle recalls. </p> <p>The college insists that Astle did know why he would not get any more assignments. But Astle says that he repeatedly requested at the time, and subsequently, an explanation and has been told nothing and has had no chance to appeal. </p> <p>He recalls: \"I said to him: I don't understand, we've just had our best media studies results ever.\" </p> <p>His students, he claims, were the first ever at the college to have gained their intermediate GNVQs in media studies. </p> <p>\"I said: 'why did you ask me back to help with enrolments.' He said: 'we don't have to talk about this.' \" </p> <p>Since then Astle says he has repeatedly written to the college seeking an explanation. </p> <p>The gist of any skimpy replies he has had back, he says, is that the college simply doesn't have to tell him. </p> <p>What has happened to him stands as a warning, he reckons, to thousands of further education lecturers in the same position - the thousands who get work in colleges via ELS, the Nottingham-based firm and biggest lecturing agency in the country. </p> <p>In despair, Astle asked ELS why his 31 teaching hours a week and his job as course leader had been summarily axed by the People's College. The agency proved as unforthcoming as he says the college was. </p> <p>\"You are a self-employed contractor and are not employed by ELS or the college,\" Rachel Newman, ELS's operations manager told him by letter. \"Therefore your references in respect of your ELS contract to 'dismissal' and your expectation of a college 'explanation' are not appropriate . . .\" </p> <p>Astle has been devastated. \"It is a disgusting way to treat any individual and no college or agency should be allowed to get away with it. </p> <p>\"The effect is disastrous. How on earth can you get another job when your last employers sack you and refuse to give any reasons for their actions?\" </p> <p>He was asked to interview for a media studies teaching job by another college. \"I couldn't go through with it because I was so depressed. This has affected my mental health.\" </p> <p>The way he tells it, his situation sounds like a Kafka plot. The one thing Astle is clear about is that it is an abuse against him. If so, it is an abuse which the government could quite easily prevent happening to others. And it wouldn't need new legislation. </p> <p>That was made clear at a conference of trade union lawyers in London yesterday. Simon Deakin, reader in economic law at Cambridge University, told the gathering that it had not yet caught the public attention that the Employment Relations Act 1999 gives government the power to confer rights on individuals who fall within a grey area of neither being employees nor self-employed. Whether the government is ready to use this power is another matter. </p> <p>Astle was originally invited by a contact at the college to help with some teaching on a course. He was then told that he would have to come to the college via ELS. </p> <p>A recent survey by the lecturers' union, Natfhe at the college reported that 81% of ELS staff there either found their own work or were offered work by People's College before being referred to the agency. </p> <p>Astle says his hours were increased to 31.5 classroom teaching hours a week and he was made course leader in June 1999. In February last year he says he led a five-day trip of 18 students to Futuroscope, the multi-media park in France. </p> <p>Astle willingly admits that he had no teaching qualification and little teaching experience. His background was as a practitioner in media. He had set up a university radio station and had worked in recording studios. </p> <p>He found that he enjoyed teaching at People's College and decided to embark on a teaching qualification. He says that he was told he would continue teaching for the 2000/01 academic year. </p> <p>The college principal, John Rudd, said that he uses agencies for all sorts of staff. About 120 lecturers a year are hired via ELS. Rudd said that it wasn't normal to explain to agency staff why they wouldn't be wanted again. </p> <p>\"If it was a temp in the office you might phone Office Angels and say: You send somebody else. </p> <p>But because Peter was a teacher at the college for a period of time, that's the reason why it was explained to him personally.\" </p> <p>He rejected Astle's assertion that nobody would tell him why he had been rejected. </p> <p>\"He wasn't dismissed. His assignment with the college had ended.\" </p> <p>He asserts that Astle knew why he wasn't wanted for the new autumn term. The reasons \"were to do with quality and they were to do with general management and performance which he showed when he was assigned to teach this course. </p> <p>\"In respect of that course the college received a damning report, in effect on the work of Peter Astle. If the college had not done an awful lot of work after the course had finished the students would have failed.\" </p> <p>If Astle proved so deficient, why hadn't the college or ELS picked it up over 18 months? </p> <p>Rudd said: \"We've tightened up procedures with ELS staff.

      "bodyText": "Getting the boot is always painful. Trying to soften the blow with silly euphemisms such as \"letting go\" and \"downsizing\" only makes things worse. But the cruellest agony of all, according to Peter Astle, a 34-year-old former media studies lecturer and course leader at the People's College, Nottingham, is to be summarily dispensed with and no explanation given at the time, or afterwards. When he was called into the office of a senior manager on August 31 last year at the end of the first student enrolment week and told his employment was terminated, he says he was taken completely by surprise. Still reeling from shock, he asked the obvious question: why. \"He said to me: 'Look, we don't have to give you any reasons for this,' \" Astle recalls. The college insists that Astle did know why he would not get any more assignments. But Astle says that he repeatedly requested at the time, and subsequently, an explanation and has been told nothing and has had no chance to appeal. He recalls: \"I said to him: I don't understand, we've just had our best media studies results ever.\" His students, he claims, were the first ever at the college to have gained their intermediate GNVQs in media studies. \"I said: 'why did you ask me back to help with enrolments.' He said: 'we don't have to talk about this.' \" Since then Astle says he has repeatedly written to the college seeking an explanation. The gist of any skimpy replies he has had back, he says, is that the college simply doesn't have to tell him. What has happened to him stands as a warning, he reckons, to thousands of further education lecturers in the same position - the thousands who get work in colleges via ELS, the Nottingham-based firm and biggest lecturing agency in the country. In despair, Astle asked ELS why his 31 teaching hours a week and his job as course leader had been summarily axed by the People's College. The agency proved as unforthcoming as he says the college was. \"You are a self-employed contractor and are not employed by ELS or the college,\" Rachel Newman, ELS's operations manager told him by letter. \"Therefore your references in respect of your ELS contract to 'dismissal' and your expectation of a college 'explanation' are not appropriate . . .\" Astle has been devastated. \"It is a disgusting way to treat any individual and no college or agency should be allowed to get away with it. \"The effect is disastrous. How on earth can you get another job when your last employers sack you and refuse to give any reasons for their actions?\" He was asked to interview for a media studies teaching job by another college. \"I couldn't go through with it because I was so depressed. This has affected my mental health.\" The way he tells it, his situation sounds like a Kafka plot. The one thing Astle is clear about is that it is an abuse against him. If so, it is an abuse which the government could quite easily prevent happening to others. And it wouldn't need new legislation. That was made clear at a conference of trade union lawyers in London yesterday. Simon Deakin, reader in economic law at Cambridge University, told the gathering that it had not yet caught the public attention that the Employment Relations Act 1999 gives government the power to confer rights on individuals who fall within a grey area of neither being employees nor self-employed. Whether the government is ready to use this power is another matter. Astle was originally invited by a contact at the college to help with some teaching on a course. He was then told that he would have to come to the college via ELS. A recent survey by the lecturers' union, Natfhe at the college reported that 81% of ELS staff there either found their own work or were offered work by People's College before being referred to the agency. Astle says his hours were increased to 31.5 classroom teaching hours a week and he was made course leader in June 1999. In February last year he says he led a five-day trip of 18 students to Futuroscope, the multi-media park in France. Astle willingly admits that he had no teaching qualification and little teaching experience. His background was as a practitioner in media. He had set up a university radio station and had worked in recording studios. He found that he enjoyed teaching at People's College and decided to embark on a teaching qualification. He says that he was told he would continue teaching for the 2000/01 academic year. The college principal, John Rudd, said that he uses agencies for all sorts of staff. About 120 lecturers a year are hired via ELS. Rudd said that it wasn't normal to explain to agency staff why they wouldn't be wanted again. \"If it was a temp in the office you might phone Office Angels and say: You send somebody else. But because Peter was a teacher at the college for a period of time, that's the reason why it was explained to him personally.\" He rejected Astle's assertion that nobody would tell him why he had been rejected. \"He wasn't dismissed. His assignment with the college had ended.\" He asserts that Astle knew why he wasn't wanted for the new autumn term. The reasons \"were to do with quality and they were to do with general management and performance which he showed when he was assigned to teach this course. \"In respect of that course the college received a damning report, in effect on the work of Peter Astle. If the college had not done an awful lot of work after the course had finished the students would have failed.\" If Astle proved so deficient, why hadn't the college or ELS picked it up over 18 months? Rudd said: \"We've tightened up procedures with ELS staff. It's ELS's - the agency's - responsibility to ensure that the person is doing a quality job.\" Richard Eve, ELS executive director, said: \"We would have satisfied ourselves as to whether Mr Astle is suitably qualified.\" Asked how Astle could appeal against or get an explanation for the college's summary action, Eve said there was a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" about the nature of employment of ELS lecturers. \"There's no dismissal at all because when the lecturer accepts the contract they know what the end day is.\" Eve said ELS was not obliged to discuss it with Astle. \"He's asked why he's been dismissed. His contract came up.\" Astle is still on ELS's books, Eve said. Astle himself intends to take the college to tribunal for unfair dismissal and is consulting Natfhe. On Friday he received confirmation from the Inland Revenue that he was an employee, not self employed.",

So the establishment by the Local Government Association of another examination of the scope for change - in the form of an Independent Commission on the Organisation of the School Year - was not a surprise.

Not only would that address some of the problems of the present pattern, it would open up the possibility of a post qualification admission system for entry to higher education, and ease many of the uncertainties of the present UCAS system.

Not to do so would place colleges at a disadvantage in relation to transfer at 16- plus, would make joint planning and delivery for 14- to 19-year-olds problematic, inhibit other types of partnership activity, and increase costs by making coordination of transport provision much more difficult. To do so colleges could garner many of the benefits which would accrue for schools, and would need to tackle many of the same organisational challenges. </p> <p>In addition, colleges would face some particular problems of their own.

      "body": "<p>Only around 3% of lone mothers in Britain are in full-time education. But perhaps this is not surprising. Would you risk borrowing more than your annual income to finance your higher education, and the prospect of years of debt ahead of you? </p> <p>These dilemmas face most lone parents if they want a degree to help them escape poverty and dependence on state benefits. Lone mothers are much less likely than other women to have any educational qualifications, including degrees. Their lower qualification levels help explain why they have the lowest economic activity rates of all women and why, when they do work, most are concentrated in low-skilled and low-paid jobs. </p> <p>Consequently, lone parents are particularly reliant on social security benefits either to top up their low wages or as their main source of income. Their average annual income of \u00a310,972 means that around three in five live in poverty while two thirds of children in one-parent families are poor. </p> <p>A key route out of poverty for lone parents and their children, is educational qualifications. So if the government wants to meet its commitments to widening and increasing participation in higher education, lone parents are an obvious target group. </p> <p>In our study, commissioned by the Department for Education and Employment, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of nearly 3,000 higher-education students about their income, expenditure and debt. We looked at the impact of the changes in student funding policies since 1995/6, and showed how the move from student grants to loans had led to a three-fold increase in full-time students' debt. With rising student debt, entering higher education is an increasingly risky invest ment decision for low income students. For most this risk will pay off. </p> <p>However, when lone parents do take the risk, our survey found they are the most likely to build up high levels of debt, and experience financial difficulties while studying. These affect their performance and chances of completing their course successfully. This risk of failure may discourage prospective students from less advantaged backgrounds from borrowing the large sums of money now needed to get a university degree. </p> <p>Our survey found that in 1998/9 lone parents studying full time had the highest average incomes of \u00a39,139, compared to an average of \u00a34,924 for all full-time students. Unlike other students, most of their income came from the student-support system, including student loans, and from social security benefits. Unlike other students, they could not rely ontheir family for help, or on wages from paid work. </p> <p>Lone parents' comparatively high expenditure was because they had dependent children. For example, lone parents spent an average of \u00a31,457 a year on both formal and informal childcare, nearly three times more than married/cohabiting students with children. They also incurred other extra costs because of their children. </p> <p>Our study showed that all student lone parents owed \u00a34,747 on average at the end of the 1998/9 academic year - double the average level of student debt. They had accumulated these debts because they relied heavily on student loans. They were also much more likely than others to supplement their income through commercial credit. Despite their high levels of borrowing, lone parents students had to economise the most. More seriously, 77% of lone parents felt that financial difficulties had negatively affected their academic performance, compared with 60% of all students, and they were far more likely than others to think about dropping out for financial reasons. </p> <p>The government recognises the problems faced by lone parents. It has just released details of an imaginative new package, centred on a new childcare grant. All low-income lone parents, with children up to the age of 14, will be entitled to the grant to pay for formal registered childcare. They will receive a fixed proportion of their actual childcare costs of up to maximum of \u00a3100 per week for one child, or \u00a3150 for two or more children, payable over 52 weeks. This will enable many lone parents to get paid work over the summer vacation, and so reduce their debts. </p> <p>In addition, an access bursary of \u00a3500 will be available for those not claiming the new childcare grant. This bursary recognises lone parents' particular reliance on informal childcare arrangements. It is discretionary, however, and not an entitlement like the childcare grant. In addition a new income-assessed grant of \u00a3500 is being introduced to help pay for travel, books and equipment. Together these welcome measures, and those already in place, will really help lone parents, and in the longer term may serve to contain their overall levels of debt. </p> <p>Lone parents' financial concerns do not stop once they leave university - quite the contrary. Their student-loan repayments are based on their income on graduation. However, research shows that graduate mothers not living with a partner are less likely to be employed than graduate mothers living with a partner. And even when lone parents do work after graduating, their earnings are likely to be lower than other graduates. This means it will take them longer than more affluent students to pay off their debts. </p> <p>Some of the changes this government has introduced to student financial support are very real improvements on previous policies. There is, however, a key problem with the reforms for all low-income students, not just lone parents - it's the re placement of maintenance grants with student loans. This change means that students from the lowest socio-economic groups end up with the largest debts and experience the greatest hardship, which make higher education a risky investment. </p> <p>Prospective students, especially lone parents, may be deterred from going to university because of the sheer size of the debts they will accumulate along with concerns about paying off their loans. There is a real danger that the government's desire to widen and increase participation will be undermined by this radical change to student financial support. </p> <p>In future, lone parent students will leave university with much higher debts because of the move from grants to loans. Assuming constant 2000/1 rates of student loans and an estimated commercial credit debt averaging around \u00a3700 a year, a lone parent starting university this academic year could leave three years later with a debt of over \u00a315,000. </p> <p>This is 50% more than lone parents' average annual income. Will lone parents be able to jump over this psychological barrier? Could you?<br> </p> <p>Claire Callender is professor of social policy and Martin Kemp is a researcher at South Bank University</p> <p>\u0095 The full report - Claire Callender and Martin Kemp (2000), Changing Student Finances: Income, Expenditure and the Take-up of Student Loans among Full-and Part-time Higher Education Students in 1998/9, is available from DfEE Publications Tel: 0845 60 22260, price \u00a34.95.

Two people on her course have dropped out for financial reasons, she says. She has two children - three-year old Nieema and Ajeye, one year old this week - who attend the South Bank nursery, and she finds her student loan is eaten up entirely by childcare costs. </p> <p>To make ends meet, she works part-time at a centre for homeless teenagers where she was a volunteer helper before starting her degree. </p> <p>She left school without any qualifications and started a GNVQ course in health and social care when her first child was a baby. The government's New Deal for lone parents helped with the cost of travelling to college. Going on to the degree was a natural progression, says Rachel. Although things are tough now, she believes she will be able to get a better job as a graduate to pay off her student loan and provide for her family. \"I'm enjoying the course and the children are enjoying the nursery - it keeps us busy anyway.\"</p> <p><strong>Donald MacLeod </strong></p>",

This bursary recognises lone parents' particular reliance on informal childcare arrangements. It is discretionary, however, and not an entitlement like the childcare grant. In addition a new income-assessed grant of \u00a3500 is being introduced to help pay for travel, books and equipment. Together these welcome measures, and those already in place, will really help lone parents, and in the longer term may serve to contain their overall levels of debt. Lone parents' financial concerns do not stop once they leave university - quite the contrary. Their student-loan repayments are based on their income on graduation. However, research shows that graduate mothers not living with a partner are less likely to be employed than graduate mothers living with a partner. And even when lone parents do work after graduating, their earnings are likely to be lower than other graduates. This means it will take them longer than more affluent students to pay off their debts. Some of the changes this government has introduced to student financial support are very real improvements on previous policies. There is, however, a key problem with the reforms for all low-income students, not just lone parents - it's the re placement of maintenance grants with student loans. This change means that students from the lowest socio-economic groups end up with the largest debts and experience the greatest hardship, which make higher education a risky investment. Prospective students, especially lone parents, may be deterred from going to university because of the sheer size of the debts they will accumulate along with concerns about paying off their loans. There is a real danger that the government's desire to widen and increase participation will be undermined by this radical change to student financial support. In future, lone parent students will leave university with much higher debts because of the move from grants to loans. Assuming constant 2000/1 rates of student loans and an estimated commercial credit debt averaging around \u00a3700 a year, a lone parent starting university this academic year could leave three years later with a debt of over \u00a315,000. This is 50% more than lone parents' average annual income. Will lone parents be able to jump over this psychological barrier? Could you? Claire Callender is professor of social policy and Martin Kemp is a researcher at South Bank University \u0095 The full report - Claire Callender and Martin Kemp (2000), Changing Student Finances: Income, Expenditure and the Take-up of Student Loans among Full-and Part-time Higher Education Students in 1998/9, is available from DfEE Publications Tel: 0845 60 22260, price \u00a34.95.

Hard times - but worth it, they say As someone who worked for years in accountancy, Kim Broodie knows a bad financial situation when she sees one. \"I'm used to earning money and now I don't have any,\" says the 39-year-old South Bank University student in the second year of an accountancy and finance degree. Her eldest daughter, Ayisha, is feeling the lack of money more, she laughs, but Kim says that going to university herself is inspiring her children to aim for higher education. \"I will have to work hard to get my degree before [Ayisha] goes to university.\" Kim's youngest son, Kazeem, attends the university's nursery, but there are other childcare costs and Kim believes the government's promised childcare grant will help. Rachel Hassan, 24, started her degree in social policy in September and is already finding it hard- going financially. Two people on her course have dropped out for financial reasons, she says. She has two children - three-year old Nieema and Ajeye, one year old this week - who attend the South Bank nursery, and she finds her student loan is eaten up entirely by childcare costs. To make ends meet, she works part-time at a centre for homeless teenagers where she was a volunteer helper before starting her degree. She left school without any qualifications and started a GNVQ course in health and social care when her first child was a baby. The government's New Deal for lone parents helped with the cost of travelling to college. Going on to the degree was a natural progression, says Rachel. Although things are tough now, she believes she will be able to get a better job as a graduate to pay off her student loan and provide for her family. \"I'm enjoying the course and the children are enjoying the nursery - it keeps us busy anyway.\" Donald MacLeod",

That culture is overwhelmingly white and male, and is perpetuated by the fact so many of the senior academics have little experience of other universities. </p> <p>A new report canvassing the views of the 7,000 people on the Cambridge payroll reveals that many staff feel their work is undervalued by the university and criticise the lack of management and people skills among heads of department. It highlights \"intimidation by culture rather than individual persons\". </p> <p>The report was commissioned by the university from Schneider-Ross, the equal opportunities experts. It canvassed all staff, whether cleaners or professors, to see whether they felt valued and fairly treated. </p> <p>The aim was to take stock of the current position - Schneider-Ross says Cambridge has a good range of equal opportunities policies - and identify key areas for change. </p> <p>The university is the first in this country to commission such an independent survey, and has pledged to take action on problems identified. \"We are not doing justice to the talent we have at Cambridge if we take a 'sink or swim' attitude to career development,\" said vice-chancellor Sir Alec Broers. \"I see it as vital we establish a more friendly and supportive environment for everyone.\" </p> <p>Broers said resources would be found to implement the findings of the report. He acknowledged that it identified that \"many of us with organisational responsibilities currently lack the necessary skills\". </p> <p>But he added: \"The Cambridge culture has adapted and changed in the last 10 years. We've developed a highly successful entrepreneurial culture here - we can do the same with equality and diversity issues.\" </p> <p>The report highlights the dilemma of one of the world's top universities, famous for its cutting-edge research, in its choice of managers. Many staff felt there was a conflict between the need to appoint eminent researchers able to attract vital research funds for the university and the need for people skills in running departments. </p> <p>Cambridge gets more than 30% of its income from research and has always scored high in the national research assessments. But not everyone thinks this is an unmitigated benefit. \"The Research Assessment Exercise has done more to hold back good practice in equal opportunities than any other thing,\" says one respondent. \"Management skills don't influence Cambridge's standing; it's research that does,\" said another. </p> <p>\"Nobody seems to [care] whether people can teach or not,\" a third comments. \"All that matters is how much research money you can bring in.\" </p> <p>In all, 40% of the university's staff responded to the survey and two-thirds rated Cambridge University a good employer and felt they had been fairly treated and valued by their colleagues. They rated the university a desirable place to work. </p> <p>But three-quarters of those who replied thought the university must move further towards equality of opportunity, mainly on moral grounds but also because without progress it would not be possible to attract and retain the most talented staff. </p> <p>They see the biggest hurdle as that of the \"closed\" culture which needs to change if the university is to be seen as a more inclusive institution. \"Other universities have had these things in place for years\" is a comment quoted in the survey to reflect a general view: few people (only 12%) thought that Cambridge was good at learning from other institutions. </p> <p>Schneider-Ross suggests that part of this problem could lie in the fact that 70% of the top academics (professors and readers) surveyed had a Cambridge degree, whether at the first or higher level, and nearly 40% of academics in the survey had been at the university for 20 years or more. </p> <p>A third of the academics who put forward their views and who had a Cambridge degree had no experience of other universities. The report quotes a comment that the institution is seen as \"insular and secretive - at least if you have been a student here you know the rules\". </p> <p>A reputation for excellence over the centuries, with many academics choosing to stay in the male-dominated university for most of their working lives, produces a distinctive culture which came under fire from staff, particularly those who could be seen as outsiders and who experienced feelings of exclusion. </p> <p>\"I sense that recruitment is fair. But what is not fair is the culture,\" was one comment highlighted to illustrate some of the problems. </p> <p>Not surprisingly it found that male readers and professors were the most satisfied among the staff. As a group they were seen as somewhat \"blind\" to issues of equal opportunities. </p> <p>\"It is easy for those in privileged positions to assume that they are there because of their ability,\" reported one male academic. \"Women are more aware there is an issue. Men don't think about it. It doesn't affect them,\" said one female academic. </p> <p>Among British universities, Cambridge was late in offering women full degrees, and it has long had a problem with the percentage of women academics on its staff. They currently make up just under 15% of all Cambridge academic staff: only 19 of the 302 professors are women. </p> <p>Two-thirds of female academics said they had experienced feelings of exclusion at some time, twice the percentage of male professors and readers with the same experience. </p> <p>Schneider-Ross say the culture can only be changed by leadership. The report questions whether many department heads have the necessary people-management skills ito do this. </p> <p>A third of the staff surveyed reported feeling unable to discuss the development of their career with their head of department, and nearly a quarter complained that bullying by managers had been a barrier to their career progress. </p> <p>Some heads were valued by their staff - one boss was described as a \"treasure\" - but there was much criticism of management skills overall. \"Our head has no skills in relation to managing people. That affects men as well as women,\" said one. Management training is available for heads, but attendance is voluntary and often not taken up. \"Requiring people to attend training is anathema to Cambridge. They would probably say they didn't have the time,\" one person said. </p> <p>The vice-chancellor says training must be a requirement in future. The university has already begun to introduce a scheme that will require all those involved in selection to have equal opportunities training. And such training will be given to all new managers. Schneider-Ross says ways should be agreed to hold heads of department accountable for their leadership and management skills. </p> <p>The university does not monitor the ethnic background of academic staff but draws gifted people from around the world. Schneider-Ross found a strong acceptance of national diversity and survey responses came from staff of 33 different nationalities. But of those who identified themselves as from ethnic minorities - 171 of the 3,034 re sponses - three-quarters had felt excluded from Cambridge culture at some time. </p> <p>Managing disability issues was an area of concern. Disabled staff felt most excluded, bullied and discriminated against. They felt on the whole that \"at the central level you get action on disability. At the faculty level you get little understanding. You don't get a chance to discuss it properly with your head. There is little awareness.\" </p> <p> Since the equality audit a disability resource centre has been opened and disability training begun. The remarks on disability reflect one key finding of the report, that not all heads of departments know, or act upon, central policies of the university. </p> <p>Cambridge, for instance, has family-friendly policies which allow job sharing or a career break because of family responsibilities without loss of seniority. But the report highlights the low take-up: less than one in 200 academic staff works part-time. </p> <p>\"I have thought of working part-time but I have not dared mention it to anybody,\" was one comment. </p> <p>The survey also noted a perception among academics that working part-time would be \"held against them\". </p> <p>Over a third of all staff - and nearer half the female academic staff - saw being expected to work excessively long hours as a barrier to career progress. \"They always have very big faculty meetings on a Saturday,\" commented one respondent. </p> <p>Schneider-Ross express surprise that half the academic staff surveyed had no caring responsibilities. </p> <p>Not everyone objected to long hours. \"What are excessively long hours when you love what you are doing?\" asked one. Many reported feeling valued by their closest colleagues, and many recorded the pleasure and intrinsic satisfaction they found in their work - although fewer than a third thought their work had the financial reward it justified. </p> <p>Schneider-Ross saw a failure to implement the central job-appraisal system properly, and lack of support from department heads in career progress. Nearly half those surveyed saw promotion processes as a barrier to career progression. \"You can't make head nor tail of what it takes to get an advancement,\" said one academic. </p> <p>The report identified particular problems faced by contract staff - researchers appointed for a given period for a specific project - and who now outnumber academic staff with permanent jobs. The university has now begun to appoint people with responsibility for contract staff. </p> <p>The consultants found the gulf in Cambridge University between academic and support staff reflected a national problem in higher education. Support staff reported a strong feeling of \"us and them\". \"Assistant staff and academics are like oil and water - they don't mix\" was one comment. Support staff felt they were seen as \"inferior\", even when they were well qualified graduates. </p> <p>The Cambridge colleges, employers in their own right and not included in the survey, were seen as contributing to this \"us and them\" factor. Many academics have a college membership which provides a social network - but it is a world to which support staff hardly ever have access.</p>",

Johnson Associates, the company he is MD of, switched primarily into education. \"I won't go into sectors unless there are a lot of similar businesses of reasonable size and they are under pressure to improve their performance.\" His method is to strip down every cost in a college and store it in a database which enables it to be compared against similar colleges' costs. \"We can tell a \u00a315m college, for instance, that its \u00a3400,000 telephone bill is four times more than we would normally expect.\" He would typically show a college 25 areas where its costs are out of line with norms. Johnson-Hill greatly admires the Further Education Funding Council for the unitised system. But he is suspicious of the taste for mergers which the council, soon to be disbanded, has latterly promoted. This taste was also encouraged by the education secretary David Blunkett who last year spoke of the council becoming \"proactive in encouraging mergers\" and even making merger a condition of continuing funding for colleges in serious financial straits Johnson-Hill's results show that as colleges grow from \u00a33m-budget to \u00a330m-budget size, central administration costs drop by 80 pence per unit, or 5% of total income. But at the same time teaching costs on average rise by \u00a32 per unit, or 12% of total income. \"You also have, what colleges don't see, a deterioration in the performance of direct labour, ie the front line teachers, because the management moves further and further away from them. \"All in all, the data does fly in the face of the popular theory that big is beautiful and that to merge will bring benefits of efficiency.\"",

      "bodyText": "Sue Flohr British Dyslexia Association If your daughter is going to resit her A-levels at an further education college she will probably find there is a good learning support department to help her. There should be no cost implications as the college can apply for funding to cover any extra costs in her tuition through the Education Funding Council. If your child is still at school, schools have a duty to offer as much help as possible to children with dyslexia. Another option is to pay for a private tutor - we can offer advice for people considering this, and a local dyslexia association may be able to supply the names of specialist teachers. You'll find public libraries have two reference books which may help: Grants for Individuals in Need and The Educational Grants Directory. Try also to get an exciting piece of software called Wordswork, which will help your daughter find the best way to study. When she is ready to apply for university, Dorothy Gilroy's book Applying to Higher Education for Dyslexic Students is worth a look. For more information call the BDA Helpline on 0118-966 8271. Martin Sissons Skill, the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities If your daughter is at school, she probably has a Statement of Special Educational Needs which involves support from her school. If she is at a FE college, it should meet her needs, usually by providing special facilities such as computer resources. Colleges can get extra funding for this. Your daughter is entitled to free further education until she reaches 19 (18 in Scotland). If she is older, colleges may decide to let her study without paying fees. They are likely to let her finish a course she's started, perhaps by resitting exams, and are also more likely to let her carry on free if she's progressed more slowly than usual because of learning difficulties. Problems can arise if dyslexia is suspected, but has not been identified by a full assessment, although this should be arranged by your school or college (once she's left learning she'll find little financial support for any dyslexia assessments, which cost more than \u00a3200). Many people pay for these themselves, but you may be able to go to grant-making organisations and trusts for help. If she does a degree or HND, cash help may be available from the Local Education Authority, through the Disabled Students' Allowances.

      "body": "<p>When I first walked my elder daughter through the gates of our local primary I felt something approaching awe. Here, 10 minutes from our home - eight if you run, and we are always running - is a school containing children from every social background, religion and nationality. Like so many large inner city primaries, it is housed in a formidable Victorian building: there is a large intake of refugees, not enough playground space and a chronic teacher shortage. Oh, and it is also a wonderful school. (If you don't believe me, ask Ofsted). </p> <p>But walking through those gates I also felt a primitive sense of recognition. For as a child and teenager I, too, raced to schools just minutes from my home which contained an extraordinary mix of class, nationality and religion ; 26 languages were spoken at my secondary school. </p> <p>Resources were an issue even backthen, in the pre-inflationary 70s. And then, too, the question of middle-class participation in the great state school experiment was a big deal for the pundits, politicians and policy-makers. </p> <p>But I am the product not just of a state school but a comprehensive education. It was, and remains, a crucial distinction. Comprehensives were first introduced as the answer to an insidious system that divided children up by apparent ability before they were even teenagers and consigned large sections of young people to a no-hope future, educationally speaking. In contrast, the comprehensive school opened its doors to all in the neighbourhood, the able and apparently not so able, the well off and the not so well off. In doing so, it was an important first lesson in democratic citizenship. And a comprehensive education has a particular feel to it, an openness and excitement that I can still recall more than 20 years on. </p> <p>But, as a special conference convened this week, will ask: how will the comprehensive ideal survive into the 21st century? Anxiety over the future of comprehensive schooling is particularly acute under this government, which, in its unerring support for parental choice has, many claim, accelerated the introduction of more subtle forms of selection. And in its unending search for electorally popular ideas the government continues to put forward depressingly old-new initiatives such as this week's announcement on vocational training for the 14 plus, which will once more divide children at too early an age, this time in the name of so-called technical know how. </p> <p>I did not start out in state schools. Like so many children of Labour politicians in the 60s, my brothers and I began our education in the private sector. My parents, Tony and Caroline Benn, decided to move us all to state schools around 1963 on the grounds that it was hypocritical to back comprehensives for everyone else and then educate your own children privately. In some people's eyes, this made us four children a collective sacrifice, a living social experiment. We felt only lucky. </p> <p>Our nearest comprehensive was Holland Park, which cynics so enjoyed deriding as a showcase comprehensive and therefore a place of privilege. (If I had a pound for the number of times people have said to me, \"Holland Park? Oh that wasn't a real comprehensive!\" I could have paid for a year of private schooling, easy.) Holland Park was one of the first purpose-built comprehensives in the country but it was also, by the time I got there in the late 60s, a large rumbustious institution, which drew in a small, albeit highly publicised, section of the middle class who lived around the school. Some of these, like my mother, Caroline, became passionately committed to both the school itself - she was governor of Holland Park for 35 years - and the wider comprehensive cause. </p> <p>My brother Hilary remembers the strangeness of arriving at Holland Park for the first time after attending Westminster preparatory school, where he and my eldest brother Stephen had been usefully designated as Benn I and Benn II. He can still remember how huge the school buildings looked to him and the strange sound of so many boys - and girls - laughing and running and talking in the vast playgrounds. </p> <p>It remains virtually impossible to talk about class in this country without sounding pious or sentimental. Lets just say this: class distinctions are not erased in a comprehensive. If anything they become sharper. In this sense, it is rather like the best of city living. All one learns is how to coexist and get a kick out of the proximity of so many kinds of difference. </p> <p>You will also learn useful things about yourself. For instance, should you live in a good-sized house with a garden you will understand, as my daughters are now coming to understand, just how privileged you are. I remember the surprise and an odd sense of shame I felt at my own ignorance when I saw one of my classmates, who often came to school without shoes, dropped off at school in the caravan in which she lived. Each school creates its own kind of world but a comprehensive has a better claim than most to represent the whole of the world outside, and that is an education in itself. Anyone who has been through a comprehensive wouldn't dream of trying to be a Ruler of Men, a Master of the Universe. The Universe is there, all around you, with its own volatility and vitality, its own plans. </p> <p>But what about standards? Well, there were brilliant teachers, there were teachers who could bore you into some extra curricular reading. (I first read Lucky Jim in the back of one particularly tedious sixth form course.) There were teachers who had trouble controlling classes, there were teachers who could capture your attention just in the way they entered a room. </p> <p>In some ways, it was a much less conformist, more politicised era: we wrote essays on free schools, spent a lot of time in the art room, ran school assemblies, played enthusiastically in the orchestra and like most middle class children in state schools got the requisite O-levels, A-levels and, later, degrees and further degrees. </p> <p>But as a parent, I am acutely aware of how different things are now from the 70s. For those of us who still want to live the comprehensive dream for our children it is getting much harder. Parental choice has meant the introduction of what is, in effect, hidden selection. Education, particularly in the inner cities, has come to resemble a minefield where the aim seems chiefly to negotiate your child's safe passage through the system. </p> <p>As a result, anxiety about education has reached almost fever pitch. I have been at three- year-olds' birthday parties where the parents sit, chomping crisps and swapping information about the local secondary schools with all the intensity of Pokemon obsessives. </p> <p>There obviously is a genuine dilemma here. In some boroughs the local school will amount to a sink school which does not represent the true mix of talent and type in that locality, a school which has for one reason or another lost hope. But what parents do not realise is how often this is the result of education policy, the price of parental choice, rather than the failure of one headmaster, one set of teachers or a particular local authority. This isn't personal, it's politics. </p> <p>Results in Scotland, which adopted a completely comprehensive system in the 70s, show that pupils actually thrive under such a system, which in effect removes the right of politicians to create schools for the specially gifted or create special places for special children, as New Labour plans to do. And on recent results, comprehensive Cheshire outperforms selective Kent on every achievement indicator available. </p> <p>But let's not get too gloomy. There remain many schools, even within inner cities, that we can still call more or less comprehensive. Here, pupils get good enough results which is all that exams should be about anyway; a statement of intent, a window on to the next stage of learning. Changes to the national curriculum have, to some extent, allayed middle-class anxiety about achievement. Certainly, a bright six-year-old today seems incredibly literate and numerate compared to when I was a child. </p> <p>What remains, as ever, is anxiety about social mixing. This is partly an age-old middle class fear of the underclass, partly a wish to educate one's children with other children of the same background and partly a pretty simple kind of snobbery that uses education as a way of keeping one's children separate from most ordinary children. But for that, there are always private schools. </p> <p>But in those schools that retain a genuine social mix, there exists the same kind of excitement that I remember from my school days. I see something of the same spirit in the teenagers I know at these schools; a lack of fear, an absence of arrogance, a genuine openness to other people, other experiences. </p> <p>I daresay there are still some kids playing the cello as loudly and enthusiastically as I once did and slopping loads of red and green paint on giant grey rolls of paper in some airy art room. I hope so. </p> <p>The conference, Promoting Comprehensive Education in the 21st century takes place this Saturday, February 3, 11am-4pm, at the University of London Union, Malet Street, London WC1.

But as a parent, I am acutely aware of how different things are now from the 70s. For those of us who still want to live the comprehensive dream for our children it is getting much harder. Parental choice has meant the introduction of what is, in effect, hidden selection. Education, particularly in the inner cities, has come to resemble a minefield where the aim seems chiefly to negotiate your child's safe passage through the system. As a result, anxiety about education has reached almost fever pitch. I have been at three- year-olds' birthday parties where the parents sit, chomping crisps and swapping information about the local secondary schools with all the intensity of Pokemon obsessives. There obviously is a genuine dilemma here. In some boroughs the local school will amount to a sink school which does not represent the true mix of talent and type in that locality, a school which has for one reason or another lost hope. But what parents do not realise is how often this is the result of education policy, the price of parental choice, rather than the failure of one headmaster, one set of teachers or a particular local authority. This isn't personal, it's politics. Results in Scotland, which adopted a completely comprehensive system in the 70s, show that pupils actually thrive under such a system, which in effect removes the right of politicians to create schools for the specially gifted or create special places for special children, as New Labour plans to do. And on recent results, comprehensive Cheshire outperforms selective Kent on every achievement indicator available. But let's not get too gloomy. There remain many schools, even within inner cities, that we can still call more or less comprehensive. Here, pupils get good enough results which is all that exams should be about anyway; a statement of intent, a window on to the next stage of learning. Changes to the national curriculum have, to some extent, allayed middle-class anxiety about achievement. Certainly, a bright six-year-old today seems incredibly literate and numerate compared to when I was a child. What remains, as ever, is anxiety about social mixing. This is partly an age-old middle class fear of the underclass, partly a wish to educate one's children with other children of the same background and partly a pretty simple kind of snobbery that uses education as a way of keeping one's children separate from most ordinary children. But for that, there are always private schools. But in those schools that retain a genuine social mix, there exists the same kind of excitement that I remember from my school days. I see something of the same spirit in the teenagers I know at these schools; a lack of fear, an absence of arrogance, a genuine openness to other people, other experiences. I daresay there are still some kids playing the cello as loudly and enthusiastically as I once did and slopping loads of red and green paint on giant grey rolls of paper in some airy art room. I hope so. The conference, Promoting Comprehensive Education in the 21st century takes place this Saturday, February 3, 11am-4pm, at the University of London Union, Malet Street, London WC1.

But for all the myths of male disadvantage, there are some unavoidable, uncomfortable truths. Boys do take longer than girls to develop both their fine-motor and cognitive skills (whether the difference is genetic or developmental is still up for grabs, but the results are indisputable).

Various ideas to engage boys in learning have been flung around, with a few common themes cropping up. After all, if they're not interested in school, what are they interested in? The answer, say many, is football. </p> <p>David Blunkett launched Playing for Success, a national initiative run in association with football clubs and the local education authorities, to establish out-of-hours study support centres for underachieving children at key stages 2 and 3.

Letts has just published key stage 2 numeracy and literacy workbooks linked to Manchester United and Liverpool. Nike has launched Nike FC, a mixture of football training and cross-curricular activities for use in schools, and the English and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has produced Howzat, a similar mix of physical education and classroom resources for key stage 2. The publishers are understandably sensitive to any accusations of sexism -<sub> </sub>all stress that their materials are designed to appeal to girls as well as boys - yet all admit that their resources are aimed primarily at boys. </p> <p>One man who is not surprised by the move towards sport-led education is Robert Powell, headteacher of Blurton High School in Stoke-on-Trent. \"Many of the children have low aspirations and low levels of achievement,\" he says, \"and I was brought in to the school in 1997 with a brief to raise standards.\" Recognising that there was little enthusiasm for classroom literacy and numeracy work, Powell devised a series of games for lunchtime and after-school clubs revolving around anything from snooker to cricket to the TV gameshow Blockbusters. When he heard about the Playing for Success scheme he was one of the first to get involved. Which was just as well, because Stoke City were relegated from the first division within weeks of joining the scheme and would have been ineligible thereafter. \"Even though the scheme was primarily aimed at key stage 2, I wanted to be part of it,\" Powell continues, \"because I knew that many of the underachieving children in the city would eventually come to Blurton High and become our problem. </p> <p>\"The Sats results from the participating schools have improved and the youngsters really seem to enjoy learning in that environment.

Their content is, as you might expect, resolutely glossy and upbeat; in particular, there are no questions of the \"If David Beckham is paid \u00a3100,000 per week, how long will it take him to earn the money to buy seven Ferraris?\" variety. </p> <p>If the club workbooks are more aimed at the \"sons and fathers bonding over homework\" market, Nike and the ECB have targeted schools. Nike has demonstrated its product in over 50 schools in London and Manchester since its launch in November and the ECB hopes eventually to get Howzat into all the UK's primary and secondary schools. \"Even though it is free, no school will use it unless the teachers understand it and are behind it,\" says David Leighton, primary schools development executive for the ECB. \"So we are concentrating most of our efforts on making teachers aware of what it is about.\" </p> <p>Initial responses to all these publications have been overwhelmingly positive, but their success raises a fundamental question. Getting boys to raise their academic standards through sport is all very well, but does it not also reinforce the macho belief system that physicality is in and learning is uncool? </p> <p>Powell acknowledges the problem but believes the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. \"Research has shown that boys often feel it is only OK to be academically successful providing they are good at sport,\" he says. \"Those who are academically able but not particularly sporty often get teased.

It was typical of Gulliver's style that he sold Oriel to a US conglomerate, then repurchased it a few years later at a substantially lower price.

Argyll's attempted takeover was typical of Gulliver's brashness and ambition. The Scotch maker was a pillar of the country's business world and, while its performance had been miserable, it was much bigger than Argyll.</p> <p>Distillers reacted with horror to the notion of being acquired by a grocer, and was forced to seek salvation through a deal with Guinness. Its shareholders were almost evenly divided between the two offers, however, and, in its desperation to win the battle, Guinness engaged in what was later judged to be an illegal but successful operation to shore up its share price. Argyll lost the battle for Distillers, and it was little consolation to receive \u00a3100m compensation from the victor after details of its illegal activities emerged.</p> <p>The battle also led to the end of Grant's partnership with Gulliver, who was revealed to have over-claimed his education at Harvard Business School.

Mirror editor Piers Morgan, keen to keep his old mate out of the straitjacket, has offered to fund a brief stay at the Priory, but frankly we think things may have moved too far for that. More tomorrow. \u0095 On similar territory, after reading his explanation (\"the crocodile ate my prep, honest it did, sir\") in the Worthing Guardian as to why he couldn't vote either way on the hunting bill, my colleague Marina Hyde rings Peter Bottomley to ask if he is feeling quite all right? \"If Matthew Norman wants to ask me about my health,\" replies poor Bumley, \"he can call me himself.\" Marina says that she wants to know. \"If Matthew Norman wants to ask me about my health, he can call me himself.\" On hearing the mantra for the tenth time, Marina's patience goes. \"Where... is... your... carer?\" she asks. \"Could I speak to your carer?\" This is too much, and the last we heard Bumley was demanding to talk to the editor. Oh dear. \u0095 Louche gay icon Baroness Young attracts more cheeky innuendo by the day. When the saucy old haddock went on to the Today programme yesterday to make some parodic complaint about the morning-after pill, Sue McGregor couldn't resist it. \"Do you think you are going to get your way in the Lords later today?\" Ooh, yer Ladyship! diary@theguardian.com",

But was this judge British? Of course not. The Privy Council is made up of our own law lords and a few judges of equal seniority from other countries. But as no woman has ever reached the House of Lords as a law lord, none from this country has been on the Privy Council. New Zealand, by contrast, has a woman chief justice, Sian Elias, and it is she who has the hugely belated honour of being the first female judge on the Privy Council. Her judicial brilliance is spoken of in hushed tones in upper legal circles, and it turns out that she was born in Britain, of Welsh and Armenian parentage.

I haven't had such a cultural shock since Lord Hoffmann introduced into one of his judgments the concept of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat (no, I'm not going to explain the principle; sufficient that you know that S. was big in wave mechanics) but he didn't do it in the first few words, as Burnton did. I fear we may be on the verge of a wave of judicial intellectualism. It will soon become impossible to read a judgment without recourse to several encyclopaedias.

I feel a whole new area of law coming on. Should not all fathers now take blood tests to confirm - or not - their alleged paternity? Even if only a small percentage find that their paternal assumptions have been misguided, their litigation should keep several dozen lawyers in Tuscan villas for some time. Incidentally, the Lord Chancellor's Department wishes the polymath judge to be referred to, unusually, by his first name as well, as Mr Justice Stanley Burnton.

Pepe Kaur often stops off for a brief visit to St James's Park, which many find an oasis of calm. Her forays there, however, bring on palpitations and panic attacks. She goes with a psychotherapist, one of three mental health professionals treating her for post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>The visits are part of her therapy. Kaur claims that her illness, which is so severe that she once blacked out during an anxiety attack and woke up in hospital, is the result of her time as a probationer in the Royal Parks Police. She went on sick leave last July and has not worked since.</p> <p>Her tale of how her colleagues allegedly ostracised her, compiled a dossier of false or misleading allegations against her and delayed coming to her aid in potentially dangerous situations leaves her in tears. The parks police are contesting Kaur's claim of race discrimination and victimisation against the force. An employment tribunal which is due to hear her case next April will decide whether her claims are true. Her solicitor, David Tyme, from the south London firm Fisher Meredith, says: \"We do anticipate that some se nior officers will be giving evidence in support of her.\"</p> <p>The police force has brought in an outside consultant to carry out an inquiry. \"We have appointed an independent ACAS-recommended investigator to look into all aspects of the allegations and cannot comment until the investigation is completed,\" said a spokesman. Kaur's story suggests that it may take more than well-intentioned high-level recruitment initiatives before police forces in Britain manage to attract and retain enough black and Asian officers to mirror the diversity of the communities they serve.</p> <p>The embarrassing revelation this month that the Met's 218 new \"ethnic minority\" recruits included 214 whites from such places as Ireland, Canada and Australia tells its own tale. Forces around the country are struggling to meet targets for black and Asian recruitment. There are proposals to merge the Royal Parks Police into the Met, and Kaur, born in Birmingham to a Sikh family, could have helped boost the figures.</p> <p>She says it was always her dream to join the police. At 18 she was told by a Met recruitment officer to go out and get more experience of life and they'd welcome her back. Five years ago she had a daughter. In 1999 she passed assessments by both the Met and the parks police, but chose the latter to fit in better with her family responsibilities. With a white partner, she says she had never experienced racism and never expected to find it in the police.</p> <p>But to Patrick Franklin, a black detective sergeant in the Met who has just ended an 18-month stint as national coordinator for the National Black Police Association, her story is a familiar one. Tough men have also shed tears in his room at the Home Office as they told of their experiences.</p> <p>Has he encountered racism himself in nearly 19 years in the Met? \"Oh, God, yes. Many times I thought of giving it up.\" Few blacks and Asians join the police, and those who do are much more likely than their white counterparts to leave.</p> <p>A study of eight police forces carried out in late 98-early 99 by the Home Office's own policing and reducing crime unit found that retention figures for ethnic minority officers had deteriorated over the previous four years, while those for whites had improved. Ethnic minority officers were twice as likely as whites to resign and two to three times as likely to be dismissed. If they stayed, they took longer to obtain promotion or posts outside mainstream uniform policing.</p> <p>The study concludes that the difference in the career patterns, according to the definitions used in the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, \"is enough in itself to conclude that institutional racism has played a part in defining the careers of ethnic minority officers\".</p> <p>Only 20% of those interviewed for the study did not see race or racism as a problem during their careers: 60% had had negative experiences with some real or perceived impact on their careers, while another 20% reported experiencing \"different\" treatment but felt their careers had not been hampered. The interviewers were told bluntly: \"Racism is part of the 'canteen culture'.\"</p> <p>For another study, this time independent of the Home Office, Ellis Cashmore, professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University, interviewed black and Asian officers in five police forces in the aftermath of the 1999 Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence. Interviewees believed that \"persistent habitual racist practices by white officers serves as the most formidable impediment to recruitment,\" the report concluded. Ethnic minority officers felt they were subjected to racist abuse as a way of \"testing\" them.</p> <p>Kaur alleges that her colleagues regularly excluded her, leaving her to patrol alone even at night. Fellow officers explained delays in answering calls for urgent assistance by claiming they couldn't understand what she was saying over the radio - she has a slight Birmingham accent with a south London overlay.</p> <p>\"'Urgent assistance' is the highest level of urgency,\" explains Franklin. \"When you get that, you chuck your burgers or whatever away. It could be a life-threatening situation.\" Though only a probationer and on her own, Kaur had to confront a suspect carrying a stick. On another occasion she jumped out in front of a black cab and tackled a suspect unaided as he tried to leave the cab, sustaining severe bruising to her arm.</p> <p>She says she looked for her colleague, but he was nowhere to be seen. \"They never directly said to me 'black' or 'Paki' or whatever, but when you walk in the room they move away and they giggle.\" She alleges that one colleague made disparaging references to her \"smell\". Her notebook, in which she was recording her work experiences, went missing from her coat pocket. Later she found under a chair a necklace her daughter had made for her and which she had used as a bookmark.</p> <p>The final straw was the day last July when she came on duty at 6 am. She says she had asked a colleague to ring her and tell her what time she was down on the list to go on security patrol. She came back to the station at 7.30 to discover she should have been on patrol at 7. \"It was 7.30 and I was not on my ground. If an inspector from Hyde Park had come down and seen that I wasn't there I would have lost my job instantly.</p> <p>\"I got very, very upset. I ran upstairs and I confronted him. He said there were enough people out there. I said to him 'I asked you to tell me and you didn't tell me'. He didn't answer. I went downstairs and cried my eyes out. You feel so hurt and you just can't take it any more. And I thought I just can't carry on like this. I remember standing there at guard change, because it was time to do guard change, and you're supposed to be a strong officer standing there with all these crowds. And I'm standing there with tears coming down my face.\"</p> <p>Afterwards she told the inspector. He handed her a brown envelope containing allegations made by her colleagues accusing her of bad time- keeping, failing to come to their assistance when summoned and incorrect paperwork. \"It was all false,\" she says. \"When I opened that brown envelope I said to the inspector 'I can't take it any more. This is the end. I've fought and I've fought for my job.'\"</p> <p>Her solicitor, David Tyme, observes: \"It's obviously of great concern that allegations like these can be made, in particular in the current climate when every effort is being made to attract officers from ethnic minorities.\"</p>",

A study of eight police forces carried out in late 98-early 99 by the Home Office's own policing and reducing crime unit found that retention figures for ethnic minority officers had deteriorated over the previous four years, while those for whites had improved. Ethnic minority officers were twice as likely as whites to resign and two to three times as likely to be dismissed. If they stayed, they took longer to obtain promotion or posts outside mainstream uniform policing. The study concludes that the difference in the career patterns, according to the definitions used in the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, \"is enough in itself to conclude that institutional racism has played a part in defining the careers of ethnic minority officers\". Only 20% of those interviewed for the study did not see race or racism as a problem during their careers: 60% had had negative experiences with some real or perceived impact on their careers, while another 20% reported experiencing \"different\" treatment but felt their careers had not been hampered. The interviewers were told bluntly: \"Racism is part of the 'canteen culture'.\" For another study, this time independent of the Home Office, Ellis Cashmore, professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University, interviewed black and Asian officers in five police forces in the aftermath of the 1999 Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence. Interviewees believed that \"persistent habitual racist practices by white officers serves as the most formidable impediment to recruitment,\" the report concluded. Ethnic minority officers felt they were subjected to racist abuse as a way of \"testing\" them. Kaur alleges that her colleagues regularly excluded her, leaving her to patrol alone even at night. Fellow officers explained delays in answering calls for urgent assistance by claiming they couldn't understand what she was saying over the radio - she has a slight Birmingham accent with a south London overlay. \"'Urgent assistance' is the highest level of urgency,\" explains Franklin. \"When you get that, you chuck your burgers or whatever away. It could be a life-threatening situation.\" Though only a probationer and on her own, Kaur had to confront a suspect carrying a stick. On another occasion she jumped out in front of a black cab and tackled a suspect unaided as he tried to leave the cab, sustaining severe bruising to her arm. She says she looked for her colleague, but he was nowhere to be seen. \"They never directly said to me 'black' or 'Paki' or whatever, but when you walk in the room they move away and they giggle.\" She alleges that one colleague made disparaging references to her \"smell\". Her notebook, in which she was recording her work experiences, went missing from her coat pocket. Later she found under a chair a necklace her daughter had made for her and which she had used as a bookmark. The final straw was the day last July when she came on duty at 6 am. She says she had asked a colleague to ring her and tell her what time she was down on the list to go on security patrol. She came back to the station at 7.30 to discover she should have been on patrol at 7. \"It was 7.30 and I was not on my ground. If an inspector from Hyde Park had come down and seen that I wasn't there I would have lost my job instantly. \"I got very, very upset. I ran upstairs and I confronted him. He said there were enough people out there. I said to him 'I asked you to tell me and you didn't tell me'. He didn't answer. I went downstairs and cried my eyes out. You feel so hurt and you just can't take it any more. And I thought I just can't carry on like this. I remember standing there at guard change, because it was time to do guard change, and you're supposed to be a strong officer standing there with all these crowds. And I'm standing there with tears coming down my face.\" Afterwards she told the inspector. He handed her a brown envelope containing allegations made by her colleagues accusing her of bad time- keeping, failing to come to their assistance when summoned and incorrect paperwork. \"It was all false,\" she says. \"When I opened that brown envelope I said to the inspector 'I can't take it any more. This is the end. I've fought and I've fought for my job.'\" Her solicitor, David Tyme, observes: \"It's obviously of great concern that allegations like these can be made, in particular in the current climate when every effort is being made to attract officers from ethnic minorities.\"",

Shaw and director Deborah Warner have just returned from an interview for Woman's Hour. </p> <p> <strong> Deborah Warner:</strong> It's interesting that you can go on Woman's Hour and the first question asked is: \"Is it your intention to make Medea sympathetic?\" It suggests that in 2,400 years she has never been seen as sympathetic. Which is a bit of an oversight in performance history. </p> <p><strong> Fiona Shaw:</strong> The iconography is so against her. The myth of Medea is of a screeching, vengeful creature. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> Previous performances make us have dangerous misconceptions about so many of these heroines. Think of when we did Hedda Gabler and how we discovered that the essence of Hedda was that she was a coward, a weak woman. We had to break through 100 years of performance history and the desire of so many actresses to play strong female roles. Here it is even harder. You have a 2,400-year-old stone to crack to get at the fossil within. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> What you are saying about people in a weak position is interesting. Audiences can identify with weakness. I think the Greek playwrights knew that. That they could entice the audience into an emotional debate about failure and dealing with being a failed person. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> What's so surprising is that we are surprised by that. It leads back to our misplaced image of Medea as a strong, wilful, witchy woman who slaughters her children. In fact she spends the play struggling to find the strength to do the deed. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> Necessity provides the final push because she knows that if she doesn't kill the children, someone else will and far more savagely. I am interested by the connection between somebody's capacity to kill a child and their capacity for romance. The idea of romantic love corrupts Medea - it corrupts us all. We love the idea of someone who is prepared to give up life for another. We heap praise on couples who we perceive as being romantic. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> Ah, but what happens when Posh and Becks come to grief? What is it about our society that makes us idealise the notion of romantic love? </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> The idea of romantic love goes hand in hand with our sentimentalising of children. We say we put them first, but we don't. We are narcissistic in the way we love. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> The children are not the centre of Medea and Jason's world. Medea and Jason are. There is a vanity about that. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> But Medea isn't a warped person. She is very normal. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> She is. She loves Jason, the children, and her house. She is the happy housewife of Corinth. But there is an abnormality that must be spoken about. Her passion for Jason is so great that she murdered her brother for him. That's why when Jason wants to trade her in for a younger model, it is so devastating for her. She has given up everything for him. It is what ties them together. From the moment she killed her brother, Jason was never going to be able to just walk away from her. </p> <p>He can't afford to see it like that. He believes in his argument that if he marries Creon's daughter they will get this thing called security. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> Oh yes, he believes it but he doesn't have the self-knowledge to realise what it means for Medea. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> He won't or can't take on board her broken heart. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> There is part of him that just wants to start again and part that wants it all to be all right. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> He wouldn't be the world's first man to think that he can have a new wife while the old one and their children are in the background. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> Surely part of the problem is that he has replaced domestic happiness with political ambition. What's that line of the Chorus? \"A man tired of domesticity goes out.\" Domesticity is tiring, at least for men it is. That's the difference between the sexes, between Jason and Medea. What Medea mourns is her lost domestic life - for her it was a golden life. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> Yes. The challenge is getting a modern audience to really understand what banishment will mean to Medea. We've lost touch with the idea. We know about refugees, we can imagine what it might be like to be awoken in the early morning by a knock at the door, marched off to Heathrow and put on a plane, but it is hard to capture just how terrible banishment would be for Medea. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> The whole thing is a challenge. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> I think it is the most exacting thing I've ever done. It is unbelievably tough for the cast. It is like a piece of music. The top C has to be played at precisely the right moment or the whole thing crumbles. If you don't hit the right notes then the audience never understands why she kills the children. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> She just becomes an oddity. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> More than that. If you fail to offer a reason why she does it, how necessary it is for her to kill them, it becomes pornography. There is a huge gap between her saying \"die children\" on page three and her actually doing it on page 49. The massive misunderstanding that has derailed this play in the past is the belief that what she says at the beginning is what she does at the end. They are two completely different things. The tragedy of Medea is that in the end, because of the other choices she makes, she has no choice but to kill her sons. </p> <p><strong> Shaw:</strong> This play reminds you of the terrible things we say casually to each other. Like: \"If you don't come in from the garden I'll kill you.\" We excrete language. The play closes the gap between the part of you that flies off and our civilised selves. </p> <p><strong> Warner:</strong> But it's not about revenge. It is never about revenge, although it plays with the idea of revenge when she sends the bomb to the palace. I've thought about her killing the children in terms of recently documented cases of parents killing their children, often during divorce proceedings. But what comes closest is a photograph I once saw. It was of two dead little boys laid out with white blindfolds over their eyes. Standing by them was a ruddy-faced German housefrau who had been a committed Nazi supporter and the Nazis had lost. She had killed her own children and apparently, after the photographer left, she killed herself. I can't get the image out of my mind. </p> <p>\u0095 Medea is at the Queen's Theatre, London W1 (020-7494 5040), until April 14.</p>",

Shaw: The whole thing is a challenge. Warner: I think it is the most exacting thing I've ever done. It is unbelievably tough for the cast. It is like a piece of music. The top C has to be played at precisely the right moment or the whole thing crumbles. If you don't hit the right notes then the audience never understands why she kills the children. Shaw: She just becomes an oddity. Warner: More than that. If you fail to offer a reason why she does it, how necessary it is for her to kill them, it becomes pornography. There is a huge gap between her saying \"die children\" on page three and her actually doing it on page 49. The massive misunderstanding that has derailed this play in the past is the belief that what she says at the beginning is what she does at the end. They are two completely different things. The tragedy of Medea is that in the end, because of the other choices she makes, she has no choice but to kill her sons. Shaw: This play reminds you of the terrible things we say casually to each other. Like: \"If you don't come in from the garden I'll kill you.\" We excrete language. The play closes the gap between the part of you that flies off and our civilised selves. Warner: But it's not about revenge. It is never about revenge, although it plays with the idea of revenge when she sends the bomb to the palace. I've thought about her killing the children in terms of recently documented cases of parents killing their children, often during divorce proceedings. But what comes closest is a photograph I once saw. It was of two dead little boys laid out with white blindfolds over their eyes. Standing by them was a ruddy-faced German housefrau who had been a committed Nazi supporter and the Nazis had lost. She had killed her own children and apparently, after the photographer left, she killed herself. I can't get the image out of my mind. \u0095 Medea is at the Queen's Theatre, London W1 (020-7494 5040), until April 14.",

Edward Albee hacked a Broadway play out of the book and there was even an Alan Jay Lerner musical, which mercifully expired in Boston. Now the great Italian director Luca Ronconi has staged a four-hour Lolita at Milan's Piccolo Theatre, using a translation of Nabokov's original screenplay for the Kubrick film. The result is visually stunning. It also leaves you feeling that Nabokov's novel eludes its most ardent pursuers. </p> <p>Ronconi's approach is undeniably serious. He and his adapter, Ugo Tessitore, clearly understand that Nabokov's novel is not about paedophilia, but about the confrontation of European experience and supposed American innocence, and about the author's own love-affair with the English language. At the same time Ronconi tries to re-create the visual texture of the novel and its evocation of suburban American towns. But there is a contradiction here which Ronconi never fully resolves. His version tries to be \"literary\" and \"cinematic\" at the same time; but, in the contest between the word and the image, the latter inevitably wins. </p> <p>In a technical sense, Ronconi's production is astonishing. Anyone who remembers his promenade Orlando Furioso, with its simultaneous performance of multiple scenes, will know he has a genius for theatrical motion. Here the stage is in constant revolution. Live action is synchronised with video images. Furniture passes across the stage as if on a conveyor belt. And there are endless levels of reality so that Humbert Humbert is shadowed by a Nabokovian narrator and there are two Lolitas on stage: an American-speaking nymphet, and another representing both her Italian voice and her sadder, older self. </p> <p>The result is like an encounter between Proust and Monty Python. The Proustian element stems from the adoption of the novel's form of a confessional memory. And Python comes to mind because Margherita Palli's designs are influenced by the animations of Terry Gilliam. At best, the Proustian and Pythonesque elements magically combine, as when the hand of the adult Humbert reaches out to touch the projected image of his first love, the 13-year-old Annabel, whose premature death provoked his tragic obsession. </p> <p>But the visual information overpowers the narrative. When, for instance, Humbert and Lolita first take to the road and arrive at a swank place called The Enchanted Hunters, everything is out of scale: the human figures are dwarfed by giant doors and even the purple bedroom is dominated by a king-size bed. The reference to Alice in Wonderland is wittily appropriate: in Nabokov, as in Carroll, the nymphet becomes the decadent's obscure object of desire. But you are more conscious of the bed and the visual allusion than you are of the irony of the situation: that Humbert's nervous prevarication is overcome by the matter-of-fact sensuality of Lolita herself. </p> <p>That, in itself, raises the delicate question of the story's sexuality and, to be fair, Ronconi handles it with great discretion. He makes it clear that Nabokov's story is partly about the myth of childhood innocence: the younger Lolita, played by Elif Mangold, lolls teasingly on the lawn in her sun-specs and shorts, is seen getting her leg over a boy at summer camp and escapes with Humbert's doppelganger, Clare Quilty, clamped to a gigantic telephone receiver. </p> <p>In general, Ronconi plays down the sexuality in order to make a larger point, that Lolita symbolises the American experience which eludes the sophisticated European emigre. That, however, merely highlights the difficulty of adaptation. In Nabokov's book Lolita is both a nymphet and a literary device. In one famous scene the hero achieves orgasm while she plays on his lap and bites an apple. In print, Nabokov makes the point that Humbert is excited by the Lolita of his imagination; if played on stage, which thankfully it is not, the scene loses its linguistic subtlety. The corporeality of the theatre is at odds with the multivalent nature of Nabokov's novel, one that constantly exists on the levels of both realism and verbal arabesque. </p> <p>What one is left with in Milan is a visually audacious but over-strenuous attempt to encompass the Nabokov screenplay. You can admire the technical skill with which it is done, but the evening confirms the need to respect integrity of form. Ronconi offers a theatrical version of a screenplay derived from a novel. It has an imagistic brilliance but it can match neither the fluid rhythm of film nor the linguistic density of fiction. It offers a dazzling illustration of the novel but in the end Nabokov remains as elusive as Lolita - \"light of my life, fire of my loins\" - was to Humbert Humbert himself. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Teatro Strehler, Piccolo Teatro, Milan until March 4.

      "body": "<b> Oona King, Labour MP</b> <br> <p> <b> 7.30am</b> I feel it's a bit early to watch Angela Rippon doing high-leg kicks in a micro-miniskirt, so switch off the TV. It's not fair to have a go at Angela, she's just having \"a bit of fun\". A talented older man would be able to continue a \"serious\" news career, but the talented Angela does the knickerbocker routine. Is it what she wants? Maybe, but that begs the question, why? The answer is probably a lifetime of stereotyped images. Before switching off, I see an ad for the new Peugeot 607 and ask myself what a woman's half-starved, semi-naked body has to do with a V6 engine. </p> <p><b> Midday</b> Another journey, another billboard and this time it's alcohol - cognac. The ad reads: \"Rules? I make them up as I go along.\" It shows a very beautiful woman, silk dress slit to the crotch, oozing sex and availability. Again, this implies she's yours so long as the price is right. There's no getting away from it: members of my gender are portrayed as whimsical whores, no matter what the product. That is the one rule that never changes. And the one product used to sell all others is the female body. </p> <p>New crime statistics show that, though overall crime is down, violent crime is up. More women being attacked. I'm an old-fashioned type who thinks crime against women is linked to media portrayals of pouting, lusting females who say no but mean yes. And even if they say yes but mean no, who cares? After all, like a car, a woman is a ticket to ride. </p> <p><b> 11.30pm</b> Driving home after a late vote, I spot a billboard with Claudia Schiffer spread across it, advertising the \"new look\" Citro\u00ebn Xsara. The poster reads: \"Travel in a safer world.\" Would women be safer if they bought a Citro\u00ebn Xsara? Would recordedincidents of rape fall? Obviously not, but then the point isn't to make women feel safer, it's to make men feel safer. And of course the ad doesn't have a direct link to rape. It's just one of a million daily messages telling us the most important thing about a woman is her body. And if you haven't got a woman's body to hand, go and grab one. </p> <p><b> Midnight</b> Arrive home. Try to wind down by watching TV. As my partner is Italian, we have Italian cable TV. Every single show includes the obligatory semi-naked attractive women prostrating themselves before the semi-ugly male presenter. I finally realise what's driving me nuts: it's not the naked women, it's the imbalance. If for every naked woman I saw a naked man, I'd be happy. And if for every semi-naked male presenter there was a semi-ugly female presenter, I'd be even happier. </p> <p>At my constituency surgery earlier in the week, one woman showed me her wrists where she'd slit them. Another sobbed quietly about her forthcoming eviction. She will be on the streets, her life is in ruins, yet she clutches her lipstick like a security blanket. The lipstick, the make-up, the concealer: we know it's a mask, but most of us are suckers. Whether we like it or not, at some level we're trying to conceal the fact that we're not Claudia or Naomi or Kate. And until it's all right for us not to be - the same way it's all right for men not to be Brad or Bruce - then I will remain irritated by the sight of Sophie Dahl with her legs apart as I drive to work. </p> <p><b> Tamzin Outhwaite, EastEnders actor</b><br> </p> <p> <b> 7am</b> On my way to work, I spot a McDonald's ad which reminds me that I haven't eaten yet. I don't crave McDonald's, but I increase my speed, hoping I can grab a bacon sandwich and a coffee before work. </p> <p><b> 10am</b> While browsing through Elle, I spot an Oasis ad with a healthy-looking girl in red lying on the grass with shiny, scarlet tomatoes all around her. She is smiling with her eyes closed, looking ecstatic. All I can think is how I need to eat more fruit and veg. I don't think: \"Must rush to Oasis to buy some new clothes.\" </p> <p><b> 8pm </b> Go to meet friends for a drink and am amazed to see new flats on an area that used to be a park. A billboard on the corner reads: \"Stunning landmark development capturing the Islington lifestyle with Armani-suited concierge, air-conditioning, gym, parking.\" Could an Armani suit on a concierge really be a factor in the huge decision to buy a property? The thought that someone would be impressed by this makes me sad. </p> <p><b> 11pm</b> Late-night ads always appear more interesting and after a long day, I am relaxing in front of the TV when I see one for Secret Satin. It consists of many flashing images of hunky, built-up men, leaving me wondering what the product is. I wait and wait, and eventually it appears. It is a deodorant and an English rose-like girl gives a sexy look. That's it? Is the message that if you wear Secret Satin you can be with men like this? Or is it that this type of man will wear you out and Secret Satin is the only way to stay dry? I resign myself to the fact that sex sells. </p> <p>Straight out of one mood, into another as the next commercial has a really positive vibe. Funny how a two-minute ad can make you feel part of something big, united with the world. There is poetry displayed over beautiful lakeland images and it could have brought a tear to my eye - but now I'm staring at a direct debit sign. I know it's all about money but I can't help feeling uplifted. Conned but uplifted. </p> <p><b> Juliet Soskice, St Luke's ad agency</b><br> </p> <p> <b> 7am</b> Wake up. Put telly on. I was one of those kids brought up in the 70s by book-reading parents who didn't see the point of having a TV, especially as it contained \"rubbishy adverts\". The upshot is that I have become an adult obsessed by TV and by advertising. </p> <p><b> 7.05am</b> Cup of tea. The Big Breakfast has some great ad breaks and I'm disappointed when people are snobby about advertising. Without it, there'd be no Channel 4 and your Weekend Guardian would cost you a fiver. And advertising is so often a part of the entertainment experience - would Vogue be better without all the beautiful photos selling beautiful stuff ? </p> <p><b> 7.20am</b> Leave for gym. On my way, I pass the bus stop where there's an ad for a gentlemen's club (lap-dancing, I presume) called Spearmint Rhino, with a strangely dated photo of a pouting woman with collagen lips. It looks inappropriate, even pathetic, at this time in the morning in the cold. It'll look even stranger in an hour when the bus stop is crowded with mums, kids and OAPs. And it's offensive - of course. Unfortunately there are plenty of ads that are crass, but if you choose never to look, you're closing your eyes to something vibrant and telling about our culture. </p> <p><b> 8.30am</b> Get to work at St Luke's, where I am marketing and new business director. The creative director is Kate Stanners, one of only two women creative directors in the top 30 London agencies. Advertising is a great business for a woman to be in, but I am terribly aware that while women organise, administrate, plan, run and direct, hardly any of us actually writes the ads. It's a great shame. </p> <p><b> 1pm</b> At lunch I sit with a copywriter and planner - both women - and we talk about ads we like. The consensus is that creative departments often do brilliant \"bloke\" ads. Think of the \"wobbly belly\" Reebok or Tango ads, which are great if you are a bloke and great if you aren't. But why is it that only 17% of copywriters and 14% of art directors are women? </p> <p><b> 3pm</b> R4's Today programme rings to ask if someone can go on to defend the latest IKEA ad, featuring a naked tattooed man, as it's been voted most hated ad of the year by one magazine and best campaign of the year by another. We are all delighted because advertising should be provocative and insightful, treat people intelligently and create debate. Any ad that ridicules or upsets people who don't deserve it is rarely good advertising. </p> <p><b> 7pm</b> To pub for quick drink. Going home, I pass the Spearmint Rhino ad again and remember a poignant quote in last year's major report by Debbie Klein into women in advertising.

      "bodyText": "Oona King, Labour MP 7.30am I feel it's a bit early to watch Angela Rippon doing high-leg kicks in a micro-miniskirt, so switch off the TV. It's not fair to have a go at Angela, she's just having \"a bit of fun\". A talented older man would be able to continue a \"serious\" news career, but the talented Angela does the knickerbocker routine. Is it what she wants? Maybe, but that begs the question, why? The answer is probably a lifetime of stereotyped images. Before switching off, I see an ad for the new Peugeot 607 and ask myself what a woman's half-starved, semi-naked body has to do with a V6 engine. Midday Another journey, another billboard and this time it's alcohol - cognac. The ad reads: \"Rules? I make them up as I go along.\" It shows a very beautiful woman, silk dress slit to the crotch, oozing sex and availability. Again, this implies she's yours so long as the price is right. There's no getting away from it: members of my gender are portrayed as whimsical whores, no matter what the product. That is the one rule that never changes. And the one product used to sell all others is the female body. New crime statistics show that, though overall crime is down, violent crime is up. More women being attacked. I'm an old-fashioned type who thinks crime against women is linked to media portrayals of pouting, lusting females who say no but mean yes. And even if they say yes but mean no, who cares? After all, like a car, a woman is a ticket to ride. 11.30pm Driving home after a late vote, I spot a billboard with Claudia Schiffer spread across it, advertising the \"new look\" Citro\u00ebn Xsara. The poster reads: \"Travel in a safer world.\" Would women be safer if they bought a Citro\u00ebn Xsara? Would recordedincidents of rape fall? Obviously not, but then the point isn't to make women feel safer, it's to make men feel safer. And of course the ad doesn't have a direct link to rape. It's just one of a million daily messages telling us the most important thing about a woman is her body. And if you haven't got a woman's body to hand, go and grab one. Midnight Arrive home. Try to wind down by watching TV. As my partner is Italian, we have Italian cable TV. Every single show includes the obligatory semi-naked attractive women prostrating themselves before the semi-ugly male presenter. I finally realise what's driving me nuts: it's not the naked women, it's the imbalance. If for every naked woman I saw a naked man, I'd be happy. And if for every semi-naked male presenter there was a semi-ugly female presenter, I'd be even happier. At my constituency surgery earlier in the week, one woman showed me her wrists where she'd slit them. Another sobbed quietly about her forthcoming eviction. She will be on the streets, her life is in ruins, yet she clutches her lipstick like a security blanket. The lipstick, the make-up, the concealer: we know it's a mask, but most of us are suckers. Whether we like it or not, at some level we're trying to conceal the fact that we're not Claudia or Naomi or Kate. And until it's all right for us not to be - the same way it's all right for men not to be Brad or Bruce - then I will remain irritated by the sight of Sophie Dahl with her legs apart as I drive to work.

The thought that someone would be impressed by this makes me sad. 11pm Late-night ads always appear more interesting and after a long day, I am relaxing in front of the TV when I see one for Secret Satin. It consists of many flashing images of hunky, built-up men, leaving me wondering what the product is. I wait and wait, and eventually it appears.

      "bodyText": "A five-year-old girl died after a routine operation to extract a tooth because of the incompetent and improper actions of a dentist and an anaesthetist, a court was told yesterday. Karla Selley died in hospital in August 1999 after a visit to the Towngate dental surgery in Leyland, Lancashire. Dentist Michael Lane, 42, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, and anaesthetist George Vanner, 67, of Bilsborrow, Lancashire, deny charges of manslaughter at Preston crown court. Howard Bentham QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Karla choked to death on blood, mucus and debris after having her tooth removed, because of a catalogue of errors by the two men. Mr Bentham said that Karla, of Leyland, had been taken to the surgery by her mother, Tracey, on August 9 to have a baby tooth removed. He said that because of a previous unhappy experience when Karla had a tooth removed, it had been agreed that she would be given a general anaesthetic. \"The operation was completed very quickly and it was uneventful in its early and middle stages,\" he said. \"The tooth was removed without problems but as Karla was coming round from the anaesthetic, problems arose. From these problems she died.\" Mr Bentham said a hospital had not been notified about the operation, as was normal. Her mouth was not swept with suction before the tooth was removed as it should have been. The court heard she was not hooked up to an electrocardiagraph machine or a pulse oxymeter to monitor her heart beat and reactions while she was unconscious and her mouth was not swept for a second time after the extraction of the tooth to remove debris, mucus and blood. In addition there were only three people present in the room during the operation rather than four as was usual. Following the removal of the tooth, Lane left the room against regulations, Mr Bentham said. \"It's at this stage that problems began to be apparent. Karla coughed, she pushed against Dr Vanner and she changed colour.\" Mr Bentham added: \"The dentist should have been in the room at that stage, but he was not. He returned very quickly then because Karla was obviously in trouble and breathing resuscitation began.\" These attempts, the court heard, were described by one witness as \"hopeless\". Mr Bentham said that if this had not been the case, Karla's life could still have been saved. He said Karla was given an electric shock which was much too large for her weight and although this did not lead to her death it was an example of the \"competence\" of the resuscitation technique used on the little girl. The court heard there was no adrenaline at the surgery and when the resuscitation team arrived they noticed Dr Vanner was unable to locate a suitable vein to inject with the adrenaline they brought. He said that a postmortem examination showed Karla had a \"peculiarity\" of the heart but it was the crown's case that this was not responsible for her death. \"It is our case that the anomaly of her heart did not cause her death. That her death was caused by obstruction of the airway, that the airway should not have become obstructed if these two professional men were acting competently and properly, but that even if it did, had they been adequate and competent in the art of resuscitation she could have been held back from the danger she found herself in.\" The case continues.",

      "body": "<p>Hywel Williams's verbal assault upon Peter Mandelson, (It's a gay thing, January 27) depends upon the assertion that homosexuals of a particular period are marked by the same negative characteristics and behaviour.</p> <p>The conviction that present-day homosexuals, unlike their heterosexual counterparts, are inherently unreliable, dishonest and self-destructive, unfit to do anything more than act, make dresses, cut hair and decorate shop windows, flourished in the age of gay witch-hunts - the 50s. Self-loathing homosexuals of Mr Williams's sort might well cling to a belief in such stuff.</p> <p>But by publishing an article dependent upon this discredited, malign claptrap, complete with tasteless references to \"bare-backing, \"one man's bitch\" and \"the shifty fudge-packer\", the Guardian becomes the transmitter of a form of homophobia more virulent than anything published by the tabloid press. <br><b>Nicholas de Jongh</b><br> London</p> <p>Hywel Williams gratuitously inserted a paragraph about Gavin Young into his nasty, confused, illiterate (\"truistically\"!) article. I wrote the obituary of Gavin Young which you published last Monday (January 22). I did not mention homosexuality because, despite 40 years as, first his editor and then his colleague and friend, I never regarded it - unlike Mr Williams - as relevant to his work as a foreign correspondent and author.</p> <p>Mr Williams evidently trades on his own homosexuality. Why should that give him the licence to make casual assertions (two days after the funeral) about the private life of a brave and admired man - or you to publish them? <br><b>Michael Davie</b><br> London</p> <p>For 20 years, a senior civil servant, I fought openly for equal gay rights. These include recognition that sexuality has nothing to do with competence or reliability, and is irrelevant to nearly all work. The idea that gays are by culture chancers and deceivers - more than heterosexuals - is rubbish.</p> <p>All of us make slips we live bitterly to regret. Decent folk then give us a hand up, not a kick. Mandelson has done much for his country and I hope he can one day continue his work, with the support of his life's partner. <br><b>Ian Buist</b><br> London</p> <p>Mandelson is the scapegoat for the public's dislike of the deceitfulness and hypocrisy in British politics. And there lies the bitter irony: his ability to cut through the humbug and speak as he finds has contributed to his downfall. <br><b>Richard Salmon</b><br> London</p> <p>Thank you for your accurate insights into Mandy. I have become a specialist in self-harming behaviour, especially anorexics and self-slashers, and can readily confirm your points from my clinical experience. <br><b>Dr Bob Johnson</b><br> Consultant psychiatrist, special unit, C-wing, Parkhurst prison</p> <p>At least I understand one bit of it, namely the reference to Methodist dullness, where clearly he is out of his depth. <br><b>Rev Dr Timothy Mark</b><br> (Methodist minister) Doncaster <a href=\"timothy.mark@eggconnect.net\">timothy.mark@eggconnect.net</a></p> <p>Homophobia thinly disguised as political commentary?

The conviction that present-day homosexuals, unlike their heterosexual counterparts, are inherently unreliable, dishonest and self-destructive, unfit to do anything more than act, make dresses, cut hair and decorate shop windows, flourished in the age of gay witch-hunts - the 50s. Self-loathing homosexuals of Mr Williams's sort might well cling to a belief in such stuff. But by publishing an article dependent upon this discredited, malign claptrap, complete with tasteless references to \"bare-backing, \"one man's bitch\" and \"the shifty fudge-packer\", the Guardian becomes the transmitter of a form of homophobia more virulent than anything published by the tabloid press. Nicholas de Jongh London Hywel Williams gratuitously inserted a paragraph about Gavin Young into his nasty, confused, illiterate (\"truistically\"!) article. I wrote the obituary of Gavin Young which you published last Monday (January 22). I did not mention homosexuality because, despite 40 years as, first his editor and then his colleague and friend, I never regarded it - unlike Mr Williams - as relevant to his work as a foreign correspondent and author. Mr Williams evidently trades on his own homosexuality. Why should that give him the licence to make casual assertions (two days after the funeral) about the private life of a brave and admired man - or you to publish them? Michael Davie London For 20 years, a senior civil servant, I fought openly for equal gay rights. These include recognition that sexuality has nothing to do with competence or reliability, and is irrelevant to nearly all work. The idea that gays are by culture chancers and deceivers - more than heterosexuals - is rubbish. All of us make slips we live bitterly to regret. Decent folk then give us a hand up, not a kick. Mandelson has done much for his country and I hope he can one day continue his work, with the support of his life's partner. Ian Buist London Mandelson is the scapegoat for the public's dislike of the deceitfulness and hypocrisy in British politics. And there lies the bitter irony: his ability to cut through the humbug and speak as he finds has contributed to his downfall. Richard Salmon London Thank you for your accurate insights into Mandy. I have become a specialist in self-harming behaviour, especially anorexics and self-slashers, and can readily confirm your points from my clinical experience. Dr Bob Johnson Consultant psychiatrist, special unit, C-wing, Parkhurst prison At least I understand one bit of it, namely the reference to Methodist dullness, where clearly he is out of his depth. Rev Dr Timothy Mark (Methodist minister) Doncaster timothy.mark@eggconnect.net Homophobia thinly disguised as political commentary? It's OK, the author's gay. Aine Duffy London Aine.Duffy@tandf.co.uk What a splendid, original, brilliant piece! Boy, is he ever going to take the heat off me this week! Julie Burchill Brighton",

Covers the transfer of energy from one animal to another and loss of energy through body heat. Links to Science Education, Primary Investigations and Sample Lessons are worth a look. Activities www.clickteaching.com Suitable for KS1/2 pupils Select Science, then Animals and Habitats, where there are several activities depending on your children's age (eg, for year 3 there is a cut and stick activity about a simple food chain). For years 4 and 5 select Teaching Food Chains for a sample lesson which includes all the essential vocabulary. You can also download a wall display, which uses a lot of ink but provides very clear material. The food pyramid www.alienexplorer.com/ecology/topic4.html Suitable for KS2 pupils A US site, so American animals are used as examples, such as beavers, moose and groundhogs along with the more familiar mice, rabbits and deer. Children could be asked to come up with British examples. Just a pity that advertising by the site's sponsor is so persistent. Lesson plans www.alternativeparenting.com/lesson_plans/3_through_6/ science_nature/web_of_life.htm Suitable for KS1 pupils and teachers A simpler American site offering a lesson plan suitable for KS1. One practical activity shows how every living thing is dependent on everything else. Resources for teachers web1.si.edu/sites/educate/ troprain/foodchai.html Suitable for teachers The introductory information is quite clear. Select Creating Food Chains and Food Webs for some lesson ideas. Jim Merrett \u0095 The Gothic The Literary Gothic www.litgothic.com Suitable for teachers/KS5 students An exhaustive list of Gothic authors, accompanied by several rare works available as e-texts. Useful resources include concise and readable definitions of Literary Gothicism, Romanticism and Victorianism, as well as a useful page entitled \"Elements of the Gothic Novel\". Monsters www.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/monsters.html Suitable for KS3/4/5 students and teachers A strange site detailing the literary and cinematic appearances of various monsters. As well as a small picture gallery, an interesting essay on monsters in the Middle Ages is featured.

Younger pupils would have needed very structured input. It took me an hour to familiarise myself with the basics. The maker's instructions assumed a certain level of IT literacy. The class really enjoyed it. They learnt about magnification and looked at images projected on to a computer screen. I like the fact that you can save your own images to look at. The microscope could be taken off its stand and pointed [at objects], but the children found it difficult to focus the lens when used in this way (though they still enjoyed fiddling around with it!). It was at its most effective next to the computer where it gave incredibly clear detail. It's a unique product that is reasonable value for money given the cost of a standard microscope.\" </p> <p><strong> Curriculum links</strong> </p> <p><strong> Science KS1/2/3:</strong> Ideas and evidence; Investigative skills.

Use it on field trips, for science investigations, and to record scientific evidence. Sharon Dale, IT co-ordinator, Whirley Primary School, Cheshire, says: \"I used it with a year 6 class, the right age group for the product. Younger pupils would have needed very structured input. It took me an hour to familiarise myself with the basics. The maker's instructions assumed a certain level of IT literacy. The class really enjoyed it. They learnt about magnification and looked at images projected on to a computer screen. I like the fact that you can save your own images to look at. The microscope could be taken off its stand and pointed [at objects], but the children found it difficult to focus the lens when used in this way (though they still enjoyed fiddling around with it!). It was at its most effective next to the computer where it gave incredibly clear detail. It's a unique product that is reasonable value for money given the cost of a standard microscope.\" Curriculum links Science KS1/2/3: Ideas and evidence; Investigative skills.

      "body": "<p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>I am on the foundation year of a four-year engineering course but I am wondering if I have done the right thing. Last year I started another course, but found it was not right for me. I am now worried that I am not cut out for education.</p> <p>What has the working world got to offer a person with a foundation but no degree?</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>Actually, I think your real question is not \"what has the working world got to offer a person with a foundation but no degree\", but \"what do you want out of your working life?\" You have stumbled from one inappropriate course to another, and are now not even sure if you want to study at all. I think you need to step back and undergo some deep self-analysis in order to really discover who you are and what will make you happy before you can start to think effectively about changing direction. </p> <p>Use this process as a guide: </p> <p>\u0095 First of all, you need to know yourself. You need to identify your skills, talents, strength and weaknesses. Not just academic ones, but things like organisational skills, the ability to work under pressure, the ability to get on with people, enjoyment of taking things apart or building things, etc. You will need to look back over your life so far and pick out experiences that you enjoyed or excelled at, and those that you didn't. </p> <p>\u0095 Once you really know yourself, you should start to think about what might make you happy. Would you prefer a well-paid job to a very satisfying one? Are you bothered by what the status of a job and what other people think about you? Do you want to work with people or are you happier with machines? </p> <p>\u0095 Finally, you need to match your skills and desires with a suitable job or profession. Once you have done this, you will have to find out what it takes to succeed in this profession - whether vocational or academic training is required - and decide whether you are able and willing to undertake this. </p> <p>Of course, this three-step process is not easy and takes some time. It is very hard to do on your own, but there are a number of places that can help. First of all, visit your careers office at the university and ask for one of their computerised vocation tests. This will help you go through each of the three stages then match your answers with some suitable professions (some of which may not require a University education). Borrow or buy What Color is Your Parachute?' - an excellent book that will help you sort yourself out. Once you know what you want, you will be more motivated to do what is needed to get there and will stop stumbling around in the darkness searching for what cannot easily be seen.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).</p> <p>Advice given to this problem should only be regarded as a guide based on the limited information provided by the letter-writer. No responsibility can be taken by Dr Mann for any outcomes following advice given.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The problem I am on the foundation year of a four-year engineering course but I am wondering if I have done the right thing. Last year I started another course, but found it was not right for me. I am now worried that I am not cut out for education. What has the working world got to offer a person with a foundation but no degree? The solution Actually, I think your real question is not \"what has the working world got to offer a person with a foundation but no degree\", but \"what do you want out of your working life?\" You have stumbled from one inappropriate course to another, and are now not even sure if you want to study at all. I think you need to step back and undergo some deep self-analysis in order to really discover who you are and what will make you happy before you can start to think effectively about changing direction. Use this process as a guide: \u0095 First of all, you need to know yourself. You need to identify your skills, talents, strength and weaknesses. Not just academic ones, but things like organisational skills, the ability to work under pressure, the ability to get on with people, enjoyment of taking things apart or building things, etc. You will need to look back over your life so far and pick out experiences that you enjoyed or excelled at, and those that you didn't. \u0095 Once you really know yourself, you should start to think about what might make you happy. Would you prefer a well-paid job to a very satisfying one? Are you bothered by what the status of a job and what other people think about you? Do you want to work with people or are you happier with machines? \u0095 Finally, you need to match your skills and desires with a suitable job or profession. Once you have done this, you will have to find out what it takes to succeed in this profession - whether vocational or academic training is required - and decide whether you are able and willing to undertake this. Of course, this three-step process is not easy and takes some time. It is very hard to do on your own, but there are a number of places that can help. First of all, visit your careers office at the university and ask for one of their computerised vocation tests. This will help you go through each of the three stages then match your answers with some suitable professions (some of which may not require a University education). Borrow or buy What Color is Your Parachute?' - an excellent book that will help you sort yourself out. Once you know what you want, you will be more motivated to do what is needed to get there and will stop stumbling around in the darkness searching for what cannot easily be seen. \u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton). Advice given to this problem should only be regarded as a guide based on the limited information provided by the letter-writer. No responsibility can be taken by Dr Mann for any outcomes following advice given.",

Pountney has reworked it so that it fits into the rest of the season's repertoire. The divisions between stage, orchestra and audience are blurred, with only the first violins playing in the pit and the rest of the musicians grouped on platforms round the set.

Given that Nabucco is partly about the transcendence of divisions - religious and political - the metaphor is telling. </p> <p>Pountney, bravely, has also attempted to underscore the gulf that now inevitably separates us from the opera itself. Nabucco's initial success was partly due to its tacit equation of the experience of the exiled Jews in Babylon with that of the Italian nation, smarting in internal exile as armies of occupation tramped across it. Verdi briefly and terrifyingly posits the idea of genocide as the outcome of anti-Semitism, but draws back in sincere optimism by effecting the moral and spiritual redemption of its would-be perpetrators. History has horrifically proved him wrong, as Pountney reminds us by relocating the work in the 20th century. </p> <p>Verdi prefaces each act with Old Testament quotations. Pountney has them spoken in Hebrew by children. We are reminded that man has failed the humanitarian vision that triumphantly reasserts itself at the end of the opera. </p> <p>Pountney also centres on the Lear-like relationship between Nabucco and his daughters - the monstrous, illegitimate Abigaille and Fenena, loving but tough, like Cordelia. The performances here don't always do the roles justice. Bruno Caproni's Nabucco is beautifully sung and affecting as he passes through madness to redemption, though he is not frightening enough as the racist bigot in the earlier scenes. As Fenena, Claire Weston is happier than she was in the unfortunate staging of the Verdi Requiem last year, but she still squalls when her voice is under pressure. </p> <p>On the other hand, Lauren Flanigan's Abigaille remains a terrifying, acutely observed study of the insanity of power, while Alastair Miles's Zaccaria - noble, fervent, vocally spectacular yet genuinely spiritual - is second to none. </p> <p>Conductor Michael Lloyd drives the score with tremendous electricity.

      "body": "<p>The statistics of Ian Pace's world premiere performance of The History of Photography in Sound, by Michael Finnissy, are mind-boggling. The piece is five and a half hours long, and its five books took Pace an entire day to perform at the Royal Academy. None of the 11 separate \"chapters\" is shorter than 15 minutes and the longest, at 75 minutes, lasts the same time as a Mahler symphony. Book four alone is a vast, two-hour structure. </p> <p>The touchstone for enormous piano pieces, Kaikhosru Sorabji's Opus Clavicembalisticum, clocks in on a recent recording at a whisker under four hours - a mere minnow in comparison with the scale of History. Finnissy's main rival for the crown of longest non-repetitive piano piece is La Monte Young's The Well-Tuned Piano. Young's ongoing project now lasts roughhly six hours in performance. </p> <p>The scale of History is monumental, both in length and the physical and technical difficulties the work poses for an interpreter. In accepting the herculean challenge, Pace - long one of Finnissy's closest collaborators - ensured his status as one of the most adventurous pianists of his generation. Yet the main feature of the music, and the performance, was the opposite of the heroic grandiosity you might expect from such a self-consciously huge piece. History expresses instability, ambiguity and crisis. </p> <p>Writing a \"history\" in sound is, in a sense, an impossible task. Music is not capable of expressing the kinds of information needed for such a history, nor the reproductive accuracy of photographs or films. But from the titles and dramas of individual movements, Finnissy's purpose becomes clearer. North American Spirituals, a chapter from the second book, is a critique of the horrors of slavery. The music begins with the spiritual tunes themselves, which gradually become distorted by unpredictable, hysterical outbursts. This is a music of innocence corrupted and perfection disfigured. Here, as elsewhere, Finnissy uses photography as a metaphor for the violence of cultural appropriation. </p> <p>Quotations from Beethoven, Bach, Berlioz and Wagner appear throughout as ciphers for spirituality, love, death and vanity. But Finnissy's range is much wider than the western tradition: Vendan African songs are prominent in book four, as are Moroccan and Berber folk songs; Indian ragas and 1940s pop songs appear in Book 2. Everywhere there is allusion and critique. </p> <p>Finnissy explores the tyranny of power in Parents' Generation Thought War Meant Something, the devastation of colonialism in Unsere Afrikareise and the emptiness of capitalism in Kapitalistisch Realisme.

      "bodyText": "The statistics of Ian Pace's world premiere performance of The History of Photography in Sound, by Michael Finnissy, are mind-boggling. The piece is five and a half hours long, and its five books took Pace an entire day to perform at the Royal Academy. None of the 11 separate \"chapters\" is shorter than 15 minutes and the longest, at 75 minutes, lasts the same time as a Mahler symphony. Book four alone is a vast, two-hour structure. The touchstone for enormous piano pieces, Kaikhosru Sorabji's Opus Clavicembalisticum, clocks in on a recent recording at a whisker under four hours - a mere minnow in comparison with the scale of History. Finnissy's main rival for the crown of longest non-repetitive piano piece is La Monte Young's The Well-Tuned Piano. Young's ongoing project now lasts roughhly six hours in performance. The scale of History is monumental, both in length and the physical and technical difficulties the work poses for an interpreter. In accepting the herculean challenge, Pace - long one of Finnissy's closest collaborators - ensured his status as one of the most adventurous pianists of his generation. Yet the main feature of the music, and the performance, was the opposite of the heroic grandiosity you might expect from such a self-consciously huge piece. History expresses instability, ambiguity and crisis. Writing a \"history\" in sound is, in a sense, an impossible task. Music is not capable of expressing the kinds of information needed for such a history, nor the reproductive accuracy of photographs or films. But from the titles and dramas of individual movements, Finnissy's purpose becomes clearer. North American Spirituals, a chapter from the second book, is a critique of the horrors of slavery. The music begins with the spiritual tunes themselves, which gradually become distorted by unpredictable, hysterical outbursts. This is a music of innocence corrupted and perfection disfigured. Here, as elsewhere, Finnissy uses photography as a metaphor for the violence of cultural appropriation. Quotations from Beethoven, Bach, Berlioz and Wagner appear throughout as ciphers for spirituality, love, death and vanity. But Finnissy's range is much wider than the western tradition: Vendan African songs are prominent in book four, as are Moroccan and Berber folk songs; Indian ragas and 1940s pop songs appear in Book 2. Everywhere there is allusion and critique. Finnissy explores the tyranny of power in Parents' Generation Thought War Meant Something, the devastation of colonialism in Unsere Afrikareise and the emptiness of capitalism in Kapitalistisch Realisme. Representation, he seems to be saying, is always political. Paradoxically, this endless ambivalence produces a music that is full of dramatic contrast and virtuosic spectacle. The chapter Alkan-Paganini that opens the third book is even more jaw-droppingly pyrotechnical than anything by Alkan or Paganini. Pace's strength and conviction were magnificent. Yet there were many passages where his performance seemed more like interior monologue than public event. Although Finnissy's music is one of all-encompassing complexity, it needs vibrant characterisation to come to life. But with the glitter of Etched Bright with Sunlight, the final part of History, Pace - and his devoted audience - had completed a remarkable journey of discovery.",
