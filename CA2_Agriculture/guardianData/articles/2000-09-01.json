      "body": "<p>Growing numbers of desperate local education authorities are recruiting staff from the other side of the world this year to fill a record number of unfilled teaching jobs.</p> <p>More than 20 Australians will start work in schools in Croydon, south London, on Monday, with a further 15 expected to fly to Britain to fill posts before the year's end.</p> <p>The teachers were appointed through a recruitment drive dubbed Operation Kangaroo, in which four Croydon headteachers took the unusual step of flying to Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide to interview around 100 teachers over two weeks in July. It was a last ditch attempt to fill around 40 jobs which had remained vacant after several months.</p> <p>In a parallel move, nearby Greenwich, in south-east London, is scouring Canada and Australia for new recruits, and has not ruled out the prospect of looking in New Zealand, South Africa and parts of Europe. Similarly, Hackney, in east London, is looking in New Zealand, Australia and also, significantly, in Dubai and South Africa to boost the number of its ethnic minority teachers.</p> <p>Both Croydon and Greenwich councils used Britain's largest private recruitment company TimePlan, which has eight overseas offices, to overcome the problem of attracting applicants from this country. Any trips abroad are funded by TimePlan, solocal council taxpayers do not have to foot the bill.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said yesterday that TimePlan was currently seeking around 1,000 staff from overseas for long term postings in the UK. \"There is a great deal of interest in what we are doing,\" she said. \"We expect to announce further councils who are looking overseas in the next few weeks.\" By the time a council contacts TimePlan, it has usually exhausted other means of recruiting teachers.</p> <p><b> Fully qualified</b><br></p> <p>The Australian staff will be employed by the local education authorities on a supply basis for two terms, after which the schools are free to take on the teachers on their own pay scales.

Australian teachers are an attractive option for English schools as the two countries share a very similar curriculum at both primary and secondary level. The literacy hour is familiar to all Australian teachers and there is no language barrier.</p> <p>In Croydon, the 23 teachers were welcomed at a mayoral reception this week. They will teach subjects including English, drama, maths and science in 21 primary and secondary schools in the area.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Croydon council explained: \"We realised some time ago that we were struggling to attract applicants throughout the borough. The teachers have signed contracts to stay for a minimum of three terms and it has been agreed that if for any professional reason the teachers or heads are unhappy with the arrangement the teacher in question will be found a position in another school.</p> <p>\"During interviews we found many of the teachers found the idea of working so close to London a real attraction. They love the idea of teaching and getting the chance to see one of the world's most famous capitals at the same time.\"</p> <p>Councillor Lousia Woodley, Croydon council's education spokeswoman, said: \"We are delighted to have welcomed the first group of teachers from Australia. The recruitment programme has been extremely successful and has meant that our pupils will receive good quality education from qualified and experienced teachers from the start of the autumn term.</p> <p>\"We are currently working on an overall strategy for the borough which will address both the short term and the long term issues. Clearly we recognise that in some cases this project will not provide a long term solution but it will ensure that our pupils continue to receive good quality education from qualified and experienced teachers while a long term solution is found.\"</p> <p>Ironically, Australia also has a teacher shortage, along with the rest of the commonwealth and Europe. But many qualified Australian teachers recognise the value of a portable skill which they can take around the world to enhance their professional development.</p> <p>In Greenwich, the council is still looking to fill around 60 jobs, about 40 less than at the start of the summer term.</p> <p>\"We are hoping that in the short term, the recruitment drive in Canada at the beginning of August will fill most of these, and this will be followed by recruitment in Australia for January,\" a spokeswoman said. \"In the longer term the increased number of people joining the government's Graduate and Registered Teacher Programme and investment in part-time and returning teachers will increase the teachers available to the borough.</p> <p>Ralph Tabberer, chief executive of the Teacher Training Agency, said there was a valuable role for young teachers from the other side of the world, provided they met British standards. \"These are young, energetic people who can offer a different perspective on life in another country to our young people. Provided they are fully qualified, we don't have a problem with them at all.\"</p> <p>The deputy head of a Hackney secondary school said yesterday: \"We regularly use Australian teachers through supply agencies and we welcome them with open arms. They are lively and cheerful and the kids love them. They may be here primarily to see London but they also take their work extremely seriously, turning up with their own lesson plans and making sure they are doing what the school requires. It's easy to be disparaging about these youngsters but they are extremely on the ball.\"</p> <p><b> Record vacancies</b><br></p> <p>Official figures will be published next month showing that total teacher vacancies in January were 1,020 in London and a record 1,890 elsewhere in England, though many vacancies will have been filled since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>Applications for places on teacher training courses have risen markedly since the government announced the introduction of new \u00a36,000 training salaries for those starting postgraduate teaching courses this month, but colleges are still struggling to fill their places and are running at only 75% capacity.</p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"It is an absolute scandal that in the year 2000, an advanced industrial country like England should have to go to the old colonies to recruit teachers that we simply can't find from within our own resources because we don't give the profession the recognition it deserves.

Fully qualified The Australian staff will be employed by the local education authorities on a supply basis for two terms, after which the schools are free to take on the teachers on their own pay scales. They are only taken on if they are fully qualified, and take part in an induction programme before setting foot in the classroom. Most hold Australian bachelor of education qualifications and were interviewed at length about their teaching experience, knowledge of the curriculum and classroom management.

Applications for places on teacher training courses have risen markedly since the government announced the introduction of new \u00a36,000 training salaries for those starting postgraduate teaching courses this month, but colleges are still struggling to fill their places and are running at only 75% capacity. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"It is an absolute scandal that in the year 2000, an advanced industrial country like England should have to go to the old colonies to recruit teachers that we simply can't find from within our own resources because we don't give the profession the recognition it deserves.

The one-year contract could not have come at a better time for Lisa as it has enabled her to accompany her husband, who is about to start postgraduate studies at a London college.

      "bodyText": "Only two \"fresh start\" schools have improved their GCSE results this year - proof, the Conservatives claimed last night, that the scheme has failed. Three schools which saw their headteachers quit within five days of each other in March performed worse than last year. Firfield community school, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, had 4% of its pupils achieving five or more A*-Cs, compared with 9% last year. It is due to close next year. Results at East Brighton college of media arts fell from 20% to 13%, and Islington arts and media school, which reopened to a great fanfare after a \u00a34m refit, plummeted from 17% to 6%, even lower than the gloomy predictions of its governors. Under the fresh start programme, failing schools reopen with a new name and headteacher. There are currently 11 secondary schools and five primary schools in the scheme. Another nine are joining this term. Fir Vale school in Sheffield, visited by the education secretary, David Blunkett, last week, increased the number of candidates achieving five or more A*-Cs from 11% to 17%. Bishopsford in Morden, south London, boosted its results by one point. The top performing fresh start school, the Kings CE school in Wolverhampton, was bought by the church in 1998 and, though it had problems attracting pupils, did not have as poor a record on results in the first place. Theresa May, the shadow education secretary, said: \"Fresh start has been a failure right from the start.

      "body": "<p>AJP Taylor was a student in Vienna in 1933 when he was introduced to Margaret Adams, an English girl studying the piano. She came from a rich, upper-middle-class, Roman Catholic family - and had been educated in an English convent, from which she was attempting to emancipate herself. </p> <p>She was small, musical, with a yen for literature, although she was not intellectual, or at least not academic; as Taylor later - inaccurately - stated, \"no intellectual woman attracted me sexually\". They attended concerts together and fell in love. Taylor \"worried about the future, doubtful whether her religious or family background would consort with mine. She had no such doubts.\" </p> <p>He came back to England in 1930 to take up a post at Manchester university, but he had encouraged Margaret to return to Vienna to continue her piano studies: \"Being full of cranky ideas of marriage, concocted from the writings of Wells and Shaw,\" he wrote, \"I believed that every woman should have a career\", and something to do with the piano was apparently Margaret's destiny. It was also his way of putting off any decision. </p> <p>In 1931, Taylor moved to London to work on his first book. Margaret was also in London and, according to Taylor, \"it seemed to me that we must either marry or break. I was reluctant to do either.\" He decided to broach the question and Margaret agreed to marry him. They set up house in Manchester. Her passion for music had continued, and this formed a strong link between them. He had a subscription to the evening concerts of the Halle: now they both went. Margaret continued her studies; within a few years she was playing early music on the clavichord. She persuaded Philip Godlee, chairman of the Halle Orchestra, to start the Manchester Chamber Concerts Society. She was its secretary, and as a result of her determination, Manchester had the opportunity to hear all of the greatest quartets of the day. </p> <p>The couple's move to Oxford in 1938, to enable Taylor to take up a post as fellow and tutor in modern history at Magdalen College, deprived them of the music; and it also deprived Margaret of an absorbing avocation, with devastating results for the marriage. From mid-1940, Taylor's private life was pain and misery because of Margaret's infatuations, first with Robert Kee and then with Dylan Thomas; the eventual outcome was divorce. </p> <p>Taylor thought that the origin of Margaret's passion for Kee was a holiday in 1939. Taylor was 33, Margaret younger, their son Giles aged two. Kee, then 19, was handsome, desired by both sexes, by rumour experienced sexually, clever and interesting. He was one of Taylor's favourite undergraduates, and Taylor never blamed him for what happened. </p> <p>The historian took his family and their nanny, Henrietta Kotlan, to Savoy that summer and Kee was among the visitors who came to stay. Taylor worked every morning on his book The Habsburg Monarchy, while Margaret spent time with Kee. When they all took walks together, she and Kee strode ahead and were quickly out of sight. According to Kotlan, Margaret \"was already in love\" with Kee before the holiday: \"She was a very sweet, rather helpless creature with this falling in love all the time. But she couldn't help it... even I noticed that she lost interest in Giles.\" Taylor thought nothing of it, but when they returned to Oxford, things developed: he said \"Margaret was falling passionately, unrestrainedly in love\" with Kee. She harassed him in his lodgings, thrusting herself physically on him. </p> <p>Taylor eventually found out about her obsession. \"It puzzled me that Robert became increasingly reluctant to come to the house... One day, picking up the extension telephone in my room, I heard Robert say to Margaret: 'You know it is impossible for me to come to the theatre with you. I am sending the tickets back.' All became clear to me. I understood why Margaret hung about in the hall when she thought Robert might be coming to see me and why she grew listless at evening parties when he failed to appear.\" </p> <p>Kee left Oxford in 1940 to join the Royal Air Force and Margaret, distraught, followed him to his camp. She tried to make contact with him and he had to warn the guard against her, cowering in the camp until he was certain that she had left. He became a bomber pilot and was finally out of reach. Things settled down for the Taylors, but one evening they went to see the film Brief Encounter. Taylor later wrote he \"was speechless with agony and walked home feeling as though I were dead. Margaret merely complained that I was rather silent. It was the bitterest moment of my troubled life.\" </p> <p>Kee was shot down and became a prisoner of war. At Margaret's urging, Taylor wrote to him regularly, which he did \"more for his sake than for hers\". Things were still wrong, as Taylor discovered when there were signs that the war would soon be over. \"Margaret listened to every new bulletin on the wireless with passionate concentration. I realised she was thinking all the time of Robert. My hopes and illusions fell from me.\" </p> <p>In July 1945 Margaret asked to travel to London with her husband, only later revealing that Kee was back in the country and would be coming for a drink. \"We waited miserable and restless until after 10 when I went to bed. Robert appeared when I was already asleep. Margaret told Robert that our room was available for him if he wanted it. Nothing had changed. When I thought Margaret had been setting up the London room for me, she had been preparing it for Robert and planning all along for him to move in. Thus I lost both my London room and my peace of mind.\" </p> <p>Kee began to visit their house in Oxford. But Margaret was soon to be thrown over. When Kee invited the Taylors to dinner in London. He seemed restless, watching the restaurant door. Taylor remembered: \"Suddenly he said, 'Here she is' and introduced us to Janetta, already twice married and soon to marry Robert, who had soon wearied of [Margaret's] attentions. Time and again [she] tried to take Robert unawares. Robert complained to me. He complained to others and Margaret's infatuation became the common talk of Oxford, or so I thought. I felt humiliated and resentful. My last spark of affection for Margaret was extinguished.\" </p> <p> In the autumn of 1946, Dylan and Caitlin Thomas turned up on the Taylors' doorstep. Dylan had been an unwelcome visitor before, and Taylor disliked him intensely. He stayed for a month, not for just a week or two. He drank on a monumental scale, 15 or 20 pints of beer a day which created a problem: Taylor kept a barrel in the house and did not intend to provide a constant supply for Thomas, so he tried to ration him. They had little in common: they did not share any literary interests, and Thomas did not like walking. He was a sponger. When he left, he told Taylor that he had lost the return half of his railway ticket, which Taylor thought a lie, and asked Taylor to lend him a couple of pounds. Taylor recalled he said: \" 'I lend once and, unless repaid, once only.' Thomas did not repay the money. But this did not matter. I never expected to see Dylan again.\" </p> <p>But here he was, this time with a wife, Caitlin, perhaps even more rambunctious. They were homeless and Margaret took pity on them, letting them take up residence in the summerhouse in the garden. \"Dylan tried to borrow money from me, in which he did not succeed,\" said Taylor. \"Thomas would go off to London to give a radio talk and spend the fee on drink. Then there would be a row with Caitlin. Dylan would cajole her in a wheedling Welsh voice, and Caitlin would succumb.\" </p> <p>Margaret gave parties for them, introducing Thomas to literary circles around Oxford and even inducing Taylor to take him to dine at Magdalen High Table. Taylor records that he remarked to Caitlin that Margaret often appeared unbalanced, because she imagined that she was in love with Robert Kee. Caitlin's reply was: \"Oh, no. she makes out that now she is in love with Dylan.\" Taylor, not surprisingly, was depressed at the prospect that there would be no end to Margaret's infatuations. She grew more obsessed with Thomas, turning herself into his patroness and the Taylors ended up paying for the Thomases' accommodation until the poet's death in 1953. </p> <p>In the autumn of 1947, Margaret found Dylan and Caitlin the Manor House in South Leigh, 10 miles west of Oxford. According to Taylor, he paid about \u00a32,000 for it, on condition that Margaret stop giving them money (a condition she failed to fulfil) and that they paid rent (which they hardly ever did). They moved in in September. Margaret was pleased because its relative closeness meant that she could keep an eye on Thomas. She bicycled out frequently, as did Taylor; according to Thomas, writing to Caitlin, it was hell, with Margaret lecturing about art and Taylor making scenes on the road. Taylor was getting desperate. Reports reached him that Thomas \"was boasting around the Oxford pubs that he had got the wife of a rich don hooked\". </p> <p>Margaret had inherited money when her mother died in 1941. She spent some of it on pictures: a Sickert, a Degas, a Renoir, a Utrillo. They began to disappear along with crystal decanters and the piano. \"I might not have minded so much if it had not been for Dylan's boasting,\" recalled Taylor. The composer Elizabeth Lutyens was supposed to have heard Thomas say: \"I'll have to see if I can squeeze Maggie's left breast and get some money.\" </p> <p>By May 1948 the Thomases were tired of South Leigh: Thomas had convinced himself that he could only write good poetry if he once again lived in South Wales. Margaret had to agree. According to a friend of Caitlin, Margaret had \"visions of returning with them, and setting up a threesome\". Caitlin claimed that Margaret wrote to Thomas that \"going to bed with you would be like going to bed with a god\". Thomas had originally encouraged Margaret to write verse, sending her long critiques, seeming to take it seriously. Later he was cruel. According to Caitlin, \"she and Dylan were standing in a bar, laughing about poor old Maggs behind her back, when they realised she was there, listening to them, the tears streaming down her mortified face\". </p> <p>After the couple moved to Wales, Caitlin wrote to a friend about a visit from Margaret: \"It ended as usual, with floods of tears and recriminations, and heliotrope changes of colour, on the main street, on a Sunday, after a few harsh words of truth from Dylan. And she had been so sweet and diplomatic until then. Ebie [Williams, a taxi driver] was simply terrified taking her to the station, clutching a basket of spilling underclothes, and soiled intimacies, her blue hair straggling wildly over her face, her lipstick streaking dangerously down her neck; and the wail of a lost banshee pursuing him to the ends of the earth.\" </p> <p>The house was the Boat House at Laugharne, which Thomas had coveted in his youth. When it came on the market, Margaret sold the Manor House, and with the proceeds bought it for \u00a33,000, two-thirds of her remaining capital, plus a further \u00a3136 for repairs to the roof and verandah. In 1949 the Thomases moved in. They were supposed to pay rent, although it was difficult for Margaret to extract it; that scene described by Caitlin took place after Margaret insisted that they pay her \u00a32 a week for seven years. </p> <p>Taylor was fed up. He wrote to Thomas that he was destroying their marriage and that he should lay off, if only for the sake of the children; Thomas never replied. With Kee, Margaret had sometimes been away for days; now it was happening again. Taylor recalled that often, coming back from London to their Oxford home, \"I found Holywell Ford deserted except for the children and our resident domestic\". Mar garet had broken her promise not to give the Thomases money: Taylor was intensely unhappy about that. </p> <p>It is unknown to what extent Margaret's passions were consummated. Taylor referred later to her \"wild love affairs\"; but he always said that Kee acted honourably, while Caitlin's temper and ferocious possessiveness would have led her to attack Margaret had she suspected that Margaret and Thomas were sleeping together. </p> <p>By 1950, Taylor decided that they should separate. He had asked for, and received, the promise of a sabbatical, which he proposed to spend in London, researching and writing The Struggle For Mastery In Europe. Margaret had suggested that Taylor should lease a house near Regent's Park in London and let their house in Oxford.The Taylors spent the whole summer in Oxford, \"enjoying a family life at Holywell Ford for perhaps the last time . . . we packed up and moved to Park Village East. I settled Margaret in her house there and moved to a flat elsewhere. This was the end of my full family life for many years to come.\"</p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from Troublemaker: The Life and History of AJP Taylor by Kathleen Burk is published by Yale University Press at \u00a319.95.

      "body": "<p>Tell a story about Jeanette Winterson. Once there was a girl with a gift. This girl sprang from nowhere. Nowhere taught few niceties to its daughters, and the journey elsewhere had made her tough, so when her gift drew fame and fortune she couldn't respond in the proper way. She wasn't grateful. She was proud. And worst of all, she loved her gift so intensely that she made the mistake of assuming others would love it for its own sake. Instead, they burned her. </p> <p>Begin again. Once there was a girl with an ego. She made a fuss about where she came from (this girl was working class). She believed her writing could save the world (this girl was a megalomaniac). In fact, it was pretentious and undisciplined (this girl called herself an artist). She was cruel, controlling and sexually manipulative (this girl was a lesbian). And as her work sagged with self-indulgence, the ego became more monstrous still, until she burnt out. </p> <p>Tell a truth about Jeanette Winterson. She doesn't foster indifference. But the truth is many-minded, and the easiest facts mislead. Where does she end and the story around her begin? How does reputation happen? </p> <p>\"It's no secret that the 90s weren't a great decade for me, so maybe that's why I'm glad they're gone,\" says Winterson, neat and tiny in the parlour of the east London house she renovated from derelict, and which remains her occasional city base.</p> <p>\"If you come through that with your joy returned to you... \" the phrase tangles, and she pauses. It's jarring - she normally speaks demandingly swiftly, in complete and perfectly grammatical sentences. The period she is describing with such elliptical rawness followed the publication of Art And Lies, her sixth novel, in 1994. Almost a decade after the rapturous reception of her debut, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, in 1985, the primacy of Winterson's image was swiftly outflanking her own modernist agenda of the primacy of the text. The evangelical fervour of her childhood, which she used as a basis for Oranges, had transmuted into an absurd, messianic self-belief in adulthood, it was said. </p> <p>The exuberance and experimentalism of The Passion (1987) and Sexing The Cherry (1989) were soon subsumed within her own weighty prophesies. In the 1991 introduction to Orange's reissue with publishers Vintage, she dismissed the notion that hers was straightforward semi-autobiography: \"[it is] an experimental novel: its interests are anti-linear. It offers a complicated narrative structure disguised as a simple one, it employs a very large vocabulary and a beguilingly straightforward syntax... Oranges is a threatening novel.\" Meanwhile, she was demanding chauffeur-driven transport on book tours, and declaring herself the natural heir to Virginia Woolf in a Late Show special on TV. </p> <p>She next told a tabloid interviewer that the relationship in 1992's Written On The Body was based on her own affair with her married agent, outing the woman in question. She then nominated that book as her Book Of The Year in a Sunday newspaper, and the following year nominated herself as her favourite living author. She \"sacked\" a close friend, apparently because she felt that her high-profile position in the media was corrupting her. </p> <p>Having left her British agent, she formed her own company to look after her UK interests, and surrounded herself with a \"coven\" of close female friends, including her partner, the broadcaster and academic Margaret Reynolds, who left her husband for Winterson. In 1994, following the publication of Art And Lies, she doorstepped a journalist who had written a critical profile of her, in which she suggested that her splendid isolation was affecting her writing.</p> <p>She was outrageous; her sins writ large, time and again, from the monolith of the cuttings file, ego without irony, action without context. Nor was she safely outrageous. Winterson may have invited a sharp response with her swank and insensitivity, but the judgment that followed bit far deeper - at her eccentric lifestyle, her sexuality, her unfeminine choices, her humourless determination to take her work seriously. The backlash was ferocious, her next two fiction works greeted with blanket hostility and ridicule. </p> <p>\"It's one of the reasons I left London [to live in Gloucestershire full-time, in 1994]. I wanted to retreat completely and find a different space for myself. It was a moment of transition, when I said, 'Am I going to go on, can I go on, is there any point going on?' And I thought I wouldn't for about two years. I couldn't write anything, couldn't do anything. I just carried on doing the only thing I could think of, which was reading books, listening to opera and going to look at pictures. I thought, 'This will heal me. I have my own medicine, and if I really believe in this as much as I say I do, I'll just have to wait for it to change its course.'\" </p> <p>She doesn't blame other people, she says evenly. \"I'm responsible as much as the press are. By the time the early 90s came, I'd done three books, won a Bafta, been published all over the world - there was bound to be trouble, and I didn't handle it well. I shouldn't have got as angry as I did. Criticism is not personal, it happens to everyone, but I didn't understand that. It keyed into all my own insecurities and anxieties, thinking that I shouldn't be here, this isn't what I'm meant for. Then, to defend yourself against that, you get caught in a kind of arrogance that says, 'No I am good enough, just fuck off.' You get very angry and defensive. I had a lot of rows with people.\" </p> <p>Begin again. \"I feel I've been waiting for the 21st century all my life.\" At the age of 41, Winterson - never knowingly lukewarm - hails cyberspace with a zealot's tongue. \"It feels exciting, risky, it just feels new. I love the web. I love email, I like the swiftness of it. It's always been an irritation to me that you can't communicate as swiftly as you can think. I love the thought that there are no obvious barriers between us, and I like the pretence of it.\" </p> <p>Winterson recently won a ruling against a Cambridge academic who had registered her domain name and those of other authors on the internet, and plans to launch her own website, in conjunction with the publication of her new novel, The.PowerBook.</p> <p>\"The domain name business was like being taken by the scruff of the neck and forced into a serious learning curve,\" she says. \"I've always had the philosophy, because it's been true for me, that no matter how bad a thing is, some good will come out of it for yourself. If it hadn't happened, maybe I'd have been slower on the uptake. Where it will end, I don't know. I imagine I'll probably do everything on it eventually.\" Is it easier to dissemble in cyberspace? \"Oh yes!\" She twists her adolescent frame around the chair excitedly. Dressed in black and white, with wire hair and fussless face, she is less mannish than femininity-free. \"The potential for trouble is high,\" she adds with relish. \"But also I think the sense of the expanding self is exciting, the thought that you're not locked into the way you look, the way you talk, your social position, even your gender. You can play with all those things in a way that can be quite liberating.\" </p> <p>The.PowerBook does just that. The story of an e-writing lover and her (married) lass, it is threaded with Winterson's usual high concerns - the nature of time, love and gender, the knightly quest for the grail and the journey that maps it - but pulls back from the grandiose involution of her recent work. Hyper-eloquence at bay, her lean reworkings of Written On The Body and Oranges anchor denser references to TS Eliot, Woolf and Dante, while fluent contemporary characterisation balances archetype. Language remains beloved, but is no longer fetishised. </p> <p> The.PowerBook, she says, brings together everything she has done so far: the story and the language, the linear and the multiple. \"I'm trying to do it all, and nobody can, but I don't mind. I don't want to read a page of print which is really just printed television, or where the words aren't doing the work.\" This is her journey. \"I love 19th century fiction, but I don't want to read reproductions. If we're not moving fiction forward, we're not doing anything with it. And if art's not moving forward, it ceases to be connected to the past. You have to risk failing. Nobody expects science to stay in the same place, but everybody moans like fuck when people start doing new things in art.\" </p> <p>There is no such thing as autobiography, she wrote in a previous novel, there's only art and lies. What's the difference? \"I believe in art as the true means of not telling the truth. You're not setting out to deceive. You're setting out to find an ultimate reality. Lies are just lies. They're deceptions that you create for yourself or others, and most of us live our life in a lie from beginning to end, because it's comfortable. What art tries to do is cut through all that and come up with something that really is objective, and which is trying all at once to deal with the mundane tables-and-chairs world of the everyday and also with imaginative and psychic worlds which we know are there and which we so often split off. </p> <p>\"I try not to tell lies to people I love, and I try not to tell lies where it matters, but I will sacrifice a fair bit of fact if I can tell a good story,\" she laughs. \"It's being lashed to facts that I'm not interested in. I want the elbow room. It's not just the stories you make up yourself, it's the stories people make up about you. Never mind being a character in your own book, you become a character in your own life. All of that you weave in yourself, and you stop minding about it. I've come to see the whole thing now as one giant story, which I'm sometimes in control of but mostly not.\" </p> <p>Life's the messy bit, she says, art is where we have the chance of getting it right. Experience through art is as important as anything that happens in life. In The.PowerBook, a storyteller weaves himself into his stories: \"What he is, what he invents, becomes part of the same story...\" Does she filter her own life through her writing? \"I do. Otherwise [the emotions] are in an inchoate condition where they're not much use to me and they're certainly no use to anybody else. It's only by endlessly filtering and refining, like pushing water through limestone to extract the impurities, that you're left with the emotion which then becomes useful to other people as well as to yourself.\" Art and life, she says, are completely intertwined. </p> <p>But whose life? While she accepts that art is not classless, she appears to be more concerned with the effort people make with it than the access they have to it. And she demands that effort from those who read her, as well as their submission. Nothing has changed since the tease she set down in her third novel, The Passion: \"I'm telling you stories. Trust me.\"</p> <p>Winterson is often accused of showing contempt for her readers and, by extension, contempt for the ordinary, of lacking imaginative empathy with the everyday, and preferring to explore her own rarefied vision than the world around her. She doesn't like it when people don't try, she responds. \"I'm not interested in laziness, sloppiness, or bad manners. Sometimes that makes people cross. But I really care about this art business. I can't take it anything but seriously. It's everything to me. But I have no contempt for ordinary people. I'm not a middle-class wanker. I've made myself into what I am, because it's what I wanted to be. I am convinced that if anyone wants to make that effort, then all these things are as open to them as they are to me.\" It's rigidly Old Testament, as well as deeply Thatcherite. It also exhibits a strange kind of generosity for a woman so self-consciously self-made. </p> <p>She tells me later that she voted for Thatcher in 1979, when she had just been accepted to Oxford University. \"She really believed that everyone could pull themselves together if they were given the opportunity. I'd just got into Oxford, and I thought, 'Of course, working-class kid gets in, it'll all be like this now.' But I don't think that now,\" she acknowledges, contradicting her earlier brimstone on the primacy of effort. (This happens a couple of times during our conversation, when she gets carried away with the joy of a thought, a delicious yarn, or a fervent rant, and dances over rigour. Or is she just teasing the truth?) She now accepts that ability also plays its part in achievement. \"But I still don't think that's any excuse for general laziness,\" she nips. </p> <p>Naturally, she is ambitious for her work, she says. \"I want it to be really good. I have to be able to hold my head up, I have to feel that I'm doing the very best that I can. It doesn't matter to me how other people think it measures up. You have to set those high standards. You have to care about it.\" Later in the conversation, she adds that it will be another 20 years before anyone can judge whether her work is worthwhile. \"If it's good, it'll last the course, if it's not good, let it go. I think that the work I'm doing is making a difference, but in the end everybody else has got to be the judge of that.\" Is this another reckless contradiction, or does she trust the judgment of the future more than that of the present? \"I'll be satisfied. It's worked for me. This is the life I wanted. I'm very lucky. I don't know what it'll look like in the end, but I intend to live a very long time so I can see. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I feel I've done something really good and I'm pleased,\" she says. \"Other times I look at it and I can see all the gaps but I can't do anything about it. I'm pleased with The.PowerBook. It was hard to do, and it fulfils the goals that I set for myself.\" She trails off. \"I hate talking about this because people always misinterpret it as vanity.\" </p> <p>Would you like her to be simply vain? Can you hear the phrases stressed with vulnerability as clearly as those delivered with swagger? She loves words. Her love is ruthless, romantic, not nice. It is complex, and so is she. </p> <p> Born near Manchester, in 1959, Winterson was the adopted daughter and only child of Elim Pentecostalists, a fringe evangelical church which teaches every word of the Bible to be literally true. Her father was a factory worker, her mother a housewife, who raised the young Jeanette to be a missionary. Her extraordinary childhood - culturally void, emotionally sterile, obscenely Godly - forms the basis of the Whitbread Prize-winning Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, which she later adapted for the BBC. At the age of 16, she was publicly denounced by her church after they discovered that she was having a lesbian affair. She left home, took A-levels at a local technical college, and supported herself doing odd jobs, before going to St Catherine's College, Oxford, to study English. </p> <p>The portrait of her adoptive mother in Oranges is neither cruel nor kind, it is loveless but tempered with an odd, accommodating respect. When I ask a question about her mother, I am immediately corrected. \"Mrs Winterson?\" She stares at me, daring shock. She has vivid eyes. \"It was never going to work between us. I don't know what fate put me with her, or her with me, but at least I was able to use all that and make something of it. Whereas for her it was just purgatory. She was a very unhappy woman. And I was a happy child. In a way, the battle between us was the battle between happiness and unhappiness.\"</p> <p>The language is clean, disconnected. The woman who brought her up is character, translated into archetype, and not felt. Mrs Winterson, estranged from Jeanette since she left home, died soon after the television screening of Oranges. She was reportedly devastated by the portrayal of her daughter's childhood. Does Winterson feel any guilt for that now? \"No,\" lobs back, with teenage challenge. Nor does she regret hurting her adoptive father, with whom she continues to correspond occasionally. \"You can't have regrets. I wanted it to be made, and I think it's good, and you can't not do things because one person's not going to like it. That would be ruthlessness I suppose. </p> <p>\"But also, remember one of the things she was particularly miffed about was that she thought it was all not true, but I never said it was true anyway.\" She laughs at her cleverness. It's an ugly moment. \"Oranges isn't autobiography. It's a way of using yourself and the past to create a fiction around all of that. When Paul Auster and Milan Kundera put themselves in their work it's called metafiction, when I do it it's autobiography.\" Art and life, completely intertwined. In the circumstances, I doubt if Mrs Winterson cared about metafiction. Art and life, a literary term in the feelings gap. </p> <p>The Wintersons, or their metafictitious representations, resurface in The.PowerBook as Mr and Mrs Muck, the parents of the narrator. The passages detailing their relationship have none of the diverting bravado of Oranges. They are flayed raw. \"I stopped being angry a long time ago,\" she says. \"But it's all still there. When I was writing stuff in The.Powerbook, I was a bit surprised. It had to come out.\" Her buttery Lancashire vowels draw tight. \"It was about settling an old score as well. Oranges had become so mythologised, even to the absurd point where people would say how lucky I was to have such a childhood. I needed to write something one more time about the particular kind of pain that was there.\" </p> <p>In the new novel, she also writes achingly for the first time about her birth mother. \"I was working in Cornwall at the time, I had a high fever and I was on my own. All this stuff was coming up, and I thought, 'You can let go of this.' And it was letting everything go. It was from that time, in March 1999, that I really felt the bad period [since Art And Lies] was over. That was the end of it. The fever went, I got up, wrote all that stuff down much as you read it now. I thought, 'Good, I think I've got to the bottom of the heap here', and went home.\" </p> <p>She has never attempted to contact her birth mother. \"It would be a huge mistake. She made the choice she did. I've been in the public eye, and she knows what my name is. Some things are over before they start. Family life is a bit of a mystery to me. I don't understand it. I have no experience of such feelings, so I'm pretty sure I haven't got them. Clearly, family life isn't for me. Maybe it's what keeps me focused, and in the early days what kept me ruthless. Because you have to be ruthless to fight your way up. I didn't have to worry about anyone. I didn't feel I owed anybody anything. Once I left home, I thought, 'I'm on my own, I always have been in effect, and now I have to get on with it and make it happen.'\" </p> <p>There is human sadness here, no matter how she words it as indifference. There is ugliness and randomness that she will re-write as beauty and control, for herself, for her readers. What could family life have taught her? Without the lesson, she writes for belonging, for certainties, to make herself new and to keep herself all her own work. </p> <p>Yet, despite this uncharacteristic deferral to circumstance, her emotional life is hardly void. Her friends all employ the same descriptives: difficult, loyal, worth it. \"I give a lot, but I demand a lot,\" says Winterson. \"I suppose because I never had a family as such, my friends are my family. So all the things you would expect in a family circle, where people really go at it but know that they really love each other, is what happens to me with my friends. I've lost friends, there are some that I regret and that are totally my fault. There have been times in my life when I've just wanted everything different, and I've walked away. And that's hard.\" </p> <p>What violence must that singular quest for renewal do to softer hearts? In Winterson legend, sexually she was ever the Casanova, particularly where married women were concerned. She is not a pretty thing, nor is she superficially flirtatious, but one can imagine the force of her, the desire to be drawn into her, must be compulsive. </p> <p> There is a yarn about Winterson involving saucepans. In 1997, to much attendant media moistness, she divulged that, when she first arrived in London as a boyish twentysomething, she serviced frustrated married women from the Home Counties in hotel rooms off Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. Having minimal access to the hard stuff, they paid her in Le Creuset. </p> <p>The hilarity - of the story, of the telling of the story - tickles her still. \" That was funny. It got blown up out of all proportion, but it was such a good story!\" The kernel is true, she concedes, before adding, tantalisingly, \"and I do have an awful lot of pans. Even now, if we get a big one with risotto stuck to the bottom, I say to Peggy, 'You've no idea how hard I had to work for that, and look what you've done to it...' - and I get biffed. It got all dressed up as lesbian prostitution, which it really wasn't. It was simply to do with a very strange and particular time which couldn't happen now, with ladies leading double lives. I was very young. They just wanted to buy me presents, and I needed cookware.\" </p> <p>As in her art, so in her life, married women have appeared frequently. \"I've always had a strange attraction to and for them. I think it's a kind of pleasure and danger thing.\" Did it stem from a fear of involvement on her part? There is no lover so tempting to the commitment-phobe as the already-partnered partner. \"No, I hate it. I mind subterfuge. I made it clear to Peggy that I couldn't get involved with her while she was married [the pair have now been together for 11 years]. She had to leave for her own reasons, and I wasn't promising to be there. Which is a bit brutal, but I'd had enough of all that. Peggy left and found me again. I thought that was incredibly brave and completely honest. It's actually the only proper way to proceed.\" </p> <p>Her sense of the proper is endearing, her lust for control confronting. She sets up the sexual, and therefore gendered, choices in her life like ladder rungs. \"Kids don't leave home at 16 because they've fallen in love with another girl. That's a big either/or choice. But I wanted that more than I wanted any of the other things that were on offer. I don't put stability and comfort very high up the list anyway, they're not worth sacrificing anything for. So I suppose I became a conscious sexual being, thinking I'd made a choice for another person that I desired early on, and that continued, because it was a way of understanding myself and who I was, and of laying claim to the world. It was about power, but not about power over other people. I wanted power over myself, and I used sex to find that. It told me who I was in a very straightforward way. I went through boys, girls, at random and whenever I could, because I just thought the more the better.\" </p> <p>Lesbianism is another choice, she tells me. \"It's very fashionable at the moment to say that everything is genetic, but it's a choice that I made quite consciously. I don't have any problems going to bed with men, don't dislike it, don't dislike them. I could choose, and with women I was able to get on with my life and do my work, and I'm not sure that I would have been able to do that if I'd been heterosexual. I feel like I didn't make a problem for myself, I made a solution. I knew I never wanted any kids. It would take up all my time because I would have to do it properly. </p> <p>\"Femininity is a construct,\" she continues, \"and I don't trust it. I think it's still difficult for women to be themselves in the way that men can, without any regard for what's happening around them. There is still that self-consciousness in women, that they are women, which is hampering. It's very difficult to do good work if you're self-conscious. It's not arrogance, it's straightforward single-mindedness, which people accept in men.\" </p> <p>Tell a truth about Jeanette Winterson. She divides like Moses and the Red Sea. Phoning round for context before I met her, I had never encountered such definitives: a sociopath, a seducer, fiercely loyal, impossibly demanding, a bitch, a blessing. For so many certainties, she must be a mystery. I was warned: she'll flirt, she'll charm, she'll give you what you want.</p> <p>So who did I meet? A brilliant child, compelling and easily bored, who one is moved to protect. A woman for whom self is absolute, keen and knowingly dissembling, who has found her place of safety behind the words. No comfort, no coward. She must be a bugger to love. She's probably worth it. Older now, more even, she is delighted by her life: her horses and her haybales, country domesticity and her beautiful woman, though she teases that she may take a mistress in the future \"now that the 40s are the new 30s\". She'll never know when to stop.</p> <p>In The PowerBook, she writes: \"In this life you have to be your own hero. By that I mean you have to win whatever it is that matters to you by your own strength and in your own way.\"</p> <p>Tell a story about Jeanette Winterson.

      "bodyText": "Tell a story about Jeanette Winterson. Once there was a girl with a gift. This girl sprang from nowhere. Nowhere taught few niceties to its daughters, and the journey elsewhere had made her tough, so when her gift drew fame and fortune she couldn't respond in the proper way. She wasn't grateful. She was proud. And worst of all, she loved her gift so intensely that she made the mistake of assuming others would love it for its own sake. Instead, they burned her. Begin again. Once there was a girl with an ego. She made a fuss about where she came from (this girl was working class). She believed her writing could save the world (this girl was a megalomaniac). In fact, it was pretentious and undisciplined (this girl called herself an artist). She was cruel, controlling and sexually manipulative (this girl was a lesbian). And as her work sagged with self-indulgence, the ego became more monstrous still, until she burnt out. Tell a truth about Jeanette Winterson. She doesn't foster indifference. But the truth is many-minded, and the easiest facts mislead. Where does she end and the story around her begin? How does reputation happen? \"It's no secret that the 90s weren't a great decade for me, so maybe that's why I'm glad they're gone,\" says Winterson, neat and tiny in the parlour of the east London house she renovated from derelict, and which remains her occasional city base. \"If you come through that with your joy returned to you... \" the phrase tangles, and she pauses. It's jarring - she normally speaks demandingly swiftly, in complete and perfectly grammatical sentences. The period she is describing with such elliptical rawness followed the publication of Art And Lies, her sixth novel, in 1994. Almost a decade after the rapturous reception of her debut, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, in 1985, the primacy of Winterson's image was swiftly outflanking her own modernist agenda of the primacy of the text. The evangelical fervour of her childhood, which she used as a basis for Oranges, had transmuted into an absurd, messianic self-belief in adulthood, it was said. The exuberance and experimentalism of The Passion (1987) and Sexing The Cherry (1989) were soon subsumed within her own weighty prophesies. In the 1991 introduction to Orange's reissue with publishers Vintage, she dismissed the notion that hers was straightforward semi-autobiography: \"[it is] an experimental novel: its interests are anti-linear. It offers a complicated narrative structure disguised as a simple one, it employs a very large vocabulary and a beguilingly straightforward syntax... Oranges is a threatening novel.\" Meanwhile, she was demanding chauffeur-driven transport on book tours, and declaring herself the natural heir to Virginia Woolf in a Late Show special on TV. She next told a tabloid interviewer that the relationship in 1992's Written On The Body was based on her own affair with her married agent, outing the woman in question. She then nominated that book as her Book Of The Year in a Sunday newspaper, and the following year nominated herself as her favourite living author. She \"sacked\" a close friend, apparently because she felt that her high-profile position in the media was corrupting her. Having left her British agent, she formed her own company to look after her UK interests, and surrounded herself with a \"coven\" of close female friends, including her partner, the broadcaster and academic Margaret Reynolds, who left her husband for Winterson. In 1994, following the publication of Art And Lies, she doorstepped a journalist who had written a critical profile of her, in which she suggested that her splendid isolation was affecting her writing. She was outrageous; her sins writ large, time and again, from the monolith of the cuttings file, ego without irony, action without context. Nor was she safely outrageous. Winterson may have invited a sharp response with her swank and insensitivity, but the judgment that followed bit far deeper - at her eccentric lifestyle, her sexuality, her unfeminine choices, her humourless determination to take her work seriously. The backlash was ferocious, her next two fiction works greeted with blanket hostility and ridicule. \"It's one of the reasons I left London [to live in Gloucestershire full-time, in 1994]. I wanted to retreat completely and find a different space for myself. It was a moment of transition, when I said, 'Am I going to go on, can I go on, is there any point going on?' And I thought I wouldn't for about two years. I couldn't write anything, couldn't do anything. I just carried on doing the only thing I could think of, which was reading books, listening to opera and going to look at pictures. I thought, 'This will heal me. I have my own medicine, and if I really believe in this as much as I say I do, I'll just have to wait for it to change its course.'\" She doesn't blame other people, she says evenly. \"I'm responsible as much as the press are. By the time the early 90s came, I'd done three books, won a Bafta, been published all over the world - there was bound to be trouble, and I didn't handle it well. I shouldn't have got as angry as I did. Criticism is not personal, it happens to everyone, but I didn't understand that. It keyed into all my own insecurities and anxieties, thinking that I shouldn't be here, this isn't what I'm meant for. Then, to defend yourself against that, you get caught in a kind of arrogance that says, 'No I am good enough, just fuck off.' You get very angry and defensive. I had a lot of rows with people.\" Begin again. \"I feel I've been waiting for the 21st century all my life.\" At the age of 41, Winterson - never knowingly lukewarm - hails cyberspace with a zealot's tongue. \"It feels exciting, risky, it just feels new. I love the web. I love email, I like the swiftness of it. It's always been an irritation to me that you can't communicate as swiftly as you can think. I love the thought that there are no obvious barriers between us, and I like the pretence of it.\" Winterson recently won a ruling against a Cambridge academic who had registered her domain name and those of other authors on the internet, and plans to launch her own website, in conjunction with the publication of her new novel, The.PowerBook. \"The domain name business was like being taken by the scruff of the neck and forced into a serious learning curve,\" she says. \"I've always had the philosophy, because it's been true for me, that no matter how bad a thing is, some good will come out of it for yourself. If it hadn't happened, maybe I'd have been slower on the uptake. Where it will end, I don't know. I imagine I'll probably do everything on it eventually.\" Is it easier to dissemble in cyberspace? \"Oh yes!\" She twists her adolescent frame around the chair excitedly. Dressed in black and white, with wire hair and fussless face, she is less mannish than femininity-free. \"The potential for trouble is high,\" she adds with relish. \"But also I think the sense of the expanding self is exciting, the thought that you're not locked into the way you look, the way you talk, your social position, even your gender. You can play with all those things in a way that can be quite liberating.\" The.PowerBook does just that. The story of an e-writing lover and her (married) lass, it is threaded with Winterson's usual high concerns - the nature of time, love and gender, the knightly quest for the grail and the journey that maps it - but pulls back from the grandiose involution of her recent work. Hyper-eloquence at bay, her lean reworkings of Written On The Body and Oranges anchor denser references to TS Eliot, Woolf and Dante, while fluent contemporary characterisation balances archetype. Language remains beloved, but is no longer fetishised. The.PowerBook, she says, brings together everything she has done so far: the story and the language, the linear and the multiple. \"I'm trying to do it all, and nobody can, but I don't mind. I don't want to read a page of print which is really just printed television, or where the words aren't doing the work.\" This is her journey. \"I love 19th century fiction, but I don't want to read reproductions. If we're not moving fiction forward, we're not doing anything with it. And if art's not moving forward, it ceases to be connected to the past. You have to risk failing. Nobody expects science to stay in the same place, but everybody moans like fuck when people start doing new things in art.\" There is no such thing as autobiography, she wrote in a previous novel, there's only art and lies. What's the difference? \"I believe in art as the true means of not telling the truth. You're not setting out to deceive. You're setting out to find an ultimate reality. Lies are just lies. They're deceptions that you create for yourself or others, and most of us live our life in a lie from beginning to end, because it's comfortable. What art tries to do is cut through all that and come up with something that really is objective, and which is trying all at once to deal with the mundane tables-and-chairs world of the everyday and also with imaginative and psychic worlds which we know are there and which we so often split off. \"I try not to tell lies to people I love, and I try not to tell lies where it matters, but I will sacrifice a fair bit of fact if I can tell a good story,\" she laughs. \"It's being lashed to facts that I'm not interested in. I want the elbow room. It's not just the stories you make up yourself, it's the stories people make up about you. Never mind being a character in your own book, you become a character in your own life. All of that you weave in yourself, and you stop minding about it. I've come to see the whole thing now as one giant story, which I'm sometimes in control of but mostly not.\" Life's the messy bit, she says, art is where we have the chance of getting it right. Experience through art is as important as anything that happens in life. In The.PowerBook, a storyteller weaves himself into his stories: \"What he is, what he invents, becomes part of the same story...\" Does she filter her own life through her writing? \"I do. Otherwise [the emotions] are in an inchoate condition where they're not much use to me and they're certainly no use to anybody else. It's only by endlessly filtering and refining, like pushing water through limestone to extract the impurities, that you're left with the emotion which then becomes useful to other people as well as to yourself.\" Art and life, she says, are completely intertwined. But whose life? While she accepts that art is not classless, she appears to be more concerned with the effort people make with it than the access they have to it. And she demands that effort from those who read her, as well as their submission. Nothing has changed since the tease she set down in her third novel, The Passion: \"I'm telling you stories. Trust me.\" Winterson is often accused of showing contempt for her readers and, by extension, contempt for the ordinary, of lacking imaginative empathy with the everyday, and preferring to explore her own rarefied vision than the world around her. She doesn't like it when people don't try, she responds. \"I'm not interested in laziness, sloppiness, or bad manners. Sometimes that makes people cross. But I really care about this art business. I can't take it anything but seriously. It's everything to me. But I have no contempt for ordinary people. I'm not a middle-class wanker. I've made myself into what I am, because it's what I wanted to be. I am convinced that if anyone wants to make that effort, then all these things are as open to them as they are to me.\" It's rigidly Old Testament, as well as deeply Thatcherite. It also exhibits a strange kind of generosity for a woman so self-consciously self-made. She tells me later that she voted for Thatcher in 1979, when she had just been accepted to Oxford University. \"She really believed that everyone could pull themselves together if they were given the opportunity. I'd just got into Oxford, and I thought, 'Of course, working-class kid gets in, it'll all be like this now.' But I don't think that now,\" she acknowledges, contradicting her earlier brimstone on the primacy of effort. (This happens a couple of times during our conversation, when she gets carried away with the joy of a thought, a delicious yarn, or a fervent rant, and dances over rigour. Or is she just teasing the truth?) She now accepts that ability also plays its part in achievement. \"But I still don't think that's any excuse for general laziness,\" she nips. Naturally, she is ambitious for her work, she says. \"I want it to be really good. I have to be able to hold my head up, I have to feel that I'm doing the very best that I can. It doesn't matter to me how other people think it measures up. You have to set those high standards. You have to care about it.\" Later in the conversation, she adds that it will be another 20 years before anyone can judge whether her work is worthwhile. \"If it's good, it'll last the course, if it's not good, let it go. I think that the work I'm doing is making a difference, but in the end everybody else has got to be the judge of that.\" Is this another reckless contradiction, or does she trust the judgment of the future more than that of the present? \"I'll be satisfied. It's worked for me. This is the life I wanted. I'm very lucky. I don't know what it'll look like in the end, but I intend to live a very long time so I can see. \"Sometimes I feel I've done something really good and I'm pleased,\" she says. \"Other times I look at it and I can see all the gaps but I can't do anything about it. I'm pleased with The.PowerBook. It was hard to do, and it fulfils the goals that I set for myself.\" She trails off. \"I hate talking about this because people always misinterpret it as vanity.\" Would you like her to be simply vain? Can you hear the phrases stressed with vulnerability as clearly as those delivered with swagger? She loves words. Her love is ruthless, romantic, not nice. It is complex, and so is she. Born near Manchester, in 1959, Winterson was the adopted daughter and only child of Elim Pentecostalists, a fringe evangelical church which teaches every word of the Bible to be literally true. Her father was a factory worker, her mother a housewife, who raised the young Jeanette to be a missionary. Her extraordinary childhood - culturally void, emotionally sterile, obscenely Godly - forms the basis of the Whitbread Prize-winning Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, which she later adapted for the BBC. At the age of 16, she was publicly denounced by her church after they discovered that she was having a lesbian affair. She left home, took A-levels at a local technical college, and supported herself doing odd jobs, before going to St Catherine's College, Oxford, to study English. The portrait of her adoptive mother in Oranges is neither cruel nor kind, it is loveless but tempered with an odd, accommodating respect. When I ask a question about her mother, I am immediately corrected. \"Mrs Winterson?\" She stares at me, daring shock. She has vivid eyes. \"It was never going to work between us. I don't know what fate put me with her, or her with me, but at least I was able to use all that and make something of it. Whereas for her it was just purgatory. She was a very unhappy woman. And I was a happy child. In a way, the battle between us was the battle between happiness and unhappiness.\" The language is clean, disconnected. The woman who brought her up is character, translated into archetype, and not felt. Mrs Winterson, estranged from Jeanette since she left home, died soon after the television screening of Oranges. She was reportedly devastated by the portrayal of her daughter's childhood. Does Winterson feel any guilt for that now? \"No,\" lobs back, with teenage challenge. Nor does she regret hurting her adoptive father, with whom she continues to correspond occasionally. \"You can't have regrets. I wanted it to be made, and I think it's good, and you can't not do things because one person's not going to like it. That would be ruthlessness I suppose. \"But also, remember one of the things she was particularly miffed about was that she thought it was all not true, but I never said it was true anyway.\" She laughs at her cleverness. It's an ugly moment. \"Oranges isn't autobiography. It's a way of using yourself and the past to create a fiction around all of that. When Paul Auster and Milan Kundera put themselves in their work it's called metafiction, when I do it it's autobiography.\" Art and life, completely intertwined. In the circumstances, I doubt if Mrs Winterson cared about metafiction. Art and life, a literary term in the feelings gap. The Wintersons, or their metafictitious representations, resurface in The.PowerBook as Mr and Mrs Muck, the parents of the narrator. The passages detailing their relationship have none of the diverting bravado of Oranges. They are flayed raw. \"I stopped being angry a long time ago,\" she says. \"But it's all still there. When I was writing stuff in The.Powerbook, I was a bit surprised. It had to come out.\" Her buttery Lancashire vowels draw tight. \"It was about settling an old score as well. Oranges had become so mythologised, even to the absurd point where people would say how lucky I was to have such a childhood. I needed to write something one more time about the particular kind of pain that was there.\" In the new novel, she also writes achingly for the first time about her birth mother. \"I was working in Cornwall at the time, I had a high fever and I was on my own. All this stuff was coming up, and I thought, 'You can let go of this.' And it was letting everything go. It was from that time, in March 1999, that I really felt the bad period [since Art And Lies] was over. That was the end of it. The fever went, I got up, wrote all that stuff down much as you read it now. I thought, 'Good, I think I've got to the bottom of the heap here', and went home.\" She has never attempted to contact her birth mother. \"It would be a huge mistake. She made the choice she did. I've been in the public eye, and she knows what my name is. Some things are over before they start. Family life is a bit of a mystery to me. I don't understand it. I have no experience of such feelings, so I'm pretty sure I haven't got them. Clearly, family life isn't for me. Maybe it's what keeps me focused, and in the early days what kept me ruthless. Because you have to be ruthless to fight your way up. I didn't have to worry about anyone. I didn't feel I owed anybody anything. Once I left home, I thought, 'I'm on my own, I always have been in effect, and now I have to get on with it and make it happen.'\" There is human sadness here, no matter how she words it as indifference. There is ugliness and randomness that she will re-write as beauty and control, for herself, for her readers. What could family life have taught her? Without the lesson, she writes for belonging, for certainties, to make herself new and to keep herself all her own work. Yet, despite this uncharacteristic deferral to circumstance, her emotional life is hardly void. Her friends all employ the same descriptives: difficult, loyal, worth it. \"I give a lot, but I demand a lot,\" says Winterson. \"I suppose because I never had a family as such, my friends are my family. So all the things you would expect in a family circle, where people really go at it but know that they really love each other, is what happens to me with my friends. I've lost friends, there are some that I regret and that are totally my fault. There have been times in my life when I've just wanted everything different, and I've walked away. And that's hard.\" What violence must that singular quest for renewal do to softer hearts? In Winterson legend, sexually she was ever the Casanova, particularly where married women were concerned. She is not a pretty thing, nor is she superficially flirtatious, but one can imagine the force of her, the desire to be drawn into her, must be compulsive. There is a yarn about Winterson involving saucepans. In 1997, to much attendant media moistness, she divulged that, when she first arrived in London as a boyish twentysomething, she serviced frustrated married women from the Home Counties in hotel rooms off Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. Having minimal access to the hard stuff, they paid her in Le Creuset. The hilarity - of the story, of the telling of the story - tickles her still. \" That was funny. It got blown up out of all proportion, but it was such a good story!\" The kernel is true, she concedes, before adding, tantalisingly, \"and I do have an awful lot of pans. Even now, if we get a big one with risotto stuck to the bottom, I say to Peggy, 'You've no idea how hard I had to work for that, and look what you've done to it...' - and I get biffed. It got all dressed up as lesbian prostitution, which it really wasn't. It was simply to do with a very strange and particular time which couldn't happen now, with ladies leading double lives. I was very young. They just wanted to buy me presents, and I needed cookware.\" As in her art, so in her life, married women have appeared frequently. \"I've always had a strange attraction to and for them. I think it's a kind of pleasure and danger thing.\" Did it stem from a fear of involvement on her part? There is no lover so tempting to the commitment-phobe as the already-partnered partner. \"No, I hate it. I mind subterfuge. I made it clear to Peggy that I couldn't get involved with her while she was married [the pair have now been together for 11 years]. She had to leave for her own reasons, and I wasn't promising to be there. Which is a bit brutal, but I'd had enough of all that. Peggy left and found me again. I thought that was incredibly brave and completely honest. It's actually the only proper way to proceed.\" Her sense of the proper is endearing, her lust for control confronting. She sets up the sexual, and therefore gendered, choices in her life like ladder rungs. \"Kids don't leave home at 16 because they've fallen in love with another girl. That's a big either/or choice. But I wanted that more than I wanted any of the other things that were on offer. I don't put stability and comfort very high up the list anyway, they're not worth sacrificing anything for. So I suppose I became a conscious sexual being, thinking I'd made a choice for another person that I desired early on, and that continued, because it was a way of understanding myself and who I was, and of laying claim to the world. It was about power, but not about power over other people. I wanted power over myself, and I used sex to find that. It told me who I was in a very straightforward way. I went through boys, girls, at random and whenever I could, because I just thought the more the better.\" Lesbianism is another choice, she tells me. \"It's very fashionable at the moment to say that everything is genetic, but it's a choice that I made quite consciously. I don't have any problems going to bed with men, don't dislike it, don't dislike them. I could choose, and with women I was able to get on with my life and do my work, and I'm not sure that I would have been able to do that if I'd been heterosexual. I feel like I didn't make a problem for myself, I made a solution. I knew I never wanted any kids. It would take up all my time because I would have to do it properly. \"Femininity is a construct,\" she continues, \"and I don't trust it. I think it's still difficult for women to be themselves in the way that men can, without any regard for what's happening around them. There is still that self-consciousness in women, that they are women, which is hampering. It's very difficult to do good work if you're self-conscious. It's not arrogance, it's straightforward single-mindedness, which people accept in men.\" Tell a truth about Jeanette Winterson. She divides like Moses and the Red Sea. Phoning round for context before I met her, I had never encountered such definitives: a sociopath, a seducer, fiercely loyal, impossibly demanding, a bitch, a blessing. For so many certainties, she must be a mystery. I was warned: she'll flirt, she'll charm, she'll give you what you want. So who did I meet? A brilliant child, compelling and easily bored, who one is moved to protect. A woman for whom self is absolute, keen and knowingly dissembling, who has found her place of safety behind the words. No comfort, no coward. She must be a bugger to love. She's probably worth it. Older now, more even, she is delighted by her life: her horses and her haybales, country domesticity and her beautiful woman, though she teases that she may take a mistress in the future \"now that the 40s are the new 30s\". She'll never know when to stop. In The PowerBook, she writes: \"In this life you have to be your own hero. By that I mean you have to win whatever it is that matters to you by your own strength and in your own way.\" Tell a story about Jeanette Winterson.

The stories in the Bible, he points out tirelessly, are just that, stories: narratives designed to make us laugh, or weep, or tremble. And narratives designed to do one thing or another are usually, in every other context but the Biblical, assumed to be fictions.

The only prophet anyone ever listened to was Jonah, Thompson points out; and the only people who listened to him were Ninevites. That Jonah is considered fictive, but the Jonah of II Kings is not - \"for lack of a whale\". Or why, in a book which supposedly wants us to worship God, is there continual reference to this character called Yahweh who is by turns vindictive, callous, indifferent, bored, playful, terrifying or - as our own experience so directly and continuously tells us - for all practical purposes simply not there? </p> <p>I remember a fairly recent item in the excellent satirical on-line magazine, The Onion, whose headline was, \"slight inconsistency found in Bible\", in which a baffled mid-Western pastor notices that God is described as merciful in one book, yet wrathful in another, and can think of no explanation. Here is a book that might help that pastor </p> <p>AN Wilson, reviewing this book, said: \"This is a very important book. It should be given to every person training for the ministry or priesthood of a Christian church.\" I would go further: I would say that there is a strong case for saying that this book should be given to anyone with an interest in religion instead of the Bible.</p> <p>Thompson, who is a serious scholar (and one who was shunned for a decade for his theories, having to make a living as a plasterer and decorator - which at least taught him to recognise the story of Esarhaddon's palace, layered with gold \"like plaster\", as a flight of fancy) may find this an offensively frivolous suggestion; but given that there are so many dangerously cretinous interpretations of the Bible going around (\"very promising\" is how he describes research suggesting that some of the Bible was written by Taliban-like fundamentalists), it is hugely important that such a mind-boggling and indeed revelatory book as this should be read.</p>",

We abandon the simplest, most useful tools of our understanding when we assume that the Old Testament is some kind of history: the ability to recognise metaphor, technique, rhetoric. What, for instance, is all that about the prophets? The only prophet anyone ever listened to was Jonah, Thompson points out; and the only people who listened to him were Ninevites. That Jonah is considered fictive, but the Jonah of II Kings is not - \"for lack of a whale\". Or why, in a book which supposedly wants us to worship God, is there continual reference to this character called Yahweh who is by turns vindictive, callous, indifferent, bored, playful, terrifying or - as our own experience so directly and continuously tells us - for all practical purposes simply not there? I remember a fairly recent item in the excellent satirical on-line magazine, The Onion, whose headline was, \"slight inconsistency found in Bible\", in which a baffled mid-Western pastor notices that God is described as merciful in one book, yet wrathful in another, and can think of no explanation. Here is a book that might help that pastor AN Wilson, reviewing this book, said: \"This is a very important book. It should be given to every person training for the ministry or priesthood of a Christian church.\" I would go further: I would say that there is a strong case for saying that this book should be given to anyone with an interest in religion instead of the Bible. Thompson, who is a serious scholar (and one who was shunned for a decade for his theories, having to make a living as a plasterer and decorator - which at least taught him to recognise the story of Esarhaddon's palace, layered with gold \"like plaster\", as a flight of fancy) may find this an offensively frivolous suggestion; but given that there are so many dangerously cretinous interpretations of the Bible going around (\"very promising\" is how he describes research suggesting that some of the Bible was written by Taliban-like fundamentalists), it is hugely important that such a mind-boggling and indeed revelatory book as this should be read.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You can't help wondering, as you read bedtime stories to your children, about who created them. Who, for instance, is the tortured soul who invented Aldo, the imaginary rabbit who befriends a little girl whose head is being shoved down the loo at school but whose parents are too busy rowing to notice anything's wrong? </p> <p>Joyous fantasy and sorrow co-exist in John Burningham's books, never more so than in Granpa (now a film by the makers of The Snowman), which sets up a beautiful relationship between a little girl and her grandfather, only to confront the young reader with the unambiguous emptiness of Granpa's chair on the last page. </p> <p>You can't help picturing John Burningham as a tormented, lonely individual - until you meet him. His rambling Hampstead home is full of treasures - an ancient wind-up gramophone with an enormous horn, an ornamental bird-cage, part of a balcony rescued from the Savoy. It overlooks the Heath to one side and a magical, semi-formal garden to the other. All this he shares with the illustrator Helen Oxenbury, mother of his three children, to whom his first book, Borka, was dedicated in 1963 (it subsequently won the Kate Greenaway Medal). Their home gives you a whiff of longing for family life as it should be - hilarious, loving, eccentric. </p> <p>Just as the stories refuse to talk down to their readers, so do the pictures. There are two types of illustration in the books - muted, figurative, almost bland drawings that tend to depict real life, and the tumultuous, textured, colour-saturated landscapes representing the imaginative world. Here there are no conventional primary colours or sentimental animals. Harvey Slumfenburger's Christmas Present, for example, boasts almost a whole page of solid black snow. Each title contains several extraordinary works of art in its pages. </p> <p>\"I don't think there's that great a gulf between children and us,\" says Burningham. \"I don't say 'I'm going to do something for the kiddies.' The interesting thing is that they aren't tactful at all - if they don't like something, they won't bother with it. But equally these books are bought by adults and, if they get bored by them, it's absolutely hopeless.\"</p> <p>Burningham doesn't ascribe any particular credit for his work to his unconventional schooling. His parents tried him at 10 different schools (\"always batty, Steiner and co-ed numbers\") before settling on Summerhill school in Suffolk. Since lessons weren't compulsory, the young Burningham was able to spend hours in the art room. His healthy contempt for conventional schooling is wonderfully betrayed by John Patrick Norman McHennessy in The Boy Who Was Always Late, where a stick-wielding teacher is hoist on the petard of his own literal-mindedness. </p> <p>Burningham won't be drawn on whether the Summerhill atmosphere is to be thanked for his subsequent creativity. \"The best preparation for my work now was the fact that I wasn't pressured as a child. Mucking about is essential for everybody.\" </p> <p>The books certainly give a feeling that Burningham is on the side of his child readers. Adults often play a peripheral role, or are just plain boring (Shirley's parents in Come Away From The Water, Shirley just snooze in their deck chairs, while she embarks on fabulous adventures with pirates and buried treasure). \"I think that in order to be a successful writer for children you have to be able to communicate with a certain age group. I've stuck to a mental age of five,\" he confesses. </p> <p>But equally, he draws on his experiences as a parent, and some inspiring relationships between children and adults occur in his books.

      "bodyText": "You can't help wondering, as you read bedtime stories to your children, about who created them. Who, for instance, is the tortured soul who invented Aldo, the imaginary rabbit who befriends a little girl whose head is being shoved down the loo at school but whose parents are too busy rowing to notice anything's wrong? Joyous fantasy and sorrow co-exist in John Burningham's books, never more so than in Granpa (now a film by the makers of The Snowman), which sets up a beautiful relationship between a little girl and her grandfather, only to confront the young reader with the unambiguous emptiness of Granpa's chair on the last page. You can't help picturing John Burningham as a tormented, lonely individual - until you meet him. His rambling Hampstead home is full of treasures - an ancient wind-up gramophone with an enormous horn, an ornamental bird-cage, part of a balcony rescued from the Savoy. It overlooks the Heath to one side and a magical, semi-formal garden to the other. All this he shares with the illustrator Helen Oxenbury, mother of his three children, to whom his first book, Borka, was dedicated in 1963 (it subsequently won the Kate Greenaway Medal). Their home gives you a whiff of longing for family life as it should be - hilarious, loving, eccentric. Just as the stories refuse to talk down to their readers, so do the pictures. There are two types of illustration in the books - muted, figurative, almost bland drawings that tend to depict real life, and the tumultuous, textured, colour-saturated landscapes representing the imaginative world. Here there are no conventional primary colours or sentimental animals. Harvey Slumfenburger's Christmas Present, for example, boasts almost a whole page of solid black snow. Each title contains several extraordinary works of art in its pages. \"I don't think there's that great a gulf between children and us,\" says Burningham. \"I don't say 'I'm going to do something for the kiddies.' The interesting thing is that they aren't tactful at all - if they don't like something, they won't bother with it. But equally these books are bought by adults and, if they get bored by them, it's absolutely hopeless.\" Burningham doesn't ascribe any particular credit for his work to his unconventional schooling. His parents tried him at 10 different schools (\"always batty, Steiner and co-ed numbers\") before settling on Summerhill school in Suffolk. Since lessons weren't compulsory, the young Burningham was able to spend hours in the art room. His healthy contempt for conventional schooling is wonderfully betrayed by John Patrick Norman McHennessy in The Boy Who Was Always Late, where a stick-wielding teacher is hoist on the petard of his own literal-mindedness. Burningham won't be drawn on whether the Summerhill atmosphere is to be thanked for his subsequent creativity. \"The best preparation for my work now was the fact that I wasn't pressured as a child. Mucking about is essential for everybody.\" The books certainly give a feeling that Burningham is on the side of his child readers. Adults often play a peripheral role, or are just plain boring (Shirley's parents in Come Away From The Water, Shirley just snooze in their deck chairs, while she embarks on fabulous adventures with pirates and buried treasure). \"I think that in order to be a successful writer for children you have to be able to communicate with a certain age group. I've stuck to a mental age of five,\" he confesses. But equally, he draws on his experiences as a parent, and some inspiring relationships between children and adults occur in his books. Many mothers will identify with Avocado Baby's mother as she crawls around on the floor with a spoon trying to feed her recalcitrant offspring. A few years ago, Burningham heard that somebody had written a PhD on one of his titles, Where's Julius? He eagerly read it, but came to the uncomfortable conclusion that the scholar just hadn't understood the story. \"Very simply, it's a story about how parents have to put up with all the terrible, demanding, contrary phases that children go through, and that, if you do, they will one day turn into human beings,\" he says. Recently, Burningham's earlier work has become more overtly political. Whadayamean sees a group of children who have a direct line to God arguing against industrialists, clerics and militarists to save the planet. \"I went to some lengths to avoid mentioning the sex of God,\" muses Burningham. If this new direction lacks the subtlety of his best writing, there's comfort in the large-scale re-issue of many of his titles, as well as a new one, Hush-a-Bye, out next week, intended to be a foolproof way of getting any child to sleep. But in recent years Burningham has also produced maverick books for adults: England and France (both Cape). These contain witty illustrations interspersed with documentary evidence of those cultures.

She loved me too, and if there had been less love or less marriage I might have escaped. Perhaps no one really does escape.\" Jeanette Winterson's eighth novel, The.PowerBook, sets the triangular affairs of \"the great and ruinous lovers\" in the contexts of contemporary and classic fairytale, in London, Paris, Capri and cyberspace. Narrator Ali, or Alix, uses \"DNA\" to create an endless series of passionate, doomed love stories. </p> <p>Designed to suggest the appearance and the technique of virtual reality, with a cover like a computer handbook and chapter divisions of hard drives, icons and documents, The.PowerBook is not a playful postmodern experiment or an investigation of the multiple personalities of email. Instead, Winterson uses the metaphor of email to discuss sexual freedom and power. Sex, like the web, is an \"orderly anarchic space that no one can dictate, although everyone tries\". It is a story that always has a new beginning and never really ends. </p> <p>Alas - for, despite Winterson's great gifts as a writer, The.PowerBook retells the same story of adulterous bisexual love that she has been writing throughout the decade. Her obsession with the romantic triangle takes place on a higher aesthetic and intellectual level than the obsessions of this year's popular fiction, but like any of the candy-coloured novels about relationships stacked on the tables of London bookshops, it is still literary junk food. Despite a capacity for exquisite erotic prose, high intelligence and an inspiring commitment to serious art, Winterson is becoming a mannered novelist with nothing to say. </p> <p>Her plight is symptomatic of the situation of the English novel at the turn of the century: all dressed up and nowhere to go. At a historical moment of dazzling metamorphosis, when the country is transforming itself daily before our eyes - when the Thames skyline is a surreal mix of the classical, the Florentine and the avant-garde, when the English dream seems to be just over the horizon or the rainbow, as the American dream was in 1900 when L Frank Baum wrote The Wizard of Oz - English novelists are turning away from the big subjects to the perennial small change of romance.</p> <p>Writing about singles and couples, triangles and hexagons, about love instead of money, about sex instead of power, about the past instead of the future, they are measuring out in latte spoons the greatest social material offered to fiction since the 1840s.

In Salon in 1997, she told interviewer Laura Miller that she was attracted to the theme of the woman having an affair with a married woman because she liked \"to look at how people work together when they are put into stressful situations, when life stops being cosy, when there is a chance element which unsettles all the rules, which forces people back onto their own resources, and away from their habits\".</p> <p>For Winterson, the romantic triangle may be a microcosm of deracination and social upheaval. Marriage, in her fiction, is a metaphor for stifling social stability and unthinking conformity. In The.PowerBook, marriage is a space with \"too many clocks and not enough time. Too much furniture and too little space\". In Written on the Body (1992), the narrator \"used to think of marriage as a plate-glass window just begging for a brick. The self-exhibition, the self-satisfaction, smarminess, tightness, tight-arsedness\". </p> <p>Moreover, Winterson sees herself, not without justification, in the high-modernist, anti-realist tradition of Woolf and Stein. \"I am not interested in realism for its own sake,\" she insists in the introduction to her screenplay Great Moments in Aviation. \"The point of fiction is not to mirror real life but to set out from it, to alter our viewing angle and perhaps even the world we are viewing.\" Similarly, she rejects plot: \"I do not like it. I think it is best left to crime writers of the old school.\" If the novel is to survive, she argues in Art Objects (1996), \"it will have to do more than to tell a story.

She loved me too, and if there had been less love or less marriage I might have escaped. Perhaps no one really does escape.\" Jeanette Winterson's eighth novel, The.PowerBook, sets the triangular affairs of \"the great and ruinous lovers\" in the contexts of contemporary and classic fairytale, in London, Paris, Capri and cyberspace. Narrator Ali, or Alix, uses \"DNA\" to create an endless series of passionate, doomed love stories. Designed to suggest the appearance and the technique of virtual reality, with a cover like a computer handbook and chapter divisions of hard drives, icons and documents, The.PowerBook is not a playful postmodern experiment or an investigation of the multiple personalities of email. Instead, Winterson uses the metaphor of email to discuss sexual freedom and power. Sex, like the web, is an \"orderly anarchic space that no one can dictate, although everyone tries\". It is a story that always has a new beginning and never really ends. Alas - for, despite Winterson's great gifts as a writer, The.PowerBook retells the same story of adulterous bisexual love that she has been writing throughout the decade. Her obsession with the romantic triangle takes place on a higher aesthetic and intellectual level than the obsessions of this year's popular fiction, but like any of the candy-coloured novels about relationships stacked on the tables of London bookshops, it is still literary junk food. Despite a capacity for exquisite erotic prose, high intelligence and an inspiring commitment to serious art, Winterson is becoming a mannered novelist with nothing to say. Her plight is symptomatic of the situation of the English novel at the turn of the century: all dressed up and nowhere to go. At a historical moment of dazzling metamorphosis, when the country is transforming itself daily before our eyes - when the Thames skyline is a surreal mix of the classical, the Florentine and the avant-garde, when the English dream seems to be just over the horizon or the rainbow, as the American dream was in 1900 when L Frank Baum wrote The Wizard of Oz - English novelists are turning away from the big subjects to the perennial small change of romance. Writing about singles and couples, triangles and hexagons, about love instead of money, about sex instead of power, about the past instead of the future, they are measuring out in latte spoons the greatest social material offered to fiction since the 1840s. Stylish and fashionably satirical, they seem afraid to tackle big subjects and to take either the subjects or themselves seriously.

For Winterson, the romantic triangle may be a microcosm of deracination and social upheaval. Marriage, in her fiction, is a metaphor for stifling social stability and unthinking conformity.

They do that rather well: the neighbours have a saying, \"Don't fuck with the Culture\". </p> <p>The latest novel, Look to Windward, focuses on a typical Culture world called Masaq'. Not a globe but an immense landscaped ring, this world offers its 50bn inhabitants every climate, terrain and distraction they could wish for. Here you can travel a river longer than a thousand Amazons or risk your life rafting on molten lava. It could be paradise, but for a reminder that things don't always go according to plan. Eight centuries after the Culture fought off its greatest challenge, a war that raged for 50 years and destroyed entire solar systems, the glow from one of the exploding stars has just reached Masaq'. \"Tonight,\" as one visitor puts it, \"you dance by the light of ancient mistakes.\" </p> <p>And now another chicken is coming home to roost. Billions have died because of the Culture's meddling in the neighbouring civilisation of Chel, where it set off a civil war, and some of the Chelgrians have decided to take revenge. Their instrument is a soldier called Quilan, who is sent to Masaq' on a mission that is a mystery even to him. He is one of the misguided yet decent villains who are a feature of these tales: complicit in a planned \"gigadeathcrime\", he is still honourable and courageous. As the moment of reckoning approaches, his memories take us back to the days before the war, when his existence still had meaning and his wife was alive. </p> <p>Banks has tremendous fun with his giant canvas. Masaq' is not enough to satisfy him: he throws in Chel, a world of woods, cliffs and grassy plains, and a giant gas bubble where sentient dirigibles go courting by the light of seven stars. He crams in his beloved battle scenes, wickedly named spaceships (I Blame The Parents; Lapsed Pacifist; Now Look What You Made Me Do...) and picturesque aliens. One looks like a black pyramid and is always being ignored at parties because humans think he is a piece of sculpture. </p> <p>The one false note comes in the description of the Chelgrians, which manages to be both over-ambitious and half-arsed. These five-legged creatures are supposed to have evolved far from human contact, yet they smile when they are happy, cry when they are sad, love, hate, smoke pipes, compose music, go window shopping, even get married. Let's face it: they're humans in fancy dress. This may help us empathise with them, but it's distracting. </p> <p>This is a rare lapse of attention. Banks usually leaves his brain switched on, and he is not afraid to to ponder the implications of his flash-bang spectaculars. He examines the fine distinction between hedonism (what the Culture thinks it practises) and decadence (what many others perceive), as well as the responsibilities that come with immeasurable power. An enjoyable romp is overlaid with tragedy as he rubs our noses in the consequences of war: when Quilan's wife is lost in battle, the dull weight of his suffering bears down on us like a lowering sky. It is both comforting and fitting when he strikes up a friendship with someone who is supposed to be his enemy, a Culture war veteran still troubled by the deaths he caused long ago. \"Sorrow seems a common commodity,\" Quilan remarks. </p> <p>And all the time Banks keeps ratcheting up the suspense. Will the Chelgrians' plot succeed? What is the atrocity they are planning? And is Quilan's missus really, truly dead? Ever since his first novel, The Wasp Factory, in which the narrator didn't even know his/her own sex, Banks has demonstrated an exceptional flair for misdirection: the more you know him, the more you distrust every apparent fact.

The \u00d6resund bridge, opened this summer, links Copenhagen and Malm\u00f6; the significance of the sea dividing Sweden and Norway from Denmark and mainland Europe has thus been diminished. \"Sweden is a beached unrigged ship\", wrote the country's greatest living poet, Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer, pointing up an island quality - an independence from the problems and decrees of elsewhere. </p> <p>But in fact the \u00d6resund bridge (bitterly resented by many, particularly ecologists) is the culmination of a long debate that became, in these famously consensual societies, all the fiercer as the 90s progressed: just how European are - or should be - the Scandinavian countries? During the last decade Sweden voted to join the EU, as did Finland; Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty in one referendum and accepted it in a second, while Norway decided to stay out. This last result was determined not by the south-facing capital, Oslo, but by the north's stubborn traditionalist communities. </p> <p>Throughout Scandinavia there has been an increasing feeling that it is the northern regions, with their vast tracts of wilderness, that give the culture its distinctive definition. The Swedish novel of the 90s was Kerstin Ekman's wonderful Blackwater (Vintage, \u00a36.99), a huge critical and popular success.</p> <p>A young woman prepared to view everything through the rosy spectacles of the 1970s Green Wave comes to a remote northern community. Within an hour of her arrival she has stumbled across the victims of a brutal murder: two hitchhikers, both foreigners, hacked to death in their lakeside tent. It takes almost two decades for the crime to be solved, and the whole situation is metaphoric of a way of life that spurns - and has been spurned by - the modern world. Perhaps the north is more and more a home for men (rather than women), an isolating world of elk blood and gun oil. Yet Ekman has made her home there, and her evocation of the landscape recalls such literary forebears as Nor way's great visionary novelist, Tarjei Vesaas, or Finland's children's writer of genius, Tove Jansson. </p> <p>Danish Peter H\u00f8eg's bestselling Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (Harvill, \u00a37.99) also pays tribute to the north. Here power resides not in Copenhagen, which is presented as promoting bureaucratic secrecy and institutionalised racism, but in Denmark's former Arctic colony, Greenland: the heroine, farouche and percipient, is half Inuit. H\u00f8eg has gone on to champion the atavistic (and honest) over the societised (and dishonest) in later work, notably The Woman and the Ape (Harvill, \u00a36.99). </p> <p>But the majority of Scandinavians, of course, live in cities and are members of sophisticated, high-tech communities. For the greater part of the past century they have enjoyed international pre-eminence for their social democracy; in Sweden especially, the Social Democrat parties have known remarkable political hegemony. Closer integration with Europe could mean surrender of integrity, so opposition to \"Brussels\" frequently comes from the left. </p> <p>One prominent literary spokesperson for this faction is the fine Swedish novelist and dramatist P-O Enquist, while in Norway a writer of major stature imaginatively bound up with the old left is Per Petterson. For me his To Siberia (Harvill, \u00a312.99) is one of the past decade's most moving novels. It charts the life of his Danish mother who, with her beloved brother, devoted her youth to the international socialist cause. </p> <p>Ecological threat aside, the new \u00d6resund bridge is so potent a symbol because it reminds us that the outside world sooner or later asserts itself. With the end of the cold war, Swedish neutrality - a principled apartness - was no longer easy to justify; its critics saw it as shot through with evasions and deceptions.</p> <p>The shadow of the second world war grew longer as the 20th century neared its end. A distinguished Swedish journalist observed that his country had never produced a writer who'd tackled head-on the subject of Swedish war guilt, as Max Frisch did in comparable Switzerland. Norway remembered that one of its greatest writers, Knut Hamsun, was an ardent, unrepentant Nazi, and P-O Enquist wrote a fine film script about him. Suddenly a hornet's nest had been disturbed; it is buzzing still. A magnificent Norwegian novel, Gunnar Kopperud's The Time of Light (Bloomsbury, \u00a315.99), enters the mind of a young German fighting at Stalingrad and helps us all to come to terms with guilt and complicity. </p> <p>Unfortunately, not all Scandinavia's talents have been promoted or even translated for English speakers. Norway's Kjell Askildsen's fascinating short stories deserve greater currency, while his compatriot Dag Solstad's explorations of shifting Norwegian society await a translator - as does the work of Sweden's socially incisive and psychologically bold Bodil Malmsten, and of Jonas Gardell, who has broken his country's fixation with the norm with his gay sensibility expressed in novels, plays and outrageous one-man shows. Agneta Pleijel, whose George Eliot-like moral seriousness combines with acute lyrical insight, has been translated only patchily.</p> <p>Admirable Edinburgh publisher Canongate next month publishes the Danish Jens Christian Grondahl's anatomy of marriage and personality, Silence in October, but no one has offered the Swede Bj\u00f6rn Ranelid's work to the English world. And who will render into English the Norwegian poet Steinar Opstad's sensitive insights into the familial and personal? Clearly it will take more than the \u00d6resund bridge to open up communications.</p> <p>\u0095 Paul Binding edited The Babel Guide to Scandinavian Fiction (Boulevard, \u00a39.95).</p>",

Yet Ekman has made her home there, and her evocation of the landscape recalls such literary forebears as Nor way's great visionary novelist, Tarjei Vesaas, or Finland's children's writer of genius, Tove Jansson. Danish Peter H\u00f8eg's bestselling Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (Harvill, \u00a37.99) also pays tribute to the north. Here power resides not in Copenhagen, which is presented as promoting bureaucratic secrecy and institutionalised racism, but in Denmark's former Arctic colony, Greenland: the heroine, farouche and percipient, is half Inuit. H\u00f8eg has gone on to champion the atavistic (and honest) over the societised (and dishonest) in later work, notably The Woman and the Ape (Harvill, \u00a36.99). But the majority of Scandinavians, of course, live in cities and are members of sophisticated, high-tech communities. For the greater part of the past century they have enjoyed international pre-eminence for their social democracy; in Sweden especially, the Social Democrat parties have known remarkable political hegemony. Closer integration with Europe could mean surrender of integrity, so opposition to \"Brussels\" frequently comes from the left. One prominent literary spokesperson for this faction is the fine Swedish novelist and dramatist P-O Enquist, while in Norway a writer of major stature imaginatively bound up with the old left is Per Petterson. For me his To Siberia (Harvill, \u00a312.99) is one of the past decade's most moving novels. It charts the life of his Danish mother who, with her beloved brother, devoted her youth to the international socialist cause. Ecological threat aside, the new \u00d6resund bridge is so potent a symbol because it reminds us that the outside world sooner or later asserts itself. With the end of the cold war, Swedish neutrality - a principled apartness - was no longer easy to justify; its critics saw it as shot through with evasions and deceptions. The shadow of the second world war grew longer as the 20th century neared its end. A distinguished Swedish journalist observed that his country had never produced a writer who'd tackled head-on the subject of Swedish war guilt, as Max Frisch did in comparable Switzerland. Norway remembered that one of its greatest writers, Knut Hamsun, was an ardent, unrepentant Nazi, and P-O Enquist wrote a fine film script about him. Suddenly a hornet's nest had been disturbed; it is buzzing still. A magnificent Norwegian novel, Gunnar Kopperud's The Time of Light (Bloomsbury, \u00a315.99), enters the mind of a young German fighting at Stalingrad and helps us all to come to terms with guilt and complicity. Unfortunately, not all Scandinavia's talents have been promoted or even translated for English speakers. Norway's Kjell Askildsen's fascinating short stories deserve greater currency, while his compatriot Dag Solstad's explorations of shifting Norwegian society await a translator - as does the work of Sweden's socially incisive and psychologically bold Bodil Malmsten, and of Jonas Gardell, who has broken his country's fixation with the norm with his gay sensibility expressed in novels, plays and outrageous one-man shows. Agneta Pleijel, whose George Eliot-like moral seriousness combines with acute lyrical insight, has been translated only patchily. Admirable Edinburgh publisher Canongate next month publishes the Danish Jens Christian Grondahl's anatomy of marriage and personality, Silence in October, but no one has offered the Swede Bj\u00f6rn Ranelid's work to the English world. And who will render into English the Norwegian poet Steinar Opstad's sensitive insights into the familial and personal? Clearly it will take more than the \u00d6resund bridge to open up communications. \u0095 Paul Binding edited The Babel Guide to Scandinavian Fiction (Boulevard, \u00a39.95).",

This is the cardinal error made by Professor Tom Shippey in his long and densely packed study, JRR Tolkien: Author of the Century, which - as its title may suggest - is a belligerently argued piece of fan-magazine polemic.</p> <p>Shippey wants to feel that his own enthusiasm, which is for morally serious fantasy of the kind Tolkien pioneered, is worthy of a place up there at the top table alongside the totemic great names of the western canon. Accordingly, he classifies Tolkien as equal with (or ahead of) James Joyce, George Orwell, William Golding and Kurt Vonnegut, and then castigates the \"literary snobs\" who disagree. </p> <p>The trouble is, it's not just literary snobs who don't accept Tolkien as one of the greatest writers of the last century. Almost no one does, except the hard-core Tolkien addicts who've elevated his books to the status of a cult. Shippey makes a legitimate case for the enduring commercial popularity of The Lord of the Rings, but if we're talking of \"lasting value\" I doubt whether popularity has any significance.</p> <p>People read the tales of Middle Earth the way they've always read cunningly wrought fantasies - the way they read Sherlock Holmes or James Bond or Dracula - drinking in the excitement of the atmosphere, revelling in the hypnotic detail. They don't read them the way the 19th-century public read Nicholas Nickleby or War and Peace, feeling that these books were somehow inseparable from the life and thought of their age. </p> <p>It's this absence of common literary horse sense that makes me feel that a critic who tries to raise the creation of Hobbits and Middle Earth above what was achieved by Yeats, Eliot, Conrad, Joyce, D H Lawrence or Auden is either artistically tone deaf or harmlessly dotty. After the annihilating traumas of the last century, it's merely perverse to ascribe greatness to this airy but strangely simplified mock-Teutonic never-never land, where races and species intermingle at will and great battles are fought but there is never any remotely convincing treatment of those fundamental human concerns through which all societies ultimately define themselves - religion, philosophy, politics and the conduct of sexual relationships. </p> <p>So much of what Shippey says in Tolkien's favour cuts the opposite way. He discourses on the profundity of Tolkien's treatment of evil without appearing to see that Sauron, the Ring Lord, is no more than a compelling melodrama villain. Personified evil, though effective in its intended fantasy-adventure context, can't and doesn't implicate its readers emotionally, as do William Golding's Lord of the Flies or The Inheritors, which use exotic and far-removed settings to throw back at us a prophetically twisted image of our own corruptibility. Nor is it something insidious and institutional, working through structures and organisations in a recognisably sophisticated way, as in Orwell's 1984 or Huxley's Brave New World. </p> <p>To praise Tolkien for his archaic authenticity with languages is to miss the point. It's not his Old Norse or High German that's the problem, it's his English - the twee doggerel of Tom Bombadil, the high-falutin' Hollywood-epic inversions of the speeches at Rivendell, and that meandering prose style that is half Old Testament pastiche, half 1920s ripping yarn. The mix of high severity and low bluntness we find in a writer such as Sir Thomas Malory is entirely beyond Tolkien's reach; so too is the great poet's awareness of the inadequacy of language itself, that shrinks the thousand-year gap between us and those Anglo-Saxon masterpieces The Wanderer and The Seafarer. </p> <p>Tolkien lacked the qualities that might have made The Lord Of The Rings a masterpiece: the language of a poet and the perception of a philosopher. When, at the end of the Morte d'Arthur, Sir Ector enters Joyous Guard to find his comrade Sir Lancelot lying dead, we hear, in the spontaneity and simple stoicism of his grief, some of the finest dramatic speech written in English before Shakespeare. When, in the last pages of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo leaves the Shire and departs for the Grey Havens, all we hear in the suavely allegorical and too sweetly cadenced prose are plagiaristic echoes of other books, other voices - Malory, Tennyson, Andrew Lang, William Morris, the King James Bible.</p> <p>Yet the moment itself, and its high-aspiring style - \"And it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise\" - lie at the heart of what Tolkien and Lewis were striving to achieve.</p> <p>Their vision, for all its limits, was not ignoble. Some faith that had been lost amid the slaughter of 1914-18 is respected in their fiction. Both were devoutly religious, and for both life was largely an intensification of what they'd read and talked about and imagined. Both locate their image of God in the same emotional places: in the sensuous, pre-industrial beauty of an invented natural world and the childlike stillness of the accepting human mind. The tone is lyrical, the meaning apocalyptic. Tolkien's Middle Earth and Lewis's Narnia were what these men thought and hoped that heaven might be like.</p>",

Accordingly, he classifies Tolkien as equal with (or ahead of) James Joyce, George Orwell, William Golding and Kurt Vonnegut, and then castigates the \"literary snobs\" who disagree. The trouble is, it's not just literary snobs who don't accept Tolkien as one of the greatest writers of the last century. Almost no one does, except the hard-core Tolkien addicts who've elevated his books to the status of a cult. Shippey makes a legitimate case for the enduring commercial popularity of The Lord of the Rings, but if we're talking of \"lasting value\" I doubt whether popularity has any significance. People read the tales of Middle Earth the way they've always read cunningly wrought fantasies - the way they read Sherlock Holmes or James Bond or Dracula - drinking in the excitement of the atmosphere, revelling in the hypnotic detail. They don't read them the way the 19th-century public read Nicholas Nickleby or War and Peace, feeling that these books were somehow inseparable from the life and thought of their age. It's this absence of common literary horse sense that makes me feel that a critic who tries to raise the creation of Hobbits and Middle Earth above what was achieved by Yeats, Eliot, Conrad, Joyce, D H Lawrence or Auden is either artistically tone deaf or harmlessly dotty. After the annihilating traumas of the last century, it's merely perverse to ascribe greatness to this airy but strangely simplified mock-Teutonic never-never land, where races and species intermingle at will and great battles are fought but there is never any remotely convincing treatment of those fundamental human concerns through which all societies ultimately define themselves - religion, philosophy, politics and the conduct of sexual relationships. So much of what Shippey says in Tolkien's favour cuts the opposite way. He discourses on the profundity of Tolkien's treatment of evil without appearing to see that Sauron, the Ring Lord, is no more than a compelling melodrama villain. Personified evil, though effective in its intended fantasy-adventure context, can't and doesn't implicate its readers emotionally, as do William Golding's Lord of the Flies or The Inheritors, which use exotic and far-removed settings to throw back at us a prophetically twisted image of our own corruptibility. Nor is it something insidious and institutional, working through structures and organisations in a recognisably sophisticated way, as in Orwell's 1984 or Huxley's Brave New World. To praise Tolkien for his archaic authenticity with languages is to miss the point. It's not his Old Norse or High German that's the problem, it's his English - the twee doggerel of Tom Bombadil, the high-falutin' Hollywood-epic inversions of the speeches at Rivendell, and that meandering prose style that is half Old Testament pastiche, half 1920s ripping yarn. The mix of high severity and low bluntness we find in a writer such as Sir Thomas Malory is entirely beyond Tolkien's reach; so too is the great poet's awareness of the inadequacy of language itself, that shrinks the thousand-year gap between us and those Anglo-Saxon masterpieces The Wanderer and The Seafarer. Tolkien lacked the qualities that might have made The Lord Of The Rings a masterpiece: the language of a poet and the perception of a philosopher. When, at the end of the Morte d'Arthur, Sir Ector enters Joyous Guard to find his comrade Sir Lancelot lying dead, we hear, in the spontaneity and simple stoicism of his grief, some of the finest dramatic speech written in English before Shakespeare. When, in the last pages of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo leaves the Shire and departs for the Grey Havens, all we hear in the suavely allegorical and too sweetly cadenced prose are plagiaristic echoes of other books, other voices - Malory, Tennyson, Andrew Lang, William Morris, the King James Bible. Yet the moment itself, and its high-aspiring style - \"And it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise\" - lie at the heart of what Tolkien and Lewis were striving to achieve. Their vision, for all its limits, was not ignoble. Some faith that had been lost amid the slaughter of 1914-18 is respected in their fiction. Both were devoutly religious, and for both life was largely an intensification of what they'd read and talked about and imagined. Both locate their image of God in the same emotional places: in the sensuous, pre-industrial beauty of an invented natural world and the childlike stillness of the accepting human mind. The tone is lyrical, the meaning apocalyptic. Tolkien's Middle Earth and Lewis's Narnia were what these men thought and hoped that heaven might be like.",

      "body": "<p>When Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992 the citation said he was honoured \"for a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment.\" </p> <p> This vision and commitment were forged in the extraordinary cultural melting pot that is the Caribbean. There is English, Dutch, Creole and African all represented within two generations of his lineage. He was brought up in a British colony as an English-speaking Methodist, but St Lucia was mostly a Creole-speaking Catholic island. In social terms he was from an intellectual elite, while economically he was harshly poor. Black and white have of course played a big part in Walcott's life, but it is the colours in between that have defined the man and his work. Or as he put it in his 1979 autobiographical poem The Schooner Flight: </p> <p> I'm just a red nigger who love the sea, <br> I had a sound colonial education, I have Dutch, nigger and English in me, <br> and either I'm nobody, or I'm a nation. </p> <p>The writer Marina Warner first saw Walcott at a reading in a former 18th-century prison in Dublin. \"He read a section of his poem Omeros where a woman opens a box and the whole of the empire spills out in these rolling stanzas packed with colonial symbolism,\" she recalls. \"Derek was surrounded by portraits of Lord Lieutenants of Ireland in their uniforms and medals. To see him reading these lines there, in his wonderful, rumbling Paul Robeson style of delivery, was a marvellous moment. It really was history talking back.\" </p> <p>Warner points out that he is simultaneously a profound critic of how the Caribbean has been treated by empire but is also very aware of the cultural legacy and riches that connection brings. \"He operates within this interesting contradiction all the time. He has a white grandfather and has green eyes. He is the patchwork quilt of the Caribbean.\" </p> <p>The novelist Caryl Phillips claims that Walcott \"has shown that there is a sense of what I would call 'big history' in the region, rather than seeing it as a set of scattered islands off the United States where small history happens. This is a place where much larger forces are at work.\" </p> <p>Poet David Dabydeen, who like Phillips was born in the region, notes that Walcott's approval for things like his \"sound colonial education\" can make him unpopular with \"people who believe in an easy flag-waving and drum-beating nationalism\". But while his work combines forms from English, Russian and Greek poetry, it also contains Caribbean rhythms and sensibility, explains Dabydeen. \"He shows that the seemingly diverse traditions of Creole and Mediterranean are not so diverse after all. The fact is that Europe is there in the form of the English, the Spanish, the French and the Dutch.\" </p> <p>Walcott's latest work, the 160-page poem Tiepolo's Hound, is another boldly ambitious explication of the synthesis between the Caribbean and the western world. It tells the story of the impressionist painter Camille Pissaro, a Sephardic Jew who was brought up on the Caribbean island of St Thomas, went to France in his mid-20s and helped to change the face of European art. The poem also tells the story of Walcott, another outsider and artist working against the prevailing fashions who left his Caribbean home to pursue his visions. </p> <p>As a young man Walcott considered being a professional painter, and the poem is illustrated with his work. \"But the text does says how hard I find painting and how much of it is failure,\" he quickly explains. \"It's not saying here's Pissaro and here's me. But it does show the relationship between the writing and the painting.\" </p> <p>Walcott covers some interesting art historical ground and makes a good case that Pissaro's wintry depictions of Paris are infused with Caribbean colouring. But it is the key question of why Pissaro chose to leave the region that most preoccupies him. It is quintessential Walcott material. </p> <p>\"There was no reason why he should have stayed in St Thomas,\" he says. \"If it is possible to feel bored and restless with contemporary St Thomas, imagine how it felt 150 years ago. Of course there's the business of him being white and Jewish, and it may be an anachronistic question or the wrong question about the wrong time. But I am still interested in the idea of why he went. I wonder whether painting that landscape and the black faces was ever a real choice for him. Was it considered a proper subject or was that at the time completely out of the question.\" </p> <p>Bruce King has written a major biography of Walcott that will be published by Oxford University Press in October. In Tiepolo's Hound, he sees Walcott again putting the West Indies at the centre of history rather than tangential to it. \"This is the real difference between him and Naipaul. Naipaul sees Trinidad as a backwater and Derek says, 'No, we are part of world culture. A lot of things have happened here.' Just because they don't have an economic base it will always be difficult to talk about West Indian independence, and perhaps it will always be a colony in an economic sense. But culturally it is amazing what has been produced there. And this is what he sees himself contributing to. To dismiss it all like Naipaul does is absurd.\" </p> <p>According to Caryl Phillips, Walcott has, almost single-handedly, created a poetic tradition in the Caribbean. That has been both a help and a hindrance to him. \"If you are working in the shadow of Yeats or Wordsworth you always have someone to measure yourself against. You are not on what Heaney calls 'a peasant's pilgrimage'. But Derek didn't have that comforting notion that there had been people before him. It makes what he has done even more remarkable.\" </p> <p>Dabydeen says Walcott's impact on the status of Caribbean writing has been profound. \"When he won the Nobel Prize in 1992 we all won the Nobel Prize. The symbolism of this on the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the region was immense. There is enormous local pride. There is a fish cake named after him in St Lucia, Columbus Square is now Walcott Square, and he carries all this with a great deal of the humility.\" </p> <p>In a sense Walcott was born into the cultural officer class of the region. His people were the teachers, preachers and local administrators. His father, Warwick Walcott, was a civil servant working for the attorney general. He was an opera fan, had a sizeable library, wrote poetry and painted. He was a significant figure in the local artistic scene and had set up a literary society and staged plays.</p> <p> His mother, Alix, was a headmistress. Derek and his twin brother Roderick, a theatre director who died earlier this year, were born in the largest town in St Lucia, Castries, in 1930. They had one older sister. Their father died when the boys were aged one, leaving his wife to bring up the children during a depression. Alix Walcott was an extremely forceful woman and very well read. Walcott remembers her singing Methodist hymns around the house and reciting great chunks of poetry and prose. \"Things like Cardinal Wolsey's farewell speech. She knew a lot of Portia's speeches and had played her in a production put on by my father. She was a real ham and a performer, and I always hoped that one day she would recite something of mine like that.\" </p> <p>In order to provide for the family she took in sewing work, but Walcott says he wasn't conscious of any deprivation. \"My mother hid the struggle from us children. She complained about her salary and she had a tough time. Although she became a headmistress she still had to do a lot of sewing. The more I think about her the more remarkable I realise she was. And she understood straight away when I said that I wanted to write.\" Walcott was also encouraged at his school, St Mary's College, by some of the younger teachers and the headmaster. \"They made me feel that this is what I should do. The headmaster asked to read one of my poems at some celebration or other when I was about 10. When I look back that is phenomenal encouragement.\" By the age of 14 his precocity had sparked an island row when a priest accused him of heresy after one of his poems, which said that God could be better found through nature than through preaching, was published in the local newspaper. </p> <p>Walcott's education was, apart from its location, identical to that of middle-class children in England at the time, and the travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, who visited the school in the early 50s, noted that \"it had a completely English atmosphere\". Astonishingly this tiny island school has produced two Nobel Prize winners, Walcott and the 1979 economics laureate Sir Arthur Lewis. Coincidentally they were both born on January 23. </p> <p>Walcott just missed out on the island scholarship to Oxford because he was bad at mathematics and so went to the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, where he studied French, Latin and Spanish. \"I don't know what would have happened to me as a writer if I had gone to England and shaped my life out of England. Of course I will never know, but I think I prefer what did happen.\" He says had a terrific time at university but didn't do any work, preferring to spend his time in the drama group and writing for the newspaper. \"There was the excitement of a new Caribbean being created,\" he says. \"There were new writers and artists emerging. Obviously colonialism was there and racism and history and so on. We had our anger, but it was kind of great to be angry - it had its own vigour. It wasn't at all sour or vengeful.\" </p> <p>After university he taught in schools in St Lucia, Grenada and Jamaica, as well as contributing articles and reviews to papers in Trinidad and Jamaica. In 1953 he went to live in Trinidad, where he continued to write poetry and plays. He and his brother had always written small plays which they performed themselves in the house. His first publicly performed plays were put on in St. Lucia in 1950. Later that year he won a Rockefeller scholarship to study theatre in New York. Walcott ended that trip early after suffering from homesickness but has subsequently worked a great deal in American theatre. In 1998 he was the co-lyricist in Capeman, Paul Simon's $11m Broadway debacle. It was based on the life of Puerto Rican Salvador Agr\u00f3n, who as a 16-year-old in the 1950s had murdered two white teenagers while wearing a red satin cape. The case had become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for radicals in the 60s and the musical attracted massive publicity. When it closed after just two months it was the most expensive failure in Broadway history. Even before its spectacular collapse Walcott had begun to dissociate himself from the show, complaining that his work was being butchered by the succession of directors brought in to salvage it. Ultimately he regarded the project as a waste of four years' work. </p> <p>When Walcott returned to Trinidad in 1959 he formed the Trinidad Theatre Workshop. It celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. \"We've had some terrific actors,\" he says. \"People sometimes dismiss it because it is not a professional theatre, but that's just because the economic context means it can't sustain professional theatre, it doesn't mean the performances are not first class.\" </p> <p>When Walcott's play, Ti-Jean, was performed in Central Park in New York in the early 1970s, two of the actors, Hamilton Parris and Albert Laveau, attracted rave reviews - better than those for the play itself. The theatre's reputation for excellence has since attracted overseas directors like the RSC's Terry Hands and Greg Doran, and the company has won awards when touring in America. But Walcott has still had to fight a long, bitter and largely unsuccessful battle with the Trinidad authorities to obtain state funding for what is a national theatre in all but name. </p> <p>\"The quality of literature that has come out of the Caribbean over the last 40 years has been phenomenal,\" he says. \"Who could have foreseen that a place like Trinidad, which is of the scale of some English counties, could have produced both Naipaul and CLR James? And there is equivalent potential there in the theatre. You would think that a society would say that art is as necessary as roads and sewage. But the attitude is that art is an amateur activity, which is not just short-sighted thinking, it is illiterate and ignorant thinking.\" </p> <p>Caryl Phillips sees why he is so angry. \"It's not as if vast amounts of money are needed, but even this wasn't forthcoming. It has grated on him as an individual. He made very early on a serious commitment to the Caribbean in terms not just of his aesthetic but also the physical and emotional trajectory of his life.\" </p> <p>This emotional trajectory has not been straightforward, and his professional and domestic life have often been stormy. Until he won the Nobel Prize he had been consistently short of money. His health was put under pressure by heavy drinking and smoking. He is now diabetic and no longer does either. His first marriage was in 1954 to Fay Moston, a secretary from a wealthy Jamaican family. They had one son, now a painter living in St Lucia, the following year, but the marriage broke up in 1956. His second wife, Margaret Maillard, was an almoner in a hos pital in Port of Spain, Trinidad. She was also active in the Trinidad arts scene as a dancer and a painter, and the couple shocked local opinion by living together before getting married. They have two daughters; one is now at university and the other works for an advertising company. Walcott has three grandchildren. </p> <p>His marriage to Margaret, shaky since the late 60s, broke up after he had an affair in the mid-70s with a young dancer in one of his plays, Norline Metivier. He married her in 1976, but that also ended in divorce. His partner since 1987 has been Sigrid Nama, a Danish-Flemish-American art dealer, whom he met when giving a reading in Pittsburgh that year. </p> <p>Walcott has included a fair amount of autobiographical content in his poems over the years but all this material was yet to come when he self-published his first collection, 25 Poems, in 1948. It was funded by a $200 gift from his mother and was printed to look as much like a Faber &amp; Faber book as possible. This arrangement wasn't unusual in the Caribbean; VS Naipaul's father had paid for the publication of his first book of short stories. </p> <p>Walcott's first collection of poems published outside the Caribbean was In a Green Night in 1962. Tom Maschler had recently joined Jonathan Cape and was on the lookout for young poets. Alan Ross, editor of The London Magazine, had published some of Walcott's work and put his name forward. \"With fiction I am a totally confident judge,\" says Maschler. \"I don't know in the same way with poetry, but I did like the book enormously. But I must admit I didn't have any idea he would become such a significant figure. If we had published Seamus Heaney I think I would have been waiting for him to win the Nobel Prize. But while I did know that Derek was a very important poet, I didn't know then just how important he would be.\" </p> <p>Walcott, although a new name in England, was already at this stage a significant mature artist in the Caribbean, and as early as 1964 he was able to publish his Selected Poems. He went on to build his reputation with a series of acclaimed collections that extended his work from the early celebrations of Caribbean landscape. Both The Castaway (1965) and The Gulf (1969) deal with his personal anxieties in being pulled both by the European tradition and his native culture. Another Life, his 1973 book-length autobiographical poem, saw his breakthrough in terms of critical respect, and his reputation was further secured with The Star-Apple Kingdom in 1979, in which he probed the many strata of Caribbean society in terms of language, race and culture. </p> <p>By this time Walcott, although maintaining strong links with Trinidad and St Lucia, was essentially living in America. After the false start of his first visit in the late 50s, he was by now increasingly an insider in the east coast literary establishment. He was invited to contribute to the influential liberal journal Partisan Review and also for the New York Review of Books. The poet Robert Lowell champi oned his work, and they became friends. </p> <p>Walcott was by now doing more readings in America and had begun to teach at prestigious American universities. First at Rutgers, then Yale, Columbia, Harvard, and since 1982 at Boston University, where he is a professor of English and teaches a postgraduate theatre course. Walcott's own poetry has long been seen as ideally suited to black and post-colonial literature courses, but he has always distanced himself from what he sees as a ghetto mentality. He has always written in English, although he often uses the rhythms of the French Creole he spoke alongside English as a boy. \"I hate all that nonsense about not touching the colonialists' lan guage. All that about it being corrupting and belonging to the master and making you Caliban. That thinking just denies you an outlet. You deny everything that is great from a language, whether it is Conrad or Shakespeare.\" </p> <p>It saddens him that some African-American literature is seen as being different from American literature. \"I think that is baffling and wrong. If you think of American literature up to about 1920, Jews were not thought to be part of it. Now look at American literature: Roth, Mailer, Bellow. That is what American literature is. Some people say that these Jewish writers were white so it is a different issue, but it wasn't like that at the time. Jewish writers were really excluded from the concept of American literature.\" </p> <p>Dabydeen sees this approach as part of his commitment to the highest standards. \"He really believes that writing is about craft. You must have syllabic intelligence, you must know rhythm and where a line ends. In other words you can't slap words down on a page and call it dub. That is black performance fuckery. It's just not good enough to throw in a bit of Creole and think you can get away with it.\" </p> <p>Walcott has been widely seen as dismissive of the political correctness on some American campuses. His friends say he can be flirtatious, enjoys double entendres and sexual jokes, and likes to test people out with outrageous statements. This style got him into trouble. In 1982 a student at Harvard complained that he propositioned her and that after she rebuffed him he reduced her grade. When the Harvard authorities changed the student's grade, both Joseph Brodsky and Susan Sontag wrote complaining that this was a slur on Walcott's integrity. In 1996 a former student at Boston University claimed that he refused to produce her play after she turned him down. The university stood by him and the case was settled out of court. Both incidents put huge pressure on Walcott, and for a time his career and future employment prospects were in jeopardy. It was believed that the incidents also counted against him last year when the new British poet laureate was named. Walcott had made no secret of the fact that he would have liked the job. </p> <p>\"I thought it would have expanded the idea of the laureateship in a nice way,\" he says. \"I'm still amazed and thrilled that the captain of the English cricket team is of Indian descent and when I see black footballers playing for England. Twenty or 30 years ago that would not have been possible, so I was flattered that I was being considered.\" </p> <p>The man who got the job, Andrew Motion, is a great admirer of Walcott's work: \"In a literary culture often connected with academies it would be easy to see his work as ideally suited to certain courses. But he has the freedom of imagination to engage with other things too. Those easily spotted themes in fact take their place with an almost limitless number of other themes and interests and that is a sign of a real quality.\" </p> <p>Walcott's 1988 collection, The Arkansas Testament, had received mixed reviews, but in 1990 his refashioning of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey in a 20th-century Caribbean fishing setting, Omeros, was widely acclaimed. Hermione Lee was one of the judges who awarded the WHSmith book award to Walcott that year. \"I think Omeros is one of the great epic poems of the 20th century,\" she says. \"There is a wonderful hubris about the work which is true of the man. Even in a five-minute meeting you can see he is a person of enormous boldness and grandeur. He does a big number both as a writer and a person.\" </p> <p>Lee has taught Omeros to her students at Oxford. She says that some of the more feminist students do find him quite macho and difficult. \"He very much writes about the male ego and produces a sort of autobiography of the male epic poet. It is a very physical, active and heroic idea of poetry. It is not Emily Dickinson.\" </p> <p>The poem, however, has not met with universal approval. The poet and critic Craig Raine, in his literary magazine Aret\u00e9, recently subjected it to forensic levels of close reading and found a series of anomalies and repetitions. A canoe lost on page 50 is sold on page 116. Eyes are described as slitted on seven occasions. Raine also sees Walcott as being too \"touched\" by other poets: Dylan Thomas, Hopkins, Auden, Yeats, Lowell, Heaney and Brodsky. \"The clich\u00e9d colonial paradigm of invasion and conquest has been fulfilled aesthetically,\" says Raine, before conceding that this is \"odd, given that Walcott's pronouncements on the colonial past and its role in the present are so eminently sensible.\" </p> <p>For all that, the publication of Omeros is widely seen as the clinching factor in Walcott being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992. He says that even now he is still coming to terms with the \"width of the prize\". Apart from fish cakes and squares being named after him, his face also appears on stamps and phonecards in St Lucia. Friends say that his experiences in America and demands made on him after winning the prize have made him more cautious about people and more determined to continue to write and not let his achievements become set in stone. </p> <p>\"He is driven by a need to establish himself in terms of history,\" says King. \"Some writers in old age will turn to meditation or ping pong or something, but Derek just isn't like that. He is a writer and an intellectual. Derek read and wrote serious books and serious literature and that was his life. That's not to say he doesn't watch comedy shows or basketball on television. But he has never enjoyed going to cocktail parties or having dinner with strangers.\" </p> <p>Dabydeen applauds the fact that Walcott has produced some of his strongest work since receiving the prize. \"When you get the Nobel Prize, usually for the rest of your career people are waiting for the work to be rubbish, but he has gone from strength to strength. He really does believe that writing is a sacred calling and he doesn't judge himself by contemporary standards. He really worries whether what he has written can measure up to Shakespeare.\" </p> <p>Walcott's time is currently spent travelling the world giving readings and commuting between his homes in St Lucia and New York. He is painting, writing a screenplay about a steel band and \"fiddling around\" with several plays, as well as constructing verse. He is obviously committed to his calling, but has had his doubts. Towards the end of Omeros, Walcott breaks off from the hurtling narrative to question his role as a poet: </p> <p> What I had read and rewritten till literature was guilty as History. When would the sails drop from from my eyes, when would I not hear the Trojan War in two fishermen cursing in Ma Kilman's shop? When would my head shake off its echoes like a horse shaking off a wreath of flies? When would it stop, the echo in the throat, insisting, 'Omeros'; when would I enter that light beyond metaphor? </p> <p>His answer is the scale of achievement in the poem itself. But he has also put it rather more succinctly when he saluted another writer torn between cultures, his friend and fellow Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. \"Poetry is still treason,\" wrote Walcott, \"because it is truth.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Derek Alton Walcott </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> January 23 1930, Castries, St Lucia. </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> St Mary's College, St Lucia; University of West Indies, Jamaica. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1954 Fay Moston, (one son), divorced. 1962 Margaret Maillard, (two daughters), divorced. 1977 Norline Metivier, divorced. </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> Teacher at schools in St Lucia and Grenada; lecturer at Kingston College, Jamaica; Rutgers University; Yale University; Columbia University; Harvard University; Boston University. </p> <p><strong> Essays:</strong> 1998 What the Twilight Says. </p> <p><strong> Poetry:</strong> 1948 25 Poems; 1962 In a Green Night; 1964 Selected Poems; 1965 The Castaway; 1969 The Gulf; 1973 Another Life; 1976 Sea Grapes; 1979 The Star-Apple Kingdom; 1981 The Fortunate Traveller; 1984 Midsummer; 1986 Collected Poems; 1987 The Arkansas Testament; 1990 Omeros; 1997 The Bounty; 2000 Tiepolo's Hound. </p> <p><strong> Plays:</strong> 1952 Harry Dernier; 1957 Ti-Jean; 1970 Dream on Monkey Mountain; 1978 The Joker of Seville; 1980 Remembrance; 1993 Odyssey. </p> <p><strong> Awards:</strong> 1989 Queen's Gold Medal for poetry; 1992 Nobel Prize for literature. </p> <p>\u0095 Tiepolo's Hound is published by Faber and Faber at \u00a320.

      "bodyText": "When Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992 the citation said he was honoured \"for a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment.\" This vision and commitment were forged in the extraordinary cultural melting pot that is the Caribbean. There is English, Dutch, Creole and African all represented within two generations of his lineage. He was brought up in a British colony as an English-speaking Methodist, but St Lucia was mostly a Creole-speaking Catholic island. In social terms he was from an intellectual elite, while economically he was harshly poor. Black and white have of course played a big part in Walcott's life, but it is the colours in between that have defined the man and his work. Or as he put it in his 1979 autobiographical poem The Schooner Flight: I'm just a red nigger who love the sea, I had a sound colonial education, I have Dutch, nigger and English in me, and either I'm nobody, or I'm a nation. The writer Marina Warner first saw Walcott at a reading in a former 18th-century prison in Dublin. \"He read a section of his poem Omeros where a woman opens a box and the whole of the empire spills out in these rolling stanzas packed with colonial symbolism,\" she recalls. \"Derek was surrounded by portraits of Lord Lieutenants of Ireland in their uniforms and medals. To see him reading these lines there, in his wonderful, rumbling Paul Robeson style of delivery, was a marvellous moment. It really was history talking back.\" Warner points out that he is simultaneously a profound critic of how the Caribbean has been treated by empire but is also very aware of the cultural legacy and riches that connection brings. \"He operates within this interesting contradiction all the time. He has a white grandfather and has green eyes. He is the patchwork quilt of the Caribbean.\" The novelist Caryl Phillips claims that Walcott \"has shown that there is a sense of what I would call 'big history' in the region, rather than seeing it as a set of scattered islands off the United States where small history happens. This is a place where much larger forces are at work.\" Poet David Dabydeen, who like Phillips was born in the region, notes that Walcott's approval for things like his \"sound colonial education\" can make him unpopular with \"people who believe in an easy flag-waving and drum-beating nationalism\". But while his work combines forms from English, Russian and Greek poetry, it also contains Caribbean rhythms and sensibility, explains Dabydeen. \"He shows that the seemingly diverse traditions of Creole and Mediterranean are not so diverse after all. The fact is that Europe is there in the form of the English, the Spanish, the French and the Dutch.\" Walcott's latest work, the 160-page poem Tiepolo's Hound, is another boldly ambitious explication of the synthesis between the Caribbean and the western world. It tells the story of the impressionist painter Camille Pissaro, a Sephardic Jew who was brought up on the Caribbean island of St Thomas, went to France in his mid-20s and helped to change the face of European art. The poem also tells the story of Walcott, another outsider and artist working against the prevailing fashions who left his Caribbean home to pursue his visions. As a young man Walcott considered being a professional painter, and the poem is illustrated with his work. \"But the text does says how hard I find painting and how much of it is failure,\" he quickly explains. \"It's not saying here's Pissaro and here's me. But it does show the relationship between the writing and the painting.\" Walcott covers some interesting art historical ground and makes a good case that Pissaro's wintry depictions of Paris are infused with Caribbean colouring. But it is the key question of why Pissaro chose to leave the region that most preoccupies him. It is quintessential Walcott material. \"There was no reason why he should have stayed in St Thomas,\" he says. \"If it is possible to feel bored and restless with contemporary St Thomas, imagine how it felt 150 years ago. Of course there's the business of him being white and Jewish, and it may be an anachronistic question or the wrong question about the wrong time. But I am still interested in the idea of why he went. I wonder whether painting that landscape and the black faces was ever a real choice for him. Was it considered a proper subject or was that at the time completely out of the question.\" Bruce King has written a major biography of Walcott that will be published by Oxford University Press in October. In Tiepolo's Hound, he sees Walcott again putting the West Indies at the centre of history rather than tangential to it. \"This is the real difference between him and Naipaul. Naipaul sees Trinidad as a backwater and Derek says, 'No, we are part of world culture. A lot of things have happened here.' Just because they don't have an economic base it will always be difficult to talk about West Indian independence, and perhaps it will always be a colony in an economic sense. But culturally it is amazing what has been produced there. And this is what he sees himself contributing to. To dismiss it all like Naipaul does is absurd.\" According to Caryl Phillips, Walcott has, almost single-handedly, created a poetic tradition in the Caribbean. That has been both a help and a hindrance to him. \"If you are working in the shadow of Yeats or Wordsworth you always have someone to measure yourself against. You are not on what Heaney calls 'a peasant's pilgrimage'. But Derek didn't have that comforting notion that there had been people before him. It makes what he has done even more remarkable.\" Dabydeen says Walcott's impact on the status of Caribbean writing has been profound. \"When he won the Nobel Prize in 1992 we all won the Nobel Prize. The symbolism of this on the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the region was immense. There is enormous local pride. There is a fish cake named after him in St Lucia, Columbus Square is now Walcott Square, and he carries all this with a great deal of the humility.\" In a sense Walcott was born into the cultural officer class of the region. His people were the teachers, preachers and local administrators. His father, Warwick Walcott, was a civil servant working for the attorney general. He was an opera fan, had a sizeable library, wrote poetry and painted. He was a significant figure in the local artistic scene and had set up a literary society and staged plays. His mother, Alix, was a headmistress. Derek and his twin brother Roderick, a theatre director who died earlier this year, were born in the largest town in St Lucia, Castries, in 1930. They had one older sister. Their father died when the boys were aged one, leaving his wife to bring up the children during a depression. Alix Walcott was an extremely forceful woman and very well read. Walcott remembers her singing Methodist hymns around the house and reciting great chunks of poetry and prose. \"Things like Cardinal Wolsey's farewell speech. She knew a lot of Portia's speeches and had played her in a production put on by my father. She was a real ham and a performer, and I always hoped that one day she would recite something of mine like that.\" In order to provide for the family she took in sewing work, but Walcott says he wasn't conscious of any deprivation. \"My mother hid the struggle from us children. She complained about her salary and she had a tough time. Although she became a headmistress she still had to do a lot of sewing. The more I think about her the more remarkable I realise she was. And she understood straight away when I said that I wanted to write.\" Walcott was also encouraged at his school, St Mary's College, by some of the younger teachers and the headmaster. \"They made me feel that this is what I should do. The headmaster asked to read one of my poems at some celebration or other when I was about 10. When I look back that is phenomenal encouragement.\" By the age of 14 his precocity had sparked an island row when a priest accused him of heresy after one of his poems, which said that God could be better found through nature than through preaching, was published in the local newspaper. Walcott's education was, apart from its location, identical to that of middle-class children in England at the time, and the travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, who visited the school in the early 50s, noted that \"it had a completely English atmosphere\". Astonishingly this tiny island school has produced two Nobel Prize winners, Walcott and the 1979 economics laureate Sir Arthur Lewis. Coincidentally they were both born on January 23. Walcott just missed out on the island scholarship to Oxford because he was bad at mathematics and so went to the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, where he studied French, Latin and Spanish. \"I don't know what would have happened to me as a writer if I had gone to England and shaped my life out of England. Of course I will never know, but I think I prefer what did happen.\" He says had a terrific time at university but didn't do any work, preferring to spend his time in the drama group and writing for the newspaper. \"There was the excitement of a new Caribbean being created,\" he says. \"There were new writers and artists emerging. Obviously colonialism was there and racism and history and so on. We had our anger, but it was kind of great to be angry - it had its own vigour. It wasn't at all sour or vengeful.\" After university he taught in schools in St Lucia, Grenada and Jamaica, as well as contributing articles and reviews to papers in Trinidad and Jamaica. In 1953 he went to live in Trinidad, where he continued to write poetry and plays. He and his brother had always written small plays which they performed themselves in the house. His first publicly performed plays were put on in St. Lucia in 1950. Later that year he won a Rockefeller scholarship to study theatre in New York. Walcott ended that trip early after suffering from homesickness but has subsequently worked a great deal in American theatre. In 1998 he was the co-lyricist in Capeman, Paul Simon's $11m Broadway debacle. It was based on the life of Puerto Rican Salvador Agr\u00f3n, who as a 16-year-old in the 1950s had murdered two white teenagers while wearing a red satin cape. The case had become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for radicals in the 60s and the musical attracted massive publicity. When it closed after just two months it was the most expensive failure in Broadway history. Even before its spectacular collapse Walcott had begun to dissociate himself from the show, complaining that his work was being butchered by the succession of directors brought in to salvage it. Ultimately he regarded the project as a waste of four years' work. When Walcott returned to Trinidad in 1959 he formed the Trinidad Theatre Workshop. It celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. \"We've had some terrific actors,\" he says. \"People sometimes dismiss it because it is not a professional theatre, but that's just because the economic context means it can't sustain professional theatre, it doesn't mean the performances are not first class.\" When Walcott's play, Ti-Jean, was performed in Central Park in New York in the early 1970s, two of the actors, Hamilton Parris and Albert Laveau, attracted rave reviews - better than those for the play itself. The theatre's reputation for excellence has since attracted overseas directors like the RSC's Terry Hands and Greg Doran, and the company has won awards when touring in America. But Walcott has still had to fight a long, bitter and largely unsuccessful battle with the Trinidad authorities to obtain state funding for what is a national theatre in all but name. \"The quality of literature that has come out of the Caribbean over the last 40 years has been phenomenal,\" he says. \"Who could have foreseen that a place like Trinidad, which is of the scale of some English counties, could have produced both Naipaul and CLR James? And there is equivalent potential there in the theatre. You would think that a society would say that art is as necessary as roads and sewage. But the attitude is that art is an amateur activity, which is not just short-sighted thinking, it is illiterate and ignorant thinking.\" Caryl Phillips sees why he is so angry. \"It's not as if vast amounts of money are needed, but even this wasn't forthcoming. It has grated on him as an individual. He made very early on a serious commitment to the Caribbean in terms not just of his aesthetic but also the physical and emotional trajectory of his life.\" This emotional trajectory has not been straightforward, and his professional and domestic life have often been stormy. Until he won the Nobel Prize he had been consistently short of money. His health was put under pressure by heavy drinking and smoking. He is now diabetic and no longer does either. His first marriage was in 1954 to Fay Moston, a secretary from a wealthy Jamaican family. They had one son, now a painter living in St Lucia, the following year, but the marriage broke up in 1956. His second wife, Margaret Maillard, was an almoner in a hos pital in Port of Spain, Trinidad. She was also active in the Trinidad arts scene as a dancer and a painter, and the couple shocked local opinion by living together before getting married. They have two daughters; one is now at university and the other works for an advertising company. Walcott has three grandchildren. His marriage to Margaret, shaky since the late 60s, broke up after he had an affair in the mid-70s with a young dancer in one of his plays, Norline Metivier. He married her in 1976, but that also ended in divorce. His partner since 1987 has been Sigrid Nama, a Danish-Flemish-American art dealer, whom he met when giving a reading in Pittsburgh that year. Walcott has included a fair amount of autobiographical content in his poems over the years but all this material was yet to come when he self-published his first collection, 25 Poems, in 1948. It was funded by a $200 gift from his mother and was printed to look as much like a Faber &amp; Faber book as possible. This arrangement wasn't unusual in the Caribbean; VS Naipaul's father had paid for the publication of his first book of short stories. Walcott's first collection of poems published outside the Caribbean was In a Green Night in 1962. Tom Maschler had recently joined Jonathan Cape and was on the lookout for young poets.

A canoe lost on page 50 is sold on page 116. Eyes are described as slitted on seven occasions. Raine also sees Walcott as being too \"touched\" by other poets: Dylan Thomas, Hopkins, Auden, Yeats, Lowell, Heaney and Brodsky. \"The clich\u00e9d colonial paradigm of invasion and conquest has been fulfilled aesthetically,\" says Raine, before conceding that this is \"odd, given that Walcott's pronouncements on the colonial past and its role in the present are so eminently sensible.\" For all that, the publication of Omeros is widely seen as the clinching factor in Walcott being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992. He says that even now he is still coming to terms with the \"width of the prize\". Apart from fish cakes and squares being named after him, his face also appears on stamps and phonecards in St Lucia. Friends say that his experiences in America and demands made on him after winning the prize have made him more cautious about people and more determined to continue to write and not let his achievements become set in stone. \"He is driven by a need to establish himself in terms of history,\" says King. \"Some writers in old age will turn to meditation or ping pong or something, but Derek just isn't like that. He is a writer and an intellectual. Derek read and wrote serious books and serious literature and that was his life. That's not to say he doesn't watch comedy shows or basketball on television. But he has never enjoyed going to cocktail parties or having dinner with strangers.\" Dabydeen applauds the fact that Walcott has produced some of his strongest work since receiving the prize. \"When you get the Nobel Prize, usually for the rest of your career people are waiting for the work to be rubbish, but he has gone from strength to strength. He really does believe that writing is a sacred calling and he doesn't judge himself by contemporary standards. He really worries whether what he has written can measure up to Shakespeare.\" Walcott's time is currently spent travelling the world giving readings and commuting between his homes in St Lucia and New York. He is painting, writing a screenplay about a steel band and \"fiddling around\" with several plays, as well as constructing verse. He is obviously committed to his calling, but has had his doubts. Towards the end of Omeros, Walcott breaks off from the hurtling narrative to question his role as a poet: What I had read and rewritten till literature was guilty as History. When would the sails drop from from my eyes, when would I not hear the Trojan War in two fishermen cursing in Ma Kilman's shop? When would my head shake off its echoes like a horse shaking off a wreath of flies? When would it stop, the echo in the throat, insisting, 'Omeros'; when would I enter that light beyond metaphor? His answer is the scale of achievement in the poem itself. But he has also put it rather more succinctly when he saluted another writer torn between cultures, his friend and fellow Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. \"Poetry is still treason,\" wrote Walcott, \"because it is truth.\" Life at a glance: Derek Alton Walcott Born: January 23 1930, Castries, St Lucia.

Her suffering and the threat to her professional career send a message to every teacher in Wales and England. The case demonstrates how vulnerable teachers are. They need greater protection and that requires that their professional judgment to exclude a pupil must be upheld.\"</p> <p>Mrs Evans, of Usk, south Wales, had been found guilty of common assault at Abergavenny magistrates court in July. Stipendiary magistrate Vivian Manning-Davies found that she had momentarily lost control and slapped the boy across the face when he became abusive after being told he could not go swimming with other members of his class.</p> <p>The decision sent shock waves through the profession. Mrs Evans launched an immediate appeal, insisting that she had not slapped the boy but had restrained him when he tried to push, punch and head butt her.</p> <p>Yesterday, after two days of evidence including a videoed police interview with the boy not shown at the first hearing, Mr Justice McKinnon, sitting with two magistrates, quashed the earlier verdict saying he could not understand how it was that Mrs Evans had come to be convicted.</p> <p>He said the boy's evidence was \"deeply flawed.\" It was, he said \"entirely significant\" that the boy had talked in the video interview of a plan to get Mrs Evans out of the school.</p> <p>He rejected the account of events given by another boy who gave evidence for the prosecution and found special needs teacher, Sandra Cutler, who said she had heard Mrs Evans admit slapping the boy, to be \"an unreliable witness\".</p> <p>The judge told the court: \"In our judgment the appellant was faced with a disruptive and difficult pupil. When he went to attack her, as she described, by trying to push her, punch her and head butt her she administered the entirely appropriate and approved restraint hold, took him to the staff room and calmed him down.</p> <p>\"The appellant leaves this court with her very good character entirely intact and without any blemish whatever upon it.\"</p> <p>At a press conference, Mrs Evans spoke of her relief at being cleared but expressed concern that other innocent teachers would be put through the same ordeal.</p> <p>She said she felt hurt and upset that the education authority had not made further investigations into the incident before it got to court but expressed gratitude for the support she had received from governors, teachers and parents at the school.</p> <p>\"Teaching has been my life, it has meant everything to me,\" she told reporters. \"I just couldn't believe that the very good record I had had been damned by one 10-year-old boy who was making malicious allegations.\"</p> <p>Deidre Davies, a secondary teacher from Abergavenny who launched a fighting fund for Mrs Evans in the wake of the first court case, said teachers in the area felt \"sheer delight\" at the appeal verdict.</p> <p>But she said they remained concerned that the case had gone to court at all. \"There are a lot of issues that need addressing because this has opened up a whole can of worms about the need for more supervision in classrooms where you have got emotionally disturbed and badly behaved children.\"</p> <p>David Paddison, of Robertsons, the solicitors brought in by the NUT to act for Mrs Evans, said teachers were particularly vulnerable to fabricated allegations of assault.</p> <p>The school standards minister, Estelle Morris, said: \"This is a sensible decision.\"</p>",

Mr McAvoy, who attended the first day of the three-day hearing in a public show of support, said teachers throughout the country would celebrate. \"Marjorie Evans has suffered greatly over recent months. Her suffering and the threat to her professional career send a message to every teacher in Wales and England. The case demonstrates how vulnerable teachers are. They need greater protection and that requires that their professional judgment to exclude a pupil must be upheld.\" Mrs Evans, of Usk, south Wales, had been found guilty of common assault at Abergavenny magistrates court in July. Stipendiary magistrate Vivian Manning-Davies found that she had momentarily lost control and slapped the boy across the face when he became abusive after being told he could not go swimming with other members of his class. The decision sent shock waves through the profession. Mrs Evans launched an immediate appeal, insisting that she had not slapped the boy but had restrained him when he tried to push, punch and head butt her. Yesterday, after two days of evidence including a videoed police interview with the boy not shown at the first hearing, Mr Justice McKinnon, sitting with two magistrates, quashed the earlier verdict saying he could not understand how it was that Mrs Evans had come to be convicted. He said the boy's evidence was \"deeply flawed.\" It was, he said \"entirely significant\" that the boy had talked in the video interview of a plan to get Mrs Evans out of the school. He rejected the account of events given by another boy who gave evidence for the prosecution and found special needs teacher, Sandra Cutler, who said she had heard Mrs Evans admit slapping the boy, to be \"an unreliable witness\". The judge told the court: \"In our judgment the appellant was faced with a disruptive and difficult pupil. When he went to attack her, as she described, by trying to push her, punch her and head butt her she administered the entirely appropriate and approved restraint hold, took him to the staff room and calmed him down. \"The appellant leaves this court with her very good character entirely intact and without any blemish whatever upon it.\" At a press conference, Mrs Evans spoke of her relief at being cleared but expressed concern that other innocent teachers would be put through the same ordeal. She said she felt hurt and upset that the education authority had not made further investigations into the incident before it got to court but expressed gratitude for the support she had received from governors, teachers and parents at the school. \"Teaching has been my life, it has meant everything to me,\" she told reporters. \"I just couldn't believe that the very good record I had had been damned by one 10-year-old boy who was making malicious allegations.\" Deidre Davies, a secondary teacher from Abergavenny who launched a fighting fund for Mrs Evans in the wake of the first court case, said teachers in the area felt \"sheer delight\" at the appeal verdict. But she said they remained concerned that the case had gone to court at all. \"There are a lot of issues that need addressing because this has opened up a whole can of worms about the need for more supervision in classrooms where you have got emotionally disturbed and badly behaved children.\" David Paddison, of Robertsons, the solicitors brought in by the NUT to act for Mrs Evans, said teachers were particularly vulnerable to fabricated allegations of assault. The school standards minister, Estelle Morris, said: \"This is a sensible decision.\"",

There are no horned helms and battle axes but the 39-year old Swede is leading his invasion on the London Stock Exchange with the weapons of the 21st century - tough words, modern technology and cash. Like Nordic raiders before him, he has found his enemy unready. </p> <p>The City has seen nothing like it. Never before has a hostile bid been launched for a stock exchange anywhere in the world. With his \u00a3808m offer, Larsson has thrown the City's old-boy network, which for centuries has run the London exchange like a gentleman's club, into a spin. </p> <p>Larsson modestly understates the impact of his broadside against the 200-year-old London exchange. Without a hint of expression in his voice, Larsson says: \"I can understand the element of surprise. It was a very big surprise\". </p> <p>While the element of surprise helps in every battle, Larsson's attack had more unexpected features than most. First, OM Gruppen, the Stockholm-based company of which he is chief executive, had barely registered in the minds of the City's highest echelons until news of the bid broke last week. Second, it was a bid by a company set up only 15 years ago for an exchange with a reputation spanning more than two centuries and by far the largest in Europe. The London exchange claims to have 34% share of the European market compared with OM's 5%. Third, the London exchange was in the throes of putting together a merger with its German rival which, albeit unpopular, was about to announce its trump card - a dramatic reduction in the cost of trading across national boundaries. </p> <p>With one strike, Larsson has put the brakes on the Anglo-German merger, winning praise from disgruntled shareholders in London who had wanted more time to consider the plan. The vote on the merger has been postponed from September 14 and looks unlikely to take place until the end of the year. </p> <p>Larsson is now embarked on a gruelling offensive which, while not intended to cause bloodshed, will certainly involve some brutal, bruising encounters with his counterparts at the London exchange. </p> <p>Don Cruickshank, the chairman of the exchange, did not even attend the meeting at which Larsson and his advisers tried to broker a friendly deal. </p> <p>Larsson's argument for taking control of the exchange is littered with technical details about liquidity and technology. </p> <p>He insists the Anglo-German plan to form iX is deeply flawed. For a start, it involves the London exchange throwing away its name. </p> <p>\"Brand is important. We Europeans tend to undervalue the importance of the brand. The London Stock Exchange is one of the strongest brands in the financial markets. To give that up in iX, we just don't understand,\" he says. </p> <p>At the heart of his argument is the battle over liquidity in the market place, the nitty-gritty detail of where deals to buy and trade shares are done. </p> <p>\"We have a view on the future that exchanges will compete about liquidity,\" he says, rubbishing the idea that exchanges need to merge to achieve that goal. </p> <p>Such is his passion about the lack of need for mergers that he walked out of a meeting 18 months ago in Paris where the London and German exchanges were trying to broker a deal between all of the exchanges in Europe to form an alliance. </p> <p><strong> Fighting to survive</strong><br> </p> <p>\"Even before the meeting started they wanted us to sign a press release. We left the meeting,\" he says, describing OM as the \"outsider\". </p> <p>He fails to see the logic of trying to get Europe's exchanges to sit around the same table and agree on the way forward. \"Our fundamental view is that you can't take eight or 15 national monopolies to create a new monopoly,\" he says. Critics might argue, however, that the exchanges are not seeking to create another monopoly but are fighting to survive in a battle for market share. </p> <p>If iX gets off the ground it will still face competition. The most obvious source is Euronext, the alliance of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels exchanges.

For large IPOs (initial public offerings of shares) London should be the natural centre. </p> <p>\"Somewhere in between, there will be small, local centres,\" he says. As smaller companies develop on domestic markets they may migrate towards the bigger market in London.

      "bodyText": "The runway from which the doomed Air France Concorde took off last month had not been fully checked for debris for more than 12 hours, French accident investigators said yesterday. Their preliminary report into the July 25 crash, triggered by a stray 16-inch (41cm) strip of metal on the runway that slashed one of the supersonic jet's tyres, showed that routine inspection had been delayed for a fire practice. \"There was a firemen's drill and the runway inspection was postponed,\" Paul-Louis Arslanian, head of France's Air Accident Investigation Bureau admitted yesterday, a day after the interim report was released. Mr Arslanian said airport staff routinely inspect the runways three times a day at irregular intervals, but that on July 25 only one full inspection was was carried out, at 4.30am, followed by a partial inspection of the west side of the runway soon after midday. The third inspection, planned for about 3pm, was delayed for a 35-minute fire drill. The ill-fated Air France Concorde took off at 4.42pm, already spouting flames from its left wing, and ploughed into a hotel in Gonesse, just outside Paris, less than two minutes later, killing all 113 crew and passengers. A Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport spokesman, Didier Hamon, said only two runway inspections a day were required by law. But a spokeswoman for the British Airports Authority (BAA) said: \"We carry out about five inspections under normal circumstances. All the inspections are the same, take around 45 minutes to complete and are done throughout the day, but not at any set time. \"A 12-hour delay between inspections would not happen at Heathrow,\" the spokeswoman said. But while the delayed inspection may have had a crucial bearing on the causes of this accident, investigators said the revelation shed little light on whether burst tyres are an inherent threat to Concorde - the concern that prompted British and French aviation authorities to withdraw the supersonic jet's airworthiness certificate last month. \"What is important is to know what has happened, to determine the exact scenario that linked the destruction of the tyre to the fire, and to understand what caused the disturbances to the engines,\" Mr Arslanian said. He cautioned against drawing any hasty conclusions. Since the early days of the investigation, experts have said that the metal strip, painted red on one side and yellow on another and apparently not belonging to the Concorde, probably caused the tyre to explode. The original source of the strip, however, has never been identified. Mr Arslanian said he is hopeful that the source will soon be found. \"I am confident that if someone finds that it fell off his plane, he will not conceal it,\" he said. The preliminary report largely confirmed the theory of the strip causing a puncture, saying the front right tyre of the left undercarriage \"was destroyed, very likely by passing over a piece of metal\". Large chunks of rubber were then hurled up into the aircraft's left wing, rupturing the fuel tanks and sparking the catastrophic fire. The report contained photographs of a shredded Concorde tyre with a 12-inch (30cm) tear, and of the bent metal strip. Mr Hamon insisted nothing exceptional had been reported on the runway on the fatal day, either by the pilots using it or by the cleaners and fire servicemen who were on it in the hours leading up to the crash. \"If anything wrong had existed, it would have been noticed immediately,\" he said. \"We do believe that everything was done that day as it is normal to do,\" he added. \"On that day, nothing abnormal, nothing exceptional was reported to the airport authority.\"",

Most pig farmers used to insure against swine fever but the slump in the market in the last two years and the fact that there had been no outbreak in Britain for 14 years had led farmers to drop the insurance to cut costs. After negotiations with the European commission, Mr Brown has offered \u00a335 for animals which weighed over 60kg and \u00a310 for smaller pigs based on cost of extra feed and welfare not on market value. A government and industry joint working party is now looking at the issue of swine fever insurance to guard agaist another disaster for individuals farmers in the event of another outbreak. The European Union partly lifted its ban on the export of live English pigs and pig semen last week, following an outbreak of swine fever in East Anglia at the start of August, but animals from Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex remain subject to curbs. Mr Godfrey said last night that many pig farmers were \"already beyond their credit limits with banks and feed suppliers, following the worst two years of trading on record.\" The Ministry of Agriculture said it was impossible to make 100% compensation payments because it would have breach European Union rules on fair competition. \"We have to justify our rationale for making these payments to the commission, which was very concerned that what we were doing was not some backdoor business loss compensation payment,\" said a spokesman.",

A total of 196 policy ideas were contained in the Ideas Book 2000, including a commitment to building world class public services with an \u00a38bn increase in spending on the national health service. The 41-page document contained numerous populist measures to deal with the \"little annoyances of everyday life\", such as banning wheel clamps, and a ban on gazumping on house purchases. There were also calls for a return to old-style navy blue British passports and for pensioners to be given free postage stamps at Christmas. Among the key policy ideas offered to Mr Hague was the suggestion that patients have the right to more information on the performance of individual hospitals and units. The policy document also calls for huge savings to be made in welfare provisions, with no entitlement to unemployment benefits for the first fortnight. On transport policy, the Bow Group proposes raising the speed limit on motorways to 80mph and charging utilities and other companies by each square foot of road or pavement they have dug up until the work is finished.

      "body": "<p>Householders could one day be producing as much electricity as all the country's nuclear power stations combined, thanks to the revolutionary application of a device developed in the early 19th century. </p> <p>A new version of the device, the Stirling engine, is set to turn ordinary domestic gas boilers into miniature power stations, generating electricity whenever you switch on the central heating or hot water. </p> <p>It won't make electricity meters run backwards. But for an estimated \u00a3500 extra on the price of a new boiler, the machine will generate electricity for the home for nothing, using excess heat that would otherwise escape out the flue. </p> <p>In Britain, a confidential report prepared for electricity companies by energy consultants EA Technology estimates that by 2025, 13m of the country's 23m households could have their own little power station humming away in the boiler cupboard. </p> <p>The Stirling engine was patented in 1816 by a Scottish clergyman, Robert Stirling. It consists of two cylinders, filled with gas, each containing a piston. The cylinders are heated and cooled in turn, making the pistons move up and down to turn a drive shaft. </p> <p>In existing domestic gas boilers, about a third of the heat is wasted. With the latest make of Stirling engine fitted, that spare heat is used to drive a small generator. </p> <p>The idea of turning homes into power stations is known as \"micro chp\" (combined heat and power). </p> <p>EA Technology is championing a Stirling engine made by WhisperTech, a New Zealand company, which can generate a kilowatt of electricity - enough to power three fridges. </p> <p>British Gas is working on a different design with a similar power output, based on an engine from the US firm SunPower. </p> <p>\"We have now got to the stage where we've overcome the technical barriers, and it's simply a matter of product development, things like designing the right colour for the casing,\" said EA Technology's Jeremy Harrison. </p> <p>He said the first units would be on sale in 2002. Depending on the size of the home, he said, they would save householders between \u00a3150 and \u00a3300 a year on their electricity bills. </p> <p>The beauty of micro chp is that it cuts in when demand on the grid from households is greatest. On a summer's afternoon, with the fridge on and the TV and VCR on standby, a household might be using only a few hundred watts of electricity. </p> <p>On a winter's evening, with kettles, electric cookers, irons, washing machines and tumble dryers working, that might rise to 20 kilowatts. But with the central heating and hot water on, the home would be generating its own electricity, lightening the load on the grid, the family budget, and the environment. </p> <p>EA Technology estimates that at peak times, a network of 13m households would generate 15,000 to 23,000 megawatts of electricity, compared with 15,000 megawatts produced by the country's nuclear power stations. </p> <p>However, if the government wanted to promote micro chp specifically as a way of cutting down on the carbon dioxide emissions held responsible for global warming, it would need to close high-emitting coal-fired power stations, rather than nuclear ones. </p> <p>The government has been keen to promote chp as a means of implementing the 1997 Kyoto protocols, which called for reductions in carbon emissions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Householders could one day be producing as much electricity as all the country's nuclear power stations combined, thanks to the revolutionary application of a device developed in the early 19th century. A new version of the device, the Stirling engine, is set to turn ordinary domestic gas boilers into miniature power stations, generating electricity whenever you switch on the central heating or hot water. It won't make electricity meters run backwards. But for an estimated \u00a3500 extra on the price of a new boiler, the machine will generate electricity for the home for nothing, using excess heat that would otherwise escape out the flue. In Britain, a confidential report prepared for electricity companies by energy consultants EA Technology estimates that by 2025, 13m of the country's 23m households could have their own little power station humming away in the boiler cupboard. The Stirling engine was patented in 1816 by a Scottish clergyman, Robert Stirling. It consists of two cylinders, filled with gas, each containing a piston. The cylinders are heated and cooled in turn, making the pistons move up and down to turn a drive shaft. In existing domestic gas boilers, about a third of the heat is wasted. With the latest make of Stirling engine fitted, that spare heat is used to drive a small generator. The idea of turning homes into power stations is known as \"micro chp\" (combined heat and power). EA Technology is championing a Stirling engine made by WhisperTech, a New Zealand company, which can generate a kilowatt of electricity - enough to power three fridges. British Gas is working on a different design with a similar power output, based on an engine from the US firm SunPower. \"We have now got to the stage where we've overcome the technical barriers, and it's simply a matter of product development, things like designing the right colour for the casing,\" said EA Technology's Jeremy Harrison. He said the first units would be on sale in 2002. Depending on the size of the home, he said, they would save householders between \u00a3150 and \u00a3300 a year on their electricity bills. The beauty of micro chp is that it cuts in when demand on the grid from households is greatest. On a summer's afternoon, with the fridge on and the TV and VCR on standby, a household might be using only a few hundred watts of electricity. On a winter's evening, with kettles, electric cookers, irons, washing machines and tumble dryers working, that might rise to 20 kilowatts. But with the central heating and hot water on, the home would be generating its own electricity, lightening the load on the grid, the family budget, and the environment. EA Technology estimates that at peak times, a network of 13m households would generate 15,000 to 23,000 megawatts of electricity, compared with 15,000 megawatts produced by the country's nuclear power stations. However, if the government wanted to promote micro chp specifically as a way of cutting down on the carbon dioxide emissions held responsible for global warming, it would need to close high-emitting coal-fired power stations, rather than nuclear ones. The government has been keen to promote chp as a means of implementing the 1997 Kyoto protocols, which called for reductions in carbon emissions.",

      "bodyText": "An illegal immigrant was seriously injured yesterday and two others suffered broken legs after smuggling themselves on to a freight train through the Channel tunnel. Eurostar has launched an inquiry into the incident after police found 13 men near the tracks at the Folkestone tunnel entrance. One of the victims underwent emergency treatment in hospital after suffering serious head injuries. The men - all believed to be from Bangladesh - are thought to have boarded a UK-bound freight train in Belgium and jumped off as it emerged in England. The train travels through the tunnel at speeds of 60-90 mph. Eurostar was forced to suspend train services between London and Paris for two and a half hours while police searched the area for more suspects. Kent police said officers were called to the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone at 8.30am after 10 men were seen at the freight train checking-in area, Dollands Moor, near the tunnel entrance in Kent. The group was found after a search of the tunnel site. The 10, who were not injured, were taken to the immigration screening service in Dover. Shortly afterwards, a further two men from the same group were found lying in agony on the ground where they had fallen from a 12ft fence as they tried to escape. They were taken to William Harvey hospital in Ashford. At 9am officers found a 13th man lying unconscious in a pool of blood on the railway line close to the tunnel, with serious head injuries. Police said he had fallen from the train as the others had jumped off and had hit his head on the tracks. It is thought the other immigrants had left him on his own as they tried to escape. Last night he was being treated in intensive care at the William Harvey hospital. Jane Walker, a spokeswoman for Kent holice, said: \"It appears [the immigrants] tried to get off the freight train as it was coming from France but they did not get off actually in the tunnel. \"One man was found near the main line with serious head injuries. Two others appeared to have been injured. They will all be handed over to immigration officials. \"Our only involvement after this will be to see if a crime has been committed to the man who was found seriously injured.\" Shuttle services resumed at 10am and passenger services restarted at 11.20am but there continued to be delays due to a backlog of trains. The incident has raised fears that the recent crackdown in Calais to stop refugees getting on to the back of lorries bound for Britain is forcing illegal immigrants on to the trains. A spokesman for the Freight Transport Association, Geoff Dossetter, said: \"Truck drivers and operators are trying to do all they can to stop illegal immigrants getting into Britain. \"Since Calais has clamped down there have been growing fears that asylum seekers will use the freight trains as a means of getting into the country.\" An immigration service spokesman said last night that none of the 13 men had formally claimed asylum. Bill Dix, Eurotunnel's deputy managing director, said the company was reviewing the train's route to establish exactly how the men got on. \"No transport system in the world is 100% able to ensure illegal travellers don't board,\" he said. He said security on the trains was primarily the responsibility of the French and Belgian authorities and was not Eurotunnel's role.",

      "body": "<p>The government has no plans to implement legislation for no-fault divorce in England and Wales which was passed by parliament in 1996, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, will resist pressure from his advisory board on family law to bring into force part two of the Family Law Act 1996 and end the use of the fault-based grounds of adultery and unreasonable behaviour, which now account for more than two in three divorces.</p> <p>The board told Lord Irvine in its annual report that it was surprised and disappointed when he announced in June 1999 that the reforms would not be brought into force this year, and that no decision would be taken until after the final results of a pilot study of compulsory \"information meetings\" for those contemplating divorce.</p> <p>Lord Irvine has received the results in a report from Professor Janet Walker of Newcastle university but he has no intention of implementing no-fault divorce legislation.</p> <p>His stance will be a blow to the advisory board, which has described the current law as widely discredited and the issue of fault as a \"central, corrosive element\" in it.</p> <p>The government is not opposed to no-fault divorce but has no great attachment to the act, pushed through by the last government in the face of substantial opposition by \"moral majority\" peers and MPs. Substantial amendments made the divorce process longer and more complicated than originally planned and the resulting compromise has been described as a \"dog's breakfast\", by a leading divorce researcher, Professor Gwynn Davis of Bristol university.</p> <p>Even the advisory board concedes that a backlash could be provoked by the length of time a divorce would take under the planned law - up to 21 months for couples with children, compared to three or four months for a \"quickie\" divorce under the current law.</p> <p>Ministers are reluctant to categorically rule out implementation because the reform was passed by parliament. Under the reforms a divorce would be granted at the request of one party without the need to prove fault, after a period for \"reflection and consideration\". But the couple would have to reach a financial settlement and resolve issues over any children before the divorce could be finalised.</p> <p>While most family lawyers favour no-fault divorce in principle, many feel the act is too complicated, drawing out an already painful process. The government could introduce a bill of its own but has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future, because it would inevitably meet the same opposition in the House of Lords.</p> <p>Nor will it go ahead with compulsory information meetings, which were part of the no-fault process laid down by the act. These have been extensively (and expensively) piloted at a cost of \u00a31m for the research alone.</p> <p>The meetings were intended to inform people about the issues they would need to tackle and the services available for resolving difficulties. But the information was delivered in a standardised form while the research found that people wanted information geared to their circumstances.</p> <p>A key aim of the act was to save public money by diverting people wanting legal aid for their divorce battles away from expensive lawyers and into cheaper mediation services. Provisions to encourage divorcing couples to use mediation are in a separate part of the act already in force.</p> <p>Ministers hoped a rule requiring those applying for legal aid for a divorce battle to undergo assessment, to see if their cases were suitable for mediation, would produce a big saving. But mediation needs co-operation by the other spouse, and research by Prof Davis, which went to the lord chancellor last month, found that few couples actually went through the process.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has no plans to implement legislation for no-fault divorce in England and Wales which was passed by parliament in 1996, the Guardian has learned. The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, will resist pressure from his advisory board on family law to bring into force part two of the Family Law Act 1996 and end the use of the fault-based grounds of adultery and unreasonable behaviour, which now account for more than two in three divorces. The board told Lord Irvine in its annual report that it was surprised and disappointed when he announced in June 1999 that the reforms would not be brought into force this year, and that no decision would be taken until after the final results of a pilot study of compulsory \"information meetings\" for those contemplating divorce. Lord Irvine has received the results in a report from Professor Janet Walker of Newcastle university but he has no intention of implementing no-fault divorce legislation. His stance will be a blow to the advisory board, which has described the current law as widely discredited and the issue of fault as a \"central, corrosive element\" in it. The government is not opposed to no-fault divorce but has no great attachment to the act, pushed through by the last government in the face of substantial opposition by \"moral majority\" peers and MPs. Substantial amendments made the divorce process longer and more complicated than originally planned and the resulting compromise has been described as a \"dog's breakfast\", by a leading divorce researcher, Professor Gwynn Davis of Bristol university. Even the advisory board concedes that a backlash could be provoked by the length of time a divorce would take under the planned law - up to 21 months for couples with children, compared to three or four months for a \"quickie\" divorce under the current law. Ministers are reluctant to categorically rule out implementation because the reform was passed by parliament. Under the reforms a divorce would be granted at the request of one party without the need to prove fault, after a period for \"reflection and consideration\". But the couple would have to reach a financial settlement and resolve issues over any children before the divorce could be finalised. While most family lawyers favour no-fault divorce in principle, many feel the act is too complicated, drawing out an already painful process. The government could introduce a bill of its own but has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future, because it would inevitably meet the same opposition in the House of Lords. Nor will it go ahead with compulsory information meetings, which were part of the no-fault process laid down by the act. These have been extensively (and expensively) piloted at a cost of \u00a31m for the research alone. The meetings were intended to inform people about the issues they would need to tackle and the services available for resolving difficulties. But the information was delivered in a standardised form while the research found that people wanted information geared to their circumstances. A key aim of the act was to save public money by diverting people wanting legal aid for their divorce battles away from expensive lawyers and into cheaper mediation services. Provisions to encourage divorcing couples to use mediation are in a separate part of the act already in force. Ministers hoped a rule requiring those applying for legal aid for a divorce battle to undergo assessment, to see if their cases were suitable for mediation, would produce a big saving. But mediation needs co-operation by the other spouse, and research by Prof Davis, which went to the lord chancellor last month, found that few couples actually went through the process.",

Talks continued yesterday between the commander of the Royal Irish Regiment contingent in Sierra Leone, Colonel Simon Fordham, and the West Side Boys, led by a Brigadier-General Foday Kallay. Lt Cdr Cramp said negotiators had also had brief radio contact with the hostages who said they were fit and well. Five of the soldiers were released on Wednesday night after British negotiators gave the West Side Boys a satellite phone. Some of the West Side Boys' relatives met the captors yesterday to try to persuade them to free the other hostages. One mother, Juliet Sesay, said they appealed to their sons by saying the British were in Sierra Leone to help the country. She said the West Side Boys responded that they had nothing against the British but that the abductions had finally brought attention to their demands. However, Sierra Leone's information minister, Julius Spencer, yesterday ruled out any concessions to the hostage takers, whose demands range from the release of comrades to a new government.",

      "bodyText": "The senior Indonesian generals thought to be responsible for masterminding last year's orgy of violence in East Timor are likely to escape prosecution after their names were omitted from a provisional list of 19 suspects issued by government investigators yesterday. The investigator, Muhammad Abdul Rachman, said that the fact that the list did not name General Wiranto, who was armed forces commander last year, General Faisal Tanjung, the then security minister, and Major General Zacky Anwar, the intelligence chief for East Timor, \"did not close the possibility that they could be named later\". However, his tone suggested that neither they nor senior militia commanders, who carried out much of the killing but were also not on the list, would ever become suspects. The campaign of army-backed militia violence in East Timor led to the murder of more than 1,000 people. The East Timorese leader Jose Ramos Horta said it was \"absolutely unacceptable\" and that the United Nations now had no option but to insist on an international war crimes tribunal along the lines of those convened for Bosnia and Rwanda. The UN has thus far refused to establish a tribunal because officials say Indonesia should first be given the opportunity to bring those responsible to justice. Those named yesterday included three low-ranking generals.The former civilian governor of East Timor, Abilio Soares, was also declared a provisional suspect, as were a handful of army colonels and a couple of junior militia commanders. The government investigation examined five specific incidents: the death of the Financial Times journalist Sander Thoenes, the massacres at churches in the towns of Liquica and Suai, and the attack on the homes of the Nobel peace laureate Bishop Carlos Belo and the prominent pro-independence campaigner Manuel Carascalao. Mr Rachman said questioning would begin next week but could give no date for when trials might begin. Indonesia's parliament has yet to pass the legislation which will create ad hoc human rights courts - required under Indonesian law to try the suspects. In January a team from Indonesia's human rights commission completed an initial investigation into the atrocities for the government.

Hushed tones and respectful silences may be the usual mode of behaviour, but Ian Hussein, director of the city's cemeteries, can barely contain his frustration. A suspicion he has been harbouring for years is rapidly becoming a crisis, but he believes few in power are listening to his warning: we are running out of space to bury the dead. As inner London boroughs face filling their cemeteries completely in seven years on average, meetings next week are expected to call for urgent action to address the crisis and accuse the government of having reneged on proposals to legalise the only realistic solution. At a public debate organised by the Museum of London, and an international conference at Goldsmith's College, academics and professionals will argue that it is time to break one of the last taboos - and begin to reuse existing graves. \"There is a consensus in the profession that reuse is the only way we are going to make cemeteries sustainable,\" said Mr Hussein, who is chairing the debate, organised as part of Grave Concerns, a two month exhibition on the disposal of London's dead, which opened at the museum yesterday. \"But I firmly believe one or more senior politicians have stamped on this initiative because they see no votes in it.\" Julie Rugg, of York University's cemetery research group, agreed: \"We need to know why the government is not saying anything.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush's presidential campaign turned negative yesterday, when the jittery Republican candidate for the White House launched the first personal \"attack ad\" of the 2000 contest against his Democratic rival, Al Gore. Mr Bush has authorised the airing of an election commercial this weekend which mocks Mr Gore's character and credibility, accusing him of reinventing himself, using video footage of a controversial fund-raising visit to a Buddhist temple four years ago, and deriding his claim that he helped to create the internet. The launch of the ad, which refers viewers to a new and not yet operational website titled gorewillsayanything.com, triggered a series of sharp and not wholly credible exchanges between the two camps. The Bush campaign tried to play down the obviously critical ad as \"tongue-in-cheek\", while the Gore campaign let fly with righteous indignation and crocodile tears over the depths to which its opponents have suddenly sunk. The new Bush ad was \"a humorous way of making an important point,\" said Mr Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes. \"There is a gaping gap between what Vice-President Gore says and what Vice-President Gore does.\" But Mr Gore's running mate, Joe Lieberman, countered: \"I'm sorry to say that Governor Bush's promise to change the tone of American politics has run into the realities of a troubled Bush-Cheney campaign. \"These new attack ads break his promise not to launch personal attacks in the campaign and they drag us back to the worst politics of the past.

Eager to protect its latest tactical advantage, the Gore campaign promptly put a hold on plans to launch a sharply critical commercial attacking Mr Bush's record as governor of Texas. In contrast to his decision a week ago to stop the airing of an attack ad against Mr Gore, Mr Bush personally authorised the release of the new election commercial on Wednesday. It was due to begin running last night in 17 states. It shows a television set on a kitchen counter with Mr Gore on the screen. An unseen woman's voice complains that Mr Gore is \"reinventing himself on television again\". As the commercial shows the clips of Mr Gore visiting the Buddhist temple and telling an interviewer: \"I took the initiative in creating the internet,\" the woman says: \"Yeah, and I invented the remote control.\" \"Surely it's fair game for us to point out his fundamental hypocrisy on his number one issue,\" Cliff May, a Republican National Committee spokesman, said. The Democrats were content \"to watch the Republicans shoot themselves in the foot\", according to the party spokeswoman Jenny Backus. The launch of the ad comes at the end of two bad weeks for Mr Bush in his struggle against Mr Gore. After months in the lead, polls indicate that, at worst, Mr Gore is back on level terms with Mr Bush following his appearance at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last month. Although most American political observers tend to be sceptical of any election opinion polling before this weekend's traditional Labour Day holiday, the new closeness in the presidential race has provoked disagreement within the Bush camp about how best to campaign against Mr Gore. The launch of the new ad has been widely seen as a sign of Bush nervousness, but one which could pay dividends. \"This is a political version of investing in junk bonds,\" Stu Rothenberg, a campaign analyst, said. \"A dramatic and risky move which has the potential for a significant return.\"",

      "bodyText": "An English mother was yesterday ordered by two judges to send her two children to a French-speaking school because her estranged husband wants them to keep their cultural background. The 35-year-old, who is seeking a divorce from the 42-year-old French father, wants her two children - a boy aged six and a girl of eight - to have an English education. But the father says that because the children live with the mother, they will lose their French cultural background if they are educated at a English-speaking school. Both children, who cannot be identified by order of the court, were born in England and speak \"reasonable but not fluent French\", according to the mother's evidence. They are now attending small private schools but both will move next week to a day school in London where lessons are held in French only. Bruce Blair QC, representing the mother at the court of appeal yesterday, said that the father had said his wife could not be relied upon to promote a bilingual and bicultural background for the children. Mr Blair said the mother spoke fluent French, had a French boyfriend, and took her holidays in France with the children, who were constantly exposed to the culture and language. Lord Justice Robert Walker, giving the court's judgment yesterday, said he could not alter the ruling of a high court judge, David Gee, that \"the best opportunity for the future of these children is for them to have the opportunity of going\" to the French-speaking school. Lord Justice Walker, sitting with Lord Justice Simon Brown, said both parents were \"well educated and prosperous\". They married in 1990 and set up home in south-west London, where the two children were born. The judge said that the father worked for a Japanese bank in London and the stresses of his job contributed to the marital breakdown. After a failed attempt at reconciliation which would have involved the family moving to France, the mother filed for divorce a second time in January. The mother, who will be applying for maintenance when the divorce is completed, intends to stay in London but the father, who was made redundant last year, may return to France, said the judge. The girl's headmistress, in a plea to the court not to send the eight-year-old to the 2,500-pupil French-speaking school, said she was happy in her small class and put up a confident front \"to hide the unsettled life she is leading at the moment\". Lord Justice Walker said the father maintained that his children had a bilingual and bicultural background and he wanted that to continue although they would be brought up in England. The judge said that the mother wanted her children to have an English education and objected to the French-speaking school because of its size, the fact its lessons were taught in French, which would make it difficult for her to help them with their homework, and the disruption the move would cause to them. Lord Justice Walker said Judge Gee had found that the French school would be the best solution to achieve a balance of Englishness and Frenchness for the children. Lord Justice Walker said Judge Gee had a \"difficult decision\" to make and decisions often involved uncertainty but there was no reason to change his ruling. He dismissed the mother's appeal and ordered her to pay the costs of the hearing. The father, who was in court, declined to comment. The mother is in France on holiday with her children.

Unless a serious rethink is given to the whole UN operation in Sierra Leone before the prime minister and his colleagues sit down to the table, the meeting will be hollow and the menu nothing but fudge.</p> <p>The framework for strong action is clear enough. Ten months ago the UN sent a peace force to Sierra Leone to support the government in its war with the so-called Revolutionary United Front. Sierra Leone was a stereotypical case of a weak state with an ineffective government trying to pick up the pieces left by an earlier corrupt ruler. There was an argument for the outside world to do nothing, but after the interventions in Kosovo and East Timor, and the UN's failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda, those who advocated a UN role in Sierra Leone were right. Africa could not just be abandoned. The initial UN operation did not work well and in May some 500 of its troops were seized by the RUF. It was at that point that Britain acceded to an urgent request by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, for help. Britain intervened with around a thousand troops, though strictly on a unilateral mandate and without putting them under UN control. The intervention worked, at least temporarily, and when Britain withdrew most of its troops, they were replaced by a larger UN presence, mainly consisting of Nigerian, Jordanian, and Indian troops. Mr Annan now wants to increase the force from its present 13,000 men to just over 20,000.</p> <p>The crisis over the British troops seized by the gang known as the West Side Boys has shown that the solution to Sierra Leone's problems is not purely one of quantity. The existing UN force is lax and inefficient and has allowed undisciplined village volunteers to become licensed bandits, setting up roadblocks and terrorising civilians virtually unchecked. The Sierra Leone army which was to be trained by the British remains unimpressive. Adding more UN troops will not necessarily change the situation unless the whole style and nature of the UN operation is made more professional. This is where Britain has a role to play. If negotiations with the West Side Boys fail, there may well be a temptation for Britain to send in the military equivalent of a snatch squad, a helicopter-borne SAS team, to try to rescue the six errant British servicemen. The government seems to fear that tabloid pressure to \"save our boys\" could mount if the hostage drama goes on. But the fate of the six soldiers is not the main issue. Whether a military swoop rescues the hostages or not, the bigger question is how to rescue the UN operation in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>One way for that to be done is for Britain to reverse the decision it took last May to confine its intervention to training. It ought to go back into Sierra Leone in a major way with a substantial presence that is under a new combined UN command. No other permanent member of the security council is likely to want to get involved. The United States is in embroiled in elections. France has no stomach for involvement in former British colonies. Russia and China have no interest in sending troops. Britain took the initial decision to intervene in May, knowing that it could lead to a wider involvement. For better or worse that moment has come.</p>",

The crisis over the British troops seized by the gang known as the West Side Boys has shown that the solution to Sierra Leone's problems is not purely one of quantity. The existing UN force is lax and inefficient and has allowed undisciplined village volunteers to become licensed bandits, setting up roadblocks and terrorising civilians virtually unchecked. The Sierra Leone army which was to be trained by the British remains unimpressive. Adding more UN troops will not necessarily change the situation unless the whole style and nature of the UN operation is made more professional. This is where Britain has a role to play. If negotiations with the West Side Boys fail, there may well be a temptation for Britain to send in the military equivalent of a snatch squad, a helicopter-borne SAS team, to try to rescue the six errant British servicemen. The government seems to fear that tabloid pressure to \"save our boys\" could mount if the hostage drama goes on. But the fate of the six soldiers is not the main issue. Whether a military swoop rescues the hostages or not, the bigger question is how to rescue the UN operation in Sierra Leone. One way for that to be done is for Britain to reverse the decision it took last May to confine its intervention to training. It ought to go back into Sierra Leone in a major way with a substantial presence that is under a new combined UN command. No other permanent member of the security council is likely to want to get involved. The United States is in embroiled in elections. France has no stomach for involvement in former British colonies. Russia and China have no interest in sending troops. Britain took the initial decision to intervene in May, knowing that it could lead to a wider involvement. For better or worse that moment has come.",

About 70 people gathered in the City of London for the protest. A police spokeswoman said that there was one arrest after a police officer was assaulted. Yesterday George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Kelvin, who has led the campaign in parliament on the case and has called for a public inquiry into the CPS's handling of workplace deaths, said the DPP's continuing failure to prosecute was inexplicable. Mr Jones's mother, Anne Jones, said she found it incredible. Mr Jones, 24, was killed and his head partly severed by a crane grab while he was unloading cobblestones from a Polish ship for a Dutch-owned firm, Euromin, within two hours of starting work on April 24, 1998. Euromin and its general manager, James Martell, were found by inspectors to have been breaking health and safety regulations. But despite pressure for action, the CPS twice refused to prosecute either Mr Martell or Euromin for manslaughter on grounds of insufficient evidence. The case has become a focus for those campaigning against casualisation and for tougher legal action against negligent and reckless employers. Yesterday, protesters celebrated Mr Jones's birthday - he would have been 27 - in the streets of the City of London. The government is consulting on a new offence of corporate killing, which would make it easier to prosecute and heavily fine firms for gross negligence. Under current legislation, it is necessary to prove the culpability of a manager for a charge of corporate manslaughter to stick. But campaigners believe that the CPS and DPP are reluctant to prosecute firms for corporate manslaughter, even where there is a realistic chance of a conviction, because they are unhappy about the consequences of company directors being sent to prison over deaths at work. Mrs Jones said yesterday: \"I find it absolutely incredible that after a judgment such as that given in March and after they have already had two years to consider the evidence, they need a further five months.\" Mr Galloway said: \"It is inexplicable that Mr Calvert-Smith would make the high court justices who demanded expedition look so foolish, and so one is left to speculate that the real reason is the possibility that a successful prosecution will see more employers guilty of gross workplace negligence in the dock on charges of manslaughter.\"",

      "body": "<p>This week the Home Office launched its first-ever nationwide recruitment campaign for the police force. The aim is to attract 9,000 extra recruits in England and Wales over the next three years to stem an alarming downward trend.</p> <p>Last March there were 124,418 officers in the 43 police forces, more than 2,400 fewer than in 1997. According to a Home Office spokesman the campaign aims \"to raise the status of the police in the eyes of the public, and within the force itself\".</p> <p>It's a tall order, but nowhere more so than in terms of attracting recruits from black and Asian backgrounds. Responding to the recommendations of the Macpherson report, in August 1999 the Home Office set 10-year recruitment targets for individual forces pegged to the ethnic identity of the population.</p> <p>By 2010 the force aims to recruit 7% black and Asian officers, an average of 826 officers annually.</p> <p>But progress has been slow: the latest Home Office figures show that, in the past year, numbers of ethnic minority officers have risen to 2,756, just 209 more than in 1999.</p> <p>Although the number of recruits has increased by 8% since 1999; ethnic minority officers still comprise just 2% of the total force.</p> <p>On one level, forces are trying hard. Greater Manchester Police, for example, listens to the recommendations of a policy advisory group which includes representatives from the black and Asian community \"who can act as champions for us\".</p> <p>They now produce preparation packs to help officers negotiate the Initial Recruitment Test which, for reasons they say they can't identify, is failed by a disproportionate number of minority ethnic officers.</p> <p>Similar initiatives at the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) include sending volunteers into schools and careers fairs to challenge stereotypes of a straight, white male culture. The MPA has also started to place advertisements in journals such as Asian Eye and The Voice.</p> <p>But recruiting more officers will be a waste of time until the culture within the force undergoes a sea-change.

      "bodyText": "This week the Home Office launched its first-ever nationwide recruitment campaign for the police force. The aim is to attract 9,000 extra recruits in England and Wales over the next three years to stem an alarming downward trend. Last March there were 124,418 officers in the 43 police forces, more than 2,400 fewer than in 1997. According to a Home Office spokesman the campaign aims \"to raise the status of the police in the eyes of the public, and within the force itself\". It's a tall order, but nowhere more so than in terms of attracting recruits from black and Asian backgrounds. Responding to the recommendations of the Macpherson report, in August 1999 the Home Office set 10-year recruitment targets for individual forces pegged to the ethnic identity of the population. By 2010 the force aims to recruit 7% black and Asian officers, an average of 826 officers annually. But progress has been slow: the latest Home Office figures show that, in the past year, numbers of ethnic minority officers have risen to 2,756, just 209 more than in 1999. Although the number of recruits has increased by 8% since 1999; ethnic minority officers still comprise just 2% of the total force. On one level, forces are trying hard. Greater Manchester Police, for example, listens to the recommendations of a policy advisory group which includes representatives from the black and Asian community \"who can act as champions for us\". They now produce preparation packs to help officers negotiate the Initial Recruitment Test which, for reasons they say they can't identify, is failed by a disproportionate number of minority ethnic officers. Similar initiatives at the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) include sending volunteers into schools and careers fairs to challenge stereotypes of a straight, white male culture. The MPA has also started to place advertisements in journals such as Asian Eye and The Voice. But recruiting more officers will be a waste of time until the culture within the force undergoes a sea-change. In the week that this story was researched two newspaper stories - the race discrimination suffered by Gurpal Virdi and the death in custody of a black soldier - made headline news. No surprise then, that Denise Blake, manager of Interface, a Manchester-based mentoring programme for black and Asian students, comments: \"Sadly there is a very, very negative perception of the police.

A husband who was working too hard and rarely present. How did I feel at the end of each day - pleased that I had managed to get through intact? No: there was hardly a moment of the day when an inner voice wasn't highlighting my failings.</p> <p>The work wasn't good enough because I couldn't give it the time it needed. My child was being permanently damaged by my neglect. I didn't have the energy to listen to my husband's concerns. My day was being polluted by \"toxic worry\" - an insidious syndrome which manages to take away enjoyment from life. It prevented me seeing that clients were not complaining, the carer provided different sorts of fun and a work-weary partner doesn't necessarily want to talk about work.</p> <p>My failure, and that of many other women trying to work a first shift at work and a second shift at home, is that we have yet to learn how to live with the third shift. The third shift is that psychological space available for thoughts about the lives we are creating. For Michele Kremer Bolton, learning to manage the third shift so that women can live in greater comfort with their choices is the challenge of the next phase of feminism.</p> <p>Ms Bolton observed that her female business students rejected options open to them not because of lack of skill but because of an inner glass ceiling built on self-doubt which placed limits on the risks and possibilities they could see for themselves. Disappointed by the power of the inner ceiling on a highly privileged group, she carried out research with women across a diversity of employment areas, socio-economic groups, age ranges and racial identities and discovered three challenges which impacted on them all.</p> <p>The identity challenge: being able to express themselves as they really were versus trying to be what others will accept. The task challenge: getting the job done versus worrying about how everyone feels. The balance challenge: spending time on themselves versus giving time to others.</p> <p>Common to all was the focus on relationships. If a women reveals herself as she really is, she may lose the approval which comes with going along with others' expectations. If a woman focuses on the task in hand she may be seen as unconcerned for others.</p> <p>The same dilemmas exist for men, but the distinction Ms Bolton makes is that, within corporate life, successful men have often attained a subconscious \"disconnect\" which allows the dilemmas to exist without creating personal strain, or have developed means of managing that third shift which few women have accessed.</p> <p>Managing the third shift, so that concerns can be put in their place of relative importance, requires the ability to create space for the voice of self-awareness alongside the voice of self-punishment. Creating a mental box which recognises those things which are within and outside our control in relation to both people and tasks immediately puts into awareness ideas which are denied.</p> <p>If I had created that box during my week of despair, I would have recognised how I did have control over my work, the impossibility of my controlling my husband's workload, and my son's ability to control my guilt.</p> <p>I might even have patted myself on the back for getting through it all and made time to go to the gym.</p> <p>\u0095 Carole Pemberton is managing consultant at Career Matters.

A husband who was working too hard and rarely present. How did I feel at the end of each day - pleased that I had managed to get through intact? No: there was hardly a moment of the day when an inner voice wasn't highlighting my failings. The work wasn't good enough because I couldn't give it the time it needed. My child was being permanently damaged by my neglect. I didn't have the energy to listen to my husband's concerns. My day was being polluted by \"toxic worry\" - an insidious syndrome which manages to take away enjoyment from life. It prevented me seeing that clients were not complaining, the carer provided different sorts of fun and a work-weary partner doesn't necessarily want to talk about work. My failure, and that of many other women trying to work a first shift at work and a second shift at home, is that we have yet to learn how to live with the third shift. The third shift is that psychological space available for thoughts about the lives we are creating. For Michele Kremer Bolton, learning to manage the third shift so that women can live in greater comfort with their choices is the challenge of the next phase of feminism. Ms Bolton observed that her female business students rejected options open to them not because of lack of skill but because of an inner glass ceiling built on self-doubt which placed limits on the risks and possibilities they could see for themselves. Disappointed by the power of the inner ceiling on a highly privileged group, she carried out research with women across a diversity of employment areas, socio-economic groups, age ranges and racial identities and discovered three challenges which impacted on them all. The identity challenge: being able to express themselves as they really were versus trying to be what others will accept. The task challenge: getting the job done versus worrying about how everyone feels. The balance challenge: spending time on themselves versus giving time to others. Common to all was the focus on relationships. If a women reveals herself as she really is, she may lose the approval which comes with going along with others' expectations. If a woman focuses on the task in hand she may be seen as unconcerned for others. The same dilemmas exist for men, but the distinction Ms Bolton makes is that, within corporate life, successful men have often attained a subconscious \"disconnect\" which allows the dilemmas to exist without creating personal strain, or have developed means of managing that third shift which few women have accessed. Managing the third shift, so that concerns can be put in their place of relative importance, requires the ability to create space for the voice of self-awareness alongside the voice of self-punishment. Creating a mental box which recognises those things which are within and outside our control in relation to both people and tasks immediately puts into awareness ideas which are denied. If I had created that box during my week of despair, I would have recognised how I did have control over my work, the impossibility of my controlling my husband's workload, and my son's ability to control my guilt. I might even have patted myself on the back for getting through it all and made time to go to the gym. \u0095 Carole Pemberton is managing consultant at Career Matters.

The authorities accept that there there is little they can do about the two dozen well-established villages on the perimeter which have legal titles to the land, so they are concentrating on the more recent settlers. \"The biggest risk is fragmentation,\" Mr Perez said. Although the irregular communities are small and dispersed, they threaten to break up the unity of the ecosystem. The danger is greatest in the dry season, when the settlers burn off the vegetation in preparation for planting, posing the threat of uncontrollable fires. \"The most logical thing to do would be to send in the security forces to evict the irregular communities, but that simply is too politically delicate a thing to do, because of the Zapatistas.\" he said. \"Realistically, a long-term solution to the problem will not be possible until that conflict is resolved.\" \"We didn't want to move from that blessed land, where things grow on their own,\" Enrique Perez said, standing in front of his new concrete house and surveying the five hectares he has been given in a heavily farmed area 50 miles west of Montes Azules. \"Sure, there is the road, but what good is the road when we have nothing to sell? I am thinking of going back.\" Those who have yet to move are also reconsidering their decision to go, in the light of the recent presidential and state governorship elections victories by candidates committed to peace talks with the Zapatistas. The word spreading through the jungle is that the new authorities will be anxious to defuse the tension that the relocation drive has created around the rebels' safe havens.",

Most of Miyake-jima's 3,800 residents have already left the island, 125 miles south of Tokyo. Over the next three days the remaining 900 will be ferried to the mainland, where they will be given food and accommodation. The evacuation order came after experts from the meteorological agency said Mount Oyama, at the centre of the island, was in danger of unleashing huge pyroclastic flows - very fast-flowing frothy lava. Residents on the island have suffered a summer of disruption, with a series of powerful earthquakes and minor eruptions followed on August 18 by Mount Oyama's biggest eruption since 1983. Last week, more than 130 children and their teachers were evacuated after another large eruption. Although they are unable to predict the timing of an eruption, the experts were concerned by evidence that rising magma was coming into contact with underground water, a process that has potentially catastrophic consequences. Shintaro Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo, said the island faced \" a danger greater than anything we have experienced so far\". About 600 officials and emergency workers will remain on the island during the daytime to monitor volcanic activity and check gas and water supplies.

      "bodyText": "First you serialise the gross inaccuracies of Norman Finkelstein's The Holocaust Industry and now you publish the astonishing revisionism of Tim Luckhurst (The plucky Swiss, September 1). He writes that Switzerland \"did not persecute or deport Jews\". Yet under Dr Heinrich Rothmund, director of police, practically every Jew illegally entering Switzerland during 1939-44 was pushed back across the border, arrested by the waiting Gestapo and dispatched to their deaths. In 1942, only 9,150 foreign Jews lived in Switzerland, just 980 more than in 1931. Rudolph Kastner's negotiations to save some Hungarian Jews were in 1944 - after the government reversed its policies. By then, tens of thousands of Jews had been expelled and murdered. The Swiss kept their money. Tom Bower London",

The move is part of Standard Chartered's aim to extend in emerging markets. The acquisition of the Chase business is just a few million pounds short of the $1.34bn Standard Chartered paid for Grindlays Bank, which boosted its presence in other emerging markets - particularly India. Rana Talwar, the chief executive of Standard Chartered, described the acquisition as a perfect fit. \"Hong Kong consumer banking is our most important market. This move adds to our existing strength and builds our consumer franchise.\" The bank's shares ended 9p higher at 963p, despite the placement by UBS Warburg and Cazenove at 915p. Lloyds TSB's shares fell 20p to 628p, although analysts said that was unrelated to acquisition of the leasing business and more a sign of a gentle move out of banking stocks. John Davies, managing director of Lloyds TSB's asset finance division, said the acquisition would allow the bank to consolidate its position as the leader in motor finance.",

Pok\u00e9mon, short for pocket monster, started out as a game for Nintendo's Game Boy.

He told wholesalers that while they might make a loss on the games machines, they would more than recoup it through sales of the games' cartridges.

      "body": "<p>Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers faces a crucial meeting with the main clearing banks later this month over the Post Office proposal for a universal bank. </p> <p>He will be under pressure from his own backbench MPs to persuade the banks to back the scheme because failure could lead to the closure of almost half of the post offices in their constituencies. </p> <p>The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters said that without the Post Office-run universal bank up to 8,000 post offices - nearly half the network - would no longer be viable. So far the banks have opposed the idea because they would have to subsidise it. </p> <p>The PO submitted its final business plan for the new bank to the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday. </p> <p>Post office closures, running at about two a day, are forecast to accelerate rapidly over the next year unless the banks and the government agree to fund the universal bank, which is to be given a new name to prevent it being dubbed the poor people's bank. </p> <p>The new bank, which would offer a very basic account without overdraft facilities, is an important part of the government and PO strategy to replace the \u00a3400m that branches will lose when benefit payments start being paid direct to bank accounts in 2003. </p> <p>On average there are 30 post offices in each constituency. If the 8,000 post offices at risk were to close, the constituency number would be halved. Government plans to privatise the PO or reduce its 16,500-branch network have met with public opposition in the past. </p> <p>The preservation of the branch network is seen as crucial at a time when the big banks have been closing branches in rural areas. </p> <p>Already a number of banks, including Lloyds TSB, the Co-op, Barclays and Alliance and Leicester, have arranged for post office branches to provide basic banking services for their customers. </p> <p>The government wants the estimated 3m people without bank accounts to be drawn into the banking system so it can go ahead with its plan for direct payment of benefits. </p> <p>The Treasury would like the banks to introduce their own no-frills accounts, whereas the DTI would prefer the universal bank - not least because it might halt the attrition of the post office network. </p> <p>The plan for banks to install cash machines in 3,000 post offices over the next 18 months appears to have been shelved - even though it was welcomed by the government when announced in February. </p> <p>The banks, which would have to pay the \u00a350,000 installation cost for each machine, have gone cold on the idea since they were forced to drop plans for charging customers using them. Only about a dozen machines have been installed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers faces a crucial meeting with the main clearing banks later this month over the Post Office proposal for a universal bank. He will be under pressure from his own backbench MPs to persuade the banks to back the scheme because failure could lead to the closure of almost half of the post offices in their constituencies. The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters said that without the Post Office-run universal bank up to 8,000 post offices - nearly half the network - would no longer be viable. So far the banks have opposed the idea because they would have to subsidise it. The PO submitted its final business plan for the new bank to the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday. Post office closures, running at about two a day, are forecast to accelerate rapidly over the next year unless the banks and the government agree to fund the universal bank, which is to be given a new name to prevent it being dubbed the poor people's bank. The new bank, which would offer a very basic account without overdraft facilities, is an important part of the government and PO strategy to replace the \u00a3400m that branches will lose when benefit payments start being paid direct to bank accounts in 2003. On average there are 30 post offices in each constituency. If the 8,000 post offices at risk were to close, the constituency number would be halved. Government plans to privatise the PO or reduce its 16,500-branch network have met with public opposition in the past. The preservation of the branch network is seen as crucial at a time when the big banks have been closing branches in rural areas. Already a number of banks, including Lloyds TSB, the Co-op, Barclays and Alliance and Leicester, have arranged for post office branches to provide basic banking services for their customers. The government wants the estimated 3m people without bank accounts to be drawn into the banking system so it can go ahead with its plan for direct payment of benefits. The Treasury would like the banks to introduce their own no-frills accounts, whereas the DTI would prefer the universal bank - not least because it might halt the attrition of the post office network. The plan for banks to install cash machines in 3,000 post offices over the next 18 months appears to have been shelved - even though it was welcomed by the government when announced in February. The banks, which would have to pay the \u00a350,000 installation cost for each machine, have gone cold on the idea since they were forced to drop plans for charging customers using them. Only about a dozen machines have been installed.",

Freddo means cold, I remember that much, and dolce (nearly me) means sweet.</p> <p>I wonder if we will ever make beautiful Viennetta together. I think not, somehow. On our first night out, I distinctly heard Fred tell the waiter, \"I don't want Dulcie.\" Or was it pudding? There is little difference these days.</p> <p>Fred has no time for dalliance. He is preparing for an exhibition. He is busy with frames and labels. We are chaperoned, in any case, by our children. Fred's son has been tactless enough to bring his girlfriend, Emma. Harriet hated her at first, but soon discovered that she was more fun than the boy, who is blond, thickset and humourless. He is the fruit of Fred's early liaison with a Dane - female, presumably, which means that Fred must once have fancied a woman.</p> <p>This gives me no hope, though I wouldn't mind a bit of elderly adultery.

Freddo means cold, I remember that much, and dolce (nearly me) means sweet. I wonder if we will ever make beautiful Viennetta together. I think not, somehow. On our first night out, I distinctly heard Fred tell the waiter, \"I don't want Dulcie.\" Or was it pudding? There is little difference these days. Fred has no time for dalliance. He is preparing for an exhibition. He is busy with frames and labels. We are chaperoned, in any case, by our children. Fred's son has been tactless enough to bring his girlfriend, Emma. Harriet hated her at first, but soon discovered that she was more fun than the boy, who is blond, thickset and humourless. He is the fruit of Fred's early liaison with a Dane - female, presumably, which means that Fred must once have fancied a woman. This gives me no hope, though I wouldn't mind a bit of elderly adultery. Of course, 100% organic adultery is not possible, as I am not married.

On those days, at each of those retailers, the summer special offers come to an end, so you have until then to make the most of the prices that follow.</p> <p>Tesco has Taruso Ripassato Valpolicella Valpentena 1997 (16.5 points, out of 20, on offer at \u00a35.99). From Italy, this marvellous red exhibits wild strawberries, cherries, licorice, almonds and sweet lushness tempered by smooth tannins that will permit it to age with distinction for a further five or six years and become even lovelier (and, perhaps, reach 18 or 19 points). With its plumpness and depth, it will ride along with even the most robust of dishes.</p> <p>Tesco Chilean Merlot Reserve 1999 (16 points, down to \u00a33.99 ) has superb balance and lingering, leathery fruit with a meaty edge. TerraMater Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (16 points, offer price \u00a33.79), also from Chile, develops graduated rivulets of flavour that linger and refresh, enliven and delight, and create a gorgeously gluggable cabernet. </p> <p>Buzet Cuv\u00e9e 44 1997 (15 points, on offer at \u00a33.99), from France, is stuffed with generous tannins and savoury fruit, and makes a terrific casserole red. TerraMater Chardonnay 1999 (15.5 points, offer price \u00a33.79), likewise from Chile, is deliciously textured and plump, has a fruit mix of subtle dexterity, and a calm, cool finish of class and precision. And, for a truly delightfully sparkling end to summer, it is worth considering a ros\u00e9 of real style in the shape of Lindauer Brut Ros\u00e9, from New Zealand, which rates 15 points and which has slumped in price to \u00a36.49. Personally, I find this ros\u00e9 infinitely preferable to many a more expensive liquid from Rheims.</p> <p>At Morrisons, there is a charming Aussie pair: Lindemans Bin 50 Shiraz 1998 (14.5 points, now \u00a33.99) and Lindemans Bin 65 Chardonnay 1999 (16.5 points, now \u00a33.99). The shiraz has kiss-me-quick, sunny, holiday-romance fruit; the chardonnay, which is more substantial and elegant, can be taken home and introduced, with profit, to one's relatives. Inycon Chardonnay 1999, from Sicily, is down to \u00a33.99, and this superb 16-point wine parades rich melon undertones to its slightly smoky fruit, and finishes clean and fresh with an undertone of minerals and lemon. Also from Italy at Morrisons is the politely fruity Di Notte Pinot Grigio 1999 (14 points, down to \u00a32.99), which offers subtle apricot sensations to accompany - even, dare I say, richly to enhance - fish and chips.</p> <p>At Safeway, Rosemount Estate Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.99) can consider itself one of the most stylish whites on this retailer's shelves, while Lindemans Cawarra Chardonnay 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.49) is one of its biggest bargains. The Rosemount has a touch of warm butter and is finely textured. Cawarra, more playful, goes from ripe melon to dusky pear and lemon. </p> <p>Sauvignon Blanc Cuv\u00e9e R\u00e9serve Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.49) is a rich softie, and is not the classic dry style of sauvignon. Viognier Cuv\u00e9e R\u00e9serve Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.49) is nutty with a subtle peachiness, and makes a superb ap\u00e9ritif. Anciennes Vignes Carignan Vin de Pays de l'Aude 1998 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99) has impressive tannins; and TerraMater Zinfandel/Syrah 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a33.99), from Chile, gallops juicily over the tastebuds in fairly rumbustious fashion, then leaves a lush, savoury, ruddy afterglow.</p> <p>Last, there is Unwins, a timeless retailer, but no less a purveyor of bargains. Such things do not come much bonnier than La Palmeria Merlot 1999, from Chile. Rating 17 points and costing \u00a34.99, this wine has fantastic, savoury fruit of dryly textured tenacity and great aplomb. A teasing tobacco edge to the tannins gives the wine complexity, class and cohesion.</p>",

That's nothing to be ashamed of, but why not experiment with . . . </p> <p><strong> The details</strong><br> Oil: take your pick. Extra-virgin olive (natch), sesame, hazelnut, walnut, citrus, pumpkin-seed - anything short of Castrol is fair game, but use high-flavour oils in moderation. </p> <p>Vinegar: the choice is even more awe-inspiring. Basic, straight-ahead, industrial wine vinegar is the saladier's mainstay. But for more character (and a higher price), think balsamic, Champagne, varietally specified (eg, cabernet sauvignon), sherry, rice, etc. I'd stop short of Golden Whisk Smoky Lap-Souchong Chinese Tea Vinegar (<a href=\"http://www.specialtyfoodsnet.com\">www.specialtyfoodsnet.com</a>), but it's a free country.</p> <p>Moderation is advisable here, too. Best of all, when you feel like getting fancy, what about these optional add-ons, which make dressing salad an adventure. For another layer of flavour, think lemon or lime, soy sauce, Worcester sauce, dry vermouth, fino sherry, yogurt, etc again. For solid matter-wise, choose between alliums, mustard, herbs both fresh and dry, blue cheese, Parmesan, morsels of olive, gherkin, capers, tomato, capsicums, anchovies, ginger, etc yet again.</p> <p>For extra body, think mayo, cream, ricotta, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, leftover gravy, heavily reduced meat stock; more etcs. Let your imagination run wild through the larder. Dieter's tip: oil-free dressing never reaches divine status, but sieved ricotta is a reasonable facsimile. Everyone's tip: think of basic salad dressing as a canvas on which to apply layers of flavour. </p> <p><strong> Where to buy</strong><br> The Knowledge's preferred mail-order source for anything oleaginous or acetic is The Oil Merchant (020-8740 1335). Otherwise, a swanky food shop is your best hunting ground. One such, Harvey Nichols (020-7235 5000), sells around 100 oils and 35 vinegars.

      "bodyText": "The subject Oil and vinegar, variations on a theme. The basics The standard salad dressing contains three parts oil to one part vinegar, plus salt and pepper. That's nothing to be ashamed of, but why not experiment with . . . The details Oil: take your pick. Extra-virgin olive (natch), sesame, hazelnut, walnut, citrus, pumpkin-seed - anything short of Castrol is fair game, but use high-flavour oils in moderation. Vinegar: the choice is even more awe-inspiring. Basic, straight-ahead, industrial wine vinegar is the saladier's mainstay. But for more character (and a higher price), think balsamic, Champagne, varietally specified (eg, cabernet sauvignon), sherry, rice, etc. I'd stop short of Golden Whisk Smoky Lap-Souchong Chinese Tea Vinegar (www.specialtyfoodsnet.com), but it's a free country. Moderation is advisable here, too. Best of all, when you feel like getting fancy, what about these optional add-ons, which make dressing salad an adventure. For another layer of flavour, think lemon or lime, soy sauce, Worcester sauce, dry vermouth, fino sherry, yogurt, etc again. For solid matter-wise, choose between alliums, mustard, herbs both fresh and dry, blue cheese, Parmesan, morsels of olive, gherkin, capers, tomato, capsicums, anchovies, ginger, etc yet again. For extra body, think mayo, cream, ricotta, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, leftover gravy, heavily reduced meat stock; more etcs. Let your imagination run wild through the larder. Dieter's tip: oil-free dressing never reaches divine status, but sieved ricotta is a reasonable facsimile. Everyone's tip: think of basic salad dressing as a canvas on which to apply layers of flavour. Where to buy The Knowledge's preferred mail-order source for anything oleaginous or acetic is The Oil Merchant (020-8740 1335). Otherwise, a swanky food shop is your best hunting ground. One such, Harvey Nichols (020-7235 5000), sells around 100 oils and 35 vinegars. Not a bad start. The easy way out Bottled dressing? Anything they can do, you can do better.",

This is quite an admission in a society that has long believed passionately in the virtues of positive thinking. Most Americans still do. They think that cheerfulness and optimism are the keys not only to success in life and in business, but also to a person's health and well-being. But at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, in Washington last month, a group of psychologists started to question the absolute truth of this article of faith. </p> <p>At a symposium entitled The (Overlooked) Virtues Of Negativity, they did not deny the usefulness of positive thinking in most circumstances, but they verged on heresy by agreeing that cheerfulness could sometimes be taken too far. Perpetual pressure to be upbeat made some people feel worse instead of better, they said. According to their most forceful representative, Dr Barbara Held, the author of Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching (which is Yiddish slang for complaining), many Americans are suffering because they are not allowed to feel bad. \"Life is very hard,\" she says. \"If you're having a hard time with something, it can make it harder to cope if you feel pressure to act okay when you're not.\" </p> <p>The symposium heard about research showing ways in which negativism could be helpful. For example, some people, whom psychologists call \"defensive pessimists\", like to set unrealistically low expectations for themselves in order to cope with a challenge. If, say, a \"defensive pessimist\" is growing increasingly anxious about a forthcoming public-speaking engagement, he doesn't try to persuade himself that it will all be fine on the night, but instead imagines tripping over the microphone cord, dropping his notes, or having a coughing fit. </p> <p>This may sound like a recipe for disaster; but according to the psychologist that conducted this bit of research, the \"defensive pessimist\" responds to such a nightmare scenario by taking steps to prevent it happening, like putting the microphone cord out of harm's way before beginning his speech, or by placing a glass of water on the lectern. \"This mental rehearsal tends to make defensive pessimists feel less anxious, and so they actually perform better,\" the psychologist says. Conversely, \"strategic optimists\", as their opposites are called, do equally well by banishing all thoughts of possible mishaps and anticipating triumph. </p> <p>Other research presented to the symposium undermined the widely-held belief that positive thinking makes people healthier. \"There's some reasonably compelling evidence to suggest that when people are falsely peppy and upbeat and chipper, it's not very healthy,\" reported Dr James Pennebaker. Nervous, unhappy people, prone to chronic complaining, were no more unhealthy, no more likely to visit the doctor, to develop high blood pressure, or to die, than cheerful, bouncy ones. </p> <p>The psychologists did not deal with the main point I made in my February column, which was that moaning and whingeing is what confers dignity and independence and a sense of freedom on even the humblest wage slave. That was why I objected to Greg Dyke's ultimatum to his staff at the BBC that they should either stop moaning or leave, for I regarded this as an attack on basic workers' rights. But these psychologists have nevertheless made a small contribution towards the great task of emancipating the shy and the gloomy and the miserable, who presently are the main victims of discrimination in the US. </p> <p> Anthony Holden, the British journalist and writer, announced in last Sunday's Observer that he is going to settle permanently in the United States because of his weariness with Britain's stuffiness, conservatism and racism, and his admiration for America as \"a nation based on the simple, pure intent of seeing if all the peoples of the world can live and work together, side by side, in mutually supportive harmony\". </p> <p>His article included a long and bitter whinge about Britain (for which I do not blame him: he should write as he feels); but now that he is converted from \"defensive pessimism\" to \"strategic optimism\" and living in the nation he likes best, I hope he'll be tolerant of those in his adopted country who feel less than happy with their lot. According to one study presented to the psychologists' symposium, such gloom-mongers are predominant among Asian Americans, who are more pessimistic than Caucasian-Americans and more likely to use pessimism as a way of coping with life.</p>",

Why, then, does my heart not skip a beat in sheer molten gratitude, as the men in white coats believe the hearts of all sexually active women across the nation should? </p> <p>Lots of reasons, actually; let's start with the ignoble, demeaning cliche. Are women, who are notoriously better at remembering things than men, really going to gamble with their hard-won controlled fertility on the backs of a breed who can barely remember one birthday and one anniversary a year, let alone to take a pill more than 200 times during it? And, at the risk of sounding like an Anthony Trollope novel, Do You Really Trust Him?</p> <p>I know well from talking to my younger friends that these days it is often the male half of a couple who yearns to hear the patter of tiny trainers, while the distaff side desires nothing more than to concentrate on her career before she comes anywhere near having that greasy stuff smeared on her stomach so they can give her a scan. Take one broody man, one woman with an irrational prejudice against abortion, stir in the male Pill and voila! - a liar's charter. </p> <p>Not only does the male Pill hold the possibility of making your man into a liar, don't you think that, even supposing he remembers to take it and you remain childless, it makes him a bit of a daddy, too? Your daddy, that is: there is something rather unwholesomely I can't-handle-this-nasty-contraception-thing-look-after-me-please about handing responsibility for your sexuality over to someone else. </p> <p>And it works both ways; not only does he become The Boss, but you become a Good Girl, rather more so than is good for any romantic relationship. If you're handing over contraception duties to him, your husband/boyfriend's going to trust you a touch too much; if there's no chance of anybody but him picking them apples, they're going to start looking not half as juicy.</p> <p>This is not to say that actively attempting to make your spouse jealous is anything but pathetic. But on the other hand, what he imagines you getting up to on your nights off is nothing to do with you. Many studies show that the stronger the suspicion that his gal is not altogether dead from the waist down where other men are concerned, the more your average man makes a big effort to be good in bed. The old chestnut \"Treat 'em mean and keep 'em keen\", always the fastest way to become catnip to boys, mutates into \"Keep 'em sure and be a bore\" when we imagine a male pill. </p> <p>Then there's the fact that I like a quiet life, as I'm sure you do. After two marriages of (to paraphrase Living Doll) screaming, squawking, keening, sulking hysterics, I am now lucky enough to be going steady with a young man of almost unbelievable sweet temper. Long exposure to such sunniness has rendered me, too, extremely easy-going and barely recognisable as my uptight 80s self, and I have no desire to return to this tormented state.</p> <p>One of the main reasons for marital discord is, I believe, the mad, modern desire to share everything, from household tasks to bank accounts. The key to domestic harmony, on the other hand, is to divide everything, so that each has his job and doesn't interfere with the other one. Hence I would no more dream of letting my boyfriend drive my fertility than I would dream of trying to drive his car. Stick to what you're best at, and happiness will result. </p> <p>Let's face it, romantic relationships are full of arguments just waiting to happen, and sharing rather than dividing tasks is the quickest way to end up in a whirlwind of resentment and martyrdom; it also leaves women wide open to that eternal dirty dig of \"nagging\". And there's worse. If you get pregnant through your own miscalculations or poor memory skills, you're going to breathe a quick \"Ooo! Stupid cow\" before booking that lunchtime termination. If he gets you pregnant through his own inefficiency or idleness, the potential for relationship-wrecking fights is limitless. You're not going to forgive him quickly, if at all. </p> <p>Then again, it's political. Women fought and died and worried their brains in order to help you gain control of your one and only body. Are you really happy to hand yours over to a man, no matter how benign, just because bothering with contraception is a \"drag\"? Yeah, voting's pretty annoying, innit, having to drag yourself down to the polling station - I know, why not let your husband vote for you, too? Then you'll have even more time to spend at the hairdresser. </p> <p> As politicians are always telling us, you can't have rights without responsibilities. If this is so, it's very likely that the reverse is true, too. Let a man share responsibility for your reproductive system, and before long he is going to feel that he has rights over it; in short, he is going to become one of those men you hear of in America who burst into the operating room just before aforementioned lunchtime abortion and start screaming scary crap about it being his ickle baby, too! </p> <p>My last reason for being sceptical about a male Pill is the most embarrassing, and the hardest to put across without sounding as though I have swallowed one too many Black Lace books, but bear with me. I actually like the idea of aggressive, rampaging sperm, and of my duty as a healthy, modern, selfish woman to evade and frustrate them at every turn. </p> <p>Day in and day out, the sexually active woman who refuses to obey Nature's dictat that she becomes a walking incubator once a year for 20 years scores a near triumph against the tyranny of biology: if the man's firing blanks to begin with, it does rob us of our victory somewhat.</p> <p>In the eternal battle between sperm and ovum, I want to be Bette Davis, walking all over the opposition in Fuck-Me shoes; I don't want to be Jennifer Aniston, muddling meekly through with a lot of help from her friends. And while I may be an extreme case, I feel that for a lot of women the merest likelihood of conception makes sex more exciting; I've only known one girl who was married to a man who had a vasectomy, and whereas before she had been perfectly faithful to him, within three weeks she had run off with an imperfect stranger she met at a party. Mind you, the dumped hubster was a sexually repellent premature ejaculator, so that might have had some bearing on it. </p> <p>Phew, that's better. But to get back to basics, I would suggest that if a woman is so loathe to organise something as fundamental as her own fertility, it could be a sign that she isn't that interested in sex anyway - \"He wants it so much, let him arrange it!\" - in which case, perhaps you simply shouldn't be doing it at all. Now there is a revolutionary thought.</p>",

Let a man share responsibility for your reproductive system, and before long he is going to feel that he has rights over it; in short, he is going to become one of those men you hear of in America who burst into the operating room just before aforementioned lunchtime abortion and start screaming scary crap about it being his ickle baby, too! My last reason for being sceptical about a male Pill is the most embarrassing, and the hardest to put across without sounding as though I have swallowed one too many Black Lace books, but bear with me. I actually like the idea of aggressive, rampaging sperm, and of my duty as a healthy, modern, selfish woman to evade and frustrate them at every turn. Day in and day out, the sexually active woman who refuses to obey Nature's dictat that she becomes a walking incubator once a year for 20 years scores a near triumph against the tyranny of biology: if the man's firing blanks to begin with, it does rob us of our victory somewhat. In the eternal battle between sperm and ovum, I want to be Bette Davis, walking all over the opposition in Fuck-Me shoes; I don't want to be Jennifer Aniston, muddling meekly through with a lot of help from her friends. And while I may be an extreme case, I feel that for a lot of women the merest likelihood of conception makes sex more exciting; I've only known one girl who was married to a man who had a vasectomy, and whereas before she had been perfectly faithful to him, within three weeks she had run off with an imperfect stranger she met at a party. Mind you, the dumped hubster was a sexually repellent premature ejaculator, so that might have had some bearing on it. Phew, that's better. But to get back to basics, I would suggest that if a woman is so loathe to organise something as fundamental as her own fertility, it could be a sign that she isn't that interested in sex anyway - \"He wants it so much, let him arrange it!\" - in which case, perhaps you simply shouldn't be doing it at all. Now there is a revolutionary thought.",

I had better make clear that I am talking about coriander seed here, not the leaves, which come from the same plant. The flavour of coriander seeds has been likened to orange peel by two not inconsiderable authorities, Elizabeth David and Tom Stobart. It is a very good comparison, but in truth coriander is spicier and more complex than that, having a slightly bitter, minerally edge to it. It has a long history in British cooking, albeit on and off: late Bronze Age tourists brought coriander with them to add a bit of zip to their barley gruel, and there is mention of it in Elizabethan herbals; however, it has been predominantly used in pickles, brines and chutneys. Coriander has always been an important flavour here, prized as highly as cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.</p> <p>Somehow, we have lost our forefathers' passion for cooking with spices at home. We can apparently whip up Thai curries with the ease and familiarity of making a milkshake, yet still regard cooking with real spices through suspicious eyes. We hand over great wads of cash to eat the food termed \"fusion\", yet mutter under our breaths if Indian restaurants get smart or charge more than \u00a310 a head. This is a nonsense. Go buy a coffee grinder, and have a stab at making a food that needs to be looked at again as something other than a convenience. All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b>Grilled pork chop with spiced quinces</b></p> <p>The quinces are a preserve and keep well, but there is no rule that says you can't eat them within a day or two of the making. When served with pork of fine descent, it makes you wonder why this fabulous fruit appears so rarely at British tables. I know why, but for some reason a pound to a pint always makes a better preserve than a litre to a kilo.</p> <p><b> 8 quinces <br> 1 heaped dssp sea salt <br> Water<br> White sugar <br> Very good white-wine vinegar <br> Coriander seeds<br> Cumin seeds<br> 1-2 pork chops per person<br> Black pepper</b></p> <p>Wipe off any fluff that covers the fruit, then peel and core them. Cut the fruit into eight or so pieces, place them in a pot, cover with water and add the sea salt. Bring the pot to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes or so. Strain the liquid from the fruit, reserving it for later, and return the fruit to the pot. Measure the cooking liquid in a jug, and for every pint add a pound of white sugar, a quarter pint of vinegar, a teaspoon of gently roasted coriander seeds and a half-teaspoon of gently roasted cumin seeds. Pour everything into the fruit pot, and simmer until the fruit is tender.</p> <p>With a slotted spoon, transfer the fruit to scrupulously clean and dry jars. Continue cooking the liquid for a further 10 minutes, until you have a thick, flavourful syrup. Pour this over the quince pieces and seal the jars.</p> <p>The breed of pig you buy will decide whether one or two chops is required per person, but once this decision has been made the only other things you need are sea salt and a fully-charged pepper mill. The bold may wish, when roasting the cumin for the chutney, to cook a few more teaspoons of seeds, then add these to salt and pepper, and rub this into the meat. Cook the chops over a flame, under a grill or in a heavy-based frying pan, though do not let the pepper over-blacken and so turn bitter.</p> <p><b> Chickpea pancakes with cumin</b></p> <p>Though it may not be traditional, these go wonderfully with many Mediterranean dishes, as well as Indian ones. If your local shop does not stock chickpea flour, try an Asian grocer.</p> <p><b> 2 medium-sized ripe tomatoes <br> 8 spring onions <br> 225g chickpea flour <br> 1 pinch cayenne pepper<br> 1 tsp salt <br> 1 tsp cumin seeds <br> Vegetable oil, for frying</b></p> <p>Bring a pan of water to the boil, blanch the tomatoes for 30 seconds, then peel, seed and chop finely. Trim and thinly slice the spring onions.</p> <p>Sift the flour and cayenne pepper into a bowl, and slowly pour in 300ml of cold water, whisking furiously as you do so (chickpea flour is so fine that it tends to form lumps easily). Add the salt, cumin, chopped tomato and spring onion to the batter, mix thoroughly and leave to stand for half an hour or so.</p> <p>If you have a trusty griddle or pancake pan, then use accordingly, though I must confess that I prefer the ease and pleasure of a non-stick frying pan. Heat your pan of choice, pour in a thin film of oil, stir the batter with a ladle, then lift enough batter into the pan to cover its base. Cook until lightly browned on the bottom, then flip over and cook until the other side is also lightly browned. Repeat thus, piling the pancakes on a plate, covered, to keep them warm. Serve with a few salad leaves and some spiced beans (see below).</p> <p><b> French beans and potatoes with cumin and fennel</b></p> <p>I find this delicious, hot or cold, with any amount of fried or grilled meats. Make lots of it, as it is really good the next day, too.</p> <p><b> 300g waxy small potatoes <br> 1 small onion <br> 2 cloves garlic <br> 1 thumb-size piece ginger <br> 3 tbsp vegetable oil<br> 1 tsp cumin seeds <br> 1 tsp fennel seeds<br> 450g green beans, topped and tailed <br> 1 tsp ground coriander <br> 1 tsp ground cumin <br> 1/2 tsp turmeric <br> 1/3 tsp cayenne <br> Sea salt and black pepper <br> 60g chopped fresh tomato<br> 1 big handful coriander leaves, chopped</b></p> <p>Scrub the potatoes (only peel them if you really want to - it's not at all necessary), boil them until cooked through, then drain. Peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and ginger. Heat a large, heavy frying pan, add the oil, then the whole cumin and fennel seeds, and stir for a few seconds only. Add the onion, ginger and garlic, and fry for a couple of minutes until lightly coloured.</p> <p>Tip in the beans and the cooked potatoes. Add the remaining spices, mix everything together, then pour in 120ml of boiling water and leave to simmer, covered, for eight minutes or so. Add the tomato and coriander leaves, and simmer for a few minutes more, until the beans are fully cooked.</p> <p><b> Cauliflower fritters with coriander chutney</b></p> <p>In the cooking of India, these are called pakoris and are quite delicious.</p> <p><b> For the chutney</b></p> <p><b>1 large handful coriander leaves <br> 1 small red chilli, chopped fine<br> 300g good plain yoghurt <br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> ? tsp salt <br> 1/3 tsp ground black pepper <br> 1 tsp roasted cumin seeds, ground</b></p> <p><b>For the fritters</b></p> <p><b>125g chickpea flour<br> Water<br> 1/2 tsp salt<br> 1/2 tsp turmeric <br> ? tsp ground cumin <br> 1/2 tsp baking powder <br> 1/3 tsp ground black pepper <br> 1/3 tsp cayenne pepper<br> 1 large head cauliflower<br> Light frying oil, such as groundnut</b></p> <p>First, make the chutney, which can be done earlier in the day, and refrigerated. Wash the coriander, put it into a liquidiser, along with a tablespoon of water, and blend to a paste. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Decant into a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Put the chickpea flour into a bowl and slowly whisk in 200ml of cold water. Err towards having batter with a thicker consistency, so that it will fully coat the cauliflower. Add the spices and seasoning, and mix until smooth.</p> <p>Cut the cauliflower into florets of roughly 2-3cm in length, rinse it free of any sleeping caterpillars and the like, then dry thoroughly. Heat a deep-fat fryer according to the manufacturer's instructions, and when you are ready dip the florets into the batter and drop them carefully and gently into the oil. Cook only a few at a time, so that the fat remains hot and the fritters do not stick together. Drain, and repeat the cooking process until all are done, then serve on a cloth along with a hearty dollop of chutney</p> <p><b> Technical Tips</b></p> <p>\u0095 Buy your spices whole, only in small quantities and often - they lose their fragrance if kept for more than three or four months. Ready-ground spices lose their freshness even more quickly.</p> <p>\u0095 Store spices in airtight jars out of the light: light is a great enemy to spices (as it is to herbs and olive oil).</p> <p>\u0095 Grind the spices only as and when you need to use them. It is worth buying a coffee grinder just for this purpose (they cost around \u00a310).</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, London SE1.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I met John Turturro in New York, in his beautiful Brooklyn brownstone, which may once have housed five families but which is now the home for himself, his wife the actress Katherine Borowitz, their son Amedeo, and soon-to-be child due in December.</p> <p>Later, in a midsummer monsoon, he drove me back to Manhattan. He was on his way to a meeting with the producer of the television drama The Sopranos; there is a part that they'd like him to consider.</p> <p>\"Somehow I don't see John in The Sopranos, do you?\" Katherine had said. </p> <p>Driving, he explained: \"He is a powerful man. And in this business you have to be polite.\"</p> <p>Following the meeting, he was going back to Brooklyn to stay the night with his mother, take her to hospital the next day for a cataract operation, probably stay with her that night, too. \"I'll call to let you know when I'll be home,\" he told his wife. Then slung a few clothes into an overnight bag, put on a full length plastic windcheater, tied up the hood and went round the block to fetch the car. There is a modest ease about this man. Which is not to say he's not intense. There is a kind of tension in his very bearing, 6ft 1in and densely packed - a former athlete, a great dancer - that translates on the screen into a powerful, visceral presence. It's not difficult to imagine that he could be hard work. But what he's not doing is hiding. </p> <p>In the car he had told me about the time he was rung by Stanley Kubrick. \"He wanted me for a part in Eyes Wide Shut.\" Turturro was interested. He chooses most of his parts according to who the director is. \"But I was busy directing my second film, Illuminata, and couldn't be free for six months, and that's not the way that Kubrick worked. He wanted total commitment from the beginning.\"</p> <p>Afterwards, when he saw the film, he was glad not to have been in it. \"It was so childish, stupid. The idea that a man can't handle his wife's fantasies. Everyone has fantasies, everyone is tempted. It's part of all our experience. It's how you act on those fantasies.\"</p> <p>And, as he says, it happens all the time in movies, actors falling for each other. It happened to him once. Once in the 20 years that he and Katherine have been together he fell for someone else. \"That was hard for everyone.\" In the end, nothing happened. He didn't act on it. \"Because I know that an action can hurt a person, really hurt them. And when you know this and you love someone, you can't do it, even though you may want to do it.\" </p> <p>Funnily enough, this is the subject of Illuminata, previously a play entitled Imperfect Love written by his good friend Brandon Cole, and adapted as a screenplay by Turturro. Somehow, without knowing it, and simultaneously, he was working on the perfect antidote to Kubrick's cloying sentimental drama, making a film \"about staying in love rather than falling in or falling out of love - that middle period, the one we're all involved with\".</p> <p>The film hasn't had a release in Europe. Go see it, he said, before you leave the States. \"It has a lot of me in it. It will tell you a lot about me.\" Where is the lie, the film asks. In falling for someone? No. Where is the hurt? In admitting it - to yourself, to another? Some hurt maybe. But the far bigger lie, the bigger hurt is in concealment. Because how can you love when part of you is hidden and, more to the point, how can you be loved if you don't allow yourself to be seen? </p> <p>Translate this into his work, which he also loves - I don't think I have ever met an actor so passionately critical of his job. How do you remain faithful to an idea of acting that you had as a scholarship kid at Yale Drama School before you became a movie actor, when idealism was the air that everyone breathed. It was easy then, a couple of off-off-Broadway plays a year - Ibsen, Ionesco, John Patrick Shanley - everyone in the same boat, broke, filling in time teaching or working on a construction site. Then, if you took a bit part in Exterminator 2, it wasn't you that was involved, it wasn't your heart - it was more like a high school date, something you did to pass the time while you waited for the real thing to come along.</p> <p>He got typecast early on in movies. \"Violent, volatile characters and stuff\", like the character of Heinz in Tony Bill's 1988 film 5 Corners, a psychotic who throws his mother out of a first-floor window and kills his girlfriend Jodie Foster's pet penguin. The suave accomplice in Michael Cimino's The Sicilian. The pool hustler in Scorsese's The Color Of Money. But since these were the films that got him noticed, he's loyal to them. \"After all, there's a humanity in violence, in brutality.\" </p> <p>Then he got lucky, his word. In the late 80s, early 90s he began his collaboration with the directors Spike Lee and with the Coen Brothers, playing Pino, Danny Aiello's racist son in Do The Right Thing, and Bernie Bernbaum in the Coens' Miller's Crossing - still nasties, but in both films forcing his way against type, bringing the audience in, which is his great gift, so that you feel for these otherwise loathsome creatures. You see them subjectively not objectively.</p> <p>Playing the snivelling bully Bernie Bernbaum, he says he remembered a time as a kid when someone pulled a gun on him and suddenly everything slowed down and started going backwards. \"And I thought, that's how Bernie views the world\" - ie, through a lens of fear. It is a definitive portrayal of cowardice, and when Tom, Gabriel Byrne's character, shoots him at point-blank range through the head, it becomes a judgment on Tom not on Bernie - though no one ever deserved it more. </p> <p>\"I don't judge characters,\" Turturro has said, \"I just play them.\" Like he doesn't judge people and doesn't expect or invite judgment. \"I am what I do.\" So if he doesn't like something he just moves away from it? \"No,\" he says. \"I can be confrontational, I've got a temper, I get edgy when I am under pressure. But mostly my feet are on the ground and I know if it's my fault.\" </p> <p>There was no conscious decision about his career. \"Just when I found I had a bit of choice, I started to pick roles that were more challenging and difficult, because that interests me. I like films in which people come out sensitised, thinking - because I like it when that's done to me.\"</p> <p> Could he be tempted now by a blockbuster such as Mission Impossible or Gladiator? \"Sure,\" he says. \"Absolutely, I could be tempted. But I've made the decisions I've made. If I were to do the other thing, make movies that are escapist or entertainment, I'd be richer, but I don't know what I'd do with the money. Buy a bigger house. Have plastic surgery maybe.\" </p> <p>Somehow, whenever he's been offered \"big\" movies there has always been something else going on, something he wants to do more. \"They wanted me for Men In Black, a good film for what it was. But I was about to make Francesco Rosi's The Truce, adapted from Primo Levi's book, about an Auschwitz survivor, a film I'd been involved with for five years, so there was no choice for me.\" He turned down Home Alone. \"That was because I didn't realise how big it would be.\" You can always regret things, he says. \"You could say I should have done Home Alone, because then I would have had the money to buy our house sooner. We could have had our babies sooner\" - a genuine anxiety when your wife is 43 and expecting a second child. \"But do I regret it creatively? No.\" </p> <p>Everyone has their own way of doing things: take Ralph Fiennes, whom he acted opposite in Quiz Show. \"Ralph's found a way to do what he wants to do. He'll do a little bit of the other stuff and then go off and do a Chekhov or something. Other people have a struggle 'I have to do all these things just in order to do this.' It's a high price to pay.\" And it doesn't always pay off. \"I remember when I first saw Gary Oldman, he was a great good actor, one of the most exciting actors I've seen.\" Now, so many villains down the line, I guess Turturro thinks he lost it. \"How many crazy guys can you do... and when you could do so much more. I don't know if that's what's happened to him, his film [Nil By Mouth] was great. But there is only so much of that stuff you can do and then people start to see you differently. I think sometimes you may be better off if you don't do that.\" </p> <p>George Clooney, he says, has cracked it. Clooney he has just finished working with on the Coens' O Brother, Where Art Thou?, a hillbilly romp and a musical, with Clooney as a kind of Ulysses figure, an escaped con, trying to find his way back to his home and the woman he loves. Turturro plays one of his two accomplices. \"George is a nice guy, very talented and very smart. He knows where he's at and he's made the system work for him. He made his money in TV and now he can do what he wants in films. He's still learning about film; he's come from TV, he works very fast, he wants everything done in one. But he's trying to do what he can. I am a fan.\" </p> <p>When Turturro talks like this he is not being covertly bitchy. Most actors don't talk critically or analytically about the system they work in - except sometimes to rubbish Hollywood - but then it's always the studios, the anonymous autonomy. Everything with Turturro is personal, subjective. It's his way of being. Like he said about his fantasies. If I am not straight with you, then who will be straight with me when my turn comes round? If there were only one thing to be said about Turturro, it is that he is not afraid. </p> <p>The Coen Brothers put it better, and more revealingly - certainly in terms of the actor. \"It's amazing how he allows himself to be humiliated in front of the camera.\" Humiliation is a tricky word, with its connotations of self-abasement. This kind of humiliation is Bernie Bernbaum pleading for his life, instead of taking the bullet like a man, as his macho world insists. But there's another kind of humiliation that is at the extreme end of embarrassment, in which you see yourself as you are seen. The ability to do this, to expose yourself at will and in public, is acting - anything else is simply playing at acting. </p> <p>Turturro has said that he learned everything he knows about acting from his father, who was an Italian immigrant construction worker. An honest guy, \"to a fault\", extremely physical, tough, and violent. He frightened his three sons. Turturro is the middle child: \"Always in the middle, always juggling, that's where I stand in life.\" And no doubt he frightened his wife. He used to hit her, \"not a lot, but it did happen\", and it was always John who intervened. \"For some reason my older brother was more afraid than I.\" His mother, he says, always knew \"I'd hit my father if he went too far\".</p> <p>So he grew up in Queens, in a house \"where you always had to be aware that something could happen because of his temper\". And that gave him an ability to read situations, to sense what was going on. \"It was a great house to grow up in if you wanted to be an actor. You lived moment to moment, there was a lot of black humour.\" They'd all play it carefully, \"follow my mother's lead, never come on to him\". And so he learned \"that if you do something to someone it has a repercussion\". </p> <p>This is what acting is about, he says. You do something and you follow it through to the next move and then the next - a bit like a game of chess - constantly alert to the new possibility. In bad actors, he says, you see this mistake all the time - \"They do something and you want to tell them, 'You can't do that and be so relaxed about it because you don't know what will happen, you haven't thought it out.' It's hard to explain this to someone who hasn't had my kind of experience.\" </p> <p>And yet he says he loved his father. \"We had a good relationship. I kind of understood him.\" He understood the brutality of his father's world, having no money and the powerlessness of that. How powerlessness leads to bullying. How no one is one thing. \"He could be very sensitive, too, and funny. He talked a lot and about everything.\" He taught him some good things - about passion, about loving work. \"He was never sloppy, never lazy.\" And about a kind of immersion, of personalising things. \"If my father was watching a movie, he was in that movie.\" </p> <p>After his father died of a heart attack Turturro found it very hard to get over the loss. \"The fact that you don't see that person again, that you can't have him again.\" His mother told him that even in his deathbed delirium he was talking about work back at the construction site, ordering people around, \"where he had been happy\". In 1989, soon after his death, Turturro wrote and directed a largely autobiographical film, Mac, based on his father and his childhood experience of his family, in which he played his father and which in 1992 won Best First Film Award at Cannes. He had originally written it as a play with Brandon Cole in 1980. He spent 12 years getting it to the screen. He didn't make it out of respect for his father - \"Not only that. It seemed to me you don't see films about people like this, no education, no privilege. There are a lot of worlds whose stories are never told. I didn't want to make a sentimental portrait of Italian home life. I wanted it warts and all.\" Watching it later, he was surprised \"at how uninhibited I was\". </p> <p>As a kid he took all the responsibility, \"just about all of it\", and that's continued into his adult life. \"I'd do anything I can to help. I have no qualms about being the one that can make things better - give them money, buy them something. I'll lie, be inventive if I have to, if there's something I can do for one of them. When they're okay, then I can do my stuff.\" His elder brother has had drug problems: \"He was always fragile. Probably he needed help when he was young and he didn't get it. By the time he did it was too late.\" His younger brother s an actor: \"He has a lot of talent, but I don't know if he's ever going to get out of himself all that he could.\" As he says, there are repercussions. </p> <p>He has never been a depressive, he says. \"I think you have to have a predisposition to that, and if I get blue I try to put it into something, incorporate it into something I am doing.\" He gets emotional. \"But emotion is not depressing.\" And he gets irritated - that some of what he considers to be his finest work has not been widely acclaimed; that a film such as Francesco Rosi's The Truce, in which he played Primo Levi - \"a great film from a great book written by one of the greatest writers about the Holocaust\" - got almost no audience compared with a film such as Life Is Beautiful.</p> <p>\"Of course it bothers me. That our wonderful, meditative, non histrionic film didn't do as well as it deserved. And you see a film like that and how successful it can be and it's just a fairy-tale. You'd think there could have been a place for something else, that people could have been moved by something that showed the other side of the fairy-tale. But that's how it is. That's the nature of the beast. I work here and it's a market place that's very adolescent.\" Time, anyway, he says, is the test of greatness. \"It took a long time for Levi to find a publisher for his book. I think The Truce will survive. Time will be good to it.\" </p> <p>He is an optimist, in his life, in his work, but also a pragmatist. He chooses carefully, the people around him. \"I don't like to be around people who are neurotic.\" And the people he works with. He has made four films with the Coens, who are great, he says. \"I have never been unhappy. They always ask me to do things they haven't seen me do, and anything I've done they have always made look better. That's a lot in movies. They wrote Barton Fink for me. What more can you ask? And as people they are kind, thoughtful, together, talented, not macho. If their films were half as good as they are I'd still want to work with them because of the kind of people they are.\" Ditto Spike Lee. Though he has some criticisms, of Jungle Fever in particular. \"My side story was so much stronger than the central character in that film. I think at one time he wanted to make it the main character, I think he would have... but he didn't.\" They are still good friends. \"He just hasn't had that much for me recently. You know, you work well with someone, you think you'll work together more. But then, no. That's how it is. When my friends have roles for me I am thrilled to do it. I love it.\" </p> <p>He has three films opening shortly: the Coens' O Brother, Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried, and Dutch director Marleen Gorris's The Luzhin Defence, from a Nabakov novella, in which he plays the lead. It is not his best film. \"There are a couple of things I am disappointed about, little things that didn't make it in.\" But, as he says, it's a hard book and hard to adapt - movies have to simplify. \"Favourite things go as you try to make it more understandable. Really, I have to see it a couple more times before I can say.\"</p> <p>In lots of ways I think he'll be pleased. There are all sorts of criticisms that can be made of the film as an adaptation. It has become a morality tale, in a way Nabakov never intended. It's far too explicit, the introduction of a demonic character, not in the book, over-simplifies. The ending is so compressed as to be unrecognisable. But it doesn't matter. Turturro is wonderful as Luzhin, a grand chess master who comes to the Italian lakes to play the tournament of his life and falls in love. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role, except maybe Pacino before he played The Godfather. So, impossible, in other words. </p> <p>Nabakov wrote it as the story of a man who can't get outside his own head. Chess, the only thing he knows how to do, and consequently the only thing he loves, will kill him, and yet he can't survive without it. \"I have seen that with people I have known and it is a tragedy.\" In Turturro's portrayal, you see the man he could have been, if only. It is Chekhovian in that way, or maybe Russian in that way. A kind of Vanya, but years younger before he became cynical. Luzhin, trying so hard not to lose sight of himself, can't see anybody else. He tries and he fails.</p> <p> Watching it you find yourself thinking that in other hands it could have been a great film. The definitive role for Turturro, a culmination of so much work that has gone before. The cowardice of Bernie. The egotism of Barton Fink. The kind of felt but never integrated physicality of his father in Mac. Plus a kind of modulated elegance, when he dances, when he is making love to Emily Watson, that I have never seen in Turturro before. </p> <p>All he has ever wanted of film, he says, is to be able to develop, not to repeat himself. Imperfection is his element, he learned it early on, and it is, to use one of his favourite words, his humanity. There was a time, he tells me, when he was young and so embarrassed by the size of his nose that he'd sit in class with his hand covering one side so that the beautiful girl on his left couldn't see it. \"A whole year I did that, maybe more.\" </p> <p>In Illuminata, he wrote these lines for the leading lady, played by his wife Katherine. \"I am imperfect... Born imperfect, educated imperfectly... moulded in my formative years by imperfect hands... If you look for someone to love you imperfectly, look no further.\"</p> <p>There's a lot of me in that, he had told me. There is a lot of all of us in that </p> <p>\u0095 The Luzhin Defence opens on September 8, O Brother, Where Art Thou? on September 15.</p>",

This kind of humiliation is Bernie Bernbaum pleading for his life, instead of taking the bullet like a man, as his macho world insists. But there's another kind of humiliation that is at the extreme end of embarrassment, in which you see yourself as you are seen. The ability to do this, to expose yourself at will and in public, is acting - anything else is simply playing at acting. Turturro has said that he learned everything he knows about acting from his father, who was an Italian immigrant construction worker. An honest guy, \"to a fault\", extremely physical, tough, and violent. He frightened his three sons. Turturro is the middle child: \"Always in the middle, always juggling, that's where I stand in life.\" And no doubt he frightened his wife. He used to hit her, \"not a lot, but it did happen\", and it was always John who intervened. \"For some reason my older brother was more afraid than I.\" His mother, he says, always knew \"I'd hit my father if he went too far\". So he grew up in Queens, in a house \"where you always had to be aware that something could happen because of his temper\". And that gave him an ability to read situations, to sense what was going on. \"It was a great house to grow up in if you wanted to be an actor. You lived moment to moment, there was a lot of black humour.\" They'd all play it carefully, \"follow my mother's lead, never come on to him\". And so he learned \"that if you do something to someone it has a repercussion\". This is what acting is about, he says. You do something and you follow it through to the next move and then the next - a bit like a game of chess - constantly alert to the new possibility. In bad actors, he says, you see this mistake all the time - \"They do something and you want to tell them, 'You can't do that and be so relaxed about it because you don't know what will happen, you haven't thought it out.' It's hard to explain this to someone who hasn't had my kind of experience.\" And yet he says he loved his father. \"We had a good relationship. I kind of understood him.\" He understood the brutality of his father's world, having no money and the powerlessness of that. How powerlessness leads to bullying. How no one is one thing. \"He could be very sensitive, too, and funny. He talked a lot and about everything.\" He taught him some good things - about passion, about loving work. \"He was never sloppy, never lazy.\" And about a kind of immersion, of personalising things. \"If my father was watching a movie, he was in that movie.\" After his father died of a heart attack Turturro found it very hard to get over the loss. \"The fact that you don't see that person again, that you can't have him again.\" His mother told him that even in his deathbed delirium he was talking about work back at the construction site, ordering people around, \"where he had been happy\". In 1989, soon after his death, Turturro wrote and directed a largely autobiographical film, Mac, based on his father and his childhood experience of his family, in which he played his father and which in 1992 won Best First Film Award at Cannes. He had originally written it as a play with Brandon Cole in 1980. He spent 12 years getting it to the screen. He didn't make it out of respect for his father - \"Not only that. It seemed to me you don't see films about people like this, no education, no privilege. There are a lot of worlds whose stories are never told. I didn't want to make a sentimental portrait of Italian home life. I wanted it warts and all.\" Watching it later, he was surprised \"at how uninhibited I was\". As a kid he took all the responsibility, \"just about all of it\", and that's continued into his adult life. \"I'd do anything I can to help. I have no qualms about being the one that can make things better - give them money, buy them something. I'll lie, be inventive if I have to, if there's something I can do for one of them. When they're okay, then I can do my stuff.\" His elder brother has had drug problems: \"He was always fragile. Probably he needed help when he was young and he didn't get it. By the time he did it was too late.\" His younger brother s an actor: \"He has a lot of talent, but I don't know if he's ever going to get out of himself all that he could.\" As he says, there are repercussions. He has never been a depressive, he says. \"I think you have to have a predisposition to that, and if I get blue I try to put it into something, incorporate it into something I am doing.\" He gets emotional. \"But emotion is not depressing.\" And he gets irritated - that some of what he considers to be his finest work has not been widely acclaimed; that a film such as Francesco Rosi's The Truce, in which he played Primo Levi - \"a great film from a great book written by one of the greatest writers about the Holocaust\" - got almost no audience compared with a film such as Life Is Beautiful. \"Of course it bothers me. That our wonderful, meditative, non histrionic film didn't do as well as it deserved. And you see a film like that and how successful it can be and it's just a fairy-tale. You'd think there could have been a place for something else, that people could have been moved by something that showed the other side of the fairy-tale. But that's how it is. That's the nature of the beast. I work here and it's a market place that's very adolescent.\" Time, anyway, he says, is the test of greatness. \"It took a long time for Levi to find a publisher for his book. I think The Truce will survive. Time will be good to it.\" He is an optimist, in his life, in his work, but also a pragmatist. He chooses carefully, the people around him. \"I don't like to be around people who are neurotic.\" And the people he works with. He has made four films with the Coens, who are great, he says. \"I have never been unhappy. They always ask me to do things they haven't seen me do, and anything I've done they have always made look better. That's a lot in movies. They wrote Barton Fink for me. What more can you ask? And as people they are kind, thoughtful, together, talented, not macho. If their films were half as good as they are I'd still want to work with them because of the kind of people they are.\" Ditto Spike Lee. Though he has some criticisms, of Jungle Fever in particular. \"My side story was so much stronger than the central character in that film. I think at one time he wanted to make it the main character, I think he would have... but he didn't.\" They are still good friends. \"He just hasn't had that much for me recently. You know, you work well with someone, you think you'll work together more. But then, no. That's how it is. When my friends have roles for me I am thrilled to do it. I love it.\" He has three films opening shortly: the Coens' O Brother, Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried, and Dutch director Marleen Gorris's The Luzhin Defence, from a Nabakov novella, in which he plays the lead. It is not his best film. \"There are a couple of things I am disappointed about, little things that didn't make it in.\" But, as he says, it's a hard book and hard to adapt - movies have to simplify. \"Favourite things go as you try to make it more understandable. Really, I have to see it a couple more times before I can say.\" In lots of ways I think he'll be pleased. There are all sorts of criticisms that can be made of the film as an adaptation. It has become a morality tale, in a way Nabakov never intended. It's far too explicit, the introduction of a demonic character, not in the book, over-simplifies. The ending is so compressed as to be unrecognisable. But it doesn't matter. Turturro is wonderful as Luzhin, a grand chess master who comes to the Italian lakes to play the tournament of his life and falls in love. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role, except maybe Pacino before he played The Godfather. So, impossible, in other words. Nabakov wrote it as the story of a man who can't get outside his own head. Chess, the only thing he knows how to do, and consequently the only thing he loves, will kill him, and yet he can't survive without it. \"I have seen that with people I have known and it is a tragedy.\" In Turturro's portrayal, you see the man he could have been, if only. It is Chekhovian in that way, or maybe Russian in that way. A kind of Vanya, but years younger before he became cynical. Luzhin, trying so hard not to lose sight of himself, can't see anybody else. He tries and he fails. Watching it you find yourself thinking that in other hands it could have been a great film. The definitive role for Turturro, a culmination of so much work that has gone before. The cowardice of Bernie. The egotism of Barton Fink. The kind of felt but never integrated physicality of his father in Mac. Plus a kind of modulated elegance, when he dances, when he is making love to Emily Watson, that I have never seen in Turturro before. All he has ever wanted of film, he says, is to be able to develop, not to repeat himself. Imperfection is his element, he learned it early on, and it is, to use one of his favourite words, his humanity. There was a time, he tells me, when he was young and so embarrassed by the size of his nose that he'd sit in class with his hand covering one side so that the beautiful girl on his left couldn't see it. \"A whole year I did that, maybe more.\" In Illuminata, he wrote these lines for the leading lady, played by his wife Katherine. \"I am imperfect... Born imperfect, educated imperfectly... moulded in my formative years by imperfect hands... If you look for someone to love you imperfectly, look no further.\" There's a lot of me in that, he had told me. There is a lot of all of us in that \u0095 The Luzhin Defence opens on September 8, O Brother, Where Art Thou? on September 15.",

In chronological order, these are the cases he cites: </p> <p>Jean Baptiste Lully (1687) used to conduct by stamping a staff on the floor. One day, no doubt while trying to inspire a crescendo, he put the staff through his foot and died of the subsequent gangrene. </p> <p>Johann Schobert (1767; not to be confused with the rather more eminent Schubert) died with his household after eating poisonous fungi.

In a book called Famous Last Words, compiled by Jonathon Green, it is stated that Peacock was burned to death while trying to save his library from a fire. His last words are said to have been: \"By the immortal God, I will not move.\" A friend has lent me a life of Peacock by JB Priestley - not your obvious Peacockophile: too dour: but his book is deeply enjoyable - which does not quite confirm this story. According to Priestley, Peacock, then 80 and something of a recluse, had a morbid fear of fire, and did indeed utter this cry of defiance when a fire duly occurred. But these would not have been his last words; he survived the fire - only to fall into a fatal decline. </p> <p> \u0095 And what (you must surely be asking by now) about the death of Alexander Zemlinsky? Apart from the date (1942), Grove has nothing to tell us here. But what's clear about Zemlinsky, as Dr RF Carter of Putney points out (what a great week for Carters! I hope to hear more from more Carters in future) is that he is always being traduced. Traduced, that is, if you call it traduction to be assigned to the second Viennese school by people who seem think that it practised relentless cacophony. Dr Carter singles out for especial disdain a columnist in the Observer who suggested that Zemlinsky was unlikely to figure on Vladimir Putin's list for Desert Island Discs - thus implying (Dr Carter suggests) that Zemlinsky was a) a blight on the ear and b) Russian rather than Austrian. Knowing nothing of Zemlinsky, I borrowed a disc from the record library and can now confirm Dr Carter's view that his music is no more rebarbative than, say, Mahler's. The work I heard was quite Brahmsy and pretty Wagnery. He may have been Schoenberg's father-in-law but demanding he certainly wasn't; if anything, a bit on the soppy side.</p> <p> <strong> A pedant writes: </strong> There is no such word as traduction. I think what you mean is traducement.</p> <p><strong> Smallweed responds with a lascivious sneer: </strong> If it's all the same to you, old fruit, I think I shall stick to traduction. When you were last seduced, did you not call it seduction? </p> <p>\u0095 The final test of the England-West Indies series may be over by now, so perhaps it is time for a word on the much-praised Channel 4 coverage - so much better, people keep saying, than the lazy old BBC's. Smallweed cannot entirely agree. I like some innovations, especially Simon Hughes's subtle analyses from his dungeon. But I find the sudden switches from cricket to ads unsettling. A generation is growing up which will come to think of cricket as a game in which, as soon as a bowler has bowled his sixth ball, someone tries to sell you a Renault. </p> <p>\u0095 Someone has pinned on a noticeboard not far from Smallweed's head a cutting torn from something called The Sinderwood Stroll, by Bob Footslog (maybe a pseudonym?): \"Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Every day I walk myself into a state of wellbeing, and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my very best thoughts, and I know of no walk so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it; but sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill - thus if one just keeps walking, everything will be all right.\" That is Kierkegaard. I shall ponder it in a moment or two as I stroll the length of the Balls Pond Road to the point where it meets the A10 at Dalston. It's suggested that one of the ancients - it's not clear which one, but no doubt some Carter or Carters will know the answer - summed it up rather better in the words: solvitur ambulando. But that's hardly enough to keep one going all the way down the Balls Pond Road. </p> <p>\u0095 More unfinished business. The allegation that \"step change\" derives from the practice of marching armies has been challenged on various counts. It relates to the thrills and spills of the world of accountancy, having to do - according to a correspondent clearly well versed in these matters - with the way costs are laid out in graphs as production increases. And the alias under which TE Lawrence signed up for the RAF under the watchful eye of the creator of Biggles was Ross, not Shaw: he changed to Shaw later, having been rumbled. And how did he die, you may ask? In a motorcycle accident.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"mailto:smallweed@theguardian.com\">smallweed@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Smallweed cannot entirely agree. I like some innovations, especially Simon Hughes's subtle analyses from his dungeon. But I find the sudden switches from cricket to ads unsettling. A generation is growing up which will come to think of cricket as a game in which, as soon as a bowler has bowled his sixth ball, someone tries to sell you a Renault. \u0095 Someone has pinned on a noticeboard not far from Smallweed's head a cutting torn from something called The Sinderwood Stroll, by Bob Footslog (maybe a pseudonym?): \"Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Every day I walk myself into a state of wellbeing, and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my very best thoughts, and I know of no walk so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it; but sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill - thus if one just keeps walking, everything will be all right.\" That is Kierkegaard. I shall ponder it in a moment or two as I stroll the length of the Balls Pond Road to the point where it meets the A10 at Dalston. It's suggested that one of the ancients - it's not clear which one, but no doubt some Carter or Carters will know the answer - summed it up rather better in the words: solvitur ambulando. But that's hardly enough to keep one going all the way down the Balls Pond Road. \u0095 More unfinished business. The allegation that \"step change\" derives from the practice of marching armies has been challenged on various counts. It relates to the thrills and spills of the world of accountancy, having to do - according to a correspondent clearly well versed in these matters - with the way costs are laid out in graphs as production increases. And the alias under which TE Lawrence signed up for the RAF under the watchful eye of the creator of Biggles was Ross, not Shaw: he changed to Shaw later, having been rumbled. And how did he die, you may ask? In a motorcycle accident. \u0095 smallweed@theguardian.com",

Even the most awkward volunteer seems to fit into place, turning a simple idea into pure magic. No hint of embarrassment or exploitation, just sheer pleasure, elicited by the performers with polite panache. And when a little old lady in a cream cardie is left onstage in solo triumph, the audience cheer as if they were in the presence of a star. </p> <p>This week the Edinburgh international festival showcased Netherlands Dans Theater in all their configurations. The audience participation came on Tuesday night, when NDT2, a group of 14 classically trained 18- to 22-year-olds, took to the Edinburgh Festival Theatre. Strong and showy, they display an irrepressible enthusiasm. Minus 16, a compilation of the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin's work, slots the audience-participation gem into other, unconnected fragments of his oeuvre - an Israeli chant on a circle of chairs, a walk with the dancers that includes a chat and cute solo from each. Naharin's casually dynamic language allows the group to release its youthful energy. </p> <p>The evening was shared by NDT3, a quartet of fortysomething dancers. Inspired by the strings of Vivaldi's Human Passions, choreo grapher and company member Paul Lightfoot takes a softly, softly approach to his performers. Though gracefully executed, the result looks tired, old-fashioned and coy. To gather up these dancers and present them as under-powered oldies negates their dramatic and interpretative abilities. </p> <p>On Wednesday NDT1, the main company, took the bigger stage at the Edinburgh Playhouse, accompanied by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. They opened romantically, with a piece about belonging, Forgotten Land, choreographed by Jiri Kylian, who has steered NDT to international success over the past two decades. Made in 1981, it is set to Benjamin Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem, a score with a heartbeat, an affirmation of life that the composer wrote in response to the deaths of his parents. </p> <p>The dancers begin with their backs to the audience, walking in the wind. As the music builds, each couple is framed in close, protective duets, leaning, crouching, winding. They rarely leave each other's side. Britten's score rises in the centre and leads the pair in red to race against the music. </p> <p>A lyrical choreographer with a tendency to avoid invention, Kylian likes his dancers to fly a lot, and they do it powerfully well. Choreographer Paul Lightfoot prefers to root them to the ground. In Speak for Yourself, first performed last year, he brings on the boys and accentuates male muscle. They are the young Athenians - angled, carved and bendy bodies. </p> <p>This is a sombre piece, which begins with smoke and ends in the rain. Humour has been given a bodyswerve and the dancers remain cool and measured. Something is missing, however: as novel as it is to see a company splashing about in puddles, Light foot's choreography does not reflect the dramatic change from dry to wet sufficiently to push this piece from good to gripping. </p> <p>The evening at the Playhouse ends with Sinfonietta, again choreographed by Kylian. Made in 1978, it is a soaring response to Janacek's music of the same name, backed with blue light and dressed in floaty silk. Once more Kylian's dancers put on their wings, but on this occasion it is the score and orchestra that are the stars. Pulled out of the pit, the brass and percussion are up among us in the boxes. Eyes are drawn to them and their rousing fanfare, and the dance, exuberant though it is, becomes the accompaniment. </p> <p>NDT are never less than immaculate.

Fix my tie, will you?\" </p> <p>Not that The Bill is bad. It's actually all right, if you like that sort of thing. This week there was a touchy-feely story centred around the barely pubescent PC Dale Smith. He befriended Tim, a young Chinese lad whose parents had mysteriously vanished while being chased by Bad Men. The Bad Men, actually money launderers, finally caught up with Smith and Tim, and were ready to snatch Tim, before Smith handcuffed himself to the lad so he had to be kidnapped too.

Mysterious goings-on in a remote Northumberland village began with Tom McCabe rescuing a shop dummy from the sea and ended with him returning to his girlfriend, who had earlier confessed to sleeping with another bloke again. There was a faint hope he might meet with a Wicker Man situation but, alas, that was not to be. Instead - and arguably just as awful as being burned alive with goats and chickens - he met Maaaahy Flaaaaherty from EastEnders labouring in a pub, grieved over a dead seal (the only good kind apparently, but that was according to another Bad Man) and used his binoculars correctly. The last not easy for a man as thick as McCabe. </p> <p>The shop dummy, the old beachcomber and the pub landlord were all mixed up in smuggling cigarettes, you see, and Frank (another Bad Man) wanted them to graduate to importing \"stuff from Holland\". Not rubbery cheese, as I first thought, but dope actually. Positively Evil Men. Tsk. Hurray for Badger. </p> <p>Phill Jupitus was on Room 101 (BBC2), confessing to being quite a misanthrope, not to mention an arachnophobe and someone who dislikes extended warranties on electrical goods. While Jupitus was a good guest and Paul Merton is a capable host, there is something so tired and banal about Room 101 that really you feel it should only be on for about 10 minutes, maybe before Newsnight. Or better still, after Newsnight. Actually, around three in the morning would be ideal. </p> <p>It's nice to see Tony Hart back on telly - Smart Hart (BBC1) - even if he never put any of the countless drawings I sent in into the Gallery.</p>",

The shop dummy, the old beachcomber and the pub landlord were all mixed up in smuggling cigarettes, you see, and Frank (another Bad Man) wanted them to graduate to importing \"stuff from Holland\". Not rubbery cheese, as I first thought, but dope actually. Positively Evil Men. Tsk. Hurray for Badger. Phill Jupitus was on Room 101 (BBC2), confessing to being quite a misanthrope, not to mention an arachnophobe and someone who dislikes extended warranties on electrical goods. While Jupitus was a good guest and Paul Merton is a capable host, there is something so tired and banal about Room 101 that really you feel it should only be on for about 10 minutes, maybe before Newsnight. Or better still, after Newsnight. Actually, around three in the morning would be ideal. It's nice to see Tony Hart back on telly - Smart Hart (BBC1) - even if he never put any of the countless drawings I sent in into the Gallery.",

But the top priority for the next five years is the construction problem. That means the general director will be the boss and the artistic director will be his subordinate.\" </p> <p>The 1990s were not kind to the Bolshoi, its decline made that much harder to bear by the rise to global acclaim of its great rival, St Petersburg's Mariinsky/Kirov opera and ballet under the mercurial Valery Gergiev. </p> <p>\"The Bolshoi can no longer compete with the Royal Opera House or the New York Metropolitan or Vienna,\" says Larisa Dolgacheva, opera critic for the Kultura arts journal. \"It's such a sad situation - mediocre directors, boring scenography.\" Vasilyev, a revered former dancer who turned 60 this year, has had more misses than hits in his five years in charge, according to the Moscow critics. \"He affects the air of a Chekhovian intellectual, a dreamer who can't cope with the world. He's taken the Bolshoi to a dead end,\" says Ms Dolgacheva. </p> <p>The appointment of Rozhdestvensky would restore the Bolshoi tradition of having a musician and conductor as the artistic chief of the 263-strong corps de ballet, 107-strong opera company, 281 orchestra players, and chorus of 196. But the conductor, who made his Bolshoi debut almost 40 years ago, appears to be playing hard to get. Shvydkoi confirmed yesterday he had offered him the post. Rozhdestvensky made it plain he would drive a hard bargain and would not make up his mind until today's crucial meeting. </p> <p>If Gergiev in St Petersburg is a dynamic 47 and a top name in international conducting, Rozhdestvensky is 69 and some wonder if he is the man to turn the Bolshoi's fortunes around. </p> <p>\"He's a huge talent, an outstanding musician with an extraordinary musical memory,\" says a Moscow violinist who has known him for 20 years and worked with him frequently. \"But he doesn't like staying in one place for long. He gets bored and he can't stand long rehearsals with orchestras. What the Bolshoi really needs is a musical and artistic leader for at least five years to raise the level of the orchestra and of performance.\" </p> <p>Art apart, the Kremlin is making it plain that the reconstruction project is the priority. According to the Putin decrees, the company will move into a secondary theatre to be built by January 2002 so that the main theatre can be restored and rebuilt by 2005. The Soviet government ordered the reconstruction in 1987 but work ground to a halt although \u00a380m had already been spent. The reconstruction is expected to cost \u00a3270m, though there is scant detail on where the money is coming from. </p> <p>The job of overseeing the project falls to Iksanov, a respected if little-known arts administrator who managed a theatre in St Petersburg and currently runs the state arts TV channel, Kultura, a post previously held by Shvydkoi. </p> <p>Under the new broom in the Kremlin, Shvydkoi is building himself an arts empire. Earlier this year he performed the same trick with the Russian film industry, subordinating the state cinema board to his ministry. Some say the sumptuous museums and collections of the Kremlin are next in line. </p> <p>The new Bolshoi season opens in two weeks in time-honoured fashion with a Glinka opera followed by Swan Lake the next evening. \"It's such a remarkable theatre,\" says Ms Kabakhidze. \"But it's in big danger and we don't want to lose it.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Scratch the shiny surface of the internet and you will find a vast electronic mail-order catalogue. It was inevitable that the purveyors of interior decor would converge on the the new medium, and the internet is now teeming with sites that cater to home shoppers, to decorators and to those of us who simply wish to drool over objects of domestic desire without having to traipse down to the high street. Some of the new sites may well be the Heals and Habitats of the future; others may not be with us in a year's time. But it is now possible to furnish your home just by logging on. </p> <p>One of the smoothest sites comes from a company called Interior Internet, a branded electronic megamart of interior design that is what one might call lifestyle- rather than design-led, with a range of thematic search options - among them are \"Nutopia\" (futuristic retro), Loft Living, Fantasy, \"Chic-and-Bleak\" - along with a more functional category search, so that browsers can click on lighting, tables, ashtrays even. </p> <p>But hang on - isn't this the one retail sector where it is essential to touch and even bounce on your bed or chair to be? \"Actually, that hasn't been much of an issue,\" explains Interior Internet's Alistair Taylor. \"The traffic we get isn't really looking for comfortable, bouncy sofas. But we send samples if we can [sofas not included], and if there's a problem when the object arrives, we have a returns policy.\" And the trade - much of their business comes from interior designers and architects - has already proved itself to be happy to work \"with imagery rather than the physical objects\". </p> <p>Taylor set up Interior Internet with fellow fashion graduate Johnston Campbell, and they are typical of the e-generation - twentysomethings who had an idea, got financial backing and went on-line four years ago. They have been online for six months. Theirs is a shell operation: that is, it holds no stock and ships items direct from suppliers and manufacturers, so there is no need for a storeroom or fancy shop, just a bit of soft-modern multimedia design on the site. And there is no shoplifting. </p> <p>As with the other interiors sites, the goods are represented by thumbnail photographs that can be enlarged at a lick of the mouse. Some items can even be viewed from different angles. You can also read about what's available: the site currently features an article about Italian designer Piero Fornasetti, whose designs itsells. ut the central point is to shift the 30,000 items on sale, which include work by Nicolas Haslam, Andrew Martin, Mark Brazier-Jones and Habitat's Tom Dixon. Some pieces are one-offs, others commissions. </p> <p>It is a fairly eclectic site, which reflects Taylor and Campbell's tastes. \"People seem to think that the internet suggests that we will sell only contemporary things,\" says Taylor. \"But in the loft-living section, there might be an 18th-century bureau. That's what is interesting about decorating - being able to make it gel.\" </p> <p>Indeed, Taylor's own north London flat resists the pared-down technological aesthetic, preferring a riot of rococo, rendered in bright colours. He has an ochre living room, a deep-red bedroom, a turquoise spare room and a blue hallway. Walls are dressed with colourful finds, such as a mounted display of Brazilian butterflies, and the look could fit into his site's \"fantasy\" category. </p> <p>Some new sites are connoisseur-led, selling provenanced pieces as if artworks, but Taylor is not too bothered with that, professionally or personally: in the middle of his living room is a huge repro chandelier, and the bust overlooking his bed is plaster, not marble. </p> <p>Amid all this opulence are touches of surrealism. A series of 14 Salvador Dal\u00ed prints is arranged in two rows along a wall - \"architectural images of the female form\", as Taylor puts it. He also has pieces by Fornasetti, the results of auction-picking, and plenty of south-east Asian furnishings, gleaned from various travels. </p> <p>Eatmyhandbagbitch.com, on the other hand, is a website title of extravagant camp aggression (particularly when growled by way of phone greeting), and its portal is designed in a pink retro-pop style. Georgina Stead, who runs the site and its parent shop with her partner, George Enoch, explains that the name comes from a work of art that Enoch made several years ago \"Most modern furniture shops and sites tend to have graphicky pencil images and names that include the words \"20th\" \"century\" and \"design\", explains Stead. \"We wanted to be a bit different.\" </p> <p>Stead used to work at a bank and Enoch was, and remains, an artist: such collusions between finance and creativity are common in dot.com circles. They did their apprenticeships on market stalls in Camden and Spitalfields, before moving to Brick Lane, which is now such a dot.com centre that some have dubbed it \"Click\" Lane. They set up the site six months ago, purely as an adjunct to the shop, but it ow turns around 90% of their business. \"It's a full-time job to monitor it,\" says Stead. </p> <p>On the site are thumbnails of modern antiques by designers from the fifties - Italian Joe Colombo, mid-century Finnish wizard Eero Saarinen and contemporary British designer Ross Lovegrove. It is a mixture, says Stead, of \"futuristic and modern\" and is divided into regional and stylistic tendencies - a rather more academic and design-savvy approach than the glitzy graphics suggest. \"It's not the sort of kitsch that you'd find on some market stalls,\" she says. \"We are concerned with good design.\" </p> <p>There are those who use the internet simply as they would a leaflet: modern furniture dealer Graham Manchais among them. He runs his site as a cottage industry, photographing, scanning, selling and delivering on his own. Mancha does not have much time for the futuristic hyperbole that surrounds the internet, but was an \"early adopter\" of the medium, and has maintained an internet presence for the past six years. </p> <p>\"Back then, hardly anyone in Britain was on the internet,\" he says. \"I only did it because my service provider gave free web space. It was a happy accident.\" </p> <p>Mancha testifies to the internet's global reach: when he started the site, he was surprised to receive calls within days of the launch from people in the US who wanted to buy his postwar modern furniture. In fact, Graham Mancha is the classic example of just how the internet can empower small traders. He doesn't monitor the site - which costs him just \u00a310 a month to maintain - and he works from home (in Bedfordshire), which is the perfect way to keep down all those overheads.</p> <p><strong> Log on, bliss out </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.banaldesign.com\">www.banaldesign.com</a><br> Connoisseur US site selling antiques from the 80s and 90s. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bluedeco.com\">www.bluedeco.com</a><br> Intelligent site selling contemporary work by young designers. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chiasmus.co.uk\">www.chiasmus.co.uk</a><br> A fun attitude pervades this 'fresh and funky' site.

      "bodyText": "Scratch the shiny surface of the internet and you will find a vast electronic mail-order catalogue. It was inevitable that the purveyors of interior decor would converge on the the new medium, and the internet is now teeming with sites that cater to home shoppers, to decorators and to those of us who simply wish to drool over objects of domestic desire without having to traipse down to the high street. Some of the new sites may well be the Heals and Habitats of the future; others may not be with us in a year's time. But it is now possible to furnish your home just by logging on. One of the smoothest sites comes from a company called Interior Internet, a branded electronic megamart of interior design that is what one might call lifestyle- rather than design-led, with a range of thematic search options - among them are \"Nutopia\" (futuristic retro), Loft Living, Fantasy, \"Chic-and-Bleak\" - along with a more functional category search, so that browsers can click on lighting, tables, ashtrays even. But hang on - isn't this the one retail sector where it is essential to touch and even bounce on your bed or chair to be? \"Actually, that hasn't been much of an issue,\" explains Interior Internet's Alistair Taylor. \"The traffic we get isn't really looking for comfortable, bouncy sofas. But we send samples if we can [sofas not included], and if there's a problem when the object arrives, we have a returns policy.\" And the trade - much of their business comes from interior designers and architects - has already proved itself to be happy to work \"with imagery rather than the physical objects\". Taylor set up Interior Internet with fellow fashion graduate Johnston Campbell, and they are typical of the e-generation - twentysomethings who had an idea, got financial backing and went on-line four years ago. They have been online for six months. Theirs is a shell operation: that is, it holds no stock and ships items direct from suppliers and manufacturers, so there is no need for a storeroom or fancy shop, just a bit of soft-modern multimedia design on the site. And there is no shoplifting. As with the other interiors sites, the goods are represented by thumbnail photographs that can be enlarged at a lick of the mouse. Some items can even be viewed from different angles. You can also read about what's available: the site currently features an article about Italian designer Piero Fornasetti, whose designs itsells. ut the central point is to shift the 30,000 items on sale, which include work by Nicolas Haslam, Andrew Martin, Mark Brazier-Jones and Habitat's Tom Dixon. Some pieces are one-offs, others commissions. It is a fairly eclectic site, which reflects Taylor and Campbell's tastes. \"People seem to think that the internet suggests that we will sell only contemporary things,\" says Taylor. \"But in the loft-living section, there might be an 18th-century bureau. That's what is interesting about decorating - being able to make it gel.\" Indeed, Taylor's own north London flat resists the pared-down technological aesthetic, preferring a riot of rococo, rendered in bright colours. He has an ochre living room, a deep-red bedroom, a turquoise spare room and a blue hallway. Walls are dressed with colourful finds, such as a mounted display of Brazilian butterflies, and the look could fit into his site's \"fantasy\" category. Some new sites are connoisseur-led, selling provenanced pieces as if artworks, but Taylor is not too bothered with that, professionally or personally: in the middle of his living room is a huge repro chandelier, and the bust overlooking his bed is plaster, not marble. Amid all this opulence are touches of surrealism. A series of 14 Salvador Dal\u00ed prints is arranged in two rows along a wall - \"architectural images of the female form\", as Taylor puts it. He also has pieces by Fornasetti, the results of auction-picking, and plenty of south-east Asian furnishings, gleaned from various travels. Eatmyhandbagbitch.com, on the other hand, is a website title of extravagant camp aggression (particularly when growled by way of phone greeting), and its portal is designed in a pink retro-pop style. Georgina Stead, who runs the site and its parent shop with her partner, George Enoch, explains that the name comes from a work of art that Enoch made several years ago \"Most modern furniture shops and sites tend to have graphicky pencil images and names that include the words \"20th\" \"century\" and \"design\", explains Stead. \"We wanted to be a bit different.\" Stead used to work at a bank and Enoch was, and remains, an artist: such collusions between finance and creativity are common in dot.com circles. They did their apprenticeships on market stalls in Camden and Spitalfields, before moving to Brick Lane, which is now such a dot.com centre that some have dubbed it \"Click\" Lane. They set up the site six months ago, purely as an adjunct to the shop, but it ow turns around 90% of their business. \"It's a full-time job to monitor it,\" says Stead. On the site are thumbnails of modern antiques by designers from the fifties - Italian Joe Colombo, mid-century Finnish wizard Eero Saarinen and contemporary British designer Ross Lovegrove. It is a mixture, says Stead, of \"futuristic and modern\" and is divided into regional and stylistic tendencies - a rather more academic and design-savvy approach than the glitzy graphics suggest. \"It's not the sort of kitsch that you'd find on some market stalls,\" she says. \"We are concerned with good design.\" There are those who use the internet simply as they would a leaflet: modern furniture dealer Graham Manchais among them. He runs his site as a cottage industry, photographing, scanning, selling and delivering on his own. Mancha does not have much time for the futuristic hyperbole that surrounds the internet, but was an \"early adopter\" of the medium, and has maintained an internet presence for the past six years. \"Back then, hardly anyone in Britain was on the internet,\" he says. \"I only did it because my service provider gave free web space. It was a happy accident.\" Mancha testifies to the internet's global reach: when he started the site, he was surprised to receive calls within days of the launch from people in the US who wanted to buy his postwar modern furniture. In fact, Graham Mancha is the classic example of just how the internet can empower small traders. He doesn't monitor the site - which costs him just \u00a310 a month to maintain - and he works from home (in Bedfordshire), which is the perfect way to keep down all those overheads.

Despite being a personal finance journalist who should, arguably, know better, I'd therefore taken little notice of reports on how best to invest it. </p> <p>So, when to my delight a cheque arrived for nearly \u00a35,000, I asked several independent financial advisers (IFAs) how people like me, who have never been in the wealth bracket to seriously invest in equities, could make use of such unexpected windfalls to start building diversified stockmarket-based portfolios. </p> <p>The aim for most novice investors would be to salt the money away over the medium term - for at least five to 10 years - to achieve capital growth. And opting for pooled funds like unit trust or investment trusts, where your money is put together with that of others and invested across a wide range of stocks, is a safer strategy than investing direct in individual shares. But which funds should one start with and should you be splitting a sum like \u00a35,000 between different funds? </p> <p>Mark Bolland, technical director of IFA Chamberlain de Broe says: \"Over the medium to long term, it makes sense to stash your money away in a tax-efficient environment. So, if you haven't already got one, invest via a tax-free Isa [individual savings account] and find a provider that offers a good range of funds like Gartmore or Henderson. </p> <p>\"Start by building up your UK and European exposure so you could, for example, split your \u00a35,000 and put 75% in Gartmore's UK Growth Fund and 25% in its European Selected Opportunities fund.\" </p> <p>An option for investors who haven't the time or inclination to think about the global asset allocation of their portfolio is to invest the whole lump sum in a large, international investment trust and leave diversification up to the fund manager. \"I'd go for Alliance Trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial or Henderson Investors' Witan trust which are all very good, broadly spread funds,\" he says. </p> <p>Witan is also the top recommendation of Patrick Connolly at IFA Chartwell Investment Management for novice investors. \"This low-risk trust will give you a ready-made diversified portfolio in one fund,\" he says. \"It combines the individual expertise of different Henderson fund managers who all contribute to this one umbrella fund which also has very low charges.\" </p> <p>Like Mr Bolland, Gavin Haynes, investment director of IFA Whitechurch Securities, favours the UK as the first building block of a diversified portfolio. \"The advantages are that there are no currency risks in UK and you are likely to be familiar with the underlying companies that UK funds are investing in,\" says Mr Haynes. </p> <p>He recommends a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale unit trust Isa with \u00a35,000 split three ways with \u00a32,000 in its UK Growth, \u00a32,000 in its European Growth and \u00a31,000 in its Technology trust to add, \"a bit of aggression\". </p> <p>An alternative would be an Aberdeen Unit Trust Managers Isa with its UK Blue Chip fund as the core holding plus some money in its Technology trust. </p> <p>International investments should be the next step to building a diversified portfolio says Mr Haynes who favours the EquiSar unit trusts from Sarasin Investment Management which offers, \"a good international spread of blue chip companies chosen on a thematic \"best of sector\" basis\". </p> <p>Dan Kemp of IFA Holden Meehan takes a different approach in recommending that new investors start with international funds, adding other sector and country funds, including the UK, as their portfolio grows. </p> <p>\"First, make use of your Isa allowance, topping up any Isa you've already started to the maximum of \u00a37,000. Remember you can use a new fund , though it must come from the same Isa provider. Then, as a core holding, I'd go for Fidelity's International unit trust or Mercury's Global Titans before building up European exposure using Gartmore European Selected Opportunities.\" </p> <p>For investors who want only ethical investments, a sector in which Holden Meehan specialises, Mr Kemp recommends two unit trusts, Murray Johnstone's Ethical World and Jupiter's Ecology. </p> <p><strong>Will this windfall raise your tax bill?</strong></p> <p>For thousands of Scottish Widows policyholders, joy over the size of their windfalls has been marred by the potential problem of an unexpected capital gains tax liability. </p> <p>Patrick Connolly, at IFA Chartwell Investment Management, says the firm has been contacted by clients expecting windfalls under \u00a37,200 - the current annual CGT per person allowance - who have actually received lump sums of \u00a310,000-\u00a312,000. </p> <p>A higher rate 40% taxpayer receiving \u00a312,200, for example, who has no further capital gains in the tax year faces a CGT liability of almost \u00a32,000. Even basic rate taxpayers could end up paying 40p in the pound if their windfall tips their total earnings into top rate tax territory - although sums paid directly into pension schemes do not attract the tax. </p> <p>These gains must be declared on tax returns for the year 2000-01, so funds must be available to pay the tax bill in January 2002. </p> <p>But there are ways of possibly lessening the CGT blow. Investors should first review their existing portfolios to see if they have any capital losses they can offset. \"But, if you choose this option, it may be sensible to take independent advice as it may not prove wise to sell a particular investment simply because it is standing at a loss,\" Mr Connolly says. </p> <p>The alternative is to invest in vehicles like Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) and Enterprise Investment Schemes (EISs) which allow CGT liabilities to be deferred and often, with careful planning, avoided entirely. </p> <p>The downside of VCTs and EISs is that they are generally viewed as high risk investments. </p> <p>Dan Kemp, of IFA Holden Meehan, suggests those facing a CGT bill might also take advice on whether they could get the full benefit of their windfall by investing part of it in a pension. </p> <p>A free information pack for Scottish Widows policyholders with a CGT liability is available from Chartwell on 01225 321710.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Housing market slowdown - what housing market slowdown? That will doubtless be the reaction of many people on reading the latest official house price data from the Land Registry, which seems to contradict recent reports that the housing boom is over and prices are starting to fall. </p> <p>The Land Registry, a government department, this week issued its figures for the period April 1 to June 30 which show that the price of the average home in England and Wales has crashed through the \u00a3100,000 barrier for the first time ever. </p> <p>The typical property has increased in value by 14.5% over the last year, and is now worth \u00a3103,115. The annual rate of growth in Greater London is a lot higher - 23.3% - though there are a number of places that have outperformed the capital, from Somerset in the south to York in the north. </p> <p>Only a small handful of locations have seen small price falls over the last year, including: Kingston-upon-Hull, Middlesbrough, the north-east Lincolnshire area, Wrexham and Torfaen, south-east Wales. </p> <p>The figures will cheer homeowners but won't please would-be buyers currently pounding the streets. However, beneath the headline figures can be found signs that the market is indeed slowing. The 14.5% annual rate of growth is down on the record 16.8% annual rate notched up earlier this year, and the figures show prices in some of the most exclusive parts of London appear to be plateauing out. </p> <p>It is also important to bear in mind that the latest Land Registry figures only relate to house sales completed in the three months to June 30, so they are arguably almost two months out of date. According to Nationwide building society, the cost of an average UK home fell 0.2% in July and now stands at \u00a381,133. </p> <p>And new figures from the TEAM network of independent estate agents reveal that five out of the 16 locations they surveyed - Devon, Essex, Scotland, Somerset and Avon, and Wessex - saw slight price falls in August. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the Land Registry figures are the most comprehensive available because they include the vast majority of all house sales over the period, and are broken down by county, borough or unitary authority, and also into property types. </p> <p>They show that while the average home now costs \u00a3103,115, this figure hides a wealth of regional variations.

      "bodyText": "Housing market slowdown - what housing market slowdown? That will doubtless be the reaction of many people on reading the latest official house price data from the Land Registry, which seems to contradict recent reports that the housing boom is over and prices are starting to fall. The Land Registry, a government department, this week issued its figures for the period April 1 to June 30 which show that the price of the average home in England and Wales has crashed through the \u00a3100,000 barrier for the first time ever. The typical property has increased in value by 14.5% over the last year, and is now worth \u00a3103,115. The annual rate of growth in Greater London is a lot higher - 23.3% - though there are a number of places that have outperformed the capital, from Somerset in the south to York in the north. Only a small handful of locations have seen small price falls over the last year, including: Kingston-upon-Hull, Middlesbrough, the north-east Lincolnshire area, Wrexham and Torfaen, south-east Wales. The figures will cheer homeowners but won't please would-be buyers currently pounding the streets. However, beneath the headline figures can be found signs that the market is indeed slowing. The 14.5% annual rate of growth is down on the record 16.8% annual rate notched up earlier this year, and the figures show prices in some of the most exclusive parts of London appear to be plateauing out. It is also important to bear in mind that the latest Land Registry figures only relate to house sales completed in the three months to June 30, so they are arguably almost two months out of date. According to Nationwide building society, the cost of an average UK home fell 0.2% in July and now stands at \u00a381,133. And new figures from the TEAM network of independent estate agents reveal that five out of the 16 locations they surveyed - Devon, Essex, Scotland, Somerset and Avon, and Wessex - saw slight price falls in August. Nevertheless, the Land Registry figures are the most comprehensive available because they include the vast majority of all house sales over the period, and are broken down by county, borough or unitary authority, and also into property types. They show that while the average home now costs \u00a3103,115, this figure hides a wealth of regional variations. For example, in Stoke-on-Trent an average terraced home costs \u00a325,755, while in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea a typical terrace will set you back \u00a31.24m - 48 times as much. Predictably, Greater London tops the regional table, with an average property price of \u00a3177,182 (up 23.3% on a year earlier, when it was \u00a3143,725).

      "body": "<p>Like any victim of this humiliating process Mr Blacker would, if he chose to pursue the matter, be entitled to substantial compensation. </p> <p>He walked into the Somerfield store in Diss carrying newspapers that he had just purchased from a nearby newsagent. After paying for the groceries he was buying from the store he was accosted by two uniformed employees who accused him of stealing the newspapers. </p> <p>They claimed to have video evidence to support their accusation and made it clear that they would not allow him to leave the store. When they all looked at the video it turned out to feature someone who was clearly not Mr Blacker. </p> <p>Instead of releasing him after seeing this, the staff continued to detain him. The police were called. A policewoman did then make inquiries at the newsagents and he was released. </p> <p>Only after he wrote about the incident in a national newspaper did Somerfield even send a letter of apology. The company has not, though, offered any compensation. Indeed, the store has suggested that being involved in incidents like this is a price that people should be willing to pay to help support the fight against shoplifting. </p> <p>That, though, is not the view the law takes. Any one making a \"citizen's arrest\", which is what Somerfield did, has to get it absolutely right. Even making a reasonable mistake about someone's guilt does not provide an excuse if a person is wrongly arrested - or falsely imprisoned, as it is legally known. </p> <p>In 1912 the wife of the manager of WH Smiths at Kings Cross, John Walters, was found to be selling newspapers from her own newsstand in Staines that had been taken from that branch of WH Smiths without payment. </p> <p>The company's management arrested Walters at work. At trial the jury accepted he was not guilty of theft as he had intended paying for the newspapers. </p> <p>This meant that no criminal offence had been committed and that the arrest was wrongful. A civil court subsequently awarded him \u00a375 compensation, a sum equivalent to nearly \u00a35,000 in today's values. </p> <p>While that is perhaps more than Blacker would receive if he sued Somerfield, the level of damages in such cases - usually assessed by a civil jury - tend to be generous compared with those awarded to, say, accident victims. </p> <p>In a much worse case than Walters' or Blackers', Steven Smith was last year awarded a total of \u00a331,500 against the West Sussex police.

      "bodyText": "Like any victim of this humiliating process Mr Blacker would, if he chose to pursue the matter, be entitled to substantial compensation. He walked into the Somerfield store in Diss carrying newspapers that he had just purchased from a nearby newsagent. After paying for the groceries he was buying from the store he was accosted by two uniformed employees who accused him of stealing the newspapers. They claimed to have video evidence to support their accusation and made it clear that they would not allow him to leave the store. When they all looked at the video it turned out to feature someone who was clearly not Mr Blacker. Instead of releasing him after seeing this, the staff continued to detain him. The police were called. A policewoman did then make inquiries at the newsagents and he was released. Only after he wrote about the incident in a national newspaper did Somerfield even send a letter of apology. The company has not, though, offered any compensation. Indeed, the store has suggested that being involved in incidents like this is a price that people should be willing to pay to help support the fight against shoplifting. That, though, is not the view the law takes. Any one making a \"citizen's arrest\", which is what Somerfield did, has to get it absolutely right. Even making a reasonable mistake about someone's guilt does not provide an excuse if a person is wrongly arrested - or falsely imprisoned, as it is legally known. In 1912 the wife of the manager of WH Smiths at Kings Cross, John Walters, was found to be selling newspapers from her own newsstand in Staines that had been taken from that branch of WH Smiths without payment. The company's management arrested Walters at work. At trial the jury accepted he was not guilty of theft as he had intended paying for the newspapers. This meant that no criminal offence had been committed and that the arrest was wrongful. A civil court subsequently awarded him \u00a375 compensation, a sum equivalent to nearly \u00a35,000 in today's values. While that is perhaps more than Blacker would receive if he sued Somerfield, the level of damages in such cases - usually assessed by a civil jury - tend to be generous compared with those awarded to, say, accident victims. In a much worse case than Walters' or Blackers', Steven Smith was last year awarded a total of \u00a331,500 against the West Sussex police. They arrested him without believing he had committed any offence, inflicted very minor injuries in the course of doing so, then held him for nine hours. Despite Mr Smith's case, claims against the police are generally harder to prove, because the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 allows for them, unlike store detectives, to make lawful arrests so long as they have reasonable grounds to suspect an offence. Anyone who finds themselves faced with a false accusation of shoplifting should make it clear that they are not prepared to go anywhere with store staff unless they are formally arrested. There is, of course, no obligation on someone in this situation to prove their innocence. Somerfield's and retailers organisations' spokesmen have suggested that Mr Blacker could have taken steps to avoid the incident, such as opening the newspapers he had bought before walking into the shop. However, there is no obligation to do so. Nor is there any obligation to let store staff inspect one's bags or to produce a receipt. Supermarkets have every right to prevent theft from their stores, but the law requires them to enforce that right only by employing competent, vigilant staff who can distinguish between shoplifters and honest shoppers. The price of getting it wrong is as high for bullying security staff as it is for their victims, something Somerfield will discover if Mr Blacker decides to take the matter further. \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister",

However, obtaining a seat at the advertised prices is near impossible. </p> <p>Earlier this summer offerings included an improbable \u00a331 return to Venice. That fare, as the company likes to point out, is scarcely enough to cover the tax. </p> <p>Closer inspection of the small - in fact virtually microscopic - print at the bottom of the advertisement indicated that the real charge for the flight was \u00a334, after a \u00a33 charge for using a credit card, the only means of payment permitted, is added. </p> <p>Theoretically, that could lead to a prosecution under the misleading price marking regulations, but the triviality of the matter, coupled with the fact RyanAir is based in the Irish Republic, has so far deterred trading standards officers from taking any action. </p> <p>However, \u00a331, or even \u00a334, fares were very difficult to find on the website to which the advert directs you. </p> <p>I inserted eight or nine dates at random and found that fares ranged between \u00a382 and \u00a3122, still reasonable value, but the company's method of advertising had left a slightly bad taste. </p> <p>Of course, the words \"from\" and \"subject to availability\", the stopgaps of companies which see nothing wrong in advertising what they don't usually offer, can also be found in RyanAir's small print.

      "bodyText": "RyanAir's advertising is eye-catching for one thing: the price at which it offers flights. However, obtaining a seat at the advertised prices is near impossible. Earlier this summer offerings included an improbable \u00a331 return to Venice. That fare, as the company likes to point out, is scarcely enough to cover the tax. Closer inspection of the small - in fact virtually microscopic - print at the bottom of the advertisement indicated that the real charge for the flight was \u00a334, after a \u00a33 charge for using a credit card, the only means of payment permitted, is added. Theoretically, that could lead to a prosecution under the misleading price marking regulations, but the triviality of the matter, coupled with the fact RyanAir is based in the Irish Republic, has so far deterred trading standards officers from taking any action. However, \u00a331, or even \u00a334, fares were very difficult to find on the website to which the advert directs you. I inserted eight or nine dates at random and found that fares ranged between \u00a382 and \u00a3122, still reasonable value, but the company's method of advertising had left a slightly bad taste. Of course, the words \"from\" and \"subject to availability\", the stopgaps of companies which see nothing wrong in advertising what they don't usually offer, can also be found in RyanAir's small print. The words are again far from a watertight guarantee against prosecution but no action appears to have been taken. RyanAir's luck with the law continued when Jouko Nyakanen, who had booked a RyanAir flight, from Stanstead to Stockholm in February, sought the advice of the Consumers' Association. His flight had been due to leave at 5.30pm. The screens at the airport told him that it had been delayed. As the screens continued relaying this message, he and several other passengers hung around waiting to be told to board, only to discover, eventually, from the RyanAir desk that the flight had actually taken off without them. Mr Nyakanen wanted compensation from RyanAir, and there wouldn't really seem to be any doubt that he is entitled to it. Even if the airport, rather than the airline, was to blame for the incorrect information being put on the board, RyanAir's staff should have been aware of this and let the passenger know what was going on. Their failure to do so gives Mr Nyakanen a claim of negligence and breach of contract. The Consumers' Assocation advised Mr Nyakanen in its Which? publication that the legal position isn't clear-cut. In a sense that is true. There could be a real dispute between the airline and the airport over the extent to which the airport has to contribute to anything that RyanAir pays Mr Nyakanen, but that doesn't affect the position between him and the airline. When I discussed the matter with the Consumers' Association, a lawyer accepted that the airline appeared to have been negligent, but said that the article was not intended to state the law although it appeared to be attempting to do precisely that. Whether it is worth any passenger suing for the small sum that Mr Nyakanen might hope to recover is doubtful, but consumers should appreciate that when they are let down by an airline, as with any other business, the law is usually on their side. \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister",

Perhaps Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director and the team's coach, might have been forgiven for feeling that Cole's presence at the European Under-21 championships earlier in the summer, which the 18-year-old missed through injury, might have been enough to alter the complexion of what turned out to be a dismal experience. </p> <p>Wilkinson's starting line-up included four new caps: the defenders Adam Newton of West Ham, Titus Bramble of Ipswich and Ashley Cole of Arsenal, and the midfielder Michael Carrick of West Ham, playing alongside his club-mate Joe Cole in a midfield completed by David Dunn. </p> <p>Joe Cole, starting an Under-21 match for the first time after coming on as a substitute against Argentina in February, provided the game's first moment of distinction after 10 minutes by producing a stepover that befuddled his marker, Jaba Mujiri, before flighting a right-wing cross which his namesake headed just over George Lomaia's bar. </p> <p>Seven minutes later, after Gia Imedadze and David Digmelashvili had both fired high from long range for the visitors, England took the lead when Luke Young rose to Joe Cole's right-wing corner and met it with a robust header. Lomaia, who was already looking vulnerable, could only wave as it went inside his left-hand post. </p> <p>England's old-fashioned 4-3-3 gave Jonathan Greening, out of favour for the past year at Manchester United, scope to roam across the front line, but it also placed a considerable burden on Carrick, asked to play the holding role in front of the central man-markers. After 29 minutes he was left exposed as the last man when Klimenti Tsitaishvili ran on to a long ball and held off the West Ham man before lobbing over Paul Robinson to level the scores with the aplomb of a young man who made his First Division debut at the age of 14 and is now with Maccabi Tel Aviv. </p> <p>But the combination of the two Coles restored England's lead eight minutes before half- time when Ashley played the ball up to Joe on the edge of the area, collected the cleverly delayed return pass and fired past Lomaia from 15 yards. A further piece of wizardry from the West Ham prodigy enabled England to extend the advantage after 44 minutes when Francis Jeffers nudged home a loose ball after Darius Vassell had nodded down a cross from the right, and a minute later Dunn made it 4-1 when he ran in from the left to shoot home from the edge of the area. </p> <p>The goal was Dunn's last act, for Wilkinson chose to use the interval to introduce three more players to international football at this level, and the captain was withdrawn in order to give a first cap to David Prutton, Nottingham Forest's coveted midfielder, arriving with Clarke Carlisle of Queens Park Rangers and Stephen Wright of Liverpool. </p> <p>The rearranged rearguard showed signs of nerves five minutes into the second half when George Shengalia of Dinamo Tbilisi rose to meet Tsitaishvilli's dipping cross but failed to keep his volley down. </p> <p>Joe Cole, who had taken the captain's armband on Dunn's departure, demonstrated his ability to accelerate past an opponent when he left Tsereteli trailing in his wake before shimmying past Khizaneishvili on the edge of the area and screwing a low cross-shot wide. </p> <p>But it was Greening who struck England's next blow, turning inside the area after 61 minutes to guide a low shot past the left hand of the substitute goalkeeper, Mirza Merlani. Greening's reward was an immediate withdrawal as Wilkinson sent on a further gaggle of substitutes, including Andy Campbell, the local hero, and Watford's Tommy Smith, who duly obliged from close range in injury-time. </p> <p> <strong> England Under-21</strong> (4-3-3): <strong> Robinson</strong> (Leeds United); <strong> Newton</strong> (West Ham), <strong> Bramble</strong> (Ipswich, <strong> Wright </strong> (Liverpool<strong> </strong> h-t), <strong> Young</strong> (Tottenham; <strong> Carlisle</strong> , QPR, h-t), <strong> A Cole</strong> (Arsenal; <strong> Smith</strong> , Watford,73; <strong> J Cole</strong> (West Ham; <strong> Parker, </strong> Charlton 73), <strong> Carrick</strong> (West Ham; <strong> Hargreaves</strong> , Bayern Munich, 62), <strong> Dunn</strong> (Blackburn; <strong> Prutton</strong> , Forest, h-t); <strong> Greening</strong> (Man United; <strong> Campbell</strong> , Middlesbrough, 62), <strong> Jeffers</strong> (Everton; <strong> Chadwick</strong> , Man Utd, 62), <strong> Vassell</strong> (Aston Villa; <strong> Thirlwell</strong> , Sunderland,73) </p> <p><strong> Georgia U-21</strong> (1-4-3-2): <strong> Lomaia</strong> (Lokomotiv Tbilisi); <strong> Khizaneishvili</strong> (Spartak Moscow); <strong> Sasaia</strong> (Wit-Georgia Tblisi), <strong> Tsereteli</strong> (Alania Vladikavkaz), <strong> Abramidze</strong> (Lokomotiv Tbilisi), <strong> Mujiri</strong> (Wit-Georgia Tbilisi); <strong> Digmelashvili</strong> (Wit-Georgia Tbilisi), <strong> Kvaratskhelia</strong> (Lokomotiv Tbilisi), <strong> Gvazava</strong> (Zimbru); <strong> Imedadze</strong> (Torpedo Kutaisi), <strong> Tsitaishvili</strong> (Maccabi Tel Aviv). </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : T Hauge (Norway).</p>",

      "body": "<p>As officials emerged from yesterday's meeting in Geneva to announce the end of the transfer system, the implications were already being felt hundreds of miles away at Boundary Park and, for that matter, all the other small clubs in Europe. </p> <p>Oldham Athletic's public relations officer Gordon Lawton had just heard Sepp Blatter on the radio announcing that the transfer system was dead; no longer will clubs have to pay fees for players aged 24 or more.</p> <p>For Lawton and his fellow officials at the Lancashire Second Division club, the Fifa president's words could sound the death knell for an institution they serve and support so loyally. \"We rely on transfer money, it helps keep the club afloat,\" he said. \"It's vital for clubs like ours. It's the only thing that keeps us going.</p> <p>\"We have enough trouble as it is. It can be a real struggle trying to make ends meet on a weekly basis. This is going to make it even harder.\" </p> <p>Lawton estimates that by selling one player a season for a minimum of \u00a3500,000 Oldham, a Premiership club from 1991-94, can stay afloat. \"That sort of money helps pay the wages of all non-playing staff for the whole year and a number of other expenses.\" </p> <p>Oldham sold the full-back Carl Serrant to Newcastle United for \u00a3600,000 in September 1998 and last season Stuart Barlow joined Wigan for \u00a370,000. </p> <p>Under Fifa's new proposals they would have got nothing for Barlow while the loss of Serrant, who was coming up to his 23rd birthday, would only have yielded compensation. Though it is not clear how much, Lawton believes that it would have been nowhere near the amount they actually banked for the defender. </p> <p>\"Things are just going to get harder for us with these new rules,\" Lawton added. \"It's going to be fine for the big boys and the big-name players. They will be able to go out there, pay big salaries and the players will get fat salaries. It's a payday for them but not for us and our players.\" </p> <p>The European Commission decided to challenge the current transfer system following a complaint from the Italian club Perugia, who refused to pay a transfer fee to a Belgian club. The commission believes that as in any other industry, players should have the right to change employers provided they give a period of notice. </p> <p>Lawton, however, believes that politicians need to take into account the unique nature of sport in general and football in particular. </p> <p>Oldham claim that it was difficult enough adjusting to the demands of the Bosman ruling but that these plans will be much harder to come to terms with. </p> <p>While Fifa has said that compensation should be paid for players aged 18 to 24 and that this might benefit some clubs who lose out on players they have helped develop, Lawton believes that the amounts may not be enough to guarantee the financial future of small clubs. </p> <p>He said: \"Who knows, we might go under with an end to transfers. Life is going to be very difficult.

      "bodyText": "As officials emerged from yesterday's meeting in Geneva to announce the end of the transfer system, the implications were already being felt hundreds of miles away at Boundary Park and, for that matter, all the other small clubs in Europe. Oldham Athletic's public relations officer Gordon Lawton had just heard Sepp Blatter on the radio announcing that the transfer system was dead; no longer will clubs have to pay fees for players aged 24 or more. For Lawton and his fellow officials at the Lancashire Second Division club, the Fifa president's words could sound the death knell for an institution they serve and support so loyally. \"We rely on transfer money, it helps keep the club afloat,\" he said. \"It's vital for clubs like ours. It's the only thing that keeps us going. \"We have enough trouble as it is. It can be a real struggle trying to make ends meet on a weekly basis. This is going to make it even harder.\" Lawton estimates that by selling one player a season for a minimum of \u00a3500,000 Oldham, a Premiership club from 1991-94, can stay afloat. \"That sort of money helps pay the wages of all non-playing staff for the whole year and a number of other expenses.\" Oldham sold the full-back Carl Serrant to Newcastle United for \u00a3600,000 in September 1998 and last season Stuart Barlow joined Wigan for \u00a370,000. Under Fifa's new proposals they would have got nothing for Barlow while the loss of Serrant, who was coming up to his 23rd birthday, would only have yielded compensation. Though it is not clear how much, Lawton believes that it would have been nowhere near the amount they actually banked for the defender. \"Things are just going to get harder for us with these new rules,\" Lawton added. \"It's going to be fine for the big boys and the big-name players. They will be able to go out there, pay big salaries and the players will get fat salaries. It's a payday for them but not for us and our players.\" The European Commission decided to challenge the current transfer system following a complaint from the Italian club Perugia, who refused to pay a transfer fee to a Belgian club. The commission believes that as in any other industry, players should have the right to change employers provided they give a period of notice. Lawton, however, believes that politicians need to take into account the unique nature of sport in general and football in particular. Oldham claim that it was difficult enough adjusting to the demands of the Bosman ruling but that these plans will be much harder to come to terms with. While Fifa has said that compensation should be paid for players aged 18 to 24 and that this might benefit some clubs who lose out on players they have helped develop, Lawton believes that the amounts may not be enough to guarantee the financial future of small clubs. He said: \"Who knows, we might go under with an end to transfers. Life is going to be very difficult. This whole thing could be a real disaster. \"We need solid transfer money, not vague guarantees of compensation.\" Others within the game believe that the issue of compensation has not been properly thought out and could cause even more problems for clubs and players. John Barnwell, head of the League Managers' Association and who was following yesterday's events in Zurich, said: \"How will levels of compensation be sorted out? \"For players under 24 do you evaluate it on training and time spent with a young footballer? If so, do you pay the same amount of compensation for someone who has been at Liverpool's academy as you do for someone who has been at Exeter?\" Fifa has not announced how it will evaluate compensation levels.

Bogarde, who also interested Newcastle, has won 19 caps for Holland was in the Ajax squad that won the Champions Leauge in 1995 and linked up again with Louis van Gaal at Barcelona after an unsuccessful spell with Milan. Meanwhile Thome, upset at quickly losing his place to Leboeuf after just one game this season - in the dismal defeat at Bradford City last week - jumped at the chance to become Sunderland's record purchase. The 28-year-old centre-back took only two hours to sign a \u00a31 million-a-year contract which will keep him at the Stadium of Light until 2004. Peter Reid moved for Thome after finally abandoning hope of securing Ugo Ehiogu from Aston Villa and will give the Brazilian his debut at home against West Ham on Wednesday. Thome, signed by Vialli had Sheffield Wednesday, made 20 league appearances for Chelsea.",

With survival on their minds, the West Indies openers scored at less than one run per over.</p> <p>After a lengthy afternoon stoppage for rain, a diminished crowd roared Darren Gough and Andy Caddick in at the start of the mini-session, though they made little headway as they bowled unchanged until bad light ended the day's play prematurely. Adrian Griffith can count himself lucky to have survived a good lbw shout to Caddick after the ball looked to have pitched on the stumps and stayed straight.</p> <p>West Indies' bowlers had earlier taken England's remaining five wickets for the addition of 60 more runs as England were all out for 281. England's last two wickets fell in a rain-shortened afternoon session to add to the three England lost in a crazy half-hour before lunch.</p> <p>In truth, batting looked a different prospect on this pitch in the morning session - no one could manage a boundary until Caddick cut Walsh for four at 3.40pm - and yesterday's opening stand of 159 from Michael Atherton and Marcus Trescothick could yet prove vital in the context of this Test match: England's remaining nine wickets put on a combined total of 122. </p> <p>Walsh huffed and puffed at the tail after the rain break: he gave Caddick a withering glare as he departed after mishooking to Hinds at leg gully for just that one scoring shot and Gough, who earlier pulled MacLean for four, received a nasty short ball from Courtney which he just managed to duck under.</p> <p>When White cut the last ball of a Walsh over for four, run-gathering looked a touch easier.

      "bodyText": "England's bowlers were unable to force a breakthrough in a 14-over spell at the end of the second day as Adrian Griffith (4*) and Sherwin Campbell (6*) held firm at the Oval. With survival on their minds, the West Indies openers scored at less than one run per over. After a lengthy afternoon stoppage for rain, a diminished crowd roared Darren Gough and Andy Caddick in at the start of the mini-session, though they made little headway as they bowled unchanged until bad light ended the day's play prematurely. Adrian Griffith can count himself lucky to have survived a good lbw shout to Caddick after the ball looked to have pitched on the stumps and stayed straight. West Indies' bowlers had earlier taken England's remaining five wickets for the addition of 60 more runs as England were all out for 281. England's last two wickets fell in a rain-shortened afternoon session to add to the three England lost in a crazy half-hour before lunch. In truth, batting looked a different prospect on this pitch in the morning session - no one could manage a boundary until Caddick cut Walsh for four at 3.40pm - and yesterday's opening stand of 159 from Michael Atherton and Marcus Trescothick could yet prove vital in the context of this Test match: England's remaining nine wickets put on a combined total of 122. Walsh huffed and puffed at the tail after the rain break: he gave Caddick a withering glare as he departed after mishooking to Hinds at leg gully for just that one scoring shot and Gough, who earlier pulled MacLean for four, received a nasty short ball from Courtney which he just managed to duck under. When White cut the last ball of a Walsh over for four, run-gathering looked a touch easier. The last pair added 17 before Walsh bowled Gough with an offcutter and England were 281 all out. Earlier, Thorpe and Hick had been the model of studiousness while they were denying West Indies for 90 minutes, after the visitors took the new ball at the start of the first full over of the day. Curbing their naturally attacking instincts, they held firm as the ball swished past edges, gloves and stumps and rapped dangerously onto pads.

The preliminary report into the crash on July 25 that killed all 109 on board the supersonic plane and four on the ground, showed that the inspection had been delayed for a fire practice. Three inspections are usually carried out at the Paris airport at flexible times, compared to at least five a day at London's Heathrow, it emerged.

A partial inspection was made at 2:30pm because a plane was believed to have collided with a bird. But a second full inspection at 3pm was postponed because of the fire practice between 2:35 and 3:10pm). This showed the runway was not fully inspected for more than 12 hours before the Concorde took off, at 4:42pm. A British Airports Authority (BAA) spokeswoman said: \"We carry out about five inspections under normal circumstances, but if there are adverse weather conditions we would do more. \"All the inspections are the same and take around 45 minutes to complete and are done throughout the day, but not at any set time. \"A 12-hour delay between inspections would not happen at Heathrow.\" No conclusions were drawn from the preliminary crash report, published on the internet, but the inspection delay did not necessarily have a bearing on the presence of a metal strip that gashed the plane's tyres. An airport official said nothing untoward had been reported on the runway, either by pilots using it or by cleaners and the firemen in the hours leading up to the crash. \"If anything wrong would have existed, it would have been noticed immediately,\" airport authority spokesman Didier Hamon said at a Paris news conference. \"We do believe that everything was done that day as it is normal to do,\" he added. \"On that day, nothing abnormal, nothing exceptional was reported to the airport authority.\" It could be at least a year before the final report is published by the BEA - France's Accident and Inquiry Office.

      "bodyText": "The saga of Scotland's discredited examination authority descended into farce yesterday when it emerged that customary computer checks on exam results had not been carried out. An undisclosed number of pupils have been told they have failed new-style higher grade exams when they should have passed, while others have received lower grades than they should have. Although the Scottish Qualifications Authority has consistently claimed there was no lowering of quality control in this year's procedures, it yesterday belatedly conceded that computer checks had not been done on the results in the new highers, as they would have been done in past years. The Headteachers' Association Scotland has said that the discrepancies in grades predicted by schools and what pupils obtained was two to three times what would otherwise be expected. In some schools it was up to 10 times greater. The Scottish executive said yesterday that a lack of computer checks might account for some of these anomalies. Nicola Sturgeon, education spokeswoman for the Scottish National party, commented that the authority had now lost all credibility. \"We are not talking about a few thousand results being wrong. We are now talking about potentially every new higher result having doubt cast upon it,\" she said. In past years, the authority used a computer programme to check quality control - the \"derived grades procedure\", which took into account a school's prediction as to its student's exam grade to raise a mark if he or she came close to a cut-off point between grades; it could therefore result in a pupil jumping up a grade, and sometimes applying the procedure could mean the difference between someone having a pass or a fail. The authority yesterday admitted that the programme had not been used this year because school predictions were not available. It promised, however, that any anomalies would be sorted out by its appeals procedure, and said that the programme would be reinstated for next year's exams. A deadline for submitting appeals has been set for this weekend. However, the corrected results following an appeal are not expected to be announced for a number of weeks - thus leaving students who have been mistakenly told they have failed to meet the standard required for their chosen university to possibly find out that they have in fact done sufficiently well to merit entry, just as they are about to start an alternative, fall-back course. David Caldwell, director of Coshep, the Scottish university principals' organisation, said yesterday that the universities would endeavour to make sure that all students whose successful appeals meant that their results met the requirements of their offer through Ucas, the universities' clearing house, would get on to their chosen university course. \"The timing is awkward, as the results of the appeals will be coming through at the same time as the academic year begins, but we will do our best to make sure no one is disadvantaged.\" Brian Monteith, the Conservative education spokesman, said that the authority could no longer be taken at its word, as it had previously repeatedly asserted that its quality control was the same as in previous years. The continuing crisis is putting increasing pressure on the Scottish education minister, Sam Galbraith, for him to resign. He does not accept he has the ultimate responsibility for the authority's failings, but he may not be able to ride out the storm much longer. When the Scottish parliament reconvenes next week, he will be called before its education committee, where he will face fierce questioning as both the Conservatives and the SNP attempt to secure his ministerial scalp. If Mr Galbraith does not perform sufficiently well in front of the committee, he may be forced to go then. From bad to worse March Ministers learn there are problems, but are assured they will be sorted out by the qualifications authority. August 10 Results sent out. Thousands of pupils receive incomplete or inaccurate certificates; thousands more receive none at all; and many certificates make no sense. August 11 Principals of Scottish universities say they have no confidence in the authority. August 12 Authority chief executive Ron Tuck resigns. August 17 A level results published outside Scotland, while 5,000 Scottish students continue to await accurate results. August 21 Scottish executive confirms 700 students will be late in entering clearing. August 23 Ucas says number of Scottish pupils taking up university places has fallen 6.6%. August 29 Authority admits 4,000 standard grade pupils given incorrect results. August 30 Authority admits faxing wrong standard grade results to schools. Two senior figures resign.

      "body": "<p>The demand by Tory health spokesman Liam Fox for stricter English language tests for overseas-born doctors was bound to warm the hearts of racists. But it highlighted the extent to which frontline public services have become dependent on imported labour to keep the show on the road. </p> <p>Reliance on foreign professionals goes beyond doctors, more than a quarter of whom qualified overseas. Without a continuing transfusion of nurses, teachers and social workers, health, education and social services in some parts of the country would be unable to function. Five years ago, the proportion of nurses from overseas registering in Britain was 12%. By last year it had risen to 28% and the numbers have increased sharply in recent months. The number of nurses recruited from the Philippines - already one of the largest overseas groups - is estimated to have risen by 400% in the past year. </p> <p>With schools this week facing an unprecedented shortage of teachers, local authorities in London are scouring such English-speaking countries as Australia and Canada to fill the vacancies. TimePlan, the biggest supply agency, has a target to hire almost 2,000 extra teachers; it estimates that at least 3,000 overseas teachers are required to staff London schools all year round. Supply teaching agencies in some parts of the capital say that up to 70% of teachers on their books are from abroad. </p> <p>There is also a severe shortage of social workers and an increasing number of South Africans, Scandinavians and Belgians are being brought over to make up the numbers. A confidential survey for the Association of London Government earlier this year found staff vacancies have reached 50% in some London social services departments. And with police numbers down almost 3,000 since Labour was returned to office, Home Office officials are considering changing the rules to allow the police to recruit from abroad. </p> <p>A crisis in public sector recruitment has been building for almost 20 years and pay is at the heart of it. After an initial partial catch-up at the start of Margaret Thatcher's first term in office, public service workers have seen their pay fall relentlessly behind ever since. Between 1982 and 1997, the gap between the average earnings of public employees and those of the private sector grew by 16%. After 1993, when the government froze the public sector pay bill, increases were achieved only by shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs. With Gordon Brown committed to maintaining Tory spending plans during Labour's first two years in office, the squeeze continued, while seven years of growth continued to drive private sector earnings ahead. </p> <p>Between 1992 and 1999, official figures show that the hourly real-terms pay of private sector employees increased by 4.2% more than that of their public sector counterparts. While private sector employees' pay increased as the chart shows, the real hourly rate for teachers actually fell - partly because older teachers were leaving the profession and being replaced by less-experienced and lower-paid staff. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as the labour market has tightened in the wider economy, particularly in the south-east, and skill shortages have started to force up pay, private sector employers have also been looking abroad to offset the lack of trained staff in Britain and take the pressure off their payrolls. </p> <p>The CBI describes skills shortages as serious and growing - though less pronounced than in previous periods of sustained growth - and highlights the short supply of IT and computer professionals in particular. Others point to pressure in sales, customer and financial services and construction. </p> <p>A survey by the Cranfield School of Management cited the recruitment of overseas staff - from South Africa, Australia and the EU in particular - as a significant factor in offsetting upward pressure on pay. </p> <p>If better paid jobs in the private sector and lack of affordable housing in London are aspects of the public sector crisis they are not the only factors. Unison, the public services union, points to the the treatment of employees in the public sector and the way their jobs have been undervalued over the past two decades. \"The culture of private good, public bad and the way some people have come to sneer at the public ethos inevitably leads to demoralisation\". Teachers' leaders make similar complaints. They do not expect that new incentive packages or overall government spending increases will close the public-private pay gap in the foreseeable future so dependence on foreign workers is bound to continue. </p> <p>In fact, numbers will have to increase - particularly in health - to meet the government's targets. The NHS is already short of about 17,000 nurses and needs several thousand extra doctors, dentists and consultants - while moves to boost training numbers will take years to feed through. The government is relying on surpluses of doctors in countries such as Spain and an \"over-supply\" of nurses in some parts of Scandinavia to meet their targets. It has also sanctioned an NHS agreement with the Chinese government to use Chinese nurses on short-term contracts. </p> <p>Since the end of last year, recruitment of health professionals from developing countries has been officially discouraged, unless home governments give consent. NHS recruitment of South African nurses has been cut back since Nelson Mandela appealed to Tony Blair to stop leeching his country's desperately-needed health workers. But the Philippines is considered an exception because it trains more nurses than it employs and depends on their foreign currency remittances. </p> <p>But these are short-term stopgap measures. \"People from overseas have made an outstanding contribution to our public services and we're glad they came here,\" says Unison. \"But we shouldn't be poaching from countries that need them - we should be making these jobs attractive enough for people here.\" </p> <p> Seumas Milne is our labour editor </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:seumas.milne@theguardian.com\"> seumas.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The demand by Tory health spokesman Liam Fox for stricter English language tests for overseas-born doctors was bound to warm the hearts of racists. But it highlighted the extent to which frontline public services have become dependent on imported labour to keep the show on the road. Reliance on foreign professionals goes beyond doctors, more than a quarter of whom qualified overseas. Without a continuing transfusion of nurses, teachers and social workers, health, education and social services in some parts of the country would be unable to function. Five years ago, the proportion of nurses from overseas registering in Britain was 12%. By last year it had risen to 28% and the numbers have increased sharply in recent months. The number of nurses recruited from the Philippines - already one of the largest overseas groups - is estimated to have risen by 400% in the past year. With schools this week facing an unprecedented shortage of teachers, local authorities in London are scouring such English-speaking countries as Australia and Canada to fill the vacancies. TimePlan, the biggest supply agency, has a target to hire almost 2,000 extra teachers; it estimates that at least 3,000 overseas teachers are required to staff London schools all year round. Supply teaching agencies in some parts of the capital say that up to 70% of teachers on their books are from abroad. There is also a severe shortage of social workers and an increasing number of South Africans, Scandinavians and Belgians are being brought over to make up the numbers. A confidential survey for the Association of London Government earlier this year found staff vacancies have reached 50% in some London social services departments. And with police numbers down almost 3,000 since Labour was returned to office, Home Office officials are considering changing the rules to allow the police to recruit from abroad. A crisis in public sector recruitment has been building for almost 20 years and pay is at the heart of it. After an initial partial catch-up at the start of Margaret Thatcher's first term in office, public service workers have seen their pay fall relentlessly behind ever since. Between 1982 and 1997, the gap between the average earnings of public employees and those of the private sector grew by 16%. After 1993, when the government froze the public sector pay bill, increases were achieved only by shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs. With Gordon Brown committed to maintaining Tory spending plans during Labour's first two years in office, the squeeze continued, while seven years of growth continued to drive private sector earnings ahead. Between 1992 and 1999, official figures show that the hourly real-terms pay of private sector employees increased by 4.2% more than that of their public sector counterparts. While private sector employees' pay increased as the chart shows, the real hourly rate for teachers actually fell - partly because older teachers were leaving the profession and being replaced by less-experienced and lower-paid staff. Meanwhile, as the labour market has tightened in the wider economy, particularly in the south-east, and skill shortages have started to force up pay, private sector employers have also been looking abroad to offset the lack of trained staff in Britain and take the pressure off their payrolls. The CBI describes skills shortages as serious and growing - though less pronounced than in previous periods of sustained growth - and highlights the short supply of IT and computer professionals in particular. Others point to pressure in sales, customer and financial services and construction. A survey by the Cranfield School of Management cited the recruitment of overseas staff - from South Africa, Australia and the EU in particular - as a significant factor in offsetting upward pressure on pay. If better paid jobs in the private sector and lack of affordable housing in London are aspects of the public sector crisis they are not the only factors. Unison, the public services union, points to the the treatment of employees in the public sector and the way their jobs have been undervalued over the past two decades. \"The culture of private good, public bad and the way some people have come to sneer at the public ethos inevitably leads to demoralisation\". Teachers' leaders make similar complaints. They do not expect that new incentive packages or overall government spending increases will close the public-private pay gap in the foreseeable future so dependence on foreign workers is bound to continue. In fact, numbers will have to increase - particularly in health - to meet the government's targets. The NHS is already short of about 17,000 nurses and needs several thousand extra doctors, dentists and consultants - while moves to boost training numbers will take years to feed through. The government is relying on surpluses of doctors in countries such as Spain and an \"over-supply\" of nurses in some parts of Scandinavia to meet their targets. It has also sanctioned an NHS agreement with the Chinese government to use Chinese nurses on short-term contracts. Since the end of last year, recruitment of health professionals from developing countries has been officially discouraged, unless home governments give consent. NHS recruitment of South African nurses has been cut back since Nelson Mandela appealed to Tony Blair to stop leeching his country's desperately-needed health workers. But the Philippines is considered an exception because it trains more nurses than it employs and depends on their foreign currency remittances. But these are short-term stopgap measures. \"People from overseas have made an outstanding contribution to our public services and we're glad they came here,\" says Unison. \"But we shouldn't be poaching from countries that need them - we should be making these jobs attractive enough for people here.\" Seumas Milne is our labour editor seumas.milne@theguardian.com",

With GPRS, an \"always on\" network designed for data (ie internet) calls, said to be just around the corner, this problem will be resolved in the next six months. Most pundits believe Wap won't really take off until GPRS becomes widely available. </p> <p>BT Cellnet was the first UK network to launch GPRS services in the summer this year, although the other networks claim to be close behind. The BT Cellnet service, PocketNet Office, is only available to corporate users at present and costs \u00a345 per month for 50mb of data traffic (different pricing plans apply with GPRS), plus around \u00a3199 for the handset (Motorola Timeport) and standard charges for voice calls. It is expected that the GPRS service and handsets will be rolled out to consumers at the beginning of 2001. Clearly, like Wap handsets, these handsets will no doubt be subsidised to drive mass market uptake. </p> <p>PDA manufacturers are currently working with the mobile operators on ways in which they can develop add-ons to handheld devices that convert the PDA into a GPRS phone. The latest devices from Microsoft's PocketPC division have been developed so that GPRS attachments can easily be slotted onto the devices once they become available. </p> <p><strong>What is i-mode?</strong></p> <p>While Europe and the US is stuck with Wap, i-mode is taking Japan by storm. I-mode is the mobile internet technology developed by NTT DoCoMo and unlike Wap, is always switched on so that users are pushed internet services rather than having to pull them from (dial up to) Wapsites. DoCoMo is currently causing friction among Wap developers in Europe and the US by talking about international expansion, in particular expanding its i-mode software beyond Japan. Given the lack-lustre reaction to Wap since it launched over here and the operators crying out for more flexible technology, it is perhaps the perfect time for i-mode to make its move on Europe and the US. </p> <p>It may be a few years, though, until DoCoMo is able to make its move on the UK. Its partnership with TIW, the owner of the UK's fifth UMTS third-generation mobile phone network, could lead to TIW opting for I-mode technology above Wap, but it is still early days and nothing has yet been confirmed. Whether I-mode takes off over here is yet to be determined, particularly since all European operators have now accepted Wap as a standard.</p> <p><strong>HTML browsing</strong></p> <p>While acceptance of Wap technology has been rapid among operators that now install Wap browsers on new phones as a matter of course, the fact that HTML browser software exists for mobile phones has been largely overlooked. At present, Wap is seen as something of a hassle given that Wap browsers can't read HTML pages (ie web pages), and Wapsites have to be written in wireless mark-up language (WML) and organised in decks, which are different for every device. </p> <p>This could soon change, however. A growing number of mobile phone operators have already started offering Wap users the option of a second mobile internet browser. The Sony Z5 not only comes with a pre-installed Wap browser but also has Microsoft Mobile Explorer built in, which supports HTML (i.e the language in which websites are written). Mobile phone manufacturer Benefon is also about to launch a phone with MME preinstalled. Sadly, unlike PCs, users can't just download a HTML micro-browser onto their phone, or for that matter any upgrades to current applications. </p> <p>MME software means that users aren't restricted to browsing the small number of Wapsites currently available, and instead, can browse websites through their phones. Generally, MME allows websites to be displayed as text, although the browser doesn't currently support graphics such as Flash or ActiveX. </p>",

Most pundits believe Wap won't really take off until GPRS becomes widely available. BT Cellnet was the first UK network to launch GPRS services in the summer this year, although the other networks claim to be close behind. The BT Cellnet service, PocketNet Office, is only available to corporate users at present and costs \u00a345 per month for 50mb of data traffic (different pricing plans apply with GPRS), plus around \u00a3199 for the handset (Motorola Timeport) and standard charges for voice calls. It is expected that the GPRS service and handsets will be rolled out to consumers at the beginning of 2001. Clearly, like Wap handsets, these handsets will no doubt be subsidised to drive mass market uptake. PDA manufacturers are currently working with the mobile operators on ways in which they can develop add-ons to handheld devices that convert the PDA into a GPRS phone. The latest devices from Microsoft's PocketPC division have been developed so that GPRS attachments can easily be slotted onto the devices once they become available. What is i-mode? While Europe and the US is stuck with Wap, i-mode is taking Japan by storm. I-mode is the mobile internet technology developed by NTT DoCoMo and unlike Wap, is always switched on so that users are pushed internet services rather than having to pull them from (dial up to) Wapsites. DoCoMo is currently causing friction among Wap developers in Europe and the US by talking about international expansion, in particular expanding its i-mode software beyond Japan. Given the lack-lustre reaction to Wap since it launched over here and the operators crying out for more flexible technology, it is perhaps the perfect time for i-mode to make its move on Europe and the US. It may be a few years, though, until DoCoMo is able to make its move on the UK. Its partnership with TIW, the owner of the UK's fifth UMTS third-generation mobile phone network, could lead to TIW opting for I-mode technology above Wap, but it is still early days and nothing has yet been confirmed. Whether I-mode takes off over here is yet to be determined, particularly since all European operators have now accepted Wap as a standard. HTML browsing While acceptance of Wap technology has been rapid among operators that now install Wap browsers on new phones as a matter of course, the fact that HTML browser software exists for mobile phones has been largely overlooked. At present, Wap is seen as something of a hassle given that Wap browsers can't read HTML pages (ie web pages), and Wapsites have to be written in wireless mark-up language (WML) and organised in decks, which are different for every device. This could soon change, however. A growing number of mobile phone operators have already started offering Wap users the option of a second mobile internet browser. The Sony Z5 not only comes with a pre-installed Wap browser but also has Microsoft Mobile Explorer built in, which supports HTML (i.e the language in which websites are written). Mobile phone manufacturer Benefon is also about to launch a phone with MME preinstalled. Sadly, unlike PCs, users can't just download a HTML micro-browser onto their phone, or for that matter any upgrades to current applications. MME software means that users aren't restricted to browsing the small number of Wapsites currently available, and instead, can browse websites through their phones. Generally, MME allows websites to be displayed as text, although the browser doesn't currently support graphics such as Flash or ActiveX.",

      "bodyText": "Headteacher Marjorie Evans today won her appeal against her conviction for slapping an unruly pupil at Cardiff crown court. High court judge Mr Justice McKinnon told a packed court he was allowing the challenge. He told Mrs Evans he believed her account of the incident, and that she would leave the court completely vindicated with her reputation unblemished. There were restrained cheers from her supporters in the public gallery when the judge announced his decision this morning. Mrs Evans, of Usk, south Wales, was given a three-month suspended sentence at Abergavenny magistrates court in south Wales in July, after stipendiary justice Vivian Manning-Davies found her guilty of common assault. The sentence has now been quashed and Mrs Evans is no longer liable for previous court costs. Summing up at the end of the two-day appeal hearing, defence barrister Greg Taylor said that there was \"no substance\" in the allegation that she had slapped a 10-year-old boy across the face after losing her temper with him. \"It doesn't make sense and the reason it does not make sense is because it is not true,\" Mr Taylor said. The 56-year-old headteacher with 35 years of experience admitted at the high court hearing that she used a textbook method to restrain the boy, who is now 11, but denied slapping him. She told the court the restraint was because he was trying to punch, push and headbutt her as they walked from the special needs unit to the main part of the south Wales junior school in September 1999. At the appeal hearing, she said she had warned other teachers about the boy, who suffers from attention deficient hyperactive disorder, because he \"had threatened to sue people\". Mrs Evans added that, after having to restrain the boy by taking his arms and folding them over his chest, he said: \"I'm going to sue you. You hit me.\" At the hearing yesterday, special needs teacher Sandra Cutler said she had heard Mrs Evans confess to slapping the youngster in the staff room at lunch time on the day of the incident. Mrs Cutler told the court she heard Mrs Evans say, \"Yes I hit him. And he won't be doing that again.\" She did not mention the incident to anyone and went to the police two days after the magistrates court hearing started on May 15 2000. Another teacher at the school, Janet Bowen, told the court Mrs Evans had told teachers in the staff room that day that she had not hit the boy, but had had to restrain him. On Wednesday, the first day of the trial, the boy told police in a videotaped interview that there had been a plan to get the head out of the school. Friends, family and leading members of the National Union of Teachers have been in court throughout the two-day hearing to show their support for Evans. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"I am very pleased to hear she has been found not guilty. \"I think this will raise public awareness of the difficulties teachers are faced with when dealing with disruptive pupils.\" Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Union of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: \"I think it is very welcome news and I just hope that in future youngsters who assault teachers are treated with equal severity by magistrates.\"",

      "body": "<p>When a man's house has to be fitted with reinforcements in order to take the weight of his records, you know that his vinyl addiction has reached rarely seen heights of severity. John Peel's record collection is beyond a joke. There's a large wooden shed used only to accommodate his 12-inch singles, and another one, just past the chicken coop, which houses the 45s. Being Britain's leading vanguard of any kind of music that falls out of the mainstream justifies the addiction somewhat, but these records aren't just the tools of his trade - they're too cherished for that.</p> <p>\"As my wife would confirm if she wasn't out shopping, I still spend an insane amount of time - six to eight hours a day - listening to records and putting together lists for the show,\" says Peel from the hub of his record world, which is his East Anglian farmhouse's old garage. All the new releases come here, a large cardboard box making up a week's worth of the records sent. The room has a boyish, den-like feel; between the racks of records and CDs are football memorabilia, photographs of his wife, Sheila, and hot rod magazines from the 50s and 60s.</p> <p>Although the room feels chaotic and cramped, the records are very well ordered. The ones chosen to be played on future shows are recorded on a list, before being elevated from the boxes on the floor to the heights of the collection itself. Each is recorded on a card index. \"People say, 'Why don't you put the collection on computer?' But to put 25,776 LPs on to a computer would almost certainly take the rest of my life.\"</p> <p>Passing into another room that houses Peel's first 1,500 records, it dawns on me that a curator's mindset must be essential just to keep the collection at least reasonably accessible. This is where his four children, and their boyfriends and girlfriends, come in handy. \"Last summer I paid my daughter Flossie's then boyfriend to file my seven-inch singles, and he turned out to be the best filer I ever had. Unfortunately he and Flossie broke up shortly afterwards. Young people have so little consideration. My son William did that lot of CDs,\" says Peel, pointing to a rack, \"and got paid prodigious sums of money to do so, but he took all summer - he's naturally an extremely indolent boy. He seems to have no grasp of the alphabet, either.\"</p> <p>Some men have garden sheds to potter about in and get away from the wife; Peel has his two outhouses of records. \"I'll come in here to find something, and almost always find something else that I've completely forgotten about. It's a great stress-reliever.\" Peel mulls over a 45 by Wild Willy Barrett, an eccentric hippie chiefly famed for his collaboration with 70s pub rocker John Otway. The record collector's mind is at work here - revelling in the obscure, celebrating the authentic, and finding release in a three-minute song.</p> <p>Peel has been a DJ since 1963, working in the US for a number of radio stations before joining Radio 1 from its birth in 1968. He has the freedom to play what he likes, and what tends to make it through is anything that fulfils a degree of honesty, be that a scratchy old reggae 45 or the latest student union indie favourite. A few records have moved beyond work into the realm of the intensely personal. \"I've got a clutch of about 20 records which I'll grab in an emergency, and which will go into the grave with me,\" Peel explains. They're all 45s, they're all impossibly obscure, and each one, says Peel, \"can almost always reduce me to tears\".</p> <p>Within this sacred box, there's a Jagger-Richards composition, I'd Rather Be Out with the Boys, by mid-1960s Manchester no-hit wonders the Toggery Five; and a great reggae take on Paul Simon's Richard Cory by Jamaican singer Yami Boro, who, not quite understanding the words of the song, called it Richer Cory. \"There's a reggae version of Whiter Shade of Pale which does the same thing,\" says Peel, \"but the lyrics of that song were complete bollocks anyway, so misinterpreting them just adds another dimension.\"</p> <p>There are also a number of heartbreaking early-70s soul ballads. In one, Stanley Winston's No More Ghettos in America, the singer's voice quivers before collapsing into feverish falsetto. \"This is the only record this guy made,\" Peel explains, just as Winston breaks down entirely. \"You hear somebody like Mick Hucknall described as a soul singer after his 25th LP. This guy made this one 45 and the first 30 seconds eclipses Hucknall's entire output.\" And each of these records tells a story in Peel's life - such as the R'n'B classic You'd Better Move On by Arthur Alexander. \"It was given to me by a girlfriend in Texas, and I think it was a hint. Her way of saying, 'Suit action to the title, fatboy.' \"</p> <p>A British institution, John Peel, like so many music lovers, is a sentimentalist at heart, a man who can live through his most valued vinyl finds. \"I'll play them all together one day,\" he says of his 20 moments of greatness, \"and then go mad.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "When a man's house has to be fitted with reinforcements in order to take the weight of his records, you know that his vinyl addiction has reached rarely seen heights of severity. John Peel's record collection is beyond a joke. There's a large wooden shed used only to accommodate his 12-inch singles, and another one, just past the chicken coop, which houses the 45s. Being Britain's leading vanguard of any kind of music that falls out of the mainstream justifies the addiction somewhat, but these records aren't just the tools of his trade - they're too cherished for that. \"As my wife would confirm if she wasn't out shopping, I still spend an insane amount of time - six to eight hours a day - listening to records and putting together lists for the show,\" says Peel from the hub of his record world, which is his East Anglian farmhouse's old garage. All the new releases come here, a large cardboard box making up a week's worth of the records sent. The room has a boyish, den-like feel; between the racks of records and CDs are football memorabilia, photographs of his wife, Sheila, and hot rod magazines from the 50s and 60s. Although the room feels chaotic and cramped, the records are very well ordered. The ones chosen to be played on future shows are recorded on a list, before being elevated from the boxes on the floor to the heights of the collection itself. Each is recorded on a card index. \"People say, 'Why don't you put the collection on computer?' But to put 25,776 LPs on to a computer would almost certainly take the rest of my life.\" Passing into another room that houses Peel's first 1,500 records, it dawns on me that a curator's mindset must be essential just to keep the collection at least reasonably accessible. This is where his four children, and their boyfriends and girlfriends, come in handy. \"Last summer I paid my daughter Flossie's then boyfriend to file my seven-inch singles, and he turned out to be the best filer I ever had. Unfortunately he and Flossie broke up shortly afterwards. Young people have so little consideration. My son William did that lot of CDs,\" says Peel, pointing to a rack, \"and got paid prodigious sums of money to do so, but he took all summer - he's naturally an extremely indolent boy. He seems to have no grasp of the alphabet, either.\" Some men have garden sheds to potter about in and get away from the wife; Peel has his two outhouses of records. \"I'll come in here to find something, and almost always find something else that I've completely forgotten about. It's a great stress-reliever.\" Peel mulls over a 45 by Wild Willy Barrett, an eccentric hippie chiefly famed for his collaboration with 70s pub rocker John Otway. The record collector's mind is at work here - revelling in the obscure, celebrating the authentic, and finding release in a three-minute song. Peel has been a DJ since 1963, working in the US for a number of radio stations before joining Radio 1 from its birth in 1968. He has the freedom to play what he likes, and what tends to make it through is anything that fulfils a degree of honesty, be that a scratchy old reggae 45 or the latest student union indie favourite. A few records have moved beyond work into the realm of the intensely personal. \"I've got a clutch of about 20 records which I'll grab in an emergency, and which will go into the grave with me,\" Peel explains. They're all 45s, they're all impossibly obscure, and each one, says Peel, \"can almost always reduce me to tears\". Within this sacred box, there's a Jagger-Richards composition, I'd Rather Be Out with the Boys, by mid-1960s Manchester no-hit wonders the Toggery Five; and a great reggae take on Paul Simon's Richard Cory by Jamaican singer Yami Boro, who, not quite understanding the words of the song, called it Richer Cory. \"There's a reggae version of Whiter Shade of Pale which does the same thing,\" says Peel, \"but the lyrics of that song were complete bollocks anyway, so misinterpreting them just adds another dimension.\" There are also a number of heartbreaking early-70s soul ballads. In one, Stanley Winston's No More Ghettos in America, the singer's voice quivers before collapsing into feverish falsetto. \"This is the only record this guy made,\" Peel explains, just as Winston breaks down entirely. \"You hear somebody like Mick Hucknall described as a soul singer after his 25th LP. This guy made this one 45 and the first 30 seconds eclipses Hucknall's entire output.\" And each of these records tells a story in Peel's life - such as the R'n'B classic You'd Better Move On by Arthur Alexander. \"It was given to me by a girlfriend in Texas, and I think it was a hint. Her way of saying, 'Suit action to the title, fatboy.' \" A British institution, John Peel, like so many music lovers, is a sentimentalist at heart, a man who can live through his most valued vinyl finds. \"I'll play them all together one day,\" he says of his 20 moments of greatness, \"and then go mad.\"",

Which all sounds strangely sensible.</p> <p>Of course, Koog being Koog there was the usual boyish enthusiasm, despite half the press pack wearing black (and it wasn't because black is the new black on the Paris catwalks either).

The selection process involved an in-depth questionnaire, followed by a round of interviews, psychological tests and auditions.</p> <p>They entered the Big Brother house on Friday July 14. Over the next nine weeks, two contestants are nominated for eviction by their fellow housemates each week, with the public having the final say on who gets booted out in a phone poll that closes on Friday nights.

      "bodyText": "The basic Big Brother premise: 10 participants live together in a house that is under constant, 24-hours a day surveillance from TV cameras and webcams and in complete isolation from the outside world, for nine weeks. Each week the public votes out one contestant, with the last one left standing picking up the \u00a370,000 prize. The 10 contestants were selected from more than 40,000 applicants. The selection process involved an in-depth questionnaire, followed by a round of interviews, psychological tests and auditions. They entered the Big Brother house on Friday July 14. Over the next nine weeks, two contestants are nominated for eviction by their fellow housemates each week, with the public having the final say on who gets booted out in a phone poll that closes on Friday nights. In the final week, viewers will vote for one of the three remaining contestants, who will win the \u00a370,000 prize. Each participant was allowed to take in one suitcase of clothing and a small case of personal belongings, including books, cigarettes and photographs. Radios, TVs, clocks and watches are banned. The contestants must each week perform a task, which have so far included riding 1,200km on an exercise bike, sending a semaphore message and an assault course. They can win extra spending money if they complete them successfully. Otherwise, they must survive on a housekeeping budget of a about \u00a31.50 per person per day, along with basic provisions, which are replenished every two weeks. The inhabitants are only allowed into the storeroom where the provisions are kept for one hour each morning.",

      "body": "<p>Film and fashion have been flirting since before Charlie Chaplin first put a hat on, but this week the love affair reached a new high - one with a distinctly dodgy twist. First, Martin Scorsese revealed that, having tackled boxing, gambling and organised crime, his next project would deal with the most crooked business of them all - fashion - in a film about the Gucci family feud. And Guy Ritchie's latest film, Snatch, which hits cinema screens today, is sure to extend the mockney-mobster aesthetic pioneered by its predecessor, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This fashionable new look is seeping, with ever greater concentration, into the style sensibility of the average twentysomething British male. Not since James Dean slouched in Rebel Without a Cause has on-screen style made such an impact on our wardrobes. </p> <p>Gangster chic is arguably cinema's greatest contribution to men's fashion, and after decades of New York tough guys, Ritchie - himself seldom seen without his Alfred Dunhill cashmere coat - has shown that British men can wear it, too. And they love him for it. The current issue of the totemic lad mag Loaded, for example, describes Snatch as \"the crowning and probably final moment of gangster fashion\". Meanwhile, FHM devotes a dozen pages to the film's key characters in its fashion section. Inside you can read how the Savile Row tailor and unflagging self-publicist Ozwald Boateng provided bespoke costumes for Lock Stock's original cast of \"authentic\" tough guys. </p> <p>If that's not enough evidence of the film's fashionable influence, go out tonight and observe twentysomething males queuing up to be first to take in Ritchie's latest and note how the British gangster movie's essential accessories - shiny loafers, pressed shirts, glinting boxes of 20 B&amp;H - are influencing our nation's smart-casual sensibility. </p> <p>Never mind the fact that real east-end petty criminals prefer to go to work in grubby Air Maxes and lurid Puffa jackets; faux cockney-criminal chic lets you look: a) sharp, b) a little bit tasty, and c) like a proper geezer - and who can complain about that? </p> <p>In retrospect, this state of affairs is the logical conclusion of a succession of gangster looks that film-makers have brought us over the past decade. It began with the hugely influential Reservoir Dogs and the slimline white-shirt, black-tie outfits worn by its protagonists. The get-up offered a knowing nod to the seedy glamour of Sinatra's Rat Pack and showed a generation of formalwear-phobic young men that suits wouldn't necessarily make them look like accountants - or, worse, schoolboys. </p> <p>A raft of cheapo sub-Tarantino crime flicks experimented with variations on the same sartorial theme, while several British-made gangster films, before and after Lock, Stock, tried to give the suit a comparably iconic presence. For the average movie-going geezer, though, Brit gangster fashion was always a little bit outre and risque, and had too many echoes of mod and 60s flamboyance to make the leap from screen to high-street store; you could happily admire it and buy the poster, but you wouldn't want to emulate it through your wardrobe. What Ritchie has done is domesticate the gangster look, make it safe for the fashion-fearing modern man who thinks being seen in pinstripes is as emasculating as arriving at the pub with a pink poodle. </p> <p>Effecting this shift has been something of a triumph - which is precisely why it is so depressing. \"I reckon if you get too interested in clothes, it all starts getting a bit fruity.\" That's the enlightened line Ritchie takes in September's FHM. You might have thought that his settling down with the most audacious, fashion-friendly pop star of the last 20 years would have broadened his style horizons, but you'd be wrong. \"Frankly,\" he continues, Madonna \"would have me dressed up like a poof if she could\". The godfather of Brit gangster chic sounds like an uptight estate agent after a few too many at the cricket club - a million miles from the iconic movie gangsters of the past. </p> <p>In Scorsese's Casino, Robert De Niro may have been hard as nails, but that didn't stop him wearing Dame Edna sunglasses and primary-coloured pimp suits. Even the macho supermen of 70s blaxploitation flicks such as Black Caesar found the time to invest in some decidedly \"fruity\" ruffled shirts and velvet jackets. Movie gangsters of old strutted like peacocks and preened themselves like poodles; they pushed the fashion envelope just as they tested the farthest limits of the law. They had a fatalistic, forbidden glamour. These days, we have to make do with geezerdom instead. </p> <p>Thankfully, there is a glimmer of hope for those of us bored silly by the nightclub bouncer-meets-monied-football hooligan look of gangster chic and, more importantly, its trickle-down effect on British menswear in general. The cultural swing back to modern tailoring - something often touted in recent times - is finally gathering some real momentum. Richard James and Gieves &amp; Hawkes, both purveyors of finely crafted, grown-up menswear, have just opened flagship, central-London stores and won acres of approving magazine coverage by doing so. Burberry, too, is enjoying a new wave of interest in its classic cuts. And a cover story in the latest issue of money magazine Forbes Global heralds the renaissance of \"dressing down in style\", arguing that the demise of the suit as a workplace uniform, combined with a growing awareness among men of the potential for elegance and individuality offered by a properly made two-piece signals a shift in style choices in the west. If that trend expands, it means a new dawn in fashion for men who go to a tailor with confidence, rather than those who need to buy their self-assurance and masculine credentials off the shelf. It's about time. </p> <p>In 1986, Madonna recorded a song called White Heat, a tribute to James Cagney in the 1949 gangster classic of the same name. The chances of her recording a comparable tribute to the verve and panache of her husband's leading men - say, Vinnie \"You're the Bollocks, Innit\" Jones - look decidedly slim. And on that note, what's the likelihood of Brit gangster chic going down in the histories of timeless screen style? As Al Pacino said in Donnie Brasco - slumped on the flock sofa in a hideous tracksuit, but still knocking the style spots off the Snatch mob - fugedaboutit.</p>",

Keegan also starts with Gareth Barry at left-back, believing the time has come for the 19-year-old to take a step up.</p> <p>\"His training has been fantastic but in many ways the big test is what you do on the pitch,\" Keegan said. \"I think he will take it in his stride. He's a great user of the ball and doesn't get flustered and I think that is a major, major plus at international level.\" </p> <p>Up front Keegan will play Manchester United's Andy Cole as a lone striker ahead of Paul Scholes. There is no place for Michael Owen, much to the Liverpool striker's disappointment.</p> <p>\"I've talked with Michael and he's fine about it - he's a very mature lad - but obviously he's disappointed,\" said Keegan. \"His form has been very good but I wanted to try playing one-up and one-off. Andy Cole has become very adaptable, we did play like that at Newcastle and the Beardsley-Cole partnership was tremendously difficult to play against.\"</p> <p>In midfield Dennis Wise will play in a holding role, David Beckham will join him in the centre with Darren Anderton playing on the right and Nick Barmby filling the problem position on the left. </p> <p>Keegan added: \"Looking at the French, the way they play, I thought this was best. We're playing the very best here and trying to get the balance right.\" </p> <p>Keegan insisted his selection for the friendly at Stade de France did not rule out anyone for the first World Cup qualifier against Germany next month. He said: \"I know what Paul Ince can do I know what Michael Owen can do and they will come back into contention for the Germany game - there's no doubt about that.\"</p> <p>Keegan also had comforting words for Phil Neville, who conceded the penalty which ended England's Euro 2000 hopes against Romania.</p> <p>\"Phil's a genuine boy,\" he said. \"He does as he's told and that's why he's still in the squad. I still believe very much in him, he's still one of my squad.\" </p> <p>Keegan then went on to insist England that must produce a \"step forward\" in tomorrow's game.</p> <p>\"I want a good performance, a step up that makes the players feel they've taken a step forward,\" he said. \"We are not going to play this quality in our World Cup qualifying group, with no disrespect to the teams we'll play then.\"</p> <p>\"Results help you. They help me and the players. I want to get the players back into believing, as we did before Euro 2000. They need to get that belief back into themselves again. </p> <p>\"But the down side is that this is a game where you can lose some self belief. But as long as we do better than we did in Euro 2000 it will set us up nicely.\" </p> <p>England team to face France in Paris tomorrow: Seaman; Barry, Adams (captain), Keown, Campbell; Barmby, Wise, Beckham, Anderton; Scholes; Cole.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kevin Keegan has announced a defensive-looking side for tomorrow's match with France. England will play a 4-4-1-1 line-up with Martin Keown and Tony Adams in central defence and Sol Campbell at right back. Keegan also starts with Gareth Barry at left-back, believing the time has come for the 19-year-old to take a step up. \"His training has been fantastic but in many ways the big test is what you do on the pitch,\" Keegan said. \"I think he will take it in his stride. He's a great user of the ball and doesn't get flustered and I think that is a major, major plus at international level.\" Up front Keegan will play Manchester United's Andy Cole as a lone striker ahead of Paul Scholes. There is no place for Michael Owen, much to the Liverpool striker's disappointment. \"I've talked with Michael and he's fine about it - he's a very mature lad - but obviously he's disappointed,\" said Keegan. \"His form has been very good but I wanted to try playing one-up and one-off. Andy Cole has become very adaptable, we did play like that at Newcastle and the Beardsley-Cole partnership was tremendously difficult to play against.\" In midfield Dennis Wise will play in a holding role, David Beckham will join him in the centre with Darren Anderton playing on the right and Nick Barmby filling the problem position on the left. Keegan added: \"Looking at the French, the way they play, I thought this was best. We're playing the very best here and trying to get the balance right.\" Keegan insisted his selection for the friendly at Stade de France did not rule out anyone for the first World Cup qualifier against Germany next month. He said: \"I know what Paul Ince can do I know what Michael Owen can do and they will come back into contention for the Germany game - there's no doubt about that.\" Keegan also had comforting words for Phil Neville, who conceded the penalty which ended England's Euro 2000 hopes against Romania. \"Phil's a genuine boy,\" he said. \"He does as he's told and that's why he's still in the squad. I still believe very much in him, he's still one of my squad.\" Keegan then went on to insist England that must produce a \"step forward\" in tomorrow's game. \"I want a good performance, a step up that makes the players feel they've taken a step forward,\" he said. \"We are not going to play this quality in our World Cup qualifying group, with no disrespect to the teams we'll play then.\" \"Results help you. They help me and the players. I want to get the players back into believing, as we did before Euro 2000. They need to get that belief back into themselves again. \"But the down side is that this is a game where you can lose some self belief. But as long as we do better than we did in Euro 2000 it will set us up nicely.\" England team to face France in Paris tomorrow: Seaman; Barry, Adams (captain), Keown, Campbell; Barmby, Wise, Beckham, Anderton; Scholes; Cole.",

There is, however, an upside to all this. What the Channel 4 kids also demonstrate is far less inhibition than earlier generations, much greater openness and - yes - more tolerance. And perhaps blandness is a price worth paying for that.

In the week from Friday 18 - after Bateman was evicted from the house, faced the media for the first time and sold his story to the Sun (ironically, given its campaign) - the number of Big Brother stories rocketed to 130. The weekly telephone vote to decide which contestant is evicted has also proved popular. For the third eviction, when Caroline O'Shea left the house on Friday August 18, more than 1.4m people voted.",

The release, disseminated by Internet Wire, an online public relations service, announced falsely that the company's chief executive had resigned, that it expected to lose money in the next quarter and that it had been forced by regulators to restate 1998 and 1999 earnings. </p> <p>The report was picked up by Dow Jones and Bloomberg news wires and the share price of the company sank. </p> <p>Stock market watchdogs such as the securities and exchange commission immediately launched an investigation, as did the FBI and US attorney's office.

      "bodyText": "The FBI yesterday arrested a man in connection with a bogus online news release which last week wiped $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) from the stock market value of Emulex, a Californian networking company. Last night, the US attorney's office was due to file criminal charges alleging that the man made $250,000 from the hoax. The suspect, understood to be a student in his 20s, was arrested at a house in Los Angeles. No further details were released, although the man was expected to be charged with fraudulent use of the internet. Shares in Emulex fell more than 50% last Friday after a bogus press release announced that it was in financial trouble. The release, disseminated by Internet Wire, an online public relations service, announced falsely that the company's chief executive had resigned, that it expected to lose money in the next quarter and that it had been forced by regulators to restate 1998 and 1999 earnings. The report was picked up by Dow Jones and Bloomberg news wires and the share price of the company sank. Stock market watchdogs such as the securities and exchange commission immediately launched an investigation, as did the FBI and US attorney's office. Civil action is also being considered. The rapid spread of the news and devastating effect on Emulex's stock price has prompted a review of operations by several news services and public relations firms. Many fear that the growth on online news has encouraged the race to deliver news at the expense of fact checking. The unnamed man is not the first to be held in custody for alleged internet fraud involving the financial markets in the US. A securities day trader was arrested in March for allegedly posting a bogus press release about Lucent Technologies.",

      "body": "<p>The final terrifying moments of Air France flight 4590 were revealed yesterday as French accident investigators released their preliminary report on July's Concorde crash outside Paris that killed 113 people.</p> <p>In a chilling transcript, the cockpit voice recorder graphically describes the final 77 seconds as the pilot, Christian Marty, struggles for control of the airliner, by now shooting flames from its left wing.</p> <p>At 2.43pm, shortly after take-off, the control tower warned: \"Concorde zero... 4590, you have flames. You have flames behind you.\"</p> <p>The crew, unable to retract the undercarriage and losing power fast, tried desperately to reach nearby Le Bourget airport. Seven seconds after the first message from air traffic control, the chief navigator confirmed: \"Breakdown engine two.\" Then, four seconds later: \"Cut engine two.\"</p> <p>As the aircraft tried to gain speed for an emergency landing, Mr Marty, in his last words, was heard to say: \"Too late... No time.\" Just after 2.44pm, the co-pilot exclaimed: \"Le Bourget, Le Bourget. Negative; we are trying Le Bourget.\" Sixteen seconds later, the recording ends. The plane ploughed into a hotel in the small town of Gonesse.</p> <p>The crash prompted Air France to ground its remaining Concordes immediately; British Airways followed suit three weeks later.</p> <p>The investigators from the French accident inquiry board, BEA, confirmed their earlier hypothesis that a burst tyre had set off the fatal chain of events that downed the New York-bound plane, killing all those on board - mainly German passengers and nine crew - and four people on the ground.</p> <p>\"The July 25 accident shows that the destruction of a tyre, an event that we cannot say will not recur, had catastrophic consequences... preventing the crew from rectifying the situation,\" the report said. \"The crew had no way of knowing about the nature of the fire, nor any means of fighting it.\"</p> <p>It confirmed that a metal strip, probably from another plane, had been found on the runway. \"It has holes in it and in some of these holes appear to be Cherry aeronautical rivets. This strip has not been identified as coming from Concorde,\" the report said.</p> <p>The BEA said last month that the 16-inch piece of metal had \"almost certainly\" gashed the Concorde's tyre, sending large chunks of rubber hurtling at tremendous speed into the plane's fuel tanks, contained in its delta-shaped wings, and sparking the blaze.</p> <p>\"At least one fuel tank was ruptured in one or more places, resulting in a substantial fuel leak. The leaking fuel caught light and a very violent fire ensued throughout the duration of the flight. Engine problems occurred in engine number two and, briefly, in engine number one,\" yesterday's interim report, released on the internet, said.</p> <p>Over the 25 years Concorde has been in commercial operation, there have been at least seven incidents in which one or more of the plane's tyres have burst, leading to punctures in the wings or fuel tanks.</p> <p>But in all of those incidents it was a piece of flying metal - from the undercarriage or water deflectors - that caused the damage, not tyre rubber itself. Safety efforts were therefore concentrated on strengthening all metal parts that could be broken off in a tyre burst, but not on protecting the wings.</p>",

In a chilling transcript, the cockpit voice recorder graphically describes the final 77 seconds as the pilot, Christian Marty, struggles for control of the airliner, by now shooting flames from its left wing. At 2.43pm, shortly after take-off, the control tower warned: \"Concorde zero... 4590, you have flames. You have flames behind you.\" The crew, unable to retract the undercarriage and losing power fast, tried desperately to reach nearby Le Bourget airport. Seven seconds after the first message from air traffic control, the chief navigator confirmed: \"Breakdown engine two.\" Then, four seconds later: \"Cut engine two.\" As the aircraft tried to gain speed for an emergency landing, Mr Marty, in his last words, was heard to say: \"Too late... No time.\" Just after 2.44pm, the co-pilot exclaimed: \"Le Bourget, Le Bourget. Negative; we are trying Le Bourget.\" Sixteen seconds later, the recording ends. The plane ploughed into a hotel in the small town of Gonesse. The crash prompted Air France to ground its remaining Concordes immediately; British Airways followed suit three weeks later. The investigators from the French accident inquiry board, BEA, confirmed their earlier hypothesis that a burst tyre had set off the fatal chain of events that downed the New York-bound plane, killing all those on board - mainly German passengers and nine crew - and four people on the ground. \"The July 25 accident shows that the destruction of a tyre, an event that we cannot say will not recur, had catastrophic consequences... preventing the crew from rectifying the situation,\" the report said. \"The crew had no way of knowing about the nature of the fire, nor any means of fighting it.\" It confirmed that a metal strip, probably from another plane, had been found on the runway. \"It has holes in it and in some of these holes appear to be Cherry aeronautical rivets. This strip has not been identified as coming from Concorde,\" the report said. The BEA said last month that the 16-inch piece of metal had \"almost certainly\" gashed the Concorde's tyre, sending large chunks of rubber hurtling at tremendous speed into the plane's fuel tanks, contained in its delta-shaped wings, and sparking the blaze. \"At least one fuel tank was ruptured in one or more places, resulting in a substantial fuel leak. The leaking fuel caught light and a very violent fire ensued throughout the duration of the flight. Engine problems occurred in engine number two and, briefly, in engine number one,\" yesterday's interim report, released on the internet, said. Over the 25 years Concorde has been in commercial operation, there have been at least seven incidents in which one or more of the plane's tyres have burst, leading to punctures in the wings or fuel tanks. But in all of those incidents it was a piece of flying metal - from the undercarriage or water deflectors - that caused the damage, not tyre rubber itself. Safety efforts were therefore concentrated on strengthening all metal parts that could be broken off in a tyre burst, but not on protecting the wings.",

      "body": "<p>There are things I remember about childhood Sunday visits to my paternal grandma that I can still only see from the waist-high perspective of a six-year-old. The bottle of Robinson's lemon barley water in the cupboard under the drawer with the old tennis balls I played with on the drive. A copy of the Beano that tradition dictated would be \"hidden\" under the middle cushion of the coffee-coloured sofa. And the Pyrex jug, opaque with age and scratches, holding creamy Yorkshire pudding batter, standing beside the sprouts (already cooked half to death) on top of the stove. </p> <p>Grandma was the queen of Yorkshire pudding-making and understandably proud. By contrast, my mother's tasted good but they always turned upside-down in their tins so they ended up looking like dumplings and there was no hole into which to pour your gravy. </p> <p>In retrospect, I can see that this pleased grandma immeasurably: the secret of the successful Yorkshire pudding was passed down from generation to generation, mother to daughter, and so my grandmother was able to assume a proprietorial superiority over her daughter-in-law. Just as well, then, that she is no longer around. She would be appalled - and no doubt wickedly delighted - at my utter ineptitude when faced with the task of producing anything approaching an edible Yorkshire pudding. </p> <p>I tried to make Yorkshire pudding last weekend and it was a disaster. One hundred phone calls home and fevered consultations with every recipe book on the kitchen shelf could not help me mix the batter to the consistency I recollected from grandma's kitchen. But I did get some things right. The roast beef was resting gracefully on top of the oven and the fat smoking in the tins when I poured in the mixture. Not enough of the mixture, as it turned out. I squatted on the floor and peered excitedly through the oven door, the better to observe the small miracle of the rising of the batter. Slowly, it coloured around the edges to a pale gold. Then, as I watched expectantly, each would-be pudding frazzled within seconds to a brittle, blackened disc. And that was that. </p> <p>Which got me thinking that, in this ready-cooked age, there might be a danger of the ability to make such an irreplaceable and delicious part of our culinary heritage as Yorkshire pudding dying out. When my mother was my age - 26 - she had a one-year-old daughter and had been cooking a weekly family roast with all its accoutrements for the past four years. </p> <p>I, on the other hand, have spent the past four years getting out of bed late at the weekend and rustling up bacon sarnies. In any given six months I eat more restaurant dinners than my parents have enjoyed in their entire lives. I practically have a degree in ordering from Indian takeaways. Of course, I cook too, but it tends to be \"assemblage\" food, hastily thrown together when I arrive home at 8.30pm after a depleting slog across London on the Tube. Pan-fried salmon steaks; caesar salad fresh from its cellophane bag; spaghetti alla puttanesca; carpaccio of beef and warm potato salad; marinated chicken kebabs ... this is what my generation mean by cooking. No one, repeat no one, of my age and acquaintance has ever even tried to make a Yorkshire pudding. </p> <p>I first began to fear for the future of the Yorkshire pudding when I ordered it at the Mirabelle, Marco Pierre White's elegant London restaurant. Marco Pierre White's fiery brusqueness and his Yorkshire pedigree are well-documented. So it seems fair to suppose that he, of all people, would not struggle to make a fine pudding. For, as Jennifer Stead writes in her essay Yorkshire Pudding and Parkin: \"The fact that they require spanking-hot fat, explosions as the batter hits it, fierce heat, and crisp results, may explain why it has often been said that only Yorkshire folk - those possessing the Yorkshire temperament - can make a true Yorkshire pudding.\" </p> <p>Alas, the Mirabelle's Yorkshire pudding was a grave disappointment. Its first sin was to come on the plate alongside the meat and vegetables. Sacrilege! The whole point of Yorkshire pudding when it was originally made in the 18th century was that it was a cheap way of taking the edge off hearty appetites before they fell to devouring the meat. It also tastes better that way. </p> <p>Jesiah Oakroyd, in JB Priestley's The Good Companions, puts it best: \"A Yorkshire pudding is eaten by itsen and not mixed up wi' meat and potaters, all in a mush.\" Even worse, the Mirabelle's Yorkshire pudding was yellowy and rich-tasting, as if extra eggs and extra milk had been used. Someone in the kitchen seemed to be trying to spruce up a centuries-old pauper's recipe to make it more appealing to toffs. And it was as pale and soft as they are. What folly! As Jesiah explains: \"If you've mixed right and your oven's hot, pudding'll come out as light as a feather, crisp and brarn, just a top and a bottom, you might say, wi' none o' this custardy stuff in t'middle.\" Quite obviously the Mirabelle's designer version will do nothing to preserve our Yorkshire pudding heritage. Still, I optimistically put it down to the Mirabelle being rather an effete, southern sort of place. </p> <p>Then, the other week, returning to my favourite Leeds pub at the start of the football season, I ordered Yorkshire pudding as I always do. How I looked forward to its arrival, slopped over with onion gravy, almost burned on top and just-soft on the underbelly. But a stealing dread set in when I saw that it had trebled in price since I last ate it and that it was chalked up with a range of four fillings. It had stopped being an ordinary Yorkshire meal and become an olde pubbe gimmick. My worst fears were realised when the plate was set before me. It wasn't properly cooked. Its pale and doughy bottom filled most of the plate. I couldn't eat it. </p> <p>But if I, a true-born Yorkshire woman, and Marco Pierre White, a trueborn Yorkshire chef, and the Whitelocks pub in Leeds cannot make a decent Yorkshire pudding, then who can? </p> <p>It is time to go back to basics. Early Yorkshire puddings were baked underneath the spit-roast and drenched in the rich juices that fell from the cooking meat. They were also made in a vast rectangular tin and cut into squares to be served. The batter is made from a milk, water, eggs and flour (no one should be tempted to replace water with luxurious milk). It goes without saying that a northern recipe must be used. (For what would a southerner know? I have even heard of some who fondly imagines that Yorkshire pudding is always served with jam.) Even then don't expect it to be easy. Prise a recipe from any northerner and you will find it full of words like \"by guesswork\" and \"you just know\" and \"when it's ready\". Not very helpful. </p> <p>My grandmother's recipe is no more obliging. She used one heaped tablespoon of plain flour per person, plus one extra, and one egg per person (quite generous on the eggs, this recipe). Put the flour into a bowl or jug and stir in a little salt. Make a well in the flour and crack in the eggs. With a fork gradually beat in the eggs, slowly gathering up more flour from the sides and bottom of the bowl. When the mixture is smooth slowly beat in \"some\" milk and \"a little\" water (I told you it wouldn't be precise) until the batter achieves the \"right\" consistency. </p> <p>The right consistency is when it just coats the back of a spoon. Beat hard for five minutes. Now leave the batter to stand for a good half hour at least. When you've done this you might find it needs a little more liquid (a little more guesswork required here). Next skim the fat, or beef dripping, from the juices that have collected round your roast and use it to grease the Yorkshire pudding tins. Put the tins on the top shelf of a belting hot oven until the fat is really smoking hot. Pour in the batter, pop them in the oven \"until they're ready\". </p> <p>If all this still sounds like too much trouble, and if you really have to, the supermarket shelves are piled with ready-made versions - testament to the fact that we like to eat but cannot make Yorkshire puddings. The ubiquitous Aunt Bessie's simply requires a little reheating. Sainsbury's own-brand ones come, uncooked and frozen, in individual little foil saucers, and you have the pleasure of watching them puff up into perfectly shaped puddings in the oven. And I don't want to be too complimentary but they don't taste bad either. Good enough, at least, for southerners.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Not since Saatchi &amp; Saatchi launched its ill-fated bid for Midland Bank has the advertising industry been seen to embrace consolidation so enthusiastically. Having lagged behind the companies they serve for more than a decade, ad agencies have in the past year rushed to buy, or be bought, in an often bewilderingly rapid feeding frenzy. </p> <p>This activity is a belated mirroring of what has been happening among their multinational clients. As global industries consolidate, they are looking increasingly for a single company that will cater for all of their ad requirements worldwide. It means there are fewer, but much larger and more lucrative, ad accounts in play, so smaller agencies will find it more difficult to survive as global clients seek to work with the biggest global agencies.</p> <p>According to Paul Richards, a media analyst at stockbroking firm WestLB Panmure, the other major factor behind the drive to consolidate is a desire for economies of scale. \"Each of the big groups wants to have two, maybe even three, global ad agencies. It's not just ad agencies - economies of scale are particularly important to media buying agencies. And there's a whole range of below-the-line activities - healthcare, PR, direct marketing - that clients now expect their agencies to offer.\"</p> <p>But until recently, ad industry efforts to consolidate have been severely hampered by conflicting client interest. Advertisers do not like to use agencies that work for rivals in their sector, just as they rarely employ professional advisers who work for direct competitors. A proposed merger between the French group Publicis and Young &amp; Rubicam of the US was scuppered recently when Y&amp;R's biggest client, Ford, objected on the grounds that Publicis handles ads for rival car manufacturer Renault.</p> <p>Perhaps the most notorious example is Procter &amp; Gamble. As the world's biggest advertiser, it wields enormous power over its agencies. Until recently, P&amp;G refused to allow its four main agency networks - Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Grey Advertising, Leo Burnett and MacManus - to belong to the same holding company as an agency handling competitor's work. The most extreme illustration of P&amp;G's draconian rules came when Saatchi &amp; Saatchi demerged from Cordiant Communications in 1997 because its status as a P&amp;G roster agency meant Bates Worldwide - Cordiant's other agency network - could not pitch for any household product advertisers.</p> <p>But early last year P&amp;G, realising that its rules meant it no longer had the world's biggest and most powerful agencies on its roster, let it be known quietly that any moves towards expansion would be looked on favourably.

Last November, the two of them linked up with Japan's largest ad agency, Dentsu, to form the oddly-named B Com3 (according to its founders, the name is derived from \"beacon\").

But in June Publicis, having lost out on a deal with Y&amp;R, surprised the industry by launching a $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) friendly takeover of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. The move created the world's fifth-largest ad company, with substantial media buying interests in the form of Publicis' Optimedia and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's 50% stake in Zenith Media.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, Publicis scored a coup when it bought the privately-owned US ad hot shop Fallon McElligott - known for its award-winning creative work.

The $4.7bn (\u00a33.2bn) deal meant WPP leapfrogged its two US rivals, Omnicom and IPG, to become the biggest ad services company in the world.

Cordiant executives are thought to be holding out for the \u00a31.2bn Publicis paid for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - a company of a similar size. The group is also thought to have held talks with IPG, which has been seeking a major acquisition since its attempts to buy MacManus failed last year.

      "bodyText": "Not since Saatchi &amp; Saatchi launched its ill-fated bid for Midland Bank has the advertising industry been seen to embrace consolidation so enthusiastically. Having lagged behind the companies they serve for more than a decade, ad agencies have in the past year rushed to buy, or be bought, in an often bewilderingly rapid feeding frenzy. This activity is a belated mirroring of what has been happening among their multinational clients. As global industries consolidate, they are looking increasingly for a single company that will cater for all of their ad requirements worldwide. It means there are fewer, but much larger and more lucrative, ad accounts in play, so smaller agencies will find it more difficult to survive as global clients seek to work with the biggest global agencies. According to Paul Richards, a media analyst at stockbroking firm WestLB Panmure, the other major factor behind the drive to consolidate is a desire for economies of scale. \"Each of the big groups wants to have two, maybe even three, global ad agencies. It's not just ad agencies - economies of scale are particularly important to media buying agencies. And there's a whole range of below-the-line activities - healthcare, PR, direct marketing - that clients now expect their agencies to offer.\" But until recently, ad industry efforts to consolidate have been severely hampered by conflicting client interest. Advertisers do not like to use agencies that work for rivals in their sector, just as they rarely employ professional advisers who work for direct competitors. A proposed merger between the French group Publicis and Young &amp; Rubicam of the US was scuppered recently when Y&amp;R's biggest client, Ford, objected on the grounds that Publicis handles ads for rival car manufacturer Renault. Perhaps the most notorious example is Procter &amp; Gamble. As the world's biggest advertiser, it wields enormous power over its agencies. Until recently, P&amp;G refused to allow its four main agency networks - Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Grey Advertising, Leo Burnett and MacManus - to belong to the same holding company as an agency handling competitor's work. The most extreme illustration of P&amp;G's draconian rules came when Saatchi &amp; Saatchi demerged from Cordiant Communications in 1997 because its status as a P&amp;G roster agency meant Bates Worldwide - Cordiant's other agency network - could not pitch for any household product advertisers. But early last year P&amp;G, realising that its rules meant it no longer had the world's biggest and most powerful agencies on its roster, let it be known quietly that any moves towards expansion would be looked on favourably. This has acted as a catalyst to industry consolidation and, in the past year alone, the balance of power has changed dramatically. The first P&amp;G agencies to oblige were the US groups MacManus (owner of the UK's D'Arcy and IMP agencies) and Leo Burnett, which owns the UK agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty. Last November, the two of them linked up with Japan's largest ad agency, Dentsu, to form the oddly-named B Com3 (according to its founders, the name is derived from \"beacon\"). B Com3 is now the world's fourth-largest ad organisation, behind Britain's WPP and Omnicom and IPG of the US, and it is expected to use its forthcoming flotation to bankroll further acquisitions. It was assumed that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi would follow suit and merge with Grey Advertising, which is publicly quoted but controlled by its 73-year-old chairman and chief executive, Ed Meyer. But in June Publicis, having lost out on a deal with Y&amp;R, surprised the industry by launching a $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) friendly takeover of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.

      "byline": "Claire Cozens",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>One of the more wildly inaccurate predictions about the internet was that it would spell the end of the advertising industry as we know it. Digital communications would, so the theory went, render obsolete all those lumbering old media forms of promoting your brand. </p> <p>Well, anyone who believed that must be feeling pretty stupid now. From Amazon.com and Egg.com to Jungle.com and Lastminute.com, the e-commerce industry is ploughing millions into advertising agencies' coffers in an attempt to build up all-important brand recognition. And while the popularity of the internet as an advertising medium is growing rapidly, most of the new e-brands are spending the bulk of their venture capitalist millions on good old-fashioned press, poster and television advertising. </p> <p>For any remaining doubters, the moment of truth came when the US networks unveiled their advertising schedules for last autumn's Super Bowl, the advertiser's Holy Grail. Almost half the 30-odd companies that had bought airtime at a rate of around $2m (\u00a31.3m) for a 30-second commercial had dot.com at the end of their names. </p> <p>So far, then, the internet has been just about the biggest gravy train the advertising industry could have hoped for, with multi-million-pound advertisers falling into their laps. But how well prepared are advertising agencies for the digital age? And with a new breed of digital specialists snapping at their heels, are agencies being too complacent about their hold on their clients' marketing budgets? </p> <p>While most industry observers agree that the advertising industry was slow off the mark, many of the top 10 UK advertising and media buying agencies now have a specialist digital division. But the fact that the function of these divisions varies wildly from one agency to the next shows how confused the advertising industry remains about its precise function in the digital age. </p> <p>In some agencies, such as WCRS, they have a fairly traditional role, handling advertising campaigns for the main agency's IT and e-commerce clients and creating internet advertising campaigns for its mainstream clients. </p> <p>One agency, BMP DDB, has even opened a shop dedicated to creating interactive television ads for its clients - although the number of interactive ads that have run in the UK so far could be counted on the fingers of one hand. </p> <p>Other agencies, though, have been more ambitious. eMC Saatchi, an offshoot of the Saatchi brothers' agency, M&amp;C Saatchi, is billed as a digital consultancy, and offers strategic advice to clients about how they should be using digital media. J. Walter Thompson offers a similar service. </p> <p>But many advertising agencies - including the UK market leader, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO - still have no such specialist operation. The argument these agencies use is that advertising agencies should stick to what they do best, rather than trying to be jacks of all trades. They also believe that what the digital consultancies call 'new media solutions' should be integrated into the main agency, rather than hived off into a separate division where clients may not have access to the best creative talent. </p> <p>Andrew Robertson, chief executive of AMV, points out that no two interactive units are doing the same thing. \"The internet impacts to some degree on everything Abbott Mead Vickers is doing,\" he says. \"If this thing becomes as important as everyone is predicting it will, then the last thing in the world we would want to do is to take it out of the main agency.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the more wildly inaccurate predictions about the internet was that it would spell the end of the advertising industry as we know it. Digital communications would, so the theory went, render obsolete all those lumbering old media forms of promoting your brand. Well, anyone who believed that must be feeling pretty stupid now. From Amazon.com and Egg.com to Jungle.com and Lastminute.com, the e-commerce industry is ploughing millions into advertising agencies' coffers in an attempt to build up all-important brand recognition. And while the popularity of the internet as an advertising medium is growing rapidly, most of the new e-brands are spending the bulk of their venture capitalist millions on good old-fashioned press, poster and television advertising. For any remaining doubters, the moment of truth came when the US networks unveiled their advertising schedules for last autumn's Super Bowl, the advertiser's Holy Grail. Almost half the 30-odd companies that had bought airtime at a rate of around $2m (\u00a31.3m) for a 30-second commercial had dot.com at the end of their names. So far, then, the internet has been just about the biggest gravy train the advertising industry could have hoped for, with multi-million-pound advertisers falling into their laps. But how well prepared are advertising agencies for the digital age? And with a new breed of digital specialists snapping at their heels, are agencies being too complacent about their hold on their clients' marketing budgets? While most industry observers agree that the advertising industry was slow off the mark, many of the top 10 UK advertising and media buying agencies now have a specialist digital division. But the fact that the function of these divisions varies wildly from one agency to the next shows how confused the advertising industry remains about its precise function in the digital age. In some agencies, such as WCRS, they have a fairly traditional role, handling advertising campaigns for the main agency's IT and e-commerce clients and creating internet advertising campaigns for its mainstream clients. One agency, BMP DDB, has even opened a shop dedicated to creating interactive television ads for its clients - although the number of interactive ads that have run in the UK so far could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Other agencies, though, have been more ambitious. eMC Saatchi, an offshoot of the Saatchi brothers' agency, M&amp;C Saatchi, is billed as a digital consultancy, and offers strategic advice to clients about how they should be using digital media. J. Walter Thompson offers a similar service. But many advertising agencies - including the UK market leader, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO - still have no such specialist operation. The argument these agencies use is that advertising agencies should stick to what they do best, rather than trying to be jacks of all trades. They also believe that what the digital consultancies call 'new media solutions' should be integrated into the main agency, rather than hived off into a separate division where clients may not have access to the best creative talent. Andrew Robertson, chief executive of AMV, points out that no two interactive units are doing the same thing. \"The internet impacts to some degree on everything Abbott Mead Vickers is doing,\" he says. \"If this thing becomes as important as everyone is predicting it will, then the last thing in the world we would want to do is to take it out of the main agency.\"",

This strip has not been identified as coming from Concorde.\" Cherry rivets are not used in the construction of Concorde aircraft.</p> <p>The BEA said that a 16-inch (41-cm) piece of metal found on the runway shoulder gashed the tyre. Debris from the tyre travelling at a high velocity then probably gouged the fuel tanks, which are contained in Concorde's delta-shaped wings.</p> <p>A photograph of a badly damaged tyre showed a 8.8-lb (4-kg) tyre fragment with a gash of almost 13 inches (33cm).</p> <p>The report said that no conclusions or analysis could be drawn from the investigation so far. A BEA spokesperson said that \"certain points could evolve\" and the final report was not due to be published for at least another year.</p> <p>The report said that on takeoff from runway 26 at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, the front tyre of the left under carriage became damaged and tyre fragments were projected under the fuselage.</p> <p>A substantial fire broke out under the left wing. Engine problems occurred in engine number 2, and briefly in engine number 1. The aircraft was unable to gain altitude or accelerate, and the crew were unable to retract the landing gear.</p> <p>At a speed of 230mph and an altitude of 200 feet (61m), the ill-fated aircraft flew for approximately one minute, as the pilot struggled to set it on a course for Le Bourget airport, on the outskirts of Paris. But engine number 1 stopped and the aircraft crashed into a hotel at Gonesse after flying for one minute.</p> <p>The damage sequence has not yet been fully established. But at least one fuel tank was ruptured in one or more places, resulting in a substantial fuel leak; the leaking fuel caught light and a violent fire raged throughout the duration of the flight.</p> <p>The report absolves the crew from any blame. It said that they had no way of knowing about the nature of the fire, nor any means of fighting it.</p> <p>According to the investigators, experience has shown that a tyre blow out during taxiing, landing and takeoff is not an improbable event, even on Concorde, and that such an event is capable of causing structural and system damage.</p> <p>But the report emphasised that a blow out of this kind has never before led to a fuel fire.</p> <p>Phil Butterworth-Hayes, editor of Jane's Aircraft Component Manufacturers, said that the issue was now one for the safety authorities, including Britain's regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</p> <p>He declared: \"The headache for the CAA and the French authorities is they have to work out what is an acceptable risk. Nobody really knows for sure what tests will make Concorde safe. It is a question of educated guesswork.\"</p> <p>He said that three modifications could be made to Concorde, which could take up to nine months to put in place. Protective coverings could be added to the tyres and to the fuel tanks, and more intensive checks could be ordered to ensure that runways were clear of debris.</p> <p>Modifications were very difficult, he said, because Concorde was unlike other aircraft. If something was changed, the the weight would alter, affecting the aircraft's range. \"You just cannot just bash a bit of metal on to it,\" said Mr Butterworth-Hayes.</p>",

A photograph of a badly damaged tyre showed a 8.8-lb (4-kg) tyre fragment with a gash of almost 13 inches (33cm). The report said that no conclusions or analysis could be drawn from the investigation so far. A BEA spokesperson said that \"certain points could evolve\" and the final report was not due to be published for at least another year. The report said that on takeoff from runway 26 at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, the front tyre of the left under carriage became damaged and tyre fragments were projected under the fuselage. A substantial fire broke out under the left wing. Engine problems occurred in engine number 2, and briefly in engine number 1. The aircraft was unable to gain altitude or accelerate, and the crew were unable to retract the landing gear. At a speed of 230mph and an altitude of 200 feet (61m), the ill-fated aircraft flew for approximately one minute, as the pilot struggled to set it on a course for Le Bourget airport, on the outskirts of Paris. But engine number 1 stopped and the aircraft crashed into a hotel at Gonesse after flying for one minute. The damage sequence has not yet been fully established. But at least one fuel tank was ruptured in one or more places, resulting in a substantial fuel leak; the leaking fuel caught light and a violent fire raged throughout the duration of the flight. The report absolves the crew from any blame. It said that they had no way of knowing about the nature of the fire, nor any means of fighting it. According to the investigators, experience has shown that a tyre blow out during taxiing, landing and takeoff is not an improbable event, even on Concorde, and that such an event is capable of causing structural and system damage. But the report emphasised that a blow out of this kind has never before led to a fuel fire. Phil Butterworth-Hayes, editor of Jane's Aircraft Component Manufacturers, said that the issue was now one for the safety authorities, including Britain's regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). He declared: \"The headache for the CAA and the French authorities is they have to work out what is an acceptable risk. Nobody really knows for sure what tests will make Concorde safe. It is a question of educated guesswork.\" He said that three modifications could be made to Concorde, which could take up to nine months to put in place. Protective coverings could be added to the tyres and to the fuel tanks, and more intensive checks could be ordered to ensure that runways were clear of debris. Modifications were very difficult, he said, because Concorde was unlike other aircraft. If something was changed, the the weight would alter, affecting the aircraft's range. \"You just cannot just bash a bit of metal on to it,\" said Mr Butterworth-Hayes.",

Failure to realise these aims damages market confidence in a company and makes the chief executive's position uncomfortable. There are a lot of considerations, but business is all about taking risks and in mergers the cost of failure and success is directly proportional. REASONS FOR MERGING 1) To improve market share by accessing new markets. 2) To acquire new brands or take control of competing products. 3) To improve the company's infrastructure, particularly in relation to IT or technology. 4) To reduce costs and boost efficiency. 5) In the interests of globalisation and to increase the company's international reach. MERGER TYPES There are three types of merger, although the time-scale to complete the deal, and the regulatory rules in each sector, may differ. Horizontal: This is when a company links up with another one that is at the same production level - for example, a car manufacturer merging with another car manufacturer. Vertical: This is when a company merges with another one that is at a different stage in the production cycle. A forward vertical merger is one stage ahead, such as a car manufacturer taking over a car hire company; a backward vertical merger might involve a manufacturer taking over a tyre factory. Conglomerate integration: This is when two companies with no apparent links merge. What you need for a merger: 1) Squads of lawyers: do not even think about going near a merger target without a team of lawyers to tell you what to do, guide you through regulation hell and stand in the corner looking as though they know better than you - which they will. 2) Loads of cash: lawyers are not cheap, and neither are cash takeovers. Also, a failed merger bid will knock millions of pounds off a company's stock market value. So line your pockets. 3) Lucky horseshoe: there are several committees and institutions waiting to pore over mergers or takeovers, and it is sometimes impossible to tell if they are going to block the deal.

It is hardly surprising, however, that the debate is somewhat one-sided: the government itself has taken the express decision not to put the facts of our membership of the euro before the British people, in a desperate attempt to avoid being presented as the government that wants to abolish the pound. Instead of extolling the benefits - if it believes they exist - of joining the euro, the government is reduced to attacking those who question the negative aspects. At the same time, it is presenting an open goal to its political opponents and their friends in the press. So, by criticising the media for not presenting the positive aspects of EU membership, Mr Vaz is in effect asking the press to put the case for an argument that ministers themselves are not prepared to make. It is an absurd position, and one that was rightly derided by Charles Moore, anti-euro editor of the Daily Telegraph. He told Radio 4's Today programme: \"The main argument is about British membership of the single currency, whether or not we abolish the pound. There are many people in favour of membership of the EU who are against abolishing the pound. This is constantly obscured by the government.\" In any case, it is hardly the responsibility of the media to do the government's job for it. \"Great newspapers ought to tell the truth and put the facts out before the British people. That's all we ask, a balanced, sensible debate,\" says Mr Vaz. Surely, that is also the responsibility of great governments?",

      "body": "<p><strong>An Unspeakable Betrayal: Selected Writings of Luis Bu\u00f1uel </strong> translated by Garrett White (California, 266 pp., \u00a317.50, 20 April, 0 520 20840 4 )<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502364043,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>\"Studio Vingt-Huit - high up a winding street of Montmartre, in the full blasphemy of a freezing Sunday; taxis arriving, friends greeting each other, an excitable afternoon audience.\" The description is Cyril Connolly's, the occasion a showing of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's first film, Un Chien andalou. The audience seemed baffled at the end, and some of its members were angry, unprepared no doubt for what Connolly called the \"destructive reverence\" of the film. \"With the impression of having witnessed some infinitely ancient horror, Saturn swallowing his sons, we made our way out into the cold of February 1929, that unique and dazzling cold.\"</p> <p>Connolly's sense of the horror of the work, and of its romance (\"Un Chien andalou brought out the grandeur of the conflict inherent in romantic love, the truth that the heart is made to be broken, and after it has mended, to be broken again\"), led him to ignore its farcical aspects, its echoes of Buster Keaton and its complementary truth that romantic love is as often as not a matter of violent grabs and dashes, a pantomime of lust wagging its human puppets. But his experience anticipated that of thousands of others. The first film we see by any major director usually makes a mark, but we don't always feel we have seen Saturn swallowing his sons. </p> <p>The first Bu\u00f1uel film seen by most people of my generation who were not film-club addicts was probably Viridiana (1961). After two Surrealist films made in France (Un Chien andalou and L'Age d'or, 1930), and an astonishing documentary made in Spain (Las Hurdes, 1932), Bu\u00f1uel's career was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. He spent some time in the United States, then in 1946 settled in Mexico, where he made 18 films, of which only Los Olvidados (1950) got any real notice. Viridiana was made in Spain under Franco, and caused a tremendous scandal. After that Bu\u00f1uel made one more film in Spain (Tristana, 1970), two more films in Mexico (The Exterminating Angel, 1962, Simon of the Desert, 1965), and six films in France (Diary of a Chambermaid, 1964, Belle de jour, 1966, The Milky Way, 1969, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, 1972, The Phantom of Liberty, 1974, That Obscure Object of Desire, 1977). </p> <p>Viridiana has a number of startling and now famous images - a small crucifix flicks open to become a menacing knife; riotous, feasting beggars compose themselves into a parody of Leonardo's Last Supper, a snatch of Handel's 'Hallelujah Chorus' blaring in the soundtrack - and a ferocious implied argument about charity. All charity which is less than infinite leaves the world unchanged, and what charity is not less than infinite? Yet the most memorable feature of Viridiana, I think, is not its imagery or its argument but the harsh, reckless intelligence behind it, its manifest intention to disturb us beyond repair. Bu\u00f1uel used to say in lectures and interviews that his films are designed to show us that we don't live in the best of worlds. They certainly do that, but the formulation is not strong enough. Whatever we think about the world we live in, Bu\u00f1uel wants to send us home from the cinema feeling rattled and uncomfortable. This feeling, mysteriously, is not incompatible with being highly amused, but then the very idea of amusement seems troubling. \"Viridiana, at heart, is a humorous film,\" Bu\u00f1uel says in a typescript published in An Unspeakable Betrayal, but immediately adds that the humour is \"corrosive\". </p> <p>A few months after seeing Viridiana for the first time, I was in Spain, and met a charming man, a doctor, who claimed to know Bu\u00f1uel intimately, and to have helped him recruit the beggars for that film. I can't remember whether I believed him or not. Probably I did. Bu\u00f1uel for me was as distant as Cervantes or Saint Teresa, and I didn't even know where he lived. Then I forgot about the encounter, except for thinking kindly of the doctor and Madrid whenever I saw Viridiana again, or when my mind turned to Spain. And with time I certainly ceased to believe in the story. The doctor was entitled to his fantasy, after all; Bu\u00f1uel was the kind of figure who attracted legends and anecdotes. Then some 13 years later I saw The Phantom of Liberty. </p> <p>Right at the beginning of the film a group of Spanish prisoners is led out to be shot by Napoleon's soldiers. They include Bu\u00f1uel himself, as a monk; Serge Silberman, Bu\u00f1uel's producer; and the writer Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn, an old friend of Bu\u00f1uel's. They also include the uncannily familiar figure of my old acquaintance the doctor, Bu\u00f1uel's pal Jos\u00e9-Luis Barros. It took me a while to place the recognised face, and of course I didn't fill in all the details even then. A few years later I met Bu\u00f1uel in Mexico. He was delighted when I told him the story - he loved coincidences - and thought it would have been even better if Barros and I had turned out to be long-lost twins, perhaps identified by a birthmark. I hang onto that moment in the cinema because when I saw the film and found the face I realised I had caught a piece of lost time. Not only Madrid and Dr Barros and an earlier self, but Viridiana as it felt when I first saw it: blasphemous, brilliant, ragged, indifferent to the preoccupations of unity and coherence which most aesthetics demand - Saturn swallowing a daughter. </p> <p>If I had been less devoted to the notion of the death of the author I might have got more out of my encounters with Bu\u00f1uel himself. But I'm not sure. He was so courtly and entertaining, so willing to treat me as a new-found friend rather than a nosy writer, that I had real difficulty in thinking about our conversations as material. Material for what? For the book about his films I was trying to write, or the biography I had no intention of writing? The anecdotes he told were the ones he usually told, often ones I'd already read somewhere: his stock of stories. He was a 78-year-old famous man, he had his best memories organised, he had shaped them into tales, and he was soon to put them in a book called My Last Breath (1982), which he wrote in collaboration with his scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re. </p> <p>Didn't I gather rich insights into the films? Some, but not as many as you might think. This was manifestly the Bu\u00f1uel who made Bu\u00f1uel's films, there were plenty of continuities between the mind I'd met in the work and the mind I was meeting over drinks. The author was fully alive in that sense, and discussing his films with Bu\u00f1uel was a delight. But I didn't understand the films a whole lot better for talking to him, and any language I might find for writing about the films was going to be quite different from the language in which I could describe him, if I was even going to try to describe him. A person is not a film, and films have all kinds of adventures once the director has finished editing them. \"I don't believe one's life can be confused with one's work,\" Bu\u00f1uel says in the book I've just mentioned. </p> <p>What I did get from meeting Bu\u00f1uel, apart from much pleasure and laughter, was a feeling for the kind of artist he was, the peculiar mixture of austerity and mischief he brought to the cinema. You can see this in the films as well, of course, but there is so much else in them, so much obsession and yearning, so much appetite for pain, so much unappeased theology. All this must have been in the person somewhere, certainly, but it wasn't in the person you met. He had trained himself, I believe, to save his nightmares for his movies. What was left in daily life was a curious mind and an imagination always playing with possibility, but above all his craft and his career, the sense of film as an art and a discipline, a kind of experiment in which even the wildest jokes took on a certain aspect of rigour or purity. </p> <p>I met Bu\u00f1uel in July 1978, through an old friend, Santiago Genov\u00e9s, a Mexican anthropologist. Santiago, born in Spain, always called Bu\u00f1uel Don Luis, and after a bit of practice, so did I. I saw him a number of times in company over the next three years, and I had many conversations with him in the late afternoons. The last time I saw him was in June 1981. I didn't go back to Mexico for a while after that, and he died in July 1983. </p> <p>First impressions. He is old, bent, has rather crooked teeth, large intelligent eyes behind heavy glasses. An amiable, mischievous grin resides almost constantly on his face. He is very deaf, but can hear if you speak loud and clear, although communication is always a little uncertain, apt to misfire or lose its sequence. A small terrier called Tristana trots in and sits on the sofa. Don Luis, the scourge of actors and actresses, can't get her to move or leave. \"I am a monk,\" he says, \"I don't go out.\" It's largely true. The world comes to him, insofar as he allows it to. But it doesn't come much or often. He says he feels old, that he was \"formidable\" between 40 and 60, and felt fine in his 60s. Now he can't remember the name of the pills he's supposed to take for his diabetes, he starts to do a sum and can't remember what he has just multiplied by what. He feels dizzy at times. He says all this with genuine impatience and distaste, but also with an energy which comes out as a kind of unshakable gaiety. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel likes some contemporary directors, but not many. American films, he says. Woody Allen. Stanley Kubrick. \"That film with those shots of the man's eye.\" \"A Clockwork Orange?\" \"That's the one.\" Nice thought, coming from the man whose film career began with the image of an eye slashed by a razor. Bu\u00f1uel tells me a Hitchcock story, which he tells again in My Last Breath. There is a dinner in Bu\u00f1uel's honour at George Cukor's house in Hollywood in 1972. Fifteen famous directors are there, including John Ford, Rouben Mamoulian, Robert Mulligan, George Stevens, Robert Wise, William Wyler, Billy Wilder. Hitchcock sits next to Bu\u00f1uel, says very little, then at one point puts an arm round his companion's shoulder and says with deep admiration: \"Bu\u00f1uel, that wooden leg in Tristana. That wooden leg.\"</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel and his wife Jeanne lived in a small and tidy house in the southern central part of Mexico City, the place Bu\u00f1uel called \"this metropolis without end\". Both had become Mexican citizens in 1949. The street was a quiet cul-de-sac off a busy thoroughfare; the house had a small enclosed garden. \"Come and see me when you like,\" Bu\u00f1uel would say, \"but telephone first to set up a time.\" I would telephone, talk to Jeanne, and ask if I could see Don Luis. She would consult him, and he would invariably say: \"How about tomorrow around five?\" So I learned not to call if I couldn't go the next day. </p> <p>Generally I would watch a film of his at the Mexican Cineteca and then drive over to his house. I would say, \"I saw El today, or Robinson Crusoe,\" or whatever I had seen, and he would say: \"Terrible film, the director should be shot.\" I would murmur in polite disagreement, and ask him a question about the work. One day I said I had very much liked a French film he had made in Corsica, Cela s'appelle l'Aurore (1955). \"Yes,\" he said. \"I liked it when I made it.\" He didn't care for technical queries, and I discovered that general questions, critics' questions, didn't interest him, that he didn't want to discuss ideas or meanings. But he would talk about all kinds of things, if you could get him started on the right sort of detail - the ostrich in close-up at the end of The Phantom of Liberty, say, the garrulous duel between Jansenist and Jesuit in The Milky Way. He even loved ideas. He just didn't like the idea of them. </p> <p>One day I didn't offer my polite disagreement. I had been to see his A Woman without Love (1951), a version of Maupassant's novel Pierre et Jean, a truly terrible film by any standards, without a single redeeming or even interesting moment, as far as I could see. In My Last Breath, Bu\u00f1uel was to say this was \"no doubt my worst film\", but I didn't then know that he thought that. A number of Bu\u00f1uel's Mexican works are jagged and uneven, but virtually all of them have luminous features, touches that reveal the quirky or reckless hand of the master. Not this one. I said I didn't think the director should be shot but the film was awful, and asked what happened.</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel nodded, remembering. Finally he said: \"I couldn't think of anything\" - \"No se me occuri\u00f3 nada,\" literally \"nothing occurred to me\". He couldn't think of anything? Yes, he knew the film was boring from the start but assumed something would occur to him while he was shooting, some gag or angle or twist that would liven it up. That was how he worked, and almost always something occurred to him. There is a little fable about art here. You plan carefully, and you leave room for inspiration, in fact you rely on its arrival. But then inspiration, always an uncertain dancing partner, fails to show up, and you just keep going and finish the job. Then you make another plan. </p> <p>I was then rather keen on the idea of Bu\u00f1uel as a permanent Surrealist, of Surrealism as a continuing state of mind, and so was slightly shocked to hear him place the movement so firmly in the past. \"When I was a Surrealist\", he said, and \"in the days of the Surrealists\" - as if the group was a club or a team you could join or leave. He was right, of course, Surrealism was always a thinner, more privileged form of revolt than it liked to imagine it was - or than I liked to imagine it was. The bourgeoisie revolting against the bourgeoisie, Bu\u00f1uel said in My Last Breath. But there is a continuing mentality, too, which has to do not with shock or rebellion but with resistance to settled or predictable meanings: resistance to interpretation itself, if by 'interpretation' we mean not just trying to make sense of things but succeeding in doing it. </p> <p>Early in our first conversation we spoke about That Obscure Object of Desire, then a recent film, which was to be Bu\u00f1uel's last. This work, notoriously, has two actresses playing a single role, that of the taunting, endlessly desired Conchita, the role played by Marlene Dietrich (on her own) when Sternberg made The Devil Is a Woman, his film based on the same novel. There is a single fictional character, with a name and a mother and a place in the plot, and indeed a single voice on the soundtrack, that of Carole Bouquet. On the screen, though, we see Carole Bouquet alternating with Angela Molina. They look quite different, although audience reactions to this trick have varied immensely: some people haven't noticed it, and some haven't been able to take their minds off it, and many have had reactions situated somewhere in between. The point, for most viewers, is to make meaning out of the alternation. The point for Bu\u00f1uel was to defeat meaning. There was to be nothing psychological about the switches, he said to me, no Jekyll and Hyde story, only random alternation. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel's films are full of touches like this, there to scramble old meanings, not to provide new ones, and they could have been fuller of them. Bu\u00f1uel himself was proud of the idea of the two actresses but was ready to agree that it was crazy - he had started shooting, in Paris and Madrid, with one actress, Maria Schneider, and when he fired her thought the production was over - but Serge Silberman, his producer, took to the suggestion instantly. Unlike Oscar Dancigers, the producer of Los Olvidados, who had persuaded Bu\u00f1uel to take a series of similar moves out of the film: a full symphony orchestra playing in a building under construction, a glossy top hat briefly glimpsed on a stove in a Mexico City hovel. </p> <p>Most viewers would miss these moments, Bu\u00f1uel thought, and those who saw them would wonder what they had seen, just as we wonder, in That Obscure Object of Desire, whether we have really seen two actresses or weirdly misremembered just one. Dancigers's view, which Bu\u00f1uel accepted in practice without agreeing to the principle, was that the director was ruining the film. \"I don't care if I ruin films,\" Bu\u00f1uel said. This could be a motto for him: when he is lucky, his films are the ruins of films he didn't want to make. </p> <p>My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at the Bu\u00f1uels' house in 1978. There were a number of guests, much festivity, champagne, many Spanish jokes. Everyone had a good time, and I had a small illumination. This orderly, good-humoured house, these kindly people: isn't there something odd here? Only what Bu\u00f1uel has taught us to find odd. We are the people who managed to have a meal together, unlike the characters in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. When the meal is over, we shall be able to leave (we were able to leave), unlike the characters in The Exterminating Angel. Bu\u00f1uel himself is not outside the world he criticises, he is part of it, and so are his friends and family. Social arrangements are foolish and apparently fragile, because they are so arbitrary and groundless. Everything about them could be different, and is different in other times and places. </p> <p>\"Everyone is a barbarian for someone,\" as a character says in The Phantom of Liberty: \"on est toujours le barbare de quelqu'un\". And yet it is because these arrangements are arbitrary and groundless that we have so little purchase on them, and they seem so strangely unchangeable. The radical instability of things in Bu\u00f1uel's films is a wish, an act of fictional defiance, the expression of a political and moral need. Their durability in reality is their discreet and remorseless excess of charm. Bu\u00f1uel's great subject is the intimate failure of the bourgeoisie to revolt against the bourgeoisie. </p> <p>Hence Bu\u00f1uel's fondness for heretics, and stories about heretics. Heretics are not atheists, outsiders, they are believers who believe something different, they are with us and not with us. That's why we have to persecute them, or why, if we are the heretics, we get persecuted. The Milky Way, Bu\u00f1uel said, could have been made about any form of heresy, artistic, scientific, sociological. He chose religious heresies because he happened to know something about them - because of his Jesuit education, he said. Bu\u00f1uel attended a school in Zaragoza that sounds at all points identical with the school Stephen Dedalus attends in Dublin in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</p> <p> There is something disingenuous, even mischievous, about this claim, since Bu\u00f1uel's religious preoccupations are clearly more firmly anchored than the remark suggests, more like a trauma than an option. But the intellectual reach of the idea is interesting, and says something about the intimacy of failed revolt in Bu\u00f1uel's works, from L'Age d'or through Los Olvidados, Nazar\u00edn, Viridiana, Tristana and The Phantom of Liberty. Heretics often suffer dreadfully because they are so close to the doctrine they dissent from. But then they are close to it. Even their dissent can be seen as a form of complicity, a failure to get outside the engulfing system. This is a revolt which can't escape its family of thought, which will always have been the secret friend of its worst enemy. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel was born in Calanda, near Teruel, in Spain, just over 100 years ago (22 February 1900), but he insisted that the place itself plunged him into an older time.\"My infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere\"; \"I had the good fortune of spending my childhood in the Middle Ages.\" One effect of this ancientness was that his films, after a certain point, stopped ageing, since they so fluently mingled contemporary violence, drugs, high-tech killers, up-to-date political jokes with much older customs. When a car hits a tree in The Milky Way, a voice comes out of the car radio preaching a sermon on the pains of hell. The text is from a work by Fray Luis de Granada, a medieval mystic. The voice is Bu\u00f1uel's. Although Bu\u00f1uel thought that film, as a medium, was peculiarly the \"victim of time\", he managed if not to refute time at least to confuse it. When the Argentinian writer Julio Cort\u00e1zar uses the word 'Bu\u00f1uel' as an adjective he means skipping without warning \"from Actium to the Anschluss\" - or as happens in L'Age d'or, from an imagined foundation of Rome to a troubled 1930. </p> <p>This is not quite the impression we get from the rather miscellaneous collection of materials in An Unspeakable Betrayal. Time's hand is all over this work, pushing everything remorselessly towards the past. The book is an English-language version of a French book published in 1995, which in turn contained work assembled in Spanish in 1982. Some of the material was even gathered in Francisco Aranda's biography of Bu\u00f1uel, published in Spanish in 1969, and available in English in 1975. </p> <p>The book opens with a selection of whimsical prose pieces Bu\u00f1uel published between 1922 and 1927. Some are Surrealist avant la lettre - Bu\u00f1uel says in My Last Breath that he wasn't much interested in Surrealism until well after he moved from Madrid, where he had studied, to Paris in 1925 - and some are literally Surrealist. The cymbals in an orchestra are said to be \"light shattered into fragments\"; a personified wind, \"howling with delight\", uproots trees, spins houses round and turns \"three priests sneaking down the street into as many inverted umbrellas\". A piece of roasted meat takes a walk, has all kinds of adventures. The least dated of these self-consciously artful pieces is perhaps 'La Sancta Misa Vaticanae', which describes a competition held in Rome to see who can say mass fastest: </p> <p>At the word 'go', the priests begin to say mass as fast as they can. Turning toward the faithful to say the Dominus vobiscum, making the sign of the cross etc, they reach incredible speeds, while the altar boy goes back and forth with the missal and the other ritual objects. A few fall down exhausted, like boxers. Finally, Mos\u00e9n Rendueles, of Huesca, is declared the winner, having said the entire mass in a record 1 minute and 45 seconds. As a prize he receives a monstrance and a large Aragonian wicker basket. </p> <p>An Unspeakable Betrayal also has the texts of a brief pre-Surrealist play called 'Hamlet', which Bu\u00f1uel put on with his friends in the cellar of the Caf\u00e9 Select in Montparnasse (\"At the end of each act, the peasants will be foreshadowed\"; \"Marquises artificially bleed to death along the nauseating walls\"), and of a rather learned lecture on the puppet theatre. The rest of the book offers a selection from Bu\u00f1uel's film criticism, a handful of more theoretical pronouncements on the cinema, some notes on three of his own films (L'Age d'or, Las Hurdes and Viridiana), some screenplays and/or synopses, including the version of Un Chien andalou which Bu\u00f1uel published in La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste in 1929, and some autobiographical jottings. </p> <p>Already in the late 1920s Bu\u00f1uel liked American films, especially the comic shorts of Ben Turpin, Harry Langdon and above all Buster Keaton. \"The finest poems that cinema has produced\", he said of American two-reelers, \"far more Surrealist than the films of Man Ray.\" \"'Keaton's films,\" Bu\u00f1uel wrote, \"give lessons to reality itself.\" He loved Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc (\"the humanity in these faces floods the screen and fills the room\"), and was very funny about Adolphe Menjou's moustache (\"a page of Proust brought to life on the upper lip\"). What Bu\u00f1uel has to say about film as a medium, about d\u00e9coupage and close-ups and the rest, is rather disappointing, since it seems like watered-down Eisenstein - but then we have the films. Among the later work in the volume is a set of film ideas which Bu\u00f1uel noted down some time in the 1940s (probably), and called 'Gags'. This one anticipates a moment in The Exterminating Angel: </p> <p>\"The owners of the castle and their guests, some six or seven people in all, climb the staircase of the main hall to go to bed. In the corridor on the second floor, where various doors lead to their rooms, they bid one another good night and retire. A short while later, one of the guests cautiously leaves his room on a mysterious expedition. As he approaches the staircase he hears the nearby voices of people coming up the stairs. They are exactly the same people as before, who again say good night and retire to their rooms.\"</p> <p>And this one has several echoes in Bu\u00f1uel's last films, especially The Phantom of Liberty: \"In a room, with four candles placed around it, is a coffin in which lies a very beautiful woman who might be the bride. As the protagonist draws near her, the corpse opens its eyes and says: 'Would you mind leaving me in peace?'\"</p> <p>There is also an unlikely treatment, written in English in 1937 for Paramount, for a film about Goya and the Duchess of Alba, which is so terrible that Bu\u00f1uel must have had the time of his life writing it. Goya is \"a large man, warm, passionate, yet retaining the peasant's virtues of simplicity and sincerity\". He saves the Duchess from a street escapade, but she doesn't yet know who he is. \"He leads her into the atelier where the walls are covered with paintings that are famous all through Spain. The Duchess regards them in amazement. 'You are Goya!' she exclaims. He nods.\"</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel said of Un Chien andalou that it was \"nothing other than a desperate, impassioned call for murder\", although his misguided audiences (\"this imbecilic crowd\") kept finding it \"beautiful\" or \"poetic\". Bu\u00f1uel's sons Juan Luis and Rafael rather ungratefully repeat the charge in a brief afterword to this book. \"That's what his films and writing were all about. To provoke, to shock, to destroy a society that he found corrupt and idiotic, to ridicule a religion that had oppressed millions of people and continues to do so... Now many of his books and belongings have been put into museums.\" </p> <p>Or even reprinted in works published by university presses. We might rather say, as I think Bu\u00f1uel himself would later have said, that if an audience can mistake a call for murder for a beautiful poem, there is something wrong with the work as well as the audience. Or something wrong with the description of the work. What Bu\u00f1uel learned magnificently to do as a filmmaker was to make it impossible for us to settle for beauty and poetry, however much we liked the works. The desperate call for murder was more than a metaphor but less than a programme, a response to the pain of a world which not even the most extreme violence could alter. </p> <p>The last time I saw Bu\u00f1uel we had an extended talk about chance. I had said how much I liked the moments in Tristana where the main character forces herself or her companions to make choices between two virtually identical things, to prefer one over the other: the chickpeas on her plate, the pillars of a colonnade in a courtyard, two narrow streets in Toledo. Bu\u00f1uel said that the things are not different but you can make them different. You look at any two identical things, two copies of the same book, two objects of the same colour, and they begin to seem different. \"This red is more red.\" Then you act on this invented difference and your life changes - or it doesn't. </p> <p>This way of thinking is about as far from determinism as it could be, but it doesn't seem to afford much human freedom. Our acts would have scarcely any antecedents, we could literally go either way with the chickpeas or the streets or the books or the colours: chance masquerading as choice. But then these same acts are heavy with consequences, just as they would be if we had made fully considered choices between radically different alternatives. We create a moment of meaningless freedom and then we squander it. Or perhaps we create the momentary flicker of freedom because we know the larger options are not available to us. When Tristana chooses between two chickpeas or two pillars, she insists on the real but slight difference between the candidates: \"There's always a little something that makes me like one of them more.\" The despairing corollary to this view would be that differences as slight as this convert every choice into a self-deluding game. On the other hand, when Tristana takes the street to the right rather than to the left, she meets the man who is to become her lover. Would she otherwise have missed him?</p> <p> What we call causes, Bu\u00f1uel says in My Last Breath, are really a limitless profusion of chances. \"Chance is the great master of all things. Necessity arrives only afterwards.\" Did Bu\u00f1uel believe this? Not exclusively or always, but it was one of his favourite stories about human behaviour, and I suddenly remember that at one time he was planning to make a film of Gide's Les Caves du Vatican, a novel predicated on the notion of the acte gratuit. The acts in Tristana are gratuitous in their making, but a mere phantom of liberty in their effect. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

      "bodyText": "An Unspeakable Betrayal: Selected Writings of Luis Bu\u00f1uel translated by Garrett White (California, 266 pp., \u00a317.50, 20 April, 0 520 20840 4 ) Buy it at BOL \"Studio Vingt-Huit - high up a winding street of Montmartre, in the full blasphemy of a freezing Sunday; taxis arriving, friends greeting each other, an excitable afternoon audience.\" The description is Cyril Connolly's, the occasion a showing of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's first film, Un Chien andalou. The audience seemed baffled at the end, and some of its members were angry, unprepared no doubt for what Connolly called the \"destructive reverence\" of the film. \"With the impression of having witnessed some infinitely ancient horror, Saturn swallowing his sons, we made our way out into the cold of February 1929, that unique and dazzling cold.\" Connolly's sense of the horror of the work, and of its romance (\"Un Chien andalou brought out the grandeur of the conflict inherent in romantic love, the truth that the heart is made to be broken, and after it has mended, to be broken again\"), led him to ignore its farcical aspects, its echoes of Buster Keaton and its complementary truth that romantic love is as often as not a matter of violent grabs and dashes, a pantomime of lust wagging its human puppets. But his experience anticipated that of thousands of others. The first film we see by any major director usually makes a mark, but we don't always feel we have seen Saturn swallowing his sons. The first Bu\u00f1uel film seen by most people of my generation who were not film-club addicts was probably Viridiana (1961). After two Surrealist films made in France (Un Chien andalou and L'Age d'or, 1930), and an astonishing documentary made in Spain (Las Hurdes, 1932), Bu\u00f1uel's career was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. He spent some time in the United States, then in 1946 settled in Mexico, where he made 18 films, of which only Los Olvidados (1950) got any real notice. Viridiana was made in Spain under Franco, and caused a tremendous scandal. After that Bu\u00f1uel made one more film in Spain (Tristana, 1970), two more films in Mexico (The Exterminating Angel, 1962, Simon of the Desert, 1965), and six films in France (Diary of a Chambermaid, 1964, Belle de jour, 1966, The Milky Way, 1969, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, 1972, The Phantom of Liberty, 1974, That Obscure Object of Desire, 1977). Viridiana has a number of startling and now famous images - a small crucifix flicks open to become a menacing knife; riotous, feasting beggars compose themselves into a parody of Leonardo's Last Supper, a snatch of Handel's 'Hallelujah Chorus' blaring in the soundtrack - and a ferocious implied argument about charity. All charity which is less than infinite leaves the world unchanged, and what charity is not less than infinite? Yet the most memorable feature of Viridiana, I think, is not its imagery or its argument but the harsh, reckless intelligence behind it, its manifest intention to disturb us beyond repair. Bu\u00f1uel used to say in lectures and interviews that his films are designed to show us that we don't live in the best of worlds. They certainly do that, but the formulation is not strong enough. Whatever we think about the world we live in, Bu\u00f1uel wants to send us home from the cinema feeling rattled and uncomfortable. This feeling, mysteriously, is not incompatible with being highly amused, but then the very idea of amusement seems troubling. \"Viridiana, at heart, is a humorous film,\" Bu\u00f1uel says in a typescript published in An Unspeakable Betrayal, but immediately adds that the humour is \"corrosive\". A few months after seeing Viridiana for the first time, I was in Spain, and met a charming man, a doctor, who claimed to know Bu\u00f1uel intimately, and to have helped him recruit the beggars for that film. I can't remember whether I believed him or not. Probably I did. Bu\u00f1uel for me was as distant as Cervantes or Saint Teresa, and I didn't even know where he lived. Then I forgot about the encounter, except for thinking kindly of the doctor and Madrid whenever I saw Viridiana again, or when my mind turned to Spain. And with time I certainly ceased to believe in the story. The doctor was entitled to his fantasy, after all; Bu\u00f1uel was the kind of figure who attracted legends and anecdotes. Then some 13 years later I saw The Phantom of Liberty. Right at the beginning of the film a group of Spanish prisoners is led out to be shot by Napoleon's soldiers. They include Bu\u00f1uel himself, as a monk; Serge Silberman, Bu\u00f1uel's producer; and the writer Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn, an old friend of Bu\u00f1uel's. They also include the uncannily familiar figure of my old acquaintance the doctor, Bu\u00f1uel's pal Jos\u00e9-Luis Barros. It took me a while to place the recognised face, and of course I didn't fill in all the details even then. A few years later I met Bu\u00f1uel in Mexico. He was delighted when I told him the story - he loved coincidences - and thought it would have been even better if Barros and I had turned out to be long-lost twins, perhaps identified by a birthmark. I hang onto that moment in the cinema because when I saw the film and found the face I realised I had caught a piece of lost time. Not only Madrid and Dr Barros and an earlier self, but Viridiana as it felt when I first saw it: blasphemous, brilliant, ragged, indifferent to the preoccupations of unity and coherence which most aesthetics demand - Saturn swallowing a daughter. If I had been less devoted to the notion of the death of the author I might have got more out of my encounters with Bu\u00f1uel himself. But I'm not sure. He was so courtly and entertaining, so willing to treat me as a new-found friend rather than a nosy writer, that I had real difficulty in thinking about our conversations as material. Material for what? For the book about his films I was trying to write, or the biography I had no intention of writing? The anecdotes he told were the ones he usually told, often ones I'd already read somewhere: his stock of stories. He was a 78-year-old famous man, he had his best memories organised, he had shaped them into tales, and he was soon to put them in a book called My Last Breath (1982), which he wrote in collaboration with his scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re. Didn't I gather rich insights into the films? Some, but not as many as you might think. This was manifestly the Bu\u00f1uel who made Bu\u00f1uel's films, there were plenty of continuities between the mind I'd met in the work and the mind I was meeting over drinks. The author was fully alive in that sense, and discussing his films with Bu\u00f1uel was a delight. But I didn't understand the films a whole lot better for talking to him, and any language I might find for writing about the films was going to be quite different from the language in which I could describe him, if I was even going to try to describe him. A person is not a film, and films have all kinds of adventures once the director has finished editing them. \"I don't believe one's life can be confused with one's work,\" Bu\u00f1uel says in the book I've just mentioned. What I did get from meeting Bu\u00f1uel, apart from much pleasure and laughter, was a feeling for the kind of artist he was, the peculiar mixture of austerity and mischief he brought to the cinema. You can see this in the films as well, of course, but there is so much else in them, so much obsession and yearning, so much appetite for pain, so much unappeased theology. All this must have been in the person somewhere, certainly, but it wasn't in the person you met. He had trained himself, I believe, to save his nightmares for his movies. What was left in daily life was a curious mind and an imagination always playing with possibility, but above all his craft and his career, the sense of film as an art and a discipline, a kind of experiment in which even the wildest jokes took on a certain aspect of rigour or purity. I met Bu\u00f1uel in July 1978, through an old friend, Santiago Genov\u00e9s, a Mexican anthropologist. Santiago, born in Spain, always called Bu\u00f1uel Don Luis, and after a bit of practice, so did I. I saw him a number of times in company over the next three years, and I had many conversations with him in the late afternoons. The last time I saw him was in June 1981. I didn't go back to Mexico for a while after that, and he died in July 1983. First impressions. He is old, bent, has rather crooked teeth, large intelligent eyes behind heavy glasses. An amiable, mischievous grin resides almost constantly on his face. He is very deaf, but can hear if you speak loud and clear, although communication is always a little uncertain, apt to misfire or lose its sequence. A small terrier called Tristana trots in and sits on the sofa. Don Luis, the scourge of actors and actresses, can't get her to move or leave. \"I am a monk,\" he says, \"I don't go out.\" It's largely true. The world comes to him, insofar as he allows it to. But it doesn't come much or often. He says he feels old, that he was \"formidable\" between 40 and 60, and felt fine in his 60s. Now he can't remember the name of the pills he's supposed to take for his diabetes, he starts to do a sum and can't remember what he has just multiplied by what. He feels dizzy at times. He says all this with genuine impatience and distaste, but also with an energy which comes out as a kind of unshakable gaiety. Bu\u00f1uel likes some contemporary directors, but not many. American films, he says. Woody Allen. Stanley Kubrick. \"That film with those shots of the man's eye.\" \"A Clockwork Orange?\" \"That's the one.\" Nice thought, coming from the man whose film career began with the image of an eye slashed by a razor. Bu\u00f1uel tells me a Hitchcock story, which he tells again in My Last Breath. There is a dinner in Bu\u00f1uel's honour at George Cukor's house in Hollywood in 1972. Fifteen famous directors are there, including John Ford, Rouben Mamoulian, Robert Mulligan, George Stevens, Robert Wise, William Wyler, Billy Wilder. Hitchcock sits next to Bu\u00f1uel, says very little, then at one point puts an arm round his companion's shoulder and says with deep admiration: \"Bu\u00f1uel, that wooden leg in Tristana. That wooden leg.\" Bu\u00f1uel and his wife Jeanne lived in a small and tidy house in the southern central part of Mexico City, the place Bu\u00f1uel called \"this metropolis without end\". Both had become Mexican citizens in 1949. The street was a quiet cul-de-sac off a busy thoroughfare; the house had a small enclosed garden. \"Come and see me when you like,\" Bu\u00f1uel would say, \"but telephone first to set up a time.\" I would telephone, talk to Jeanne, and ask if I could see Don Luis. She would consult him, and he would invariably say: \"How about tomorrow around five?\" So I learned not to call if I couldn't go the next day. Generally I would watch a film of his at the Mexican Cineteca and then drive over to his house. I would say, \"I saw El today, or Robinson Crusoe,\" or whatever I had seen, and he would say: \"Terrible film, the director should be shot.\" I would murmur in polite disagreement, and ask him a question about the work. One day I said I had very much liked a French film he had made in Corsica, Cela s'appelle l'Aurore (1955). \"Yes,\" he said. \"I liked it when I made it.\" He didn't care for technical queries, and I discovered that general questions, critics' questions, didn't interest him, that he didn't want to discuss ideas or meanings. But he would talk about all kinds of things, if you could get him started on the right sort of detail - the ostrich in close-up at the end of The Phantom of Liberty, say, the garrulous duel between Jansenist and Jesuit in The Milky Way. He even loved ideas. He just didn't like the idea of them. One day I didn't offer my polite disagreement. I had been to see his A Woman without Love (1951), a version of Maupassant's novel Pierre et Jean, a truly terrible film by any standards, without a single redeeming or even interesting moment, as far as I could see. In My Last Breath, Bu\u00f1uel was to say this was \"no doubt my worst film\", but I didn't then know that he thought that. A number of Bu\u00f1uel's Mexican works are jagged and uneven, but virtually all of them have luminous features, touches that reveal the quirky or reckless hand of the master. Not this one. I said I didn't think the director should be shot but the film was awful, and asked what happened. Bu\u00f1uel nodded, remembering. Finally he said: \"I couldn't think of anything\" - \"No se me occuri\u00f3 nada,\" literally \"nothing occurred to me\". He couldn't think of anything? Yes, he knew the film was boring from the start but assumed something would occur to him while he was shooting, some gag or angle or twist that would liven it up. That was how he worked, and almost always something occurred to him. There is a little fable about art here. You plan carefully, and you leave room for inspiration, in fact you rely on its arrival. But then inspiration, always an uncertain dancing partner, fails to show up, and you just keep going and finish the job. Then you make another plan. I was then rather keen on the idea of Bu\u00f1uel as a permanent Surrealist, of Surrealism as a continuing state of mind, and so was slightly shocked to hear him place the movement so firmly in the past. \"When I was a Surrealist\", he said, and \"in the days of the Surrealists\" - as if the group was a club or a team you could join or leave. He was right, of course, Surrealism was always a thinner, more privileged form of revolt than it liked to imagine it was - or than I liked to imagine it was. The bourgeoisie revolting against the bourgeoisie, Bu\u00f1uel said in My Last Breath. But there is a continuing mentality, too, which has to do not with shock or rebellion but with resistance to settled or predictable meanings: resistance to interpretation itself, if by 'interpretation' we mean not just trying to make sense of things but succeeding in doing it. Early in our first conversation we spoke about That Obscure Object of Desire, then a recent film, which was to be Bu\u00f1uel's last. This work, notoriously, has two actresses playing a single role, that of the taunting, endlessly desired Conchita, the role played by Marlene Dietrich (on her own) when Sternberg made The Devil Is a Woman, his film based on the same novel. There is a single fictional character, with a name and a mother and a place in the plot, and indeed a single voice on the soundtrack, that of Carole Bouquet. On the screen, though, we see Carole Bouquet alternating with Angela Molina. They look quite different, although audience reactions to this trick have varied immensely: some people haven't noticed it, and some haven't been able to take their minds off it, and many have had reactions situated somewhere in between. The point, for most viewers, is to make meaning out of the alternation. The point for Bu\u00f1uel was to defeat meaning. There was to be nothing psychological about the switches, he said to me, no Jekyll and Hyde story, only random alternation. Bu\u00f1uel's films are full of touches like this, there to scramble old meanings, not to provide new ones, and they could have been fuller of them. Bu\u00f1uel himself was proud of the idea of the two actresses but was ready to agree that it was crazy - he had started shooting, in Paris and Madrid, with one actress, Maria Schneider, and when he fired her thought the production was over - but Serge Silberman, his producer, took to the suggestion instantly. Unlike Oscar Dancigers, the producer of Los Olvidados, who had persuaded Bu\u00f1uel to take a series of similar moves out of the film: a full symphony orchestra playing in a building under construction, a glossy top hat briefly glimpsed on a stove in a Mexico City hovel. Most viewers would miss these moments, Bu\u00f1uel thought, and those who saw them would wonder what they had seen, just as we wonder, in That Obscure Object of Desire, whether we have really seen two actresses or weirdly misremembered just one. Dancigers's view, which Bu\u00f1uel accepted in practice without agreeing to the principle, was that the director was ruining the film. \"I don't care if I ruin films,\" Bu\u00f1uel said. This could be a motto for him: when he is lucky, his films are the ruins of films he didn't want to make. My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at the Bu\u00f1uels' house in 1978. There were a number of guests, much festivity, champagne, many Spanish jokes. Everyone had a good time, and I had a small illumination. This orderly, good-humoured house, these kindly people: isn't there something odd here? Only what Bu\u00f1uel has taught us to find odd. We are the people who managed to have a meal together, unlike the characters in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. When the meal is over, we shall be able to leave (we were able to leave), unlike the characters in The Exterminating Angel. Bu\u00f1uel himself is not outside the world he criticises, he is part of it, and so are his friends and family. Social arrangements are foolish and apparently fragile, because they are so arbitrary and groundless. Everything about them could be different, and is different in other times and places. \"Everyone is a barbarian for someone,\" as a character says in The Phantom of Liberty: \"on est toujours le barbare de quelqu'un\". And yet it is because these arrangements are arbitrary and groundless that we have so little purchase on them, and they seem so strangely unchangeable. The radical instability of things in Bu\u00f1uel's films is a wish, an act of fictional defiance, the expression of a political and moral need. Their durability in reality is their discreet and remorseless excess of charm. Bu\u00f1uel's great subject is the intimate failure of the bourgeoisie to revolt against the bourgeoisie. Hence Bu\u00f1uel's fondness for heretics, and stories about heretics. Heretics are not atheists, outsiders, they are believers who believe something different, they are with us and not with us. That's why we have to persecute them, or why, if we are the heretics, we get persecuted. The Milky Way, Bu\u00f1uel said, could have been made about any form of heresy, artistic, scientific, sociological. He chose religious heresies because he happened to know something about them - because of his Jesuit education, he said. Bu\u00f1uel attended a school in Zaragoza that sounds at all points identical with the school Stephen Dedalus attends in Dublin in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. There is something disingenuous, even mischievous, about this claim, since Bu\u00f1uel's religious preoccupations are clearly more firmly anchored than the remark suggests, more like a trauma than an option. But the intellectual reach of the idea is interesting, and says something about the intimacy of failed revolt in Bu\u00f1uel's works, from L'Age d'or through Los Olvidados, Nazar\u00edn, Viridiana, Tristana and The Phantom of Liberty. Heretics often suffer dreadfully because they are so close to the doctrine they dissent from. But then they are close to it. Even their dissent can be seen as a form of complicity, a failure to get outside the engulfing system. This is a revolt which can't escape its family of thought, which will always have been the secret friend of its worst enemy. Bu\u00f1uel was born in Calanda, near Teruel, in Spain, just over 100 years ago (22 February 1900), but he insisted that the place itself plunged him into an older time.\"My infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere\"; \"I had the good fortune of spending my childhood in the Middle Ages.\" One effect of this ancientness was that his films, after a certain point, stopped ageing, since they so fluently mingled contemporary violence, drugs, high-tech killers, up-to-date political jokes with much older customs. When a car hits a tree in The Milky Way, a voice comes out of the car radio preaching a sermon on the pains of hell. The text is from a work by Fray Luis de Granada, a medieval mystic. The voice is Bu\u00f1uel's. Although Bu\u00f1uel thought that film, as a medium, was peculiarly the \"victim of time\", he managed if not to refute time at least to confuse it. When the Argentinian writer Julio Cort\u00e1zar uses the word 'Bu\u00f1uel' as an adjective he means skipping without warning \"from Actium to the Anschluss\" - or as happens in L'Age d'or, from an imagined foundation of Rome to a troubled 1930. This is not quite the impression we get from the rather miscellaneous collection of materials in An Unspeakable Betrayal. Time's hand is all over this work, pushing everything remorselessly towards the past. The book is an English-language version of a French book published in 1995, which in turn contained work assembled in Spanish in 1982. Some of the material was even gathered in Francisco Aranda's biography of Bu\u00f1uel, published in Spanish in 1969, and available in English in 1975. The book opens with a selection of whimsical prose pieces Bu\u00f1uel published between 1922 and 1927. Some are Surrealist avant la lettre - Bu\u00f1uel says in My Last Breath that he wasn't much interested in Surrealism until well after he moved from Madrid, where he had studied, to Paris in 1925 - and some are literally Surrealist. The cymbals in an orchestra are said to be \"light shattered into fragments\"; a personified wind, \"howling with delight\", uproots trees, spins houses round and turns \"three priests sneaking down the street into as many inverted umbrellas\". A piece of roasted meat takes a walk, has all kinds of adventures. The least dated of these self-consciously artful pieces is perhaps 'La Sancta Misa Vaticanae', which describes a competition held in Rome to see who can say mass fastest: At the word 'go', the priests begin to say mass as fast as they can. Turning toward the faithful to say the Dominus vobiscum, making the sign of the cross etc, they reach incredible speeds, while the altar boy goes back and forth with the missal and the other ritual objects. A few fall down exhausted, like boxers. Finally, Mos\u00e9n Rendueles, of Huesca, is declared the winner, having said the entire mass in a record 1 minute and 45 seconds. As a prize he receives a monstrance and a large Aragonian wicker basket. An Unspeakable Betrayal also has the texts of a brief pre-Surrealist play called 'Hamlet', which Bu\u00f1uel put on with his friends in the cellar of the Caf\u00e9 Select in Montparnasse (\"At the end of each act, the peasants will be foreshadowed\"; \"Marquises artificially bleed to death along the nauseating walls\"), and of a rather learned lecture on the puppet theatre. The rest of the book offers a selection from Bu\u00f1uel's film criticism, a handful of more theoretical pronouncements on the cinema, some notes on three of his own films (L'Age d'or, Las Hurdes and Viridiana), some screenplays and/or synopses, including the version of Un Chien andalou which Bu\u00f1uel published in La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste in 1929, and some autobiographical jottings. Already in the late 1920s Bu\u00f1uel liked American films, especially the comic shorts of Ben Turpin, Harry Langdon and above all Buster Keaton. \"The finest poems that cinema has produced\", he said of American two-reelers, \"far more Surrealist than the films of Man Ray.\" \"'Keaton's films,\" Bu\u00f1uel wrote, \"give lessons to reality itself.\" He loved Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc (\"the humanity in these faces floods the screen and fills the room\"), and was very funny about Adolphe Menjou's moustache (\"a page of Proust brought to life on the upper lip\"). What Bu\u00f1uel has to say about film as a medium, about d\u00e9coupage and close-ups and the rest, is rather disappointing, since it seems like watered-down Eisenstein - but then we have the films. Among the later work in the volume is a set of film ideas which Bu\u00f1uel noted down some time in the 1940s (probably), and called 'Gags'. This one anticipates a moment in The Exterminating Angel: \"The owners of the castle and their guests, some six or seven people in all, climb the staircase of the main hall to go to bed. In the corridor on the second floor, where various doors lead to their rooms, they bid one another good night and retire. A short while later, one of the guests cautiously leaves his room on a mysterious expedition. As he approaches the staircase he hears the nearby voices of people coming up the stairs. They are exactly the same people as before, who again say good night and retire to their rooms.\" And this one has several echoes in Bu\u00f1uel's last films, especially The Phantom of Liberty: \"In a room, with four candles placed around it, is a coffin in which lies a very beautiful woman who might be the bride. As the protagonist draws near her, the corpse opens its eyes and says: 'Would you mind leaving me in peace?'\" There is also an unlikely treatment, written in English in 1937 for Paramount, for a film about Goya and the Duchess of Alba, which is so terrible that Bu\u00f1uel must have had the time of his life writing it. Goya is \"a large man, warm, passionate, yet retaining the peasant's virtues of simplicity and sincerity\". He saves the Duchess from a street escapade, but she doesn't yet know who he is. \"He leads her into the atelier where the walls are covered with paintings that are famous all through Spain. The Duchess regards them in amazement. 'You are Goya!' she exclaims. He nods.\" Bu\u00f1uel said of Un Chien andalou that it was \"nothing other than a desperate, impassioned call for murder\", although his misguided audiences (\"this imbecilic crowd\") kept finding it \"beautiful\" or \"poetic\". Bu\u00f1uel's sons Juan Luis and Rafael rather ungratefully repeat the charge in a brief afterword to this book. \"That's what his films and writing were all about. To provoke, to shock, to destroy a society that he found corrupt and idiotic, to ridicule a religion that had oppressed millions of people and continues to do so... Now many of his books and belongings have been put into museums.\" Or even reprinted in works published by university presses. We might rather say, as I think Bu\u00f1uel himself would later have said, that if an audience can mistake a call for murder for a beautiful poem, there is something wrong with the work as well as the audience. Or something wrong with the description of the work. What Bu\u00f1uel learned magnificently to do as a filmmaker was to make it impossible for us to settle for beauty and poetry, however much we liked the works. The desperate call for murder was more than a metaphor but less than a programme, a response to the pain of a world which not even the most extreme violence could alter. The last time I saw Bu\u00f1uel we had an extended talk about chance. I had said how much I liked the moments in Tristana where the main character forces herself or her companions to make choices between two virtually identical things, to prefer one over the other: the chickpeas on her plate, the pillars of a colonnade in a courtyard, two narrow streets in Toledo. Bu\u00f1uel said that the things are not different but you can make them different. You look at any two identical things, two copies of the same book, two objects of the same colour, and they begin to seem different. \"This red is more red.\" Then you act on this invented difference and your life changes - or it doesn't. This way of thinking is about as far from determinism as it could be, but it doesn't seem to afford much human freedom. Our acts would have scarcely any antecedents, we could literally go either way with the chickpeas or the streets or the books or the colours: chance masquerading as choice. But then these same acts are heavy with consequences, just as they would be if we had made fully considered choices between radically different alternatives. We create a moment of meaningless freedom and then we squander it. Or perhaps we create the momentary flicker of freedom because we know the larger options are not available to us. When Tristana chooses between two chickpeas or two pillars, she insists on the real but slight difference between the candidates: \"There's always a little something that makes me like one of them more.\" The despairing corollary to this view would be that differences as slight as this convert every choice into a self-deluding game. On the other hand, when Tristana takes the street to the right rather than to the left, she meets the man who is to become her lover. Would she otherwise have missed him? What we call causes, Bu\u00f1uel says in My Last Breath, are really a limitless profusion of chances. \"Chance is the great master of all things. Necessity arrives only afterwards.\" Did Bu\u00f1uel believe this? Not exclusively or always, but it was one of his favourite stories about human behaviour, and I suddenly remember that at one time he was planning to make a film of Gide's Les Caves du Vatican, a novel predicated on the notion of the acte gratuit. The acts in Tristana are gratuitous in their making, but a mere phantom of liberty in their effect. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

Four people were trapped inside a crushed carriage after the crash on the Pepsi Max Big One rollercoaster, Lancashire ambulance service confirmed. Fire and ambulance crews called to the scene at 8.45pm found the four people stuck in the back of a rollercoaster car at 25ft above the ground. Two of the injured were freed immediately and taken to hospital. Firefighters used cutting equipment to release the remaining two casualties and lowered them to the ground with ropes, Lancashire fire service confirmed. The accident was caused by one rollercoaster car shunting into another at the roller coaster station where people get on and off the \u00a312m white knuckle ride. In a statement last night, Blackpool Pleasure Beach management said: \"A stopped train waiting to enter the station on the rollercoaster was bumped by a second slow-moving train that was not completely stopped by the primary braking system of the ride.\" The accident is the second to hit the 235ft rollercoaster, which has become one of the Pleasure Beach's star attractions. Twenty six people were injured in a collision in July 1994 less than a month after the 87mph ride first opened. The management said the accident was caused by computer failure when emergency brakes failed to halt a train which careered into the back of another at 35mph. Eight passengers, trapped by jammed safety bars, had to be cut free, while 26 people were taken to hospital with minor injuries. Others were treated for shock. Only two hours before the crash, the ride was shut for an hour because of a computer fault. Twenty passengers were stranded for 15 minutes 200ft in the air before the train moved on to allow them down an emergency staircase.

But the Sierra Leone government said it \"would not bow to this kind of pressure\" by meeting the captors' demands.</p> <p>Asked how the West Side Boys came to capture the soldiers, Colonel Cambodia said: \"We captured these soldiers because they entered into our area of responsibility without communicating with us or our commanders.\"</p> <p>The five freed hostages were moved to a British supply ship in Freetown port yesterday for a debriefing in which they were expected to explain how their heavily armed convoy of three vehicles came to be captured by an irregular group of thugs, many of them teenagers. \"They've got some serious questions to answer,\" said the British military spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Tony Cramp.</p> <p>British officials in London insisted yesterday that negotiations were still the best course to pursue. However, they described the situation as \"delicate\" and \"volatile\".</p> <p>Officials in London said the West Side Boys, notorious for their drinking and drug use, wanted the world \"to take notice of their grievances\". This helped to explain why British forces had given them the satellite phone and anti-malaria drugs.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence was still unable to explain last night why the soldiers had turned off the main road so far from their base camp at Benguema, where they were training the Sierra Leone army. British officials in London said that they were surprised the soldiers had disappeared into the bush - but they were not surprised that the men had lunched with Jordanian UN peacekeepers before the journey that led to them being captured.</p> <p>While the MoD is understood to be pressing for negotiations to continue, it would be surprising if it was not coming under ministerial pressure to consider contingency plans.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stakes were rising last night in the increasingly desperate efforts to secure the release of the remaining six British soldiers in Sierra Leone as their captors, the renegade West Side Boys, made a series of near-impossible demands, including dissolving President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government in favour of a power-sharing administration. The West Side Boys yesterday described the hostages as \"very comfortable\" but British military sources said that the most senior officer among them, a major, had been beaten by his captors. A spokesman for the group, calling himself Colonel Cambodia, called the BBC African service yesterday, using a satellite phone provided by the British army before five soldiers were freed on Wednesday night. He said the hostages, from the Royal Irish Regiment, were taken in order to get Britain to pressure President Kabbah to recognise the West Side Boys as a legitimate group, free their arrested leaders from prison and to form a new government with seats for their leaders. \"We are holding on to them so that we'll be able to pass our requests through them to the government because the government is a government against the West Side Boys,\" he said. \"We will hold onto them until our demands are solved.\" Negotiations have continued between the commander of the Royal Irish Regiment contingent in Sierra Leone, Colonel Simon Fordham, and the West Side Boys' leader, \"Brigadier General Kallay\", to win the release of the remaining soldiers. But the Sierra Leone government said it \"would not bow to this kind of pressure\" by meeting the captors' demands. Asked how the West Side Boys came to capture the soldiers, Colonel Cambodia said: \"We captured these soldiers because they entered into our area of responsibility without communicating with us or our commanders.\" The five freed hostages were moved to a British supply ship in Freetown port yesterday for a debriefing in which they were expected to explain how their heavily armed convoy of three vehicles came to be captured by an irregular group of thugs, many of them teenagers. \"They've got some serious questions to answer,\" said the British military spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Tony Cramp. British officials in London insisted yesterday that negotiations were still the best course to pursue. However, they described the situation as \"delicate\" and \"volatile\". Officials in London said the West Side Boys, notorious for their drinking and drug use, wanted the world \"to take notice of their grievances\". This helped to explain why British forces had given them the satellite phone and anti-malaria drugs. The Ministry of Defence was still unable to explain last night why the soldiers had turned off the main road so far from their base camp at Benguema, where they were training the Sierra Leone army. British officials in London said that they were surprised the soldiers had disappeared into the bush - but they were not surprised that the men had lunched with Jordanian UN peacekeepers before the journey that led to them being captured. While the MoD is understood to be pressing for negotiations to continue, it would be surprising if it was not coming under ministerial pressure to consider contingency plans.",

      "bodyText": "The final terrifying moments of Air France flight 4590 were revealed yesterday when French accident investigators released their preliminary report on last month's Concorde crash outside Paris, in which 113 people died. A transcript of the cockpit voice recorder shows that the supersonic jetliner, starting a flight from Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport to New York, ploughed into a hotel in the small town of Gonesse, just one minute 17 seconds after its pilot, Christian Marty, was told it was on fire. It shows that the crew, who were unable to retract the undercarriage, had lost all power in one engine and could neither accelerate nor gain altitude, tried desperately to reach Le Bourget airport, nearby. Marty's last words, at a few seconds after 2.44pm on July 25, were: \"Too late... no time.\" The co-pilot was then heard to say: \"Le Bourget, Le Bourget. Negative; we are trying Le Bourget.\" Sixteen seconds later the recording ends. At 14.45 the control tower informed the fire and emergency services that the flight, carrying 100 mainly German passengers and nine crew, had crashed near Le Bourget. A minute later air traffic control announced: \"To all listening aircraft, please hold back a moment. We will try to pick ourselves up and recommence take-offs.\" The 90-page, highly technical report contains little new information on the crash, which prompted Air France to ground its remaining Concordes immediately and British Airways, the only other airline to fly the ageing supersonic jet, to follow suit nearly three weeks later. The investigators from the French accident inquiry board (BEA) confirms the hypothesis that a burst tyre set off the fatal chain of events which brought the plane down, killing all those on board and another four people on the ground. \"The July 25 accident shows that the destruction of a tyre, an event that we cannot say will not recur, had catastrophic consequences in a short period of time, preventing the crew from rectifying the situation,\" the report says. \"The crew had no way of knowing about the nature of the fire nor any means of fighting it.\" It also confirms that a small metal strip, probably from another airplane, was found on the runway. \"It has holes in it and in some of these holes appear to be Cherry aeronautical rivets. This strip has not been identified as coming from Concorde,\" the report says. Cherry is a type of rivet not used on Concorde. The BEA said last month that the 40cm piece of metal almost certainly gashed the Concorde's tyre, sending large chunks of rubber hurtling at tremendous speed into the plane's fuel tanks, which are contained in its delta-shaped wings, and starting the blaze. \"Shortly before rotation [take-off speed], the front right tyre of the left undercarriage became damaged and tyre fragments were projected against the fuselage,\" the interim report, released on the internet, says. \"At least one fuel tank was ruptured in one or more places, resulting in a substantial fuel leak. \"The leaking fuel caught light and a very violent fire ensued throughout the duration of the flight. Engine problems occurred in engine number 2 and, briefly, in engine number 1. The aircraft flew for approximately one minute.\" The report formally recommends that Concorde's airworthiness certificates should be suspended until \"appropriate measures have been put in place to guarantee a satisfactory level of safety as regards the risk associated with tyre blow-outs\" - a step the civil aviation authority and its French equivalent, the DGAC, carried out on August 16. Over the 25 years Concorde has been in commercial operation, there have been at least seven potentially catastrophic incidents in which one or more of its tyres have burst, leading to punctures in the wings or fuel tanks. But in all those incidents it was a piece of flying metal - from the undercarriage or water deflectors - that caused the damage, not tyre rubber itself. Safety efforts were therefore concentrated on strengthening all the metal parts that could be broken off in a tyre burst, but not on protecting the wings themselves. Stressing that the catastrophe could have happened at any time, the investigators say:\"Experience in service has shown that a tyre blow-out during taxiing, landing and take-off is not an improbable event on Concorde and that such an event is indeed capable of causing structural and system damage. However, a blow-out of this kind has never before led to a fuel fire.\" The report does not contain any analysis or final conclusions about the cause of the disaster, and notes that the sequence of damage and the links between the various events have \"not yet been fully established\".

      "bodyText": "The widow of a man who hanged himself while mentally disturbed has learned 13 years after his death that his brain was given to a medical school for research. The revelation comes in the wake of scandals over the retention of children's organs at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool and Bristol Royal infirmary. In this case the family are orthodox Jews; removal of the brain flouts the requirement that the whole body must be buried within 24 hours of death. Cyril Isaacs hanged himself at home in 1987 after several months of disturbed behaviour. Now his widow has discovered that his brain was given to Manchester University medical school after a postmortem carried out at the request of the coroner. Elaine Isaacs is taking her husband's GP to the General Medical Council, alleging that he failed to grasp the seriousness of her husband's condition after he took several overdoses. In April she came across a letter to her late husband's GP from the medical school explaining that it was doing research on brain chemistry and mental illness and asking about Mr Isaacs's medical history. She tracked down the pathologist who performed the postmortem, who confirmed the brain had been removed with the authorisation of the Rochdale coroner. Last month she was told the brain had not been used in research and had been incinerated around 1993. Mrs Isaacs, 55, has asked Rochdale council to investigate the role of the coroner. Her MP, Ivan Lewis, has written to Alan Milburn, the health secretary, asking for an investigation. A spokeswoman for the mental health charity Mind said: \"It's a dreadful case and raises issues about accountability and treating people with dignity and respect [and] about the extent to which this occurs more widely in the NHS.\"",

We're happy with the [government] response,\" said Jean-Marc Barrey, the general secretary of the seaman's branch of the CFDT union, after a small but noisy march through Paris during which fishermen let off flares and and sounded fog horns outside the fisheries department.</p> <p>In London, Mr Prescott angrily expressed British frustrations at yet another French disruption of cross-Channel traffic and demanded far-reaching talks with the French government to ensure Britain \"does not have a knife held to its throat\" every time a social or industrial conflict breaks out in France.</p> <p>\"I've been on the phone this morning both to the French government and the [European] commission to make it absolutely clear this holding Britain to ransom because of an industrial dispute in France is totally unacceptable to us,\" he said. \"We will not accept Britain should be blockaded and held to ransom simply because of a social problem in France.\"</p> <p>The French government climbdown will do little to dissuade other dissatisfied sectors of the French workforce that they can get what they want through a similar show of force. Taxi drivers have already called a national day of action for today in protest at rising fuel prices, and farmers and private ambulance drivers have issued similar warnings.</p> <p>The agreement came too late for thousands of British travellers stranded on both sides of the Channel. There were angry scenes yesterday morning at the Channel tunnel's Calais terminal as Britons tried to clear barricades.</p> <p>In Britain, most of those trapped by the blockade had no choice but to stay put.</p> <p>Bruce Kilpatrick, a lorry driver from Castle Douglas in Scotland said: \"I'm hacked off. It's a total disaster. They are complaining about the price of diesel but they should come here for a month and see what they think about our prices.

      "bodyText": "The French government yesterday caved in to the demands of the country's fishermen, bringing to an end a three-day blockade of French ports that caused misery to thousands of British travellers and fury in London. The fishermen began lifting their blockades of the main Channel ports and the entrance to the Channel tunnel in the early afternoon, soon after their representatives emerged satisfied from talks in Paris with the agriculture and fisheries minister, Jean Glavany. The minister, facing sharp criticism over the fishermen's action from Britain's deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said a deal had been agreed to indirectly compensate the fishermen for the fuel price increases that they argued were threatening their livelihoods. \"Their case is well-founded and their industry is confronting exceptional difficulties,\" Mr Glavany said. \"Even if the government is not responsible, we have to ensure the industry remains viable.\" He said fishermen's social charges would be reduced and some port fees paid by the state. \"It's a good deal. We're happy with the [government] response,\" said Jean-Marc Barrey, the general secretary of the seaman's branch of the CFDT union, after a small but noisy march through Paris during which fishermen let off flares and and sounded fog horns outside the fisheries department. In London, Mr Prescott angrily expressed British frustrations at yet another French disruption of cross-Channel traffic and demanded far-reaching talks with the French government to ensure Britain \"does not have a knife held to its throat\" every time a social or industrial conflict breaks out in France. \"I've been on the phone this morning both to the French government and the [European] commission to make it absolutely clear this holding Britain to ransom because of an industrial dispute in France is totally unacceptable to us,\" he said. \"We will not accept Britain should be blockaded and held to ransom simply because of a social problem in France.\" The French government climbdown will do little to dissuade other dissatisfied sectors of the French workforce that they can get what they want through a similar show of force. Taxi drivers have already called a national day of action for today in protest at rising fuel prices, and farmers and private ambulance drivers have issued similar warnings. The agreement came too late for thousands of British travellers stranded on both sides of the Channel. There were angry scenes yesterday morning at the Channel tunnel's Calais terminal as Britons tried to clear barricades. In Britain, most of those trapped by the blockade had no choice but to stay put. Bruce Kilpatrick, a lorry driver from Castle Douglas in Scotland said: \"I'm hacked off. It's a total disaster. They are complaining about the price of diesel but they should come here for a month and see what they think about our prices. I've spent \u00a3400 extra on food, fuel and essentials and I just can't afford it.\" Owner-drivers were worst hit. One, Karl Jones, from Walsall in the West Midlands, said: \"This is the sort of thing that could ruin me. I'm a one-man band and every hour I spend here rather than on the road means that I'm an hour closer to bankruptcy. \"These fishermen talk about solidarity but they don't seem to have much regard for the ordinary workers in this country.\" As traffic got moving again, Pat Evans, 34, travelling to Brittany with her husband Mike, 36, and two children aged eight and 10, said: \"We were so looking forward to this holiday but this has taken some of the shine off it.

The pay-TV company, in which BSkyB has a 24% holding, will use the cash to help fund the roll-out of its digital services. As a consequence of the sale the price of BSkyB shares fell back 44p to a three-month low of \u00a311.25, comfortably, or rather uncomfortably, below their March peak of \u00a321.58, the inevitable effect of a large tranche of shares hitting the market at once. That could, however, make this a good time to step in. It is worth remembering that some recent block sales of shares have not got away easily and, although the BSkyB sale was at what one dealer described as a \"thumping discount\", the appetite is clearly there for the shares. \"In the past few months a lot of uncertainties have been removed,\" said one media analyst. \"BSkyB has retained the Premier League football broadcasting rights, taken control of [interactive service] Open, which has been a huge success, and now the concern over the Kirch stake has been removed. With those three things resolved, BSkyB is a much cleaner story.\" The view was echoed by Paul Richards at ABN Amro who described the shares as a strong buy. \"It has the leading position in pay television in the UK by a country mile and taking full control of Open was a very smart thing to do. They also have a significant stake in the only digital satellite player in Germany, which is pretty valuable.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Croatian prime minister, Ivica Racan, ordered an immediate inquiry yesterday into the murder of a key witness in war crimes investigations into the murder of Serb civilians in Croatia in 1991. Milan Levar, 46, was killed by a bomb outside his home in Gospic, central Croatia, on Monday. It was the third attempt on his life. \"Those who are responsible for crimes committed in Croatia will not manage to thwart, by terror, blackmail or murders, Croatian authorities in efforts to punish all those liable for war crimes,\" Mr Racan told a cabinet session. But it emerged yesterday that a request for protection for Levar and his family from the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague had been mislaid. According to a Croatian interior ministry statement, a letter was received from the Hague tribunal in April 1998, but the promise of protection was never passed on to county police covering Gospic. Levar had twice given evidence at a time when the nationalist government of Franjo Tudjman was refusing even to allow war crimes investigators to enter Croatia. He was the first and so far only Croat to testify against his compatriots. Levar had been offered protection by the Hague tribunal, but chose instead to stay in Croatia, believing that the publicity surrounding his allegations would protect him. Levar's murder may seriously hamper future investigations of the tribunal, but Graham Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor, said that the organisation would continue to do \"everything possible to provide adequate protection for all our witnesses\". Some 41 people are currently either on trial or awaiting trial in the Hague - the majority Bosnian Serbs. Many victims and witnesses of atrocities have already given evidence. The tribunal has yet to issue any indictments for crimes against Serbs in Croatia, but has indicted three Serbs suspected of massacring patients at Vukovar hospital in November 1991, when the town fell to Serb forces. Milan Levar was a local official in Gospic when the Serb rebellion against Croatian independence began in the summer of 1991. He participated in the defence of the town, but was so appalled by the atrocities committed by his own forces that he felt compelled to speak out. Croatian forces have been accused of atrocities against Serb civilians in three instances: during the 1991 war, when Croatia lost a third of its territory to the Serbs, and during two rapid and successful campaigns to retake that territory in 1995. Levar named high-ranking Croatian army officers in a series of press articles in 1997, and accused them of the \"systematic murder\" of Serb civilians. The revelations caused shockwaves in a country whose population see themselves as the victims, not the perpetrators of the war. But more revelations about war crimes in Gospic followed, this time from Miroslav Bajramovic, another soldier involved in the defence of the town, who described how he took part in the torture and murder of dozens of Serbs. Last year a Zagreb court convicted Bajramovic and several others of lesser crimes, but dropped the more serious charges for lack of evidence. The possibilities open to the Hague tribunal widened enormously in January, when a new Social Democrat-Liberal government was elected, pledging full cooperation with investigators. In April this year, those investigators began to search for the graves of an estimated 120 Serbs in the Gospic area. In the Obradovic Varos suburb of Gospic, they exhumed the remains of 10 bodies, under close police protection. At the time, there were protest marches through the town, organised by veterans' associations, with banners reading \"Where were you in 1991?\" and \"Don't humiliate us\". \"How could Croatians have committed crimes when the town was besieged and took over 5,000 shells a day?\" one of the participants, Ante Djapic, leader of the extremist Croatian Party of Rights, said to reporters.",

But they serve as a reminder that Punch will have to work long and hard to achieve growth, in a market that is generally considered to be mature. It will take more than a few brightly coloured carpets, large-screen televisions and clean toilets to swim against the industry's tide. Staff who accept the invitation to buy shares in Punch should be prepared for a long haul. Eidos impasse A year ago the computer games company Eidos was the toast of the City with a high-flying share price and a confident management. Today it is almost impossible to find anyone who will say a nice word about the firm in the wake of successive profit warnings. Yesterday analysts, brokers, fund managers and legions of small shareholders were still none the wiser about the state of the takeover talks first announced almost three months ago. Even many of the company's own advisers seemed nonplussed. Chief operating officer Mike McGarvey was saying nothing. Even chief executive Charles Cornwall - briefly back in the UK having flown in from his Los Angeles home - wasn't talking, despite his firm being at such a crucial point. Some in the City doubt the \"talks\" are that serious. They want a resolution to the Eidos saga as soon as possible; they say that uncertainty surrounding the firm is having a negative effect on the whole of the quoted computer games sector - which is having a rough time in any case: a cyclical downturn in the market means not as many games are being bought. Mr Cornwall, a confrontational former investment banker, has other interests. He should put everyone out of their misery and get on with pursuing those interests instead.",

      "body": "<p>Yesterday Michael Portillo inadvertently raised the key question of the century. Can western democracies ever deliver the politics necessary to save the world? To stop global warming as it is now - just to halt it - world emissions of carbon dioxide have to be cut by between 60% and 80% according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change: targets set at Kyoto which some countries won't reach were a pathetically modest first step. But outside wartime, no democracy has ever asked its voters for such savage belt-tightening or such radical lifestyle change as would be required to get anywhere near that goal. </p> <p>Will it have to wait until citizens can see for themselves that climate change threatens them now, not in the future? Dying polar bears, water at the north pole, fires blazing across great tracts of land or even tropical diseases like West Nile fever breaking out in Boston make interesting newspaper stories, but they don't scare the people into a wartime frame of mind: presumably that will take water flooding over the spire of the Empire State Building. </p> <p>Michael Portillo yesterday said the Conservatives would abolish Labour's climate-change levy, a pollution tax that after three years of negotiation finally comes into force in April. It will create energy savings worth about a third of the Kyoto cuts Britain has to make in carbon emissions. It is not draconian, adding only 0.45p per unit to business energy bills. It will raise \u00a31.1bn, all of it to be recycled back to business. (It is not a Treasury money-maker). All employers will get the money back as a reduction in National Insurance contributions they pay for employees. The idea is an incentive to cut energy use, coupled with an incentive to employ more people.Ten per cent of it will be used for energy saving capital grants for business. </p> <p>This policy was led by Lord Marshall, then head of the CBI. It has undergone years of delicate negotiation to ensure it is fair. Industry persuaded Gordon Brown to halve the size of his original levy, making special agreements for 80% rebates for sectors that use vast quantities of energy but employ few people - steel, chemicals, engineering. Yesterday John Cridland, deputy director-general of the CBI, said it was not opposing the climate-change levy. </p> <p>The one and only supporter of Portillo's surprise announcement was the Institute of Directors. (Small business stands to gain from the NI cuts). Portillo's rousing rhetoric at the breakfast for business included these thoughts: \"There is no justification for an energy tax which is going to be particularly harmful to manufacturing industry. Business can no longer be the fall guy.\" He called the idea of taxing manufacturing industry \"ill-conceived\", \"counter-productive\" and \"crazy\". (Both he and the institute talked of manufacturing industry's dire plight due to the high pound, apparently shameless about their own part in Britain's failure to join the euro and rescue British manufacturing). </p> <p>But most important of all, Michael Portillo took no account of global warming. He simply criticised the levy as a tax on business. It is politics as usual, no change. At least, unlike the Republicans in America, the Conservatives don't deny the existence of global warming, nor the need to do something about it. But as oppositions do and always will, they deny the need for a particular belt-tightening measure the government of the day proposes. It's \"crazy\", needless, could be done better or in any other way but the one proposed. There will be a great array of methods governments choose to apply carrots and sticks to drive down energy use to hit their targets. But if oppositions always offer the people an excuse for not doing it, a reason for voting against any particular tax, quota or limit, nothing will be done. </p> <p> Portillo's \"alternative\" suggestion is typical weaselling. Instead of a tax, he said, his party would introduce \"emissions trading\" whereby companies are given carbon quotas they can buy and sell. It gives them a financial incentive for switching to more expensive clean energy sources such as wind or solar power that fall outside the quota. Good idea. Except that the government is already planning to do this and has a taskforce in place drawing up just such a scheme. So is the EU. But it will be needed side by side, not instead of, a climate-change levy because it wouldn't work without that incentive. It will take several years to introduce, during which time Portillo proposes nothing should be done. The danger is that in democracies people are easily seduced by apparently pain-free alternatives offered by oppositions, ensuring governments never quite dare take measures as tough as they know they should be to hit their targets. And that's the way the world ends. </p> <p>Consider the sort of lifestyle change we in the west will have to make to meet the 60-80% cut: a one-way flight from London to Miami uses up half the carbon emission a person would be allocated for a whole year's heating, cooking and transport. Will it require authoritarian national governments to introduce those kinds of severe changes, or can oppositions behave more responsibly and sit down with governments to agree global-warming measures? The Conservatives' desperate thrashing around at the moment for any vote-catcher, however disgraceful, doesn't bode well. </p> <p>Must it all be hard sacrifice? There's always a glint in the eye of the Greens that suggests they really relish anti-materialist, back-to-nature lifestyle cuts as a puritanical good thing in its own right. However, it is possible that a mixture of good government and new technology will mean nothing too drastic has to hit general standards of living. But as Michael Portillo must know, the longer action is delayed, the harsher the cuts that will need to be made later. </p> <p>The climate-change levy is an excellent tool to start large energy users thinking again about ways to convert their supplies to clean sources and to use less. For example, it will tip the balance in making it financially worthwhile for a new office building to invest in solar panels as a cladding that would give the building 30 years free electricity at no greater construction cost than most ornamental but useless cladding. (It looks like blue marble). The levy would tip the balance in encouraging any large energy user to invest in solar panels. The government is to use 10% of the levy for grants to help companies install this and other clean electricity supplies. </p> <p>The difference in cost between clean and dirty electricity is shrinking all the time, so that relatively small extra taxes can change energy use dramatically. How high do oil prices rise before electric cars look attractive? Maybe we shall fly less often, but then trains will improve to take up the international long-distance trade. But carrots and sticks will have to start the whole process. And oppositions that try to capitalise shamelessly on what all responsible governments must do deserve to be kept out of office indefinitely. </p> <p> polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</p>",

The difference in cost between clean and dirty electricity is shrinking all the time, so that relatively small extra taxes can change energy use dramatically. How high do oil prices rise before electric cars look attractive? Maybe we shall fly less often, but then trains will improve to take up the international long-distance trade. But carrots and sticks will have to start the whole process. And oppositions that try to capitalise shamelessly on what all responsible governments must do deserve to be kept out of office indefinitely. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

The 500 or so submarines of many nations that ply their stealthy way through the oceans may not seem a large number. But submarine competition between countries is a cause of problems and dangers worthy of sustained attention.</p> <p>This is an undersea world in which new technologies are barely under control at the same time as old technologies decay and collapse. It is also a world in which largely untested theories of offence and defence drive hugely expensive developments which could engender the very conflicts governments seek to avoid through the maintenance of naval strength.</p> <p>Submarines represent at the same time the least vulnerable way of carrying and launching nuclear weapons and the most effective way of limiting a nuclear strike by destroying some of the other side's ballistic missile submarines. Apart from their deterrent function, they are a vital element in maintaining control of the high seas. They are also vital in sea-based intervention - in the so-called \"expeditionary\" strategy to which most navies now subscribe, whether they see their job as mounting such expeditions or defeating them.</p> <p>The submarine, in other words, underpins deterrence, sustains sea control, and is critical in intervention. But one has to pause here to question the logic of all this.</p> <p>What was the Kursk doing in the Barents sea? It was presumably practising its main job, which is to protect Russian ballistic submarines from American attack submarines - perhaps also to attack American ballistic-missile submarines, if the balance between the two navies were ever to permit that. When you render down what the Kursk's captain wrote to the mother of one his young sailors, with its impressive phrases like \"battle capable\", this is what was meant: the Kursk's job was to ensure that Russia's ballistic submarines could launch as many nuclear missiles as possible at North America and western Europe.</p> <p>Why is Russia still doing this, when a nuclear war between the west and Russia has become inconceivable? The Russian navy has been run down to the point where its surface fleet is about the same size as Britain's, but it still has a large submarine force with deterrence as its main function.</p> <p>In part, Moscow goes on with this because submarines are something it was good at in the cold war. The new Akula class, extremely difficult to detect and powerfully armed, was giving western admirals nightmares as that conflict ended. In part, Moscow goes on with it because the United States' approach to nuclear arms control is lackadaisical and compromised by the recent infatuation with national missile defence. Those policies almost force Russia to continue to deploy nuclear weapons to which it is \"entitled,\" and which can be seen as bargaining chips in negotiations with America. Finally, of course, there is Vladimir Putin's desire to reform and strengthen Russia's military forces as a means of restoring its prestige, influence, and national pride.</p> <p>Reasons in plenty - but are any of them good enough, singly or altogether, to justify not just sending young men and boys to the bottom, but the risks run by the whole world when a nation at an economic and technological low attempts to keep a superpower navy at sea?</p> <p>There is a dangerous irrationality here, but it is not just Russian. Nuclear submarines are on the technological frontier. They are not easy things to keep going, as the Royal Navy has found: one of our submarines has been languishing unrepaired in Gibraltar since May, and some believe that nine of 12 of our non-ballistic boats are out of service at any one time. The French probably have similar problems. Chinese nuclear submarines rarely put to sea. When they do, fingers are crossed. Other countries, some of them even less capable of controlling the technology, are beginning to hanker after nuclear submarines.</p> <p>It is probably true that the only navy that can run a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines efficiently and safely is that of the US, but even there accidents have happened. When we thought we all had to do these things, such risks could be defended with a degree of plausibility that is lacking now. The costs, meanwhile, are large. The next generation of American nuclear submarines will cost $2bn each. Then there is the cost of disposing of obsolete craft. The terrible scale of the Russian problem is known, but the problem is not confined to them.</p> <p>Acquisition of submarines by countries which previously had few or none goes on. In most cases, governments seek to buy conventional submarines - but they do so in part to counter the advantage of countries which have nuclear-powered submarines. Developments initially to do with deterrence are thus closely linked with those to do with conventional conflicts.</p> <p>The strategy, or rather strategies, that have emerged divide the globe into two classes - those who can project power, and those who wish to frustrate that projection. Submarines are arguably the most important single instrument for both classes. For the supreme power projector, the US, the submarine is a valuable collector of intelligence, the safest platform for precision strikes against land targets and a vital protector of surface ships.</p> <p>Those who aspire to some capacity to project power, like Russia, China, Britain and France, follow, at a huge remove, down this American road. But, equally, for those who want to offer effective resistance to a descent on their shores by the forces of the US, American-led coalitions, or other big countries, the submarine is the weapon of choice.</p> <p>Improved propulsion systems for conventional submarines which give them more endurance and make them harder to detect, as well as better weapons and targeting techniques, mean that relatively weak countries can mount a serious threat to expeditionary forces, including the nuclear submarines that accompany them. Where such intervention depends on an assurance of low casualties, such threats might be effective.</p> <p>As the cold war ended, a British naval officer wrote that \"we are going to need a strategy that doesn't start with the Threat\". There have been, and continue to be, ways in which sea power can enhance the security of the nations, stop or limit conflicts, rescue people in trouble or bring aid to them. But the pity is that we have held on to \"the Threat\" by maintaining, on both sides, submarine forces built around the deterrent. Even if those forces are somewhat reduced, they are surely still indefensible. At the same time we could face a new naval race between intervening powers and those who would resist them. There are indeed dragons under the sea.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

When you render down what the Kursk's captain wrote to the mother of one his young sailors, with its impressive phrases like \"battle capable\", this is what was meant: the Kursk's job was to ensure that Russia's ballistic submarines could launch as many nuclear missiles as possible at North America and western Europe. Why is Russia still doing this, when a nuclear war between the west and Russia has become inconceivable? The Russian navy has been run down to the point where its surface fleet is about the same size as Britain's, but it still has a large submarine force with deterrence as its main function. In part, Moscow goes on with this because submarines are something it was good at in the cold war. The new Akula class, extremely difficult to detect and powerfully armed, was giving western admirals nightmares as that conflict ended. In part, Moscow goes on with it because the United States' approach to nuclear arms control is lackadaisical and compromised by the recent infatuation with national missile defence. Those policies almost force Russia to continue to deploy nuclear weapons to which it is \"entitled,\" and which can be seen as bargaining chips in negotiations with America. Finally, of course, there is Vladimir Putin's desire to reform and strengthen Russia's military forces as a means of restoring its prestige, influence, and national pride. Reasons in plenty - but are any of them good enough, singly or altogether, to justify not just sending young men and boys to the bottom, but the risks run by the whole world when a nation at an economic and technological low attempts to keep a superpower navy at sea? There is a dangerous irrationality here, but it is not just Russian. Nuclear submarines are on the technological frontier. They are not easy things to keep going, as the Royal Navy has found: one of our submarines has been languishing unrepaired in Gibraltar since May, and some believe that nine of 12 of our non-ballistic boats are out of service at any one time. The French probably have similar problems. Chinese nuclear submarines rarely put to sea. When they do, fingers are crossed. Other countries, some of them even less capable of controlling the technology, are beginning to hanker after nuclear submarines. It is probably true that the only navy that can run a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines efficiently and safely is that of the US, but even there accidents have happened. When we thought we all had to do these things, such risks could be defended with a degree of plausibility that is lacking now. The costs, meanwhile, are large. The next generation of American nuclear submarines will cost $2bn each. Then there is the cost of disposing of obsolete craft. The terrible scale of the Russian problem is known, but the problem is not confined to them. Acquisition of submarines by countries which previously had few or none goes on. In most cases, governments seek to buy conventional submarines - but they do so in part to counter the advantage of countries which have nuclear-powered submarines. Developments initially to do with deterrence are thus closely linked with those to do with conventional conflicts. The strategy, or rather strategies, that have emerged divide the globe into two classes - those who can project power, and those who wish to frustrate that projection. Submarines are arguably the most important single instrument for both classes. For the supreme power projector, the US, the submarine is a valuable collector of intelligence, the safest platform for precision strikes against land targets and a vital protector of surface ships. Those who aspire to some capacity to project power, like Russia, China, Britain and France, follow, at a huge remove, down this American road. But, equally, for those who want to offer effective resistance to a descent on their shores by the forces of the US, American-led coalitions, or other big countries, the submarine is the weapon of choice. Improved propulsion systems for conventional submarines which give them more endurance and make them harder to detect, as well as better weapons and targeting techniques, mean that relatively weak countries can mount a serious threat to expeditionary forces, including the nuclear submarines that accompany them. Where such intervention depends on an assurance of low casualties, such threats might be effective. As the cold war ended, a British naval officer wrote that \"we are going to need a strategy that doesn't start with the Threat\". There have been, and continue to be, ways in which sea power can enhance the security of the nations, stop or limit conflicts, rescue people in trouble or bring aid to them. But the pity is that we have held on to \"the Threat\" by maintaining, on both sides, submarine forces built around the deterrent. Even if those forces are somewhat reduced, they are surely still indefensible. At the same time we could face a new naval race between intervening powers and those who would resist them. There are indeed dragons under the sea. martin.woollacott@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "France will exploit its current position as EU president this weekend to push for sanctions against Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia to be watered down or even dropped, a move which Britain opposes strongly. The timing of the initiative is particularly sensitive since Yugoslav parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held on September 24 and supporters of the sanctions believe that any change in policy now risks boosting Mr Milosevic's popularity. Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, is likely to find himself virtually isolated, however, when he meets his European counterparts this weekend for a meeting in the French resort of Evian. Only the Netherlands and Denmark are said to back Britain's hard line and other countries have made no secret of the fact that they believe the sanctions are flawed and ineffective. Although the Evian meeting is informal and is not expected to yield any concrete decisions, the Foreign Office will be aware that such meetings are often used to pave the way for formal decisions shortly afterwards. Consensus on the sanctions - which include an oil embargo, a ban on doing business with most Yugoslav firms, and travel restrictions on government officials - crumbled in July at a similar EU meeting. Hubert V\u00e9drine, the French foreign minister, said in a recent letter to European foreign ministers: \"It's obvious that our action (towards Serbia) has not yielded the desired results and that several of us are of the opinion that some of the measures we have imposed like the sanctions remain ineffective and even counter-productive. \"It will be indispensable to evaluate our policy on the eve of these very important elections.\" The stated aim of the sanctions was to undermine Mr Milosevic but many countries are convinced that they have served only to impoverish ordinary Serbs and have allowed the Yugoslav strongman to portray himself and his country as the victim of international bullying. Britain begs to differ, however, and believes that the current \"carrot and stick\" approach which is designed to hurt the Milosevic regime while simultaneously promoting democracy should be continued. Foreign Office officials played down the prospect of confrontation on the issue and said they had no problem discussing different scenarios for action after the elections. They acknowledged, however, that they were still \"firmly\" opposed to any move to lift the sanctions. \"You've got to play this incredibly carefully because Mr Milosevic has made a career of pretending that Yugoslavia is being bullied,\" one official said. Serbia is not the only subject on the agenda this weekend. France is expected to float for the first time a controversial idea to hold yet another landmark EU summit to reform the 15-nation bloc.

Three young men set upon the Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano in a park in the eastern city of Dessau on June 11 and kicked him for so long and so hard that he died from his injuries three days later. His murder helped jolt Germany's political leaders into a new assessment of the threat posed by the extreme right. Adriano's German-born wife Angelika was not in court on Wednesday for the sentencing of her husband's murderers. The eldest of the three racist thugs who attacked him was given a life sentence. His two 16-year-old accomplices got nine years each. John Greene, an American who represents an anti-discrimination group in Dessau, said yesterday that Ms Adriano left her home on Saturday. \"I know that she planned it after receiving threatening telephone calls. Then a letter came threatening her life and the lives of her children,\" he said. A leader of the immigrant community in Dessau said the writer of the letter had threatened to blow up the flat she shares with her three children, the youngest of whom is six months old. The letter also abused her for having married an African and said her children would be infected with Aids as a result. Against a background of spreading European concern about the far right, Mr Schr\u00f6der was joined yesterday by the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, on a visit to Dessau. The visit was intended to highlight the German government's determination to curb neo-Nazism. Mr Schr\u00f6der laid a wreath of yellow flowers at the little monument which local officials have erected at the site of the murder. But, astonishingly, no arrangements were made for the chancellor to meet Mrs Adriano. Nor did he have any but the most fleeting contact with those working against racism in the city: he shook hands with the head of the city's multi-cultural institute. Nobody doubts his determination to tackle far-right violence, but he will have his hands full: xenophobia seems to be entrenched in many regions of Germany, particularly in the east. Heinz Wolf, a retired man, who watched Mr Schr\u00f6der lay his tribute of flowers, said he had little respect for the gesture. \"This won't change anything,\" he said.\"Why do we bring so many foreigners here when we have enough problems ourselves?\" Today Mr Schr\u00f6der will reach the end of a marathon tour of eastern Germany which has been dominated by the issue of far-right violence. Yet not a single meeting with race-relations workers has figured on his itinerary. Nor is there any evidence of his having discussed the issue with members of the immigrant community. As he visited Dessau, a new race row erupted in the state parliament in Hesse, the region which includes Frankfurt. The local leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) made a formal apology after Green party members claimed that a Christian Democrat MP had told a foreign-born Green MP to go back where he came from. They said that during a heated debate Tarek al-Wazir, who has German citizenship and a Yemeni father, was told to \"go back to Sana'a\". CDU members said that the phrase had been misheard, but the leader of their parliamentary group made an unconditional apology. Elsewhere, police in the eastern town of Cottbus reported that a group of youths shouting \"Sieg Heil\" and giving the Nazi salute had tossed two crude Molotov cocktails on to the footbpath in front of a building housing a youth club called \"Multi-cultural Europe\".

There are a couple of loose ends (one involves an ad campaign for new Cadbury's Snowflake) which we will tie up on Tuesday... when we will also bid farewell to that doughtiest of August space-fillers, the amusing tourist attraction. \u0095 Perhaps predictably, meanwhile, the special report on our trip to Leeds in the Rolls-Royce convertible RR1 provided another triumph for our fact-checkers. The ex-Labour councillor featured is Garth Frankland, not Gareth. He was not expelled from the Labour party, but left to join the Left Alliance. Cowper St School is in Chapeltown, not Middleton. I could go on. But I won't. I haven't the strength. \u0095 For all those sneerers who believe that Lottery Commission chair Dame Helena Shovelton appeared confused about what to do with the franchise, there is an explanation. One of the quango queen's other gigs is as a member of the Competition Commission, former Monopolies and Mergers. Half the time she's trying to break monopolies, in other words, the other half she's trying to award the juiciest monopoly of them all. Poor old thing, no wonder she doesn't know whether she's Arthur or Martha.",

In the past year or so Lord Lloyd Webber, the force behind some of the most successful musicals in history including Phantom of the Opera, Cats and Starlight Express, has built up his portfolio of London theatres to 13. His Really Useful theatre group has bought the Stoll Moss business, ownerof the Theatre Royal Drury Lane and several other properties, with the backing of private equity group Bridgepoint Capital for around \u00a387m. SFX, the sports and entertainment operation recently bought by Clear Channel, has taken over the Apollo group. Producer Cameron Mackintosh has expanded his portfolio while Howard Pante and Peter Beckwith's Ambassador Group now owns nine theatres. Adam Maidment of Bridgepoint Capital believes West End theatres are an increasingly sound investment. \"West End theatre audiences over the past 20 or 30 years have always remained at reasonably consistent levels,\" he said. \"Audience levels seem to be insensitive to economic upswings and downswings.\" Bridgepoint believes theatres can also be put to better use - for concerts and conferences - during quiet times when live performances are not taking place. \"Venues like the Theatre Royal and the Palladium are spectacular, unique assets known the world over and yet historically they have been largely underutilised.\" Players - Who owns the West End Really Useful Group Apollo, Adelphi, Cambridge, Duchess, Drury Lane, Garrick, Gielgud, Her Majesty's, New London, London Palladium, Lyric, Palace, Queen's Ambassadors Theatre Group Albery, Comedy, Donmar, Duke of York's, New Ambassadors, Phoenix, Piccadilly, Whitehall, Wyndham's SFX Apollo Victoria, Dominion, London Apollo Hammersmith, Lyceum Cameron Mackintosh Prince of Wales, Prince Edward.

Ms Hancock said the college was encouraged by most of the proposals in the NHS plan and supported the principle of extending free nursing care. \"However, we are concerned that flaws in the approach to long term care funding will continue to undermine the potential benefits of such measures for the health and wellbeing of all older people,\" she said. The Department of Health said ministers had not yet received the college's letter. They were proposing a broad definition of nursing care that would for the first time be free in all care homes. The college would be involved in drawing up a framework for assessing every resident's nursing needs, a spokeswoman said.",

Verdict: With 60g of sugar per 100g of jam, the sweetness isn't surprising (the fruit component is 40g:100g). But that's not really the novelty nicety about this product. It's the squeezability of the pouch. You can squeeze this goo from the colostomy bag lookalike straight onto toast, rice puddings or crumpets, spoon or finger. It's convenient and mess free. Price: 99p per 340g pouch.",

      "bodyText": "David Shayler, the former MI5 officer, has told the police special branch he is willing to help their investigation into the alleged involvement of MI6 in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader Colonel Gadafy, but only so long as they are given full access to security and intelligence service files. Commander Roger Pearce, head of the Metropolitan police special branch, said this month that he wanted to interview Mr Shayler about the allegation. Yesterday, John Wadham, Mr Shayler's lawyer and director of Liberty, the civil rights group, wrote to Cdr Pearce saying they needed to ensure \"first, that the security service (MI5) and the secret intelligence service (MI6) have already agreed that they will both make relevant officers available for interview; secondly, that both those organisations have agreed to make all relevant records, documents and other materials available to you\". In separate letters, Mr Wadham has asked Jack Straw (home secretary) and Robin Cook (foreign secretary) for their assurances that special branch officers would be given \"proper and unrestricted access\" to MI5 and MI6 files. Details of alleged MI6 involvement in the Gadafy plot of 1996 - including the names of two MI6 officers - were sent to Mr Straw by Mr Shayler last November. Five months ago, they were handed to Scotland Yard by Annie Machon, Mr Shayler's girlfriend, also a former MI5 officer. A secret MI6 report, dated 1995, confirming one of the plotters had approached an MI6 officer about the conspiracy and containing details of it was posted on the internet earlier this year. Mr Shayler has been charged with original allegations he made about MI5 to the Mail on Sunday in August 1997 and with disclosing MI5 documents. He has not been charged in connection with his Gadafy plot allegations. Scotland Yard said the inquiry into the allegations was at an \"early stage\".",

      "bodyText": "The man responsible for devising a voting system for 21st century Britain has admitted for the first time that Tony Blair will never concede to Liberal Democrat demands for proportional representation in general elections. Lord Jenkins of Hillhead said he recognised that the Labour party had effectively ruled out adopting the \"AV-plus\" system proposed two years ago by the electoral reform commission, which he chaired at the personal request of the prime minister. The Liberal Democrat peer and former SDP leader said he was disappointed but not surprised that his proposal had been given a lukewarm response at Labour's national policy forum last month. But it was a lesson of history, he said, that political parties rarely had the courage to do anything that might damage their electoral prospects \"when they have the power to do so\". His comments sparked fears that the Liberal Democrats' policy of collaboration with the government on issues of constitutional reform would come under fire at next month's party conference from activists who believe the party is reaping little in the way of rewards in return for cooperating with Labour. Under a deal brokered by the cabinet office minister Lord Falconer at the policy forum meeting, Labour's official policy document says that further electoral reform should be delayed until the new voting systems in Scotland and Wales have been \"thoroughly examined\" and stresses the party's belief in the direct link between MPs and their constituencies. But the Lib Dem peer Lord Russell insisted that Lord Jenkins's remarks would not damage relations between the two parties, which at present collaborate on the joint cabinet committee on constitutional reform. He said: \"At the moment, the anti-PR faction in the Labour party is clearly on top but the wheel of fortune never stops turning. I don't think anything will happen unless Tony Blair has a serious fear of losing office. Charles Kennedy [the Lib Dem leader] must not burn any boats.\" Despite Labour's continuing commitment to a referendum on electoral reform, there is speculation that voters will be asked whether they are in favour of adopting the alternative vote, or \"AV\", a system which requires voters to mark their ballot papers in order of preference and redistributes second and third preferences until one candidate has 50% of the vote. If AV had been in place in 1997, it would have given Labour an even larger majority than the landslide which it actually won. Under Lord Jenkins's AV-plus system, however, most MPs would represent particular seats, but up to 100 MPs would be elected on a proportional vote without specific constituencies. A spokesman for Mr Kennedy said: \"We have always said this is a matter for the Labour party to decide. They have clearly not come to a decision yet and we have every confidence that they will not renege on their promise.\" The Labour MP Stephen Twigg, a member of the pro-PR group Make Votes Count, said: \"These comments don't change anything.

In 1978, Champernowne retired, though he remained an emeritus professor and a fellow of Trinity College. When he fell ill in his final years, he and Mieke moved from Cambridge to Budleigh Salterton, Devon, to be closer to one of his two sons, who, with his wife, survive him. \u0095 David Gawen Champernowne, economist, born July 9 1912; died August 19 2000",

The part of Douce de Bonaf\u00e9 was played by Odette Joyeux, who has died aged 85.</p> <p>Joyeux was the ideal actress to play the role. She was small, and appeared to be delicate; her features were those of an adolescent, sulking and grumbling. But this apparent fragility concealed determination, a readiness to revolt, and a capacity for refusal. And this was Joyeux herself. She was small, slim, apparently shy and reserved. But in reality she had a strong personality and was always determined to get her own way. She described herself as \"very violent and bad-tempered\".</p> <p>She was ambitious, and one ambition succeeded another. She wanted to make her way as a dancer, then as an actress, both on the stage and in films.

Towards the end of her life she produced scenarios for television.</p> <p>It was said that this ambition originated in the poverty of her origins. Born in Paris at the beginning of the first world war, Joyeux was the daughter of an unmarried washerwoman. But from the start she was irresistible, and at the age of seven she had persuaded one of her mother's acquaintances to help her gain admission to the Paris School of Opera. Thus she became what was called \"un petit rat de l'Op\u00e9ra\".</p> <p>She had talent as well as charm, and enjoyed a moment of glory when she danced a divertissement composed by Poulenc. She also had her rebellious streak, and this career came to an end when she was expelled because she refused to accept the school's strict discipline. Although re-instated, she decided to seek success elsewhere and determined to be an actress.</p> <p>With characteristic boldness the 16-year-old Joyeux applied for an audition with Louis Jouvet, France's leading actor and producer. The play was Intermezzo by Jean Giraudoux. She was successful and played the demanding role of Isabelle, a school-teacher in a small town where strange things were happening - the poorest person wins the lottery, only the old and unpleasant die, people reply truthfully to official enquiries. It was remarkable that the young, inexperienced girl should be chosen to play in this sophisticated drama, and chosen both by Jouvet and by Giraudoux himself. But, recalling this, she was businesslike.

Among her films are Marc Allegret's Entr\u00e9e des Artistes (1938); several other films with Autant-Lara - Le Mariage de Chiffon (1941), Lettres d'Amour (1942), Sylvie et le Fantme (1946); Max Oph\u00fcls's La Ronde (1950); and Sacha Guitry's Si Paris m'\u00e9tait Cont\u00e9 (1955).</p> <p>An episode in her life was made by Joyeux into a series of stories with which she regaled several generations. In 1935 the actor and playwright Pierre Brasseur was looking for a young girl to star in his new play, Grisou. He auditioned Joyeux and fell in love with her.

      "body": "<p>Not content with sending our convicts to Australia, we are now transporting our sitcom stars. For crimes unspecified, Martin Clunes and Neil Morrissey were packed off to be <strong> Men Down Under</strong> (BBC1), and spent 50 minutes driving around the north-eastern corner of the continent in search of the legendary Australian male. They didn't find him. A show that set out to examine masculinity in its antipodean form came up with precious little material, and instead of insights or even discussions we were treated to an extended Clunes/Morrissey holiday video. This was not unpleasant. Clunes has that kind of easy, clubman's repartee that would make him the perfect travelling companion, while Morrissey seems to be the kind of lad who likes a drink or two. They got on well with the locals in such unpromising spots as Cairns and Alice Springs, and didn't try too hard to live up to their Men Behaving Badly personae. </p> <p>But after 30 minutes or so in which nothing had happened, the novelty was beginning to wear off. We saw Martin Clunes playing golf very badly for an agonising five minutes, while Morrissey visited a swimming pool that was hilariously closed. We saw some camels, and learned that they have smelly breath. We met a man who has made a lot of money from running a diving club, despite getting bad school reports. All of this could have been achieved a good deal closer to home. </p> <p>Clunes and Morrissey are lovely blokes and great actors, but without a script they don't make very exciting television. It's not enough simply to take a couple of familiar faces and send them somewhere hot - they have to be able to do something once they're there. Paul O'Grady's recent travels round the Far East worked because he was liable to blow a gasket at any moment - besides which, O'Grady is a great improvisational raconteur. Clunes and Morrissey aren't, and seemed for much of the time to be lost for words. They redeemed themselves in the show's final five minutes by getting slurringly drunk at a tent fight, during which we were treated to the edifying sight of two ageing tattooed men sitting on each other's faces. Were these the legendary \"real Australian men\" we'd been promised? Our hosts were too pissed to care. </p> <p>Much more exotic fare came in the final part of <strong> EastEnders</strong>' Spanish trilogy (BBC1). Walford's love-crossed seniors returned to Albert Square, but not before treating us to some of the best soap of the year. Pat and Frank's erotic reunion was interrupted by Irene, sending the two fun-sized lovers scrambling into their clothes in a muck sweat of guilt. So flustered was Pat that she lost one of her earrings, and spent the next few minutes looking strangely denuded with her unadorned lobe. The tell-tale trinket turned up on the back of Peggy's pashmina, whence it was retrieved by Frank in a fake embrace. The scene, like the whole episode, teetered just on the right side of farce, and never more so than when Frank attempted to follow Pat into an aeroplane toilet. \"Don't even think about it!\" said Pat, but not before we'd all had a vision of two very large people squeezed into a very small cubicle. </p> <p>Irene, of course, rode off into the sunset in a nifty red jeep, having chosen a life of economic uncertainty in Spain over domestic misery with Terry. \"Please, make a choice ...\" begged Terry, while the viewing nation bellowed \"Take the jeep!\" </p> <p>Ricky Tomlinson and Paterson Joseph made a promising double-act in <strong> Safe as Houses</strong> (ITV), a one-off drama that would be welcome back as a series. Tomlinson, his hair longer and more luxuriant than ever, was in muted mood as Lawrence, a former master butcher now ekeing out a living as a home security rep. Joseph was his odious boss Gabriel, a salesman who had fallen for his own patter and lost his wife as a result. Together they visited a series of unlucky householders - one of them Dora Bryan in the funniest cameo of the week - until they found themselves inexplicably bound and gagged at the mercy of a gun-wielding maniac. It was up to Tomlinson to talk his way out of that one, which he did, in an impressive set-piece that just proves that the art of TV-acting is alive and well and only waiting for some decent material.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Not content with sending our convicts to Australia, we are now transporting our sitcom stars. For crimes unspecified, Martin Clunes and Neil Morrissey were packed off to be Men Down Under (BBC1), and spent 50 minutes driving around the north-eastern corner of the continent in search of the legendary Australian male. They didn't find him. A show that set out to examine masculinity in its antipodean form came up with precious little material, and instead of insights or even discussions we were treated to an extended Clunes/Morrissey holiday video. This was not unpleasant. Clunes has that kind of easy, clubman's repartee that would make him the perfect travelling companion, while Morrissey seems to be the kind of lad who likes a drink or two. They got on well with the locals in such unpromising spots as Cairns and Alice Springs, and didn't try too hard to live up to their Men Behaving Badly personae. But after 30 minutes or so in which nothing had happened, the novelty was beginning to wear off. We saw Martin Clunes playing golf very badly for an agonising five minutes, while Morrissey visited a swimming pool that was hilariously closed. We saw some camels, and learned that they have smelly breath. We met a man who has made a lot of money from running a diving club, despite getting bad school reports. All of this could have been achieved a good deal closer to home. Clunes and Morrissey are lovely blokes and great actors, but without a script they don't make very exciting television. It's not enough simply to take a couple of familiar faces and send them somewhere hot - they have to be able to do something once they're there. Paul O'Grady's recent travels round the Far East worked because he was liable to blow a gasket at any moment - besides which, O'Grady is a great improvisational raconteur. Clunes and Morrissey aren't, and seemed for much of the time to be lost for words. They redeemed themselves in the show's final five minutes by getting slurringly drunk at a tent fight, during which we were treated to the edifying sight of two ageing tattooed men sitting on each other's faces. Were these the legendary \"real Australian men\" we'd been promised? Our hosts were too pissed to care. Much more exotic fare came in the final part of EastEnders' Spanish trilogy (BBC1). Walford's love-crossed seniors returned to Albert Square, but not before treating us to some of the best soap of the year. Pat and Frank's erotic reunion was interrupted by Irene, sending the two fun-sized lovers scrambling into their clothes in a muck sweat of guilt. So flustered was Pat that she lost one of her earrings, and spent the next few minutes looking strangely denuded with her unadorned lobe. The tell-tale trinket turned up on the back of Peggy's pashmina, whence it was retrieved by Frank in a fake embrace. The scene, like the whole episode, teetered just on the right side of farce, and never more so than when Frank attempted to follow Pat into an aeroplane toilet. \"Don't even think about it!\" said Pat, but not before we'd all had a vision of two very large people squeezed into a very small cubicle. Irene, of course, rode off into the sunset in a nifty red jeep, having chosen a life of economic uncertainty in Spain over domestic misery with Terry. \"Please, make a choice ...\" begged Terry, while the viewing nation bellowed \"Take the jeep!\" Ricky Tomlinson and Paterson Joseph made a promising double-act in Safe as Houses (ITV), a one-off drama that would be welcome back as a series. Tomlinson, his hair longer and more luxuriant than ever, was in muted mood as Lawrence, a former master butcher now ekeing out a living as a home security rep. Joseph was his odious boss Gabriel, a salesman who had fallen for his own patter and lost his wife as a result. Together they visited a series of unlucky householders - one of them Dora Bryan in the funniest cameo of the week - until they found themselves inexplicably bound and gagged at the mercy of a gun-wielding maniac. It was up to Tomlinson to talk his way out of that one, which he did, in an impressive set-piece that just proves that the art of TV-acting is alive and well and only waiting for some decent material.",

But this week Winkler is proud to abandon his career on the land for a holiday spent standing up for what he believes in.

This, should there be any misunderstanding, is a description borrowed from Butler's lawyer.</p> <p>Business is going well enough for the God-fearing Winkler, though fear is probably an emotion stirred more readily when the church you attend every Sunday has as its centrepiece a bust of Adolf Hitler. \"I go to people's houses, they call me up and ask me to come back again,\" he says. \"I must be doing something right.\" Any non-white customers might not agree, but that is beside the point: he doesn't have any. Non-whites are statistically negligible in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and if it were otherwise Winkler would not choose to live in this town.</p> <p>Business for Butler, on the other hand, has never been worse. Twenty-five years after he moved to northern Idaho, a finger of land inserted between Washington state to the west, Montana to the east and Canada to the north, his movement is close to being crushed. His foe is not the wave of racial impurity, against which he has inveighed for so long, but the law, albeit in an action brought by a Jewish civil rights attorney.

Last September he blew \u00a311m at Crockford casino in London - the largest single loss in British gambling history. Packer gambles as much as \u00a3100,000 per hand, and may have two hands going at the same time. He once, famously, lent the actor George Hamilton \u00a3125,000 in chips, then refused repayment.

A taxi driver described roadblocks at which UN soldiers sit in the shade while drunken or drugged young men wielding machetes and guns rob drivers and abuse civilians.</p> <p>\"If you see the West Side Boys at the checkpoint it is very bad news,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They just point their guns in your face and ask what you have in your pockets and the UN soldiers don't do anything.</p> <p>\"I don't think they could just kill you there, because that would be too much, but you know that if they want to kill you a mile down the road the UN won't do anything, because they are so friendly with these guys.\"</p> <p>The West Side Boys are what is known in Freetown as \"self-provisioning\". They are notorious for robbery, extortion, abduction and rape. They are believed to be holding several hundred civilians, some of them wealthy businessmen snatched from their cars on the main road into Freetown and held for ransom.</p> <p>Many women and girls are raped and held as sex slaves.</p> <p>Last month the UN sent Nigerian troops and Indian helicopter gunships to clear the West Side Boys from the road and press them to demobilise. Despite a heavy bombardment of the Occra Hills, where the renegades are camped, the abuses began again almost immediately.</p> <p>Some in the UN believe the West Side Boys were tipped off that the attack was coming and withdrew to a safe area.</p> <p>\"I do not think collaboration is too strong a word to describe what is happening,\" a UN official who regularly drives the road to visit refugees said.</p> <p>\"The Jordanians are feeding those guys and socialising with them without thinking that these are the same ones who are killing people and raping girls. Some of us have commented on this inside the UN and said we can't just have our soldiers stand by and let it happen, but we are told that we have to build confidence so [that] they give up their guns and join the demobilisation process.\"</p> <p>A UN spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Coker, declined to comment beyond saying: \"It's not true.\"</p> <p>The British have had close contact with the group in recent months.</p> <p>When the war flared up again in May, British officers were so desperate to find fighters to defend the government that the West Side Boys were supplied with large amounts of ammunition, and food and medicines.</p> <p>During a crucial battle at Rogberi Junction, a British lieutenant-colonel directed the West Side Boys attack on the rebels.</p> <p>But relations soured as the renegades showed little enthusiasm for putting themselves under the direct command of the government's new army.</p> <p>In June, West Side Boys fighters turned their guns on government troops during a battle for another town, Lunsar. The dispute was about rank: the renegades wanted to keep the grand ranks - they have a lot of \"brigadiers\" - they had awarded themselves in the bush.</p> <p>The hostility and suspicion grew when two of their leaders were arrested last month after a gun battle in Freetown over the ownership of a car which once belonged to the captured Revolutionary United Front leader, Foday Sankoh.</p> <p>A number of the West Side Boys have been accepted for training by the British as soldiers in Sierra Leone's new army, despite the gang's catalogue of human rights abuses.</p> <p>Before the war restarted, Britain had made plans for carefully screening recruits for the new force.</p> <p>With the upsurge in fighting, they felt it necessary to recruit any willing soldier, particularly those with experience, and that included many from groups such as the West Side Boys and the kamajor militias, as well as members of the former government army who were responsible for an array of atrocities, such as amputations and murdering children.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UN peacekeepers responsible for security in the area where the West Side Boys abducted 11 British soldiers and a Sierra Leonean officer a week ago continue to jointly man checkpoints with them, at which civilians are robbed and abused. The seizure of the British troops, five of whom were freed on Wednesday night, has also raised questions about the fate of hundreds of Sierra Leoneans held by the West Side Boys, who have robbed and raped with virtual impunity in recent months. Human Rights Watch accuses the UN of appeasing the renegade soldiers and former prisoners who make up most of the West Side Boys fighters while entire villages are depopulated by civilians fleeing in fear. At least five UN checkpoints in the Masiaka area continue to be manned by Jordanian peacekeepers while armed West Side Boys are present or in control. A taxi driver described roadblocks at which UN soldiers sit in the shade while drunken or drugged young men wielding machetes and guns rob drivers and abuse civilians. \"If you see the West Side Boys at the checkpoint it is very bad news,\" he said. \"They just point their guns in your face and ask what you have in your pockets and the UN soldiers don't do anything. \"I don't think they could just kill you there, because that would be too much, but you know that if they want to kill you a mile down the road the UN won't do anything, because they are so friendly with these guys.\" The West Side Boys are what is known in Freetown as \"self-provisioning\". They are notorious for robbery, extortion, abduction and rape. They are believed to be holding several hundred civilians, some of them wealthy businessmen snatched from their cars on the main road into Freetown and held for ransom. Many women and girls are raped and held as sex slaves. Last month the UN sent Nigerian troops and Indian helicopter gunships to clear the West Side Boys from the road and press them to demobilise. Despite a heavy bombardment of the Occra Hills, where the renegades are camped, the abuses began again almost immediately. Some in the UN believe the West Side Boys were tipped off that the attack was coming and withdrew to a safe area. \"I do not think collaboration is too strong a word to describe what is happening,\" a UN official who regularly drives the road to visit refugees said. \"The Jordanians are feeding those guys and socialising with them without thinking that these are the same ones who are killing people and raping girls. Some of us have commented on this inside the UN and said we can't just have our soldiers stand by and let it happen, but we are told that we have to build confidence so [that] they give up their guns and join the demobilisation process.\" A UN spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Coker, declined to comment beyond saying: \"It's not true.\" The British have had close contact with the group in recent months. When the war flared up again in May, British officers were so desperate to find fighters to defend the government that the West Side Boys were supplied with large amounts of ammunition, and food and medicines. During a crucial battle at Rogberi Junction, a British lieutenant-colonel directed the West Side Boys attack on the rebels. But relations soured as the renegades showed little enthusiasm for putting themselves under the direct command of the government's new army. In June, West Side Boys fighters turned their guns on government troops during a battle for another town, Lunsar. The dispute was about rank: the renegades wanted to keep the grand ranks - they have a lot of \"brigadiers\" - they had awarded themselves in the bush. The hostility and suspicion grew when two of their leaders were arrested last month after a gun battle in Freetown over the ownership of a car which once belonged to the captured Revolutionary United Front leader, Foday Sankoh. A number of the West Side Boys have been accepted for training by the British as soldiers in Sierra Leone's new army, despite the gang's catalogue of human rights abuses. Before the war restarted, Britain had made plans for carefully screening recruits for the new force. With the upsurge in fighting, they felt it necessary to recruit any willing soldier, particularly those with experience, and that included many from groups such as the West Side Boys and the kamajor militias, as well as members of the former government army who were responsible for an array of atrocities, such as amputations and murdering children.",

Estimates by the Department of Health have put deaths from air pollution in Britain at 10,000 a year. Yesterday, as a result of the paper, Friends of the Earth said that the number of British deaths was probably 19,000 a year.

Like the cabinet war rooms - visited by thousands of tourists - a war command has been set up in an unused Westminster basement near MI5 headquarters. Forty or so civil servants man a nerve centre overseeing life and death for some 12,000 pigs. The three room centre has three crisis desks; a kitchen cabinet table; a map room and an operations centre to check the disease has not spread. This is run by Gary, more usually overseeing the checking of passports for pets at Dover. But his reports will eventually lead to the all-clear to end the crisis. The map room contains large ordnance survey maps of East Anglia, with infected areas marked out. All that is missing is a bed so the cabinet minister in charge, Nick Brown, can sleep overnight if the crisis got out of hand. But so far this has proved unnecessary. Yesterday was the 19th consecutive day when no new outbreak had been confirmed. So far five outbreaks have been confirmed and 69 others checked out - with 44 cleared and restrictions lifted. The politically incorrect slogan on the board in Pig Command is \"Get 'em off\" - a phrase referring to the seven days it took to lift restrictions on farms outside the five original outbreak areas. The areas suffering the worst restrictions are in the constituencies of three Tory ex-agriculture ministers -Gillian Shephard; John Gummer and John Macgregor. The fourth area takes in the constituency of Tim Yeo, the shadow agricultural spokesman. Mr Brown - who with his department's chief veterinary officer and many of his civil servants cancelled their summer holidays at the last moment - is pleased that the issue has not become the main \"silly season\" story. \"By stamping on the problem at once we seem to have stopped it, touch wood, from spreading and turning it into a crisis. \"If someone had not taken charge Whitehall would not have known what to do and the whole thing - because it is highly infectious among pigs - could have spread everywhere.\" He said he had obtained millions of pounds of government cash - \u00a335 per infected pig and \u00a310 per piglet - to compensate farmers in the five infected areas from today.",

The range was used by army tanks during the second world war and, since 1959, by the RAF to train pilots. Erosion forced its closure in 1998. The cliffs at RAF Cowden are falling into the sea at the rate of around 1.5m to 2m each year, making the erosion among the most drastic in Europe.",

      "bodyText": "Indonesia's attempt to try its former dictator Suharto for corruption stumbled at the first hurdle yesterday when, as expected, the man who ruled the country for 32 years failed to appear for the opening hearing, citing poor health. The millions of Indonesians who stopped work to watch the televised humiliation of the man whose authoritarian regime imprisoned tens of thousands of people without trial will now have to wait until September 14 for the second episode of the drama. In an otherwise crowded courtroom, the high-backed, wooden defendant's seat was conspicuously empty when the presiding judge, Lalu Mariyun, banged his gavel to open the proceedings. Mr Suharto is accused of stealing about \u00a3385m while in power. An hour of legal argument followed as Mr Suharto's team of eight lawyers catalogued the litany of ailments their client's 23 doctors say he is suffering from, and which prevent him from fully understanding the charges against him. They claimed that Mr Suharto, 79, has suffered three strokes in the past two years, and that there was a high risk of further strokes. They also claimed he had dementia, diabetes, loss of memory, impaired speech, brain damage, dangerously high blood pressure and an inability to concentrate, among other illnesses. \"He can only understand and express opinions on simple matters. For complex ones, he needs help, and the quality of his answers cannot be fully guaranteed,\" said Mohammed Assegaf, one of the former general's defence lawyers. Prosecutors immediately demanded a further examination by a team of independent doctors. But the five judges decided that the doctors for the defence should first explain, \"in simple language that can be understood by both us, the judges, and the general public\", the details of Mr Suharto's condition, according to Judge Mariyun. He gave the defence team two weeks to prepare the doctors' testimony, a clear sign that the pretrial wrangling is likely to be extremely protracted and that Mr Suharto, who faces life imprisonment if convicted, is unlikely to appear in court for weeks, if not months. The defence lawyers were outraged that neither the judges nor the prosecution believed the medical reports. \"All doctors are independent,\" said lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon after the hearing. \"How can they doubt our doctors? All doctors have to swear an ethical oath and Mr Suharto's [doctor's] are no different.\" During the past seven months, government doctors continually insisted that Mr Suharto was fit enough to stand trial, while Mr Suharto's doctors countered with the poor-health card. It is unclear whether Mr Suharto can be tried in absentia. Under Indonesian law, the defendant has to attend the first trial session to respond to the charges. However, there are ongoing discussions that, when concluded, may allow the supreme court to pass a decree for the trial to proceed without Mr Suharto. While it is Mr Suharto that is meant to be in the dock, it is not just the former strongman who is on trial in the specially constructed courtroom in an agriculture ministry auditorium next to the Jakarta zoo. The credibility of the Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, his administration, and his commitment to reform are equally under the spotlight. Since coming to power last October, Mr Wahid has been under enormous pressure to prosecute Mr Suharto; students have demonstrated almost daily in Jakarta, demanding a speedy trial and conviction. Hundreds protested in front of the court yesterday, shouting: \"Hang Suharto!\" and \"Don't believe Suharto's lies!\" \"Everyone knows he's guilty of so many crimes, so the government has no excuse for not prosecuting him regardless,\" said Sudianto, a member of the militant City Forum student movement. But the attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, insists that it has not been easy to build a credible case. \"Mr Suharto did not leave any smoking guns lying around,\" he said. \"It has been a long, tough investigation just to get this far.\" That is why Mr Suharto is \"only\" being charged with embezzling about \u00a3385m through seven of the charitable foundations he ran while president, even though he is thought to have siphoned off about \u00a330bn. The 3,000-page prosecution dossier also alleges that Mr Suharto passed several decrees, such as diverting 2% of income tax receipts to the foundations, to enrich himself and his family. There is also no mention in this round of charges of the more widespread corruption, crimes against humanity or abuse of power for which Indonesians want him tried. The end result, according to many observers, particularly as Mr Wahid has promised to pardon Mr Suharto if he is convicted, is that the trial is little more than a charade. \"Gus Dur [Mr Wahid's nickname] is delivering what he thinks the people want, but more importantly, what he needs to give them to survive\" said Teten Marzuki of Indonesia Corruption Watch. \"We're unlikely ever to see either any of Suharto's billions returned to the state or him being prosecuted for more serious crimes.

The exiles, most of whom now live in Mauritius, want to repopulate two islands, Salomons and Peros Banhos, about 140 miles from the base, but the US has made it clear this option should be ruled out.</p> <p>The US stance leaves the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, in a bind. The islanders have turned to the high court in London, demanding the right to return to the islands and a judgment early in October is expected to find in their favour.</p> <p>This would create an awkward stand-off between the islanders and the British and US governments.</p> <p>Mr Cook, though he supported the islanders while he was in opposition, must uphold treaty obligations with the US.</p> <p>The letter, from a senior state department official, Eric Newsom, to Richard Wilkinson, director for the Americas, at the Foreign Office, left Mr Cook with no room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>Mr Newsom, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, said: \"I would like to take this opportunity to express the United States government's serious concern over the inevitable compromise to the current and future strategic value of Diego Garcia that would result from any move to settle a permanent resident population on any of the islands of the Chagos archipelago.\"</p> <p>It added: \"In carrying out our defence and security responsibilities in the Arabian Gulf, the Middle East, south Asia and east Africa, Diego Garcia represents for us an all but indispensable platform. For this reason, in addition to extensive naval requirements, the USG is seeking the permission of your government to develop the island as a forward operating location for expeditionary air force operations - one of only four such locations worldwide.\"</p> <p>Diego Garcia, which is a base for B-52 bombers, was used extensively in the Gulf war in 1991, in further attacks on Iraq in 1998 and for operations elsewhere.</p> <p>Mr Newsom identified the main benefits of Diego Garcia as both its strategic location and its isolation and anticipated further US investment in the base on the island.</p> <p>He added: \"If a resident population were established on the Chagos archipelago, that could well imperil Diego Garcia's present advantage as a base from which it is possible to conduct sensitive military operations that are important for the security of both our governments but that, for reasons of security, cannot be staged from bases near population centres.\"</p> <p>Terrorists could use the islands as a base to launch attacks, he said.</p> <p>He added: \"Settlements on the outer islands would also immediately raise the alarming prospect of the introduction of surveillance, monitoring and electronic jamming devices that have the potential to disrupt, compromise or place at risk vital military operations.\"</p> <p><b>Deceit in Diego Garcia</b><br></p> <p><b> Early 1960s</b> Secret correspondence between British and US governments about clearing the islanders from the Chagos archipelago in the Indian ocean to provide US with base at Diego Garcia.</p> <p><b> 1966</b> Britain leases Diego Garcia to the US until 2016, with an option of extending. It becomes one of America's most important bases</p> <p><b> 1971</b> A British ordinance strips islanders of legal right to return once they are moved</p> <p><b> 1973</b> 2,000 islanders are removed. Britain and the US keep their actions secret from parliament, Congress, the public and, especially, the UN by claiming that the islanders are temporary labourers rather than people who had lived there for generations</p> <p><b> 1979</b> Outcry when British and US tactics emerge during Senate hearings</p> <p><b> 2000</b> The islanders, who were resettled in Mauritius and the Seychelles, take the British government to court claiming the right to return to the Chagos archipelago. Many failed to assimilate in new countries and want to go home. Britain claims they cannot. High court judgment due in early October.</p>",

The confidential letter, sent to the Foreign Office on June 21, adopted an uncompromising position, saying that resettlement of the islands \"would significantly degrade the strategic importance of a vital military asset unique in the region\". The US also disclosed that it intended to expand its Diego Garcia military base, already one of the most strategically important in the world. The Chagos archipelago, a British overseas territory, was cleared of its inhabitants in 1973 to make way for the US base. The exiles, most of whom now live in Mauritius, want to repopulate two islands, Salomons and Peros Banhos, about 140 miles from the base, but the US has made it clear this option should be ruled out. The US stance leaves the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, in a bind. The islanders have turned to the high court in London, demanding the right to return to the islands and a judgment early in October is expected to find in their favour. This would create an awkward stand-off between the islanders and the British and US governments. Mr Cook, though he supported the islanders while he was in opposition, must uphold treaty obligations with the US. The letter, from a senior state department official, Eric Newsom, to Richard Wilkinson, director for the Americas, at the Foreign Office, left Mr Cook with no room for manoeuvre. Mr Newsom, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, said: \"I would like to take this opportunity to express the United States government's serious concern over the inevitable compromise to the current and future strategic value of Diego Garcia that would result from any move to settle a permanent resident population on any of the islands of the Chagos archipelago.\" It added: \"In carrying out our defence and security responsibilities in the Arabian Gulf, the Middle East, south Asia and east Africa, Diego Garcia represents for us an all but indispensable platform. For this reason, in addition to extensive naval requirements, the USG is seeking the permission of your government to develop the island as a forward operating location for expeditionary air force operations - one of only four such locations worldwide.\" Diego Garcia, which is a base for B-52 bombers, was used extensively in the Gulf war in 1991, in further attacks on Iraq in 1998 and for operations elsewhere. Mr Newsom identified the main benefits of Diego Garcia as both its strategic location and its isolation and anticipated further US investment in the base on the island. He added: \"If a resident population were established on the Chagos archipelago, that could well imperil Diego Garcia's present advantage as a base from which it is possible to conduct sensitive military operations that are important for the security of both our governments but that, for reasons of security, cannot be staged from bases near population centres.\" Terrorists could use the islands as a base to launch attacks, he said. He added: \"Settlements on the outer islands would also immediately raise the alarming prospect of the introduction of surveillance, monitoring and electronic jamming devices that have the potential to disrupt, compromise or place at risk vital military operations.\" Deceit in Diego Garcia Early 1960s Secret correspondence between British and US governments about clearing the islanders from the Chagos archipelago in the Indian ocean to provide US with base at Diego Garcia. 1966 Britain leases Diego Garcia to the US until 2016, with an option of extending. It becomes one of America's most important bases 1971 A British ordinance strips islanders of legal right to return once they are moved 1973 2,000 islanders are removed. Britain and the US keep their actions secret from parliament, Congress, the public and, especially, the UN by claiming that the islanders are temporary labourers rather than people who had lived there for generations 1979 Outcry when British and US tactics emerge during Senate hearings 2000 The islanders, who were resettled in Mauritius and the Seychelles, take the British government to court claiming the right to return to the Chagos archipelago. Many failed to assimilate in new countries and want to go home. Britain claims they cannot. High court judgment due in early October.",

Mr Gulen, who has hundreds of thousands of supporters, could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if he is convicted. The indictment against Mr Gulen alleges that he is the \"strongest and most effective Islamic fundamentalist in Turkey\" who \"camouflages his methods with a democratic and moderate image\". Mr Gulen is currently in the United States for lengthy medical treatment, and will probably be tried in absentia. The judicial move against such a prominent figure marks the beginning of a new phase in the Turkish establishment's long battle against what it regards as dangerous religious extremism. The charges were announced just a few hours after the head of the armed forces delivered a stern warning about the threat posed by \"radical Islam\", those Muslims who want to politicise the Islamic faith. Speaking late on Wednesday night, the army chief of staff General Huseyin Kivrikoglu said that thousands of civil servants - some of them in senior positions - are trying to destroy the secular system. \"They are working against the state every day in order to overthrow it,\" he said. \"They have spread everywhere.\" The military has been leading a campaign against a political Islam since 1997, when it helped bring down Turkey's first Islamist-led government.

Body Shots is about being in control and losing control. It combines a Rashomon-style plot of flashbacks where everyone has their version amid the blurred sensibilities of a clubbing night out. Director Michael Cristofer punctuates his plot with its eight main characters' verbally frank, contentious and aggressive opinions on sex. They're an egocentric bunch with 80s yuppie aspirational attitudes and hard to like. Body Shots intends to be serious but can't help feeling exploitative.",

      "body": "<p>How did Baltimore get so lucky? Most mid-sized American regional cities are lucky to have even one film-maker associated with them, if any. Pittsburgh, for example, has Night of the Living Dead director George Romero as its own municipal zombie-wrangler, and Austin has Richard Linklater. But cities like Cleveland, Philadelphia, or Columbus, Ohio? Films get made there once in a blue moon, but not by anyone who's ever lived there or knows them inside-out. </p> <p>Somehow Baltimore has produced not one but two cinematic civic laureates to hymn its faded urban glories: John Waters has made a career out of his distinctively Baltimore-based sensibility, drawing creative (and destructive) succour from its uptight white suburbs, its hillbilly trailer parks and its lively black districts. </p> <p>Then there's Barry Levinson, better known for huge hits like Rain Man and Good Morning, Vietnam, and for studio star vehicles like Disclosure and Sphere. But to those who have followed his career since his directorial debut Diner in 1982, he's the quintessential Baltimore filmmaker. Between his big studio hits - and sometimes directly because of them - he has made three further movies based on his rich reservoir of memories of his hometown. </p> <p>Tin Men, from 1988, was a manic comedy set in 1963 about competition, war, sexual jealousy and salesmanship among men about 15 years older than the adolescents in Diner. Avalon, made as a reward after the worldwide success of Rain Man, is a symphonic, rhythmical family drama that adheres to John Gregory Dunne's narrative prescription for the 20th-century American immigrant experience - \"from steerage to suburbia in three generations\" - and details the impact of television on its extended Jewish family. It feels like a languorous, contented version of Terence Davies' Distant Voices, Still Lives. Now, 10 years later, Levinson has again returned to Baltimore with Liberty Heights. </p> <p>\"I never thought of them as a quartet till now,\" says Levinson over an outdoor breakfast at a starchy Beverly Hills hotel. \"And it really wasn't planned that way. I always thought I was lucky just to get one made. But periodically you go back and it gives you a chance to re-evaluate, make sense out of things in your life, things going on in the country, and in the specific place in which you grew up. For me that's an interesting dynamic.\" </p> <p>Liberty Heights expands on the issues of being both Jewish and American that were hinted at in Avalon. It's a loving, complex portrait of a time and a place, enriched by detailed personal experience and peppered both with tragedy and Levinson's warm and absurd sense of humour.</p> <p>It most closely resembles Diner - indeed the high school kids in it will grow up to be the diner guys - but also shows how much Levinson's writing has matured in the last 20 years. Diner was about the indistinct borderlands between adolescence and adulthood and between freedom and responsibility. Liberty Heights, named for a Jewish district of the city, is about many lines, most of them very sharply delineated: between Jews and goyim in general, between Jews and blacks and rich WASPs in particular, between criminality and the law, and between immigrant parents and their assimilated children.</p> <p>It's appropriate that all these dividing lines should run through Baltimore; after all, the Mason-Dixon line bisects Maryland across the middle, and the state, half Union, half Confederate during the civil war, remains an intriguing hybrid of northern seaport and sleepy, humid southern industrial city with a black majority population. </p> <p>Like the other Baltimore movies, Liberty Heights takes place at a specific cultural and political moment, in this case between the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court decision that desegregated America's state schools in mid-1954, and the rise of rock'n'roll in the next 12 months, aided by a similar, more gradual desegregation of the white-dominated airwaves. </p> <p>Diner is set in the last week of the 1950s, as the stormclouds gather. Tin Men takes place in the summer before the Kennedy assassination, but never mentions it. What symbolises change at the movie's end is the heartbreaking news that this year's Cadillac will be the last one with fins. (The 1955 Cadillac Coupe de Ville is a totemic fetish-object for Levinson - Tin Men's credits are written in Cadillac chrome lettering as the camera caresses the car's smooth curves and creamy paintwork, and in Liberty Heights Mantegna sneaks out of the Rosh Hashanah service to go view \"the new Caddies\".) Avalon, in Levinson's eyes, is less about the immigrant experience than it is about the TV as destructive symbol of American values. </p> <p>Television looms large in Levinson's life, what with his dad being a TV salesman, and his own decision after graduating high school in 1960 to study broadcast journalism whilst working in a local TV station. He worked in England as a writer for The Marty Feldman Show. \"I lived all over for short periods of time,\" he recalls, as he tries to reel forgotten phrases like \"High Barnet\" and \"St Albans\" up out of a 35-year-deep hole of memories. \"I was so fascinated by the day-to-day goings-on in these odd little places that I didn't want to just stay in London.\" </p> <p>He arrived in Los Angeles in 1967. \"LA was much more laid back then than it is now, even if the 1960s did feel like some huge national costume party.\" He wrote comedy for Alan King and Tim Conway before netting a job on The Carol Burnett Show. This earned him what he laughingly calls \"respectability in the business\", and in the early 70s he began what he calls \"a great apprenticeship in the movies\" with comedian Mel Brooks. He was one of the writers on Brooks's Silent Movie and his Hitchcock spoof High Anxiety, in which he also played the maniacal bellboy in the shower scene (\"Here's your NEWS-PAPER!!\"). </p> <p>\"We met every day for three years for breakfast and we'd write all day, over lunch and into the evening.\" Brooks had been a pioneer member of the legendary TV writing team for Your Show of Shows Starring Sid Caesar (a 15-year-old Woody Allen got his start there in 1951 as a gag-man) and Levinson remembers, \"we were sort of the next generation, I suppose, so I heard all their great stories about those days.\" </p> <p>By the beginning of the 80s, Levinson had found his style and was working up his own material, much of it autobiographical and written with his then-wife, Valerie Curtin. He did uncredited rewrites on Tootsie (later he enriched 48 Hrs by adding the famous scene in which Eddie Murphy tells a barful of rednecks \"I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare - a nigger with a badge!\"), and sold Best Friends, based on his relationship with Curtin, which was made starring Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn, and the legal black comedy ...And Justice For All. </p> <p>\"Best Friends became a much more Hollywood kind of movie as it got made,\" says Levinson but ...And Justice For All (which he co-wrote with Curtin) is all about Baltimore. It was made up of stories I'd heard from friends of mine at the diner who'd grown up to be lawyers - stories of the insanity of the system and how fucked up it was on so many different levels. If it had happened later it could easily have become one of my Baltimore movies.\" </p> <p>Instead that first Baltimore movie ended up being Diner which, despite a brainless Variety review that called it \"dark, depressing and inaccessible\" was a huge hit and an indisputable classic, one of the best coming-of-age comedies ever made. With the other three films - and to a lesser extent with associated projects like ...And Justice, the TV series Homicide (made by Levinson's influential production company Baltimore Pictures) and his unreleased documentary Diner Guys, about his old Baltimore friends - Levinson has created a gigantic tapestry of lower-middle class life in the middle of the American century.</p> <p>A thread from one will turn up in another, like the Fells Point Diner itself, which appears in all four, or the 1950 Hornet that Van drives in Liberty Heights, which Mickey Rourke seems to own by 1959 in Diner.

      "body": "<p>I lived in Medellin from May to December 1999, while we prepared and filmed Our Lady of the Assassins, based on the book by Fernando Vallejo. It is the story of a man who returns to the Colombian city after several years to find it has been taken over by young contract killers, or sicarios, hired by the drug traffickers. </p> <p>Medellin is the city of eternal spring, the city where the kindness and courtesy of another time - that of my childhood in Colombia - lives on to this day. It's also a city obsessed with order and cleanliness, a city full of energy and happiness. There is of course another facet to it which can be summed up in figures: 5,000 documented armed gangs; 95% of crimes go unpunished; 15 deaths per day, 30 on weekends and holidays. </p> <p>Everything is played out in the poor neighbourhoods, or communes. The police only enter in case of dire necessity, and then in droves. The paramilitary and the guerrillas dispute areas of influence by creating or taking control of certain gangs. </p> <p>I've collected here in chronological order some emails - quick snapshots - I sent once or twice a week to Vallejo and some friends during this time. </p> <p> <strong> Hold-up</strong> </p> <p> Our very first scouting. I'm filming the house where Vallejo was born with a small digital camera when I hear yells behind me. It's my Colombian friend Eduardo, screaming out a slew of insults: \"Motherfucker! Gonorrhea!\" etc. He runs and stops in the middle of the street pretending to load his cellular phone as if it were a black gun.</p> <p>A young, well-dressed man has just walked up to Eduardo and tried to grab his mobile phone out of his back pocket. Eduardo has ripped the phone out of his assailant's hands and is now pretending it is a gun.</p> <p>The young man takes a few steps toward me, puts his right arm behind his back. He wants the camera. Holding the camera with my arms outstretched, I tell him to come and get it. He thinks it over, turns around and leaves. The thing is, I didn't see the young man's gun - a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. He must have thought he was dealing with two dangerous lunatics, and that it was too risky. </p> <p>But he didn't depart empty-handed - he'd still had enough time to steal our driver's gold chain while threatening her with the gun and telling her \"todo bien\" - that everything was going to be all right. </p> <p> <strong> The mayor</strong> </p> <p>Today I met the mayor of Medellin. He's very worried about a new armed gang made up of FARC dissidents operating in the Pilarica neighbourhood and headed by a female doctor who is apparently out of control and very bloodthirsty. Four policemen were seriously wounded last night by her gang. </p> <p>While we were in his office, he found out that one policeman had died. A little later another phonecall: a commando unit of 17 members of the Las Terrazas gang has burst into the San Jose hospital to free a terrorist and a very dangerous assassin who had been injured and brought there from the high-security prison. Last Sunday, on Father's Day, there were 34 deaths. </p> <p>The casting's going very well - in just a few weeks we have already found two possible boys. These 15-year-old criminals' vitality and angelic good looks, the very studied elegance of their clothes and their way of considering their short lives like those of butterflies, are irresistible. The survivors - the ones that talk like retirees - are 21 years old. </p> <p> <strong> Another corpse</strong> </p> <p>Last night I saw one before dinner; today before lunch. At noon I was walking, as I do every day, with my friend Eduardo to eat five minutes from here. At a red light Eduardo recognised the driver and van that picks up bodies. Sure enough, not too far away, there was a very young man on the ground surrounded by curious onlookers and policemen. </p> <p>When I get back, less than half an hour later, I again think it was all a dream: no trace of blood and children are playing right where the body had been. </p> <p> <strong> Manrique</strong> </p> <p>Two scenes in the movie take place in Manrique, a neighbourhood that, because of the Las Terrazas gang, has become one of the city's most dangerous. A friend of mine, Papa Giovanni, has organised protection for us so we can scout the neighbourhood but I immediately realise that even he is ill at ease.</p> <p>He introduces us to a 22-year-old gang boss, a survivor, slightly fat, crew cut, blue, unblinking eyes. He's got a strategy to never, ever look anyone in the eye. Very, very calm, his gestures measured. You get the chilling feeling that he is staring at piles of corpses behind the person he is speaking to. He never smiles.</p> <p>Even Eduardo, who's very funny and used to this kind of character, can't make him laugh. There's another guy who laughs nervously all the time - the gang leader's sicario. In veiled terms, always laughing, he brags about being bad, something about a chainsaw. We wish we'd never met them, and want them to forget they ever knew us. </p> <p>We go all over the neighbourhood. I discover another side to the gangster's personality: he tries to pick up all the girls by giving them orders: \"You, come over here!\" Sometimes the killer joins in. The girls, even very young ones, already know it's very dangerous to react in the slightest way, and keep walking. We won't set foot in Manrique again and we won't ever ask Papa Giovanni to show us around another neighbourhood that isn't his. </p> <p> <strong> Anderson</strong> </p> <p>That's it, I finally met Anderson [the actor who will play Alexis]. I'd seen a video of him and sent everyone looking for him through the city for the last 15 days. He is absolutely extraordinary. Ambiguous, angel and devil, very charismatic - a 16-year-old, streetwise, Montgomery Clift type. His acting needs some work but he's bright and the camera loves him. He lives with his 13-year-old brother in a commune very high up in the hills controlled by the militia tied to the guerrillas. </p> <p>We try to put him up in town but he doesn't want to move because his mother, who's in prison, calls him at a phone up there. He sells incense on the street and has just finished a three-month jail sentence for burglary. Last night, with three friends, he assaulted a passerby, they split the equivalent of $50. A little later the police stopped them after they'd already spent the money and made them give their victim their shoes. He had to go home barefoot: a two-hour climb. Tomorrow I'm taking him to see a doctor and we'll look for an apartment for him near his little brother's school. </p> <p><strong> The Frenchman flees in panic</strong> </p> <p>A hard blow today. It certainly won't be the last and I can't help but laugh about it. My production manager, who had left for Paris for a few days, has just pulled out; he doesn't want to come back as planned, he was too scared here and didn't dare tell me. He gave me the key to his locker when he left. I've just opened it. It was practically empty, so his treason was premeditated! From now on, I will be the only foreigner on the crew. </p> <p> <strong> Todo bien</strong> </p> <p>Two serious problems the day before yesterday. We lost the most important, irreplaceable location - the apartment the film takes place in - and two bikers caught up to our driver and threw a crumpled paper ball into the car, a note that read: \"LOS PP'S QUEREMOS AL MONO TODO BIEN\" (the PPs want the foreigner, everything's all right). </p> <p>In Colombia receiving a note like this is often a death sentence. Now the paranoid atmosphere we are working in is assured. On the bright side, we think it's from a gang who are into extortion and not kidnapping. The dark side: it's only the beginning, something else could follow, like someone firing shots at the car or the house. </p> <p>Today we had a meeting with one of the country's top \"security analysts\" who suspects our chauffeur. We are waiting for the results of the graphology [writing samples] tests. Anyway, without telling the security specialist (you really can't trust anyone), we have established discreet contact with the police chief.</p> <p>Starting tomorrow, he is lending us two cops dressed as civilians, armed to the teeth, who will follow me in their car as soon as I leave my new home, which will be a true fortress. Officially I will keep living at the same address. I will never travel twice in a row in the same car, my drivers will also be security guards. On location, starting tomorrow, there will always be an armoured car ready to take me away! </p> <p>The actors' reading went fabulously well. The script is perfect and so are the actors. I am a happy man for the moment; now we just have to make the movie come to life. </p> <p> <strong> Bodyguards</strong> </p> <p>I don't enjoy my new life with bodyguards but I maintain my perspective on things; it seems I'm a \"level-seven risk\" (on a scale of 10). In any case it certainly impresses my young actor Anderson, who spends his days and part of his nights with me. </p> <p>My bodyguards are two young policemen, no more than 24 years old. I am in permanent radio contact with them by means of a little black object which is a combination cellular phone, beeper and radio. If someone suspicious approaches and speaks to me I only have to press a little button and the whole security corps listens in on our conversation. They both carry guns, mini-Uzis and sawn-off hunting rifles. </p> <p>The first, Raul, is short, dark-skinned and fat, and the other, Leonardo, is skinny, blond and good-looking. Leonardo has decided to become my friend and he's very forward. The day before yesterday he asked me if I like Antioquian food. I said yes. He then asked me if I wanted to have lunch at his place the following day. He insists I go alone which has made me experience a horrible inner conflict and led me to think about it in four differing ways: </p> <p>1. It's a trap - every kidnapping story involves a cop. </p> <p>2. I have to go - it's the least I can do for someone I make follow my rhythm of no more than six hours' sleep per day. </p> <p>3. I have no reason to feel obligated - he's the one who's exaggerating by putting me in this situation. </p> <p>4. I'm naturally curious. </p> <p>Number four eventually won out. A family atmosphere with a dash of paramilitarism. At least five statues of the Virgin. I now know all the technical details about the manufacture of home-made guerrilla bombs. </p> <p> <strong> Young actors </strong> </p> <p>Anderson hadn't told us about his recent problems with the law: he's wanted for kidnapping and armed assault! We try to soften up the judge. In one case, they'd taken a cab driver hostage but the taxi had an alarm system that paralysed the vehicle after 15 minutes. Anderson and his friends found themselves in the open countryside in the middle of the night with a mob of taxi drivers who were about to lynch them; they were saved by the police, who then filed charges against them. </p> <p>Juan David, who plays the character Wilmar, is also in trouble. He lives in the Bello commune and he's on a list, made by a group interested in \"social cleansing\", of people to be executed. He should move today to an apartment we found him right next to ours. The day before yesterday, a rainy night, none of the members of his gang were on guard, watching out for the neighbouring enemy gang who took advantage of the situation and sneaked into his best friend's house and killed him. Since his mother stood up to them, they killed her too. </p> <p>Last night Juan David was faced with the following dilemma: avenge his best friend's mother's murder or refuse to take part in the retaliatory expedition and thus put his own life in danger. I tried to explain to him that the mother's death wasn't the worst thing that could have happened and that in fact she had averted years of terrible misery. He seemed convinced when he left. </p> <p>When he got back for the make-up test this morning I found out his best friend's mother's murderer had been killed last night. </p> <p> <strong> Execution</strong> </p> <p>Papa Giovanni helps us enter the Diamante commune. Yesterday, just after we parted company, he was having a beer with his friend Olman, who was going to play a part in the film. A man slowly passed behind Olman and shot him in the head. He left just as slowly. The bullet, which could also have wounded Giovanni, didn't exit but it created a lump on Olman's forehead before he dropped dead on to the table. </p> <p>Giovanni is deeply grief-stricken; he can't get over it. </p> <p><strong> Disposables </strong> </p> <p>An incredible scene last night in the church of San Antonio; we had 50 basuqueros come in, the local equivalent - but much worse - of crackheads. Some people here call them desechables or disposables, individuals you can throw away or kill. They're wild-eyed and uncontrollable, talking and playing non-stop like small children. They sort of took over and we adjusted. </p> <p>Before the shoot, the wardrobe manager was taking pictures for continuity. One of the basuqueros appointed himself as their spokesman to tell me that they were scared, that they thought we were drawing up lists to have them killed. </p> <p><strong> Anderson's dark past</strong> </p> <p> Every day we find out something else about Anderson and it isn't him who tells us. There are people who have \"debts to settle\" (culebras) with him, in particular a serious affair with coke dealers from Manrique. They are suspected of having wanted to kill Anderson last night when they shot three of his best friends at the spot under the subway where he meets them every night - one dead and two injured. Luckily he wasn't there, we were shooting that night. Before he started spending time with us he kept very nasty company. </p> <p>There are also some policemen who know him very well and are just waiting to run into him alone at night to get rid of him. This is what they told Eduardo last week when they arrested Anderson in the street, handcuffed him and started beating him near Bolivar park. It happened around lunchtime, during the filming. Luckily Eduardo was able to radio the bodyguards and put an end to the incident. </p> <p><strong> Real weapons, better acting</strong> </p> <p>After using very well-made copies, I found out that using real guns put my young actors into a trance. Their eyes shine, they're much more concentrated and play their role much more seriously. This of course complicates the security issue but in some cases it's worth it. I sometimes even go so far as to let them carry guns though they're not used in the scene. </p> <p><strong> Accountant assaulted</strong> </p> <p>Yesterday our accountant was assaulted on his return from the bank with an envelope full of cash. Two gun-slinging youngsters on a motorbike followed him from the bank and asked him to hand over the envelope. The accountant hesitated until they asked him if he wanted to die. It lasted all of two seconds in front of a dozen witnesses. They would've shot him without any hesitation - it's one of their rules of conduct to maintain the level of danger and terror. </p> <p><strong> Gunshots on La Playa</strong> </p> <p>Looking for peace and quiet, we film violent street scenes as a rule very early on Sunday mornings. I always try to avoid firing blanks in scenes so we don't traumatise the population who already hear enough gunshots every day. </p> <p>Sometimes, though, it's impossible to get good reactions from the extras without firing blanks. Such is the case for three shots that day. Soon after the first gunshots are fired, I see several people all dressed in white walking down La Playa Avenue where we're filming. I immediately know they're not extras. I've banned two colours in the film: white for technical videotaping reasons, and orange for aesthetic ones. We finally figure out who they are: they're peace marchers.Today, for the first time, in every city in the country, crowds of millions of people in white are demonstrating that they're sick and tired of violence. A memorable date. </p> <p>When I was a child here it was also a matter of colours: the \"blues\" and the \"reds\" were killing each other by the thousands. We had to twist my parrot's neck since it kept repeating: \"I'm dressed in green but I'm a liberal\" (red). We couldn't give him away or let him loose: he might have caused a massacre in any house he landed in. </p> <p><strong> A new strategy</strong> </p> <p>I found out last night from a police source that the guerrillas have just put out a call for hostages in the criminal underground - they'll pay $1,000 cash for any foreigner. My bodyguards are very nervous. </p> <p>The guerrillas are among us, in the city, and they're given a monthly salary. They steal vehicles, put on uniforms at the last minute, raise blockades, capture the hostages that interest them after having stripped the others of any valuables. One thing is certain: taking into account the fact that, on every front, things are getting inexorably worse, this film could not have been made here a year from now. Unless there were a miracle, and peace took hold overnight. Nobody believes that will happen. Anyone who can is thinking of settling abroad. </p> <p><strong> The fake Aiwa</strong> </p> <p>We needed props, copies we could damage, an Aiwa sound-system to throw out the window. It turns out it's three times cheaper to buy a real Aiwa sound-system than to have a fake one made. Money laundering. A contraband Mont Blanc pen costs $90 on the black market. The factory, the Mont Blanc headquarters, sold the same pen for $120. Money laundering. Another money-laundering scheme. </p> <p><strong> A formula for filming downtown</strong> </p> <p>First, organise a fake set with cameras, projectors and a hysterical director. Comedy mixed with violence is a true crowd-pleaser. Then, very discreetly, film the real thing 50m away. </p> <p>Second, coach a dozen extras to approach people who might notice what you're doing during the takes. Have the extras ask them for the time or tell them to move along. The hapless souls who refuse to move are immediately assaulted by our special task force: a group of frightening, stinking beggars who stick to them like glue and hound them for money until they leave. </p> <p>This system works wonders. </p> <p><strong> Last day of shooting</strong> </p> <p>We were supposed to start at 10am on a set built in a warehouse. The entrance hall of the morgue. Nothing was ready: a door and some fluorescent lights are missing. We wait around all day, and finally, at 6pm, the door arrives. It's too big. We end up filming at 9pm with no fluorescent lights, only the regular film lights, a single very complex shot. We luckily never ran across these kinds of problems during the rest of the shoot. We just had to end it all on a slightly Colombian note. Overall, the crew I had the chance to work with were well up to international standards. </p> <p>Emotions ran high when the champagne began to flow. Things that had been left unsaid during the shoot came out into the open. Everyone thought I was crazy to have tried to make this film. Now they would have to return to the hard reality of a country on the brink of disaster without ever being able to forget these past seven weeks. Neither will I. I don't think I will ever again take part in such an emotionally charged and dramatic shoot. </p> <p>Driving home at 2am on the deserted highway I hear three gunshots at the back of the vehicle: one of my giddy bodyguards is firing into the air. Later he will try to justify this by saying that a large car with six shady guys approached us at high speed and that he chased them away by firing. Eduardo is certain he didn't see a car. We'll never know. A typically Colombian experience: to become less and less sure how real what you see and hear is. </p> <p>\u0095 Barbet Schroeder's Our Lady of the Assassins receives its world premiere at the Venice film festival next Wednesday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I lived in Medellin from May to December 1999, while we prepared and filmed Our Lady of the Assassins, based on the book by Fernando Vallejo. It is the story of a man who returns to the Colombian city after several years to find it has been taken over by young contract killers, or sicarios, hired by the drug traffickers. Medellin is the city of eternal spring, the city where the kindness and courtesy of another time - that of my childhood in Colombia - lives on to this day. It's also a city obsessed with order and cleanliness, a city full of energy and happiness. There is of course another facet to it which can be summed up in figures: 5,000 documented armed gangs; 95% of crimes go unpunished; 15 deaths per day, 30 on weekends and holidays. Everything is played out in the poor neighbourhoods, or communes. The police only enter in case of dire necessity, and then in droves. The paramilitary and the guerrillas dispute areas of influence by creating or taking control of certain gangs. I've collected here in chronological order some emails - quick snapshots - I sent once or twice a week to Vallejo and some friends during this time. Hold-up Our very first scouting. I'm filming the house where Vallejo was born with a small digital camera when I hear yells behind me. It's my Colombian friend Eduardo, screaming out a slew of insults: \"Motherfucker! Gonorrhea!\" etc. He runs and stops in the middle of the street pretending to load his cellular phone as if it were a black gun. A young, well-dressed man has just walked up to Eduardo and tried to grab his mobile phone out of his back pocket. Eduardo has ripped the phone out of his assailant's hands and is now pretending it is a gun. The young man takes a few steps toward me, puts his right arm behind his back. He wants the camera. Holding the camera with my arms outstretched, I tell him to come and get it. He thinks it over, turns around and leaves. The thing is, I didn't see the young man's gun - a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. He must have thought he was dealing with two dangerous lunatics, and that it was too risky. But he didn't depart empty-handed - he'd still had enough time to steal our driver's gold chain while threatening her with the gun and telling her \"todo bien\" - that everything was going to be all right. The mayor Today I met the mayor of Medellin. He's very worried about a new armed gang made up of FARC dissidents operating in the Pilarica neighbourhood and headed by a female doctor who is apparently out of control and very bloodthirsty. Four policemen were seriously wounded last night by her gang. While we were in his office, he found out that one policeman had died. A little later another phonecall: a commando unit of 17 members of the Las Terrazas gang has burst into the San Jose hospital to free a terrorist and a very dangerous assassin who had been injured and brought there from the high-security prison. Last Sunday, on Father's Day, there were 34 deaths. The casting's going very well - in just a few weeks we have already found two possible boys. These 15-year-old criminals' vitality and angelic good looks, the very studied elegance of their clothes and their way of considering their short lives like those of butterflies, are irresistible. The survivors - the ones that talk like retirees - are 21 years old. Another corpse Last night I saw one before dinner; today before lunch. At noon I was walking, as I do every day, with my friend Eduardo to eat five minutes from here. At a red light Eduardo recognised the driver and van that picks up bodies. Sure enough, not too far away, there was a very young man on the ground surrounded by curious onlookers and policemen. When I get back, less than half an hour later, I again think it was all a dream: no trace of blood and children are playing right where the body had been. Manrique Two scenes in the movie take place in Manrique, a neighbourhood that, because of the Las Terrazas gang, has become one of the city's most dangerous. A friend of mine, Papa Giovanni, has organised protection for us so we can scout the neighbourhood but I immediately realise that even he is ill at ease. He introduces us to a 22-year-old gang boss, a survivor, slightly fat, crew cut, blue, unblinking eyes. He's got a strategy to never, ever look anyone in the eye. Very, very calm, his gestures measured. You get the chilling feeling that he is staring at piles of corpses behind the person he is speaking to. He never smiles. Even Eduardo, who's very funny and used to this kind of character, can't make him laugh. There's another guy who laughs nervously all the time - the gang leader's sicario. In veiled terms, always laughing, he brags about being bad, something about a chainsaw. We wish we'd never met them, and want them to forget they ever knew us. We go all over the neighbourhood. I discover another side to the gangster's personality: he tries to pick up all the girls by giving them orders: \"You, come over here!\" Sometimes the killer joins in. The girls, even very young ones, already know it's very dangerous to react in the slightest way, and keep walking. We won't set foot in Manrique again and we won't ever ask Papa Giovanni to show us around another neighbourhood that isn't his. Anderson That's it, I finally met Anderson [the actor who will play Alexis]. I'd seen a video of him and sent everyone looking for him through the city for the last 15 days. He is absolutely extraordinary. Ambiguous, angel and devil, very charismatic - a 16-year-old, streetwise, Montgomery Clift type. His acting needs some work but he's bright and the camera loves him. He lives with his 13-year-old brother in a commune very high up in the hills controlled by the militia tied to the guerrillas. We try to put him up in town but he doesn't want to move because his mother, who's in prison, calls him at a phone up there. He sells incense on the street and has just finished a three-month jail sentence for burglary. Last night, with three friends, he assaulted a passerby, they split the equivalent of $50. A little later the police stopped them after they'd already spent the money and made them give their victim their shoes. He had to go home barefoot: a two-hour climb. Tomorrow I'm taking him to see a doctor and we'll look for an apartment for him near his little brother's school. The Frenchman flees in panic A hard blow today. It certainly won't be the last and I can't help but laugh about it. My production manager, who had left for Paris for a few days, has just pulled out; he doesn't want to come back as planned, he was too scared here and didn't dare tell me. He gave me the key to his locker when he left. I've just opened it. It was practically empty, so his treason was premeditated! From now on, I will be the only foreigner on the crew. Todo bien Two serious problems the day before yesterday. We lost the most important, irreplaceable location - the apartment the film takes place in - and two bikers caught up to our driver and threw a crumpled paper ball into the car, a note that read: \"LOS PP'S QUEREMOS AL MONO TODO BIEN\" (the PPs want the foreigner, everything's all right). In Colombia receiving a note like this is often a death sentence. Now the paranoid atmosphere we are working in is assured. On the bright side, we think it's from a gang who are into extortion and not kidnapping. The dark side: it's only the beginning, something else could follow, like someone firing shots at the car or the house. Today we had a meeting with one of the country's top \"security analysts\" who suspects our chauffeur. We are waiting for the results of the graphology [writing samples] tests. Anyway, without telling the security specialist (you really can't trust anyone), we have established discreet contact with the police chief. Starting tomorrow, he is lending us two cops dressed as civilians, armed to the teeth, who will follow me in their car as soon as I leave my new home, which will be a true fortress. Officially I will keep living at the same address. I will never travel twice in a row in the same car, my drivers will also be security guards. On location, starting tomorrow, there will always be an armoured car ready to take me away! The actors' reading went fabulously well. The script is perfect and so are the actors. I am a happy man for the moment; now we just have to make the movie come to life. Bodyguards I don't enjoy my new life with bodyguards but I maintain my perspective on things; it seems I'm a \"level-seven risk\" (on a scale of 10). In any case it certainly impresses my young actor Anderson, who spends his days and part of his nights with me. My bodyguards are two young policemen, no more than 24 years old. I am in permanent radio contact with them by means of a little black object which is a combination cellular phone, beeper and radio. If someone suspicious approaches and speaks to me I only have to press a little button and the whole security corps listens in on our conversation. They both carry guns, mini-Uzis and sawn-off hunting rifles. The first, Raul, is short, dark-skinned and fat, and the other, Leonardo, is skinny, blond and good-looking. Leonardo has decided to become my friend and he's very forward. The day before yesterday he asked me if I like Antioquian food. I said yes. He then asked me if I wanted to have lunch at his place the following day. He insists I go alone which has made me experience a horrible inner conflict and led me to think about it in four differing ways: 1. It's a trap - every kidnapping story involves a cop. 2. I have to go - it's the least I can do for someone I make follow my rhythm of no more than six hours' sleep per day. 3. I have no reason to feel obligated - he's the one who's exaggerating by putting me in this situation. 4. I'm naturally curious. Number four eventually won out. A family atmosphere with a dash of paramilitarism. At least five statues of the Virgin. I now know all the technical details about the manufacture of home-made guerrilla bombs. Young actors Anderson hadn't told us about his recent problems with the law: he's wanted for kidnapping and armed assault! We try to soften up the judge. In one case, they'd taken a cab driver hostage but the taxi had an alarm system that paralysed the vehicle after 15 minutes. Anderson and his friends found themselves in the open countryside in the middle of the night with a mob of taxi drivers who were about to lynch them; they were saved by the police, who then filed charges against them. Juan David, who plays the character Wilmar, is also in trouble. He lives in the Bello commune and he's on a list, made by a group interested in \"social cleansing\", of people to be executed. He should move today to an apartment we found him right next to ours. The day before yesterday, a rainy night, none of the members of his gang were on guard, watching out for the neighbouring enemy gang who took advantage of the situation and sneaked into his best friend's house and killed him. Since his mother stood up to them, they killed her too. Last night Juan David was faced with the following dilemma: avenge his best friend's mother's murder or refuse to take part in the retaliatory expedition and thus put his own life in danger. I tried to explain to him that the mother's death wasn't the worst thing that could have happened and that in fact she had averted years of terrible misery. He seemed convinced when he left. When he got back for the make-up test this morning I found out his best friend's mother's murderer had been killed last night. Execution Papa Giovanni helps us enter the Diamante commune. Yesterday, just after we parted company, he was having a beer with his friend Olman, who was going to play a part in the film. A man slowly passed behind Olman and shot him in the head. He left just as slowly. The bullet, which could also have wounded Giovanni, didn't exit but it created a lump on Olman's forehead before he dropped dead on to the table. Giovanni is deeply grief-stricken; he can't get over it. Disposables An incredible scene last night in the church of San Antonio; we had 50 basuqueros come in, the local equivalent - but much worse - of crackheads. Some people here call them desechables or disposables, individuals you can throw away or kill. They're wild-eyed and uncontrollable, talking and playing non-stop like small children. They sort of took over and we adjusted. Before the shoot, the wardrobe manager was taking pictures for continuity. One of the basuqueros appointed himself as their spokesman to tell me that they were scared, that they thought we were drawing up lists to have them killed. Anderson's dark past Every day we find out something else about Anderson and it isn't him who tells us. There are people who have \"debts to settle\" (culebras) with him, in particular a serious affair with coke dealers from Manrique. They are suspected of having wanted to kill Anderson last night when they shot three of his best friends at the spot under the subway where he meets them every night - one dead and two injured. Luckily he wasn't there, we were shooting that night. Before he started spending time with us he kept very nasty company.

Their eyes shine, they're much more concentrated and play their role much more seriously. This of course complicates the security issue but in some cases it's worth it. I sometimes even go so far as to let them carry guns though they're not used in the scene. Accountant assaulted Yesterday our accountant was assaulted on his return from the bank with an envelope full of cash. Two gun-slinging youngsters on a motorbike followed him from the bank and asked him to hand over the envelope. The accountant hesitated until they asked him if he wanted to die. It lasted all of two seconds in front of a dozen witnesses. They would've shot him without any hesitation - it's one of their rules of conduct to maintain the level of danger and terror. Gunshots on La Playa Looking for peace and quiet, we film violent street scenes as a rule very early on Sunday mornings.

      "body": "<p>If the legacy of Euan Uglow, who has died aged 68, were imagined as a string of gems, the rarest would be his beautifully faceted paintings of silent nudes. Equally distinctive are those of solitary fruit or fragile flowers. Although greatly desired by individuals, they were undervalued by exhibition- and collection-making professionals, and are under-represented in museums. </p> <p>Uglow was \"one of Britain's 15 most significant artists\" for Lord Snowdon's group portraits in Vogue on the occasion of the Tate Modern opening. Misleadingly described as a figurative or realist painter, his contribution was actually as radical and experimental as any celebrated postwar artist. The ideas he pursued had nothing to do with language or the camera. Rather, his aim was \"a structured painting full of controlled, and therefore potent, emotion\". </p> <p>Uglow's life centred on south London. After he moved to Turnchapel Mews, Battersea, in 1958 and adapted its upper floor to achieve the high grey London light favoured for its constancy, it was difficult for him to function anywhere else. His family house was in Norwood: his father was an accountant, and his mother expected her talented son never to let her down. </p> <p>During the war he and his brother John were evacuated to a farm in Cornwall, where a childhood keenness for making things that function flourished as he watched a wheelwright and a two-man abattoir. He then spent the period 1954-56 on a farm and in building work as a conscientious objector. Indeed, his way of being creative through constructing things and observing organic growth and decay made his art continuous with his recreations. </p> <p>Uglow's enrolment in the junior class at Camberwell school of art in 1948 brought him into contact with the new professor, William Coldstream, who moved on to the Slade school of art the next year; Uglow himself began studying there in 1951. A number of talented students and young instructors reinforced a bias towards art that respected appearances and the formal nature of a picture as a flat rectangle. Unadorned subjects were set within highly artificial studio set-ups, the combinations of colour and form increasingly original. Pumpkin slices against blue and rose ochre were inspired by, for example, Lorenzetti's graceful, prowed boats. One of Uglow's favourite works, Rembrandt's Bathsheba, was admired for the impossibility of the pose and the way the navel \"makes the whole stomach\". </p> <p>Some of Uglow's earliest paintings experiment with systems of representation. The arcadian scene, The Musicians (1953), is about perspective, while Nude, From Twelve Regular Vertical Positions From the Eye (1967) eliminates it. This formidable picture won the prestigious John Moores painting prize in 1972. </p> <p>In his 20s, Uglow began a habit of travelling to see art, especially by artists of the early Italian Renaissance such as Masaccio and Piero della Francesca. These pilgrimages, the first by motorcycle and the last to see Grunewald's Crucifixion in Colmar, were occasions to enter the mind of the creator though the specific context of a place. Uglow accomplished such osmosis with painters to grow closer to the mind of the creator. However, as he said, he saw Poussin's composition on London streets - witness the 1988 picture of a girl chased by a man - and felt the tension of C\u00e9zanne in his own relationship to still-life. He found common ground in situations quite foreign - like admiring the self-discipline of artists he observed over a few weeks in a Chinese art school in 1987. </p> <p>According to Uglow, no one could be too much of a perfectionist. He even made his own frames in order to achieve the right tone and extend the proportions, so that landscapes had deeper sides than top and bottom. Taking this perfectionism to heart, he practised a puritanical devotion to working in the studio and a scepticism about career self-promotion. Most of the shows were presented by his loyal dealer William Darby in the confined space of a Cork Street gallery, and one at Salander-O'Reilly in New York in 1993. </p> <p>The first showing began a national tour at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1974. Highlights were the composite, torqued figure lying under the suspended heater in Three In One (1968) and a curled seated nude set against glowing blue in Summer Picture (1972). </p> <p>By the next Whitechapel show in 1989, there were 32 nudes, including the Tate's standing Zagi (1983) and one study of a church in Cyprus. Both human and vegetable forms could be at once iconic and private - the inspiration sometimes revealed in their titles - diagonal, wave, propeller, pyramid and cuddle. As art critic David Sylvester remarked, reviewing Uglow's sensational show at Browse &amp; Darby in 1997, where the small night studies were equally significant, the pictures are taut to the point of hurting the spectator and the harmonies and solutions to perceived perspective compare to the challenge Bach invented for himself in making fugues. </p> <p>Some of the inventiveness and strain of pulling off paintings in progress for several years with living subjects was shared in London Weekend Television's South Bank Show documentary that traced the creation of Root Five Nude (1976). At the time, many art historians, influenced by vocal feminists, were accusing all painters using models of establishing a hierarchy of the beholder and, in conspiracy with the viewer, reducing the woman to a victim/object status. But dependency and support were mutual, and Uglow's models and students relished the relationship. His quietly stated observations about art and value set standards that haunt one's conscience. </p> <p>Despite his natural authority, Uglow was frustrated in committee meetings and kept his distance from the Royal Academy or professorships. Briefly a trustee, he was anxious that the National Gallery should acquire, within its means, the best paintings, and was lately an advocate of the Cimabue Madonna staying in the nation. </p> <p>Uglow took food and wine seriously, but his pleasures could be achieved in very simple situations, such as taking in the sunset on Clapham Common during an annual cricket match and picnic. An extended \"family\" ran to hundreds, since the offspring of friends joined their parents in nurturing the attachment. As with many artists, cohabitation was incompatible with concentration, and his marriage to Clare O'Brien in 1963 ended in divorce. </p> <p>At Coldstream's memorial meeting in 1987, Uglow remarked that his friend was a lyrical artist whose late study of daisies against blue-patterned wallpaper showed that he painted \"with the assurance and ruthlessness of a mature artist who did not care if it was 'right' as long as it was beautiful\". </p> <p>One of the first magical Uglows was called Beautiful Girl Lying Down (1959).

      "bodyText": "If the legacy of Euan Uglow, who has died aged 68, were imagined as a string of gems, the rarest would be his beautifully faceted paintings of silent nudes. Equally distinctive are those of solitary fruit or fragile flowers. Although greatly desired by individuals, they were undervalued by exhibition- and collection-making professionals, and are under-represented in museums. Uglow was \"one of Britain's 15 most significant artists\" for Lord Snowdon's group portraits in Vogue on the occasion of the Tate Modern opening. Misleadingly described as a figurative or realist painter, his contribution was actually as radical and experimental as any celebrated postwar artist. The ideas he pursued had nothing to do with language or the camera. Rather, his aim was \"a structured painting full of controlled, and therefore potent, emotion\". Uglow's life centred on south London.
