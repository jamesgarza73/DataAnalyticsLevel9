      "body": "<p>England could still have their coach elect Sven-Goran Eriksson in charge for the game against Spain next month after a day of farce unfolded at Lazio yesterday. </p> <p>According to one report, Eriksson has already agreed to resign after another defeat on Sunday, at home to lowly Napoli. </p> <p>At a meeting with Eriksson at lunch-time, the Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti was reported to have asked the coach to quit. The pair then agreed a pact: Cragnotti would support Eriksson for the rest of the day but Eriksson would announce his resignation today, citing the poor run of results and the fans' loss of confidence in him. </p> <p>But yesterday evening Eriksson, after gaining the backing of some of his key players, met Cragnotti at the president's house to try and convince him that he should stay and that he could get the team back on its feet. </p> <p>Cragnotti agreed to think about it and give his answer today. But it appears that the Lazio vice-president and former Italy manager Dino Zoff yesterday signed a three-year contract to replace Eriksson as coach. </p> <p>Certainly Lazio's tone had altered noticeably after yesterday's meeting. Whereas before they had firmly put down and been rather offended at speculation that he might leave early to take up his England post before the due date of July 1, yesterday the reaction was far more ambivalent. </p> <p>\"Eriksson can stay with the team if he wants to,\" said Cragnotti. \"It's up to him.\" </p> <p>In another interview the president talked about the situation staying as it is \"for now\". And later he added: \"We've discussed what happened yesterday. I can only say that for our part there is no news.\" </p> <p>The \"for our part\" only increased speculation that there may be yet some news from Eriksson. </p> <p>Lazio may have decided to delay the announcement because they did not want to see it splashed across the papers on the club's 100th birthday today. Yet Zoff, who is the club's vice-president, was uncharacteristically bold in flying his colours. \"If they asked me, I would be available to help the team to the limit of my abilities,\" he said. </p> <p>In any event, the Football Association must be hoping that the current situation does not continue for long. It controversially appointed the national side's first foreign coach on the basis of his international success. But Lazio's slump - five wins in their past 12 games in all competitions - has put a dent in his reputation. </p> <p>Lazio lost 2-1 at home to Napoli on Sunday. \"The players still had Christmas cake on their feet,\" said Cragnotti pointedly. </p> <p>For the sake of England's chances in their crucial World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March and against Greece in June, the FA would like Eriksson here as soon as possible. </p> <p>The FA's chief executive Adam Crozier still intends to meet Lazio and Eriksson this month to firm up details of when the Swede can take up the post. Privately, though, he would surely like this meeting to become unnecessary. </p> <p>Yesterday the FA's executive director David Davies preferred to remain diplomatic. \"We want Sven-Goran Eriksson to do well and we are disappointed when Lazio do not win,\" he said, and added: \"Adam Crozier will be meeting with them in the next couple of weeks and we will attempt to resolve any uncertainty about the future.\" </p> <p>According to sources close to the club, the Lazio hierarchy do not blame Eriksson for the mess; the coach can do little about injuries to key players and lack of form from others. </p> <p>The fact that the Italian champions have just pur chased the former Manchester United winger Karel Poborsky and will sign Udinese's Italian international midfielder Stefano Fiore next week suggests that all hope has not yet been abandoned of turning the season around. </p> <p>Replacing the coach in mid-season is not an easy task in Italy, where they are allowed to coach only one club per season. One of Lazio's preferred candidates, Marcello Lippi, is ineligible under this rule. </p> <p>But personal pride aside, Eriksson must be starting to wonder whether he needs the hassle. The fans are increasingly on his back, and the atmosphere at the club is growing more fractious by the day. </p> <p>Recently, at the Lazio training ground, when a TV crew tried to film club officials taking down a banner telling Eriksson to go, one club official attacked the camera crew. He later apologised. </p> <p>On Sunday, Lazio fans and the police fought with visiting supporters. Eighteen people were hospitalised. Napoli fans' cars were attacked and at least one burned. Coaches carrying Napoli fans were also attacked. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The pair then agreed a pact: Cragnotti would support Eriksson for the rest of the day but Eriksson would announce his resignation today, citing the poor run of results and the fans' loss of confidence in him. But yesterday evening Eriksson, after gaining the backing of some of his key players, met Cragnotti at the president's house to try and convince him that he should stay and that he could get the team back on its feet. Cragnotti agreed to think about it and give his answer today. But it appears that the Lazio vice-president and former Italy manager Dino Zoff yesterday signed a three-year contract to replace Eriksson as coach. Certainly Lazio's tone had altered noticeably after yesterday's meeting. Whereas before they had firmly put down and been rather offended at speculation that he might leave early to take up his England post before the due date of July 1, yesterday the reaction was far more ambivalent. \"Eriksson can stay with the team if he wants to,\" said Cragnotti. \"It's up to him.\" In another interview the president talked about the situation staying as it is \"for now\". And later he added: \"We've discussed what happened yesterday. I can only say that for our part there is no news.\" The \"for our part\" only increased speculation that there may be yet some news from Eriksson. Lazio may have decided to delay the announcement because they did not want to see it splashed across the papers on the club's 100th birthday today. Yet Zoff, who is the club's vice-president, was uncharacteristically bold in flying his colours. \"If they asked me, I would be available to help the team to the limit of my abilities,\" he said. In any event, the Football Association must be hoping that the current situation does not continue for long. It controversially appointed the national side's first foreign coach on the basis of his international success. But Lazio's slump - five wins in their past 12 games in all competitions - has put a dent in his reputation. Lazio lost 2-1 at home to Napoli on Sunday. \"The players still had Christmas cake on their feet,\" said Cragnotti pointedly. For the sake of England's chances in their crucial World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March and against Greece in June, the FA would like Eriksson here as soon as possible. The FA's chief executive Adam Crozier still intends to meet Lazio and Eriksson this month to firm up details of when the Swede can take up the post. Privately, though, he would surely like this meeting to become unnecessary. Yesterday the FA's executive director David Davies preferred to remain diplomatic. \"We want Sven-Goran Eriksson to do well and we are disappointed when Lazio do not win,\" he said, and added: \"Adam Crozier will be meeting with them in the next couple of weeks and we will attempt to resolve any uncertainty about the future.\" According to sources close to the club, the Lazio hierarchy do not blame Eriksson for the mess; the coach can do little about injuries to key players and lack of form from others. The fact that the Italian champions have just pur chased the former Manchester United winger Karel Poborsky and will sign Udinese's Italian international midfielder Stefano Fiore next week suggests that all hope has not yet been abandoned of turning the season around. Replacing the coach in mid-season is not an easy task in Italy, where they are allowed to coach only one club per season. One of Lazio's preferred candidates, Marcello Lippi, is ineligible under this rule. But personal pride aside, Eriksson must be starting to wonder whether he needs the hassle. The fans are increasingly on his back, and the atmosphere at the club is growing more fractious by the day. Recently, at the Lazio training ground, when a TV crew tried to film club officials taking down a banner telling Eriksson to go, one club official attacked the camera crew. He later apologised. On Sunday, Lazio fans and the police fought with visiting supporters. Eighteen people were hospitalised. Napoli fans' cars were attacked and at least one burned. Coaches carrying Napoli fans were also attacked. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to editor@footballunlimited.co.uk",

The search facility helps pupils not only to compare but also, through the note-making facility, to synthesise information, so they are encouraged to think through their own ideas. This is an appropriate and convenient study aid, highly recommended. A copy held in the library would be of benefit to groups of up to three students studying at their own pace. \u0095 Read full evaluations of these programs at www.teem.org.uk",

You've no money for buying software and, quite frankly, Access looks a bit complex for year one then you think \"Internet!\"</p> <p>You've heard there is a reservoir of resources \"out there\", wherever that is. All you have to do is log on, run a quick search and turn up dozens of valuable websites.</p> <p>Barely able to contain your excitement, you visit <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">www.google.com</a>, a speedy and reliable search engine, and type in \"literacy\". In just 0.1 of a second your screen is full of website addresses - 1,480,000 of them - which just might stretch you during your one non-contact half hour of the week.</p> <p>How do teachers source and use websites effectively? Finding reliable titles is a problem: there are too many and, unlike print publications, you can't flick through in a few minutes to get a feel for them. You can pick them up from colleagues, professional associations, educational journals, newspapers such as the Guardian, and the Teem (Teachers Evaluating Educational Multimedia) website, which contains evaluations and case studies of websites written and researched by teachers.</p> <p>If you're new to the net, what should you be looking for and how do you spot worthwhile resources for your children? You have already adopted a range of critical skills when you research and buy other resources for school: now it's time to develop them for working on the internet.</p> <p>This brief guide might be a useful tick list to use when you are looking at a new site:</p> <p>\u0095 Who published it? The internet is ruthlessly democratic in the presentation of information, with no perceived hierarchy. Is the site produced by a reputable organisation, or by an amateur hobbyist or by an organisation pursuing its own agenda? </p> <p>\u0095 Is it up-to-date?

      "bodyText": "Your school has just completed its New Opportunities Fund training, your online PC is wired up in the corner of the classroom and you have a nagging feeling that you should be putting your new skills and hardware into action. You've no money for buying software and, quite frankly, Access looks a bit complex for year one then you think \"Internet!\" You've heard there is a reservoir of resources \"out there\", wherever that is. All you have to do is log on, run a quick search and turn up dozens of valuable websites. Barely able to contain your excitement, you visit www.google.com, a speedy and reliable search engine, and type in \"literacy\". In just 0.1 of a second your screen is full of website addresses - 1,480,000 of them - which just might stretch you during your one non-contact half hour of the week. How do teachers source and use websites effectively? Finding reliable titles is a problem: there are too many and, unlike print publications, you can't flick through in a few minutes to get a feel for them. You can pick them up from colleagues, professional associations, educational journals, newspapers such as the Guardian, and the Teem (Teachers Evaluating Educational Multimedia) website, which contains evaluations and case studies of websites written and researched by teachers. If you're new to the net, what should you be looking for and how do you spot worthwhile resources for your children? You have already adopted a range of critical skills when you research and buy other resources for school: now it's time to develop them for working on the internet. This brief guide might be a useful tick list to use when you are looking at a new site: \u0095 Who published it? The internet is ruthlessly democratic in the presentation of information, with no perceived hierarchy. Is the site produced by a reputable organisation, or by an amateur hobbyist or by an organisation pursuing its own agenda? \u0095 Is it up-to-date? A website offering information on political history might be of limited value if it hasn't been updated for a couple of years, whereas an art website with free painting downloads isn't so time-sensitive. \u0095 How quickly does it download? Once accessed, it might contain fantastic resources, but have you got time to watch a fancy moving icon on screen as the class grows increasingly restless? Sharp, well-defined images are wonderful but not if they slow down the lesson. \u0095 Is it really an educational site with classroom relevance or does it contain wonderful ideas that aren't relevant to the national curriculum? \u0095 Will your children be able to navigate the site with ease? Some icon buttons might not be clear to users or they might not always appear on the screen as the child scrolls up and down. Watch out for these features, too: Do you need downloadable plug-ins to make the site work? Is the site linked to other sites? This can be a strength and a weakness: you might discover yet more information but your children might wander off into uncharted territory of unsuitable material. What's the reading level? Is it consistent with the content? Is there evidence of bias? There may be some tempting PSHE and RE sites to visit, but who has written them - and why?

But does ICT suit everyone's learning style? There is evidence that some children are happy to load up or log on and work for a couple of hours at a time, which is something they have found difficult with books and hand-written notes. But like any resource, CD-roms and websites are only part of the solution. So treat them as part of a package of revision and consolidation. \u0095 Nick Austin is an educational consultant and freelance journalist.",

Most UK schools use narrowband, which is rather like passing water through a straw; with broadband, think of high-power hosepipes.

The technology is not new, but until the arrival of broadband, videoconferencing has been a disappointing experience with small, jerky pictures on a PC screen.</p> <p>Broadband technology also promises huge potential for broadcasters and software publishers. Some, like RM, Microsoft, Granada Learning, and the BBC are either developing special content for broadband networks or have introduced software licensing systems that allow them to deliver their educational materials over high-speed networks. </p> <p>The BBC has been delivering a pilot digital curriculum to 50 primary schools across four local education authorities, and has developed materials for key stage three geography students. </p> <p>\"Broadband lets us deliver video as well as the usual web content such as audio, text and graphics, and that's exciting,\" says Hendrik Ball, the BBC's development executive, new media. \"The challenge for us is to move from a system of one-way communication with viewers to a two-way system.\"</p> <p>At present, most schools using broadband are part of major projects or initiatives. The cable and communications company - ntl - has developed the idea of a \"community internet,\" which uses broadband to link homes, schools and the wider community. One idea is for a virtual classroom that brings parents and teachers together. The company says resources could be delivered to the home via a PC or TV. A trial community internet service will be used by 12 schools in Swindon, along with a library and 1,000 homes. </p> <p>\"If you can extend learning into the home, we can bring back people who have been excluded for a variety of reasons,\" says Richard Grazier, ntl's education sector business manager. </p> <p>The Department for Education has provided \u00a337m of match funding to create eight regional broadband consortia, including the East Midlands Broadband Consortium, whose \u00a324m broadband network, developed by a consortium led by ICL, covers 2,000 primary and secondary schools, plus libraries and community centres. The Yorkshire and Humberside Community for Learning has 350 schools inside its network, created by a group including BT, Granada Learning and Espresso.</p> <p>Some city councils and local authorities have also created their own broadband networks. Telford and Wrekin Council, with help from ICL, is developing a \u00a312.5m network that will cover 85 primary and secondary schools.</p> <p>Graham Foster, head of learning resources at Telford and Wrekin, says the aim of the network is to connect schools, libraries, community centres and eventually, health centres and GPs.</p> <p>Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council has created 17 City Learning Centres based at 17 secondary schools, each equipped with a 100-megabit connection. The network is being developed by RM and Telewest. Rachel Mullins, a centre manager, says the network may also be used to provide online mentoring for newly qualified teachers. </p> <p>But there are problems. Adrian Carey, educational director at Edex-CWC is critical of the regional consortia set-up: \"It's a patchwork quilt, and there is no strategy for connecting the consortia to create a national network. I'm sure some duplication is going on.\"</p> <p>But for broadband schools, the benefits have been tremendous. Jenny Noel-Storr is headteacher of Redhill primary school, Telford, which has three computers with broadband connections. \"It's no longer frustrating to use the internet,\" she says. \"I wouldn't want to go back to the old type of connection.\"</p> <p>The children use electronic whiteboards to display material from the web, and to create presentations which are published on the internet.</p> <p>Brinsworth school in Rotherham has 20 PCs with broadband connections in its library, and the computers are booked 90% of the time each week, says assistant head Malcolm Clay. \"We've had to put on two shifts for the lunchtime computer club, such has been the demand.\" </p> <p>But funding is a big issue. Most schools in these projects are having costs heavily subsidised. \"How are schools going to pay for broadband when the funding runs out?\" asks Tim Clark, RM's internet business manager. \"We estimate a broadband service could cost schools around \u00a310,000 a year - excluding any digital content.\"</p> <p>There is at least one potential solution. Steve Molyneaux, Microsoft Professor of learning technologies at Wolverhampton University, and a driving force behind the Telford network, believes that by using the network for e-local government, costs can be cut and used to subsidise education.

BT's Schools Internet Caller service, launched in 1998, offers schools an ISDN link for a flat fee of around \u00a3600 a year, with some restrictions. SIC is used by 23,000 schools.</p> <p>\u0095 ADSL: a digital telephone system offering faster speeds (between 512,000 bps and 2Mbps downstream, and around 256,000 bits upstream).

Not suitable for videoconferencing or school networks with more than 10 PCs.</p> <p>\u0095 Low broadband: the DfEE says all broadband systems should offer a two-megabit connection (seen by many as the bare minimum). BT's Learning Stream, launched last May, offers a two-way 2Mb connection. Prices vary.</p> <p>\u0095 High broadband: these networks typically offer around 100Mb links. (NB this speed does not refer to direct internet connections. Most of these networks have hosting systems that store web content on local servers for fast access.)</p> <p>\u0095 Cable: companies such as ntl and Telewest offer high-speed internet connections over cable TV networks into the home or school at speeds of around 512,000 bits and half this speed out again. Home users pay a flat fee of around \u00a330 a month.</p> <p>\u0095 Satellite: Espresso offers a one-way high-speed service via an Astra satellite. Schools need a small dish and Espresso box (cost \u00a31,500) and receive weekly updates of multimedia material linked to the national curriculum. The service costs \u00a34.50 per pupil per year, and Espresso is launching a secondary school service this year.</p> <p>\u0095 Wireless: a possible solution for schools in rural areas.

Of course, there's nothing new in this: Sharnbrook Upper School in Bedford has been running TV around the school for 15 years. What is new is that digital video editing brings point'n'click ease to an area that was once complex and only for the cognoscenti. And now, once video is digitised it can be sent and shared via standard networks and the internet in just the same way as any other computer file. </p> <p>The latest version of Microsoft's Windows Millennium Edition (ME) operating system comes with digital editing software built in, so that you can copy, paste and edit any digital video clip. </p> <p>Apple has also invested heavily in this area and developed an interface called FireWire to allow computers to communicate with digital cameras and transfer video from camera to computer in real time. This has now become an industry standard, with most major camcorder manufacturers, including Canon and Sony, building a compatible port (which they call IEEE-1394) into their cameras.</p> <p>Want to know what could be this year's best digital media advice? - don't buy a camcorder unless it has a FireWire compatible DV out port.</p> <p>At an event last October Apple paired 16 students from four UK schools together with 16 Apple Masters. The masters were all media, entertainment and academic celebrities who have used Apple computers in their work. Their creative task was to film, edit and present a two-minute movie in two days using only a low-cost Canon MV30i digital camera and an iMac DV computer (it has the FireWire port fitted as standard). </p> <p>The results were stunning as stars like Ken Russell and Hugh Laurie cajoled, encouraged and listened to their young charges. I stood behind Ken Russell as he worked with Emma Downey from Liswerry high school in Wales, and watched as they discussed the use of diagonal shadow and effect on the first clips. The computers running iMovie2 software, which comes as standard on the Mac, allowed simple edits, effects and transitions to be introduced with ease.</p> <p>Watching the groups working I got a sense of what is possible now that neither camera nor computer get in the way of the creative process. </p> <p>Video-making and editing is a natural communication activity which children can excel at. It also provokes talk and creative argument and, most importantly, it can give students a chance to represent their own view rather than be consumed by those of others. </p> <p>\"In the past, non-academic children couldn't shine on film because it was too expensive. Now if you believe in yourself and have access to equipment costing less than \u00a32,000, you can produce something good enough to show a top producer,\" says Floella Benjamin, the TV producer and presenter.</p> <p>I was seeing faces I remember from TV and voices from the airwaves and, yes, they were smaller in real life, but their creative commitment to passing on their skills was clear. Bob Geldof popped in to see the work nearing completion and John Hurt had a creative difference of opinion with Fergus Stuart, his young partner. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Joseph Fiennes worked with Sarah Clarke from Bedford high school. She was more familiar than he with the editing tools - girls at the school regularly use digital video to make their own adverts for completed products made in Design and Technology lessons.</p> <p>The creative experience of the 12-year-olds and mentors showed what is possible with support, equipment and a little creative constraint. Compact cameras, a low-cost computer and a tidal wave of creativity means that schools can now build their own digital video-editing suite for less than \u00a32,000.</p> <p><strong>Further information</strong></p> <p>Visit Microsoft's stand (D30/34) and make you own movie on Apple's stand (E34) at the BETT show (London Olympia, January 10-13).

The masters were all media, entertainment and academic celebrities who have used Apple computers in their work. Their creative task was to film, edit and present a two-minute movie in two days using only a low-cost Canon MV30i digital camera and an iMac DV computer (it has the FireWire port fitted as standard). The results were stunning as stars like Ken Russell and Hugh Laurie cajoled, encouraged and listened to their young charges. I stood behind Ken Russell as he worked with Emma Downey from Liswerry high school in Wales, and watched as they discussed the use of diagonal shadow and effect on the first clips. The computers running iMovie2 software, which comes as standard on the Mac, allowed simple edits, effects and transitions to be introduced with ease. Watching the groups working I got a sense of what is possible now that neither camera nor computer get in the way of the creative process. Video-making and editing is a natural communication activity which children can excel at. It also provokes talk and creative argument and, most importantly, it can give students a chance to represent their own view rather than be consumed by those of others. \"In the past, non-academic children couldn't shine on film because it was too expensive. Now if you believe in yourself and have access to equipment costing less than \u00a32,000, you can produce something good enough to show a top producer,\" says Floella Benjamin, the TV producer and presenter. I was seeing faces I remember from TV and voices from the airwaves and, yes, they were smaller in real life, but their creative commitment to passing on their skills was clear. Bob Geldof popped in to see the work nearing completion and John Hurt had a creative difference of opinion with Fergus Stuart, his young partner. Elsewhere, Joseph Fiennes worked with Sarah Clarke from Bedford high school. She was more familiar than he with the editing tools - girls at the school regularly use digital video to make their own adverts for completed products made in Design and Technology lessons. The creative experience of the 12-year-olds and mentors showed what is possible with support, equipment and a little creative constraint. Compact cameras, a low-cost computer and a tidal wave of creativity means that schools can now build their own digital video-editing suite for less than \u00a32,000. Further information Visit Microsoft's stand (D30/34) and make you own movie on Apple's stand (E34) at the BETT show (London Olympia, January 10-13). See the movie work completed at www.apple.com.",

The annual ICT in technology show kicks off tomorrow at London's Olympia, encouraging teachers to use any means to get there.

You can ask them direct questions as to how training of teachers in ICT has gone so far and see testimonials from satisfied customers. Alongside the perennial and expanded Special Needs Village there is a Publishing Zone, a Software Centre and a Library Resource Centre.</p> <p>The main themes emerging this year are strategies and software for successful whole school management of ICT. The show will also reflect the revolution in educational content publishing - making the best use of faster (broadband) internet connections. </p> <p>And don't forget computer-aided design and control, for so long the poor relations in ICT, which are moving centre stage with events like designing a Formula One car from Denford (D64) with Jaguar Cars.

Build up your own bank of resources that teachers will be able to access at their own convenience.</p> <p>Books come in several categories, starting with technical vs pedagogical. In the former category, there are a range of options, from the highly technical to the self-proclaimed idiots' guides. In principle, the very technical titles should come out of the ICT budget rather than the training budget, since not many teachers will need or want to know about, for example, the intricacies of JavaScript. </p> <p>Buy a range of books, several for each software application, since they tend to approach the subject matter in different ways. It's probably best to avoid books with the word \"idiot\" or \"dummy\" in their titles, because that's not a very good starting point for someone who is already feeling under-confident.</p> <p>There are three main kinds of software-oriented book available. First, there is the \"Teach yourself X in 24 hours\" type. Although the timescale may be a bit of wishful thinking in the real world of teaching, the real strength of this type of book is that it tends to be very highly structured, with an introduction telling you what will be covered, the material itself, and then a summary and a few questions - just like a good lesson in fact!</p> <p>For visual learners, Microsoft's \"Easy\" range is very appealing. Each topic is covered in one or two pages. However, the unique aspect of these books is that rather than containing text accompanied by illustrations, they consist of illustrations accompanied by text - a subtle but important distinction.</p> <p>For very focused skills, such as how to set up tables in Word, consider the Essential Knowledge series from Dorling Kindersley. These are slim, highly illustrated and colourful, and inexpensive - less than a fiver.</p> <p>A new series from Microsoft called <a href=\"http://www.microsoft-troubleshooting.com\">Troubleshooting</a> also looks promising, especially as each title will have its own dedicated website with monthly updates.</p> <p>There are several important books about the pedagogy of ICT, which is an aspect of ICT training that all too often falls by the wayside. </p> <p>An important new book on the market - intended for new teachers but relevant for practising ones - is Primary ICT by Sharp, Potter, Allen and Loveless (see <a href=\"http://www.learningmatters.co.uk\">www.learningmatters.co.uk</a>). Two other books definitely worth a look are Teaching and Learning with ICT in the Primary School, by Leask and Meadows (Routledge Falmer) and Learning to Teach Using ICT in the Secondary School. Perhaps I may be permitted to add my own ebook, Using ICT, which consists of dozens of bullet points and is free.</p> <p>CD-Roms vary in quality and usefulness. Many of the approved NOF training providers disseminate information and materials in this form. There are also a number of training CD-Roms available for the world of commerce, but these tend to be expensive.</p> <p>CD-Roms generally come in two varieties: highly interactive, including sound and video clips, and those which are little more than a repository for hundreds of pages of materials.</p> <p>A particularly useful one, which every school ought to have, is that provided by the Teacher Training Agency - ICT: Identification of Your Training Needs. There are two packages, one for primary and one for secondary (which consists of 3 CDs), each of which is available for both the PC and the Mac. Not only does the CD contain a wealth of material such as video clips, but also a tracking system that enables you to identify your own training needs and make notes as you progress. Being generic, this resource can be used with any other training materials you may be using.</p> <p>No round-up of resources would be complete without a look at online training. Any training organisation worth its salt will have a supporting website, of course, but some forms of training are mainly delivered online. The advantages of online training are that you can work at your own pace any time of the day or night, and that often you can discuss things with colleagues from all over the country via an electronic bulletin board. (Indeed, many NOF training providers include online support and bulletin boards as part of their package.)</p> <p>Look at <a href=\"http://www.knowledgepool.com\">www.knowledgepool.com</a> which has a free sample online lesson to try out. It's also worth keeping an eye on companies which may not be in the training business as such, but who may offer free training for little or no cost. For example, last year <a href=\"http://www.viglen.co.uk\">Viglen</a> offered a series of free seminars around the country. If you cannot get to the BETT show this year, at the very least look through the list of exhibitors at <a href=\"http://www.education-net.co.uk/bett/\">www.education-net.co.uk/bett/</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 Terry Freedman is an ICT adviser in London and the author of Managing ICT (Hodder and Stoughton), Make Time With IT (Questions Publishing) and a free ebook, Using ICT. His website, which is NGfL-approved, is at <a href=\"http://www.ictineducation.org\">www.ictineducation.org</a>.</p>",

Although the timescale may be a bit of wishful thinking in the real world of teaching, the real strength of this type of book is that it tends to be very highly structured, with an introduction telling you what will be covered, the material itself, and then a summary and a few questions - just like a good lesson in fact! For visual learners, Microsoft's \"Easy\" range is very appealing. Each topic is covered in one or two pages. However, the unique aspect of these books is that rather than containing text accompanied by illustrations, they consist of illustrations accompanied by text - a subtle but important distinction. For very focused skills, such as how to set up tables in Word, consider the Essential Knowledge series from Dorling Kindersley. These are slim, highly illustrated and colourful, and inexpensive - less than a fiver. A new series from Microsoft called Troubleshooting also looks promising, especially as each title will have its own dedicated website with monthly updates. There are several important books about the pedagogy of ICT, which is an aspect of ICT training that all too often falls by the wayside. An important new book on the market - intended for new teachers but relevant for practising ones - is Primary ICT by Sharp, Potter, Allen and Loveless (see www.learningmatters.co.uk). Two other books definitely worth a look are Teaching and Learning with ICT in the Primary School, by Leask and Meadows (Routledge Falmer) and Learning to Teach Using ICT in the Secondary School. Perhaps I may be permitted to add my own ebook, Using ICT, which consists of dozens of bullet points and is free. CD-Roms vary in quality and usefulness. Many of the approved NOF training providers disseminate information and materials in this form. There are also a number of training CD-Roms available for the world of commerce, but these tend to be expensive. CD-Roms generally come in two varieties: highly interactive, including sound and video clips, and those which are little more than a repository for hundreds of pages of materials. A particularly useful one, which every school ought to have, is that provided by the Teacher Training Agency - ICT: Identification of Your Training Needs. There are two packages, one for primary and one for secondary (which consists of 3 CDs), each of which is available for both the PC and the Mac. Not only does the CD contain a wealth of material such as video clips, but also a tracking system that enables you to identify your own training needs and make notes as you progress. Being generic, this resource can be used with any other training materials you may be using. No round-up of resources would be complete without a look at online training. Any training organisation worth its salt will have a supporting website, of course, but some forms of training are mainly delivered online. The advantages of online training are that you can work at your own pace any time of the day or night, and that often you can discuss things with colleagues from all over the country via an electronic bulletin board. (Indeed, many NOF training providers include online support and bulletin boards as part of their package.) Look at www.knowledgepool.com which has a free sample online lesson to try out. It's also worth keeping an eye on companies which may not be in the training business as such, but who may offer free training for little or no cost. For example, last year Viglen offered a series of free seminars around the country. If you cannot get to the BETT show this year, at the very least look through the list of exhibitors at www.education-net.co.uk/bett/. \u0095 Terry Freedman is an ICT adviser in London and the author of Managing ICT (Hodder and Stoughton), Make Time With IT (Questions Publishing) and a free ebook, Using ICT. His website, which is NGfL-approved, is at www.ictineducation.org.",

It will not meet the needs of the teachers.\"</p> <p>Even in secondary schools with ICT networks in place, the pressure on machines is such that teachers find it difficult to do their training in the manner envisaged by training consortia.</p> <p>Capita's Learning Network has been well received in many schools. At its heart is a conferencing system, encouraging sharing of ideas and problems by email. Teachers get a set of CD-Roms to take them through a variety of tasks and are monitored by a mentoring team.</p> <p>But participants' feelings about the effectiveness of the training are often mixed. </p> <p>\"The stuff is good,\" said Julie Bridges (not her real name), who teaches in the West Midlands. \"I have used it at school lunchtimes with a small group - it was great, it's just the pressure to do it in your own time.\" </p> <p>Ms Bridges is developing her training at lunchtimes because her secondary school has ICT rooms which are \"block-booked\" on the timetable for use by other departments.</p> <p>The Capita programme expects teachers to devote two to three hours a week to the training over three five-week blocks. It's expected that the bulk of this will be in the classroom working with children, but for Bridges and thousands of other teachers it does not work out that way. She has been working on the materials at home and after school. \"It's finding the two to three hours a week,\" she said.</p> <p>Her concern about the lack of time is echoed by Andrew Moore, an advisory teacher for ICT in the East Riding of Yorkshire. </p> <p>\"Most teachers will argue that it's difficult to find the time for this,\" he said. \"Twilight sessions simply mean that people defer all the other jobs that they have to get done between end of school and midnight.\" </p> <p>Some schools have clearly started their NOF training before they were ready. Schools want to see the training completed and are worried that they need to be in on the act at the beginning. </p> <p>Teachers are aware that ICT training is one of the criteria for passing through the performance threshold. It could be something that heads will expect to see on the CV of staff applying for promoted posts.</p> <p>There's pressure from outside, too. Training providers need to see a revenue stream in place and the government has made this year's Standards Fund monies for ICT-related projects conditional on an ongoing or completed NOF training programme.</p> <p>The result has been a rush to sign up. The Teacher Training Agency estimates that more than 200,000 teachers have signed up for the training, possibly before their schools are ready to benefit from it.</p> <p>This is a point acknowledged by the agency. Yet schools do not even have to begin the process until 2002.</p> <p>\"Schools shouldn't feel pressurised to sign up,\" said NOF's Richard Hill. \"There is no point doing the training until the school has adequate hardware and software - we've been trying quite hard to get that message across.\" </p> <p>Back at Testwood school, Martin Reeves is happy with the training package chosen. The OU/RM training offers a mix of face-to-face and distance learning and his staff are using the opportunity to move their skills forward.</p> <p>But Testwood has \"some of the best facilities in Hampshire\", with seven ICT suites and 150 machines. Reeves is quite clear on the basic issue: \"To do good quality training you do need the equipment to do the job properly.\" To which Julie Bridges would no doubt add: \" and the time\".</p>",

She has been working on the materials at home and after school. \"It's finding the two to three hours a week,\" she said. Her concern about the lack of time is echoed by Andrew Moore, an advisory teacher for ICT in the East Riding of Yorkshire. \"Most teachers will argue that it's difficult to find the time for this,\" he said. \"Twilight sessions simply mean that people defer all the other jobs that they have to get done between end of school and midnight.\" Some schools have clearly started their NOF training before they were ready. Schools want to see the training completed and are worried that they need to be in on the act at the beginning. Teachers are aware that ICT training is one of the criteria for passing through the performance threshold. It could be something that heads will expect to see on the CV of staff applying for promoted posts. There's pressure from outside, too. Training providers need to see a revenue stream in place and the government has made this year's Standards Fund monies for ICT-related projects conditional on an ongoing or completed NOF training programme. The result has been a rush to sign up. The Teacher Training Agency estimates that more than 200,000 teachers have signed up for the training, possibly before their schools are ready to benefit from it. This is a point acknowledged by the agency. Yet schools do not even have to begin the process until 2002. \"Schools shouldn't feel pressurised to sign up,\" said NOF's Richard Hill. \"There is no point doing the training until the school has adequate hardware and software - we've been trying quite hard to get that message across.\" Back at Testwood school, Martin Reeves is happy with the training package chosen. The OU/RM training offers a mix of face-to-face and distance learning and his staff are using the opportunity to move their skills forward. But Testwood has \"some of the best facilities in Hampshire\", with seven ICT suites and 150 machines. Reeves is quite clear on the basic issue: \"To do good quality training you do need the equipment to do the job properly.\" To which Julie Bridges would no doubt add: \" and the time\".",

      "body": "<p><strong> Carmel Fitzsimons qualified last week, but there's no way she's going to be a teacher</strong><br></p> <p>This week, buried in the post with the last limping Christmas cards, came a thin brown envelope containing a certificate. It says, simply, that I am now a Newly Qualified Teacher. </p> <p>Standing in the hall I felt quite young, being new at something again. Then came the deep swelling ocean of gratitude that it was over. After almost two years of two days a week in London schools, countless essays and assignments, and the almost unbearable tension of 10 weeks' teaching practice, I have this tissue-fine piece of paper in my hands saying I've made it. </p> <p>If I had been going to start this term as a class teacher I would probably have gone whooping down to the kitchen to interrupt the kids' breakfast with my great news. As it was, I put the letter in the drawer where I fondly hide the letters from boyfriends who I'd rather liked but realised were not really good for me. It's a cul-de-sac place sort of place. </p> <p>It's a way of saying that I have worked out that I cannot do it. I can do a morning of metaphor or help on a trip to the mosaics at St Albans but I can't do the day-in, no-nights-out stuff. Not for any snooty reason like I can't stand teachers or the pay is rubbish, but because it turned out to be too hard. </p> <p>When I was clocking up 12-hour days in school I became a pharmacist's dream, with every stress-related ailment from 3am sleeplessness through killer cold sores to phantom marking at parties. I found myself congratulating my mother-in-law for sitting so nicely at the table. The job was so tough that waitressing 16-hour shifts at the Cats' Whiskers in Purley was transformed in my memory into the working equivalent of a day in a jacuzzi with Antonio Banderas. </p> <p>It started out so well. I took on the training partly because my Irish emigrant parents had instilled in us that teaching was an honourable profession. My sister had done it without a murmur of complaint, but that might have been because I wasn't really listening. I was also idealistic - wanting to give something back, thinking I could help children from underprivileged families, like my own, to turn their lives around. </p> <p>Perhaps I was naive when I took up the course. It was part-time, so I could still look after my four children and keep up a bit of journalism, which had been my career for 15 years. I had just won a poetry prize and was putting together an anthology for children and I needed to know more about what children were reading. I thought, what with the short school day and the holidays, maybe I could be the Playstation generation Renaissance woman and teach and inspire daily, write in the evening and perhaps fit in poetry in my spare time. </p> <p>What I discovered is that the job itself is the root of the teacher shortage. You can train as many teachers as you like but once they have taken a good hard look at what it involves, few will go for it. There is hope for the young and single and also for those older people who never had families or whose children have long flown the nest. But for anyone who thinks teaching is a family-friendly profession - forget it. </p> <p>A friend who trained as a mature teacher a couple of years ago but is not teaching, said: \"The hours were a nightmare, and when I was not in school I was preparing. I could not get time off to go with my toddler to settle him into nursery and I could not make my older child's parent-teacher evening because we had one, too. Every other job I have ever had has been a thousand times more flexible.\" </p> <p>Certainly the rigidity of school timetabling is a nightmare. You can only go to the toilet when it's break, only phone when it's break and lunch is usually a chance to fix the overhead projector. A teacher's regular diet is Tesco Bourbon biscuits. Although the school day is short, most teachers are in at 7.30am and do not leave until 12 hours later. Then they mark. They work in the holidays, their children go to and from school with child-minders, and worst of all, they worry. </p> <p>As one trainee teacher who decided not to pursue it said to me, \"I thought that I would meet loads of creative Dead Poets' Society people but I just met people who were really into tick-boxes. All the emphasis was on super-organisation.\" </p> <p>I don't think teachers are uncreative - but creativity is being crushed out of them by the grinding cogs of bureaucracy and filing. </p> <p>To give you a glimpse: for every lesson a teacher is supposed to prepare assessment sheets from the previous lesson; they must then reflect upon the issues the assessment throws up. Then they must prepare a lesson plan - based on long-term, medium-term and short-term objectives from the curriculum; and having delivered the lesson, they must write up an evaluation of how the lesson went and then individually assess the progression of each child's learning. This can mean five sheets of written paper per lesson for each of the five lessons a day. Add the individual record of each child, the reading records and the collection of money for the school trip and you start to wonder whether there is any time left for getting your coat on before legging it across the playground. </p> <p>The final straw was the parents. Most of the children were so interesting that I could easily have taken out adoption papers. Even the ones who were sticking lead pencils in each other's legs and who made me cry when they would not listen. But the parents! They swore at teachers as if we were worse than traffic wardens. They thought nothing of taking kids out every Friday to \"go down the caravan\" and the only cultural experience they worshipped was shopping. </p> <p>I look at the wonderful cards my classes have sent me, one with each child making a paper flower to create a bouquet, another a gallery with each child's self-portrait. It's a shame that while schools should be places where all of us can offer our talents, they have become arid academies where only the most totally efficient can survive.I have to say that while in so many ways I love teaching, it is so much easier just writing about it. </p> <p><strong> Bob Hewitt has taught for 30 years, but this will be his last </strong><br></p> <p> I'm a man of principle. And I'm so dim it hurts. Not long ago, we had our open evening for prospective pupils. The school was decked out with displays, the head gave the same speech twice, and the dance teacher and I shared a large classroom from which all furniture had been cleared except three rows of chairs. The place was packed. Thirty pupils put on dance displays while their teacher attended to the CD player. I did a couple of drama sessions. </p> <p>A father sought me out afterwards. \"Excellent,\" he said. \"They were hanging on your every word. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" I lowered my eyes - I'm leaving at Easter. I also put off the dozen kids who were clamouring to know about the next school play - I don't know if there'll be one. </p> <p>For 30 years, I've tried every way I know to stay in teaching because a) I need an income, and b) I've grown to be bloody brilliant at it. I mean, I'm a 56-year-old drama teacher, and the kids still tell me I'm cool. </p> <p>But every year, it has got harder to stay on. I have left jobs in the past: once in the 1980s, when I refused to write a new syllabus I didn't believe in; and again in 1993, when, as an English teacher, I refused to follow the national curriculum (I'd rather be a motorbike courier). And once, in 1996, a contract was not renewed because, though the head said I was a brilliant teacher, he thought I'd get the place shut down when Ofsted came. But now, I am leaving for good. </p> <p>Lesson plans are the problem. They were an excellent discipline when I was a student. I once spent two hours in 1970 getting the words right for the plan for the 40-minute lesson my tutor was going to see. I laid my plan on the desk the following day as the lesson began, and the next time I looked at it was after the bell had gone. I hadn't abandoned it as a policy decision. I'd forgotten it. There and then I resolved never to write one again (and I still got a double distinction for my PGCE). </p> <p>Despite my lack of planning, I became head of drama at a local comprehensive in 1998. Drama is not a national curriculum subject, so I was delighted to take the job. I started in November. Ofsted came a week later. </p> <p>I was teaching a year 11 GCSE class who'd had no teacher since June. My first priority was to give them some success, so we did lots of basic master-and-servant work. The inspector who watched the lesson failed it on both attainment and progress, but he hastened to calm me all the same. \"Don't worry,\" he said. \"You wrought a marvellous transformation in the first five minutes. You'll do wonders with them.\" But the school as a whole was placed in special measures. Out went the head. In came a new man. A straight-down-the-line, this-is-how-it-is, I-take-no-prisoners man. </p> <p>When could he see me teach? Any lesson he wanted, just come in. I saw him a fortnight later at the back of the hall. He stood there for 10 minutes, then came forward to shake my hand. \"Thank you, Bob, for the wonderful things you're doing for the children in this school,\" he said in front of all my year 8s. That was 11 months ago. </p> <p>In March this year, however, he implemented a new Ofsted recommendation. All teachers were to write lesson plans broken down into five-minute segments. My heart sank. </p> <p>How could I tell the head that I won't write lesson plans because I was right when I was 26? How can I tell him that I need my sleep, and that writing lesson plans would send me barmy inside a fortnight (hands up anyone who doesn't know of a teacher who's had a nervous breakdown). So I explain instead that much of my drama work is spontaneous. The only thing I know about any lesson is how I'm going to begin. Because the only way kids will perform spontaneously is if I set them the example. </p> <p>But the head was unimpressed. Of course he was. We were in special measures. His instruction to all staff to write lesson plans in five-minute segments was a recommendation from our very own senior inspector. How could he have made an exception for me? </p> <p>I refused to comply. A former pupil, Lee Simpson, came up from London for my disciplinary hearing. A Comedy Store player for 10 years, he explained that even when he taught at the National Theatre the only thing he knew in advance was the first thing he was going to do. </p> <p>But Lee's evidence made no difference. The book of National Teaching Standards dictates that all lessons be planned. So I was up before the school governors. Twenty former pupils wrote to tell them what a great teacher I am, but they gave me a final written warning. I appealed. My appeal was turned down. The final ultimatum came: I must write lesson plans. </p> <p>I love this job very much, but my instinct was just to let go. \"Refusal to comply with a reasonable instruction is professional misconduct.\" Amen! Oh, amen! What a blessed release dismissal would be! But I have year 11s coming up to their GCSEs next spring, and if I continue to refuse to write the plans the head can't guarantee that I'll be allowed to stay that long. So although there's far less glory walking out the door than being thrown out, I will be writing lesson plans long enough to ensure that I can remain until Easter, and have resigned from that date. </p> <p>Lesson plans are as good a peg as any upon which to hang up my coat. Although the \u00a32,000 threshold would do just as well; or the health and safety rules that have banned my most challenging trust-exercise even though I've used it for 20 years without accident; or the new reward systems that are just cheap bribes; or the setting of targets that have nothing to do with educating children, and everything to do with performance-related pay; or the management's fear of Ofsted; or the new culture of improving all schools by encouraging pupils to inform on their mates. </p> <p>To see schools these days as filled just with bureaucratic bullshit is to seriously miss the point, however. Education has traditionally been about freedom. But there is no freedom anymore. It's gone. Initiative and resourcefulness are banned. Every school has become a part of the gulag. How else could inspectors time the literacy hour with stopwatches, or a teacher be dismissed over a bit of missing paperwork? </p> <p>It's all right for me to say so, mind. I've no more mortgage to pay. The head and the governors want me to stay, and my colleagues urge me to stick with it. \"Just write the blooming lesson plans, Bob! The kids still need what you have to offer!\" Well, maybe, but they'll get by. </p> <p>I'm not happy about leaving. I was hoping to find out whether I could still be cool at 65. And I don't know how to tell my pupils I'm going. And if that father sends his kid to this school because he liked the look of the drama teacher, I won't be here to teach him. But I value my sanity too much to stay. And one thing's for sure: they cannot run gulags on their own.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Carmel Fitzsimons qualified last week, but there's no way she's going to be a teacher This week, buried in the post with the last limping Christmas cards, came a thin brown envelope containing a certificate. It says, simply, that I am now a Newly Qualified Teacher. Standing in the hall I felt quite young, being new at something again. Then came the deep swelling ocean of gratitude that it was over. After almost two years of two days a week in London schools, countless essays and assignments, and the almost unbearable tension of 10 weeks' teaching practice, I have this tissue-fine piece of paper in my hands saying I've made it. If I had been going to start this term as a class teacher I would probably have gone whooping down to the kitchen to interrupt the kids' breakfast with my great news. As it was, I put the letter in the drawer where I fondly hide the letters from boyfriends who I'd rather liked but realised were not really good for me. It's a cul-de-sac place sort of place. It's a way of saying that I have worked out that I cannot do it. I can do a morning of metaphor or help on a trip to the mosaics at St Albans but I can't do the day-in, no-nights-out stuff. Not for any snooty reason like I can't stand teachers or the pay is rubbish, but because it turned out to be too hard. When I was clocking up 12-hour days in school I became a pharmacist's dream, with every stress-related ailment from 3am sleeplessness through killer cold sores to phantom marking at parties. I found myself congratulating my mother-in-law for sitting so nicely at the table. The job was so tough that waitressing 16-hour shifts at the Cats' Whiskers in Purley was transformed in my memory into the working equivalent of a day in a jacuzzi with Antonio Banderas. It started out so well. I took on the training partly because my Irish emigrant parents had instilled in us that teaching was an honourable profession. My sister had done it without a murmur of complaint, but that might have been because I wasn't really listening. I was also idealistic - wanting to give something back, thinking I could help children from underprivileged families, like my own, to turn their lives around. Perhaps I was naive when I took up the course. It was part-time, so I could still look after my four children and keep up a bit of journalism, which had been my career for 15 years. I had just won a poetry prize and was putting together an anthology for children and I needed to know more about what children were reading. I thought, what with the short school day and the holidays, maybe I could be the Playstation generation Renaissance woman and teach and inspire daily, write in the evening and perhaps fit in poetry in my spare time. What I discovered is that the job itself is the root of the teacher shortage. You can train as many teachers as you like but once they have taken a good hard look at what it involves, few will go for it. There is hope for the young and single and also for those older people who never had families or whose children have long flown the nest. But for anyone who thinks teaching is a family-friendly profession - forget it. A friend who trained as a mature teacher a couple of years ago but is not teaching, said: \"The hours were a nightmare, and when I was not in school I was preparing. I could not get time off to go with my toddler to settle him into nursery and I could not make my older child's parent-teacher evening because we had one, too. Every other job I have ever had has been a thousand times more flexible.\" Certainly the rigidity of school timetabling is a nightmare. You can only go to the toilet when it's break, only phone when it's break and lunch is usually a chance to fix the overhead projector. A teacher's regular diet is Tesco Bourbon biscuits. Although the school day is short, most teachers are in at 7.30am and do not leave until 12 hours later. Then they mark. They work in the holidays, their children go to and from school with child-minders, and worst of all, they worry. As one trainee teacher who decided not to pursue it said to me, \"I thought that I would meet loads of creative Dead Poets' Society people but I just met people who were really into tick-boxes. All the emphasis was on super-organisation.\" I don't think teachers are uncreative - but creativity is being crushed out of them by the grinding cogs of bureaucracy and filing. To give you a glimpse: for every lesson a teacher is supposed to prepare assessment sheets from the previous lesson; they must then reflect upon the issues the assessment throws up. Then they must prepare a lesson plan - based on long-term, medium-term and short-term objectives from the curriculum; and having delivered the lesson, they must write up an evaluation of how the lesson went and then individually assess the progression of each child's learning. This can mean five sheets of written paper per lesson for each of the five lessons a day. Add the individual record of each child, the reading records and the collection of money for the school trip and you start to wonder whether there is any time left for getting your coat on before legging it across the playground. The final straw was the parents. Most of the children were so interesting that I could easily have taken out adoption papers. Even the ones who were sticking lead pencils in each other's legs and who made me cry when they would not listen. But the parents! They swore at teachers as if we were worse than traffic wardens. They thought nothing of taking kids out every Friday to \"go down the caravan\" and the only cultural experience they worshipped was shopping. I look at the wonderful cards my classes have sent me, one with each child making a paper flower to create a bouquet, another a gallery with each child's self-portrait. It's a shame that while schools should be places where all of us can offer our talents, they have become arid academies where only the most totally efficient can survive.I have to say that while in so many ways I love teaching, it is so much easier just writing about it. Bob Hewitt has taught for 30 years, but this will be his last I'm a man of principle. And I'm so dim it hurts. Not long ago, we had our open evening for prospective pupils. The school was decked out with displays, the head gave the same speech twice, and the dance teacher and I shared a large classroom from which all furniture had been cleared except three rows of chairs. The place was packed. Thirty pupils put on dance displays while their teacher attended to the CD player. I did a couple of drama sessions. A father sought me out afterwards. \"Excellent,\" he said. \"They were hanging on your every word. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" I lowered my eyes - I'm leaving at Easter. I also put off the dozen kids who were clamouring to know about the next school play - I don't know if there'll be one. For 30 years, I've tried every way I know to stay in teaching because a) I need an income, and b) I've grown to be bloody brilliant at it. I mean, I'm a 56-year-old drama teacher, and the kids still tell me I'm cool. But every year, it has got harder to stay on. I have left jobs in the past: once in the 1980s, when I refused to write a new syllabus I didn't believe in; and again in 1993, when, as an English teacher, I refused to follow the national curriculum (I'd rather be a motorbike courier). And once, in 1996, a contract was not renewed because, though the head said I was a brilliant teacher, he thought I'd get the place shut down when Ofsted came. But now, I am leaving for good. Lesson plans are the problem. They were an excellent discipline when I was a student. I once spent two hours in 1970 getting the words right for the plan for the 40-minute lesson my tutor was going to see. I laid my plan on the desk the following day as the lesson began, and the next time I looked at it was after the bell had gone. I hadn't abandoned it as a policy decision. I'd forgotten it. There and then I resolved never to write one again (and I still got a double distinction for my PGCE). Despite my lack of planning, I became head of drama at a local comprehensive in 1998. Drama is not a national curriculum subject, so I was delighted to take the job. I started in November. Ofsted came a week later. I was teaching a year 11 GCSE class who'd had no teacher since June. My first priority was to give them some success, so we did lots of basic master-and-servant work. The inspector who watched the lesson failed it on both attainment and progress, but he hastened to calm me all the same. \"Don't worry,\" he said. \"You wrought a marvellous transformation in the first five minutes. You'll do wonders with them.\" But the school as a whole was placed in special measures. Out went the head. In came a new man. A straight-down-the-line, this-is-how-it-is, I-take-no-prisoners man. When could he see me teach? Any lesson he wanted, just come in. I saw him a fortnight later at the back of the hall. He stood there for 10 minutes, then came forward to shake my hand. \"Thank you, Bob, for the wonderful things you're doing for the children in this school,\" he said in front of all my year 8s. That was 11 months ago. In March this year, however, he implemented a new Ofsted recommendation. All teachers were to write lesson plans broken down into five-minute segments. My heart sank. How could I tell the head that I won't write lesson plans because I was right when I was 26? How can I tell him that I need my sleep, and that writing lesson plans would send me barmy inside a fortnight (hands up anyone who doesn't know of a teacher who's had a nervous breakdown). So I explain instead that much of my drama work is spontaneous. The only thing I know about any lesson is how I'm going to begin. Because the only way kids will perform spontaneously is if I set them the example. But the head was unimpressed. Of course he was. We were in special measures. His instruction to all staff to write lesson plans in five-minute segments was a recommendation from our very own senior inspector. How could he have made an exception for me? I refused to comply. A former pupil, Lee Simpson, came up from London for my disciplinary hearing. A Comedy Store player for 10 years, he explained that even when he taught at the National Theatre the only thing he knew in advance was the first thing he was going to do. But Lee's evidence made no difference. The book of National Teaching Standards dictates that all lessons be planned. So I was up before the school governors. Twenty former pupils wrote to tell them what a great teacher I am, but they gave me a final written warning. I appealed. My appeal was turned down. The final ultimatum came: I must write lesson plans. I love this job very much, but my instinct was just to let go. \"Refusal to comply with a reasonable instruction is professional misconduct.\" Amen! Oh, amen! What a blessed release dismissal would be! But I have year 11s coming up to their GCSEs next spring, and if I continue to refuse to write the plans the head can't guarantee that I'll be allowed to stay that long. So although there's far less glory walking out the door than being thrown out, I will be writing lesson plans long enough to ensure that I can remain until Easter, and have resigned from that date. Lesson plans are as good a peg as any upon which to hang up my coat. Although the \u00a32,000 threshold would do just as well; or the health and safety rules that have banned my most challenging trust-exercise even though I've used it for 20 years without accident; or the new reward systems that are just cheap bribes; or the setting of targets that have nothing to do with educating children, and everything to do with performance-related pay; or the management's fear of Ofsted; or the new culture of improving all schools by encouraging pupils to inform on their mates.

      "body": "<p>The publication deadline passed with the old year, the census date of March 31 looms. Soon the Research Assessment Exercise will pass out of the hands of universities and into those of the assessment panels. </p> <p>The fifth assessment exercise is the third presided over by Bahram Bekhradnia, the Higher Education Funding Council for England's director of policy. Bekhradnia, 52, worked at the then Department of Education and Science for nearly 20 years, but is far from being the archetypal civil servant. He is disposed to talk to journalists rather than brandish a clove of garlic and shuffle them off towards the nearest press officer and has a longstanding taste for colourful bow-ties. In his early days at the department he was a DJ with a mobile disco purveying 60s sounds - a role he reprised recently for birthday parties. </p> <p>Nor are many senior British public servants natives of Iran. Bekhradnia came here at 18 months after his father was blinded in a local war between Iran and the Soviet Union over influence in Azerbaijan. \"He came first for medical treatment, then he and my mother decided life would be better for him here than in Iran,\" Bekhradnia explains. </p> <p>Those origins supplied his name - he recalls without apparent rancour that Mark Carlisle, Secretary of State for Education and Science from 1979 to 1981, was incapable of remembering it and addressed him as \"Bannerjee\" - and a passion for Iranian food. </p> <p>Otherwise there are few traces of his roots. He speaks only \"pidgin Farsi\", explaining: \"My parents were very concerned that I should be immersed as far as possible in the English way of life, to the extent of sending me away to boarding school.\" </p> <p>Their policy was spectacularly successful. He won a scholarship to Wellington College, read classics at University College, Oxford, and for the last decade has been one of the key figures in the formation of English higher education policy - influence now reinforced by having been at the funding council far longer than any other comparably senior figure. \"I have become part of the corporate memory - the person who points out that we did something five years ago, or alternately that we didn't and why.\" </p> <p>He predates the higher funding council having joined the Universities Funding Council from the department in 1991. His last Whitehall job was dealing with teacher shortages, an area of such sensitivity that it is little wonder he appears capable of coping with most higher education complexities in a genial, relaxed manner. It also helped crystallise some discomfort with Whitehall traditions. \"What I found very difficult was the constraint on the way you think and talk. You had to stick very closely to the policy line.\" </p> <p>He has enjoyed the funding council more. \"I have found it very liberating. Hefce straddles the two worlds of the civil service and academia, but it is close to academics, has always been led by them and has been influenced by their attitude to open discussion.\" </p> <p>Part of his job is to supply information on which those debates and decisions can be based. \"The other directorates cover finance and corporate affairs, and relations with institutions. That leaves me with the sector-wide issues - examples are our recent research review, committees I chaired on East European studies and Chinese studies, the Joint Information Systems committee and the development of policies on access and participation. I should hate people to think that the Research Assessment Exercise is all that I do,\" he says. </p> <p>Even so he does not flinch when described as \"the architect of the RAE\". He notes that the assessment exercise is not a policy in itself, but a device for the implementation of a policy - selective research funding. \"We need a system which is transparent, based on academic judgments and gives us a basis for those judgments.

      "bodyText": "The publication deadline passed with the old year, the census date of March 31 looms. Soon the Research Assessment Exercise will pass out of the hands of universities and into those of the assessment panels. The fifth assessment exercise is the third presided over by Bahram Bekhradnia, the Higher Education Funding Council for England's director of policy. Bekhradnia, 52, worked at the then Department of Education and Science for nearly 20 years, but is far from being the archetypal civil servant. He is disposed to talk to journalists rather than brandish a clove of garlic and shuffle them off towards the nearest press officer and has a longstanding taste for colourful bow-ties. In his early days at the department he was a DJ with a mobile disco purveying 60s sounds - a role he reprised recently for birthday parties. Nor are many senior British public servants natives of Iran. Bekhradnia came here at 18 months after his father was blinded in a local war between Iran and the Soviet Union over influence in Azerbaijan. \"He came first for medical treatment, then he and my mother decided life would be better for him here than in Iran,\" Bekhradnia explains. Those origins supplied his name - he recalls without apparent rancour that Mark Carlisle, Secretary of State for Education and Science from 1979 to 1981, was incapable of remembering it and addressed him as \"Bannerjee\" - and a passion for Iranian food. Otherwise there are few traces of his roots. He speaks only \"pidgin Farsi\", explaining: \"My parents were very concerned that I should be immersed as far as possible in the English way of life, to the extent of sending me away to boarding school.\" Their policy was spectacularly successful. He won a scholarship to Wellington College, read classics at University College, Oxford, and for the last decade has been one of the key figures in the formation of English higher education policy - influence now reinforced by having been at the funding council far longer than any other comparably senior figure. \"I have become part of the corporate memory - the person who points out that we did something five years ago, or alternately that we didn't and why.\" He predates the higher funding council having joined the Universities Funding Council from the department in 1991. His last Whitehall job was dealing with teacher shortages, an area of such sensitivity that it is little wonder he appears capable of coping with most higher education complexities in a genial, relaxed manner. It also helped crystallise some discomfort with Whitehall traditions. \"What I found very difficult was the constraint on the way you think and talk. You had to stick very closely to the policy line.\" He has enjoyed the funding council more. \"I have found it very liberating. Hefce straddles the two worlds of the civil service and academia, but it is close to academics, has always been led by them and has been influenced by their attitude to open discussion.\" Part of his job is to supply information on which those debates and decisions can be based. \"The other directorates cover finance and corporate affairs, and relations with institutions. That leaves me with the sector-wide issues - examples are our recent research review, committees I chaired on East European studies and Chinese studies, the Joint Information Systems committee and the development of policies on access and participation. I should hate people to think that the Research Assessment Exercise is all that I do,\" he says. Even so he does not flinch when described as \"the architect of the RAE\". He notes that the assessment exercise is not a policy in itself, but a device for the implementation of a policy - selective research funding. \"We need a system which is transparent, based on academic judgments and gives us a basis for those judgments. I am aware of its weaknesses, but my challenge to critics is to suggest a better, equally rational way of identifying excellence and then funding it.\" And the council has been responsive to concerns about the exercise, he says. \"A good example was after the 1992 exercise where there were very strong representations that the publications count was encouraging premature and excessive publication and we decided to stop collecting that information.\" While accepting that the salience of the assessment exercise may have led to the downgrading of non-RAE activity, he argues that it is up to the universities to ensure that those activities are recognised and rewarded. An inhabitant of that well-known academic stronghold, north Oxford, Bekhradnia understands some professional grievances. \"I feel a great deal of sympathy for academics of my age, who went into the profession knowing that the pay would never be very good, but on the assumption that they would have great personal freedom to pursue their interest in their subject. That assumption has been eroded. Staff-student ratios have deterioriated, they have much more teaching to do and research funding has not kept pace with expansion.\" He accepts that selectivity and its associated mechanisms have created greater stress among academics, but says: \"It is hard to argue that there should not be accountability to ensure that public money has been properly spent and I think it a good thing that academics should publish.\" He argues that the exercise has improved university research strategy and that while research funding is selective it is very hard to imagine there not being some sort of assessment exercise.

The joint proposal by the NCH, formerly the National Children's Homes, and the National Society also calls for new legislation to prosecute people who use electronic means, such as websites and internet chat rooms, to misrepresent their age with the view to meeting children. The charities have formed a working party with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the Association of Chief Officers of Probation (ACOP) and the Association of Directors of Social Services, which is meeting on February 19 to finalise the proposals. John Carr, internet adviser at the NCH and co-ordinator of the campaign, said the proposals would extend existing internet training for teachers. \"We are dealing with a generation of social workers and probation officers for whom the internet is a foreign country,\" said Mr Carr. He said the first step was to raise professionals' awareness of the technology, explaining what an internet service provider or a browser is. They would then need to know how to check whether the internet was being used to ensnare children. \"If there was an internet connection in a home where there was a child protection investigation, a social worker will need to be able to check whether it was being used to download hard core pornography to groom potential victims, for example,\" explained Mr Carr. \"Similarly a probation officer working with an offender would need to check whether their use of the internet was likely to lead to them re-offending.\" \"We want adults who misrepresent their age to a legal minor with a view to meeting them in the real world using electronic means to be prosecuted, as a deterrent,\" he added.

Mary Marsh, director of the NSPCC, said: \"The most hazardous place for children is their own bedrooms where they have unsupervised access to the net or in situations where they are supervised by adults unfamiliar with the technology.\"",

Two women and one man were arrested after the incident in Bristol, which left Mr Blair with an over-ripe tomato splattered across the back of his left shoulder. His Prime Ministerial convoy was ambushed by protesters outside the City of Bristol College which he had arrived to officially open. What had been a handful of peaceful demonstrators carrying banners protesting against sanctions on Iraq suddenly swelled to 20 or 30 as the Prime Minister's motorcade drew up. Several tomatoes hurled from the crowd hit the roadway before one scored a direct hit on the Prime Minister who did not flinch. Other demonstrators tried to lunge towards him but were held back by police, who were swiftly reinforced by mounted officers. Small oranges were also thrown as the crowd screamed abuse. Inside the college campus one woman yelled at Mr Blair from only feet away: \"How many Iraqi children have you killed?\" Meanwhile, the Conservative party has today reasserted its claim to be the guardians of low taxation and sound economic management, launching a poster campaign aimed at wooing voters disillusioned by the government's performance on the issue. However the party's fightback has been undermined by the early unveiling of the posters - some of which were on public display at the end of last week - and by a fuss over a failed attempt by the party to project its low tax message on to the side of the Millennium Dome. The posters, unveiled today by party leader William Hague and his shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, challenge New Labour's claim to have used increased tax revenues to improve key public services. \"You've paid the tax, so where are the teachers?\" runs one of the three slogans. The others ask about police numbers and hospital operations. This morning Conservative chairman Michael Ancram accused Labour of reneging on its promises on taxation. \"The point of the campaign is to remind people what has happened since the last election,\" he said. \"Labour has broken nearly all the promises they made. \"They promised they wouldn't put taxes up, everybody knows that taxes have gone up, the average working family is now paying \u00a3670 more than they were at the last election,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

ITV bosses will confirm tomorrow that News at Ten is to be revived with Sir Trevor McDonald at the helm. Journalists and programme editors at ITN have been put on standby for a 22 January launch. It is not clear whether Sir Trevor will be signed up for every news bulletin however. This is because in the compromise deal thrashed out between ITV bosses at regulators at the Independent Television Commission, the network is only obliged to bring back the 32 year old institution on three nights a week. It is believed that the Sir Trevor, 61, is unwilling to front bulletin on the nights that it goes out at 11pm, but that he is committed to presenting the programme on the three nights a week that it goes out at 10pm. Sources say the name of the programme has yet to be confirmed, but bosses are said to favour \"Nightly News at Ten\", which allows the network to keep both its news brands intact. The move would have the added advantages that it allows ITV to claim it has not caved in to pressure to reinstate News at Ten, and gives it scheduling flexibility. The programme will not return to its former half-hour length, however. Meanwhile, speculation continues that ITN is considering relaunching its 6.30 bulletin with two presenters.

The pace of the latter is striking - eight years ago 98% of care provided by social services in England, such as meals on wheels and personal care, came from local authorities' in-house workforces - by 1999 just under half did so.</p> <p>Privatisation through the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) saw a dramatic reduction in the number of workers employed. Competition meant cutting labour costs, which were cut by lowering labour standards. Workloads increased, terms and conditions deteriorated, and a spate of scandals concerning dirty hospitals and schools followed. Some of the lowest paid workers in Britain saw their wages fall lower still. After privatisation, they often ceased to be regarded as part of the school or hospital team. A study in Rotherham found that \"cleaners were no longer seen as integral to the school staff as a whole a member of staff commented that Christmas parties used to be for the whole school - cleaners and all - but after CCT it was hard to know who to invite\". </p> <p>Equal opportunity policies were of little value when CCT was involved. The equal opportunities commission (EOC) in Northern Ireland found a \"minimal\" consideration of equal opportunity issues in the competitive tendering process, despite the universal existence of such policies in the boards and trusts concerned. There was \"no evidence that any steps were taken to ensure that the process was free of gender bias when services were chosen to be tendered, when tenders were assessed, or in the period after the award of contracts\". </p> <p>When ancillary services are privatised, be it by private finance initiative (PFI) schemes, best value or market testing it is likely to result in inferior terms and conditions for the staff; if not the existing ones, then for the new recruits.

The consequences of the absence of such policies are well known but difficult to quantify. The public sector, for all its failings, generally offers better family-friendly provisions than the private sector (one of the reasons why the latter is often cheaper) whether it is flexitime, job sharing, parental leave, working from home or child care subsidy. </p> <p>A third of public sector workplaces offer job-sharing to their women workers; only 15% of private sector employers do so. The EOC study notes: \"None of the companies provided contractual maternity benefits. Their employees were dependent on statutory provisions. In comparison, board/trust employees had access to paid maternity leave after one year's service.\" </p> <p>With CCT, and arguably now with PFI, a narrow, accountant's view of efficiency prevails, but the meaningful is not always measurable. Playwright Dennis Potter, in his famous valedictory interview, makes the point well: \" everything was given its price-tag, and the price-tag became the only gospel. And that gospel is very thin gruel indeed. If you start measuring human kind in those terms, everything else becomes less important, or laughable - all the things that bind us as a community\". </p> <p>\u0095 Sanjiv Sachdev is a senior lecturer in human resource management, Kingston University</p>",

The EOC study notes: \"None of the companies provided contractual maternity benefits. Their employees were dependent on statutory provisions. In comparison, board/trust employees had access to paid maternity leave after one year's service.\" With CCT, and arguably now with PFI, a narrow, accountant's view of efficiency prevails, but the meaningful is not always measurable. Playwright Dennis Potter, in his famous valedictory interview, makes the point well: \" everything was given its price-tag, and the price-tag became the only gospel. And that gospel is very thin gruel indeed. If you start measuring human kind in those terms, everything else becomes less important, or laughable - all the things that bind us as a community\". \u0095 Sanjiv Sachdev is a senior lecturer in human resource management, Kingston University",

We still need far more to deliver affordable housing.\" The levels of affordable housing being asked for in the south-east and south-west have so far been achieved in few places. A rare example is the Imperial Wharf scheme in Hammersmith, where the local council gave permission for the development on the grounds that exactly half of the apartments would be set aside for social housing. Nevertheless, John Adams, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Housing's south-east branch, is optimistic about the planning system's ability to deliver the affordable housing goods. He argues that local authorities should insist more robustly that a share of all house building sites is earmarked for social housing. The lower profits that the house builder makes on his development, says Mr Adams, could be passed on to landowners who can better afford to take a cut because of high land prices. \"Many of them have already had a windfall of \u00a3700,000 an acre,\" he says.",

She has bought a book called Eat Right 4 Your Type by a Dr Peter J D'Adamo, whose theory holds that each blood type demands a different diet. Apparently this is how Martine McCutcheon lost weight.

In fact, it's anything but. And here's the rub - shhhhh! - it's been a secret. I really didn't want any of my avid smoking friends to know. So I have remained isolated and furtive in an attempt to be . . . a secret non-smoker. </p> <p>Only a paltry 50,000 out of an estimated two million quitters at the turn of the millennium are still on course. On this evidence, smokers have a one in 40 chance of giving up. </p> <p>So it was a real piece of luck because on that night it was my 40th attempt. I was on a promise. As Big Ben struck for the year 2000, I exhaled, stubbed out, and said goodbye to a very old friend. \"I love you,\" I mumbled, while sipping my millennium champagne. Who was I to rely on now? </p> <p>I started smoking Dunhill while at college. I liked the colour of the pack, and thought it gave me an added level of sophistication. At that stage I thought it was just for fun. But when John Player Special released an all-black packet that was 20p cheaper, I immediately swapped allegiance. By then I was using my addiction in many positive ways. I made an entire coffee table from used packets. It didn't take long and I felt encouraged as I glued each new section in place. I took still-life photographs of backlit empty packs, next to a old shoe. It was supposed to mean something, but I can't remember what now. </p> <p>By the time I'd left college, I knew it was impossible to stop without some effort, so I changed to a low-tar brand. And I knew I was in trouble when many a time I desperately searched for fag butts in the ash tray at the end of an evening. </p> <p>But what was going to replace the void left if I did quit? What else can you light, inhale, flick, exhale? It occupies your hands, your mind and provides solace and security when all else fails. And all the while smokers have each other to bolster themselves. </p> <p>Smokers notoriously want quitters to fall back into their old ways. And as many of my friends smoked I knew better than to admit to a campaign of denial. So I took a vow not to reveal my decision to stop. I claimed a bad cold or irritating cough was the reason I was having a \"short break\" from fags. (Which was not actually that untrue, as two weeks into the regime, I developed a hacking splutter that lasted a month.) </p> <p>As time went on my secret became more difficult to deal with. So I became a master at non-smoking excuses. As the dinner party between -courses ciggies appeared, I would nip out of the room on some arbitrary excuse, or wave my hand to indicate I was still eating. A favourite was a short cough immediately followed by mumbling: \"Not just now, thanks.\" </p> <p>Why carry on with this ridiculous charade? Well smokers have a special camaraderie. It's like a club, a perfect relationship that can only be acquired between people who understand. Demand a smoker gives up and they will immediately take out a Silk Cut to blow smoke in your face. Smokers are only too happy to flaunt their habit, after all it's legal, rebellious and can be justified by providing the government with a huge income. </p> <p>And more importantly how could I turn my back on the smokers' clan? The allure, fascination and desire to smoke is entwined with the need to be part of the fag fraternity. All those clandestine meetings, the conspiratorial whispers as the packet is slowly stripped of its cellophane cover; and the snort at non-smokers' efforts to make us stop. The smokers' clan is a powerful group, attack it and it redoubles its efforts to fight back. Kick the addicts and they bounce straight back up, cigarettes blazing. Ban us from the kitchen, and we move to the bathroom; ban us from the hall, we traipse into the garden; evict us from the office, and we happily pollute the street. </p> <p>It was always us against the rest of the world - especially all those holier-than-thou do gooders. Go into a bar and what do you see - row upon row of smokers, laughing, joking and sharing. Watch the elegant French ladies on the beach and they come with a smoking stick in hand. But enter the pious world of west-coast anal America and they will shoot on sight if you so much as move a hand to your inside pocket. Get a life, we'd snigger. </p> <p>And that is where a smokers' dilemma really does kick in, as we all know the real truth. It is a killer, and the life at risk is ours. Every year, around this time, we endure those appalling smoking statistics. The personal account of lung disease; the horrifying number of related premature deaths; the deep financial expense. </p> <p>Yet all these shock-horror images and powerful words hold many back not a jot. Millions choose to carry on smoking despite the damning evidence. And the reasons for doing so are far more complex than addiction to nicotine. </p> <p>But one year on, as I greeted 2001 it dawned on me: I am still surrounded by the same people as before, and that ever-present monkey on my back has gone. It's good not to live with the sub-conscious fear of some appalling illness. It's good not to have to slap my pockets to ensure the fags and matches are there, and it's good not to have to clear away the remains of a night's inhalation. </p> <p>And I don't care who knows anymore.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pan-European investment news aggregator EuropeanInvestor.com has raised \u00a32.2m in second-round funding. The move brings a small ray of hope to the beleaguered new media sector. The online financial news sector has seen string of recent casualties as TheStreet.co.uk, The Motley Fool Germany and EO.net pulled the plug on their news sites. EuropeanInvestor.com has raised the money from first-round investors Vertex Singapore and finance group Cairnwood, and is intended to bolster the company's technology infrastructure and staff development. The Brussels-based stock market news and quotes site described the last year as being \"enormously successful\", however it was marked by significant shift in direction and the redundancy of a team of journalists and analysts. Launched in October 1999, the site produced original news content from a team of journalists, but shifted towards content aggregation, buying in its content from a range of news agencies including Reuters and AFX, rather than producing its own. This shift was matched by a move into providing business-orientated aggregation service to institutions and to other websites, a practise the company describes as a b2b2c model. The company offers stock market data and news from 14 European exchanges, aiming to offer an overview of the European business scene. The company lists Citibank, First-E, BT, KBN, Orange and Proximus among its customers. Last year Reuters Greenhouse, the venture capital arm of the business information group, led a $21m investment in news aggregator Moreover.com. The company backed an aggregator while declining to invest in a content provider it had been in negotiation with - the pan-European new economy magazine and website Tornado-Insider.com.",

      "bodyText": "Beijing's official reaction to the \"Tiananmen Papers\" emerged with unusual speed today - only three days after the contents of the dossier were revealed in the US. Yet however much China insists that the collection consists of \"fabricated materials and distorted facts\", the new debate about responsibility for the Beijing massacre of June 1989 can hardly be stopped. The papers raise obvious awkward questions about the role of several current leaders and the collective responsibility of the Communist party which still rules China. They may also revive some critical arguments over the tactics of the pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square. By reacting so swiftly, Beijing seems to acknowledge that it cannot prevent the contents of the documents circulating internally. Indeed, China's web guerrillas leapt into action within a day of the news breaking. On the main People's Daily discussion group, one of them slipped in a tersely subversive message just before the site closed down for the night. \"Web friends,\" it said simply, \"our day has come!\" The message was promptly spiked by the unseen monitor, with a note that it was a \"mistaken document\". Another anonymous writer posted a more subtle message, urging that a Chinese-language news website in the US should be blocked. Others chimed in complaining that the offending site carried \"politically reactionary content\" which would be banned on the mainland. The site in question - whose address was posted helpfully by the alleged complainants - just happened to carry news reports of the Tiananmen Papers. In the 21st century world of instant communications and proxy servers, young Chinese wishing to read the unexpurgated version of why and how their leaders smashed the aspirations of a previous generation of Chinese youth in 1989 will have little difficulty. They will read how the former Communist party secretary-general Zhao Ziyang argued in vain for dialogue with the students, telling the council of elders headed by Deng Xiaoping that the party had lost credibility. Mr Zhao has been under virtual house arrest ever since, a forgotten hero - but these documents could revive his memory. They will learn how Mr Zhao's arch-rival, the then premier, Li Peng, played on the fears of the ancient generals and revolutionary veterans by insinuating that the students in the square were manipulated by Taiwan and the CIA. They will learn too that Jiang Zemin, now president of China, was set on his path to power by a secret decision of the Council of Elders to place him in Mr Zhao's position. The decision - taken before the dreadful night of June 3-4, 1989 - does not actually implicate Mr Jiang in the slaughter which took place. But it brings him closer to it by association, as well as having been constitutionally incorrect. Extracts from the Tiananmen Papers are published today in a book edited by two prominent US China scholars, Andrew Nathan and Perry Link. It would seem almost impossible to forge a collection of such length and detail, but in spite of the editors' reputation, the question of authenticity still has to be raised. The documents are only a selection from what are said to amount to 15,000 pages in translated English text, smuggled out by a \"disaffected civil servant\" from China with the apparent backing of reformists in the leadership today. Unfortunately, the editors have chosen not to release the original Chinese texts - which would provide a more reliable test - until later. Nor can we assume that every document in the collection is of equal reliability. However, the material published so far is consistent with what we already know about the bitter leadership debate of those tense weeks. And several documents circulating at the time in Tiananmen Square also gave (much more briefly) a similar account of the malign role of Li Peng and the elders' paranoia on which he played. It must also be acknowledged that the new documents appear to provide justification for criticisms later made of the students' tactics. Admittedly they had little incentive to engage in creative diplomacy while the government dithered and ignored their demands for \"dialogue\". But by staying in the square even when President Gorbachev arrrived on a state visit, and by giving no hint that they would ever leave, the students seem to have tipped the balance in the secret debate in Mr Deng's residence. The loss of public face was too much for the octogenarian generals and party veterans to bear. Significantly it was Deng Yingchao, widow of the late Premier Zhou Enlai (widely regarded as a moderate figure) who summed up the elders' beleaguered psychosis. \"Retreat means that we fall, that the People's Republic falls, that a capitalist restoration wins: it will be what that American (the 1950s US Secretary of state John Foster) Dulles hoped for, that our socialism would turn into capitalism after a few generations,\" she said. In more bellicose mood, ex-General Wang Zhen raged: \"The students are nuts if they think this handful of people can overthrow our people and government.\" This \"us or them\" mentality chimes with the remarks of another ex-general, Yang Shangkun, in a speech summarising the elders' views which was reported unofficially at the time in a leaflet circulating in Tiananmen Square. \"(They) all agreed that there was no way to retreat\", said Yang. \"If we did we would fall from power. Capitalism would be restored. Just as the American Dulles had hoped, after several generations our socialism would turn into liberalism.\" Yang quoted Chen Yun ( in his 80s like the other elders) as warning that this would mean \"negating the Communist party\". Political discussion has been artificially held back ever since 1989: Chinese reformers are still unable to raise the sort of questions which were openly debated in the mid-1980s about the need for internal party democracy and accountability of the government to the people. The release of these documents abroad may serve to re-open some of these arguments and loosen the inhibition of discussing the past. China's leadership and people have moved on, and no one expects a repeat of the activism or the repression of 1989. Yet the fundamental problem remains much the same - how to promote political as well as economic reform without panicking the power-holders.

There are times, as in 1992, when governments can win elections even when the economy is in recession, and there are times, as in 1997, when they can lose them even though all the economic indicators are looking good. In 1992, despite record bankruptcies, record home repossessions and unemployment close to 3m, John Major won a narrow victory because hard-pressed voters appeared to believe that life would become even tougher under Neil Kinnock. But within months of that victory, the Conservative party's entire economic strategy was wrecked by the financial speculation that led to the pound's ejection from the exchange rate mechanism. Although the economy subsequently recovered, voters neither forgave nor forgot the events of September 1992. So, a more accurate - if rather less snappy - soundbite would be that it's usually the economy, stupid. Governments lose elections in the aftermath of big economic catastrophes - the devaluation of 1967 and the sterling crisis of 1976 were followed by Labour defeats - and oppositions find it hard to win when life is sweet, as in 1959 and 1987. Unless something goes seriously wrong for Mr Blair in the next couple of months, the portents are good.

On a chill winter's afternoon, Rachel Weisz provides a mini masterclass: the door to her London hotel suite swings open and in walks Weisz (you pronounce it \"Vice\") wearing naught but jeans, sports bra and an abundance of black eye-liner. The actress, it transpires, has just completed a photoshoot and wants to make a private call. Mundanity replaces the sheen of celebrity. Later Weisz insists: \"I'm not a celebrity, I'm an actor.\" There were times when the world must have wondered. </p> <p>In career terms, Weisz has led a fairytale existence. Born to a creative, middle-class family of Hungarian emigres (mum a therapist, dad an inventor), she began modelling aged 13, turned down a role in Richard Gere's King David at 14, and took her own theatre company to the Edinburgh festival after graduating from Cambridge. </p> <p>She made her film debut as an \"evil sexy bitch\" in Bernardo Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty, smouldered darkly as the object of desire in Michael Winterbottom's I Want You (\"my favourite piece of work\") and popped up as the intrepid librarian in the hit comic-book horror romp The Mummy. In the meantime - running as a gaudy sideshow - went all the other stuff. In the past five years, Weisz's raven-headed good looks have made her a darling of the glossies, while a series of famous boyfriends (Sam Mendes and Neil Morrissey among them) guaranteed her a high-profile slot on the showbiz circuit. But for a few different turns, she might be in Liz Hurley-land by now. </p> <p>Weisz has taxied from her London flat to promote Beautiful Creatures, an offbeat (and ultimately off-target) comedy thriller in which she stars as Petula, a brutalised trophy girlfriend turned wised-up agent of vengeance. Weisz plays Petula as a kind of social-realist Marilyn Monroe, a peroxide bombshell tottering precariously in high heels and arse-hugging skirts. \"Petula is almost like the mythical blonde,\" she points out. \"Technically, she was a real challenge to play.\" </p> <p>On screen, Weisz can exude an exaggerated, vampish beauty. In person she's smaller, slighter than you'd expect, as though her image were the result of some chemical reaction between her face and the movie camera. Weisz maintains that she is never recognised in public and this is how she likes it. \"James Dean or Elvis were celebrities, but it's so not a part of my life. People want to imagine I spend every night going to premieres and putting on frocks and getting into limos, and yet I do that maybe twice a year, if that. I think you have a choice, actually, and I've chosen to stay on the outskirts of that world.\" </p> <p>Still, there have been times when she looked in danger of being sucked in - particularly when her relationship with Morrissey, the Men Behaving Badly star, dragged her briefly into the tabloids' orbit. Weisz shrugs: \"Yes, Neil had embraced tabloid culture, if you can call it that. He was quite comfortable with it all.\" Not her? \"No. I didn't like it at all.\" </p> <p>Some actors play the shy-and- retiring card with a phoney flourish; others with genuine heart. With Weisz it seems more complicated than that. Previous interviewers have speculated that her career has been typified by a constant struggle to reconcile conflicting parental influences. On the one hand, they claim, Weisz is governed by her mother, who nudged her into modelling and lobbied hard for her to take the role in King David. On the other, she's intent on impressing her sterner, more purist father (\"a really harsh critic - he didn't think I should be acting, because he thought I wasn't good enough\"). </p> <p>Weisz is resistant to such amateur head-shrinking. Even so, she admits to feeling a strong degree of ambi-valence about her gilded career. \"It makes me uncomfortable,\" she says. \"But I think I have a natural inclination towards guilt.\" </p> <p>What does she feel guilty about? She draws on her cigarette and pauses for the longest time. \"Sometimes, it all feels a bit too much that everything just seems to work out,\" she says quietly. \"That you're attractive and successful and you've got a good education, and that journalists want to ask you all about it. I'm not confident around compliments or being celebrated, and I'm not comfortable with the thought of envy, which some people thrive on. Some people like having eyes upon them and I don't.\" She gives an apologetic half-smile: \"I know that sounds odd, because I'm an actor. But an actor is about being somebody else.\" </p> <p>That said, her chameleon stance stops short of complete reinvention. In setting out on her chosen career, Weisz made one minor but crucial statement by hanging on to her surname. If not unique, she is certainly rare among Jewish actresses for not trying to \"Waspify\" her identity. Weisz says that this only occurred to her recently. The more she thinks about it, the more interesting the whole thing becomes. \"You have to wonder: would Winona Ryder be Winona Ryder if she was still called Nonni Horowitz? Or Lauren Bacall if she was Betty Perske? I don't know. What do you think? Does Weisz sound very Jewish?\" </p> <p>Well, yeah. She considers this for a bit. \"Actually, I did want to change my name when I started acting, but only because I got so bored of people mispronouncing it as 'Wheeze' or 'Wize'. I wanted to change the spelling to 'Vyce'. I couldn't do 'Vice' or I would have sounded like a porn star. But my agent at the time wouldn't have it. He said, 'It looks like a fucking number plate! You are not changing your fucking name.' But he's Jewish, so maybe that's why he did it.\" In the event, the decision worked out fine: \"I haven't only been offered Hasidic roles.\" </p> <p>In the past 18 months, Weisz has starred in Beautiful Creatures, filmed the sequel to The Mummy, played Ralph Fiennes's adulterous love interest in Istvan Szabo's undervalued family saga Sunshine and co-starred opposite Fiennes Jr (Joseph) in the Stalingrad siege drama Enemy at the Gates. She also found time to appear on stage in an acclaimed production of Tennessee Williams's Suddenly Last Summer. It was, she says, the first time her father complimented her on a performance. </p> <p>In March, she'll turn 30. \"Your 20s,\" she sighs, \"are a very difficult time.\" Mention that her 20s have seemed peculiarly blessed, and Weisz responds with an indulgent smile. \"Ah, but you're talking about my career and I'm talking about my life. No - my 20s were horrible. I felt I didn't know anything. I was petrified and insecure and worried about everything. I think that as you get older you learn to let go of a few things.

An announcement confirming the move, which follows weeks of negotiation, is expected shortly. His departure will be a major blow to the BBC as he was seen as one of the best creative talents at executive level Mr Young, 32, who was regarded as a rising star within BBC entertainment, has been lured back to the world of independent production with the potentially lucrative role in a new joint venture with Hat Trick. And he will be taking Mike Beale, another senior BBC light entertainment executive with him. Mr Beale will be his deputy at the joint venture. Hat Trick, the indie producer behind shows including Have I Got News for You and Father Ted, first approached the BBC entertainment executive more than a month ago with a job offer. His package is expected to top \u00a3200,000 in a deal improving on his already lucrative BBC contract. At the corporation he earned in the region of \u00a3150,000 but his take home pay was bigger because of a deal he cut with the corporation on arrival guaranteeing him a fee for any new formats he generated. In just over 18 months at BBC entertainment, Mr Young is regarded as having injected new life into the corporation's light entertainment portfolio. He brought in young people with no TV experience to help generate imaginative new formats and launched hit shows including The Weakest Link and Friends Like These. And unlike most BBC executives he was not afraid to court controversy and on one occasion announced a format which led to accusations that the corporation was teaching people how to rob banks. Just shortly after arrival, he declared he was going to revive the beeb's entertainment fortunes. At the time it was suffering severely in the ratings and there was despair as executives tried to find something to replace the axed Noel's House Party. He introduced a young talent scheme and frequently proclaimed how he had broken down barriers at the BBC by encouraging departments which had previously not worked with each other to come up with news formats. The Weakest Link, for instance, was originally developed for daytime TV. Mr Young has worked at Hat Trick before, devising the Whatever You Want format. He left in 1997 and later worked at Bazal before being poached by the BBC.",

      "byline": "Joshua Micah Marshall, Slate",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Hillary Clinton in 2004? Why not? Empire State governors and senators are perpetual contenders for the White House, and the first lady already commands a national following and deep support among Democratic activists. Think of all those chits she can call in from elected officials and operatives. She also comes to the table with the fund-raising Rolodex that made her husband the biggest harvester of campaign cash in American history. And she's a winner.</p> <p>When you add up the first lady's advantages it's understandable why the right-wing media (Robert Novak) and the mainstream media (Sam Donaldson) are making the question of resurgent (Hillary) Clintonism such a topic of speculation.</p> <p>Understandable, that is, if you ignore the gazillion reasons why the idea of Hillary Clinton running for president is ridiculous.</p> <p>To understand the outlandishness of this idea, consider the New York Senate race results. Hillary Clinton won her seat with 55 percent of the vote. But the margin of victory is less revealing than the way she came by it. Her campaign polarized the electorate between those who really, really wanted Hillary and those who really, really didn't want her. That intensity of commitment on both sides allowed the relative-unknown Rick Lazio to bounce into the low- to mid-40s in the polls within days of entering the race. In the end it was the Hillary people versus the anti-Hillary people. But few states have as many Hillary people as New York.</p> <p>This is all a way of saying that the first lady is a very divisive figure. Presidents can leave office as exceedingly divisive figures, but successful ones seldom enter the game that way. And that's just the start of Sen. Clinton's problems. She probably couldn't win a single state that Al Gore lost in this election.</p> <p>Here's why.</p> <p>Gore won virtually all the Northeast, all the West Coast, and nearly all the Industrial Midwest, but failed to win any other state except New Mexico.

      "bodyText": "Hillary Clinton in 2004? Why not? Empire State governors and senators are perpetual contenders for the White House, and the first lady already commands a national following and deep support among Democratic activists. Think of all those chits she can call in from elected officials and operatives. She also comes to the table with the fund-raising Rolodex that made her husband the biggest harvester of campaign cash in American history. And she's a winner. When you add up the first lady's advantages it's understandable why the right-wing media (Robert Novak) and the mainstream media (Sam Donaldson) are making the question of resurgent (Hillary) Clintonism such a topic of speculation. Understandable, that is, if you ignore the gazillion reasons why the idea of Hillary Clinton running for president is ridiculous. To understand the outlandishness of this idea, consider the New York Senate race results. Hillary Clinton won her seat with 55 percent of the vote. But the margin of victory is less revealing than the way she came by it. Her campaign polarized the electorate between those who really, really wanted Hillary and those who really, really didn't want her. That intensity of commitment on both sides allowed the relative-unknown Rick Lazio to bounce into the low- to mid-40s in the polls within days of entering the race. In the end it was the Hillary people versus the anti-Hillary people. But few states have as many Hillary people as New York. This is all a way of saying that the first lady is a very divisive figure. Presidents can leave office as exceedingly divisive figures, but successful ones seldom enter the game that way. And that's just the start of Sen. Clinton's problems. She probably couldn't win a single state that Al Gore lost in this election. Here's why. Gore won virtually all the Northeast, all the West Coast, and nearly all the Industrial Midwest, but failed to win any other state except New Mexico. What did him in in the rest of the country was cultural liberalism\u0084support for gun control, abortion rights, and gay rights. This handicap was particularly evident in Appalachia\u0084West Virginia, Tennessee, western Pennsylvania, and southeastern Ohio. And who is more identified with cultural liberalism, Al Gore or Hillary Clinton? Or frame the issue this way: A pressing problem for Democrats is their dwindling support among white men. Given the party's mounting majorities among women and minorities, the fact that Republicans consistently win majorities of the white male vote is neither surprising nor even that troubling. But Democrats can't afford to lose them in quite the numbers they have of late. George W. Bush beat Gore by almost 2-to-1 among white males (60 percent to 36 percent).

      "body": "<p>Instead of getting meat cooking on the fire, which was my great desire, I got a war. I never saw one before, no, but I heard stories from Tartoyen, while some things you do understand even without knowing. This was no battle yet, but nearly, with mine on one side and Roingin on other. That was a mystery to confound, yes, as Roingin never could be here, in the world, but must stay in theirs, as everybody knew. Also they weren't enough. Roingin were famous for being many but now they were fewer than mine. Still I could see they were strong, as they had more spears. Tartoyen, Gonar and others of mine just had a few - some didn't have even one - while Roingin had two or three each. That was some grievous worry, yes, and I did ponder how mine could be so piss-poor foolish.<br> \"You are cowards,\" sang Roingin, to make my ones fearful, \"and we will kill you very soon.\" \"You are liars and cheats,\" mine sang back, \"and today you will die.\" This war was a slow thing, I did observe, and shaking spears and singing insults went on and on with no fighting, so I went round through the bushes to where Grandmother and other women of my ones were standing. Grandmother was rejoicing to see me, though she was cross too. Grandmother never could just be pleased. \"Peevay, where've you been?\" she asked. \"We looked everywhere for you.\" That was pleasing. So they were sorry, I did divine. I asked her how this war happened, and she said it started the morning before, when they met Roingin just walking through the forest of the world - our world - as if it was their place and not ours at all. That was a fighting thing, of course, as it is a strongest law that everybody must stay in their place unless they are allowed. \"There nearly was a war then,\" said Grandmother, telling how they all got ready, spears pointing and so, but then Roingin asked to speak their story. Gonar said they must not, but Tartoyen never did love fighting much, so he did permit them. Roingin story was too woeful. Ghosts came to their land, they told, plenty of them, and with ghost animals too, that were small and stupid and coloured like snow. First these ghosts were friendly, but then they tried to steal Roingin women and fighting happened, just small. One day when Roingin were looking for seal to hunt, ghosts came suddenly with sticks with thunder noise, and killed everyone they could, half all Roingin, children and everyone, and threw them into the sea. Later Roingin killed some back, but now ghosts were too many, always more, and when ghosts came to hunt them, Roingin decided they must leave their own land or all get killed. That was some ruination, truly, as to leave your world was just impossible, like being dead. Or so I supposed then. Gonar wanted to kill Roingin anyway, despite their story, but Tartoyen felt sad for them. So he said ours would not kill them after all if they went away to their land now and never came back. They agreed, yes, and looked as if they went, but then when my ones woke this morning they found spears were gone, except just a few, and they saw Roingin watching through the trees, and shouting to Tartoyen he must let them stay in the world after all. Tartoyen couldn't do that of course. In fact he was more wrathful than everyone now, even than Gonar, as Roingins' grievous betraying made him look just foolishness. So everybody got ready to fight. \"Go back to your world,\" my ones were chanting. \"Go back to your world or you all will die.\" Each side had one fighter who wanted to make the war start. Ours was Gonar, while Roingin's was a short one with killing eyes. Each would run forward bravely towards enemies by and by, to wave his spear in the air and start new chanting, but then he'd look back at the rest of his to divine if they were following, and they never were. So it was, once and again, and I don't know if it ever could start, no, except for that accident. This was quite funny at first. Their warrior made another grievous provocation, waving his spear and so, and when his others never came, again he went away, walking backwards so he could watch my ones still. It was this going backwards that was his ruination, as he never saw that root stuck in the ground, but just fell. Some of mine laughed, I do recollect, and I laughed too, but not Gonar. He was gleeful at this great good fortune and ran forward fast, throwing his spear like wind, straight into Roingin warrior, making a little tiny cutting sound, <em>chhhh.</em> That was a good wound he got, I did divine, in his belly, enough for any wallaby, and though he shouted and tried to get up he could not.<br> Other Roingin were angry now, of course, and ran forward at Gonar, who got two spears both together, one in his neck. This was woeful and caused tender feelings deep inside my breast, yes, as it was lamentable to see him speared thus. Now everyone was shouting and holding spears as if they might throw them, or stooping down behind some tree, and suddenly I feared this might be some terrible war, everyone dead, though I never heard of any such before. That was when the noise came. Truly, I never heard anything like it ever before. Louder than thunder it went, but very sudden, so I hardly knew it when it was already finished, and my ears were humming like wind in rocks, as if I got hit by some grievous blow. For one moment I wondered if this was the sound of being dead and if I was a ghost now, but then I observed others were still alive, and looking surprised just Iike me. Then I saw the strangers. I think they were there before, yes, and I never noticed because of the fighting. They were standing away by the trees, not many - fewer even than Roingin - but looking strong. At the front was a woman with a face that was hard like stone, and in her hand she held a strange stick, that was long as a spear but thick like some waddy, with a thin end, all beautiful and shining. I could see smoke coming from it, though it wasn't burning, which was interesting, and made me think it was some magic thing. It was this woman who shouted at us. \"I won't let you fight each other. You must fight for me.\" War was finished now, of course, stopped by everyone getting so surprised. Some ran away into trees, others just stood and stared. Then again it was some great mystery to confound. You see, this woman, who I never saw till now, spoke my ones' language. Another puzzle to confound was that Grandmother was crying. Grandmother never cried. \"Who is she?\" I asked. Grandmother looked at me, and for the first time that I ever could recollect I observed there was no hating in her eyes. \"Your mother.\" So I finally saw her. She never was tall and beautiful like I thought, no, but was quite short with strong arms and legs, and quick eyes ready for some fight. Still I never minded. This was blissful and great good fortune. This was jubilation and tidings of joy. She had come to find me after all. I did not wait but ran, past mine, past Roingin, even past strange animals that I never saw before, that looked like kanunnah but small, and were called DOG ANIMALS, so I learned after. She never saw me till I was close. Then I grabbed her leg and shouted, \"Mother.\" Thus I got my worst grievous blow. Her eyes, which were gleeful before, turned cold like winter sea. Then she pushed me off, hard so my arms hurt, and turned away. Where she walked was interesting, yes. She went over to one boy, smaller than me, with little thin legs so he looked good for hitting, and d'you know she took the heinous little shit in her arms, as if he was some finest wondrous thing. So it was I first saw Tayaleah, my never-guessed scut of a brother. <strong>Captain Illiam Quillian Kewley<br> JULY 1857</strong><br> After three full weeks caught in that sealed dock like rats in a box, why, even the river Blackwater seemed paradise itself. It's the Blackwater that leads up to Maldon town, and a well-named stream it is too, as if it's mud you're looking for then this is just the spot for you. All that eastern shore of your England is mudflat land, being nothing more than a great nothing of wind, yelling birds and too much sky. And mud, of course. But after that London every last dirty scran of it seemed loveliness itself. As the wise man says, though, <em>for every summer Sunday there's a winter wind to pay,</em> and in this case the cost of our freedom was plain for all to see, strutting about the ship as if they owned it. Total charge: three passengers. Worse, Englishmen all of them. I can't say I was happy about the arrangement. I dare say I'd expected the <em>Sincerity</em> to see a few humiliations in her time - to be nibbled by barnacles, shat on by gulls and poked and prodded by customs men - but never, not once, did I think she'd be reduced to the shame of passengers.<br> Strange articles of passengers they were, too. Truly, you never did see such a clever and pestful trio as these, all disagreeing with themselves and taking their great clever brains for a little stroll about the deck. I dare say it was hardly a surprise they were odds, mind, seeing as their quest was to discover themselves the Garden of Eden. The Garden of Eden! As if it couldn't just be left in the Bible where it belonged. They weren't even looking to find it in any sensible spot, but on some rotten island at the very ends of the earth, called Van Diemen's Land, or Tasmania, as it couldn't make up its mind. This was a mad fool of a place, by the sounds Of it, all gaols and bluemen and worse, being nowhere any sensible fellow would venture near. It was there, and all the way back, too, that we were supposed to be carrying the three snots. A whole year of Englishmen. What a thought that was. It was bad enough just taking them along the coast to Maldon. Worst was mealtimes, when I had to suffer them in the dining cabin with all their genteel little smirks and thank-yous and <em>I wonder if you could pass the salt, Captain?</em> The hardest to take was that vicar, Reverend Wilson, who was a thin, twittering sort of body, with a toothy smile that sat on his face all the time, like he never tired of himself. Truly, you never met a body so rich in his own importance, and watching him smirk and chew at his dinner it was hard not to think what a surprise he'd give to the fishes if he accidentally got dropped over the side. He was mean as could be, too. Truly, I don't think we could've found a more suspecting and penny-counting scrape if we'd trawled all London especially. It was all I could manage to coax enough charter money out of him to pay the customs fine, and even then he insisted on following me round the provision shops and such, peering over my shoulders as if I couldn't be trusted. Was that really enough casks of water for a journey to Australia? Enough biscuit? Enough chickens and sheep? In the end I had no choice but to stock up with half a shipload of food and water and creatures that we didn't want, quite as if we really did intend to take them to the ends of the earth. All the while we were loading up their own stores which were fancy as could be - champagne and best French brandy, choice meats and even silver cutlery to eat it all with - so we knew that, for all his moaning, this vicar was rich as the man that turned the rabbits all to gold.<br> Hardly a day seemed to go by without him calling at the sealed dock with some new fussing. He squawked so loud about sleeping quarters that I was sure he was after my own cabin. I was tempted to clear out Chalse Christian's carpentry workshop and fling them in there, but I supposed we'd never catch a penny out of them with that, so in the end it was the mates' cabins they had. I had Chalse Christian the carpenter rig up a top bunk in Brew's haunt, which would now be graced by Reverend Wilson and Dr. Potter. Second mate Kinvig's cabin, being nothing more than a cupboard with a porthole, I gave to the plants boy, Renshaw. Even then they were all three of them moaning and complaining, saying they wanted something more genteel, as if this was some passenger steamer. Nor were they the only ones playing huffy, as Brew and Kinvig were in a proper scowl at being slung into the fo'c'sle with the boys. Never you mind, I told them in Manx, it's only till we get to Maldon. Finally there came that welcome morning when we were to be gone from the London dock. I'd have been happy slipping away nice and quiet, for sure, as in my book it's never clever to go catching the world's stares, but sadly that wasn't our Englishmen's way, and quite a crowd turned up to wave them good riddance. There were parsons, and newspapermen looking sharp. There was Jonah Childs, the moneybags, who had signed the charter agreement and given us our jink. A funny-looking body he was, tall as trees with a little tiny head so he looked like a bottle stuck on a pole, as he went round playing the big man, letting everyone have a little shake of his hand. Then there were the Reverend's children - a great stringy pack of them - and his wife and her sister too, who were a proper pair of wallopers, smiling away as if they couldn't wait for the old sleetch to be gone. Not that I blamed them any for that. Renshaw, the little plants boy, did hardly better, as his brother and father looked cheery as tombstones, while his mother was too far the other way, sobbing and fussing and pulling out a little present that she pretended she'd forgot, \"for those cold nights in the mountains,\" though this turned out to be a dainty pair of gloves just right for supping tea with the Queen. It was the surgeon of the three, Potter, who did best with his goodbyes, catching himself half a hospital's worth of doctors, all making little speeches to one another at how grand it was he was going. They'd have a surprise when he came back inside a week. Finally the ropes were let go, the boats hauled us out of the sealed port and a tug towed us down the river and away to the estuary. Grand as it felt to have the <em>Sincerity</em> back to a bit of ocean, it was rotten hard having those Englishmen aboard, all snooping and curious and noticing things. My fright was they might notice too much. The other little bother I had - and which I'd hardly troubled myself with till then, as there'd always been something worse to worry me - was how on earth we were going to unload that certain special cargo without catching their notice. Shifting casks of brandy by the dozen, along with sheaves of tobacco and some interesting pieces of French glass, will tend to cause a bit of fuss and noise, after all. It would have to be done somehow, though, as we couldn't give them back their charter money till we'd sold up.<br> \"Perhaps we should just drop all three of them over the side,\" suggested Brew, smooth as milk. Sometimes I hardly knew if that one was joking. </p>",

It was all I could manage to coax enough charter money out of him to pay the customs fine, and even then he insisted on following me round the provision shops and such, peering over my shoulders as if I couldn't be trusted. Was that really enough casks of water for a journey to Australia? Enough biscuit? Enough chickens and sheep? In the end I had no choice but to stock up with half a shipload of food and water and creatures that we didn't want, quite as if we really did intend to take them to the ends of the earth. All the while we were loading up their own stores which were fancy as could be - champagne and best French brandy, choice meats and even silver cutlery to eat it all with - so we knew that, for all his moaning, this vicar was rich as the man that turned the rabbits all to gold. Hardly a day seemed to go by without him calling at the sealed dock with some new fussing. He squawked so loud about sleeping quarters that I was sure he was after my own cabin. I was tempted to clear out Chalse Christian's carpentry workshop and fling them in there, but I supposed we'd never catch a penny out of them with that, so in the end it was the mates' cabins they had. I had Chalse Christian the carpenter rig up a top bunk in Brew's haunt, which would now be graced by Reverend Wilson and Dr. Potter. Second mate Kinvig's cabin, being nothing more than a cupboard with a porthole, I gave to the plants boy, Renshaw. Even then they were all three of them moaning and complaining, saying they wanted something more genteel, as if this was some passenger steamer. Nor were they the only ones playing huffy, as Brew and Kinvig were in a proper scowl at being slung into the fo'c'sle with the boys. Never you mind, I told them in Manx, it's only till we get to Maldon. Finally there came that welcome morning when we were to be gone from the London dock. I'd have been happy slipping away nice and quiet, for sure, as in my book it's never clever to go catching the world's stares, but sadly that wasn't our Englishmen's way, and quite a crowd turned up to wave them good riddance. There were parsons, and newspapermen looking sharp. There was Jonah Childs, the moneybags, who had signed the charter agreement and given us our jink. A funny-looking body he was, tall as trees with a little tiny head so he looked like a bottle stuck on a pole, as he went round playing the big man, letting everyone have a little shake of his hand. Then there were the Reverend's children - a great stringy pack of them - and his wife and her sister too, who were a proper pair of wallopers, smiling away as if they couldn't wait for the old sleetch to be gone. Not that I blamed them any for that. Renshaw, the little plants boy, did hardly better, as his brother and father looked cheery as tombstones, while his mother was too far the other way, sobbing and fussing and pulling out a little present that she pretended she'd forgot, \"for those cold nights in the mountains,\" though this turned out to be a dainty pair of gloves just right for supping tea with the Queen. It was the surgeon of the three, Potter, who did best with his goodbyes, catching himself half a hospital's worth of doctors, all making little speeches to one another at how grand it was he was going. They'd have a surprise when he came back inside a week. Finally the ropes were let go, the boats hauled us out of the sealed port and a tug towed us down the river and away to the estuary. Grand as it felt to have the Sincerity back to a bit of ocean, it was rotten hard having those Englishmen aboard, all snooping and curious and noticing things. My fright was they might notice too much. The other little bother I had - and which I'd hardly troubled myself with till then, as there'd always been something worse to worry me - was how on earth we were going to unload that certain special cargo without catching their notice. Shifting casks of brandy by the dozen, along with sheaves of tobacco and some interesting pieces of French glass, will tend to cause a bit of fuss and noise, after all. It would have to be done somehow, though, as we couldn't give them back their charter money till we'd sold up. \"Perhaps we should just drop all three of them over the side,\" suggested Brew, smooth as milk. Sometimes I hardly knew if that one was joking.",

      "body": "<p>The killers of two-year-old James Bulger won an unprecedented court order yesterday granting them anonymity for the rest of their lives when they leave custody with new identities. </p> <p>Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, England's most senior family judge, granted the order - described by Desmond Browne, QC for the newspapers that opposed it, as \"a historic first\" - to protect Robert Thompson and Jon Venables from possible revenge attacks by James Bulger's relatives and the public. </p> <p>The order, the first granted to protect the identity of an adult, bans the media from disclosing information about the new identities, addresses, appearance, and even the accents of the pair, who are expected to be freed within months. </p> <p>In addition, no information may be published for 12 months about the eight years they have spent in local authority secure units in the north of England, including their rehabilitation and educational regimes. </p> <p>The pair, now 18, were aged 10 in February 1993 when they battered the two-year-old to death and left him on a Liverpool railway line. </p> <p>They are expected to be released soon after a ruling last October by Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, that they had served the minimum term necessary for punishment and deterrence. They are likely to set up home somewhere in the north of England with new identities provided by the Home Office. </p> <p>Their application for permanent injunctions protecting their new identities was opposed by News Group, Associated Newspapers and the Mirror Group. </p> <p>Only Mary Bell, who killed two small boys in 1968 when she was 12, has had the benefit of such a wide-ranging injunction.

      "bodyText": "The killers of two-year-old James Bulger won an unprecedented court order yesterday granting them anonymity for the rest of their lives when they leave custody with new identities. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, England's most senior family judge, granted the order - described by Desmond Browne, QC for the newspapers that opposed it, as \"a historic first\" - to protect Robert Thompson and Jon Venables from possible revenge attacks by James Bulger's relatives and the public. The order, the first granted to protect the identity of an adult, bans the media from disclosing information about the new identities, addresses, appearance, and even the accents of the pair, who are expected to be freed within months. In addition, no information may be published for 12 months about the eight years they have spent in local authority secure units in the north of England, including their rehabilitation and educational regimes. The pair, now 18, were aged 10 in February 1993 when they battered the two-year-old to death and left him on a Liverpool railway line. They are expected to be released soon after a ruling last October by Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, that they had served the minimum term necessary for punishment and deterrence. They are likely to set up home somewhere in the north of England with new identities provided by the Home Office. Their application for permanent injunctions protecting their new identities was opposed by News Group, Associated Newspapers and the Mirror Group. Only Mary Bell, who killed two small boys in 1968 when she was 12, has had the benefit of such a wide-ranging injunction. But in her case, the order was granted to protect not her but her daughter, who was under 18 and a ward of court. There was no power at the time to grant anonymity to an adult. But Dame Elizabeth, president of the high court's family division, ruled yesterday that the new Human Rights Act, with its duty on the state to protect the right to life, gave the court jurisdiction to make such an order for the first time. She quoted a wide selection of inflammatory press reports, including a statement by James Bulger's father, Ralph, that he would \"hunt down\" his son's killers once they were released. These, together with Home Office evidence and other information, \"convinced me that these young men are uniquely notorious and are at serious risk of attacks from members of the public as well as from relatives and friends of the murdered child,\" she said. \"In the exceptional circumstances of this case and applying English domestic law and the right to life enshrined in article 2 of the European convention, I have come to the conclusion that I am compelled to take steps in the almost unique circumstances of this case to protect their lives and physical well-being.\" The injunction does not apply to newspapers in Scotland or abroad and does not prevent publication on non-media websites. But the media in England and Wales will not be able to publish just because the information is in the public domain through the internet or a foreign newspaper. Dame Elizabeth granted the newspapers leave to appeal, adding: \"It seems to be entirely right if I've given a judgment which to say the least is unusual, the court of appeal should be entitled to review it and tell me whether I'm right or wrong.\" Denise Fergus, James's mother, said in a statement: \"They simply don't deserve it.

      "body": "<p>We've all been there, and if you haven't your girlfriend has. The doctor's appointment shoehorned into a day that's already too busy. Minutes slipping past in the waiting room as you struggle to come up with a plausible explanation for why (and how, exactly) you've had unprotected sex. </p> <p>Now, however, emergency hormonal contraceptives are to be available, not just on prescription from doctors' surgeries, family planning clinics and selected accident and emergency centres, but also over-the-counter at a chemist's. </p> <p>Levonelle (the so-called morning-after pill) was removed from prescription-only control on January 1. Only then were Schering, its makers, free to start supplying the drug to the high street, with the result that while some pharmacies might receive stock as early as this week most of Britain's 15,000 chemists are not guaranteed delivery until January 30. </p> <p>Those pharmacists who choose on moral or religious grounds not to sell it will be obliged to carry information about the nearest stockists. Boots say that all their pharmaceutical stores will carry supplies. Levonelle is not going to be difficult to find. </p> <p>This has medical as well as convenience benefits. For while these pills can be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, they are known to be more effective if taken sooner rather than later. (Levonelle is believed to prevent 95% of expected pregnancies if taken within 24 hours but only 58% if taken within 48-72 hours). </p> <p>So no appointments, no waiting rooms, no uncomfortable questions? Almost. A slim little box containing two progestogen pills (to be taken 12 hours apart) is still not going to be as simple a purchase as suntan cream. There will be no slipping it quietly into your basket - you'll have to ask for it (tip: rather than make a foghorn decree of your nocturnal activities by demanding the \"morning-after pill\" try keeping icy composure and simply ask for Levonelle). And your boyfriend probably won't be able to buy it on your behalf either. </p> <p>Before they sell the drug pharmacists are required by their professional body, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS), to obtain certain information from buyers. Expect a quick chat that ought to cover the following points. </p> <p>First, pharmacists are supposed to satisfy themselves that their customer is 16 or over. Whether they go so far as to ask for proof of age is discretionary. They will also want to know that the pill is for you: RPS guidelines state that only in exceptional circumstances should Levonelle be sold to someone other than the patient. </p> <p>The pharmacist will then seek to establish that you do need to take the pill; in other words, that you have had unprotected sex within the last 72 hours. Women ought to remember that they are not required to provide either details or excuses (although the pharmacist may make suggestions about suitable contraceptives); simply state the facts. </p> <p>They will want to know if you could already be pregnant, in which case there would be no point selling this pill (though Levonelle does not appear to harm the baby if you do take it while already pregnant). So expect to be asked: Is your period late? If so, how late? Was the last one lighter or shorter than normal or unusual in any other way? Since the last one has there been unprotected sex at any time before this occasion? </p> <p>The pharmacist ought also to check that you are not taking any medicine that might interfere with Levonelle and that you have no problems (such as vomiting or severe diarrhoea) that might affect its absorption. Finally, you will be asked if you are aware of having an allergy to levonorgestrel, the ingredient in Levonelle, or if you have a severe liver complaint, in which case this drug is not recommended. </p> <p>Once you've got through that you'll have to pay \u00a319.99 (significantly more than the standard prescription charge of \u00a36.00 you'd pay after a visit to the doctor). With Levonelle, doctors say you don't have to worry about the side- effects - nausea and vomiting - notoriously associated with its predecessor \"morning-after pill\" the PC4. </p> <p>A very small incidence of nausea and very occasional vomiting has been reported, says Professor Peter Bowen Simpkins, treasurer of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. \"But the recommendation is that it is taken with food and the incidence then is much reduced.\" </p> <p>Levonelle is a progestogen-only pill. (Progestogen is a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone; PC4 contains progestogen and oestrogen). It's fine to take it if you miss your ordinary contraceptive pill. But it's worth remembering that the most dangerous time to miss a pill is not around day 13 (the most fertile point in the cycle), when you are substantially protected by the 10 or so pills already taken, but at the beginning of the packet, by elongating the pill-free week. </p> <p>It is not related to the so-called abortion-pill, an anti-progesterone that induces menstruation and is only licensed in this country as a medical form of termination of pregnancy. Instead, Levonelle works in three ways. First, it stops or delays the ovaries from releasing an egg. Second, it prevents the sperm from fertilising an egg that might have been released. And third, \"and this is the bone of contention,\" says Professor Bowen-Simpkins, \"it may interfere with implantation of the egg in the womb\". This is why some say taking Levonelle is tantamount to having a very early abortion. </p> <p>Is there a level of usage at which, from a health point of view, worry might set in? </p> <p>Professor Bowen-Simpkins says not that he knows of, \"except for more than once a cycle because then you may get chaotic menstruation. The point is that we would be failing a patient who needed to take it so often by not giving them reliable contraception. After all, Levonelle is not 100% successful. It should only be seen as a back-up.\" </p> <p>One grey area remains: whether emergency contraceptives can be stashed away in advance without resorting to telling fibs to a pharmacist. The RPS advises its members that supply in advance of need is not currently recommended and instructs them only to offer clients advice on where such a service is provided locally. </p> <p>In fact, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) has been providing women with advance supplies of emergency hormonal contraception - first PC4, now Levonelle - for about 18 months for about \u00a315 (which includes a consultation with a doctor) a go. </p> <p>So perhaps the morning-after pill bought at the chemist the night before is not so very far away.</p> <p><strong>Four women describe their morning-after pill experience </strong> <strong> Ellen Davis, 29</strong> </p> <p> Ellen had been on the pill for eight years when she decided to give her body a break. \"We started using condoms, and one night one split. It was a Friday, the worst possible time. I knew about the morning-after pill, but I had no idea how to get hold of it outside surgery hours.\" She and her boyfriend got up at the crack of dawn on Saturday, phoned various friends, then headed for a clinic in Notting Hill, west London. \"I was given a lot of literature about contraception, which did make me laugh. I mean, I'd been on the pill for so many years, I thought I knew what was what, and they were treating me like a teenager.\" </p> <p> <strong> Lynne Robinson, 44</strong> </p> <p> Lynne split up with husband when their daughter was four and since then she hasn't had a long term relationship. \"Contraception was a totally dead issue as far as I was concerned.\" But in December she had a one-night-stand with a former colleague: they were drunk and had unprotected sex. The following morning, Lynne was in shock. She went to her doctor. Arriving at the surgery, she felt as if the practice nurse was treating her like a naughty schoolgirl. \"Things got worse after I took the first pair of tablets. I threw up after an hour - well I was feeling a bit ropey with all the booze. I had to go back and get more pills.\" </p> <p> <strong> Jane Summerton, 18</strong> </p> <p> Jane had been seeing her boyfriend Mark for more than a year before they had sex. \"We hadn't discussed contraception, I know that's probably a bit dim. On the night, we were so drunk that we didn't really know what we were doing. In the event, Mark produced a condom, but it came off. She went to her GP. \"I felt covered with shame. I got a long lecture from the doctor about methods of contraception and safe sex. When I walked out of there clutching a fistful of condoms, I was in tears. Physically I felt dreadful too: the pills made me feel dizzy and drowsy, and I stayed in bed for two whole days afterwards.\" </p> <p> <strong> Heather Ross, 37</strong> </p> <p> \"My husband wants children, but until recently I was unsure. We'd had a bit to drink - maybe that's why I began to be swayed by his point of view. That night I left my diaphragm in the bathroom cabinet.\" She went to work the next day as normal but by lunchtime she was seized with panic. \"Suddenly I knew that I'd made a terrible mistake.\" She went to get the morning-after pill during her lunch hour. \"The pills gave me a chronic headache, and my breasts felt sore and swollen. But when my period came, I felt it had all been worth it.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Some names have been changed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We've all been there, and if you haven't your girlfriend has. The doctor's appointment shoehorned into a day that's already too busy. Minutes slipping past in the waiting room as you struggle to come up with a plausible explanation for why (and how, exactly) you've had unprotected sex. Now, however, emergency hormonal contraceptives are to be available, not just on prescription from doctors' surgeries, family planning clinics and selected accident and emergency centres, but also over-the-counter at a chemist's. Levonelle (the so-called morning-after pill) was removed from prescription-only control on January 1. Only then were Schering, its makers, free to start supplying the drug to the high street, with the result that while some pharmacies might receive stock as early as this week most of Britain's 15,000 chemists are not guaranteed delivery until January 30. Those pharmacists who choose on moral or religious grounds not to sell it will be obliged to carry information about the nearest stockists. Boots say that all their pharmaceutical stores will carry supplies. Levonelle is not going to be difficult to find. This has medical as well as convenience benefits. For while these pills can be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, they are known to be more effective if taken sooner rather than later. (Levonelle is believed to prevent 95% of expected pregnancies if taken within 24 hours but only 58% if taken within 48-72 hours). So no appointments, no waiting rooms, no uncomfortable questions? Almost. A slim little box containing two progestogen pills (to be taken 12 hours apart) is still not going to be as simple a purchase as suntan cream. There will be no slipping it quietly into your basket - you'll have to ask for it (tip: rather than make a foghorn decree of your nocturnal activities by demanding the \"morning-after pill\" try keeping icy composure and simply ask for Levonelle). And your boyfriend probably won't be able to buy it on your behalf either. Before they sell the drug pharmacists are required by their professional body, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS), to obtain certain information from buyers. Expect a quick chat that ought to cover the following points. First, pharmacists are supposed to satisfy themselves that their customer is 16 or over. Whether they go so far as to ask for proof of age is discretionary. They will also want to know that the pill is for you: RPS guidelines state that only in exceptional circumstances should Levonelle be sold to someone other than the patient. The pharmacist will then seek to establish that you do need to take the pill; in other words, that you have had unprotected sex within the last 72 hours. Women ought to remember that they are not required to provide either details or excuses (although the pharmacist may make suggestions about suitable contraceptives); simply state the facts. They will want to know if you could already be pregnant, in which case there would be no point selling this pill (though Levonelle does not appear to harm the baby if you do take it while already pregnant). So expect to be asked: Is your period late? If so, how late? Was the last one lighter or shorter than normal or unusual in any other way? Since the last one has there been unprotected sex at any time before this occasion? The pharmacist ought also to check that you are not taking any medicine that might interfere with Levonelle and that you have no problems (such as vomiting or severe diarrhoea) that might affect its absorption. Finally, you will be asked if you are aware of having an allergy to levonorgestrel, the ingredient in Levonelle, or if you have a severe liver complaint, in which case this drug is not recommended.

      "body": "<p>The murder of James Bulger by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson on February 12, 1993 was a horrific crime and the circumstances unusually shocking and distressing. </p> <p>It caused much public concern and a widespread feeling of moral outrage. There was massive national and international publicity both at the time of the murder and during and after the trial. </p> <p>Press and media coverage continued throughout the period of the detention of the two boys and increased at the time of the decision of the lord chief justice on the tariff and the hearing of the present proceedings. </p> <p>During the period of detention, injunctions have been in place which restricted the information the media was entitled to publish. Those injunctions came to an end on the 18th birthdays of the two boys. They made applications for injunctions to restrain publicity to run indefinitely. I granted interim injuctions on July 27, 2000 to continue until the full hearing of the applications. </p> <p>I heard full arguments for Venables and Thompson seeking injunctions, from four groups of newspapers opposing injunctions and from the attorney general and the official solicitor supporting the grant of injunctions. I also received evidence from the home secretary. I reserved my decision and handed it down today. </p> <p>I have decided that, taking into account the provisions of the European convention on human rights, the law of confidence may, in exceptional circumstances, be applied to protect individuals who are seriously at risk of injury or death if their identity or whereabouts became public knowledge and that the court has jurisdiction to grant injunctions to ensure their protection. </p> <p>I have been provided with a wealth of information from Home Office evidence, press reports, judicial observations, and other information that has convinced me that these young men are uniquely notorious and are at serious risk of attacks from members of the public as well as from relatives and friends of the murdered child. </p> <p>Threats to injure and to kill them have been set out in the evidence presented to me and have been reported in the press. I am satisfied that, although there has been balanced discussion in press articles in recent months, the sense of moral outrage has not diminished and there remains among some members of the public a serious desire for revenge if the two young men are living in the community. </p> <p>The Home Office views these threats very seriously and is likely to give Venables and Thompson new identities on their release from detention.

      "bodyText": "The murder of James Bulger by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson on February 12, 1993 was a horrific crime and the circumstances unusually shocking and distressing. It caused much public concern and a widespread feeling of moral outrage. There was massive national and international publicity both at the time of the murder and during and after the trial. Press and media coverage continued throughout the period of the detention of the two boys and increased at the time of the decision of the lord chief justice on the tariff and the hearing of the present proceedings. During the period of detention, injunctions have been in place which restricted the information the media was entitled to publish. Those injunctions came to an end on the 18th birthdays of the two boys. They made applications for injunctions to restrain publicity to run indefinitely. I granted interim injuctions on July 27, 2000 to continue until the full hearing of the applications. I heard full arguments for Venables and Thompson seeking injunctions, from four groups of newspapers opposing injunctions and from the attorney general and the official solicitor supporting the grant of injunctions. I also received evidence from the home secretary. I reserved my decision and handed it down today. I have decided that, taking into account the provisions of the European convention on human rights, the law of confidence may, in exceptional circumstances, be applied to protect individuals who are seriously at risk of injury or death if their identity or whereabouts became public knowledge and that the court has jurisdiction to grant injunctions to ensure their protection. I have been provided with a wealth of information from Home Office evidence, press reports, judicial observations, and other information that has convinced me that these young men are uniquely notorious and are at serious risk of attacks from members of the public as well as from relatives and friends of the murdered child. Threats to injure and to kill them have been set out in the evidence presented to me and have been reported in the press. I am satisfied that, although there has been balanced discussion in press articles in recent months, the sense of moral outrage has not diminished and there remains among some members of the public a serious desire for revenge if the two young men are living in the community. The Home Office views these threats very seriously and is likely to give Venables and Thompson new identities on their release from detention. I am therefore convinced that their lives are genuinely at risk as well as their physical safety if their new identities and whereabouts became public knowledge. I also read a number of press reports and editorials both from the time of the trial and later litigation and recently, and have come to the conclusion that certain sections of the press would not wish the two young men to remain anonymous and would wish to have them identified and if information about them became available, there was a real possibility it would be published. In my judgment, if any section of the media decided to give information leading to the identification of either young man, such publication would put his life at risk. In the exceptional circumstances of this case and applying English domestic law and the right to life enshrined in article 2 of the European convention, I have come to the conclusion that I am compelled to take steps in the almost unique circumstances of this case to protect their lives and well-being. I recognise the enormous importance of upholding freedom of expression and the right of the press to publish. I have, however, decided that, for the reasons I have given above, and set out at length in my judgment, it is necessary to grant injunctions to restrain the media from disclosing information about the new identity, appearance or addresses of Venables and Thompson when they are released from detention. In my judgment it is also necessary to restrain any publication of information about their present appearance and whereabouts in order to protect them on release. After a period of 12months it will not be necessary to restrain the media from disclosing information about the past which is not already protected by the existing rules of confidentiality. Since the information about their identity is so sensitive it will be necessary to continue to restrain information which might lead to finding them even if it has been placed in the public domain by publication for instance on the internet.",

Paedophiles too could invoke the ruling to ward off unwelcome press attention and vigilante attacks, Mr Browne warned. </p> <p>The ruling was a \"historic first\", he pointed out. No adult had ever before won a court order guaranteeing anonymity. The so-called Mary Bell order, the prototype for the injunction granted yesterday, was in fact not granted to protect the child killer but to safeguard her daughter from press attention. </p> <p>Had it not been for the existence of her daughter, the courts would have had no power to protect Mary Bell with a blanket ban on publishing or soliciting details of her new life. Yesterday's ruling could open the way for her to seek a new injunction to preserve her anonymity when her daughter reaches 18 and the current court order expires. She would have to show that her life was in danger from reprisals for her killing of two small boys in 1968 when she was aged 11. </p> <p>She served 12 years before her release and managed to remain out of the public eye till two years ago, when a book by Gitta Sereny, Cries Unheard: Why Children Kill - the Story of Mary Bell, was published and the Sun tracked her down. Some details of her new life found their way into the newspapers and she was given police protection. </p> <p>But Bell is no longer demonised - if she ever was - to anything like the same extent as Venables and Thompson, who abducted two-year-old James Bulger from a Merseyside shopping centre in February 1993, battered him to death and left his body on a railway line. She might not succeed in convincing a judge that publication of her whereabouts would put her life in danger. </p> <p>Myra Hindley, however, still rivals the Bulger killers as an icon of hate. Although successive home secretaries have said that in her case \"life means life\", she is challenging the home secretary's role in setting the tariff for murderers. The lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, predicted two months ago that judges may well remove from the government the right to decide when murderers go free. </p> <p>If that happens, Hindley could be released eventually, on licence, and provided with a new identity by the home office. Newspaper articles over the years painting her as a uniquely evil killer who should never be freed could prove, in her case, as convincing evidence of the danger of vigilante attacks as they did in the case of Thompson and Venables. </p> <p>Dame Elizabeth ruled that the court now had jurisdiction to grant an order extending anonymity into adulthood because of the Human Rights Act 1998, which came into force last October, making the European convention on human rights part of UK law. Under article 2 of the convention, the state is obliged to protect an individual's right to life. </p> <p>She had decided that the law may, in exceptional circumstances, be applied to protect individuals who are seriously at risk of injury or death if their identity or whereabouts became public knowledge. </p> <p>Allan Levy QC, who has advised Mary Bell, said: \"This is not a precedent in the sense that it opens the floodgates. But if another case comes along where there is evidence of serious risk to life, then it is likely it will be as persuasive in that case as it has been in this.\" </p> <p>Dame Elizabeth ruled that past information on Thompson and Venables, including the names of the secure units where they spent their time in custody and the rehabilitation regimes they underwent, could be published by the media after a \"cooling off\" period of 12 months.

But alas I feel as jaded, cynical and curmudgeonly as ever. The more things change the more they stay the same, as I believe the ever-philosophical French have been known to opine.</p> <p>So no surprise then that our intrepid punters managed another clean sweep of losers this week. Even the normally profitable Scott let us down, eschewing his usual value outsider for a good old fashioned 'Liverpool are going to thump them' wager.</p> <p>Haven't I always said avoid the obvious? No-one ever got rich backing Goliath to beat David. What's more, the good folk at Blue Square are well aware of the expectations of the average punter and skew their odds accordingly. Thus Joe Average expects lowly, unfashionable Rotherham to be on the wrong end of a good old-fashioned hammering at the hands of Liverpool, and so the bookies keep the prices artificially skinny as a result.</p> <p>For me the value in this match, and in most similar mismatches, is the half-time/full-time market where draw/favourite is often available at 5/1 or even longer. With the underdogs likely to be playing for the draw there is a fair chance they may hold out for 45 minutes but little they will hold out for 90. 5/1 certainly looks value, to me anyway, with the bookies artificially shortening favourite/favourite knowing it will be backed. </p> <p>Scott, doubtless, will protest that he nearly won, but there are no prizes for nearly. Not a good start to the year but there's plenty of time to put it right. </p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle:</strong> \u00a37 win double: Huddersfield v Bristol City: Huddersfield to win @ 8/11 and Burnley v Scunthorpe: Burnley to win @ 4/9 </p> <p>Oh Mr Ingle. What can I say? Another losing double. New Year is a time for reflection and for resolution, for working out what you're doing wrong and deciding how to put it right.

      "bodyText": "Current totals (from their initial \u00a3100 kitties): Scott Murray = \u00a3169.89, Sean Ingle = \u00a362.75, Football Unlimited punters collective = \u00a344.53, Paul MacInnes = \u00a337.45 Scott Murray: Liverpool v Rotherham - four goals or more \u00a315 @ 6/5 I suppose I should have returned from the Christmas break refreshed and raring to go. But alas I feel as jaded, cynical and curmudgeonly as ever. The more things change the more they stay the same, as I believe the ever-philosophical French have been known to opine. So no surprise then that our intrepid punters managed another clean sweep of losers this week. Even the normally profitable Scott let us down, eschewing his usual value outsider for a good old fashioned 'Liverpool are going to thump them' wager. Haven't I always said avoid the obvious? No-one ever got rich backing Goliath to beat David. What's more, the good folk at Blue Square are well aware of the expectations of the average punter and skew their odds accordingly. Thus Joe Average expects lowly, unfashionable Rotherham to be on the wrong end of a good old-fashioned hammering at the hands of Liverpool, and so the bookies keep the prices artificially skinny as a result. For me the value in this match, and in most similar mismatches, is the half-time/full-time market where draw/favourite is often available at 5/1 or even longer. With the underdogs likely to be playing for the draw there is a fair chance they may hold out for 45 minutes but little they will hold out for 90. 5/1 certainly looks value, to me anyway, with the bookies artificially shortening favourite/favourite knowing it will be backed. Scott, doubtless, will protest that he nearly won, but there are no prizes for nearly. Not a good start to the year but there's plenty of time to put it right. Sean Ingle: \u00a37 win double: Huddersfield v Bristol City: Huddersfield to win @ 8/11 and Burnley v Scunthorpe: Burnley to win @ 4/9 Oh Mr Ingle. What can I say? Another losing double. New Year is a time for reflection and for resolution, for working out what you're doing wrong and deciding how to put it right. And then actually putting it right. To quote Sean: \"I see that in-form Wolves are way over-priced at 7/2 to beat Forest, but hang on a second, what's happening to my hand and before I know it I've picked Huddersfield and Burnley to win instead.\" A winning value single becomes a losing shorter priced double before you can say \"Nottm Forest 0 Wolves 1\". Again the Inglemeister shows he has what it takes to pick winners. And again he turns winning selections into losing bets by his unnatural attachment to multiples. But there's still time to reform, Mr I, if not for me then for our children. Was that me? Paul MacInnes: Birmingham to beat Man City at 10/3 - \u00a35 Ah, the magic of the FA Cup, singles all round and a gin and tonic for the lady, isn't it? For all its alleged unpredictability the Cup is often quite a good money-making opportunity. Indeed, as I'm sure the more astute of you have already anticipated in that smart-arse way you have, tis the very unpredictability that makes for the profit - especially as Joe Average's betting habits mean the bookmakers are likely to lay a bit of value on the outsiders as well as on the draw (see below). In this case, Mr MacInnes may be right that Birmingham represented a bit of value - though ultimately, if the ever reliable Mr Raymond Stubbs is to be believed (which he most assuredly is by all right-thinking people or are the barbarians truly at the door), the might of the Premiership prevailed. The MacInnes millions are looking ever more threadbare but its not over 'til its over. The show must go on. Never give up on a good thing. If only all towns were like Milton Keynes. As it were. Neil Harnett of the Football Unlimited punter's collective: Walsall to beat West Ham, \u00a35 at 7/2 I can't argue with this bet. Literally. Lord knows I've tried but the words just won't come out.

The reason the criminal justice system was set up was to put an end to private blood feuds and lynch law. That was the reason the Guardian declined to join the four newspaper groups that asked the high court to lift the injunction protecting the anonymity of the killers of James Bulger, the Merseyside toddler. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the family division, rightly ruled yesterday that the protection should continue, even though the killers have now reached 18 and are expected to be released this year. </p> <p>There is a clear clash in this case between two separate and vital democratic principles - the right to free speech versus the right to privacy. We yield to no one in emphasising the need - and indeed fighting in the courts - to make Britain a more open society. But it is equally important for campaigners to recognise the limits of free speech. </p> <p>Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, the pair of deeply troubled 10-year-olds who killed James Bulger in 1993, will shortly have served the eight years which the lord chief justice declared last year should be the \"tariff\" for their crime. Their release, which will be decided by the parole board, will now depend purely on the risk that they pose to society. It is clear from the chief justice's judgment that, thanks to expert work by psychologists and support staff in the separate social service secure units in which the offenders were placed, the two young men no longer pose a risk. </p> <p>The application from media groups talked of the public right to know - and the danger of a slippery slope. Free speech is important but so is the protection of life. The threat to the two young men could not have been more specific. Dame Elizabeth's long judgment contains a catalogue of stories in which overt threats - both to kill as well as injure - have been made against the young men by the public as well as relatives and friends of the murdered child. Home Office staff confirmed that they were taking these seriously. They were right to do so, following the fire-bombing of homes of suspected paedophiles by vigilante groups, spurred on by our tabloid press. </p> <p>But is this a dangerous precedent? No. As the judge noted, the case has \"almost unique circumstances\". This is only the second time in the history of the Home Office that new identities have been planned for child murderers in anticipation of their release. The reason why this has been necessary is the tabloid's obsession with the offenders and their hysterical coverage of the case. Thankfully, the ban will prevent the tabloids from disclosing information about their new identities or their appearance or the addresses where they will be living. </p> <p>Remember, if the boys had been just a few months younger, there would not have been a trial at all - they would have been below the age of criminal responsibility. In most other European countries, 10-year-olds would not have been prosecuted. The European court of human rights ruled the trial \"unconstitutional\", although it did not overturn the convictions. </p> <p>The ban is unequivocal. It cannot apply beyond the English and Welsh borders or to the internet, but the judge made it clear that the English media would be clobbered if it tried to get round the ban by reporting facts appearing on the internet or in the Scottish media. The tabloids will protest, but brought the curbs on themselves. Rehabilitating the two remains the best public protection. </p>",

That was the reason the Guardian declined to join the four newspaper groups that asked the high court to lift the injunction protecting the anonymity of the killers of James Bulger, the Merseyside toddler. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the family division, rightly ruled yesterday that the protection should continue, even though the killers have now reached 18 and are expected to be released this year. There is a clear clash in this case between two separate and vital democratic principles - the right to free speech versus the right to privacy. We yield to no one in emphasising the need - and indeed fighting in the courts - to make Britain a more open society. But it is equally important for campaigners to recognise the limits of free speech. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, the pair of deeply troubled 10-year-olds who killed James Bulger in 1993, will shortly have served the eight years which the lord chief justice declared last year should be the \"tariff\" for their crime. Their release, which will be decided by the parole board, will now depend purely on the risk that they pose to society. It is clear from the chief justice's judgment that, thanks to expert work by psychologists and support staff in the separate social service secure units in which the offenders were placed, the two young men no longer pose a risk. The application from media groups talked of the public right to know - and the danger of a slippery slope. Free speech is important but so is the protection of life. The threat to the two young men could not have been more specific. Dame Elizabeth's long judgment contains a catalogue of stories in which overt threats - both to kill as well as injure - have been made against the young men by the public as well as relatives and friends of the murdered child. Home Office staff confirmed that they were taking these seriously. They were right to do so, following the fire-bombing of homes of suspected paedophiles by vigilante groups, spurred on by our tabloid press. But is this a dangerous precedent? No. As the judge noted, the case has \"almost unique circumstances\". This is only the second time in the history of the Home Office that new identities have been planned for child murderers in anticipation of their release. The reason why this has been necessary is the tabloid's obsession with the offenders and their hysterical coverage of the case. Thankfully, the ban will prevent the tabloids from disclosing information about their new identities or their appearance or the addresses where they will be living. Remember, if the boys had been just a few months younger, there would not have been a trial at all - they would have been below the age of criminal responsibility. In most other European countries, 10-year-olds would not have been prosecuted. The European court of human rights ruled the trial \"unconstitutional\", although it did not overturn the convictions. The ban is unequivocal. It cannot apply beyond the English and Welsh borders or to the internet, but the judge made it clear that the English media would be clobbered if it tried to get round the ban by reporting facts appearing on the internet or in the Scottish media. The tabloids will protest, but brought the curbs on themselves. Rehabilitating the two remains the best public protection.",

      "bodyText": "Until today it was safe to say that the market in Britain for Mandarin films about duty and suppressed desire in 18th-century China was a little on the limited side. But after a weekend in which teenagers queued for the chance to hang on the words of lovelorn philosophising warrior mystics, Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, all that may be about to change. The film that has persuaded thousands of cinema-goers to brush up on their history of the Han dynasties, is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The spectacular martial arts film with enough emotional depth for art house credibility took 10 times more at the box office in London on its opening weekend than the best-performing new US film, the Kim Basinger vehicle Bless the Child. With ticket sales of \u00a3686,386 from just 88 screens in three days, Crouching Tiger is now well on the way to eclipsing the Oscar-winning Life Is Beautiful as the most successful foreign language film ever shown here. What is even more surprising is that some of this subtle, feminist film's most vocal supporters have been in the tabloids, whose critics have competed to shower superlatives on its Hong Kong stars, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh, whose doomed, unrealised love affair - think Brief Encounter with kick-boxing - is the movie's beating heart. Crouching Tiger and its director Ang Lee are already the clever bets for the Oscars for best film and director. Ang Lee has been unlucky to miss out before with his masterly adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense And Sensibility, The Ice Storm and The Wedding Banquet where he gave unusual depth to his female characters. He has in fact been credited with creating a whole new genre of intelligent karate film with Crouching Tiger. With eye-popping fight sequences - most memorably a tree-top duel - Crouching Tiger is sure of a clutch of special effects awards. More im portantly iCrouching Tiger has become a boon for independent cinemas whose fight to keep foreign cinema alive here has at times been thankless. The Duke of York in Brighton has seen nothing like it since it managed to get a print of the cult hit The Blair Witch Project a week before it went on general release. Spokesman Dean Stewart said the film's great strength was that it had something for everyone. \"It's a great martial arts film, it's got a love interest and it is beautiful to look at. I have not seen a film for a long time which had such a warm reaction from so many different people. It is great to see people who wouldn't normally go to a foreign language film having such a good time.\" Next week the multiplexes will try to cash in, and Crouching Tiger is likely to be showing on up to five times as many screens across the country.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>With permission Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on depleted uranium.</p> <p>During the last few days concern has been expressed in the media and in this House about possible exposure of United Kingdom forces to depleted uranium in the Balkans. This reflects a series of media reports that the health of peacekeepers in Bosnia or Kosovo may have been affected by their deployment. It is suggested that some UK service personnel may have become ill as a result of exposure to depleted uranium in the Balkans.</p> <p>This afternoon I will set out our position on depleted uranium, and list the steps we are taking and intend to take.</p> <p>Depleted uranium is a very dense heavy metal. It results from the uranium enrichment process, and because the majority of the more radioactive isotopes are removed in this process, depleted uranium is about 40% less radioactive than natural uranium. Because of its density and metallurgic properties, depleted uranium is ideally suited for use as a kinetic energy penetrator for use in anti-armour munitions.</p> <p>The UK has developed and deployed a 120mm armour piercing round for use in the Challenger Main Battle Tank. This ammunition was used in the Gulf war, where around 100 rounds were fired by us against Iraqi armour, as well as some rounds during training in Saudi Arabia. This ammunition provides a battle winning military capability.</p> <p>Alternative materials are not as effective. Therefore DU will remain part of our arsenal for the foreseeable future because when this country commits our forces to conflict we fight to win. Our troops need the best available equipment to enable them to do this. To deny them a legitimate capability would be quite wrong.</p> <p>Handled in accordance with the regulations, DU shells present no hazard to our forces. We have long recognised, however, that on the battlefield its debris might present a hazard from chemical toxicity, in the same way as any heavy metal such as lead, and a low level radiological hazard. The risk from chemical toxicity would arise from ingestion of the soluble depleted uranium oxides, and the radiological risk primarily from inhalation of the insoluble depleted uranium oxides. These risks arise from the dust created when DU strikes a hard target such as an armoured vehicle. In its massive form, as expended rounds or solid fragments it is a negligible hazard.</p> <p>In response to the health concerns of Gulf veterans, the Ministry of Defence has, both in 1993 and 1999 published details of these hazards, together with our estimates of the risk which they might have posed to troops in the Gulf. We believe those risks to have been low, which is borne out by the findings of our Medical Assessment Programme for Gulf Veterans. There has been no evidence, during the deployment, or subsequently, of kidney damage which would be the chief indication of heavy metal poisoning. Radiological damage would only become manifested as an increased rate of cancer after a long period of latency. Furthermore, there is currently no evidence after 10 years, of a higher rate of cancer amongst Gulf veterans compared to a control group. We currently offer tests to Gulf veterans who attend the medical assessment programme for whole body load of uranium, if there is a clinical indication that uranium might be linked to the illnesses which they manifest.</p> <p>Substantial amounts of research into the health risks of uranium have been conducted and published over many years. Recent work by reputable bodies has assessed this literature in the context of battlefield exposures to DU. The conclusions of all this work, including that by the Rand corporation, the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the US Institute of Medicine, is that there is no evidence linking DU to cancers or to the more general ill health being experienced by some Gulf veterans.</p> <p>As regards exposures, important work at the Baltimore veterans Affairs Clinic in the United States is monitoring Gulf veterans known to be at the highest risk of exposure due to \"friendly fire\" incidents. None of these troops, including those who retain DU shrapnel in their bodies have health problems related to DU. Testing Gulf and Balkans veterans for uranium in the US, Canada, and Belgium has failed to show any of them excreting higher than background levels unless they have embedded shrapnel.</p> <p>Depleted uranium has also been fired by Nato forces during operations in Bosnia in 1994 and 1995, and in Kosovo in 1999. Compared to around 300 tons fired in the Gulf, only 3 tons was fired in Bosnia, and around 9 tons in Kosovo, very little of it in what is now the British sector.</p> <p>Conscious of the potential risks which DU posed, we issued precautionary guidance to our forces in Kosovo about the need not to approach recently struck burned out armoured vehicles possibly hit by DU, which present the main hazard, and to wear suitable protective clothing if they had to work in the vicinity of these vehicles.</p> <p>The working environment of our forces in the Balkans is already closely monitored because of health and safety and environmental concerns about the theatre which extend well beyond the question of DU. There is to date no evidence of which the Ministry of Defence is aware of unusual ill health amongst our Balkan peacekeepers, or specifically any ill health that would suggest heavy metal poisoning. Indeed a thorough epidemiological study was done by King's College in the context of Gulf health, which examined a cohort of nearly 4,000 Bosnia peacekeepers. They found no difference in the level of symptoms between them and troops not deployed to the Gulf or Bosnia.</p> <p>Media reports have also focused on the test firing of DU at UK ranges. Apart from a small amount of contained firing at Foulness and Aldermaston, this has been concentrated in the ranges at Kirkcudbright on the Solway Firth, and at Eskmeals in Cumbria. It is fired at Kirkudbright into the sea, and at Eskmeals until 1995 into armour plate targets. Safety at the ranges, and in their environs has been a paramount concern. The DU firing programme is subject to regulation under the Ionising Radiation regulations 2000. The Environment Agency and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency also have oversight of the firing programme. A detailed review of the environmental impact of firing DU at these ranges was undertaken by independent environmental consultants WS Atkins. The consultants concluded that the radiation doses to members of the public and the associated risks from DU released into the environment were extremely low.</p> <p>I have spelt out the background to depleted uranium and ours and other's existing research on the issue. These issues are not new, and we must not unduly alarm service personnel or their families about the position.</p> <p>That said, we do recognise that some of the recent coverage will have caused some concerns amongst our people, and we recognise a need to reassure them. We take very seriously our responsibility to the Service personnel and civilians given the demands which we make on them during operations.</p> <p>Our response therefore will be to identify an additional appropriate voluntary screening programme for our service personnel and civilians who have served in the Balkans. We will do this on the basis of the best available science. We will consult appropriate national bodies such as the UK National Screening Committee of the UK Department of Health. Another important source of external scientific advice will be the report currently under preparation by the Royal Society which is taking an independent look at depleted uranium.</p> <p>It also will be important to co-ordinate an approach with allies, many of whom are assessing the same reports as I make this statement. A crucial part of our approach will be to discuss with allies their data on risks to health in the Balkans, the health of peacekeepers in the Balkans, the responses which they plan, and to ensure that all data available across Nato is pooled as a basis for subsequent decisions. We are also conscious that the United Nations Environmental Programme have surveyed sites in Kosovo and we await the publication of their final report with interest. I should add that their interim statement refers to only slightly elevated levels of radiation at 8 of the sites they monitored. I am also announcing that the UK will enhance its existing environmental surveillance programme in the Balkans to ensure that no health threats to our forces, and indeed to the local civilian population, are overlooked.</p> <p>In the meantime, any individual who believes that their health may have been damaged by service in the Balkans should seek medical advice. If their doctor considers that there is evidence that depleted uranium might have contributed to ill health then tests for uranium levels will be carried out.</p> <p>I hope this statement puts the current debate in context and provides necessary reassurance to the House as well as our forces and their families and indicates the way ahead. We are providing battle winning equipment for our forces and also taking seriously our responsibility for their welfare. I am sure the House would agree they deserve no less.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uranium/story/0,7369,420009,00.html\">9 January: War veterans to be screened for uranium</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uranium/story/0,7369,419892,00.html \">9 January: Climbdown on Gulf war syndrome</a></p> <p><b>The issue explained</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uranium/story/0,7369,419882,00.html\">Depleted uranium</a></p> <p><b> Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.tv.cbc.ca/national/pgminfo/du/index.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> The Silver Bullet: CBC (Canada) coverage</a><br> <a href=\"http://cbc.ca/cgi-bin/templates/view.cgi?/news/2001/01/04/balkans010104\" target=\"_NEW\">Inquiries into 'Balkan Syndrome'</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.tv.cbc.ca/national/pgminfo/du/doc1.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> The Los Alamos memorandum</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.antenna.nl/wise/uranium/dissbk.html\" target=\"_NEW\">DU weapons use in the Balkans</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.antenna.nl/wise/uranium/img/dukosom.gif\" target=\"_NEW\">Nato map showing where DU munitions were used</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.atk.com/conmun/descriptions/medium-cal-ammo/gau-8.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Manufacturer's sales pitch for DU shells</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.web-light.nl/VISIE/ud_main.html\" target=\"_NEW\">More DU links</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.healthboards.com/gulf-war-syndrome/847.html\" target=\"_NEW\">UK Gulf Veterans and Families Association</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/index.php3?page=955\" target=\"_NEW\">Ministry of Defence links</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/c mdfence/753/75304.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Commons Defence Committee report</a></p>",

That said, we do recognise that some of the recent coverage will have caused some concerns amongst our people, and we recognise a need to reassure them. We take very seriously our responsibility to the Service personnel and civilians given the demands which we make on them during operations. Our response therefore will be to identify an additional appropriate voluntary screening programme for our service personnel and civilians who have served in the Balkans. We will do this on the basis of the best available science. We will consult appropriate national bodies such as the UK National Screening Committee of the UK Department of Health. Another important source of external scientific advice will be the report currently under preparation by the Royal Society which is taking an independent look at depleted uranium. It also will be important to co-ordinate an approach with allies, many of whom are assessing the same reports as I make this statement. A crucial part of our approach will be to discuss with allies their data on risks to health in the Balkans, the health of peacekeepers in the Balkans, the responses which they plan, and to ensure that all data available across Nato is pooled as a basis for subsequent decisions. We are also conscious that the United Nations Environmental Programme have surveyed sites in Kosovo and we await the publication of their final report with interest. I should add that their interim statement refers to only slightly elevated levels of radiation at 8 of the sites they monitored. I am also announcing that the UK will enhance its existing environmental surveillance programme in the Balkans to ensure that no health threats to our forces, and indeed to the local civilian population, are overlooked. In the meantime, any individual who believes that their health may have been damaged by service in the Balkans should seek medical advice. If their doctor considers that there is evidence that depleted uranium might have contributed to ill health then tests for uranium levels will be carried out. I hope this statement puts the current debate in context and provides necessary reassurance to the House as well as our forces and their families and indicates the way ahead. We are providing battle winning equipment for our forces and also taking seriously our responsibility for their welfare. I am sure the House would agree they deserve no less.

It can't have been a lot of fun squatting in a cave with no central heating and a food source that was almost as likely to have you for dinner. It wouldn't have been perpetually joyous in the middle Ages, either; if you weren't murdered for your purse in a stinking alley or sent off to fight in some hellish war, you fell prey to some pretty vicious diseases. Nor were the Victorians exactly a light-hearted bunch. </p> <p>Why is it then that we - blessed with health, wealth and leisure undreamed of by our benighted forebears, likely to live a lot longer than the biblical threescore years and 10 and with every type of cultural diversion available to us, even if only as a spectator in our own home through the television - seem just as miserable as any of them? Why, in fact, are we so depressed? </p> <p>Millions of us are falling prey to what is now identified as a disease. Five million of us each year have some sort of depressive illness that would justify medical intervention. That's not much less than a tenth of the population. A third of those who go to the GP have underlying depression. The young, with the world ahead of them, should have the blithest hearts. Yet 12% of male students and 15% of female students at university are depressed. Yesterday, meanwhile, it emerged that university counsellors are reporting a dramatic increase in the number of students seeking help for severe mental problems. Just over a year ago, the World Health Organisation declared that depression had reached epidemic proportions. Within 20 years, the WHO said, it would be the world's second most debilitating illness after cardiovascular disease in terms of lost years of human productivity. Depression is paralysing human-kind, destroying our capacity to work and create, in a way that infection used to. </p> <p>Or is it? Are we really more depressed than ever before, as the patient group Depression Alliance believes, or is this the same sadness that Hippocrates classified as melancholy - something that has always been with us. Some might say that what has really changed is that we can now diagnose depression, and that there is an incentive to diagnose depression because for the past few decades, the psychiatrists have been able to do something about it. Does the real rise in depression date from the advent of the antidepressants? </p> <p>Patricia White of the Depression Alliance agrees that depression has always been with us even if it was not identified. In the past, she thinks, \"We had too much else to do so that was not a question that was asked. We asked, 'Do you have enough money?' or 'Has your husband got a job?' \" But for her, what has happened is more than a redefinition. She believes that \"we are now more predisposed to being depressed\" because of the phenomenal pace of social change, a view with which the WHO concurs. \"We have never come this far in such a short period of time,\" she says. \"I think we're under more pressure now than we ever have been before. Technology is supposed to have made our lives so much better, but has it? There has been such rapid progress over the past 30 years - in fact probably postwar. There has been a breakdown of what we used to call the family. Students are under more pressure.\" Although human beings have proved themselves incredibly adaptable over the ages, she wonders how good their coping mechanisms are in the face of such enormous and rapid change. </p> <p>The alliance is firmly wedded to treatment for everyone with depression, and has been campaigning, along with the Royal College of Psychiatrists and others, for greater recognition of the illness by GPs and the public, and the removal of the stigma attached to so many who are diagnosed with mental health problems. </p> <p>Not all depression is severe. Some is mild enough probably to go away by itself. But the alliance believes that everybody must be urged to get treatment, because it is the only way to catch those whose depression will become severe enough to make them try to kill themselves. \"There were almost 7,000 suicides in the UK last year. Almost 75% are attributed to depression,\" says White. \"That is because in that 75% we know there had been a history and a diagnosis of depression. But in all truth it is highly unlikely that anyone will kill themselves if they are not depressed.\" </p> <p>Jo Borrill of the Mental Health Foundation says that some people can get better without treatment, which includes counselling and cognitive behaviour therapies as well as medication, but the problem is that some people have no idea what to do about their depression, if they recognise it as depression. They do not know that the GP has help and advice to give. </p> <p>In the past, she says, some people must have come out of their depression without drugs or therapy. \"I think some people did, but some people suffered. The most important thing is that we're always trying to do better. We have got higher expectations and we don't want to be satisfied with people being miserable.\" </p> <p>Depression is diagnosed when people have a number of classic symptoms over a number of weeks. They include feeling tired, sleeping too much or too little, increased anxiety, difficulty concentrating, a feeling that life is pointless and a loss of sex drive. A few of these over some time or all of them for a few days does not qualify as depression. </p> <p>The cause, say doctors, is a chemical imbalance - a fall in the serotonin levels that are responsible for our happier feelings. But that is not an unnatural event. They must fluctuate for us to feel any emotion. What the scientists who devised medication to alter serotonin levels - the basis of the SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) like Prozac - do not know is whether low serotonin levels cause depression or whether depression causes serotonin levels to fall. </p> <p>Psychiatrist Jim Bolton, who lectures at St George's hospital medical school in London, suggests that people may need both medication and therapy. \"Imagine you are being thrown overboard into the sea. You need two things - a lifebelt, which is the medication, to stop you drowning, and once you have reached shallower water, swimming lessons (therapy) to prevent it happening again,\" he says. </p> <p>Cognitive behaviour therapy is probably the treatment most likely to help people climb permanently out of the cycle of depression. It helps people set targets for changing their life and dispelling negative thinking and beliefs. </p> <p>But it is in short supply. Drugs are cheaper, quicker and easier for the NHS to hand out. They help a lot of people. They undoubtedly save lives. But their very ease and availability may be increasing the pool of people now categorised as depressed - the very many whose depression is at the mild end of the scale. We have drugs to treat depression, and so the medical profession is keen to invite more people to come forward and be treated. The pharmaceutical companies who make those drugs urge them on in the war against depression. </p> <p>Edward Shorter, psychiatrist and medical historian at the University of Toronto, believes that there is a difference between unhappiness, which is part of the human condition, and depression. Giving a paper in London in October 1999, he said: \"Unhappiness, as we know, responds readily if not durably to ethanol [alcohol]. It certainly responds to such street drugs as cocaine. And it responds, as a generation of users can now testify, to SSRIs.\" </p> <p>When discussing the worldwide burden of depression, he said, \"we therefore do well to keep in mind that there is indeed an enormous worldwide burden of unhappiness, that some of this unhappiness is the result of psychiatric illness, and, finally, that some of this illness is clinical depression.\" </p> <p> In an earlier paper, in 1997, he wrote that he believed the definition of depression had been changed to encompass more people than ever before. \"The boundaries of what constitutes depression have been expanded relentlessly outward. Depression as a major psychiatric illness involving bleakness of mood, self-loathing, and inability to experience pleasure and suicidal thoughts has been familiar for many centuries. The illness has a heavy biological component. </p> <p>\"Depression in the vocabulary of post 1960s American psychiatry has become tantamount to dysphoria, meaning unhappiness, in combination with loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping.\" Taken to the extreme, depression in its mildest form becomes a quality of life issue. We have better health and longer life than ever before. Why should we not have relief from unhappiness, just as readily as from pain? </p> <p>\u0095 For information on depression, call the Depression Alliance on: 020-7633 0557.

But the alliance believes that everybody must be urged to get treatment, because it is the only way to catch those whose depression will become severe enough to make them try to kill themselves. \"There were almost 7,000 suicides in the UK last year. Almost 75% are attributed to depression,\" says White. \"That is because in that 75% we know there had been a history and a diagnosis of depression. But in all truth it is highly unlikely that anyone will kill themselves if they are not depressed.\" Jo Borrill of the Mental Health Foundation says that some people can get better without treatment, which includes counselling and cognitive behaviour therapies as well as medication, but the problem is that some people have no idea what to do about their depression, if they recognise it as depression. They do not know that the GP has help and advice to give. In the past, she says, some people must have come out of their depression without drugs or therapy. \"I think some people did, but some people suffered. The most important thing is that we're always trying to do better. We have got higher expectations and we don't want to be satisfied with people being miserable.\" Depression is diagnosed when people have a number of classic symptoms over a number of weeks. They include feeling tired, sleeping too much or too little, increased anxiety, difficulty concentrating, a feeling that life is pointless and a loss of sex drive. A few of these over some time or all of them for a few days does not qualify as depression. The cause, say doctors, is a chemical imbalance - a fall in the serotonin levels that are responsible for our happier feelings. But that is not an unnatural event. They must fluctuate for us to feel any emotion. What the scientists who devised medication to alter serotonin levels - the basis of the SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) like Prozac - do not know is whether low serotonin levels cause depression or whether depression causes serotonin levels to fall. Psychiatrist Jim Bolton, who lectures at St George's hospital medical school in London, suggests that people may need both medication and therapy. \"Imagine you are being thrown overboard into the sea. You need two things - a lifebelt, which is the medication, to stop you drowning, and once you have reached shallower water, swimming lessons (therapy) to prevent it happening again,\" he says. Cognitive behaviour therapy is probably the treatment most likely to help people climb permanently out of the cycle of depression. It helps people set targets for changing their life and dispelling negative thinking and beliefs. But it is in short supply. Drugs are cheaper, quicker and easier for the NHS to hand out. They help a lot of people. They undoubtedly save lives. But their very ease and availability may be increasing the pool of people now categorised as depressed - the very many whose depression is at the mild end of the scale. We have drugs to treat depression, and so the medical profession is keen to invite more people to come forward and be treated. The pharmaceutical companies who make those drugs urge them on in the war against depression. Edward Shorter, psychiatrist and medical historian at the University of Toronto, believes that there is a difference between unhappiness, which is part of the human condition, and depression. Giving a paper in London in October 1999, he said: \"Unhappiness, as we know, responds readily if not durably to ethanol [alcohol]. It certainly responds to such street drugs as cocaine. And it responds, as a generation of users can now testify, to SSRIs.\" When discussing the worldwide burden of depression, he said, \"we therefore do well to keep in mind that there is indeed an enormous worldwide burden of unhappiness, that some of this unhappiness is the result of psychiatric illness, and, finally, that some of this illness is clinical depression.\" In an earlier paper, in 1997, he wrote that he believed the definition of depression had been changed to encompass more people than ever before. \"The boundaries of what constitutes depression have been expanded relentlessly outward. Depression as a major psychiatric illness involving bleakness of mood, self-loathing, and inability to experience pleasure and suicidal thoughts has been familiar for many centuries. The illness has a heavy biological component. \"Depression in the vocabulary of post 1960s American psychiatry has become tantamount to dysphoria, meaning unhappiness, in combination with loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping.\" Taken to the extreme, depression in its mildest form becomes a quality of life issue. We have better health and longer life than ever before. Why should we not have relief from unhappiness, just as readily as from pain? \u0095 For information on depression, call the Depression Alliance on: 020-7633 0557.

That leaves me in a minority of 3%, and I don't believe that. It makes me wonder who they have asked and how they phrased the question. </p> <p>The 97% figure has been trotted out ever since the first pilot schemes were assessed, and it was trotted out again recently as we were asked to celebrate the extension of NHS Direct to the whole of England. Call me a sceptic, but when does the British public ever give any institution a consistently sky-high confidence rating like that? </p> <p>As it happens, I'm four-square behind the principle of NHS Direct. Busy people - and anyone with children is a busy person - like nothing better than to pick up a phone and get some help. Few of us want to bundle a sick child up and drive to accident and emergency. Most of us, although I hear the scornful laughs of doctors already, do not want to call out a GP except for something really serious. </p> <p>This was not a casualty scenario. I am well familiar with the waiting rooms of ear, nose and throat clinics. We have been down the grommet road. I can talk glue ear with anybody. All I wanted to know was what I could do for the pain my hysterical child was suffering, but on the end of the line was what NHS Direct likes to term \"a highly trained call handler\" who has a script in front of her, just as she would have if she was taking calls to a mail-order catalogue. I told her half an hour to an hour was no good to me - it would be over one way or the other by then. I was right. The eardrum burst and the pain stopped. Thanks a million for the support, NHS Direct. </p> <p>Maybe I was unlucky to get an automaton on the end of the phone that night who could have been asking me which size and colour jacket I wanted, for all the sympathy in her voice.

      "bodyText": "This is NHS Direct. Name please.\" \"Oh, hello. I wondered if you could just tell me . . .\" \"Postcode?\" \". . . what I should do because my child is in real pain . . .\" \"Phone number?\" \". . . with her ears. I've given her the maximum amount of paracetamol it says on the bottle . . .\" \"GP's name?\" \". . . but it hasn't helped and all I want to know is . . .\" \"Address?\" \". . . can I give her any more?\" \"A nurse will ring you back in half an hour to an hour's time.\" \"But she's crying and crying and it's the middle of the night and I want to know what to do RIGHT NOW.\" \"She'll ring you back.\" The government tells us that 97% of patients have been at least satisfied with their experience of NHS Direct, the telephone helpline set up to give us rapid access to the advice of a nurse. That leaves me in a minority of 3%, and I don't believe that. It makes me wonder who they have asked and how they phrased the question. The 97% figure has been trotted out ever since the first pilot schemes were assessed, and it was trotted out again recently as we were asked to celebrate the extension of NHS Direct to the whole of England. Call me a sceptic, but when does the British public ever give any institution a consistently sky-high confidence rating like that? As it happens, I'm four-square behind the principle of NHS Direct. Busy people - and anyone with children is a busy person - like nothing better than to pick up a phone and get some help. Few of us want to bundle a sick child up and drive to accident and emergency. Most of us, although I hear the scornful laughs of doctors already, do not want to call out a GP except for something really serious. This was not a casualty scenario. I am well familiar with the waiting rooms of ear, nose and throat clinics. We have been down the grommet road. I can talk glue ear with anybody. All I wanted to know was what I could do for the pain my hysterical child was suffering, but on the end of the line was what NHS Direct likes to term \"a highly trained call handler\" who has a script in front of her, just as she would have if she was taking calls to a mail-order catalogue. I told her half an hour to an hour was no good to me - it would be over one way or the other by then. I was right. The eardrum burst and the pain stopped. Thanks a million for the support, NHS Direct. Maybe I was unlucky to get an automaton on the end of the phone that night who could have been asking me which size and colour jacket I wanted, for all the sympathy in her voice. I am sure that the nurse would eventually have rung me back and given me impeccable advice, albeit too late. But it seems to me that NHS Direct is failing to fulfil a real need if it cannot offer patients immediate and genuine comfort and support. We are all increasingly healthy. Most of the problems we are taking to our doctors these days are not life-threatening, and many are not all that serious. Doctors complain about being besieged by the \"worried well\".

      "bodyText": "A celebrity chef who worked as the Times cookery writer today told how she found out she had been sacked by e-mail in a 'callous and unthinking' manner after 13 years' service with the paper. Frances Bissell, 54, who has won numerous awards for her cooking ability, is claiming unfair dismissal against the newspaper. Mrs Bissell told an employment tribunal yesterday that she received a very brief email from the editor of the Weekend section of the paper tellng her she had been fired. It reached her just after she had returned from America where she was helping her husband arrange her mother-in-law's funeral. A few days later she received official confirmation in a letter from the paper's editor, Ben Preston. She said that when she received the email she felt that her livelihood had been 'removed' at a stroke. Mrs Bissell told the tribunal, in Stratford, east London: \"I should like to describe the manner of my departure last August. \"I refer to the exchange of emails between Jane Wheatley, the recently appointed editor of Weekend, and me, and the letter from Ben Preston, acting editor of the Times. \"I did not receive this letter until after the email.\" The email read: \"Dear Frances, By now I imagine you will have received the Editor's letter suggesting that it's time to bring your long and distinguished association with the Times to a close. \"I should like to have a talk with you - to discuss the manner of your going and, not least, your farewell dinner which I hope very much you will allow us to give you. \"However, I know you have only just returned from America so I will leave it to you to suggest a time that would suit you - by return email or by phone.\" Mrs Bissell told the tribunal: \"Given what has been widely acknowledged to be a long and distinguished career with The Times, I was distressed to be treated in this callous and unthinking manner, the results of which have led to stress, humiliation and embarrassment in the ensuing weeks. \"My livelihood was removed at a stroke. I have never felt so wronged in my life. \"In the last few years I have consulted my GP about insomnia, high blood pressure, eczema, shingles and what turned out to be cancer. This is hardly the rude health of a carefree freelance.\" The cook told the tribunal that she did a lot of extra work for the newspaper without asking for any payment. She said: \"I was the Times cook for over 13 years, writing half the page or more every week without a break from the 25 July 1987 to 31 August 2000. \"The wording of the contract was such that I was not free to write for other national daily newspapers in Britain. It transpired that this also included Sunday newspapers. \"I wrote a food feature for the Sunday Times on December 27 1987 and was hauled over the coals the following week by the assistant features editor to whom the editor expressed his displeasure that 'his' cookery writer was writing for another newspaper.\" She said that although she had no set hours and was a freelance writer she was expected to be constantly available to answer any questions relating to her copy. She added: \"Whilst I was not expected to attend the Times office, I was nevertheless required to be available for meetings with section editors and marketing staff, either at the Times or places of their choosing. \"When I travelled abroad I remained in constant touch with the section by phone, fax and email, supplying copy to cover my period away.\" Mrs Bissell said that over her 13 years with the Times she developed a number of products to sell as readers' offers including Christmas cakes, brandy butter and the famous Times Christmas pudding. She said: \"In corespndence with my readers, and in all my dealings in the food and cookery world at home and abroad, I was treated as the Times representative and felt my self to be so. \"During this period I won the Glenfiddich Cookery Writer of the Year and a James Beard Foundation award in America as well as being elected as the first woman chef in France or Britain to the Academy of Culinary Arts.\" The hearing continues.",

      "bodyText": "The BBC is the latest firm to come under union scrutiny over its powers to open staff emails. Broadcasting workers' union Bectu and journalists' union the NUJ are concerned about how the BBC could use the new Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to \"snoop\" on staff. Last April the BBC issued guidelines to clarify its approach to opening and reading confidential emails. They stated that the corporation's approach to opening staff emails would be \"appropriate and proportionate\". Unions say that on the whole the BBC takes a \"liberal\" approach towards emails and other private correspondence, which they say is \"better than most employers\". But under the controversial new Act, which became law last November, the corporation has stated that it is entitled to read staff emails. A Bectu spokesman said \"They are saying that with regard to the RIP act, they are entitled to access emails.\" \"They have said they don't want to do it unilaterally, but if it comes to a BBC manager's attention that someone is using email inappropriately, they want to be able to access it,\" he continued. Bectu and the NUJ want guarantees that staff emails will not be opened without a warning. But a BBC spokeswoman said, \"If you have reason to think that an employee is committing fraud, it might not be possible to warn them beforehand.\" Unions are also concerned about a BBC policy which states that any illegal activity on a BBC workstation is the responsibility of the person who is logged on at that particular time. The Bectu spokesman said BBC staff had been wrongly sacked under this policy. \"We are simply saying that we don't want any changes to the guidelines being made without us being consulted beforehand.\" The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act allows bosses to open their employees emails, and has come under fire from freedom of speech campaigners.",

All EU states have to meet the criteria before joining the euro.

The chancellor, Gordon Brown, has set his face against giving a running commentary on Britain's prospects for joining, or whether the economy is meeting the separate five tests set out by the Treasury in 1997. The lack of publicity surrounding the report yesterday prompted claims from the pressure group Business for Sterling that the Treasury is intent on suppressing a debate about the prospects of British entry. \"It may be sharp politics for Gordon Brown, but it is a shabby way to conduct a debate,\" said Dominic Cummings, campaign director for Business for Sterling.

It states the UK domestic reform agenda is well served by the policies of European economic reform agreed at Lisbon, as both share the same aim of raising growth through increased employment. It concludes: \"Euro area activity is now stronger than expected, boosted by global recovery and currency weakness. High levels of consumer and business confidence have been accompanied by a significant decline in unemployment.\" The report also claims further progress in the past year to \"prepare both the private and public sectors for introduction of the euro and and for possible Emu entry.\"",

      "bodyText": "Islamic leaders and the Catholic church in Africa have found uncommon purpose in their opposition to Aids education by arguing that it is a western plot to spread immorality. Opposition to an American-backed conference on Aids on the continent has come, ironically, from Islamic and Christian clergy in Kano, northern Nigeria, where followers of the two faiths are otherwise at sometimes violent odds over the introduction of sharia law. The Catholic church in Zambia has also denounced Aids education programmes for promoting promiscuity and so helping spread the disease. More than 25m people in Africa are HIV positive or have Aids, about 75% of the global total. Last year alone, 2.4m Africans died of the disease. By the end of this year there are expected to be 13m Aids orphans in Africa. The UN has called it a \"catastrophe\". Beside the immediate human tragedy, the disease is expect to severely damage African economies. In South Africa - which has the largest economy on the continent and the highest number of infections in the world - it is expected to cut the country's GDP by 17%. But there are sharply differing views on the causes and solutions to the crisis. Religious leaders are increasingly blaming Aids education programmes, usually drafted and funded by the UN or western governments, for spreading the disease with frank explanations that break down sexual inhibitions. The Islamic council in Kano has urged Muslims to boycott a US-funded seminar on HIV and Aids in Nigeria saying it would encourage promiscuity and so violate sharia law. The council's chairman, Ibrahim Umar Kabo, described the whole issue as a western plot. \"We are disturbed over the social consequences this seminar will bring,\" he said. \"We will not allow the west to use the Aids issue as a gimmick to spread immorality in our society.\" Thousands of people have been killed in religious clashes in Nigeria over the introduction of hardline sharia law in the overwhelmingly Muslim north of the country. The Christian churches have strongly objected to the new codes which in many places reintroduce punishments abolished in the 19th century, including amputations for theft, flogging for pre-marital sex and stoning for adultery. But on the issue of Aids, the Catholic church and Islam see eye to eye. While the Catholic church in most African countries does not officially endorse Aids education or the use of condoms to prevent HIV contamination, in recent years it has generally chosen not to publicly contradict the high profile campaigns against the disease in countries such as Uganda. In many African countries, churches have also played a leading role in providing care and treatment to those dying of Aids, and in supporting the children left behind. In South Africa, the Catholic church has publicly condemned the government for failing to provide anti-retroviral drugs to HIV-positive people. But in several African countries, the church is also increasingly outspoken against attempts to combat the disease. The influential Zambian Catholic church has denounced a new education campaign aimed at young people as promoting \"moral decay\". Zambia's health minister, Enock Kavinele, said he has warned the Catholic church that it risks losing most of its adherents in the country if Aids is not tackled. \"I have told religious leaders that the prospect of preaching to empty churches is very high if we do not deal with Aids firmly,\" he said. Religious leaders are not alone in suspecting western motives in combatting the disease. South Africa' president, Thabo Mbeki, has questioned the motives of international drug companies involved in researching anti-Aids treatments. Other critics have denounced the prohibitively high prices charged for drugs as an attempt by western firms to profit from Africa's suffering.

Foulcher turned up near Narbonne early yesterday at the house of a couple who had testified against him at his trial last April for the murder of an insurance agent near Toulouse in 1993. They called for help and Foulcher machine-gunned two policemen who responded to their call. He then shot dead the husband, then drove to Valras and shot dead another prosecution witness. Several other prosecution witnesses, and the two lawyers who represented Foulcher at his trial last April, have been put under police protection. Foulcher was first arrested in June 1993, six months after the insurance agent was killed. He was released on bail in October 1996 by an appeal court, which ruled that his long pre-trial incarceration violated the European convention of human rights.

      "byline": "Clare Dyer, legal correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The ruling giving Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the killers of James Bulger, blanket protection from media intrusion from the rest of their lives could set a precedent for other notorious criminals to seek similar gagging orders on their release.</p> <p>Desmond Browne, QC for the three national newspaper groups which opposed a permanent injunction, told the judge, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, that it could open the way for the Moors murderer Myra Hindley to ask for a ban on disclosure of her whereabouts and any new identity if she ever wins her freedom. Paedophiles too could invoke the ruling to ward off unwelcome press attention and vigilante attacks, Mr Browne warned.</p> <p>The ruling was a \"historic first\", he pointed out. No adult had ever before won a court order guaranteeing anonymity. The so-called Mary Bell order, the prototype for the injunction granted yesterday, was in fact not granted to protect the child killer but to safeguard her daughter from press attention.</p> <p>Had it not been for the existence of her daughter, the courts would have had no power to protect Mary Bell with a blanket ban on publishing or soliciting details of her new life. Yesterday's ruling could open the way for her to seek a new injunction to preserve her anonymity when her daughter reaches 18 and the current court order expires. She would have to show that her life was in danger from reprisals for her killing of two small boys in 1968 when she was aged 11.</p> <p>She served 12 years before her release and managed to remain out of the public eye till two years ago, when a book by Gitta Sereny, Cries Unheard: Why Children Kill - the Story of Mary Bell, was published and the Sun tracked her down. Some details of her new life found their way into the newspapers and she was given police protection.</p> <p>But Bell is no longer demonised - if she ever was - to anything like the same extent as Venables and Thompson, who abducted two-year-old James Bulger from a Merseyside shopping centre in February 1993, battered him to death and left his body on a railway line. She might not succeed in convincing a judge that publication of her whereabouts would put her life in danger.</p> <p>Myra Hindley, however, still rivals the Bulger killers as an icon of hate. Although successive home secretaries have said that in her case \"life means life\", she is challenging the home secretary's role in setting the tariff for murderers. The lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, predicted two months ago that judges may well remove from the government the right to decide when murderers go free.</p> <p>If that happens, Hindley could be released eventually, on licence, and provided with a new identity by the home office.

      "bodyText": "The ruling giving Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the killers of James Bulger, blanket protection from media intrusion from the rest of their lives could set a precedent for other notorious criminals to seek similar gagging orders on their release. Desmond Browne, QC for the three national newspaper groups which opposed a permanent injunction, told the judge, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, that it could open the way for the Moors murderer Myra Hindley to ask for a ban on disclosure of her whereabouts and any new identity if she ever wins her freedom. Paedophiles too could invoke the ruling to ward off unwelcome press attention and vigilante attacks, Mr Browne warned. The ruling was a \"historic first\", he pointed out. No adult had ever before won a court order guaranteeing anonymity. The so-called Mary Bell order, the prototype for the injunction granted yesterday, was in fact not granted to protect the child killer but to safeguard her daughter from press attention. Had it not been for the existence of her daughter, the courts would have had no power to protect Mary Bell with a blanket ban on publishing or soliciting details of her new life. Yesterday's ruling could open the way for her to seek a new injunction to preserve her anonymity when her daughter reaches 18 and the current court order expires. She would have to show that her life was in danger from reprisals for her killing of two small boys in 1968 when she was aged 11. She served 12 years before her release and managed to remain out of the public eye till two years ago, when a book by Gitta Sereny, Cries Unheard: Why Children Kill - the Story of Mary Bell, was published and the Sun tracked her down. Some details of her new life found their way into the newspapers and she was given police protection. But Bell is no longer demonised - if she ever was - to anything like the same extent as Venables and Thompson, who abducted two-year-old James Bulger from a Merseyside shopping centre in February 1993, battered him to death and left his body on a railway line. She might not succeed in convincing a judge that publication of her whereabouts would put her life in danger. Myra Hindley, however, still rivals the Bulger killers as an icon of hate. Although successive home secretaries have said that in her case \"life means life\", she is challenging the home secretary's role in setting the tariff for murderers. The lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, predicted two months ago that judges may well remove from the government the right to decide when murderers go free. If that happens, Hindley could be released eventually, on licence, and provided with a new identity by the home office. Newspaper articles over the years painting her as a uniquely evil killer who should never be freed could prove, in her case, as convincing evidence of the danger of vigilante attacks as they did in the case of Thompson and Venables. Dame Elizabeth ruled that the court now had jurisdiction to grant an order extending anonymity into adulthood because of the Human Rights Act 1998, which came into force last October, making the European convention on human rights part of UK law. Under article 2 of the convention, the state is obliged to protect an individual's right to life. She had decided that the law may, in exceptional circumstances, be applied to protect individuals who are seriously at risk of injury or death if their identity or whereabouts became public knowledge. Allan Levy QC, who has advised Mary Bell, said: \"This is not a precedent in the sense that it opens the floodgates. But if another case comes along where there is evidence of serious risk to life, then it is likely it will be as persuasive in that case as it has been in this.\" Dame Elizabeth ruled that past information on Thompson and Venables, including the names of the secure units where they spent their time in custody and the rehabilitation regimes they underwent, could be published by the media after a \"cooling off\" period of 12 months.

Instead, they are expected to be resettled somewhere in the north of England, where their accents, and those of their families will be less conspicuous.

Rumsfeld, are likely to dwarf the 100-missile Alaska-based system which was under consideration by the Clinton administration before test failures last summer forced it to pass the issue to its successor's intray.</p> <p>The scale of the Bush team's thinking began to emerge as the president-elect met congressional leaders in Austin, Texas, yesterday to begin mapping out the Republican legislative programme for defence.</p> <p>His three principal campaign commitments on defence were raised at the meeting: a $1bn (\u00a3668m) pay rise for the armed forces, a $20bn boost for hi-tech weapons research, and the NMD system.</p> <p>\"Strengthening the military is one of my top priorities,\" Mr Bush said.</p> <p>He was joined in the discussions by Mr Cheney, who is himself a former defence secretary, Mr Rumsfeld, and his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice.</p> <p>They were attended by eight senior Republicans and six senior Democrats, including the chairmen of key defence-related committees in the Senate and House of Representatives.</p> <p>One notable absentee was General Colin Powell, Mr Bush's choice for secretary of will have the job of selling the NMD plans to America's allies, including Britain, which opposed the Clinton administration's scheme and object to Republican plans to abrogate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia.</p> <p>Diplomats in Washington believe that Mr Powell is advising his colleagues not to plunge into an immediate and detailed commitment to implement NMD, but to remit the whole issue to a commission

      "bodyText": "George W Bush is preparing to commit billions of extra dollars to develop a more elaborate system of national missile defence (NMD) which is certain to sour relations with Russia, China and Europe, and could bind future administrations to the policy. His plans, which are being driven by his vice-president, Dick Cheney, and his nominated defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, are likely to dwarf the 100-missile Alaska-based system which was under consideration by the Clinton administration before test failures last summer forced it to pass the issue to its successor's intray. The scale of the Bush team's thinking began to emerge as the president-elect met congressional leaders in Austin, Texas, yesterday to begin mapping out the Republican legislative programme for defence. His three principal campaign commitments on defence were raised at the meeting: a $1bn (\u00a3668m) pay rise for the armed forces, a $20bn boost for hi-tech weapons research, and the NMD system. \"Strengthening the military is one of my top priorities,\" Mr Bush said. He was joined in the discussions by Mr Cheney, who is himself a former defence secretary, Mr Rumsfeld, and his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. They were attended by eight senior Republicans and six senior Democrats, including the chairmen of key defence-related committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. One notable absentee was General Colin Powell, Mr Bush's choice for secretary of will have the job of selling the NMD plans to America's allies, including Britain, which opposed the Clinton administration's scheme and object to Republican plans to abrogate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia. Diplomats in Washington believe that Mr Powell is advising his colleagues not to plunge into an immediate and detailed commitment to implement NMD, but to remit the whole issue to a commission which could consider all the military, political and spending issues involved in a long-term strategic commitment to missile shields. Mr Powell is a supporter of missile defence, but he is understood not to favour developing a system in response to the dangers posed by North Korea, whose ability to launch missiles ostensibly triggered the current NMD development programme. Rather, he wants NMD to be a long-term strategic cornerstone of US defence strategy, and is anxious not to antagonise world opinion by what might otherwise appear to be a premature and provocative development. Mr Powell may get his way in having the implementation strategy remitted to a commission, but it will be given the job of defining how, not whether, NMD is introduced. Mr Bush's team has not yet said in public how it will build missile defences, but several radical developments are under discussion. All envisage a much bigger system than the Clinton administration's plan. The most important of these are design changes which would shift the NMD strategy from its current land-based launching sites to sea-based and space-based interceptors. \"We need a system that is more robust than what the Clinton administration has designed,\" said Dave Smith, a Republican missile defence expert who served on the 1998 commission chaired by Mr Rumsfeld which persuaded Mr Clinton to go ahead. \"If you want to be more robust you have to go to sea or to space, or to both,\" Mr Smith said. \"The system needs to be global, it needs to be layered, and it needs to have an evolutionary approach.\" The most likely expansion, at least as the first step which Ms Rice supported in remarks during the election campaign last year, would be for sea-based interceptors.

      "bodyText": "After defence lawyers unexpectedly announced yesterday that they would be presenting no more evidence, judges in the Lockerbie trial will decide within days whether the two Libyans in the dock are guilty of the biggest act of mass murder in British history. The defence made its dramatic announcement at the Scottish court in the Netherlands, after giving only two days of submissions during the 77-day trial. This means the crown will give its closing speech at Camp Zeist today, followed immediately by closing speeches by counsel for Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, 48, and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 44. The submissions are expected to last for no more than a couple of days and it is anticipated that the three judges then will take no more than a week to deliver their verdict. After months of evidence, the stop-start trial began its abrupt crescendo yesterday when William Taylor QC, counsel for Megrahi, told the court he intended to call no further witnesses. Mr Taylor had called only a few minor witnesses and it had been expected that he would ask Megrahi to take the stand today to begin a defence which would lay blame for the atrocity at the hands of a conspiracy of Palestinian terrorist organisations. After Mr Taylor sat down, Richard Keen QC, counsel for Fhimah, said he would not be presenting any evidence in defence of his client. The trial reconvened yester day after a one month delay to allow Syria time to respond to a defence request to release a document which claims to reveal who was responsible for the Lockerbie bombing. At the start of the trial last May, Mr Keen and Mr Taylor indicated that the defence would blame the Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, among others, for the attack on Pan Am flight 103. It is understood the document held by the Syrian authorities backed this claim, but the Middle Eastern government has refused to release it. After closing speeches, the trial judges will decide whether Megrahi and Fhimah are guilty of murder, conspiracy to murder and a breach of the 1982 Aviation Security Act. The charges were brought after the exhaustive investigation which followed the destruction of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988, killing all 259 passengers and crew on board and 11 locals on the ground. Libya's refusal to hand over the suspects led to years of sanctions against a country which has always proclaimed it had nothing to do with the destruction of the jet. The prosecution case against the Libyans has been plagued by problems, from witnesses not giving the testimony expected of them, to the star witness, Libyan \"supergrass\" Abdul Majid Giaka, appearing to crumble under cross-examination.

      "body": "<p>Indications that Britain wants to end joint air patrols over southern Iraq should be seen first and foremost by Washington as a warning from London that current US policy towards Saddam Hussein's regime cannot any longer be sensibly sustained or wholly supported. Whitehall may also be sending a message that the tougher, \"re-energised\" line advocated by incoming Bushmen like Colin Powell, if translated into increased military and economic pressure on Iraq, could make a bad situation worse.</p> <p>The Iraq \"policy review\", revealed in yesterday's Guardian and confirmed by Foreign Office officials, is but one move on the special relationship chessboard where the imminent arrival of George W Bush has given rise to a flurry of hasty recalculation. A unilateral US withdrawal from the Balkans, for example, could make it harder, mandarins might hint, to deliver national missile defence facilities in Yorkshire or to rein in the rapid reactionaries of Jacques Chirac's supposedly Nato-busting Euro-army. Labour may justly feel that this new, unabashedly rightwing US administration needs checks as well as balances. In pawn to the US on so many fronts, Britain has few courses to pursue. But given America's isolation on the issue, Iraq is one of them. British support, finally, is no longer unconditional. That is a step forward. Now the onus is on Washington to explain why it remains a useful idea to be blowing up Shia civilians (accidentally, of course) to protect Shia civilian insurgents who long since ceased to surge.</p> <p>There are, in any case, plenty of other persuasive reasons why the RAF's Tornados should turn for home. Southern Watch serves no useful purpose. These flights of futility are symbolic of a failed war and a failed policy of sanctions and intimidation (as we have said many times). They merely obstruct the dialogue necessary for ending the Iraqi people's suffering and gaining re-entry for the UN's exiled weapons inspectors. As Saudi Arabia has reportedly made clear, Britain's solitary role as supporting actor to America's top-gun leading men in the skies over Iraq damages its standing in the Middle East, stokes anti-British hostility and stymies business. It undermines independent British and EU attempts to mediate the Arab-Israeli conflict and foster relations with key states like Iran and Syria. It actually helps Saddam who, careless of his people's lives, welcomes every foolish bomb.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,417226,00.html\">January 3: The great survivor</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,406101,00.html\">December 3 2000: Executioner tells of mass slaughter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4046231,00.html\">August 1 2000: Targeting the tyrant</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/casi/\" target=\"_new\">Campaign against sanctions on Iraq</a><br><a href=\"http://www.undp.org/missions/iraq/\" target=\"_new>Permanent mission of Iraq to the UN</A><BR><A HREF=\" http: www.arab.net iraq history iq_saddam.html\">ArabNet: Invasion of Kuwait</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Indications that Britain wants to end joint air patrols over southern Iraq should be seen first and foremost by Washington as a warning from London that current US policy towards Saddam Hussein's regime cannot any longer be sensibly sustained or wholly supported. Whitehall may also be sending a message that the tougher, \"re-energised\" line advocated by incoming Bushmen like Colin Powell, if translated into increased military and economic pressure on Iraq, could make a bad situation worse. The Iraq \"policy review\", revealed in yesterday's Guardian and confirmed by Foreign Office officials, is but one move on the special relationship chessboard where the imminent arrival of George W Bush has given rise to a flurry of hasty recalculation. A unilateral US withdrawal from the Balkans, for example, could make it harder, mandarins might hint, to deliver national missile defence facilities in Yorkshire or to rein in the rapid reactionaries of Jacques Chirac's supposedly Nato-busting Euro-army. Labour may justly feel that this new, unabashedly rightwing US administration needs checks as well as balances. In pawn to the US on so many fronts, Britain has few courses to pursue. But given America's isolation on the issue, Iraq is one of them. British support, finally, is no longer unconditional. That is a step forward. Now the onus is on Washington to explain why it remains a useful idea to be blowing up Shia civilians (accidentally, of course) to protect Shia civilian insurgents who long since ceased to surge. There are, in any case, plenty of other persuasive reasons why the RAF's Tornados should turn for home. Southern Watch serves no useful purpose. These flights of futility are symbolic of a failed war and a failed policy of sanctions and intimidation (as we have said many times). They merely obstruct the dialogue necessary for ending the Iraqi people's suffering and gaining re-entry for the UN's exiled weapons inspectors. As Saudi Arabia has reportedly made clear, Britain's solitary role as supporting actor to America's top-gun leading men in the skies over Iraq damages its standing in the Middle East, stokes anti-British hostility and stymies business. It undermines independent British and EU attempts to mediate the Arab-Israeli conflict and foster relations with key states like Iran and Syria. It actually helps Saddam who, careless of his people's lives, welcomes every foolish bomb.

Ken Williams, chief constable of Norfolk and chairman of the association of chief police officers road policing committee, said it was \"common sense\" to link the rise, the first in three years, to the chaos. The percentage of motorists who tested positive after crashes rose to 7.18, compared with 6.5% in 1999-00 and 6% the year before. Overall, 1,081 drivers involved in accidents in England and Wales between December 18 and January 2 were over the limit, the highest total for three years. Gwent had the highest proportion of positive tests - 23%. Cambridgeshire had the lowest, 1.9%. Though there has been no in-depth analysis of the figures, Mr Williams said it was highly possible the problems with the rail network, including the cancellation of trains and delays on some of the country's key routes, had forced more people to travel on the roads. \"The turmoil on the rail network may well have been a factor behind the increase in drink-driving.\" He said it was disappointing a series of hard-hitting advertisements had not deterred more people from drinking and driving, and urged the government to consider stiffer sentences for offenders. \"It is clear considerable work remains to be done to target the hard core who continue to put the lives of other road users at risk.

Fearing violence, police sealed off the city opposite Damascus Gate, barring Palestinians from crossing the old green line.</p> <p>Also yesterday, the Israeli army commander in the West Bank city of Hebron confirmed that troops had shot a handcuffed Palestinian man in the leg, claiming that he had tried to escape from their custody.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian national authority</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" target=\"_new&quot;\">White House</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">Interactive history of Israel</a></p>",

However, Israel reaffirmed Mr Barak's acceptance of the proposals. \"We consider his ideas as a basis for the continuation of negotiations,\" said the deputy defence minister, Ephraim Sneh. But for the thousands who converged outside Jaffa Gate, the entrance to the Old City favoured by visitors from Jewish west Jerusalem, the very thought is heresy. Last night's rally was a show of force by the Israeli right - with generous funding from abroad, and participants flown in from the US and Europe. Speakers ruled out any transfer of territory to the Palestinians - even Arab East Jerusalem, which was occupied after 1967, and which few Israelis have ever seen. It was meant to ram home Israel's claims to the Temple of the Mount, revered by Jews as the site of their destroyed biblical-era temple, and by Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, marking the spot where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven. It also promises to give a boost to the election prospects of the hardline leader, Ariel Sharon, who opposes any compromise on Jerusalem. Palestinian religious authorities condemned the rally as a provocation, and the chief cleric, or mufti, of Jerusalem issued a religious edict barring the transfer of any portion of the holy site to the control of non-Muslims. But despite the protesters' insistence on Jerusalem as the \"undivided and eternal capital\" of Israel, the city was effectively partitioned last night on the 1967 lines. Fearing violence, police sealed off the city opposite Damascus Gate, barring Palestinians from crossing the old green line. Also yesterday, the Israeli army commander in the West Bank city of Hebron confirmed that troops had shot a handcuffed Palestinian man in the leg, claiming that he had tried to escape from their custody.

After an interruption, he told her to take her dress off. After the ad break, she said he had raped her. Who did you believe? Essentially, those were the bare bones of the plot, but the fine writing and excellent acting - from Clare Holman as Alison, Paul Rhys as David, and Caroline Quentin as Beth - put muscular meat on those bones.

Co-presenter Lawrence Llewelyn-Bowen was also censured, for using equipment without tying back his luxuriant locks. \"These programmes make DIY look simpler than it is,\" rails the watchdog, \"and have made people take on jobs that are beyond their capabilities.\" Has the Beeb taken up chisels on Andy's behalf? \"The issue of safety is taken very seriously,\" they have retorted, \"in all of the BBC's leisure programmes.\" So should we take RoSPA's advice seriously? Deadly seriously. Their annual home accident report focuses on the threat to human health posed by tin cans and underpants. Never, ever wear them together. There were also, RoSPA points out, 130,000 people hospitalised in carpet-related accidents last year. It's an epidemic. Burn your shagpile (while wearing protective goggles, of course)! So how can Andy patch it up with the accident police? It's thought the handyman might offer to refit some shelves in RoSPA's offices, while his colleagues reimagine the lobby in a pulsating shade of pink. Most likely to say: \"Try this at home.\" Most likely to need: Elastoplast. Not to be confused with: Charles Handy, Carol Smillie, Driller Killer.",

      "bodyText": "New evidence of crimes committed during the rule of Augusto Pinochet, including the dumping of 120 bodies from helicopters into the Pacific, lakes and rivers, has hardened the mood in Chile and made it unlikely that the former dictatorcan secure the amnesty he has been seeking for human rights violations by the armed forces. At the same time he has lost another attempt to get today\u2019s interrogation by the investigating magistrate Judge Juan Guzman delayed. The appeal court rejected it by two to one. If General Pinochet fails to attend and answer Judge Guzman\u2019s questions he can be declared \u201cin rebellion\u201d - similar to contempt of court - and thus liable to arrest. Gen Pinochet, 85, was last seen on Sunday afternoon, hobbling with a cane from his beach home to prayers in his private chapel. Police officers and security guards blocked public access to nearby roads to shield the former commander-in-chief and president from television cameras and passersby. For months Gen Pinochet and his allies have saved dozens of officers from trial by arguing for the revival of the amnesty law his regime introduced in 1978. Those efforts were effectively buried by the new evidence of the atrocities committed under the regime between 1973 and 1990. Gory details of the fate of 180 missing detainees from that time were given by President Ricardo Lagos in a nationally televised speech on Sunday night. He said they were among the 600 people still unaccounted for out of the 3,000 thought to have been the victims of political violence under Pinochet. He said that, thanks to a government-backed forum in which the military, the church and other sections of society were cooperating, he had information about how they had met their end. Of the 180, he said, 120 civilians kidnapped by security forces in the 1970s were tossed from helicopters into \u201cthe ocean, the lakes and the rivers of Chile\u201d. Mr Lagos, a socialist who began his political career by challenging the Pinochet regime in the 1980s, said he had asked the supreme court to review and investigate the new information quickly. The material was ceremoniously placed in a leather satchel and passed to Hernan Alvarez, who heads the supreme court. Mr Lagos made no direct reference to Gen Pinochet in his speech, but the testimony and documents are a blow to the general attempt to revive and shelter behind his regime\u2019s amnesty law. More than 100 officers are under indictment for crimes committed during that period. Further macabre details of summary executions, including the use of dynamite to dismember prisoners, are expected to be released within days. The revelations will set off many further judicial investigations which are likely to involve teams of forensic anthropologists wielding their shovels under the country\u2019s gaze. In his speech, Mr Lagos sur prised commentators by referring to those who disappeared under the dictatorship as \u201cour fellow countrymen\u201d and \u201cchildren of the nation\u201d. It was a remarkable break from the language of past civilian administrations, which buried the dead under the cloak of euphemism or classified them as the unfortunate victims of a fictitious civil war. President Lagos left no doubt about his sentiments, referring to the events as \u201cthis tragic, dark episode of our national history\u201d. Without being specific, he revealed that a \u201cmass grave\u201d containing 20 bodies had been discovered in the capital, Santiago. Further details, he said, would be released after the families of the dead were notified. The president also chastised military and civilian officials who are still withholding information about the death of hundreds of people. \u201cI have not resigned my hopes that their conscience speaks and will help alleviate the pain of many [Chilean families],\u201d he said. But he praised \u201cthe recognition by the armed forces high command, who have accepted that Chile can\u2019t look forward without clearing the debts of the past\u201d. The president of the Family Members of the Detained and Disappeared, Vivianna Diaz, said at the organisation\u2019s office that Mr Lagos had told her privately that her father had been tossed into the sea in the mid-1970s, along with other prominent members of the banned Communist Party of Chile. \u201cAfter fighting for so long to find him, I know tonight that I will not ... To discover that he is in the depths of the ocean is terrible and distressing,\u201d Ms Diaz said with tears rolling down her face. She then told the group that \u201ctogether with him were all his companions who were taken prisoner in May of 1976\u201d. The new evidence of what happened to 180 people came from six-months roundtable discussion in which human rights lawyers, religious leaders and military commanders discussed the systematic violations which began within hours of the 1973 coup that overthrew the elected left-wing government of Salvador Allende and installed Gen Pinochet. For the first time in more than a quarter of a century opposing political forces have been confronting each other in a civilised and orderly way. The army commander, Ricardo Izurieta, has played a crucial role in balancing the army\u2019s present needs - fewer personnel, modern equipment, and a coordinated central command structure - with respect for the old guard, which is loathe to break away from nearly 30 years of lies about the armed forces\u2019 role in mass murder. Ultimately the military chose to divulge the truth, though critics maintain that President Lagos\u2019s government had to toss in a\u00a3480m bone, the purchase last week of a batch of F-16 jets fighters. www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/ pinochet Amnesty International - Pinochet campaign www.fundacionpinochet.cl Pinochet Foundation www.presidencia.cl Chilean Presidency",

The signs were not good. Sales in November were weak - bad weather and the chaos on the trains were blamed for putting people off travelling into city and town centres to buy their presents. </p> <p>Times are hard for the shops on Britain's 1,200 high streets. Over the last 15 years they have lost a large amount of their business to out-of-town supermarkets and shopping centres. They also face the growing threat posed by the internet. </p> <p>Three in 10 households are now linked to the web and before Christmas some people were predicting that internet shopping would hit high street retailers very hard. However, not as many people shopped on the internet as expected, and some online retailers suffered. Only last week, the online toy store, eToys Inc closed down its British business in an effort to stay afloat in the US. </p> <p>So, the internet has a long way to go if it is to become the main way for people to buy things. For most of us, it is still important to be able to go to a shop to see, feel, and bounce on the things we want. But this is not so true of goods such as books or CDs and online sales of these are threatening smaller book and music shops. </p> <p>We are also starting to order more of our \"necessity goods\" (such as food) through our computers, as the big supermarkets go online. Certain services, such as banks and travel agents, are easily available online, so these businesses are starting to vanish from our high streets. </p> <p>This is not the first time in our history that shopping patterns have changed dramatically. Until quite recently, most people lived in small villages, and grew and cooked the things they needed for themselves. Visits to shops were rare. Then came rapid industrialisation in the late 18th century. People flocked to towns and cities for jobs in the new factories. Local shops were now a necessity. How else could people work long hours and still get the food they needed? As there was more money around and more to buy, bigger stores started to appear. </p> <p>Then came cars. Suddenly, it was possible to travel further to shop. This and the fact that many people wanted to leave dirty, crowded city centres to live in suburbs meant we were ready for American shopping styles - supermarkets first, and then out-of-town shopping centres. These places may seem common today, but they are both recent arrivals. The first supermarkets actually had to employ actors to teach customers how to use them. However, these new trends were not so good for the city centres or for their shops, which became increasingly run-down. </p> <p>But towns and cities are still the places where 80% of us live, so it is important that our high streets remain lively. Their focus will have to change. Banks may vanish to be replaced by cafes - places that are as lively at night as they are in the daytime. More shops will offer \"retailainment\" - becoming places to buy things and hang out with friends. Local high streets will also benefit if people start to work more from home. </p> <p>But there will be losers, too. For the 8,750,000 people in the UK living on low incomes, internet shopping will remain out of reach. Also, there will be business casualties. Middle-of-the-road stores, including M&amp;S, are already suffering. Last year, C&amp;A pulled out of Britain, with the loss of 5,000 jobs.

Eminem's songs have attracted strong criticism from people appalled at their violent content directed at women and gay people.

But does this mean that mass media products do not exert powerful influences? Once a song is out there, there is no knowing how people are going to understand it. In interviews, Eminem acknowledges the power he has \"to push his fans' buttons\", but he assumes that they will not take the songs too seriously. Stan suggests Eminem wants to put his more deluded fans straight about the importance they should place on his lyrics. </p> <p>But does the possibility that a song could encourage violence prove the need for censorship?

      "body": "<p><strong>Did you know?</strong><br></p> <p> In 1666 a baker's shop in Pudding Lane in London caught fire. People think the fire started when the baker burned some small cakes he was making. The fire burned for several days. It is called the Great Fire because it destroyed 13,000 houses and 89 churches. It spread across most of London but only 20 people were killed. Afterwards London was rebuilt with safer materials. <br></p> <p>\u0095 This is a recipe for making small cakes like the cakes which people think caused the Great Fire of London.

      "bodyText": "Did you know? In 1666 a baker's shop in Pudding Lane in London caught fire. People think the fire started when the baker burned some small cakes he was making. The fire burned for several days. It is called the Great Fire because it destroyed 13,000 houses and 89 churches. It spread across most of London but only 20 people were killed. Afterwards London was rebuilt with safer materials. \u0095 This is a recipe for making small cakes like the cakes which people think caused the Great Fire of London. The recipe comes from a book written more than 300 years ago by Sir Kenelme Digby. It was printed in 1669, three years after the Great Fire. Sir Kenelme's father was killed for his part in the Gunpowder Plot. Sir Kenelme was the first cook to say that bacon and eggs would be nice for breakfast. What is in it? 1 pound of self-raising flour Half a pound of caster sugar 1 pound of currants Half a pound of butter 3 tablespoons of milk 3 egg yolks A pinch of nutmeg 3 tablespoons of Sack Icing sugar to sprinkle on top 1 kilogram = 2 pounds (approx) How they made the cakes in 1666 This is what Sir Kenelme wrote in his book, which is called \"The Closet of Sir Kenelme Digby Opened\". \"Take one pound of very fine flower, and put to it half a pound of sugar. Add one pound of currants well washed. When your flower is well mixed with the sugar and currants, you must put in it a half a pound of melted butter, three spoonfuls of milk, with the yolks of three new-laid eggs beat with it, some nutmeg; and if you please, three spoonfuls of Sack. \"When you have mixed your paste well, you must put it in a dish by the fire, till it be warm. \"Then make them up in little cakes, and prick them full of holes. Bake them in a quick oven unclosed. Afterwards sprinkle them with sugar. \"The Cakes should be about the bigness of a hand-breadth and thin; of the cise of the Sugar Cakes sold at Barnet.\" Could we make the cakes today? We made them and it was great to find out what cakes tasted like 300 years ago. But first, you have to work out what some of the old words mean. Here is a dictionary to help you understand the recipe. Flower is an old way to spell flour, dryed means dried, and cise means size. Bigness is an old word for size. Sack is an old word for dry Spanish wine (you can just leave this out). Quick is an old word for hot. Sir Kenelme made the cakes in a hot oven, \"unclosed\". If you wanted to cook the cakes today it would be safer to put them in the oven for 15 minutes at 200C - with the door shut! Prick the cakes with a fork, and spread them out on the baking tray because they rise when they cook. You may want to find out more about the fire from The Diary of Samuel Pepys, who was there when London was burning. Curriculum links Primary History Unit 5, Year 2: How do we know about the Great Fire of London? Objectives met by this resource \u0095 It links an event beyond living memory with a person (Sir Kenelme). \u0095 It develops a sense of chronology with references to the earlier Gunpowder Plot, the Great Fire, and the publication of the book. \u0095 Children consider why the Great Fire happened. Lesson ideas For discussion: did the cakes cause the fire; does baking in 1666 sound riskier than today? Write a baker's diary (less confident writers could describe making the cakes).

Prof Wyse and her colleagues believe this marriage made in the heavens must have left behind tell-tale evidence of marital strife. \"Just as tidal interactions between the moon and the earth cause distortions, there are going to be tidal interactions as a satellite galaxy comes into the Milky Way. Those can be severe enough to tear mass off the outer parts of the satellite galaxy,\" Prof Wyse said. \"Those stars should be left on an orbit similar to the orbit of the satellite galaxy at that time.\" \u0095 Astronomers have found evidence of massive starbursts which have blown huge holes in distant galaxies. These \"Swiss cheese\" galaxies contain spherical regions 10 million billion miles across, where exploding stars have blown a hole in the gaseous cloud between the stars. \"The energy released by the dying stars in those moments is equivalent to the output of 10,000 suns over their entire 10bn year lifetimes,\" Jane Charlton of Pennsylvania State University told the San Francisco meeting yesterday.",

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan police yesterday confirmed it was investigating allegations that members of a Ukrainian SS division responsible for a string of atrocities during the second world war are living in Britain. According to an ITV documentary as many as 8,000 members of the notorious Galizien Waffen SS division were allowed into Britain in 1947 without having their wartime activities properly investigated. Many of the men subsequently emigrated to Canada and Australia, but the programme makers estimate that as many as 1,500 are alive and well in Britain today. Yesterday a spokesman for the Met confirmed the force was looking into the matter, but refused to specify if it was investigating any particular individuals. \"We can confirm that the Metropolitan police has received a number of allegations which were recently passed to us by the Home Office,\" the spokesman said. The spokesman said the matter had been passed to the anti-terrorist squad, which has taken over the role of the now disbanded war crimes unit. Lord Janner, of the all-party parliamentary war crimes group, said the Home Office should set up an immediate inquiry into how members of the unit were allowed into Britain in the first place. \"If there is sufficient evidence against individuals, it should be put before a jury so that these men can receive the justice that they denied to their victims.\" The programme, broadcast on Sunday, revealed how members of the Nightingale battalion, a Ukrainian police unit which later joined the SS Galizien division, took part in the mass murder of thousands of Jews in Lvov in June 1941. Galizien troops also murdered more than 800 Polish civilians in the village of Huta Pieniacka in February 1944, and killed 44 unarmed civilians, including children, in the village of Chlaniov in August of the same year. Members of the Ukrainian Self Defence Legion, another unit which later merged with the division, suppressed the Warsaw uprising in autumn 1944. Some of the men now living in the UK helped capture downed British and American airmen, who were then handed over to the Gestapo, the programme, made by Yorkshire Television, claimed.",

Mr Mandelson denied he was issuing an ultimatum but said it was his duty to advise parties when they were endangering the process by taking an absolutist position. Sinn Fein is also dissatisfied with the new policing arrangements, but the SDLP denied a hint by Mr Mandelson that its stance might be influenced by the looming general election. \"It would be terrible at this stage for the sake of some relatively small issues, or for the sake of politics and the shadow of a coming election if we were to let this enormous prize (on policing) slip from our grasp,\" he said. \"It would be a torpedo through the peace process and I don't think anyone would want to bear responsibility for that.\" However, the SDLP policing spokesman, Alex Attwood, said there were still substantive matters on which his party wanted guarantees before it could take its seats on the board or recommend Roman Catholics join the service.

Belfast high court is expected to rule soon on the Sinn Fein challenge to Mr Trimble's ban on its ministers, Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Bruin, attending cross-border meetings due to the IRA's failure to engage seriously with General John de Chastelain's disarmament body. Ulster Unionist party officers will meet in Belfast on Friday to discuss the situation and a meeting of the 100-strong policy-making executive or the full 860-strong ruling council will almost certainly be convened in the next few weeks and asked to vote on withdrawal from Stormont.

The woman who has made a string of accusations against Mr Fischer, Bettina R\u00f6hl, announced that she was pressing for him to be investigated on suspicion of attempted murder. Ms R\u00f6hl, the daughter of the late Ulrike Meinhof, co-leader of the terrorist Baader-Meinhof gang, claimed that Mr Fischer was the key figure behind the use of molotov cocktails in a 1976 demonstration in which a policeman almost died. Speaking in Hanover, Mr Schr\u00f6der said his most popular minister had never concealed what he had done in his youth. And he had shown in government that he was a \"really good representative\" of Germany. The chancellor offered his backing just over a week before Mr Fischer is due to testify in Frankfurt at the trial of a friend from his days on the far left. Hans-Joachim Klein is charged with taking part in the 1975 raid on an Opec oil ministers' conference in which three people were killed. He has denied having any sympathy for terrorism and he said he was shocked to discover his friend had played a part in the raid. This is why the latest allegation against him is potentially explosive. Ms R\u00f6hl claims that, a year after the Opec raid, Mr Fischer was still a central figure in organising potentially lethal activities. A police officer nearly died of his injuries after being set alight by a molotov cocktail during the 1976 demonstration which was called to protest at the death of Ms R\u00f6hl's mother. In an open letter to President Johannes Rau, Ms R\u00f6hl said she had written to the public prosecutor in Frankfurt urging him to bring attempted murder charges against Mr Fischer. \"On the basis of all the known facts, I have drawn the conclusion that Josef Martin Fischer was par excellence the leading figure in the violent group [at the centre of the demonstration] and also effectively helped to set up violent groups acting in parallel,\" she said. Mr Fischer, who was arrested but released after the clash, has denied throwing fire bombs or proposing their use. Ms R\u00f6hl, who is soon to publish a book on the radical left in the 1970s, claims that he argued for the use of molotov cocktails at a meeting the day before the demonstration. Horst Breunig, one of the three policemen on the receiving end of the fire attack, said: \"As far as I am concerned it was a deadly attack on our lives, and for that there is no statute of limitations.\" Mr Fischer's past was brought vividly to life last week with the publication of photographs, discovered by Ms R\u00f6hl, showing him beating a fallen policeman during a 1973 protest.

      "bodyText": "Tory-turned-Labour MP Shaun Woodward is searching for a new Westminster constituency after party officials agreed to exempt him from Labour's \"chicken run\" ban. The former Conservative frontbench spokesman, successfully wooed by Tony Blair in December 1999, disclosed in an interview with the Guardian that he hopes to stand again at the election despite announcing he will step down in Witney, Oxfordshire. Mr Woodward, earmarked for a prominent role in the party's campaign to persuade middle Britain and Tory converts in 1997 to stick with Mr Blair, said he wants to \"play a role\" in the government's expected second term. \"Although I would dearly love to play that role in Westminster, that realistically might not happen. But my ambition for the Labour party is greater than my ambition for myself,\" said Mr Woodward. His comments will fuel speculation that Downing Street is planning to parachute the 42-year-old recruit into a safe Labour seat at the start of a short election campaign, creating a vacancy by sending a sitting MP to the House of Lords. Millbank is believed to have identified as many as 25 constituencies where reselected stalwarts could be tempted to retire. Another option for Mr Blair would be to send Mr Woodward to the Lords and make him a minister while the MP, who will make a final decision next month, is considering his own options, including the possibility of a post with an international body such as the United Nations or charity like the Red Cross. But Mr Woodward, who gave up a Tory seat-for-life and party post as well as political friendships to join Labour, made it clear he would prefer to stay in the Commons. \"I received no promises when I joined the Labour party,\" he said. \"Clearly it will depend on a constituency wanting me. These things are as much in the hands of the gods as they have ever been in my life.\" The MP announced shortly before Christmas he would not run again in Witney, a seat where his 7,028 majority for the Tories in 1997 puts it out of Labour's reach. Labour has banned MPs in marginal seats following what the party four years ago dubbed the \"chicken run\" when Tories abandoned marginal constituencies for safer berths but Mr Woodward is considered a special case after he switched parties. Downing Street officials have also argued that Labour has a \"debt of hounour\" to fulfil and a seat must be found to have any chance of persuading other Tories to defect if William Hague loses heavily and the Conservatives lurch further to the right. Mr Woodward's defection 13 months ago was a spectacular coup for Labour and a bitter blow for William Hague, with Tories launching a personal smear campaign, including the \"outing\" of Lesley, born his brother and now his sister after a sex change who suffered the full tabloid treatment. He is now one of Labour's most active backbenchers, visiting constituencies as far apart as Falmouth and Dover, Preston and Newcastle to offer his inside knowledge to highlight the dangers posed by the Conservatives. Mr Woodward, who joined the Tories in 1989, crossed the floor after being attracted by Mr Blair's centrist brand of New Labour and repelled by Mr Hague's shift to the right, finally jumping over the Tory leader's backing of the anti-gay section 28. The Tories will make sure every Labour constituency party is aware that he married into the incredibly wealthy Sainsbury family and lives on a huge estate. At meetings, Mr Woodward, a trustee of the Childline charity after working for founder Esther Rantzen on That's Life, points out his father worked in a department store and his mother was a barmaid before adding, in a Kinnockite touch: \"If you run the tapes back, I'm the first kid in my family to go to university.\" Insisting if he was as ambitious as Tories make out he would never have given up a safe seat, he acknowledges that some colleagues question his commitment to the people's party. The suspicions were illustrated soon after his defection when, with wife Camilla, he went into Westminster's clubby Strangers' Bar and asked a group of Labour MPs: \"Would you chaps like a drink?\" One present recalled: \"It was as if he'd popped downstairs to see the staff\", yet another MP insisted: \"It wasn't like that at all.

Peter Temple-Morris, who has also swapped the Tories for Labour since 1997, is to stand down in Leominster. Mr Woodward said: \"The response of the Labour party has been infinitely kind, more generous than I could have hoped for.

Recent attacks on the Tories, including branding his former party \"instinctive racists\", provoked intense counter-attacks from his ex-colleagues. Julian Lewis, the rightwing Conservative MP for New Forest East who worked with Mr Woodward in Tory HQ during the 1992 election campaign, said: \"The impression that I formed at the time was Shaun was very much Chris Patten's right hand man in the central office campaign. \"The bit where it makes the cat sick is when Shaun Woodward starts comparing himself with Winston Churchill and crossing the floor.

The manufacturing sector as a whole lost 54,000 jobs in December and companies have already exceeded that figure in January. Retailers did badly over Christmas, and last week the Montgomery Ward department stores went into liquidation after 120 years as a high street business. Economists are still struggling to interpret all the signs. All are agreed there is a slow down. But opinions differ as to whether recession is on the way, while only a handful of observers predict anything approaching a market crash. \"An honest but unhelpful answer is that nobody knows. A more detailed but equally unhelpful answer is that it's possible to make a case either way. But on the whole I'd vote for panic,\" says the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor Paul Krugman in his weekly New York Times column.",

Launching a drive against domestic violence, senior officers proposed a similar scheme to that in Cyprus, where dedicated courts deal with cases from assault to child custody and divorce.

Sheryl Gascoigne, the former wife of footballer Paul Gascoigne, and stars including actor Lynda Bellingham and journalist Kate Adie attended the launch at the Globe theatre in London. The scheme aims to make violent partners face up to their crimes by encouraging victims to come forward. As well as a London-wide television and radio campaign, posters will be distributed around the capital's doctors' surgeries, libraries and hospitals encouraging victims to contact their local community safety unit for help. The units, set up in every London borough in June 1999, provide services for victims of \"hate crimes\" such as racist, domestic and homophobic attacks. Ms Gascoigne, who had a violent eight-year relationship with her former husband Paul, has been a long-standing campaigner with Refuge against violence in the home. Her suffering became public when the footballer broke two of her fingers and gave her a black eye. Lynda Bellingham, who starred in the Oxo television commercials, and helped publicise the force's Enough is Enough domestic violence conference last year, said in October that she had been mentally and physically abused by her ex-husband Nunzio Peluso for years.

      "bodyText": "Tough new security checks are to be imposed at nuclear power stations after a guard employed to protect a complex attempted to sabotage the site's computers. The patrolman triggered a high-level security alert that led to a shutdown of the station's automatic access control system, locking doors electronically to effectively close it, as colleagues started searching for an intruder. Leaked documents obtained by the Guardian show that the guard had never been vetted and had two undisclosed criminal convictions. Internal Department of Trade and Industry memos marked \"restricted\" reveal that as a result all security staff, including existing employees, will from March be required to undergo security tests. Written by Peter Hatton, head of security in the government's office for civil nuclear security, the documents refer to a security breach at an unnamed station which was the \"deliberate action of a member of the site security force\". No details are divulged but the station is understood to be the Bradwell magnox reactor in Essex, run by state-owned BNFL and the nearest nuclear power generator to London. The guard is believed to have hacked into Bradwell's computer system to alter sensitive information. \"He got into one of the systems and wiped the records. The security people are still very touchy when we try to find out exactly what happened,\" said an industry employee. BNFL said last night it was unable to provide further information but the incident, in June 1999, which was never disclosed nationally, was considered so serious that a working party was formed to review security. Mr Hatton says in his memo: \"The incident did highlight the danger of not conducting retrospective vetting particularly of those individuals such as members of the security police force who enjoy a freedom of movement over the whole of a site and have a high degree of trust placed in their integrity.\" From March this year more than 500 guards, including hundreds of existing personnel, will be subjected to 10-yearly tests including security service, court and credit clearance, and taking up references. New recruits have since April 1998 been required to undergo less stringent checks but employees in post before that date, including the Bradwell guard, were not covered. The guard's two criminal convictions would not necessarily have led to clearance being denied, records the DTI note. Jack Dromey, who represents security staff as national secretary of the Transport &amp; General Workers Union, said: \"Employers have a duty not to put the public and fellow employees at risk by penny-pinching or through sloppy procedures.\" Another union official said: \"Lunatics, industrial spies or terrorists could have walked through the gates with a badge that almost anyone could get.\" The new security tests will apply to British Energy civilian security staff at Dungeness B, Hartlepool, Hinkley B, Sizewell B, Hunterston, Torness and two Heysham power stations, plus BNFL magnox employees at Oldbury, Wylfa, Dungeness A, Sizewell A, Hinckley Point A, Berkeley and Bradwell. A spokesman for British Energy said: \"We understand the need for such arrangements and are happy to comply.\" The department of trade and industry confirmed the new checks but played down the Bradwell incident, saying security was constantly under review. \"There has been an incident in 1999 which, although it did not cause a breach of security, caused a review of security and in the light of that review revised procedures are to be introduced,\" a spokesman said. The bigger security companies, MPs and trade unionists have campaigned against \"cowboy\" guards for years. The government has published a bill requiring the 250,000 guards, bouncers, wheelclampers and private investigators working in the security industry to be vetted after a significant minority were found to have criminal convictions.",

      "body": "<p>It could be harder than flogging brushes or encyclopaedias. But for anyone whose skin tingles at the challenge of the cold-call, the latest import from the US looks worth a go. </p> <p>It's selling training to bosses and it's simple in theory. \"Brokers\" with business experience knock on firms' doors and try to talk employers into the wisdom of forking out to boost the literacy, numeracy and other basic skills of their workforces. For every new lead they generate, the brokers are paid \u00a3200-300. </p> <p>Alan Wells, director of the Basic Skills Agency, saw the scheme working in Virginia and thought it was worth bringing back to try over here. He and his colleagues feel it might bridge the crucial gap between employers sensing that they ought to get their employees some training and actually taking action. </p> <p>This could be one of the bold, innovatory solutions called for in the Moser Report, A Fresh Start, which reckoned that a fifth of adults in England have poor basic skills and can't, for instance, find a plumber in the Yellow Pages. </p> <p>A key barrier to expanding basic skills education in the workplace is the absence of a suitable programme. Employers may identify the need for training but have no idea how to set about providing it. </p> <p>The Virginian programme is managed and co-ordinated by James Madison University and funded by the Virginia state government.

      "bodyText": "It could be harder than flogging brushes or encyclopaedias. But for anyone whose skin tingles at the challenge of the cold-call, the latest import from the US looks worth a go. It's selling training to bosses and it's simple in theory. \"Brokers\" with business experience knock on firms' doors and try to talk employers into the wisdom of forking out to boost the literacy, numeracy and other basic skills of their workforces. For every new lead they generate, the brokers are paid \u00a3200-300. Alan Wells, director of the Basic Skills Agency, saw the scheme working in Virginia and thought it was worth bringing back to try over here. He and his colleagues feel it might bridge the crucial gap between employers sensing that they ought to get their employees some training and actually taking action. This could be one of the bold, innovatory solutions called for in the Moser Report, A Fresh Start, which reckoned that a fifth of adults in England have poor basic skills and can't, for instance, find a plumber in the Yellow Pages. A key barrier to expanding basic skills education in the workplace is the absence of a suitable programme. Employers may identify the need for training but have no idea how to set about providing it. The Virginian programme is managed and co-ordinated by James Madison University and funded by the Virginia state government. The Basic Skills Agency has set up its own pilot scheme in West London in partnership with the CBI, TUC and Ufi. Dawn Walker, the agency field officer who has been setting up the pilot projects, says that in the past it has often been difficult to persuade employers to recognise that working routines might be improved if employees' basic skills were improved. The west London pilot involved finding potential brokers \"with a business background and then training them.

Basic Skills Agency-approved post-16 training providers, such as further education colleges, were also given training to adapt their training provision to the needs of the workplace. And the agency secured funding from the Department for Education and Employment to finance programmes of customised training in the workplace. In west London 13 brokers were trained and some 15 workplace projects have been established in organisations as diverse as Lufthansa and the French Croissant Company. \"There have been tremendous benefits,\" Ms Walker says. \"The change in the workforces of those organisations who participated has been incredible. \"There is a bakery, La Fornaia, near Southall which wanted to work towards Investors in People status.

Walter Friedman, an American psychotherapist working in the Harley St area, has been running Britain's only shyness clinic for nearly three years and yet, despite having helped hundreds of people in that time, he is unwilling to put me in contact with any of his patients. </p> <p>\"You have to understand, John,\" he says, \"that the very nature of the condition makes people extremely reluctant to come forward.\" </p> <p>\"Even if they can remain anonymous?\" \"Even then.\" </p> <p>The idea that people who have been successfully treated for shyness might still be unable to face talking over the phone has an intrinsic comedic quality, but it also masks a more serious edge. Friedman believes that shyness, or social anxiety is one of this country's most undiagnosed or misdiagnosed psychological problems, as well as being one of the least discussed, which makes it particularly difficult and embarrassing for chronic sufferers to talk about. </p> <p>We all suffer from varying degrees of shyness in certain situations, but for those with severe shyness the condition can infect all areas of their life.

But others find they are becoming increasingly isolated; their circle of friends is decreasing and they experience difficulties with dating. A significant number also feel their shyness is impeding their professional development; many of those who come to me find they become highly anxious at departmental meetings and are too nervous to contribute to the discussion.\" </p> <p>What causes someone to become chronically shy is not wholly clear; some believe that shy people may be born with a more sensitive nervous system and be more prone to social anxiety as a result. However, it is also widely accepted that life circumstances play their part; those who are brought up in a nurturing environment may find their shyness mitigated and Friedman also reports that some of his patients have said that shyness was never a problem until they were bullied or shamed at secondary school. Shyness is certainly no respecter of the sexes, though Friedman's clinic tends to attract slightly more men than women. </p> <p>Friedman himself suffered from shyness in his teens and 20s, which he only came to terms with after several years of therapy. After training as a therapist himself he was keen to work within this neglected area and to offer help that could be measured in months rather than years. His clinics consist of 20 two-hour sessions held on a weekly basis in groups of eight to 10 people. All those who contact him receive a one-to-one consultation. \"Not everyone is suitable for the groups,\" he says. \"Some may have more primary problems, such as depression, while others may be so socially anxious that they cannot function within the group. In both instances, I recommend the appropriate treatment, either with me or another professional.\" </p> <p>Once accepted on the course, patients are taught cognitive therapy techniques where they learn appropriate behavioural responses. \"We teach breathing, visualisation, body language and assertiveness,\" he continues, \"as well as providing a safe environment to hold conversations and improve their communication skills.\" As important as the work within the group, is the homework. Which may take place in the pub; Friedman's clinic is one of the few psychotherapeutic groups where members are actively encouraged to fraternise with each other. </p> <p>At \u00a340 a session, Friedman does not come cheap.

In both instances, I recommend the appropriate treatment, either with me or another professional.\" Once accepted on the course, patients are taught cognitive therapy techniques where they learn appropriate behavioural responses. \"We teach breathing, visualisation, body language and assertiveness,\" he continues, \"as well as providing a safe environment to hold conversations and improve their communication skills.\" As important as the work within the group, is the homework. Which may take place in the pub; Friedman's clinic is one of the few psychotherapeutic groups where members are actively encouraged to fraternise with each other. At \u00a340 a session, Friedman does not come cheap. But there again \u00a3800 to cure a condition that has dogged you for 20 years could well seem like a bargain at twice the price. \u0095 Walter Friedman can be contacted on 07979 856188 or at www.shyclinic.com",

It might be simply being able to say: I'd like two beers and a croissant.\"",

      "bodyText": "Railtrack placed a ban on rail supplies from Italy after the discovery of scarring on a \"rogue batch\" of rail which was being laid in two separate 600ft sections in south London, it emerged yesterday. The batch, which was removed, formed part of a consignment of 10 miles of track manufactured by the Italian company Lucchini. Railtrack said last night that it had imposed an immediate embargo on further supplies. Railtrack said that the fault was discovered before the Hatfield rail crash last October. It added the defect would not have been a threat to safety but would have affected the quality of the ride. It said that it hoped the embargo would soon be lifted but that it would not take any chances over rail quality. A senior Railtrack engineer is due to visit Lucchini this month to check on progress. Railtrack said that the fault was not connected with gauge corner cracking, the incident largely responsible for the Hatfield crash. The scarring occurred be cause the finishing at Lucchini was not up to standard. This is not the first time Railtrack has been forced to send back a shipment to its suppliers, although it is the first incident with Lucchini, which signed a contract with Railtrack last May. Research commissioned by Railtrack said that it might take up to five years for the industry to recover from the consequences of the Hatfield crash. The report, compiled by Mori for Railtrack, said that \"lasting and irreparable harm\" might have been caused by the crash. The rail passengers' council said that the report was \"very, very worrying\" and showed that train companies still had a big hill to climb. The findings came on the day when some unregulated fares rose above the level of inflation, a move condemned as \"barmy\" by Gwyneth Dunwoody, chairwoman of the House of Commons transport select committee.",

Aston Martin was one of Britain's most hallowed companies, but, although it had for years been making wonderful cars, it never made any money. The tractor tycoon David Brown, who built the famous DB range - the preferred transport of the Prince of Wales and James Bond - had sold the company in 1972 after 25 years, after which it fell on hard times until taken over by Pace Petroleum's charismatic Victor Gauntlett, backed by the Greek Livanos shipping dynasty.</p> <p>But even Gauntlett had to seek assistance elsewhere, and Hayes played a significant part in this. He had met Gauntlett socially, and learnt that Aston Martin was seeking additional capital to develop a new car. The deal was agreed that July, shortly before Ford's death, and his company acquired a 75% shareholding. Two years later, Hayes retired from Ford, but was appointed a director of Aston Martin; in 1991, he became executive chairman.</p> <p>A great enthusiast, he was a natural choice to run Aston Martin and, with his knowledge of the Ford organisation - which, from 1989, also included Jaguar - he pulled the strings which got the new DB7 introduced in 1993. This car made good use of selected Jaguar components, and was built at Tom Walkinshaw's Jaguar Sport factory at Bloxham.</p> <p>With guidance and encouragement from Hayes, the new car was styled by Ian Callum, who later became Jaguar's director of design. As a small and slightly more affordable Aston Martin, it broke new ground, but could also be seen as the modern successor to the classic DB2 and DB4 models. Hayes astutely linked it to Aston's heritage by giving it the DB tag, after Sir David Brown, whom Hayes persuaded to accept the position of honorary life president until his death in 1993. The title passed to Hayes himself on his retirement in 1994.</p> <p>Born in Harrow, Middlesex, Hayes went to Hampton grammar school before joining the RAF as a cadet pilot in 1943. After the war he turned to journalism, and, in 1956, became the youngest-ever editor-in-chief of a national newspaper, the Daily Mail's then sister, the Sunday Dispatch. During his tenure, he formed a friendship with Colin Chapman, of Lotus, who wrote a motoring column for him.</p> <p>Later, Hayes was associate editor of the Daily Mail, but became head of Ford's public affairs department in 1962, the year the Cortina was launched. He had the inspiration of creating sporting versions of this family car, and first thought up a GT version; the name was chosen because Halfords had a nice-looking GT badge in stock.</p> <p>Next, he got in touch with Chapman, and the two men came up with the Lotus Cortina, using the Ford-based, Lotus twin-cam engine. As a race and rally car, it was the start of a motoring legend; a Lotus Cortina won the 1966 RAC rally. By 1965, Hayes had become a board director of Ford, and, while his main responsibility remained public affairs, he was also involved with Ford Advanced Vehicles, the subsidiary set up to build the GT40 racing car, which, after a hesitant start, went on to win the Le Mans 24-hour race four years in a row from 1966.</p> <p>In 1965, Hayes persuaded Ford to spend \u00a3100,000 backing the development of the Cosworth three-litre V8 engine for the new grand prix formula. The engine, first supplied to Chapman of Lotus, eventually powered most grand prix cars and became the most successful in the history of the race, with 175 wins over 30 years.</p> <p>That the Ford Escort, introduced as the first European Ford car in 1968, became so successful in rallying was also, in no small measure, due to Hayes. Conspiring with competitions manager Henry Taylor, he got approval for a last-minute addition to the range, the Escort twin-cam. The car won the World Rally Championship in 1968 and 1969 - effectively taking over where the Mini Cooper had left off - and firmly established Ford's reputation as a manufacturer of sporting cars.</p> <p>Ford in Britain had now become part of Ford of Europe, and, in 1976, Hayes's responsibilities were extended when he became a vice-chairman. From 1980 to 1984, he was vice-president for world public affairs in Detroit, where his friendship with Henry Ford II developed. Three years after Ford's death, Hayes published Henry: A Memoir Of Henry Ford II.</p> <p>Shrewd, independent-minded and pragmatic, Hayes was never completely the corporate man, and perhaps it was this slightly maverick approach that made him successful at Ford. He was a cultured man of wide interests. A trustee of the National Motor Museum and the Aston Martin Heritage Trust, he also chaired the Stowe Garden Appeal for the National Trust, and the Churches Conservation Trust. His publications included poems and a children's story.</p> <p>He was made a CBE in 1980. His wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Holland) survives him, together with their two sons and daughter.</p> <p><b> Anders Ditlev Clausager</b></p> <p>\u0095 Walter Leopold Arthur Hayes, editor and motor industry executive, born April 12 1924; died December 26 2000</p>",

Next, he got in touch with Chapman, and the two men came up with the Lotus Cortina, using the Ford-based, Lotus twin-cam engine. As a race and rally car, it was the start of a motoring legend; a Lotus Cortina won the 1966 RAC rally. By 1965, Hayes had become a board director of Ford, and, while his main responsibility remained public affairs, he was also involved with Ford Advanced Vehicles, the subsidiary set up to build the GT40 racing car, which, after a hesitant start, went on to win the Le Mans 24-hour race four years in a row from 1966. In 1965, Hayes persuaded Ford to spend \u00a3100,000 backing the development of the Cosworth three-litre V8 engine for the new grand prix formula. The engine, first supplied to Chapman of Lotus, eventually powered most grand prix cars and became the most successful in the history of the race, with 175 wins over 30 years. That the Ford Escort, introduced as the first European Ford car in 1968, became so successful in rallying was also, in no small measure, due to Hayes. Conspiring with competitions manager Henry Taylor, he got approval for a last-minute addition to the range, the Escort twin-cam. The car won the World Rally Championship in 1968 and 1969 - effectively taking over where the Mini Cooper had left off - and firmly established Ford's reputation as a manufacturer of sporting cars. Ford in Britain had now become part of Ford of Europe, and, in 1976, Hayes's responsibilities were extended when he became a vice-chairman. From 1980 to 1984, he was vice-president for world public affairs in Detroit, where his friendship with Henry Ford II developed. Three years after Ford's death, Hayes published Henry: A Memoir Of Henry Ford II. Shrewd, independent-minded and pragmatic, Hayes was never completely the corporate man, and perhaps it was this slightly maverick approach that made him successful at Ford. He was a cultured man of wide interests. A trustee of the National Motor Museum and the Aston Martin Heritage Trust, he also chaired the Stowe Garden Appeal for the National Trust, and the Churches Conservation Trust. His publications included poems and a children's story. He was made a CBE in 1980. His wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Holland) survives him, together with their two sons and daughter.

      "byline": "Ben Marshall",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In Britain the constituency for self-help is mercifully small, mostly made up of wildly insecure pop stars and Bridget Jones-style divorcees. In America, however, if you really want to help yourself, you write a book nominally designed to help others. Self-help manuals are a multi-million dollar industry in the US. Thus Channel 4's decision to get a few amiable British guinea pigs to road-test some of the best-selling American titles is a good one. </p> <p>I should point out at this stage that the only book I have ever put to a practical test is Luke Rhinehart's novel, The Dice Man, in which the protagonist makes major life decisions based on the outcome of the roll of a dice. For me, it resulted in a brief bout of heroin abuse and the loss of my job. The series Living By The Book, though, opens by trying out an ostensibly more constructive book, The Rules, the dating manual for women. But if the programme is anything to go by, The Rules' influence is just as pernicious as Rhinehart's fiction. </p> <p>Basically, it consists of 35 instructions that, its authors emphasise, cannot be cherry-picked and must be followed to the letter. Here are a few choice examples: \"Never accept a Saturday-night date after Wednesday\", \"Never let a phone call last longer than 10 minutes\", \"Always end the phone call yourself\", and \"Be a creature unlike any other.\" This last one, elusive to say the least, involves moving around the room \"like a movie star\" until men \"flock to your side\". Like all the other rules in The Rules it obviously works best if you look like a movie star, or better still are one. </p> <p>Playing hard to get is all very well, but its success does largely depend upon the fact that people want you in the first place.

      "bodyText": "In Britain the constituency for self-help is mercifully small, mostly made up of wildly insecure pop stars and Bridget Jones-style divorcees. In America, however, if you really want to help yourself, you write a book nominally designed to help others. Self-help manuals are a multi-million dollar industry in the US. Thus Channel 4's decision to get a few amiable British guinea pigs to road-test some of the best-selling American titles is a good one. I should point out at this stage that the only book I have ever put to a practical test is Luke Rhinehart's novel, The Dice Man, in which the protagonist makes major life decisions based on the outcome of the roll of a dice. For me, it resulted in a brief bout of heroin abuse and the loss of my job. The series Living By The Book, though, opens by trying out an ostensibly more constructive book, The Rules, the dating manual for women. But if the programme is anything to go by, The Rules' influence is just as pernicious as Rhinehart's fiction. Basically, it consists of 35 instructions that, its authors emphasise, cannot be cherry-picked and must be followed to the letter. Here are a few choice examples: \"Never accept a Saturday-night date after Wednesday\", \"Never let a phone call last longer than 10 minutes\", \"Always end the phone call yourself\", and \"Be a creature unlike any other.\" This last one, elusive to say the least, involves moving around the room \"like a movie star\" until men \"flock to your side\". Like all the other rules in The Rules it obviously works best if you look like a movie star, or better still are one. Playing hard to get is all very well, but its success does largely depend upon the fact that people want you in the first place. However, the book's authors, Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider, like to pretend that their book will work as well for an Ann Widdecombe as it might do for a Julia Roberts. As the two writers watch the Brits putting their book into practice they provide a weird, cruelly critical running commentary on everything the girls are getting wrong. These sentiments, expressed by Ellen and Sherrie with a mixture of half-baked, homespun whimsy and barely contained fury, lead you to suspect that if the Doris Day Fan Club has a paramilitary wing they are it.

      "body": "<p>On the face of it, it's an unbeatable combination. Take the two main focuses of male desire and obsession - sport and girls - and package them as that very modern commodity, the female sports presenter. And these days she is unavoidable. Gabby Yorath fronts ITV's football coverage, Kelly Dalglish and Kirsty Gallacher take the field for Sky, while at the BBC, Sue Barker long ago transcended such piffling issues as gender to become the reigning monarch of televised sport.</p> <p>Even rugby, the boys' last bastion, is not exempt from the onward march of the monstrous regiment. The latest face of the sport is Kathleen Wood, a former Sky sports reporter currently on the showbiz beat for GMTV. On Saturday, she will start fronting Scotsport Rugby Roundup, STV's new weekly show on Scottish rugby, which she hopes will boost the flagging spirits of the sport.</p> <p>While Kirsty Gallacher famously posed for Maxim magazine last month, one can assume there's little chance of Wood appearing minimally clad in the pages of a lads mag, especially not in the foreseeable future as she is eight months pregnant. When she heard the job was up for grabs three weeks ago, she had just begun maternity leave from GMTV. \"I thought, damn, what bad timing. But when I spoke to the people at STV, they said, yeah, yeah, it's the most natural thing in the world. It was pats on the back and good on you, you've got the balls to do it.\"</p> <p>In fact, \"ballsy\" is the word that springs to mind when you think of Wood.

Wood is not completely convinced. \"Listening to a girl commentate is a bit difficult. Sport is a man's world still. You just don't get the mad following in female sport, though times are changing. I think it's the masculinity - men have all the testosterone. I much prefer to watch men play. When you see top level rugby, it's terrific - you see women play and it grates a wee bit. And I play it.\"</p> <p>Oldroyd makes a similar distinction. \"It depends on your role. I suspect having Kirsty or Kelly presenting is less threatening than a woman going to report. Women are OK as long as they're not giving an opinion. But I think the resistance is dwindling.\"</p> <p>What of the future? Scottish TV have signed Wood until April; in August she heads back to GMTV. Meanwhile, Oldroyd thinks the fad for employing women in sport just because they're female has passed. \"Four years ago, it was a way of getting into TV presenting and a number of the girls who were prominent then have gone on to do other things in TV, but not sport.

      "bodyText": "On the face of it, it's an unbeatable combination. Take the two main focuses of male desire and obsession - sport and girls - and package them as that very modern commodity, the female sports presenter. And these days she is unavoidable. Gabby Yorath fronts ITV's football coverage, Kelly Dalglish and Kirsty Gallacher take the field for Sky, while at the BBC, Sue Barker long ago transcended such piffling issues as gender to become the reigning monarch of televised sport. Even rugby, the boys' last bastion, is not exempt from the onward march of the monstrous regiment. The latest face of the sport is Kathleen Wood, a former Sky sports reporter currently on the showbiz beat for GMTV. On Saturday, she will start fronting Scotsport Rugby Roundup, STV's new weekly show on Scottish rugby, which she hopes will boost the flagging spirits of the sport. While Kirsty Gallacher famously posed for Maxim magazine last month, one can assume there's little chance of Wood appearing minimally clad in the pages of a lads mag, especially not in the foreseeable future as she is eight months pregnant. When she heard the job was up for grabs three weeks ago, she had just begun maternity leave from GMTV. \"I thought, damn, what bad timing. But when I spoke to the people at STV, they said, yeah, yeah, it's the most natural thing in the world. It was pats on the back and good on you, you've got the balls to do it.\" In fact, \"ballsy\" is the word that springs to mind when you think of Wood. During her stint on the sports beat for Sky, she consistently impressed with her passion, knowledge and sheer authenticity. Now 30, she was raised in Edinburgh where, with rugby-playing brothers and a father who was a club vice president, \"I spent a lot of time down rugby clubs when I was little\".

      "bodyText": "It was back to work for most of the Paris Metro's 4.4m famously ill-tempered daily passengers yesterday, but the regional transport authority, RATP, was doing its best to relieve post-holiday tension: a soothing cup of green tea and a relaxing massage awaited all those who wanted them. \"It's the third millennium,\" a series of psychedelic posters announced across the network yesterday. \"Time to approach life differently, to look around, to communicate. Let's dream, let's smile, let's relax, let's love ... Join us for massage and tea-tasting. Together, let's make city rhyme with stress-free.\" A spokesman for RATP, whose past attempts to cosset its passengers have included perfumed passageways and classical music on the platforms, said the offer was intended as \"a temporary New Year's present\" from the authority to its customers, but it was proving so popular that the initiative might be extended. \"It's only the first day and our four relaxation centres are all over-run,\" he said. \"I don't think there's any doubt that this really appeals to Parisians. They're always complaining that they're frantic and over-stretched and hassled. We're giving them the opportunity to keep cool.\" The massage service is available from noon to 6pm at Miromesnil, Republique, Gare-de-Lyon and Massy-Palaiseau stations. At the busy Republique station, New Age music was playing as tetchy travellers were offered a special blend of oriental green tea, - \"soothing and refreshing for both body and mind\" - revitalising algae-based biscuits, a 10-minute massage, and The Pocket Guide to Serenity, a small booklet of tips on zen and the art of taking the Metro. \"Create a natural defence,\" was one suggestion. \"Smile!

But Stantonbury Campus in Milton Keynes has a more modern take on the idea of setting up smaller units within a large group of pupils. </p> <p>Stantonbury is the largest comprehensive school in Britain, with more than 2,600 pupils. To ensure the greatest effectiveness, the students are divided into separate \"halls\" on the main campus site. The four halls for students aged between 12 and 16 are called Dansteed, Grafton, Portway and Saxon; each contains around 500 pupils, has around 30 staff, and its own Head of Hall. Post-16 students have their own facilities in Cooksey Hall. </p> <p>This works extremely well, says John Wilkins, one of Stantonbury's two co-directors - or joint head teachers. \"People think of it as a house system, but it's not some kind of artificial construct or notional thing - each hall is a building, an actual space where the students work.\" </p> <p>The hall system was established at Stantonbury in 1988. \"We felt at the time that as the largest school in the country we had to think carefully what structures were most appropriate,\" says Wilkins. \"Our most important focal group was the students, and we felt they needed an academic and social base.\" </p> <p>Dividing the pupils into smaller groups gives them more security, the opportunity for more individual attention and challenges and the feeling that they are not just a face in a very large crowd. </p> <p>It also helps that, except in more specialised subjects, the teachers stay with one hall throughout their time at the school. It means that everyone can get to know everyone else - by sight at least. </p> <p>Halls, says Wilkins, are an integral part of the way the school works. \"We have an informal ethos, we are an organisation that works without obvious hierarchy,\" he explains. </p> <p>\"There is an openness in relationships throughout the school from the youngest student to the sixth form, from a part-time cleaner to the directors. The hall structure is an element of that - we make reference points smaller than the whole institution so good, effective, harmonious relationships can develop.\" </p> <p>The benefits of being part of a hall are bolstered by a carefully-structured tutor system. Each pupil in each hall's new intake is assigned to a form tutor, who will take a special interest in them throughout their school career. </p> <p>To reinforce the relationship, the year eight pupils also have a three-day residential course with their tutors during their first term at the school to allow tutors and students to get to know each other better. \"The tutors are the first contact with parents and have an overview right across the student's work,\" says Wilkins. </p> <p>\"Wherever possible, the tutor stays with their tutor group throughout the next four years. Our year 11 pupils mostly have the same tutor groups that they had when they first came to the school.\" </p> <p>Achieving a smaller scale within a large institution helps students find their feet and feel they are not just a small part of an anonymous mass. But at the same time, Stantonbury can make its size work for it. The space and resources available mean that the school has particularly good facilities for sports and the arts - in fact, it is a specialist arts college. The Stantonbury Campus Leisure Centre is run as a joint-use facility and as well as being used by local schools and sports clubs is the main focus for competitive swimming in the area. It has a professionally equipped theatre, and the Milton Keynes Music Service is also based on the campus. </p> <p>Stantonbury's most recent Ofsted report, carried out last November, noted its large size and praised the school's academic attainment as well as its student support schemes and extra-curricular activities. </p> <p>Stantonbury serves the full ability range, but the average CAT score at intake is below average; these pupils, notes the Ofsted report, gain ground, especially in the first two years. </p> <p>\"We believe very strongly that what we do in terms of school organisation and ethos should be judged in terms of success,\" says Wilkins. \"First of all, that means exam results.

      "body": "<p>The ringing of the bell at Kingsdale school in south London signals institutionalised pandemonium. A cram of pupils, full of high spirits, all trying, unsuccessfully, to squeeze through the same door at the same time; a troop of others bustle across a courtyard to assembly. A few slope off in different directions, like lost sheep hoping the shepherd won't round them up before they reach the gates. A thousand teenage bodies, countless raging hormones and just a few minutes to get to where they need to be. </p> <p>Like most schools, every hour is rush hour at Kingsdale. The corridors are divided down the middle with a red line, like a dual carriageway, and there are arrows to direct the human traffic between lessons. But as in any rush hour, there are casualties. </p> <p>The headteacher, Steve Morrison, says: \"If you're trying to put 1,000 children through a five-foot corridor it's not going to work out whatever you do. Invariably there are going to be problems. When children get excluded it is almost always after something that happened in the corridors or in the dining area.\" </p> <p>Like all public spaces, school buildings have their own internal, environmental logic. Things happen in a certain way because they always have. Question whether it makes sense for all lessons to start and finish at the same time or if children really need to be in school all day and the whole thing might unravel. So, like a family, the dsyfunctional becomes banal. Pockets of turf become renowned and reserved for particular types of behaviour. </p> <p>Some have become apocryphal - the bike sheds for smoking and snogging, the toilets for fighting and bullying, the school gates for loitering, outside the headteacher's office for punishment. Others, such as corridors and staff rooms, hold a significance that is more practical than mythological. The aesthetic aggregate of all of these spaces is the school environment. And for all too many, it is a bleak one. </p> <p>At a recent seminar, \"Policy Framework for Schoolbuilding: a barrier to innovation\", there were several tales of just how bad and badly built schools can be. The seminar, which brought together teachers, architects and designers, was sponsored by School Works, an Architecture Foundation project, in association with Demos. </p> <p>One had an open-air bridge linking different buildings that could not be used when it rained; at another, unsupervised areas became so dangerous that teachers were equipped with rape alarms. </p> <p>\"Most school buildings have been designed with a 19th-century mindset,\" says Hilary Cottam, the project director of School Works, which concentrates on improving the school environment. \"They don't take any account of how society has changed and just end up being a place to lock kids up during the day. If school looks like a prison and feels like a prison then the pupils will start acting as though they are in prison.\" Constraints on budgets are similarly restrictive. \"The capital and maintenance budgets are separated, which makes long-term planning impossible,\" says Cottam. </p> <p>Given all the other thorny issues surrounding education, the issue of building design may seem like a luxury. With low morale, performance-related pay, low recruitment, Ofsted and playground violence, architecture occupies a low priority for some. The last government, which invested virtually nothing in renovating schools, left almost two decades of wear, tear and disrepair. But when the present government announced that headteachers would get up to \u00a330,000 to spend on urgent repairs, the general secretary of the National Association of School Masters/Union of Women Teachers, Nigel de Gruchy, gave it a backhanded welcome, wondering whether some money might have been kept back to help fund \"the looming teachers' pay crisis\". </p> <p>But there is now a growing consensus that a school's built environment is central, not peripheral, to behaviour and performance in the classroom. \"Even though there is nowhere near enough money, the fact that the government has even recognised the issue as a problem is significant,\" says Dominic Cullinan, who works with Makeover at School and has been a pioneer in this field. </p> <p>The government has awarded Kingsdale \u00a39m in order to renovate the school creatively and in keeping with designs arrived at through the School Works process. Nationwide, the government has also pledged \u00a32bn in an investment programme this year. School Works, meanwhile, has been funded by the Department for Education to roll out its project nationally, producing a handbook for all schools about how they can adopt the process. </p> <p>It is telling that there has been very little research done on the subject. What little research exists shows that where a participatory approach to school improvement has been undertaken there has been a reduction in truancy, vandalism, a greater sense of ownership and better behaviour. </p> <p>At Kingsdale, which has more than its fair share of inner-city problems, Morrison believes the built environment touches too many other aspects to ignore. Sitting with his back to the CCTV camera scanning one of the corridors, he says: \"There comes a stage where you think 'What have we not looked at?'. We are working on teaching and learning and staffing. We have looked at every other aspect of our working life apart from the place that we actually work in.\" Or as one student in Barnet put it: \"Our school looks dull, old and scruffy and it makes us feel dull and boring.\" </p> <p>Changing the environment will not put an end to deviant behaviour, insists Cottam. \"If you dealt with the bike sheds then the gym might become the bike sheds. Some people will always overstep the mark and you cannot possibly police every space all the time.\" But what it could do is remove some of the reasons why so many children begin to overstep the mark. </p> <p>Take storage space. A mixture of vandalism and expense has led many schools to do away with lockers where students can put things during the day. Where they did exist, pupils did not believe their belongings were safe and so stopped using them. Either way, lockers are becoming a thing of the past. Whatever you brought to school - PE kit, text books, coats - you had to carry around all day. In the end some children just stopped bringing things altogether. \"Our backs ache, we can't take our coats off, we never arrive,\" said one student. </p> <p>Playgrounds are dominated by sporty boys while girls and the unathletic cling to the sides. \"There is no space for us, we don't really matter,\" said one girl. </p> <p>Toilets are another problem area. Poor drainage, graffiti and filth make them no-go areas. But children still need to go to the toilet. At Kingsdale they started going home to use the loo. But then many of them wouldn't come back for the rest of the day. </p> <p>And there are staff rooms. Teachers must now be one of the few graduate professions where most will never have their own desk, let alone an office, and where it remains almost impossible for someone to make an outside call or have someone contact them during the day. </p> <p>While there are no easy solutions to all of these problems, some of them are far from incurable. Some require imagination. As they discovered at Kingsdale, in many subjects it makes more sense to move the teachers rather than the pupils. Some, like secure lockers and offices for staff, will cost money. </p> <p>And most changes will require a mixture of both. In one school, each year group has been allocated its own toilet, which will remain its own until the pupils leave school. So if the toilets are trashed in year two, they will have to live with them for the remaining three or four years. </p> <p>At a School Works seminar, one teacher raised the issue of how to keep a school secure without making it feel like a prison. One architect suggested that rather than fortifying the entire structure so that it appeared formidable, there could be an inviting \"front of house\" reception, as you would find in a bank, and a system for allowing certain people past a certain point. </p> <p>With government money now committed, a number of changes are planned for Kingsdale, which range in scale and ambition. The plumbing in the toilets will be updated and the materials around the toilets changed to make them more resistant to vandalism. There will be just one common entrance to the school, which can be monitored, and then access around the school will be facilitated through the use of smart cards. Pupils will be able to log in and out, order their meals earlier in the day, thereby avoiding the crush during dinner time, and check equipment in and out. </p> <p>Every child will have a locker, which will be located in a public place, making vandalism and theft more difficult. There will also be more passive surveillance with open-plan, transparent partitions and windows in doors, so that people can see and be seen, thereby eliminating some of the murkier corners where bullying or other misdemeanours might take place. </p> <p>But more important than either, insists Cottam, is participation of the young people, teachers and support staff and the surrounding residents who will be using the school. There was an awayday for the teachers and support staff of Kingsdale, and workshops with children that incorporated dance, music and other artwork to actively involve children in imagining the school they would like to learn in. The result was a fairly overwhelming consensus as to what the problems were and some pointers as to how they might be put right. \"If you don't consult with the people using it, then you are not likely to end up with something they feel part of or that meets their needs. A school must look inspirational and meet users' needs.\" </p> <p>\u0095 If you are interested in the school environment, why not enter our competition, The School I'd Like?

      "body": "<p>I can't deal with Mark Rothko. I stick my head round the door of the room devoted to his paintings at Tate Modern and lurch out, fast. The atmosphere is too hushed, broken by stifled adult sobs and the squeak of felt-tip pens, as schoolkids, sitting cross-legged on the floor, do their studious little Rothko-ettes in purple ink. I want to run away. </p> <p>When I opened Rothko's huge 1998 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 for the first time, the book's spine wrenched itself, with a horrible tearing sound, away from the thick stack of pages. So I slid the broken-backed behemoth back into its fancy box and never looked at it again. The damn thing has been clogging up my bookshelves ever since, accusing me. Hard on its heels came the catalogue for the American National Gallery of Art's 1998 retrospective. I didn't travel to Washington to see the show, but now I have caught up with it in the somewhat reduced version at the Miro Foundation in Barcelona. The queue went right out the door. </p> <p>The Miro Foundation is a good hotel for Rothko, whose encounter with Joan Miro's semi-abstract surrealist work quickened his own drive towards abstraction. The lighting isn't great, the space is a little cramped and awkward (much of Rothko's work is just too big for its surroundings), and the exhibition layout a bit confused, so that you need to be pretty hard-nosed to follow the chronology and trajectory of his art accurately. But these are small gripes. </p> <p>Rothko's early work, from the 1930s, has been largely reduced to his 1936 self-portrait and some pictures of the New York subway, which all in their way prefigure what was to come in his later art. This makes Rothko's development look clearer than it actually was. Rothko's early work (aside from his tyro efforts to ape Paul C\u00e9zanne, Jack Levine, Honor\u00e9 Daumier) was a clunky but affable caricature, almost a kind of illustration. </p> <p>The subway paintings may be redolent of post-Depression urban alienation, but the atmosphere down there - the horrible light, the tiles, the cast iron work, the pillars - hasn't changed significantly. The grim, sallow light in these paintings comes full circle in Rothko's final works from the late 1960s, his last paintings divided by a horizon line, though the blacks and yellowed greys are steelier, the effect unremitting, sullen, remorseless. </p> <p>I don't go for Rothko's tone, his patriarchal sternness (he once even forbade his wife to take life-drawing classes, because of his certitude about the supremacy of abstraction). With Rothko, there was always a lot of wind and blather and self-aggrandising propaganda. Barnett Newman had it too, but he was also suave, and by all accounts a generous, sympathetic spirit. Rothko, on the other hand, was unapproachable, aggressive, dauntingly taciturn. He'd bite your head off, said Brice Marden. </p> <p>When the young Ellsworth Kelly approached him to talk about his work, Rothko just said something like: \"Don't you think I need a rest?\" All that Nietzsche, the long silences, the drinking, the Valium and Tofranil, fuelled his insecurities. But who are we to expect him to be a nice guy? Rothko's own pronouncements, and his calamitous inner life, his depressions and his suicide provide torque and twist to his paintings, but that shouldn't blind us to them, even though he almost went out of his way to set us mortal folks against him. At some point the artist and the work must part company. </p> <p>Much of my resistance to Rothko , however, lies in his posthumous public reputation, as much as what his paintings intimate. John Golding's recent, passionate book Paths to the Absolute wraps up with an examination of Rothko's continuing influence. Golding says that Rothko, Pollock et al \"inspired others to produce many hundreds of thousands of canvases that were subsequently either destroyed or rolled up, languishing to this day in barns, lofts and studios the world over, particularly in English-speaking countries . . . A vast proportion of abstract painting and sculpture produced during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was destined never to be seen.\" Golding is, or was, a painter as well as an academic, and his paintings have been pretty much out of the public eye for some years. He speaks from experience. The moment for making such paintings is over for the foreseeable future.

The details, the pleasures of their thinly washed, matted glazes and breathy surfaces, and the time the paintings take up (they sort of eat you, and root you to the spot) are a lesson, too, about a kind of art that isn't really made any more, a kind of looking that's all too rare. </p> <p>Rothko knows how to ravish, but it too often feels as if he is pawing you.

      "bodyText": "I can't deal with Mark Rothko. I stick my head round the door of the room devoted to his paintings at Tate Modern and lurch out, fast. The atmosphere is too hushed, broken by stifled adult sobs and the squeak of felt-tip pens, as schoolkids, sitting cross-legged on the floor, do their studious little Rothko-ettes in purple ink. I want to run away. When I opened Rothko's huge 1998 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 for the first time, the book's spine wrenched itself, with a horrible tearing sound, away from the thick stack of pages. So I slid the broken-backed behemoth back into its fancy box and never looked at it again. The damn thing has been clogging up my bookshelves ever since, accusing me. Hard on its heels came the catalogue for the American National Gallery of Art's 1998 retrospective. I didn't travel to Washington to see the show, but now I have caught up with it in the somewhat reduced version at the Miro Foundation in Barcelona. The queue went right out the door. The Miro Foundation is a good hotel for Rothko, whose encounter with Joan Miro's semi-abstract surrealist work quickened his own drive towards abstraction. The lighting isn't great, the space is a little cramped and awkward (much of Rothko's work is just too big for its surroundings), and the exhibition layout a bit confused, so that you need to be pretty hard-nosed to follow the chronology and trajectory of his art accurately. But these are small gripes. Rothko's early work, from the 1930s, has been largely reduced to his 1936 self-portrait and some pictures of the New York subway, which all in their way prefigure what was to come in his later art. This makes Rothko's development look clearer than it actually was. Rothko's early work (aside from his tyro efforts to ape Paul C\u00e9zanne, Jack Levine, Honor\u00e9 Daumier) was a clunky but affable caricature, almost a kind of illustration. The subway paintings may be redolent of post-Depression urban alienation, but the atmosphere down there - the horrible light, the tiles, the cast iron work, the pillars - hasn't changed significantly. The grim, sallow light in these paintings comes full circle in Rothko's final works from the late 1960s, his last paintings divided by a horizon line, though the blacks and yellowed greys are steelier, the effect unremitting, sullen, remorseless. I don't go for Rothko's tone, his patriarchal sternness (he once even forbade his wife to take life-drawing classes, because of his certitude about the supremacy of abstraction). With Rothko, there was always a lot of wind and blather and self-aggrandising propaganda. Barnett Newman had it too, but he was also suave, and by all accounts a generous, sympathetic spirit. Rothko, on the other hand, was unapproachable, aggressive, dauntingly taciturn. He'd bite your head off, said Brice Marden. When the young Ellsworth Kelly approached him to talk about his work, Rothko just said something like: \"Don't you think I need a rest?\" All that Nietzsche, the long silences, the drinking, the Valium and Tofranil, fuelled his insecurities. But who are we to expect him to be a nice guy? Rothko's own pronouncements, and his calamitous inner life, his depressions and his suicide provide torque and twist to his paintings, but that shouldn't blind us to them, even though he almost went out of his way to set us mortal folks against him. At some point the artist and the work must part company. Much of my resistance to Rothko , however, lies in his posthumous public reputation, as much as what his paintings intimate. John Golding's recent, passionate book Paths to the Absolute wraps up with an examination of Rothko's continuing influence. Golding says that Rothko, Pollock et al \"inspired others to produce many hundreds of thousands of canvases that were subsequently either destroyed or rolled up, languishing to this day in barns, lofts and studios the world over, particularly in English-speaking countries . . . A vast proportion of abstract painting and sculpture produced during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was destined never to be seen.\" Golding is, or was, a painter as well as an academic, and his paintings have been pretty much out of the public eye for some years. He speaks from experience. The moment for making such paintings is over for the foreseeable future. Golding's book concludes, however, as follows: \"Profundity has been in short supply but it can and will reassert itself.\" He's right about that, too, but one of Rothko's lessons is that self-avowed profundity sticks in the throat. Rothko's mature work, we must agree, is voluptuous, gorgeous, at once ample and spare. People also - as Rothko himself knew, and as Golding notes - look great in front of them. But too many people turn them into backdrops, and there are almost always too many people nowadays. The details, the pleasures of their thinly washed, matted glazes and breathy surfaces, and the time the paintings take up (they sort of eat you, and root you to the spot) are a lesson, too, about a kind of art that isn't really made any more, a kind of looking that's all too rare. Rothko knows how to ravish, but it too often feels as if he is pawing you. I can never quite forget that the colour comes out of a tube, that painted evanescence is a matter of human skill rather than divine intervention. The surface and the space get to me, the close-toned hum, the plenitude, the slippery fading indeterminacies of the painted edges, the boundaries between his forms, the responsiveness of his paintings to the light that falls on them and the illusory light within. But I find much of it the teensiest bit mawkish and hammy. Like Golding's paean to profundity, we don't have the mental space for all that any more. Or perhaps we find the effect it has on us embarrassing. It feels kind of thespian and stagey, like listening to Lawrence Olivier doing Shakespeare. Perhaps Rothko's theatricality, his sense of installation and the relationship between his painted space and the physical space where we stand before them, does indeed still have currency. We find it in some recent installation art, much of which he would have surely hated. But the waning of a style shouldn't be a cause for grief. A new one will be along at any moment.

      "bodyText": "Lobbying government is a delicate issue and banks are reluctant to admit that it matters quite as much as it clearly does. Most of the big institutions have their own public affairs departments, acting as the most direct link to government. But when the politico-economic going gets tough, or potentially expensive, firms turn to external advisers to navigate the Whitehall maze. Lloyds TSB is known to use Lexecon, an economic advisory with close links to Whitehall, while Abbey National has turned to Brunswick for its advice on the wider political backdrop. This will not stop other firms pitching for business, though. Among those thought likely to be preparing their pitches are: Apco Born out of Washington law firm Arnold and Porter, from which it derives it name, the firm has long-since severed its ties after selling itself to Grey Advertising. This gives it close links to GCI Focus, a PR firm much better known in financial circles. It is thought to have been hired by NatWest during its tussle with Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland last year. Bell Pottinger Public Affairs Owned by Chime, one of its latest new recruits is Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspectorate of schools - a prime exampe of the type of people called upon to try to wield power in Whitehall. Few, though, could claim the contact book of chairman Lord Bell, one half of the name of the agency, renowned for his work for the Conservative party. Citigate Dewe Rogerson Part of the Incepta group, it was ranked second in a poll of political lobbyists by Marketing magazine. GJW Able to claim itself as \"independent\" until last May when it was sold to BSMG Worldwide. It is regarded as one of the most politically experienced agencies. Lawson Lucas Mendelsohn A lobby firm once associated with \"Drapergate\", its founders, from which it takes its name, all have backgrounds in politics. John Mendelsohn in particular can claim close associations with this government, having worked in Tony Blair's office in opposition. It is beginning to diversify beyond lobbying to the wider communications arena. It has recently been involved in promoting the People's Lottery, fronted by Sir Richard Branson and unsuccessful in its bid to win the licence to run the National Lottery. Westminister Strategy Part of the Grayling Group, owned by the Havas Advertising group, it lists the General Medical Council among its recent clients. It claims to have led the way for statutory regulation of the public affairs industry.

The maverick Labour member for Liverpool Walton, a former junior defence minister, is typical of the key \"opinion forming\" MPs whose names are hurriedly being drawn up by opposing factions in the Square Mile's war of the moment - the blazing battle to win control of Abbey National bank. </p> <p>Forget \"see-thru shareholder value\", cost-centric synergies and exponential improvements on capital employed. This particular financial rumble, being fought between Lloyds TSB and its smaller, north of the border rival Bank of Scotland, will be settled in the corridors of Whitehall as much as in the cut-throat world of the City. The bankers involved believe their number-based arguments with their investors - aimed, that is, at cutting costs and increasing scale in a fast consolidating sector - are relatively straightforward. But they also know that it is the politicians, the civil servants and, of course, consumer groups of every conceivable flavour, which will tip the balance on one way or the other. </p> <p>Nobody mentions the concept of \"stakeholders\" but that, in effect, is the unpredictable target market in a deal which is literally worth billions to the victor. </p> <p>So any MP with a reputation for causing trouble - particularly in the field of financial services - can expect a call. Over the coming months, along with key civil servants inside the competition-related bodies such as Graham Winton - the case officer handling this latest round of bank bids - and others inside the DTI and the Treasury, voluble or impressionable MPs face a deluge of facts and figures from the three banks engaged in the \u00a320bn stand-off. It is case of getting them to make a noise or keeping them quiet. </p> <p>The stakes are high. Lloyds TSB, veteran buyer of other banks and building societies, is on the attack. It wants to add Abbey to its black horse stable, having been stirred into action by Abbey's own half-formed plan to merge its own business with Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>The argument boils down to one about the creation of a \"fifth force\" on the high street, a combination of Abbey and Bank of Scotland which might be completed if Lloyds TSB is kept at bay - versus one about creating something akin to a \"national champion\" by allowing Lloyds to take over Abbey and, in the process, enabling the new entity to become Britain's most powerful bank in terms of its number of current account customers. </p> <p>As the first of the building societies to convert to a bank more than a decade ago, Abbey has warned its investors that the competition authorities may intervene in a bid by Lloyds TSB. It is anxious to keep its arguments factual, but some bankers believe it could argue that consumers will continue to suffer in an environment where the so-called Big Four simply tighten their grip on the nation's finances. </p> <p>Lloyds, meanwhile, which could find out by February 3 whether the office of fair trading will refer its takeover plan to the competition commission - triggering a full blown inquiry - is reckoned to be preparing to argue the exact opposite. This little island simply has too many banks. Consolidation is inevitable and, in any case, related cost cuts will feed through into cheaper and better services for customers. There is both value and beauty in size, so the argument goes. </p> <p>First up are the competition lawyers, the hotshots at Clifford Chance for Lloyds TSB and Slaughter &amp; May for Abbey National. Along with the investment banks advising the protagonists - JP Morgan for Lloyds TSB, and UBS, Lehman and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter for Abbey - the lawyers have already prepared the stastistics on respective market shares and the precedents set by previous takeovers. </p> <p><strong> Political expedience</strong><br> </p> <p>The lawyers agree that on pure economic arguments alone, there is little to suggest that a bid for Abbey by Lloyds TSB would force a referral to the competition authorites. Vocal opposition, or political expediency, is another matter. Therefore, quite naturally, the gong-laden ranks of non-executive directors on both banks' boards may also be called upon to make their own, discreet impressions. </p> <p>\"It's the politics that are difficult to judge. The economics are pretty clear... Any referral to the competition commission would have to be a political case. There isn't an economic case,\" one senior banker says, bluntly. Another points cynically to the high street clearers' eventual readiness to bankroll the Post Office-based universal bank: \"Remember the government is very sensitive to being lobbied. It doesn't like it, it has to be subtle,\" one industry source said. </p> <p>But these are not just nervous times for bankers. A new director general at the office of fair trading, John Vickers, is facing his first real test. The nerve of government, particularly the embattled trade secretary Stephen Byers, who will decide whether the bid should be cleared, is also being stretched. With a general election just months away, Labour will find itself caught between being seen to provide a fair playground for the City but at the same time reacting to the threat of, say, 20,000 lost jobs </p> <p>To the discreet band of public relations specialists retained to advance the banks' conflicting messages, the influence of politics on the City is no big surprise - and an \"evil good\" for that matter. </p> <p>\"You can see the political input into mergers and acquisitions as quite a strong corporate discipline, as politicians and political judgements can affect the commercial interests of a company and ultimately the structure of a market,\" said Tamsin Rosewell, head of competition at Westminister Strategy, one of the lobby experts likely to be deployed in the battle. </p> <p>The subject has particular resonance in the light of last week's shock decision by Mr Byers to block Belgian beer group Interbrew's acquisition of Bass Brewers. The banks know the brewing industry's fate is a lesson in how not to lobby government. In the summer of 1999, for instance, Punch Taverns was able to snatch Allied Domecq's pub estate from the grips of Whitbread when the Mr Byers blocked Whitbread's agreed takeover on competition grounds. \"Whitbread was complacent and its shares have never really recovered,\" one adviser to that deal said yesterday. </p> <p>Second guessing the competition authorities in public or ignoring their influence is something the bankers want to avoid. \"It's much more about making sure the right people are aware of the right background. It's about enabling a debate among civil servants, economic advisors and public officials,\" one banker with a few City campaign medals said. </p> <p>While City strategists quibble over the supposedly all-important 25% market share threshold seemingly breached by the combination of Lloyds and Abbey, lobbyists continue to fret over the \"mood\" within government. Even though Mr Byers has made much of his decision to \"take the politics out of mergers\", handing more influence to the OFT and the competition commission, most lobbyists believe the effect has been to increase the political influence. </p> <p>\"The competition authorities and the regulators are essentially political tools. I would not argue that they are party political, but they are certainly making political judgments. They are set up in a certain way, with defined duties that complement government policy. For instance, much of the comment from the competition commission and the OFT is about protecting the interests of consumers. What does that mean, exactly? Who has defined precisely what is in the consumer interest and what isn't? The commission itself was set up through legislation. That makes it intrinsically linked to the political process through which that legislation was enacted,\" says Ms Rosewell. </p> <p><strong> Consumer focus</strong><br> </p> <p> According to one City adviser, Labour's focus on consumer interest is why MPs can expect to be courted if the OFT recommends to Mr Byers that a competition investigation is required. </p> <p>This is what Don Cruickshank - the banking \"tsar\" who was commissioned by the chancellor to review competition in the banking sector - wanted to take place. So far his advice has gone unheeded, and a number of large deals have been completed without any competition interference, notably Royal Bank of Scotland's takeover of NatWest and Barclays' acquisition of the much smaller Woolwich. The big banks are already embroiled in a competition commission investigation into small business banking which has tested their relationship with decision makers. </p> <p>But a growing body of opinion says the way the competition commission is structured makes it much easier for pressure from MPs or consumer groups to push for an inquiry. Some even believe that the easiest option for Mr Byers - so close to a general election - is to refer the deal to the competition commission. </p> <p>All the indications are, then, that Peter Kilfoyle and his colleagues should prepare to be charmed.</p> <p><strong>People of influence</strong></p> <p><strong> Graham Winton</strong>, a senior civil servant buried in the bowels of the office of fair trading, will be the first man the bankers involved in the tussle over control of Abbey National will want to reach. </p> <p>One of the anonymous mandarins inside the OFT, Mr Winton is the case officer for the initial investigation. The opinions he gathers will be crucial to the advice given to <strong> Stephen Byers</strong>, the trade and industry secretary, about whether to refer any bid by Lloyds TSB to the competition commission. </p> <p>Mr Winton will not make the decision alone, however. Officially the advice is handed to Mr Byers by <strong>John Vickers</strong>, the new and increasingly powerful director general of fair trading. <strong> Andrew White</strong>, a senior member of the OFT staff who heads the merger division, will also be an important barometer, as will another senior civil servant - <strong> Margaret Bloom</strong> - the divisional director who overseas competition in general and will be a crucial decision maker. </p> <p>She is often chair of the shadowy merger panel, which offers the final sounding board to the OFT. </p> <p>The banks have to make detailed submissions to the OFT - and will probably already have done so. Opinions on Lloyds TSB's potential bid for Abbey must be received by January 19, the day after Mr Byers is due to rule on whether the Bank of Scotland and Abbey National deal needs a competition review. Under the timetable, Lloyds TSB should hear by February 3 whether it is clear on competition grounds to launch a bid. </p> <p>It is understood that the micro-economic background of Mr Vickers has encouraged the banks to put submissions to the OFT which break down market shares in to their tiniest parts. </p> <p>The final judgment on whether to refer the decision rests with Mr Byers. While he has pledged to follow the guidance given to him by Mr Vickers, he is able to decide on \"public interest\" grounds to take a different view. </p> <p>This is where lobbying from consumer groups, particularly the Consumer Association's boss <strong> Sheila McKechnie</strong> will be used.

      "bodyText": "The office of fair trading yesterday threatened legal action against the big four travel companies over \"rip-off\" cancellation charges which are said to be the highest in Europe. UK holidaymakers can pay up to 90% of the total cost if they cancel a fortnight before departure. The OFT complains that Airtours, First Choice, JMC and Thomson have refused to give financial details to justify the charges. The firms argue the charges accurately reflect the costs of cancellation. This has led to deadlock after 14 months of negotiations between the OFT and tour operators, prompting the threat of a high court injunction. An OFT spokesman said: \"We are concerned that the way cancellation fees are calculated is unfair. In Sweden, for example, you only have to pay 50% right up to 24 hours before departure. We believe the charges are too high, particularly as tour operators are often able to resell the holidays.\" Experts estimate cancellation charges affect hundreds of thousands of British tourists every year and are now the biggest single source of holiday insurance claims.

But this willingness to take chances is one of the things that make this young pianist's recitals so exciting. </p> <p>Striding on to the platform, Kempf launched into the first, decisive major chord of the Preludio almost before the audience had had a chance to settle down.

There were some wrong or missed notes, and at times Kempf found it difficult to project Liszt's well-hidden melodies smoothly from within these thickly written scores. Indeed, he often sought refuge in the sheer volume of the noise he was producing. His triple fortissimos were certainly powerful - the Wigmore Hall piano has rarely had that much sound drawn from it - but, with every climax pushed as far as it would go, some lost their impact and began to seem unrelenting rather than momentous. Still, a spirit of heroism prevailed, never more so than in the fourth study, Mazeppa - a lengthy, pictorial episode which sends both of the pianist's hands careering wildly up and down the keyboard, and which Kempf dispatched with bravado. </p> <p>It was in the more relaxed studies that Kempf's considerable musicianship really had a chance to shine through. The melody of the third, Paysage, was picked out beautifully from the inner lines, and the fifth, Feux-follets, was offered up with graceful delicacy. The ninth, Ricordanza, was an oasis of calm, played with wistful tenderness. </p> <p>The second half, shorter by far than the first, was devoted to Chopin - the Andante spianato et Grande Polonaise, followed by the Ballade No 3 in A flat. These were better vehicles for Kempf's strengths; the Polonaise was poised and radiant, while the lilting melodies of the Ballade were lyrically phrased. </p> <p>It seemed that while the impassioned passages of the Liszt section had brought out latent aggression in Kempf, these Chopin pieces gave him the space to perform with his usual thoughtful spontaneity.

With Labour's Tony Lloyd (Manchester Central) and Joe Ashton (Bassetlaw), leading complaints that a compulsory pack would be an \"intolerable burden\" where some houses were now worth only \u00a34,000, the minister predicted sellers might only be asked to pay for the pack when their house was sold. Mr Raynsford also said that though conveyancing was cheap by world standards in England and Wales - Scotland has its own laws - 28% of transactions failed between the acceptance of an offer and the exchange of contracts. Although gazumping, the abandonment of a seller's agreement in favour of a higher offer, would not be made illegal - as it was in Scotland - because that might give too much power to a buyer \"deliberately dragging his feet\" the government hoped its reforms would curb the practice.",
