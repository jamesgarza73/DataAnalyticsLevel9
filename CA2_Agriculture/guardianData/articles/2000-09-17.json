At the same time, producer Richard Jones is careful not to upstage the music. This is one of Tchaikovsky's most gripping and imaginative scores, and the action both amplifies and enriches the orchestral writing.

In a superb piece of trompe l'oeil, Jones turns the back wall into the floor of Herman's bedroom: we seem to be looking down on him through the ceiling. It all worked brilliantly: Herman's vertical tossing and turning, the emergence of the Countess's skeleton from Herman's bedsheets. </p> <p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of Jones's achievement is that he manages to combine emotive tragedy with black, grotesque comedy, placing Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades directly in the tradition of Gogol and Dostoevsky. </p> <p>Of course, none of this would be as forceful without strong singing and playing. Vitali Taraschenko's Herman was a little stiff at first but soon developed into a vivid character study, and he had both the intense Russian tone and the lung capacity to handle the long melodic lines.

      "body": "<p>When Debbie Wilkinson went for her interview at the British Boxing Board of Control, she had no idea she would be working for a sports organisation. \"The advert just said that an office in the London Bridge area was looking for an office junior,\" says Wilkinson, who three years later is secretary to Robert Smith, the board's assistant general secretary. \"When I arrived for the interview, I was a bit bewildered by all the boxing paraphernalia, but I was soon put straight.\" </p> <p>The BBBofC has been overseeing professional British boxing since 1929. During its early days, it was mostly concerned with the procedural side of the sport, such as the recognition of championships. In the last 20 to 30 years, however, its chief purpose has been to oversee the medical welfare of professional boxers. </p> <p>By happy coincidence, Wilkinson, 21, is a boxing fan. \"Although when I first started working here, I think Frank Bruno and Mike Tyson were the only boxers I could name. Now you could give me the name of almost any British boxer, and I will probably be able to tell you his weight, his manager and his fight record.\" </p> <p>She also enjoys going to watch matches whenever she can. \"I think you either love it or hate it,\" she says. \"Some of my friends think it's awful, but I find it really exciting. A lot of people don't realise the discipline and hard work that it takes to be a boxer.\" </p> <p>This is Wilkinson's first permanent job, although, appropriately enough, she always enjoyed sport at school and had completed a course in business in sport that she believes has come in very handy. \"It taught me some very useful organisational skills.\" </p> <p>She has a heavy typing load, because Smith is also the southern area secretary for the board. \"There is a lot of correspondence, but I've devised a system so that whenever possible there's already a standard letter, which saves a lot of work,\" she explains. \"Robert often writes reports on matches he's been to see and I really enjoy typing those up; they're extremely interesting and give me a great insight into the sport.\" </p> <p>Boxing is a demanding sport and no one, least of all the BBBofC, would deny that it can be extremely hazardous. All professional boxers must be licensed, and the rigorous rules which govern licensing are designed to ensure that the boxers are fully prepared, fit and well matched (ie, will be fighting someone with the equivalent level of expertise). One of Wilkinson's most time consuming tasks is issuing licences. \"I spend about three hours every day liaising with licence holders. It's not just boxers who need to be licensed but trainers, managers and referees.\" </p> <p>Licences are issued annually and are not given out lightly. The boxer must have a full medical examination by a board doctor, plus an eye test, a certificate of HIV testing and proof of hepatitis B vaccination. He or she must also undergo a brain scan and provide a skull x-ray report. </p> <p>\"Three weeks before a contest I will check whether or not the boxers concerned are due for a brain scan or a medical, or whether their licence fee is due,\" says Wilkinson. \"If anything needs to be done, I'll write and inform their managers. It's important that I do this well in advance, because although there are nine cen tres that do brain scans, they are scattered all over the country. For example, there's only one in London, so I must give them enough time to make sure they can get an appointment. I also look after the contracts between boxers and their managers - every boxer must be managed for his first year of turning professional.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson is responsible for the board's website. \"Someone came in to set it up and show me how to make changes to it. I put all our press statements on it, plus the circulars that go out once a month which state what fights are happening.\" </p> <p>Although boxing is an over whelmingly male dominated sport, there are now six women who are officially licensed to box - and more on the way - a number of female promoters and one female manager. \"When Jane Couch became the first professional woman boxer, the phone didn't stop ringing for two weeks. I tried to deal with as many of the calls as I could, otherwise Robert and Simon [Simon Block, general secretary of the BBBofC] would have been inundated,\" says Wilkinson. </p> <p>\"The best thing about this job is the people. I've yet to meet a boxer - one of the male ones that is - who wasn't a complete gentleman.\" </p> <p><strong> The inside track:</strong> A man's world? </p> <p> by Bill Saunders After a quarter of a century of equal opportunities, there are still men's jobs and women's jobs. Sometimes the reasons for the division are superficially obvious. Boxing is a case in point, firefighting another. Greater Manchester fire service recruited its first professional women firefighter only this year. </p> <p>But apart from the physical requirements - big firefighters can carry heavier people - there can be other, subtler influences. There is tradition: fire services prefer to recruit people with experience of the armed forces, because they are organised on military lines. And there is culture: well-meaning firefighters invited to treat a female colleague as one of the boys have done just that in the past. While it might be thought an amusing prank to forcibly dress an ex-guardsman in a skimpy nightdress and chain him to the station railings as an \"initiation ceremony\", the joke, such as it is, turns sour when the victim is a woman. </p> <p>But gender distinctions are not always so rough and ready. There is no physical reason why the vast majority of secretaries are women, but the fact remains that they are. It is such a glaring discrepancy that some try to deny it. Agencies will claim that things are changing, and that 15 to 20% of clerical jobs are done by men these days. Closer examination reveals, however, that this includes such positions as accounts clerk. When secretarial work only is taken into account, the percentage of men involved becomes so small that it barely registers. </p> <p>Another curiosity is that a couple of years ago, one secretarial agency discovered that male PAs tend to work for women managers. So perhaps when more women rise to the boardroom, the gender imbalance in office management will shift accordingly. </p> <p>It should be noted that in some fields - public relations is a good example - the rise of women in senior management has led to more secretaries being promoted, simply because those managers often began work as secretaries themselves.</p>",

And it's quite a stage to command - not just the Arena audience (whose pashminas must have muffled 10% of the sound), but a miniature movie orchestra with strings and electric guitar; a dire background of projected fuchsia blobs resembling an Odeon foyer on a wet Wednesday; and a dance line-up-cum-backing group who writhe in daft get-ups like Maurice Binder's title credits for Bond films. </p> <p>But it doesn't matter. Asha-ji sings, the air thickens. She is 67, veteran of 12,000 soundtrack songs dubbed over whatever was Bollywood's desirable mouth of the moment. She can sing anything, any way - in a the-story-so-far chat session, she moves unaccompanied through decades and regions of style, gently teasing the jerks of phrasing of formal Indian performers. Later she sings one classical number for real, in a session with a trad dancer in which she provides a river of smooth-flowing mouth music for his fingers and feet. </p> <p>Her upper register conveys a permanent nubile 17, youthful not through silliness or squeakiness, but enthusiasm - in the dreamy intros of many of her songs you hear a young girl's voice across a misty river at dawn. In her lowest registers she can growl and croon along with Celia Cruz. She does a couple of show-stoppers from 30 years back as full-belt as Shirley Bassey, and an operetta-ish duet with male support so coy it could be Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy cooing to each other round a tree trunk, then responds to a younger male partner with vocal intelligence and a physical rapport expressed in minute checks and balances of movements across the stage. It's very sexy but never absurd: their brains are involved as well as their bodies. </p> <p>Apart from the occasional brow-mop, she makes it seem no effort at all. An ecstatic night. </p> <p> ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

And it's quite a stage to command - not just the Arena audience (whose pashminas must have muffled 10% of the sound), but a miniature movie orchestra with strings and electric guitar; a dire background of projected fuchsia blobs resembling an Odeon foyer on a wet Wednesday; and a dance line-up-cum-backing group who writhe in daft get-ups like Maurice Binder's title credits for Bond films. But it doesn't matter. Asha-ji sings, the air thickens. She is 67, veteran of 12,000 soundtrack songs dubbed over whatever was Bollywood's desirable mouth of the moment. She can sing anything, any way - in a the-story-so-far chat session, she moves unaccompanied through decades and regions of style, gently teasing the jerks of phrasing of formal Indian performers. Later she sings one classical number for real, in a session with a trad dancer in which she provides a river of smooth-flowing mouth music for his fingers and feet. Her upper register conveys a permanent nubile 17, youthful not through silliness or squeakiness, but enthusiasm - in the dreamy intros of many of her songs you hear a young girl's voice across a misty river at dawn. In her lowest registers she can growl and croon along with Celia Cruz. She does a couple of show-stoppers from 30 years back as full-belt as Shirley Bassey, and an operetta-ish duet with male support so coy it could be Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy cooing to each other round a tree trunk, then responds to a younger male partner with vocal intelligence and a physical rapport expressed in minute checks and balances of movements across the stage. It's very sexy but never absurd: their brains are involved as well as their bodies. Apart from the occasional brow-mop, she makes it seem no effort at all. An ecstatic night. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

A new report by the Industrial Society blames male managers. \"The fact that most decision makers within organisations are male is likely to be perpetuating male ideas about the superiority of male working patterns and male performance at work,\" claims the research. </p> <p>May Smith, an occupational psychologist specialising in gender, agrees. \"Men are still seen as the main breadwinners and women as secondary earners.

The majority of people who have this attitude are men.\" </p> <p>Susan Block, of Hay Management Consultants, coaches women into higher salaries. She blames the fact that being \"aggressive\", \"ambitious\" and \"pushy\" is often rewarded in men and criticised in women. \"We can't win,\" she says. \"If we're too assertive, we are seen as not doing our job properly because we've got ideas above our station. And if we're too nice - which women are, in fact, socialised to be in the workplace - we are seen as a pushover. Both help leave women at the bottom of the pay and promotion pile.\" </p> <p>The equal opportunities commission believes women suffer at two levels. \"On an individual basis, they are paid differently for the same job. And on a collective level, women-dominated professions are almost always paid less than male-dominated professions,\" says chair, Julie Mellor. </p> <p>Secretarial work is a classic example. \"It's only since men have re-entered the field that salaries are rising significantly,\" confirms a spokesperson for the recruitment consultancy, Manpower. </p> <p>Research consistently shows, however, that, despite these discrepancies, women tend to be less preoccupied with salary and status than men. \"Instead, women are often more concerned with job satisfaction and receiving non-financial perks such as family-friendly hours and ongoing training,\" says Marilyn Davidson, professor of managerial psychology at the University of Science and Technology in Manchester. \"This means that, unlike men, they often don't ask for salary increases. And in today's marketplace, if you don't ask, you don't get.\" </p> <p>Worse still, the Industrial Society report points out, it's simply not the done thing to ask someone what salary they're on unless you share a house or, better still, a bedroom. Even at job interviews, potential recruits squirm in their seats at the very thought of bringing up the money factor. The result is that you are left without a clue what your secretarial colleague, Ben, is paid. And in turn, your employer is able to get away with paying you significantly less than him. </p> <p>In fact, Universum's latest survey claims this veil of secrecy surrounding pay-packets means that today's female graduates are more likely than ever to expect - and therefore to demand - less than men. The survey found the average woman anticipates earning \u00a3200 a month less than her male peers in her first job, and a staggering \u00a3400 a month less, five years later. </p> <p>\"It gets worse as she gets older,\" says a spokeswoman for the Industrial Society. \"In her early 20s, a woman earns about 91% of a man's pay. In her 30s, 87%; in her 40s, 75%; and in her 50s, 72%.\" Employees should be confident enough to share their personal salary details with each other as a way of exposing discriminatory pay gaps, she concludes. \"If, from such discussions, you suspect you are being paid less because you're female, ask your personnel department to provide you with a scatter diagram showing the spread of pay identified by sex so that you can see where you are.\" </p> <p>Then, advises the Industrial Society, objectively assess your strengths and capability in relation to the organisation's needs. \"It's a good idea to get a colleague - a male one is helpful, to get a different perspective - to help you make that assessment. At this point, use your information from personnel on pay - together with salary figures for similar posts in the job pages - to set yourself a reasonable target figure for what you think you should be paid.\" </p> <p>Openness is key, adds Block. When you next go for an interview, ask directly about pay. \"And when you're talking about your achievements, don't say 'We achieved...' Studies show one of the reasons men get higher salaries is because they sell themselves, saying 'I achieved.'\"</p>",

And in today's marketplace, if you don't ask, you don't get.\" Worse still, the Industrial Society report points out, it's simply not the done thing to ask someone what salary they're on unless you share a house or, better still, a bedroom. Even at job interviews, potential recruits squirm in their seats at the very thought of bringing up the money factor. The result is that you are left without a clue what your secretarial colleague, Ben, is paid. And in turn, your employer is able to get away with paying you significantly less than him. In fact, Universum's latest survey claims this veil of secrecy surrounding pay-packets means that today's female graduates are more likely than ever to expect - and therefore to demand - less than men. The survey found the average woman anticipates earning \u00a3200 a month less than her male peers in her first job, and a staggering \u00a3400 a month less, five years later. \"It gets worse as she gets older,\" says a spokeswoman for the Industrial Society. \"In her early 20s, a woman earns about 91% of a man's pay. In her 30s, 87%; in her 40s, 75%; and in her 50s, 72%.\" Employees should be confident enough to share their personal salary details with each other as a way of exposing discriminatory pay gaps, she concludes. \"If, from such discussions, you suspect you are being paid less because you're female, ask your personnel department to provide you with a scatter diagram showing the spread of pay identified by sex so that you can see where you are.\" Then, advises the Industrial Society, objectively assess your strengths and capability in relation to the organisation's needs. \"It's a good idea to get a colleague - a male one is helpful, to get a different perspective - to help you make that assessment. At this point, use your information from personnel on pay - together with salary figures for similar posts in the job pages - to set yourself a reasonable target figure for what you think you should be paid.\" Openness is key, adds Block. When you next go for an interview, ask directly about pay. \"And when you're talking about your achievements, don't say 'We achieved...' Studies show one of the reasons men get higher salaries is because they sell themselves, saying 'I achieved.'\"",

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson is facing a fresh call for him to be removed as Northern Ireland Secretary by the Province's Deputy First Minister, Seamus Mallon. Mallon's demand that Mandelson leave his post reflects nationalist concerns that the Secretary of State is diluting police reforms in a bid to shore up First Minister David Trimble. The rancour between Mallon, the SDLP Newry and Armagh MP, on one side, and Trimble and Mandelson on the other over policing threatens the overall stability of Northern Ireland's power-sharing coalition. Speaking in New York, Mallon was bitterly critical of Mandelson's handling of the Patten report into RUC reform. He told a meeting of the politically influential National Committee on Foreign Policy that every time nationalists try to be generous 'he [Mandelson] takes all, misrepresents your position and gives nothing'. The SDLP deputy leader said he was confident the policing debate would improve 'before Peter does any more damage'. He predicted that while he and First Minister Trimble might go eventually, the Good Friday Agreement would remain in place. As for the fate of the Northern Ireland Secretary, Mallon added: 'Peter, I hope, will [go].' The Irish government, the SDLP and Sinn Fein claim Mandelson has watered down key reforms to the RUC, including the dilution of local political controls Patten recommended should be imposed on the new Police Service of Northern Ireland. Mandelson warned nationalists last week not to become 'absolutist' about the Patten report - a clear acknowledgement that Trimble will need some concessions on policing to remain as Ulster Unionist Party leader and First Minister. Unionists have reacted furiously to Mallon's remarks highlighting the widening gap between the two main coalition partners in Belfast, the SDLP and the UUP. John Taylor MP, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said: 'My real concern is that Seamus Mallon is abusing his position as deputy First Minister. If he continues this line he will bring about the collapse of the Stormont Assembly because the unionist community will withdraw their support for him. He is beginning to go too far.' Taylor admitted that if his party loses this week's Westminister byelection in South Antrim, it would spell the end of the pro-Agreement unionist project and precipitate a collapse of the Assembly. Senior allies of David Trimble are worried that the unionist community will 'give Tony Blair a poke in the eye' by voting for the vehemently anti-Agreement candidate the Reverend William McCrea of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. A growing number of unionists fear the Patten report will give paramilitary-linked parties a degree of control over the new police force. They are also disillusioned with the release of paramilitary prisoners and the ongoing loyalist feud. Anti-Agreement unionists have pointed to the intra-loyalist violence as evidence that the political process has brought nothing but death and destruction to Protestant areas. Defeat for Trimble's candidate, the former British Airways press officer David Burnside, would undoubtedly provoke a leadership challenge at the UUP's conference next month. Burnside's team is focusing on a final publicity offensive against McCrea in a desperate bid to raise the UUP vote in South Antrim. They will point to McCrea's open association with the loyalist killer Billy 'King Rat' Wright, who was shot dead in the Maze prison two years ago. The DUP candidate stood on a public platform with Wright when the loyalist terrorist was expelled from the Ulster Volunteer Force for orchestrating violence at Drumcree in 1996 and order ing the murder of Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick.

      "body": "<p>Red Mullet - the exotic fish beloved of posher-than-thou dinner parties - are invading the North Sea. </p> <p>Usually found in the balmy Mediterranean, the fish are migrating north as a result of global warming. Scottish fishermen are catching red mullet in large numbers, while cod and whiting are dying because the water is too warm. </p> <p>Marine biologists say the North Sea is undergoing a rapid 'regime-shift' from a temperate sea to an almost sub-tropical one. </p> <p>In the last decade the amount of plankton - the 'grass of the sea' - has risen 10-fold (90-fold in the winters), and the level of life on the seabed has doubled. A study in the journal Science showed that the Nineties was the hottest decade in the last thousand years. Oceanographers have estimated that in six years the winter sea temperature around the Faroes has risen by 4 degrees centigrade. </p> <p>Red mullet, previously only found as far north as the English Channel, are now breeding off the west and east coasts of Scotland. Dr Chris Reid, director of the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, said: 'There's enough to form a fishery.' Other warm-water species, such as anchovy and octopus, have been found in the Channel in the last year. </p> <p>Reid said: 'We are seeing an increase in bio-diversity in the North Sea. This is a very sharp change. It is almost certainly linked to global warming.' </p> <p>Plankton absorbs huge amounts of carbon dioxide and supports almost all other forms of life. The number of creatures on the bed of the North Sea, primarily starfish and worms, has thrived as a result of the increased plankton. </p> <p>But the changes may not benefit the fishing industry overall. Cod and whiting are being driven out and many of the new fish may not be so valuable as the old ones. 'The value of fishery might be reduced,' said Reid. </p> <p>Mathew Davis, of World Wide Fund For Nature, said: 'There are all sorts of invasive species going in, and they are a threat to native species.' The WWF will launch its Oceans Recovery Campaign this week demanding the Government give greater protection to fish stocks. </p> <p>However, the North Sea's life as a sub-tropical ocean may not last long.

      "bodyText": "Red Mullet - the exotic fish beloved of posher-than-thou dinner parties - are invading the North Sea. Usually found in the balmy Mediterranean, the fish are migrating north as a result of global warming. Scottish fishermen are catching red mullet in large numbers, while cod and whiting are dying because the water is too warm. Marine biologists say the North Sea is undergoing a rapid 'regime-shift' from a temperate sea to an almost sub-tropical one. In the last decade the amount of plankton - the 'grass of the sea' - has risen 10-fold (90-fold in the winters), and the level of life on the seabed has doubled. A study in the journal Science showed that the Nineties was the hottest decade in the last thousand years. Oceanographers have estimated that in six years the winter sea temperature around the Faroes has risen by 4 degrees centigrade. Red mullet, previously only found as far north as the English Channel, are now breeding off the west and east coasts of Scotland. Dr Chris Reid, director of the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, said: 'There's enough to form a fishery.' Other warm-water species, such as anchovy and octopus, have been found in the Channel in the last year. Reid said: 'We are seeing an increase in bio-diversity in the North Sea. This is a very sharp change. It is almost certainly linked to global warming.' Plankton absorbs huge amounts of carbon dioxide and supports almost all other forms of life. The number of creatures on the bed of the North Sea, primarily starfish and worms, has thrived as a result of the increased plankton. But the changes may not benefit the fishing industry overall. Cod and whiting are being driven out and many of the new fish may not be so valuable as the old ones. 'The value of fishery might be reduced,' said Reid. Mathew Davis, of World Wide Fund For Nature, said: 'There are all sorts of invasive species going in, and they are a threat to native species.' The WWF will launch its Oceans Recovery Campaign this week demanding the Government give greater protection to fish stocks. However, the North Sea's life as a sub-tropical ocean may not last long. The melting of the Arctic ice-cap - already 40 per cent gone and expected to disappear by 2040 - is predicted to disrupt weather patterns so much that the north-east Atlantic will grow colder.",

First, government cannot solve all problems, and sometimes does more harm than good. Second, some problems are best left to government. It is far more able than the private sector to deliver health and education services that successfully tackle inequality.

In its policies, we have seen, for example, serious attempts to discourage lone parents from staying at home with their children.

This is often impossible to calculate, but in one notorious case, an employer was fined \u00a36,000 by the Inland Revenue.

It makes it a duty of employers to police the visas and passports of their employees, threatening them with hefty fines if they allow people without the correct paperwork to continue working.

Rather than spend time making certain their records are in order, many companies choose to avoid the risk by simply not granting paid paternity leave. We need to examine existing and pending legislation to ensure that it is clear, precise and, above all, minimal. We need to change the culture of government, so those in charge of the rule book come to understand that 'less equals more'.</p> <p>Government also needs to start respecting professionalism within the public sector, and curbing its desire to satiate people like teachers and nurses with paperwork and excessive regulation. Speaking to numerous teachers and nurses, I am consistently struck by the sense of mission they have about their work. But teachers report being unable to plan lessons with any degree of creativity, because they are too bound up with form-filling. Their paperwork has multiplied over the last decade, as have the number of rules governing the level of permissible contact between teachers and their pupils. Young people are reluctant to join these professions because they are not sufficiently respected in society.

For instance, the Treasury claimed that the tax burden on the 'average family' has fallen to its lowest level since 1972. It only takes a little analysis to see that this 'average' family would have to be non-smoking, non-drinking, never fly abroad on holiday, not pay a mortgage and not pay council tax.

They are impressed that he has not sought to avoid blame - telling officers who interviewed him that he alone was responsible for the debacle.

We look at these kids and young women fighting in trainers and T- shirts. We laugh at the way they wear charms to ward off bullets. We look at their drunken and doped-up leaders and we cannot take them seriously. But these kids have grown up fighting and killing and committing atrocities. 'They also don't understand the rules. No one has ever told them that war is not like a Rambo video, about how soldiers should behave, when to be scared, so they will just stand there and blast away.' What happens next to Marshall is in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief of UK Land Forces, General Sir Mike Jackson. Already it seems certain that Marshall will not face a court martial. Senior defence sources are said to have been impressed by the way he attempted to defend his men from the West Side Boys during his capture, sustaining a savage beating. They are impressed that he has not sought to avoid blame - telling officers who interviewed him that he alone was responsible for the debacle. 'If Marshall can convince an inquiry that he simply made a mistake by acting on his own initiative, his career will not be damaged,' said a senior source. 'But if he is found negligent in any way a public example will made of him.' In his 'naming and shaming' by the Army in the past three days, Marshall may feel this has already happened.",

Although Spanish police believe the eight grenades and a timer found in woods near a museum in the Basque country would not have caused any injuries, they are alarmed that ETA members managed to penetrate tight security and place explosives within 500 metres of their targets. The attempted attack is being regarded as a propaganda coup for the organisation which has suffered its worst week since 1992 when three of its most senior members were seized in the Basque seaside town of Bidart. Ironically it was in the same village in France that Spain's most wanted man was arrested by French police on Friday night. The move came three days after police swooped on cities across Spain arresting those they say have been guiding the group's return to violence. Ignacio Gracia Arregui, 44, had apparently been under surveillance for some time in Bidart, a popular tourist resort. He was arrested with his French companion, Fabienne Tapia, mother of their two-year-old daughter, at their home in an apartment building named Agur Deneri - Basque for 'Welcome to All'. Detectives reportedly found a pistol in the flat of Gracia, known by his nom de guerre of I\u00f1aki de Renteria. ETA members in France routinely carry weapons so that, if arrested, they must be tried in France and serve any sentence before being extradited to Spain. They also reportedly found false identity papers, French and Spanish. But in a move called Operation Black Wolf last week Judge Baltasar Garzon, famous for his attempts to try General Augusto Pinochet for genocide, ordered the arrests of 20 individuals alleged to run ETA's political, strategic and logistical efforts inside Spain. Eighteen are now in preventative detention, awaiting the outcome of Garzon's investigation. Gracia is accused, with Jose Javier Arizkuren Ruiz, of organising a plot to kill King Juan Carlos five years ago during his annual summer holiday in Mallorca, in an indictment issued by Garzon. But just as the group responded swiftly with violence to the Spanish arrests - a retired Socialist politician and academic Jose Ramon Recalde was shot in the face, but not killed, last Thursday outside his home in San Sebastian - so they are likely to mount an attack to counter Gracia's arrest. So far this year 12 people have been killed by ETA, which called off a 14-month truce in December.",

      "body": "<p>A nuclear catastrophe - triggered by a fault in Russia's ageing electrical grid - was averted last week thanks to a 'heroic' emergency operation by power station workers.</p> <p>Details of how one of Russia's main nuclear plants and the country's largest plutonium-processing centre came close to disaster emerged slowly, prompting new alarm in a country still reeling from a string of disasters.</p> <p>Nuclear experts said 'courageous' workers at the Beloyarsk power station and the Mayak reprocessing plant had managed to prevent a Chernobyl-style accident. Environmental campaigners warned that the crumbling state of Russia's infrastructure meant such close escapes could be expected with growing frequency.</p> <p>Preliminary investigations showed that a short circuit in the regional electricity system caused a sudden blackout in three nuclear reactors in the Urals. Its cause remains unclear, although it has been widely attributed to a fault in the poorly maintained network.</p> <p>Unexpected power cuts at nuclear plants, which are designed to work ceaselessly, pose a severe risk. There was controversy yesterday over whether built-in emergency electricity systems took over as they should have done. Minatom, Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, insisted that all back-up systems at both sites began working in the seconds after the accident, but environmental activists reported that the standby electricity generators of at least one of the reactors had failed to start.</p> <p>These sources say a technical hitch at the Beloyarsk plant, in the Sverdlovsk region, meant that the diesel generators built into the reactor failed to start automatically. Without a separate supply of electricity, the cooling system at the heart of the plant allegedly stopped working - causing the temperature in the core reactor to soar to dangerous levels, as workers lost control over the chain reactions occurring within.</p> <p>'The problem was that the diesel generators were in poor condition and so the staff on the plant needed 36 minutes to repair them to get them started,' said Vladimir Slivyak, co-chairman of the Ecodefence organisation, which has spent the past week gathering information about the mishap. 'It was up to the personnel on the plant to avert a serious nuclear accident.

      "bodyText": "A nuclear catastrophe - triggered by a fault in Russia's ageing electrical grid - was averted last week thanks to a 'heroic' emergency operation by power station workers. Details of how one of Russia's main nuclear plants and the country's largest plutonium-processing centre came close to disaster emerged slowly, prompting new alarm in a country still reeling from a string of disasters. Nuclear experts said 'courageous' workers at the Beloyarsk power station and the Mayak reprocessing plant had managed to prevent a Chernobyl-style accident. Environmental campaigners warned that the crumbling state of Russia's infrastructure meant such close escapes could be expected with growing frequency. Preliminary investigations showed that a short circuit in the regional electricity system caused a sudden blackout in three nuclear reactors in the Urals. Its cause remains unclear, although it has been widely attributed to a fault in the poorly maintained network. Unexpected power cuts at nuclear plants, which are designed to work ceaselessly, pose a severe risk. There was controversy yesterday over whether built-in emergency electricity systems took over as they should have done. Minatom, Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, insisted that all back-up systems at both sites began working in the seconds after the accident, but environmental activists reported that the standby electricity generators of at least one of the reactors had failed to start. These sources say a technical hitch at the Beloyarsk plant, in the Sverdlovsk region, meant that the diesel generators built into the reactor failed to start automatically. Without a separate supply of electricity, the cooling system at the heart of the plant allegedly stopped working - causing the temperature in the core reactor to soar to dangerous levels, as workers lost control over the chain reactions occurring within. 'The problem was that the diesel generators were in poor condition and so the staff on the plant needed 36 minutes to repair them to get them started,' said Vladimir Slivyak, co-chairman of the Ecodefence organisation, which has spent the past week gathering information about the mishap. 'It was up to the personnel on the plant to avert a serious nuclear accident. They worked heroically.' Alexei Yablokov of the Centre for Ecological Problems of Russia endorsed this view: 'We were just half an hour from another Chernobyl - had it not been for the professionalism of the plant staff.' At around lunchtime on Saturday last weekend, a crash echoed from within the walls of the Beloyarsk compound. Local residents - many of whom were celebrating the annual town festival - listened in horror. Most of the people who live in Zarechny, the settlement which has grown up around the plant, are either current or former employees - so were well equipped to judge the gravity of the noise. The precise cause of the sound remains unclear. Unconfirmed sources suggest that while technicians struggled to get the diesel generators working, they were forced to shut down the reactor manually. Residents may have heard steam spurting suddenly from the cooling plant, as pressure in the system mounted. One of the immediate results of the shutdown at Beloyarsk was a power failure at the nearby Mayak processing plant in the Chelyabinsk region, where two reactors were in operation. The potential consequences of malfunction at the vast, high-security Mayak plant are no less alarming. Scientists there take spent nuclear fuel from all over the former Soviet Union and convert it into weapons-grade plutonium and high-level waste. The site is estimated to contain 120 million curies of radioactive waste - much of it held in liquid form in vast tanks - including seven times the amount of strontium-90 and caesium-137 that was released in Chernobyl. Mayak was without power for 45 minutes and the reactors were automatically shut down. The head of the plant, Vitaliy Sadovnikov, told a local newspaper that this was the worst blackout the station had faced and it was only his staff's 'near-military discipline' which prevented a serious accident. He said the back-up electricity provider, designed to cool down the reactors in the event of such an emergency, had only been started up 30 minutes after the plant was brought to a halt. But yesterday Bulat Nigmatulin, a Deputy Minister at Minatom, said these reports were lies. 'This unpleasant situation came about because for the first time there was a breakdown in the local energy system,' he said. 'The atomic installations at Beloyarsk and Mayak are protected against this kind of accident, and on this occasion everything went exactly according to plan, with on-site emergency electricity sources starting up immediately.' He said 30-minute delays would have led to explosions in the reactors. Officials at both plants report there was no radiation contamination as a result of the emergency shutdowns. Environmental activists in the region continue to test the site, but are so far satisfied that this is the case. Although a crisis was averted, analysts agree that both mishaps are sobering examples of the ease with which a disaster could be sparked. 'The fact that the grid was down for 45 minutes is extremely alarming, because it means that control was temporarily lost in these crucial nuclear installations,' said Tobias Muenchmeyer, atomic energy expert with Greenpeace. Some commentators linked the initial power cut to the campaign by Russia's electricity monopoly to cut off those customers with outstanding debts. They speculated that by suddenly switching off one area of the grid, Unified Energy Systems might have precipitated the short circuit. UES officials deny this, and a government commission has been set up to investigate. State officials are eager to promote atomic energy as a means of heating and powering their vast country. A strategy document published by Minatom in May advocated that Russia should radically increase its nuclear capacity over the next 20 years, building up to 24 new reactors. Independent experts affirm that over the past five years the number of emergency shutdowns in Russian reactors has dropped fourfold, and over the past two years financing of safety monitoring has increased.

Thanks to the IRA ceasefires, the MoD is being sued for 'breach of contract and negligence'. An Ulster-based construction company has issued a High Court writ against defence chiefs for multimillion-pound damages. J.H. Turkington &amp; Sons of Portadown claims that in December 1992 the company was contracted by the MoD to carry out a huge building programme to protect army and RUC bases in Northern Ireland. The military said that the work was 'urgently required' to fortify army barracks and police stations in response to the threat posed by the IRA's Mark 15 'barrack buster' mortars. At the time the IRA was carrying out an intensified campaign against the security forces with mortar bombs capable of piercing the fortifications around police and army bases. According to the writ, the company, which traded as Northern Builders, was asked by leading army officers to make 'suitable hardened structures' to strengthen security at the bases. The value of the emergency programme was estimated at \u00a3300m and the contract was meant to run for 10 years, the company claims. But then the IRA declared its first ceasefire on 31 August 1994 and three months later the MoD informed the company that the programme was being halted. The company claims that, as a result of the fortification contract being terminated, it is now owed \u00a315m in compensation and expenses for research, redevelopment and tooling. The MoD has filed a defence denying any liability and is also disputing the claim for damages. The case is expected to be heard at Belfast High Court in January, when a senior army officer involved in the original contract returns from a tour of duty in Kosovo. Legal sources in Belfast said that no written contracts had been exchanged between the company and the MoD. At the time the ministry wanted the work done as a matter of urgency, given the IRA's sustained Mark 15 attacks. The programme resulted in some bases having their outer walls fortified. The company also built an inner bunker inside several army and police stations known as 'The Cube', which was constructed to resist heavy mortar blasts. Israeli military engineers were flown in to design the fortifications. They used anti-blast technology they had developed while building military and government bases in Israel, the occupied territories and the former buffer zone in Lebanon. The Mark 15 'barrack buster' mortar was the most devastating weapon in the Provisional IRA's arsenal. A Provo engineer who lives along the South Armagh-Louth border and has since defected to the Real IRA developed it.

At the height of his dependency to the painkiller, taken originally to ease gout, Smith was taking nearly 10 times the maximum dose advised.</p> <p>'It's frightening how easily I became hooked on a drug freely sold over the counter,' he said.

It was set up by David Grieve, a former policeman who was given 12 months to live in 1992 when his 17-year addiction to the cough mixture Phensydyl landed him in intensive care.</p> <p>'I had reached the point where I was drinking 25 to 30 bottles of the stuff every day,' he said.

      "bodyText": "More than 20,000 people in Britain are addicted to drugs available without prescription, such as painkillers and cough mixtures, according to the first national survey into the problem. Young women aged 25 to 35 are most likely to suffer over-the-counter (OTC) addiction: 52 per cent of those who admitted addiction were housewives, 27 per cent were one-parent mothers and a further 21 per cent were professionals who often took up to 75 tablets a day over a four- to five-year period. One-third of the men who admitted dependency were young professionals aged 28 to 35, while 30 per cent were manual workers and 19 per cent were retail staff in the same age range. Mel Smith, the actor and producer, admitted recently that he nearly died after a seven-year addiction to Nurofen Plus, which left him exhausted, depressed and with two leaking stomach ulcers. At the height of his dependency to the painkiller, taken originally to ease gout, Smith was taking nearly 10 times the maximum dose advised. 'It's frightening how easily I became hooked on a drug freely sold over the counter,' he said. 'I swallowed the pills like Smarties. Swallowing 50 tablets in one day was tantamount to committing suicide: I'm very lucky to be alive.' The research, to be published in a book next year, was carried out by Over-Count, a self-help group with more than 9,000 people on its books. It was set up by David Grieve, a former policeman who was given 12 months to live in 1992 when his 17-year addiction to the cough mixture Phensydyl landed him in intensive care. 'I had reached the point where I was drinking 25 to 30 bottles of the stuff every day,' he said. 'I had run up \u00a318,000 in debt, had lost my job and spent my weeks travelling around the country trying to find chemists who would still serve me. I sold my son's Christmas presents so I could buy two bottles.' Grieve began his research in 1997 and was amazed at the extent of the problem. 'Male addicts regularly travel up to 135 miles to buy enough medicine to fuel their addiction,' he said. 'It's an addiction that can hit those who wouldn't consider taking anything harder, which means it affects a wide and as yet completely undefined spectrum of society.' More than 70 per cent of Over-Count's members are women, most addicted to codeine-based painkillers in tablet form. The men are mainly addicted to codeine-based cough and cold mixtures. Long misuse of codeine, a highly addictive opiate in the same family as heroin and morphine, will have a depressant effect on the central nervous system and can cause pancreatitis, dependency and respiratory depression. Grieve questioned 25 pharmacists who listed 21 products, most codeine-based, which they were allowed to sell without prescription, but suspected were frequently abused by customers. A psychiatrist at an NHS Substance Misuse Clinic in Scotland said the numbers of referrals for over-the-counter drug addictions to his clinic had increased by more than 50 per cent in five years. 'We need to address this problem before events overtake us,' he said. 'More and more prescription drugs are being downrated to OTC availability, and I fear the numbers of patients with an OTC addiction will increase correspondingly unless something is done and unless that happens soon.' amelia.hill@observer.co.uk",

Banned passages included a drunken social evening at No 10, a spoof 'poem' by Mary Wilson and four verses of a ribald song about Foreign Secretary George Brown. The play's producers were never told the reason for the six-month delay before the Lord Chamberlain granted a licence in September 1967.

Until a real effort is made in this regard... the prophylactic is one of the ways to \"contain\" the sexual transmission of HIV and Aids.'</p> <p>The move has sent shockwaves through the church.

'L'Osservatore has become a platform for the exploration of issues on which there might be a change in the official line of the Vatican at some point in the future.'</p> <p>Suaudeau is careful to emphasise that traditional monogamy is his preferred method of Aids prevention. 'Family values guarantee true human victory,' he claims. 'Wherever there is true education in the values of the family, of fidelity, of marital chastity, man will achieve a human victory, even over this terrible phenomenon. There is no hope of halting the HIV epidemic with condoms alone, just as there is no hope of preventing a river from flooding by using sandbags when the main dykes have collapsed.'</p> <p>But his acknowledgement that condoms may be part of a strategy to prevent HIV is a stark departure for the church.</p> <p>In the Sixties a pontifical commission on contraception recommended that Rome should lift its ban on artificial birth control. Catholics had expected Pope Paul VI to accept that recommendation. Instead, when he published his encyclical Humane Vitae he stoutly rejected any change.</p> <p>Suaudeau's latest suggestion is consistent with accepted Catholic teaching on use of the birth control pill, which is permitted to correct severe menstrual irregularities, even though it also prevents conception.</p> <p>Lisa Power, of British HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'We welcome anything that goes towards recognising the reality of the HIV epidemic.

      "bodyText": "The Vatican has given a clear signal that it is considering softening its historic opposition to the use of condoms. A leading member of the influential Pontifical Council on the Family has admitted that condom use may be the 'lesser of two evils' as the Roman Catholic church acknowledges the extent of the global Aids epidemic. In the Vatican-published L'Osservatore Romano, Monsignor Jacques Suaudeau writes: 'If people want to prevent Aids, they must be convinced to change their sexual behaviour. Until a real effort is made in this regard... the prophylactic is one of the ways to \"contain\" the sexual transmission of HIV and Aids.' The move has sent shockwaves through the church. 'This is very significant,' said a spokesman for Britain's Catholic media office yesterday. 'L'Osservatore has become a platform for the exploration of issues on which there might be a change in the official line of the Vatican at some point in the future.' Suaudeau is careful to emphasise that traditional monogamy is his preferred method of Aids prevention. 'Family values guarantee true human victory,' he claims. 'Wherever there is true education in the values of the family, of fidelity, of marital chastity, man will achieve a human victory, even over this terrible phenomenon. There is no hope of halting the HIV epidemic with condoms alone, just as there is no hope of preventing a river from flooding by using sandbags when the main dykes have collapsed.' But his acknowledgement that condoms may be part of a strategy to prevent HIV is a stark departure for the church. In the Sixties a pontifical commission on contraception recommended that Rome should lift its ban on artificial birth control. Catholics had expected Pope Paul VI to accept that recommendation. Instead, when he published his encyclical Humane Vitae he stoutly rejected any change. Suaudeau's latest suggestion is consistent with accepted Catholic teaching on use of the birth control pill, which is permitted to correct severe menstrual irregularities, even though it also prevents conception. Lisa Power, of British HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'We welcome anything that goes towards recognising the reality of the HIV epidemic. It is also good news for Catholic couples, of course.'",

      "body": "<p>The grounds of Indiana University last week looked more like a foreign enclave under the shaky protection of UN peacekeepers than one of America's most beautiful state colleges.</p> <p>A 3,000-strong mob of students surged from one end of the campus to the other, breaking off into smaller packs and leaving a trail of havoc in their wake. In scenes reminiscent of both Tehran in 1978 and nearby Martinsville (once headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan) in 1925, pictures of hated personalities were burnt and effigies lynched and torched.</p> <p>Hundreds of police officers in riot gear tore through the streets on foot and in cars. Charging past the museum, the students twice tried to storm the university president's house.</p> <p>Though US campuses once took pride in their political protests, it is rare to see one today. Last Sunday was not one of those days. What had caused this riot was not politics, but athletics: an announcement made earlier in the day that Bob Knight, the school's basketball coach of 29 years, had been fired.</p> <p>While Americans are notoriously spirited when it comes to sport, the US is devoid of anything resembling football hooligans. But in the state of Indiana - and the world of college basketball, whose centre of gravity is Indiana (the HQ of the National Collegiate Athletic Association is up the road in Indianapolis) - Bob Knight is Alex Ferguson.</p> <p>He embodies both the state and its indigenous sport. Though he has not won an NCAA national championship since 1987, he has delivered three such titles to Indiana University over three decades - more than any other coach. Save for North Carolina's now retired Dean Smith, no coach has won as many games as Knight. He presided over the 1984 US men's Olympic basketball team, which took the gold. He has been widely praised for running a programme that does not quietly pay players or their families, has no patience for prima donna players and extols the virtue of teamwork.</p> <p>But, say his critics, pointing to how few of his players have gone on to professional success, Knight's methods are also self-serving, because there is room in his programme for only one centre of attention: himself.</p> <p>Indeed, Knight's career has been one of the most controversial in American athletics, owing largely to what even his partisans see as an anger-management problem. In 1979, while serving as US coach at the Pan American games, he was convicted in abstentia in Puerto Rico for hitting a police officer. In 1985, angered by a referee's call, he registered his displeasure by hurling a chair across a basketball court.

      "bodyText": "The grounds of Indiana University last week looked more like a foreign enclave under the shaky protection of UN peacekeepers than one of America's most beautiful state colleges. A 3,000-strong mob of students surged from one end of the campus to the other, breaking off into smaller packs and leaving a trail of havoc in their wake. In scenes reminiscent of both Tehran in 1978 and nearby Martinsville (once headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan) in 1925, pictures of hated personalities were burnt and effigies lynched and torched. Hundreds of police officers in riot gear tore through the streets on foot and in cars. Charging past the museum, the students twice tried to storm the university president's house. Though US campuses once took pride in their political protests, it is rare to see one today. Last Sunday was not one of those days. What had caused this riot was not politics, but athletics: an announcement made earlier in the day that Bob Knight, the school's basketball coach of 29 years, had been fired. While Americans are notoriously spirited when it comes to sport, the US is devoid of anything resembling football hooligans. But in the state of Indiana - and the world of college basketball, whose centre of gravity is Indiana (the HQ of the National Collegiate Athletic Association is up the road in Indianapolis) - Bob Knight is Alex Ferguson. He embodies both the state and its indigenous sport. Though he has not won an NCAA national championship since 1987, he has delivered three such titles to Indiana University over three decades - more than any other coach. Save for North Carolina's now retired Dean Smith, no coach has won as many games as Knight. He presided over the 1984 US men's Olympic basketball team, which took the gold. He has been widely praised for running a programme that does not quietly pay players or their families, has no patience for prima donna players and extols the virtue of teamwork. But, say his critics, pointing to how few of his players have gone on to professional success, Knight's methods are also self-serving, because there is room in his programme for only one centre of attention: himself. Indeed, Knight's career has been one of the most controversial in American athletics, owing largely to what even his partisans see as an anger-management problem. In 1979, while serving as US coach at the Pan American games, he was convicted in abstentia in Puerto Rico for hitting a police officer. In 1985, angered by a referee's call, he registered his displeasure by hurling a chair across a basketball court. 'He ran a good programme, but everyone has known for a long time that he's foul-mouthed and lets his anger get the best of him,' said Matthew Huff, a 25-year-old English student. Knight, recipient of scores of game ejections and costly fines for his tongue-lashing of referees, was the subject of a university investigation earlier this year which concluded that he had engaged in a pattern of inappropriate actions - including choking one player - and could only stay at the university if he accepted a $30,000 fine, a three-game suspension and adherence to a 'zero tolerance' conduct policy. In May, he indicated his understanding and commitment. But last Sunday - after university president Myles Brand fired Knight for a series of actions at odds with their agreement, the latest of which involved Knight manhandling a student and lecturing him for failing to address him as 'Mr' or 'Coach' - the extent to which Knight represents the dark side of the American maverick mythology was on full display as students ran roughshod over their university. Knight's appeal to Hoosiers (Indiana natives) has always been his disdain for authority, and the visceral joy his outbursts bring: even when fined huge sums, both Knight and his fans know the simple-living coach can afford them. Like most populist politicians, Knight has played to his constituency, and even in lacklustre seasons, has been enthusiastically supported, because of what he represents: winning his way, and never bending before referees or administrators when he believes he's right. Many of the faculty at the university have long found Knight's cult of personality disturbing. In essence, it revolves around the right to act with impunity. Unlike virtually every other coach, Knight never had to report to the university's athletic director. His hold over his students was revealed last Sunday evening as he emerged to succeed in doing what hours of policing had failed to achieve: ending the riot with a five-minute, off-the-cuff speech. Bloodied but unbowed, he told the cable sports station ESPN that, while he accepted his dismissal, he was not finished with college ball yet; as he repeatedly insulted and rebuked the interviewer, the crowd at Nick's, a local tavern, cheered. And last Wednesday he appeared on a small platform in Dunn Meadow, next to the university's gargantuan student union building, swarmed by an equally enormous crowd of approximately 10,000 students and supporters. His farewell - covering everything from an appeal to participate in a cancer research fundraiser, to stinging criticisms of the administrators who fired him, to gracious thanks for student support - was often punctuated with cheers and applause. As news and police helicopters hovered overhead, he asked students to bow their heads in a moment of silence to wish him well, and with that, left the stage.",

      "bodyText": "Scientists have developed a way to vaccinate people against crippling immune disorders that include multiple sclerosis. If early trials are successful, researchers say nasal sprays could soon be used to provide protection against MS as well as illnesses like diabetes, severe allergies and arthritis. 'We are on the brink of tackling immune disorders in a new, highly specific manner,' said David Wraith, whose Bristol University team is about to begin trials of an MS vaccine. 'This is a very exciting time.' A similar vaccine, against cat allergens, has been developed by Barry Kay and Mark Larche, at Imperial College, London, and has already proved successful in early trials. 'We have now completed a larger clinical study and early analysis of results again look very promising,' said Kay. The key to the new approach involves re-educating the body's immune system so that it no longer attacks its own tissue or triggers disruptive counter-attacks when it encounters relatively harmless chemicals or microbes. 'This technique is the exact opposite of normal vaccination, which involves using pieces of protein from a microbe to stimulate the body's immune defences in anticipation of a future invasion by complete bacteria or viruses,' said Jonathan Lamb, of Edinburgh University. 'Instead, we are using protein pieces - called peptides - to convince the body's immune system that it is dealing with something harmless and doesn't have to arm itself or launch an attack.' Lamb, working with Gerry Hoyne, has used a peptide isolated from the faeces of dust mites. 'These creatures are ubiquitous,' said Hoyne. 'They live in our homes and beds, eat flakes of our skin and then leave faecal particles all over the place.

Oh, if only I could say it with a straight face. My own reasons for seeking out a phone coach are a lot less dignified. My problem, you might say, is that I am the problem.</p> <p>I am the perfect global worker: owned by no one, making it up as I go along, and never not working. Last year I wrote more than a hundred articles, for more than 10 papers. I live in Bath, but spent two days a week in Coventry, teaching creative writing. And I wrote a book, and there was only one joke in it.</p> <p>People were always telling me how awful I made them feel for doing less. They said they could not work out where I found the time.

It helped me overcome a crippling case of writer's block and was the perfect antidote to the lonely back room where I was still writing my novels. I started teaching at around the same time, and I loved that too. But I did not have to push myself very hard. My shift into overdrive happened in my early forties, when I woke up one morning to find I was the main breadwinner for a family of six that expanded to eight on alternate weekends.</p> <p>That was about eight years ago. I have kept things going by working on what you might call an emergency basis. An assignment came in, and I dropped everything until it was done. The moment it was done, there was another emergency, and then another. The non-emergencies I would leave for a day when I had no emergencies, but that day hardly ever arrived. I could go for a year without filing. I did go for years without an address book, relying on six diaries which were never where I remembered putting them. I seemed to spend half my life looking for an important piece of paper. I failed to pay my taxes on time because I could not find the bill.</p> <p>Three things bothered me a lot more than living in financial chaos. One was that I was having so little time with the family in whose name I was supposed to be doing all this. The other was that I was losing friends, because many of them could not believe I had not been in touch for nine months because I had not had time to find the notebook with their number in it. Then there was my study. I would walk into it in the morning and survey the overstuffed drawers and overloaded power points and bulging accordion files, the leaning towers of unfiled paper, the stacks of unread books, and I would feel as if I was looking at the inside of my head.</p> <p>So you can understand why my ears perked up when a friend who had had similar problems told me she had been 'sorted' by a phone coach. I decided to give it a try.</p> <p>The first coach I went to decided we were not a good match. After hearing my tragedy, she said that if she took me on the first thing she would want to do was change my attitude to work, 'and I sense you don't want that'. She was right, the very idea terrified me. She suggested I try a man named Mark Forster, who liked to 'get his teeth into time problems'.

I enjoyed every minute of my work-related whinge, and I was very pleased when, at the end, he said, yes, there was 'a lot to be getting on with' and suggested we set a time the following week for our first session. Then came my homework, which was to make a list of all the things I hoped to achieve if we continued to confer for three months and email it to him.</p> <p>This I did. Then, at the appointed hour, I rang him on his coaching line, and he greeted me by name before I said hello. We immediately moved on to a discussion of my goals, which ranged from the impossible - sorting out my address, file, tax record, and tax payment problems, to the unthinkable - balancing my workload so that my various jobs did not collide and ruin my home life, and finding time for friends. The impossible items were, he assured me, do-able. I could not count on having my home life back or my friends flocking back to forgive me within that timeframe, but I could make some progress in that direction.</p> <p>He moved on swiftly to address the case of the missing addresses, outlining the system he used.

I got up from my desk, marched straight into another black hole, the bathroom/utility room, and did a full spring clean. Then I went back to my study and decided to buy a laptop. This pattern repeated itself the next week, when I received instruction on files. It happened again when we moved on to money management.

The 90-year old Girl Guide movement, whose most famous members were once the Queen and Princess Margaret, is to be kitted out in designer gear as part of a radical overhaul of a group which once knitted socks for First World War servicemen.</p> <p>From next month, embroidery will be gone forever. In come circus skills and faith awareness. New training will focus on music, fitness and fundraising.</p> <p>Special information on current issues like healthy eating and bullying is to be included in guiding literature. And leaders will encourage girls to help design their own activity programmes rather than simply following instructions.</p> <p>Badges will be attached with Velcro to a string of new uniform items, created by the catwalk designer Ally Capellino. Capellino has been a favourite of high-profile clients including actress Jane Horrocks and Cherie Booth.</p> <p>The new look for Britain's 700,000 Guides can be worn to Guide meetings with badges or worn badge-free to discos or parties. The designer range will be unveiled this week.</p> <p>'We're well aware that we're now in competition with home entertainment and multi-media activity,' said Terry Ryall, chief executive of the Guide Association. 'We want to deliver what girls want as well as educational objectives. That has meant a redevelopment of our entire programme.'</p> <p>Even Guide patrols, once called Forget-me-not or Swallow after favourite flowers and birds, are to be renamed. Guides will be able to choose the names of countries of origin or endangered animals instead. A team leader badge will require girls to demonstrate communication skills, including how to deal with conflict and how to give appropriate feedback.</p> <p>In circus skills, girls will have to master three activities from a list which includes acrobatics, juggling and unicycling. A film lover's badge will require an understanding of what a storyboard is and what a 'best boy' does on a film set.</p> <p>In a departure from the once overtly patriotic history of the Guide movement, girls will also carry out activities designed to foster international understanding. 'Peace can be the end of war,' says one promotional poster. 'If we all make an effort, the world could be a more peaceful place.'</p> <p>Lynnie Hutchison, a Guide leader from East Sussex, said: 'We are already much more modern than many people think. But some of my Guides admit that they don't use the G-word at school. They just say they went on a mountain-biking weekend, but they don't say who with.</p> <p>'That means other girls miss out on what they could be doing. That should change if our new programme succeeds in changing perceptions. It's a great shame that teenage peer pressure sometimes puts girls off.'</p> <p>Radio 4 presenter Jenni Murray, a former Guide, said: 'Guiding was the best thing that happened to me in my teenage years. It taught me how to be a really responsible, sensible leader. I didn't even mind the marching. If Guides are demonstrating that they are modernising their image, that's great. Anything during the teenage years which means that girls can meet and have a common aim is good. I was able to be brave and strong and climb trees, all things I would never have done with boys around.'</p> <p>The number of Guides has grown as the organisation has experimented with new ranges of outdoor activities during the last decade, but the number of Scouts has stayed at 450,000 since girl Scouts were first admitted in 1991. Just 6 per cent of Scouts are now female.</p> <p>Hutchison, a farmer by trade, said: 'Nowadays at school girls are under more and more pressure to do what boys want and wear what they think they should.</p> <p>'They have said that they want their own time together. They still want somewhere to go where they don't have to worry about boys. They will sometimes invite boys to events, but they want to do it on their own terms.'</p> <p>Lord Baden-Powell, legendary hero of the siege of Mafeking, founded the Guides in 1910, after girls had tried unsuccessfully to join his fledgling Scout Association. The first Guide Handbook - How Girls Can Help Build Up the Empire - was published shortly afterwards.</p> <p>Just over half of all women in the United Kingdom have been Girl Guides during their childhood. The movement's former members include Kate Adie, Emma Thompson, Julie Burchill and Mo Mowlam. Cherie Booth was once a Guide leader.</p> <p>The Guides will also launch a recruitment programme this week for new leaders to join their current 70,000 adult helpers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Olave Baden-Powell, the wife of the founder of the Girl Guides and a woman of resolutely conservative taste, would be shocked. The 90-year old Girl Guide movement, whose most famous members were once the Queen and Princess Margaret, is to be kitted out in designer gear as part of a radical overhaul of a group which once knitted socks for First World War servicemen. From next month, embroidery will be gone forever. In come circus skills and faith awareness. New training will focus on music, fitness and fundraising. Special information on current issues like healthy eating and bullying is to be included in guiding literature. And leaders will encourage girls to help design their own activity programmes rather than simply following instructions. Badges will be attached with Velcro to a string of new uniform items, created by the catwalk designer Ally Capellino. Capellino has been a favourite of high-profile clients including actress Jane Horrocks and Cherie Booth. The new look for Britain's 700,000 Guides can be worn to Guide meetings with badges or worn badge-free to discos or parties. The designer range will be unveiled this week. 'We're well aware that we're now in competition with home entertainment and multi-media activity,' said Terry Ryall, chief executive of the Guide Association. 'We want to deliver what girls want as well as educational objectives. That has meant a redevelopment of our entire programme.' Even Guide patrols, once called Forget-me-not or Swallow after favourite flowers and birds, are to be renamed. Guides will be able to choose the names of countries of origin or endangered animals instead. A team leader badge will require girls to demonstrate communication skills, including how to deal with conflict and how to give appropriate feedback. In circus skills, girls will have to master three activities from a list which includes acrobatics, juggling and unicycling. A film lover's badge will require an understanding of what a storyboard is and what a 'best boy' does on a film set. In a departure from the once overtly patriotic history of the Guide movement, girls will also carry out activities designed to foster international understanding. 'Peace can be the end of war,' says one promotional poster. 'If we all make an effort, the world could be a more peaceful place.' Lynnie Hutchison, a Guide leader from East Sussex, said: 'We are already much more modern than many people think. But some of my Guides admit that they don't use the G-word at school. They just say they went on a mountain-biking weekend, but they don't say who with. 'That means other girls miss out on what they could be doing. That should change if our new programme succeeds in changing perceptions. It's a great shame that teenage peer pressure sometimes puts girls off.' Radio 4 presenter Jenni Murray, a former Guide, said: 'Guiding was the best thing that happened to me in my teenage years. It taught me how to be a really responsible, sensible leader. I didn't even mind the marching. If Guides are demonstrating that they are modernising their image, that's great. Anything during the teenage years which means that girls can meet and have a common aim is good. I was able to be brave and strong and climb trees, all things I would never have done with boys around.' The number of Guides has grown as the organisation has experimented with new ranges of outdoor activities during the last decade, but the number of Scouts has stayed at 450,000 since girl Scouts were first admitted in 1991. Just 6 per cent of Scouts are now female. Hutchison, a farmer by trade, said: 'Nowadays at school girls are under more and more pressure to do what boys want and wear what they think they should. 'They have said that they want their own time together. They still want somewhere to go where they don't have to worry about boys. They will sometimes invite boys to events, but they want to do it on their own terms.' Lord Baden-Powell, legendary hero of the siege of Mafeking, founded the Guides in 1910, after girls had tried unsuccessfully to join his fledgling Scout Association. The first Guide Handbook - How Girls Can Help Build Up the Empire - was published shortly afterwards. Just over half of all women in the United Kingdom have been Girl Guides during their childhood. The movement's former members include Kate Adie, Emma Thompson, Julie Burchill and Mo Mowlam. Cherie Booth was once a Guide leader. The Guides will also launch a recruitment programme this week for new leaders to join their current 70,000 adult helpers.",

      "body": "<p>At a dinner party last week, I was asked to tell the other guests more about my work. Although I tried to skirt around the subject, not wishing to monopolise the conversation, my fellow guests insisted that I at least tell them what my patients most commonly see me for. You may guess that I primarily see people who are overweight, but this isn't so.</p> <p>I actually spend more time treating people who have a whole raft of health problems, largely resulting from the fact that they simply don't eat properly, and not just in terms of the foods that they consume - something like 90 per cent of the people I see have problems because they eat too quickly, and in a manner that prevents them from gleaning the maximum benefit from food.</p> <p>More often than not, meal times are rushed affairs: a croissant is bought while running for the bus, a sandwich is devoured at the desk, while a TV dinner or bowl of pasta downed before crashing into bed are the most likely evening scenarios. Society seems to collude in encouraging such unhealthy eating patterns, too, with schools that urge their pupils to consume lunch in 10 minutes flat and our long working hours forcing us to ignore our hunger pangs to the point of having to eat as soon as possible after arriving home at the end of a punishing day. All in all, eating has become a joyless procedure that we tend to rush rather than savour.</p> <p>Before taking you through the physiological aspects of the appetite mechanism, it's important to note that changing how you eat is not an easy task (I compare it to learning to ride a bike: you'll get the hang of it for a few seconds and then you'll fall off, discouraging you from trying again). But if you're determined to conquer bad eating habits, you will reap immeasurable rewards. As soon as you start eating in a way that assists your body in knowing when it's had enough, and also helps it to digest food efficiently, then the final part of the puzzle - eating health-giving foods - will slot smoothly into place. If you eat well in the basic sense - that is, chew food properly and in a manner that aids digestion - nutrients will be enabled to begin to work on improving your general wellbeing. But do remember, in the majority of cases, abandoning the habit of wolfing down food without really registering what you're eating will take weeks rather than days, so give yourself time.</p> <p>Your body initially takes in valuable information about food through the nose and eyes. Aromas from cooking and the inviting appearance of food on a plate - say fresh figs wrapped in their individual paper, or cheese nestled in an enticing box - all encourage your sensory organs to send anticipatory signals to your hypothalamus (the part of the brain that recognises hunger and satiety), which prepares your body for the prospect of feeling satisfyingly full. Present food in an appealing way, because if it looks tempting, you'll derive maximum satisfaction from it. Rather than grabbing a chunk of unappetising food as you pass the fridge, make yourself stop what you are doing and take the time to appreciate food, lay the table and arrange some food on an attractive plate, even if you're only having a snack.</p> <p>Both the taste and feel of food in your mouth will stimulate your appetite and encourage greater satiety. If you regularly eat similar foods, or have more than a couple of consecutive mouthfuls of the same food, the hypothalamus will register very little satisfaction. By contrast, if you mix interesting flavours with varying temperatures and textures within a meal (by following a mouthful of chicken with one of salad or roasted vegetables, for example), your brain will respond to these multiple stimuli and will tell you when you've eaten enough. The foods that offer the highest satisfaction value are therefore those that have several organoleptic properties - in other words, they stimulate more than one sense: they smell good, look good, feel good in the mouth and taste good.</p> <p>If you eat quickly, your digestive system has very little time to manufacture the enzymes and acids that are needed to break down the food that it receives into easily absorbed particles, making you prone to indigestion and other digestive disorders. Chewing your food too rapidly also means that you are depriving yourself of another means of judging whether you are full or still hungry. When you chew, stretch receptors within the jaw send their responses to the brain, so the more you chew, and the more time you take over eating, the greater your brain's perception of satiety. Take short breaks during the course of a meal and have small mouthfuls of food, punctuated by sips of water to refresh the palate, all of which will intensify the next flavours that your tastebuds detect, resulting in a significant impact on your hypothalamus.</p> <p>Some interesting research recently suggested that the bodies of some obese people may be deficient in leptin, a protein that assists the brain to recognise when it's full, with the result that they carry on eating because they don't feel satiated. This theory doesn't appear to stand up, however, as not only do the bodies of other overweight people produce significant quantities of leptin, but in my professional experience, confirmed by letters that I have received from readers, the majority of people can train themselves to change their eating habits for the better and are then to feel full when they should.</p> <p>Because my Bodyfoods healthy-eating lifestyle enables you to eat the foods you love, but also to know when you've had enough, you shouldn't put on weight or develop digestive problems. Given time, most people will find that they will derive greater satisfaction from their food, as well as from the eating experience as a whole, if they understand the physiological aspects of their appetite mechanisms and adjust their eating habits accordingly.</p>",

I actually spend more time treating people who have a whole raft of health problems, largely resulting from the fact that they simply don't eat properly, and not just in terms of the foods that they consume - something like 90 per cent of the people I see have problems because they eat too quickly, and in a manner that prevents them from gleaning the maximum benefit from food. More often than not, meal times are rushed affairs: a croissant is bought while running for the bus, a sandwich is devoured at the desk, while a TV dinner or bowl of pasta downed before crashing into bed are the most likely evening scenarios. Society seems to collude in encouraging such unhealthy eating patterns, too, with schools that urge their pupils to consume lunch in 10 minutes flat and our long working hours forcing us to ignore our hunger pangs to the point of having to eat as soon as possible after arriving home at the end of a punishing day. All in all, eating has become a joyless procedure that we tend to rush rather than savour. Before taking you through the physiological aspects of the appetite mechanism, it's important to note that changing how you eat is not an easy task (I compare it to learning to ride a bike: you'll get the hang of it for a few seconds and then you'll fall off, discouraging you from trying again). But if you're determined to conquer bad eating habits, you will reap immeasurable rewards. As soon as you start eating in a way that assists your body in knowing when it's had enough, and also helps it to digest food efficiently, then the final part of the puzzle - eating health-giving foods - will slot smoothly into place. If you eat well in the basic sense - that is, chew food properly and in a manner that aids digestion - nutrients will be enabled to begin to work on improving your general wellbeing. But do remember, in the majority of cases, abandoning the habit of wolfing down food without really registering what you're eating will take weeks rather than days, so give yourself time. Your body initially takes in valuable information about food through the nose and eyes. Aromas from cooking and the inviting appearance of food on a plate - say fresh figs wrapped in their individual paper, or cheese nestled in an enticing box - all encourage your sensory organs to send anticipatory signals to your hypothalamus (the part of the brain that recognises hunger and satiety), which prepares your body for the prospect of feeling satisfyingly full. Present food in an appealing way, because if it looks tempting, you'll derive maximum satisfaction from it. Rather than grabbing a chunk of unappetising food as you pass the fridge, make yourself stop what you are doing and take the time to appreciate food, lay the table and arrange some food on an attractive plate, even if you're only having a snack. Both the taste and feel of food in your mouth will stimulate your appetite and encourage greater satiety. If you regularly eat similar foods, or have more than a couple of consecutive mouthfuls of the same food, the hypothalamus will register very little satisfaction. By contrast, if you mix interesting flavours with varying temperatures and textures within a meal (by following a mouthful of chicken with one of salad or roasted vegetables, for example), your brain will respond to these multiple stimuli and will tell you when you've eaten enough. The foods that offer the highest satisfaction value are therefore those that have several organoleptic properties - in other words, they stimulate more than one sense: they smell good, look good, feel good in the mouth and taste good. If you eat quickly, your digestive system has very little time to manufacture the enzymes and acids that are needed to break down the food that it receives into easily absorbed particles, making you prone to indigestion and other digestive disorders. Chewing your food too rapidly also means that you are depriving yourself of another means of judging whether you are full or still hungry. When you chew, stretch receptors within the jaw send their responses to the brain, so the more you chew, and the more time you take over eating, the greater your brain's perception of satiety. Take short breaks during the course of a meal and have small mouthfuls of food, punctuated by sips of water to refresh the palate, all of which will intensify the next flavours that your tastebuds detect, resulting in a significant impact on your hypothalamus. Some interesting research recently suggested that the bodies of some obese people may be deficient in leptin, a protein that assists the brain to recognise when it's full, with the result that they carry on eating because they don't feel satiated. This theory doesn't appear to stand up, however, as not only do the bodies of other overweight people produce significant quantities of leptin, but in my professional experience, confirmed by letters that I have received from readers, the majority of people can train themselves to change their eating habits for the better and are then to feel full when they should. Because my Bodyfoods healthy-eating lifestyle enables you to eat the foods you love, but also to know when you've had enough, you shouldn't put on weight or develop digestive problems. Given time, most people will find that they will derive greater satisfaction from their food, as well as from the eating experience as a whole, if they understand the physiological aspects of their appetite mechanisms and adjust their eating habits accordingly.",

Des says ruefully: 'We should have invested the money immediately in something like a Pep but we have two sons and teenagers are an expensive item.' </p> <p>Now Des is about to inherit \u00a322,000 from his late mother. This means he could pay off his current car loan of \u00a311,000 which runs until 2004 but is reluctant to do so because of his previous experience. He will, though, pay off the \u00a32,000 debt on his credit card. </p> <p>Mainly he wants to use the inheritance to help his two sons, Andrew and David, with the huge expense of university. Andrew could go to university next year and David four years later: 'We want them to get through university without having too big a millstone round their necks at the end. But we also want to avoid having to cut our cloth a bit tighter.' </p> <p>He does not know how much the university education might cost but would like advice on where to invest for it: 'I don't think we can tie the money up for five years in stock market investments but putting it in a savings account doesn't seem very efficient.' </p> <p>Des started work as a civil servant in the DSS but says: 'I could see where the money was.' He did a year's IT training course and stayed in the civil service for a while but then moved out: 'IT civil servants are better paid than most but they are not as well paid as in industry and commerce.' </p> <p>He has been in a money purchase pension scheme since April, to which he makes Additional Voluntary Contributions of 5 per cent, and has 24 years contributions in another final salary scheme. </p> <p>Until two years ago, Des and Julie had a endowment mortgage but, when they heard there might be a \u00a33,000 shortfall, switched to a \u00a370,000 repayment loan which ends in 12 years. The endowment policy will give them about \u00a343,000. </p> <p>Their investments are \u00a34,000 in a building society, \u00a31,000 in Premium Bonds and 200 shares in Manchester United which, says Des, is more of an emotional investment than a financial one. 'I might as well have bought 10 shares, or one, if I wanted to be a shareholder but at least they have gone up about \u00a31.30 a share since I bought.' </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Neil Bailey</strong></p> <p>Des and Julie should repay the credit cards and the car loan from the inheritance. The car loan costs 8 per cent net and they would need 10 per cent from a deposit account to justify not repaying it. I suggest they set up a standing order to a deposit account, earmarked for university costs, to save the amount that they would have spent on credit payments so the money will not be available to spend. Saving \u00a3390 a month gives them \u00a34,680 plus interest by the time their first son goes to university. With the balance of the inheritance - \u00a39,600 - they have a total \u00a314,280 plus interest. It is vital that they establish a budget for the cost of educating both sons . They can expect to pay \u00a38,000 a year each if they study in London and \u00a36,500 elsewhere, before extra costs such as paying for an active social life. </p> <p>Assuming the elder son studies outside London, he will need, say, \u00a36,500 a year. If he takes a Student Loan of \u00a33,445, this leaves a shortfall of \u00a33,055 for the parents to find. They could save \u00a33,960 from repaying the loans so they should be able to cover the further education costs without a negative impact on their current standard of living. </p> <p>They could use a combination of cash and investment ISAs investing in corporate bond funds to put their savings into a tax shelter. Corporate bond funds do not guarantee protection of the capital but they can provide high yields - headline yields of 9 per cent are available. </p> <p>Neil Bailey works for The Sensible Financial Planning Co in Winslow. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Carolyn Corless</strong></p> <p>Paying for university will take priority over saving for Des and Julie's retirement for the next few years and, with only a modest capital sum, most of the education costs will have to be met from current income. They should avoid investments that tie up their capital for the long term and go for cash investments. Des might think this inefficient but their options are limited by the short timescale. </p> <p>They should repay the credit card debt and the car loan, providing there are no penalties. I understand their reasons for not repaying the loan but the interest payments could be better used to fund education. If they divert the loan costs into an instant access account by standing order, they should avoid being tempted to spend the cash. </p> <p>Nationwide's Internet account pays 7 per cent; Bristol &amp; West's post/ phone account 6.85 per cent. The Brownings should calculate how much they can save over the next year and then use part of the inheritance to top up this account to cover the first year's university cost. They could also invest in a fixed rate bond; Northern Rock is paying 7.25 per cent gross. </p> <p>They should both invest \u00a33,000 in a cash ISA. Smile pays 7.25 per cent on its internet-based ISA account; Alliance &amp; Leicester pays 7 per cent gross on its phone/postal ISA. </p> <p>The existing savings should be retained as an emergency fund. </p> <p>Carolyn Corless works for Sully's Financial Planning, Bideford. </p> <p> Advice is for guidance only.</p>",

Assuming the elder son studies outside London, he will need, say, \u00a36,500 a year. If he takes a Student Loan of \u00a33,445, this leaves a shortfall of \u00a33,055 for the parents to find. They could save \u00a33,960 from repaying the loans so they should be able to cover the further education costs without a negative impact on their current standard of living. They could use a combination of cash and investment ISAs investing in corporate bond funds to put their savings into a tax shelter. Corporate bond funds do not guarantee protection of the capital but they can provide high yields - headline yields of 9 per cent are available. Neil Bailey works for The Sensible Financial Planning Co in Winslow. Adviser 2: Carolyn Corless Paying for university will take priority over saving for Des and Julie's retirement for the next few years and, with only a modest capital sum, most of the education costs will have to be met from current income. They should avoid investments that tie up their capital for the long term and go for cash investments. Des might think this inefficient but their options are limited by the short timescale. They should repay the credit card debt and the car loan, providing there are no penalties. I understand their reasons for not repaying the loan but the interest payments could be better used to fund education. If they divert the loan costs into an instant access account by standing order, they should avoid being tempted to spend the cash. Nationwide's Internet account pays 7 per cent; Bristol &amp; West's post/ phone account 6.85 per cent. The Brownings should calculate how much they can save over the next year and then use part of the inheritance to top up this account to cover the first year's university cost. They could also invest in a fixed rate bond; Northern Rock is paying 7.25 per cent gross. They should both invest \u00a33,000 in a cash ISA. Smile pays 7.25 per cent on its internet-based ISA account; Alliance &amp; Leicester pays 7 per cent gross on its phone/postal ISA. The existing savings should be retained as an emergency fund.

      "body": "<p>I love September. I love the chill mornings and the hot midday sun, and the garden loves it, too. We came back from holiday to find the garden in a surpsingly soft, benign mood - a little boring but a gentle place to be. I think of September as a month of fruit, box cuttings, sunflowers, fennel, leonotis, zinnias, cosmos, tobacco plants, Clematis viticella 'Purpurea Plena Elegans' and sweetcorn. The cabbages become bulky, and dew, hawthorne, willow and field maple are all yellowing and there's a dusty well-worn feeling, like an old shoe, that is somehow so much more attractive than August's tired valiance.</p> <p>I left for holiday feeling disillusioned with the garden but have returned with fresh impetus. My main concern is to simplify the place. I want less of the cluttered, busy mass of English borders and more of the rigorous blocks and spaces which feel American or European to me. Pretentious? Who cares? The one place that you can pretend anything is in your garden. It is, after all, only a game.</p> <p>The first stage will be to create new raised beds in the orchard for veg, and to use space in the existing veg garden for simpler blocks of crops. I will also remove all the woven hazel fences from around the vegetable beds and replace them with oak boards with a box hedge.</p> <p>I have been blaming slugs and snails for the past two months for eating our tomatoes. Dozens have been gnawed into, starting with a hole which is then raggedly widened around the softer edges. The beefsteak tomatoes, such as 'Marmande', were worst hit. My hatred for slugs tightened another notch.</p> <p>But I owe the slugs an apology. Yesterday I walked into the tunnel and discovered half a dozen of our hens happily pecking away at the tomatoes. A light clicked on in the dim recesses of my frontal lobes. It was them all along. The bastards! Seething, I went into full-blown Basil Fawlty mode, frogmarching them back to their run. As if my life wasn't complicated enough.</p> <p>Anyone who keeps hens knows each egg costs about as much as a dozen prime, organic, free-range eggs from a supermarket and that they demand constant attention. At bottom they are vile, malicious creatures. So Tom and I made screens to go across the greenhouse and tunnel doors, to keep hens out, and to let the ventilation and lovely, harmless slugs in.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I love September. I love the chill mornings and the hot midday sun, and the garden loves it, too. We came back from holiday to find the garden in a surpsingly soft, benign mood - a little boring but a gentle place to be. I think of September as a month of fruit, box cuttings, sunflowers, fennel, leonotis, zinnias, cosmos, tobacco plants, Clematis viticella 'Purpurea Plena Elegans' and sweetcorn. The cabbages become bulky, and dew, hawthorne, willow and field maple are all yellowing and there's a dusty well-worn feeling, like an old shoe, that is somehow so much more attractive than August's tired valiance. I left for holiday feeling disillusioned with the garden but have returned with fresh impetus. My main concern is to simplify the place. I want less of the cluttered, busy mass of English borders and more of the rigorous blocks and spaces which feel American or European to me. Pretentious? Who cares? The one place that you can pretend anything is in your garden. It is, after all, only a game. The first stage will be to create new raised beds in the orchard for veg, and to use space in the existing veg garden for simpler blocks of crops. I will also remove all the woven hazel fences from around the vegetable beds and replace them with oak boards with a box hedge. I have been blaming slugs and snails for the past two months for eating our tomatoes. Dozens have been gnawed into, starting with a hole which is then raggedly widened around the softer edges. The beefsteak tomatoes, such as 'Marmande', were worst hit. My hatred for slugs tightened another notch. But I owe the slugs an apology. Yesterday I walked into the tunnel and discovered half a dozen of our hens happily pecking away at the tomatoes. A light clicked on in the dim recesses of my frontal lobes. It was them all along. The bastards! Seething, I went into full-blown Basil Fawlty mode, frogmarching them back to their run. As if my life wasn't complicated enough. Anyone who keeps hens knows each egg costs about as much as a dozen prime, organic, free-range eggs from a supermarket and that they demand constant attention. At bottom they are vile, malicious creatures. So Tom and I made screens to go across the greenhouse and tunnel doors, to keep hens out, and to let the ventilation and lovely, harmless slugs in.",

'People tend to associate the word Buffalo with Bob Marley's 'Buffalo Soldier',' Ray once explained, 'but in fact it's a Caribbean expression to describe people who are rude boys or rebels. Not necessarily tough, but hard style taken from the street... a functional and stylish look; non-fashion with a hard attitude.' </p> <p>Petri was born in Dundee and moved to Brisbane, Australia when his family emigrated there in his teens. By the mid-70s he was back in Britain, running a stall in north London's Camden Passage antiques market. Moving in creative circles among art students and photographers, he'd decided to become a photographer's agent, recruiting some raw talent in the form of Marc Lebon and Jamie Morgan. Still, he soon discovered he preferred a more hands-on approach to fashion photography: the casting and styling of images for which there was, at that time, only a very limited audience. 'It can be no surprise that Ray showed up at our door,' says Nick Logan, founder editor of The Face and Arena , 'Other than i-D , where else would he have gone?' </p> <p>In the early 80s, fashion photography was still largely the preserve of the glossies, but at The Face and i-D , Ray's vision coincided with the very beginning of what has subsequently become the commercialisation and mass consumption of street style. Petri played skilfully with the iconography and mythology of the heterosexual modern hero and the homo-erotic muse. He created new breeds of free-range urban cowboys in Ray-Ban aviators and hats; a suited and booted beauty accessorised by a feathered Native American headdress; a smiling black boxer with a blowsy red rose tucked behind his ear; boys in highly polished brogues worn with tracksuits; Crombie coats teamed with shorts; sportswear and couture; kilts and diamant\u00e9_ and the definitive Petri Buffalo garment, the no-nonsense Nylon MA1 army surplus flight jacket, lined in bright orange, teamed with Levi's 501s: the look that evolved into the predominant urban male uniform of the 80s. </p> <p>From expressing the style of a small gang of west London movers and shakers, Buffalo hit the big time when the heavily pregnant Neneh Cherry took her Buffalo stance from Notting Hill to the Top of the Pops studio and the charts. Funny, but just a few years before the Spices and All Saints bared their big-bellies-as-fashion-statements, the sight of an eight-month-pregnant Neneh gyrating, fecund-but-sexy, on TOTP was a small stylistic watershed - if not the first sign that the 80s were all but over and the in-touch-with-its-feminine-side 90s were on the way. Though necessarily identified with the 80s, Petri would have much preferred both the 90s and the zero-zeros, politically, emotionally, culturally, socially and visually - but then Ray was always ahead of his time. </p> <p>Petri was a fashion stylist long before this was a coveted job description and another amorphous by-product of the global fashion industry. Indeed, in the early 80s, selecting and arranging clothes on models was still known, if it was known at all, as 'fashion editing', but he was an instinctive stylist, using his visual flair and magpie intelligence to produce elegant, unfussy and invariably sensual images of timeless modernity. </p> <p>Petri didn't live long enough to get rich on the back of the fact that his visual influence has now been almost totally absorbed into fashion's mainstream, turned into a hugely successful, branded, marketable, logo-ised industry. Likewise, he never worked with many of the people in the business whom he has inspired directly - the gifted Austrian designer Helmut Lang, say, or, indirectly, the skilled marketeer Tommy Hilfiger, or David Beckham, or any of the tens of thousands of visually savvy teenagers and twentysomethings whose easy, confident mix of fashion and sportswear has been the predominant urban style over the past decade. But in high fashion circles, among names like Giorgio Armani and Jean Paul Gaultier (both of whom he knew well and collaborated with) to today's younger generation of career stylists on their fat, glossy-magazine salaries, advertising contracts and handsome retainers with the corporates, Petri's name commands awesome respect. </p> <p>Ray Petri was a genuinely charismatic figure. The sort of man who, even if you had your back to the door, one still sensed had made an entrance. Tall, smiling and handsome with slightly sad eyes and a gently penetrating gaze, I first met him in the early 80s as a young fashion writer at i-D . He instantly brought out my inner, slavering groupie, but was always sweet enough to pretend he hadn't noticed. Then, in 1987, I moved on to become The Face 's first fashion editor and, for a while, learning on the job, I sometimes felt I was working under false pretences. In fashion terms, there was probably nobody whose approval I sought more than Ray's, but whatever he really thought about my wobbly fashion vision, he was never less than a gent and always treated me as a creative equal. </p> <p>In 1988, I vividly remember Ray coming into the office for a meeting. Seeing his face bearing the unmistakeable stigmata of Kaposi's Sarcoma, I immediately fled the office in tears and angrily walked round the block, muttering 'not fair, not fair, not fair_' before pulling myself together and - mascara messily smeared - having the meeting. Ray didn't bat an eyelid, he was far too big - and too cool - for that. But he was no saint and was not without ego. Indeed, before his death, he had enough of a sense of his burgeoning influence and potential legacy to be editing pictures for a project that, 11 years down the line, has evolved into a beautiful book, Buffalo , edited, written and designed by the Buffalo boys and girls he considered to be as close, if not closer, than family. And as Life magazine's Buffalo reunion portrait reveals, they still are. Now there's a legacy to be proud of. </p> <p>\u0095 Readers can order a copy of Mitzi Lorenz's Buffalo (out 21 September) for \u00a326 (rrp \u00a330), plus 99p p&amp;p, by calling The Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171, or sending a cheque, payable to The Observer CultureShop, to Observer Buffalo Offer, 250 Western Avenue, London W3 6EE</p>",

Though necessarily identified with the 80s, Petri would have much preferred both the 90s and the zero-zeros, politically, emotionally, culturally, socially and visually - but then Ray was always ahead of his time. Petri was a fashion stylist long before this was a coveted job description and another amorphous by-product of the global fashion industry. Indeed, in the early 80s, selecting and arranging clothes on models was still known, if it was known at all, as 'fashion editing', but he was an instinctive stylist, using his visual flair and magpie intelligence to produce elegant, unfussy and invariably sensual images of timeless modernity. Petri didn't live long enough to get rich on the back of the fact that his visual influence has now been almost totally absorbed into fashion's mainstream, turned into a hugely successful, branded, marketable, logo-ised industry. Likewise, he never worked with many of the people in the business whom he has inspired directly - the gifted Austrian designer Helmut Lang, say, or, indirectly, the skilled marketeer Tommy Hilfiger, or David Beckham, or any of the tens of thousands of visually savvy teenagers and twentysomethings whose easy, confident mix of fashion and sportswear has been the predominant urban style over the past decade. But in high fashion circles, among names like Giorgio Armani and Jean Paul Gaultier (both of whom he knew well and collaborated with) to today's younger generation of career stylists on their fat, glossy-magazine salaries, advertising contracts and handsome retainers with the corporates, Petri's name commands awesome respect. Ray Petri was a genuinely charismatic figure. The sort of man who, even if you had your back to the door, one still sensed had made an entrance. Tall, smiling and handsome with slightly sad eyes and a gently penetrating gaze, I first met him in the early 80s as a young fashion writer at i-D . He instantly brought out my inner, slavering groupie, but was always sweet enough to pretend he hadn't noticed. Then, in 1987, I moved on to become The Face 's first fashion editor and, for a while, learning on the job, I sometimes felt I was working under false pretences. In fashion terms, there was probably nobody whose approval I sought more than Ray's, but whatever he really thought about my wobbly fashion vision, he was never less than a gent and always treated me as a creative equal. In 1988, I vividly remember Ray coming into the office for a meeting. Seeing his face bearing the unmistakeable stigmata of Kaposi's Sarcoma, I immediately fled the office in tears and angrily walked round the block, muttering 'not fair, not fair, not fair_' before pulling myself together and - mascara messily smeared - having the meeting. Ray didn't bat an eyelid, he was far too big - and too cool - for that. But he was no saint and was not without ego. Indeed, before his death, he had enough of a sense of his burgeoning influence and potential legacy to be editing pictures for a project that, 11 years down the line, has evolved into a beautiful book, Buffalo , edited, written and designed by the Buffalo boys and girls he considered to be as close, if not closer, than family. And as Life magazine's Buffalo reunion portrait reveals, they still are. Now there's a legacy to be proud of. \u0095 Readers can order a copy of Mitzi Lorenz's Buffalo (out 21 September) for \u00a326 (rrp \u00a330), plus 99p p&amp;p, by calling The Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171, or sending a cheque, payable to The Observer CultureShop, to Observer Buffalo Offer, 250 Western Avenue, London W3 6EE",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ever the gentleman, Sacha Distel pops out to receive us at the gate of his Paris town house: not so tall and not so young, but still tanned and fairly lovely - in a mini-series kind of way - in Lacoste and Levi's. As he leads the way indoors, through the hall and up the stairs, I have time to admire a brilliant proliferation of mirrors, a series of 19th-century English fox-hunting prints, and the fact that Monsieur Distel, to judge from the leather patch attached to the rear of his jeans, maintains a 32-inch waist. </p> <p>Honestly, it's freaky how little wear and tear he exhibits. The only concessions to the long years of touring are the crows' feet fanning out from the corners of his famous green eyes - one of which has a slight cast as a result of an 80s car crash - and the vaguest hint of badger at his temples. 'My first British agent always told me, \"Jus' give them the eyes and the teeth,\"' he remarks later, while he is having his photograph taken and, yes, you can see why the eyes and the teeth did the trick every time. </p> <p>Nowadays, Sacha Distel, the man most likely to stay 25 forever, is 67. He doesn't like to talk about his age, though. Even the word is avoided, slalomed around with elegant superstition. Instead, he talks about 'the number', as if it's just a code on a bus ticket or a dry-cleaning receipt: a random, largely irrelevant figure. 'I don't feel too concerned, except that you have a number,' he says, when asked if he worries about getting old. 'I go skiing every year, and till the next time, when the snows will come back, the time goes so quick. Then you think of the number and you say, \"Another 12 times, another 15 times, and the number will be...\" and then you get frightened. So that's a thought that I'm trying not to have.' </p> <p>His figure and expensive teak burnish are maintained by regular sessions on slopes and courts; his mostly blue-black hair is all his own - and, he is at pains to point out, not dyed. 'It's just luck,' he adds, in a voice as deep as a spy sub, as rich as St Emilion au Chocolat. 'My uncle Ventura was quite fat, bald and pale. And during my childhood, my friends who saw his jazz band would say, \"Oh, you'll be fat and bald like your uncle.\" And you should see them now.' He can't help adding that when he meets 'the lady friends' of his thirtysomething sons, 'I can still see it in their eyes. It gives me a good feeling, you know.' </p> <p>We are sitting on very low-slung scarlet and gold sofas at one end of a long sitting room, papered in yellow silk. In front of us is a silver table upon which are placed, at ritualistic intervals, silver hip flasks, cigarette cases, lighters: the decorative apparatus of hedonism. (Distel has never smoked, and has only been drunk once in his life, an experience he did not enjoy. 'I always loved, since I was a child, to have things under control.') The doors on to the terrace are open to sun and birdsong, and to the intermittent murmur of tourists making their way to the Le Corbusier edifice at the end of the street. Distel has lived in this tall, narrow house for nearly 40 years. He once joked that his wife Francine, a one-time member of the Olympic ski team, married him for it. You may associate him with the south of France - in many people's memories, he will forever be the man with whom, during one amazing summer, a barefoot Brigitte Bardot rode pillion along the C&amp;'244;te d'Azur - but Distel has always been based in Paris. For the next six months, however, he will be living in a pied-\u00e0-terre in London, making his stage debut in the musical Chicago . </p> <p>'I've never done anysing like this, you know?' he says, propping himself against the cushions. 'And I love England. I was so srilled to see that everybody is interested, everybody still knows me, you know?' The fact that his character, Billy Flynn, is a hard-boiled, fast-talking Chicagoan lawyer presents no worries either. 'I think it's the first time they have a real top-of-the-bill type of name. So they won't mind about the accent.' </p> <p>No, they probably won't. Distel, who recently enraged his compatriots when he said he preferred to sing in English than French because it is 'more beautiful', has always loved England, and England - well, bits of it, anyway - has always loved him back. In France, his jazz roots were forgotten when he became a successful singer in 1959, shortly after breaking up with Bardot. To his annoyance, when he composed 'The Good Life' - later recorded by everyone from Sarah Vaughan to Frank Sinatra - his record company put it out as a B-side. The French public, used to his 'happy, novelty' songs, now had him taped as 'happy-go-lucky, the brother, the cousin'.</p> <p> In the UK, despite notching up the biggest hit of his career with the perky 'Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head', he was seen in a different light. Perhaps it says more about the British nation than one Frenchman, but when Distel tolerantly played the fall guy to Morecambe and Wise (who nicknamed him Slasher) he became 'the heart-throb, the sex symbol, whatever you call it'. Always accompanied by violins, girls singing 'Aaah!' and softly parping horns, Distel became the sound of safe continental sophistication - too safe, too smooth to attract the lint of nostalgia, though, so he's largely missed out on the easy-listening revival. Even if you can't actually remember any of his hits, you're probably able to recall the line in that old Peter Sarstedt confection 'Where Do You Go To My Lovely', in which his name is dropped, alongside those of Balmain and Juan-les-Pins, to semaphore exotic jet-settery: </p> <p> You live in a fancy apartment <br> Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel </p> <p>Where you keep your Rolling Stones records </p> <p>And a friend of Sacha Distel </p> <p>Distel is fond of his fans, mere mortals who age while he stays, more or less, the same. He tells me about Theresa, the president of his British fan club ('if I still have a fan club') whom he first met when she was eight. At their first meeting, which took place outside the London Hippodrome, following an appearance on Cilla Black's show, she was accompanied by her parents. Now she must be 45. 'Theresa. That one is very nice. She never married.' There is a pause. He thinks for a moment, head tilted to one side. 'Sometimes that's the bad thing about it. Not Theresa, but people fix themselves and that changes their lives, sometimes. You know? I'm not sure that's good. You're in their mind all the time. I'm always happy to be friendly but as the years pass by - bom-bom-bom-bom, 20 years later, 30 years later - sometimes you feel a little bit sad.' </p> <p>I ask Distel when he first realised he had it. It . You know, sex appeal. He laughs a little, ha ha ha ha, just to be modest, and then answers matter-of-factly. 'I was 13. I was very shy, in a way, as a boy. And there was a girl that I liked. And she came to me.' He explains about the verb draguer , which my Anglo-French dictionary translates as 'to dredge; to fish with a dragnet; to chat up, to try and pick up'. 'Well, I never dragged. Je ne drague pas !' </p> <p>One thing that his fans really love about Sacha Distel is his heroic family history. Leo, his father, was a White Russian who made his way to Paris after the Revolution and doggedly built up an electrical business, desperate to prove his worth to the prosperous jeweller who reluctantly became his father-in-law. Sacha was an only child. After the German invasion, his mother Andr\u00e9e, who was both Jewish and a member of the Resistance, was taken away. 'Seven o'clock in the morning, bang bang, it's the police - out.' She was sent to a camp near Paris; Leo went into hiding; and Sacha, then aged nine, was sent to a boarding school in the provinces. 'We knew she was alive. My father knew a little bit what was happening, and he would let me know what I could understand. Psst, that now is a little vague.' Two years later, against the odds, the Distels were reunited, and went back to Paris. It must have been difficult, adjusting to being a family again. No. 'I think it was even better.' </p> <p>His mother's brother, the band leader Ray Ventura, introduced Distel to music. Distel describes going round to his maternal grandparents, who lived only a few streets away from where we are now, on Sunday afternoons, 'and my uncle was there, and his friends would come, they'd write songs, it was so exciting, so fun. And my father was selling electrical supplies.' Though he studied the piano, the guitar caught his eye early on, when he took a holiday job couriering Henri Salvador, the guitarist in Ventura's jazz band, to the studio. 'He was always singing love songs, and all the ladies. I was 14, 15!' Shortly after, Distel made his amateur jazz debut. </p> <p>After military service, his uncle offered him a job in his music-publishing firm, and for a while he twinned this with performing. But then, in 1958, came Bardot, who had just made And God Created Woman. Shortly after their eight-month relationship folded, Distel launched his own singing career. People assumed that he was a gigolo with an eye on the main chance, but by then he was already an established musician (voted Best Guitarist by two French jazz mags for seven years running). In any case, he'd always wanted to sing. </p> <p>In her recent autobiography, Bardot didn't exactly mince her words. 'All of a sudden the star of the couple was him with his contracts, his musicians, his think tank, his public relations,' she wrote of her ex-fianc\u00e9. 'If only he had known at the time that his first public-relations asset was me. He didn't find out until afterwards when he had become a zero.' </p> <p>Chivalrously, Distel shrugs this off. He hasn't read the book, apart from newspaper excerpts, 'and I'll tell you why. When I met Brigitte and had a short relationship, it was very honest, very beautiful, romantic. We never see each other, but now I just want to keep this souvenir of this beautiful woman, beautiful time. And what she's become since, how she thinks now, what she looks like now, I'm not interested. What she says of what was - not concerning me but concerning people I know - is not true. So I can say that probably some of the things she says about me, and I've heard they're not really too bad, should not be [taken too seriously]. I don't want to know! It was great, I was with the most beautiful girl in the world, and that's it.' </p> <p>They last had contact in 1970, when Leo died. 'She wrote a very nice letter. She knew my father and it was beautiful, really. My thoughts about her are very nice, but I'm just happy I married the right girl after all.' </p> <p>At the moment, Francine, whom he met while skiing at Meg\u00e8ve, is at their house in the south of France. (Her mother died there the day before yesterday, a few hours after Distel had left for Paris. 'She said her mother went to swim in the pool. She went in the deep end. Down the stairs, into the water, she was swimming, and then she went: \"Oh!\" Finished. Ninety years old. Great, uh?') The marriage has been through its tricky patches - there was a nasty moment in 1985 when Distel wrapped his Porsche around a pylon in the middle of the night, damaging his eye and causing serious injuries to a soap starlet named Chantal who was in the passenger seat - but they appear to have weathered that successfully. 'Thirty-eight years in January,' muses Distel. 'I told her at the beginning, \"I'm going to marry you because you're going to be a nice little old lady.\" She hasn't turned into one yet.' </p> <p>While Distel has his photo taken upstairs, against the virulent Bridget Riley of his bedroom wallpaper, I wander into his den and admire a framed front cover of a 1963 Paris Match : 'Sacha Distel A Capitul\u00e9!'

The den, where Distel continues to compose, is packed with memorabilia as well as clues to his current eclectic tastes (the CD collection includes Lionel Ritchie, Britney Spears and Snoop Doggy Dogg) and to his slender figure (Effidigest tablets: 'digestive stimulant and flat abdomen'). Large clip frames full of black and white photographs hang on the walls: Distel, with boater and cane, doing a tap routine with Maurice Chevalier.

The light is gleaming off the satin stripe on his dress trousers and Bardot's incisors, bared in a huge, hungry smile as she looks towards the camera. Distel is rapt in profile, gazing at her. No eyes, no teeth this time: he looks like a man goggling at a natural phenomenon. It must have been strange for him to get to the edge of the volcano, this white-hot celebrity, and then back off into the comparative chill of the world outside of the A-list. But Distel is philosophical. 'I thank God. What a pleasant life, you know? I'm not the richest man in the world, but I'm OK. If I want to change my car, I change my car. I don't have to count out the pennies. What else? Got such a great house here and a chalet on a mountain. It's enough, you know?'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ever the gentleman, Sacha Distel pops out to receive us at the gate of his Paris town house: not so tall and not so young, but still tanned and fairly lovely - in a mini-series kind of way - in Lacoste and Levi's. As he leads the way indoors, through the hall and up the stairs, I have time to admire a brilliant proliferation of mirrors, a series of 19th-century English fox-hunting prints, and the fact that Monsieur Distel, to judge from the leather patch attached to the rear of his jeans, maintains a 32-inch waist. Honestly, it's freaky how little wear and tear he exhibits. The only concessions to the long years of touring are the crows' feet fanning out from the corners of his famous green eyes - one of which has a slight cast as a result of an 80s car crash - and the vaguest hint of badger at his temples. 'My first British agent always told me, \"Jus' give them the eyes and the teeth,\"' he remarks later, while he is having his photograph taken and, yes, you can see why the eyes and the teeth did the trick every time. Nowadays, Sacha Distel, the man most likely to stay 25 forever, is 67. He doesn't like to talk about his age, though. Even the word is avoided, slalomed around with elegant superstition. Instead, he talks about 'the number', as if it's just a code on a bus ticket or a dry-cleaning receipt: a random, largely irrelevant figure. 'I don't feel too concerned, except that you have a number,' he says, when asked if he worries about getting old. 'I go skiing every year, and till the next time, when the snows will come back, the time goes so quick. Then you think of the number and you say, \"Another 12 times, another 15 times, and the number will be...\" and then you get frightened. So that's a thought that I'm trying not to have.' His figure and expensive teak burnish are maintained by regular sessions on slopes and courts; his mostly blue-black hair is all his own - and, he is at pains to point out, not dyed. 'It's just luck,' he adds, in a voice as deep as a spy sub, as rich as St Emilion au Chocolat. 'My uncle Ventura was quite fat, bald and pale. And during my childhood, my friends who saw his jazz band would say, \"Oh, you'll be fat and bald like your uncle.\" And you should see them now.' He can't help adding that when he meets 'the lady friends' of his thirtysomething sons, 'I can still see it in their eyes. It gives me a good feeling, you know.' We are sitting on very low-slung scarlet and gold sofas at one end of a long sitting room, papered in yellow silk. In front of us is a silver table upon which are placed, at ritualistic intervals, silver hip flasks, cigarette cases, lighters: the decorative apparatus of hedonism. (Distel has never smoked, and has only been drunk once in his life, an experience he did not enjoy. 'I always loved, since I was a child, to have things under control.') The doors on to the terrace are open to sun and birdsong, and to the intermittent murmur of tourists making their way to the Le Corbusier edifice at the end of the street. Distel has lived in this tall, narrow house for nearly 40 years. He once joked that his wife Francine, a one-time member of the Olympic ski team, married him for it. You may associate him with the south of France - in many people's memories, he will forever be the man with whom, during one amazing summer, a barefoot Brigitte Bardot rode pillion along the C&amp;'244;te d'Azur - but Distel has always been based in Paris. For the next six months, however, he will be living in a pied-\u00e0-terre in London, making his stage debut in the musical Chicago . 'I've never done anysing like this, you know?' he says, propping himself against the cushions. 'And I love England. I was so srilled to see that everybody is interested, everybody still knows me, you know?' The fact that his character, Billy Flynn, is a hard-boiled, fast-talking Chicagoan lawyer presents no worries either. 'I think it's the first time they have a real top-of-the-bill type of name. So they won't mind about the accent.' No, they probably won't. Distel, who recently enraged his compatriots when he said he preferred to sing in English than French because it is 'more beautiful', has always loved England, and England - well, bits of it, anyway - has always loved him back. In France, his jazz roots were forgotten when he became a successful singer in 1959, shortly after breaking up with Bardot. To his annoyance, when he composed 'The Good Life' - later recorded by everyone from Sarah Vaughan to Frank Sinatra - his record company put it out as a B-side. The French public, used to his 'happy, novelty' songs, now had him taped as 'happy-go-lucky, the brother, the cousin'. In the UK, despite notching up the biggest hit of his career with the perky 'Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head', he was seen in a different light. Perhaps it says more about the British nation than one Frenchman, but when Distel tolerantly played the fall guy to Morecambe and Wise (who nicknamed him Slasher) he became 'the heart-throb, the sex symbol, whatever you call it'. Always accompanied by violins, girls singing 'Aaah!' and softly parping horns, Distel became the sound of safe continental sophistication - too safe, too smooth to attract the lint of nostalgia, though, so he's largely missed out on the easy-listening revival. Even if you can't actually remember any of his hits, you're probably able to recall the line in that old Peter Sarstedt confection 'Where Do You Go To My Lovely', in which his name is dropped, alongside those of Balmain and Juan-les-Pins, to semaphore exotic jet-settery: You live in a fancy apartment Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel Where you keep your Rolling Stones records And a friend of Sacha Distel Distel is fond of his fans, mere mortals who age while he stays, more or less, the same. He tells me about Theresa, the president of his British fan club ('if I still have a fan club') whom he first met when she was eight. At their first meeting, which took place outside the London Hippodrome, following an appearance on Cilla Black's show, she was accompanied by her parents. Now she must be 45. 'Theresa. That one is very nice. She never married.' There is a pause. He thinks for a moment, head tilted to one side. 'Sometimes that's the bad thing about it. Not Theresa, but people fix themselves and that changes their lives, sometimes. You know? I'm not sure that's good. You're in their mind all the time. I'm always happy to be friendly but as the years pass by - bom-bom-bom-bom, 20 years later, 30 years later - sometimes you feel a little bit sad.' I ask Distel when he first realised he had it. It . You know, sex appeal. He laughs a little, ha ha ha ha, just to be modest, and then answers matter-of-factly. 'I was 13. I was very shy, in a way, as a boy. And there was a girl that I liked. And she came to me.' He explains about the verb draguer , which my Anglo-French dictionary translates as 'to dredge; to fish with a dragnet; to chat up, to try and pick up'. 'Well, I never dragged. Je ne drague pas !' One thing that his fans really love about Sacha Distel is his heroic family history. Leo, his father, was a White Russian who made his way to Paris after the Revolution and doggedly built up an electrical business, desperate to prove his worth to the prosperous jeweller who reluctantly became his father-in-law. Sacha was an only child. After the German invasion, his mother Andr\u00e9e, who was both Jewish and a member of the Resistance, was taken away. 'Seven o'clock in the morning, bang bang, it's the police - out.' She was sent to a camp near Paris; Leo went into hiding; and Sacha, then aged nine, was sent to a boarding school in the provinces. 'We knew she was alive. My father knew a little bit what was happening, and he would let me know what I could understand. Psst, that now is a little vague.' Two years later, against the odds, the Distels were reunited, and went back to Paris. It must have been difficult, adjusting to being a family again. No. 'I think it was even better.' His mother's brother, the band leader Ray Ventura, introduced Distel to music. Distel describes going round to his maternal grandparents, who lived only a few streets away from where we are now, on Sunday afternoons, 'and my uncle was there, and his friends would come, they'd write songs, it was so exciting, so fun. And my father was selling electrical supplies.' Though he studied the piano, the guitar caught his eye early on, when he took a holiday job couriering Henri Salvador, the guitarist in Ventura's jazz band, to the studio. 'He was always singing love songs, and all the ladies. I was 14, 15!' Shortly after, Distel made his amateur jazz debut. After military service, his uncle offered him a job in his music-publishing firm, and for a while he twinned this with performing. But then, in 1958, came Bardot, who had just made And God Created Woman. Shortly after their eight-month relationship folded, Distel launched his own singing career. People assumed that he was a gigolo with an eye on the main chance, but by then he was already an established musician (voted Best Guitarist by two French jazz mags for seven years running). In any case, he'd always wanted to sing. In her recent autobiography, Bardot didn't exactly mince her words. 'All of a sudden the star of the couple was him with his contracts, his musicians, his think tank, his public relations,' she wrote of her ex-fianc\u00e9. 'If only he had known at the time that his first public-relations asset was me. He didn't find out until afterwards when he had become a zero.' Chivalrously, Distel shrugs this off. He hasn't read the book, apart from newspaper excerpts, 'and I'll tell you why. When I met Brigitte and had a short relationship, it was very honest, very beautiful, romantic. We never see each other, but now I just want to keep this souvenir of this beautiful woman, beautiful time. And what she's become since, how she thinks now, what she looks like now, I'm not interested. What she says of what was - not concerning me but concerning people I know - is not true. So I can say that probably some of the things she says about me, and I've heard they're not really too bad, should not be [taken too seriously]. I don't want to know! It was great, I was with the most beautiful girl in the world, and that's it.' They last had contact in 1970, when Leo died. 'She wrote a very nice letter. She knew my father and it was beautiful, really. My thoughts about her are very nice, but I'm just happy I married the right girl after all.' At the moment, Francine, whom he met while skiing at Meg\u00e8ve, is at their house in the south of France. (Her mother died there the day before yesterday, a few hours after Distel had left for Paris. 'She said her mother went to swim in the pool. She went in the deep end. Down the stairs, into the water, she was swimming, and then she went: \"Oh!\" Finished. Ninety years old. Great, uh?') The marriage has been through its tricky patches - there was a nasty moment in 1985 when Distel wrapped his Porsche around a pylon in the middle of the night, damaging his eye and causing serious injuries to a soap starlet named Chantal who was in the passenger seat - but they appear to have weathered that successfully. 'Thirty-eight years in January,' muses Distel. 'I told her at the beginning, \"I'm going to marry you because you're going to be a nice little old lady.\" She hasn't turned into one yet.' While Distel has his photo taken upstairs, against the virulent Bridget Riley of his bedroom wallpaper, I wander into his den and admire a framed front cover of a 1963 Paris Match : 'Sacha Distel A Capitul\u00e9!' Sacha and Francine, their dark, healthy good looks thrown into definition by shaggy white fur collars, press their heads close for the camera's benefit.

      "body": "<p>As a schoolgirl, Kathie Gadd used to amuse and amaze her friends by twisting her body into spectacular positions. While classmates struggled to perform simple manoeuvres in gym lessons, she could bend over backwards like a crab, place her hands flat on the floor or bend back and stick her head between her knees with ease.</p> <p>'It was a bit of a party trick,' she says.</p> <p>'I showed off, because I could do these things that no one else could.'</p> <p>Teachers called her double-jointed, while friends nicknamed her 'rubber legs'. But for Kathie, as for many other people who can contort their bodies into exotic positions, the gift has a sting in the tail.</p> <p>Now 38 and the mother of three children aged six, eight and 14, Kathie can walk usually only with the aid of crutches, has been forced to give up work and can no longer enjoy gardening because her knees give way when she bends them. The flexibility in her joints, once the source of such pride, now causes frequent injuries and constant pain. Her condition is called hypermobility syndrome but although it was first recognised more than 30 years ago, it remains largely a mystery and is frequently overlooked or dismissed by doctors.</p> <p>Professor Rodney Grahame - a rheumatologist who specialises in treating the condition - believes, however, that the syndrome may be far more common than we realise. 'It could be a prime cause of pain in the community,' says Grahame, who runs one of only three hypermobility clinics in the UK, at University College Hospital in London.</p> <p>He estimates that as many as one in 10 people are hypermobile, which means they are able to bend some or all of their joints more than is normal. The cause is a genetic disorder which makes collagen, the main ingredient in ligaments and other tissues, more stretchy. Hypermobile people are extremely agile as children and some actually grow up to become gymnasts, musicians, ballet dancers and even circus performers or professional contortionists.</p> <p>For most people, hypermobility causes no problems and needs no treatment. For a tiny minority, however, hypermobility can be part of several more serious problems, such as Marfan syndrome, where the heart, eyes and blood vessels are affected, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, where major blood vessels can be damaged. For a substantial number of those who are adversely affected, though, joint flexibility is the cause of life-long pain and injury, and is known as hypermobility syndrome.</p> <p>As children, sufferers often walk late and complain of 'growing pains'. Serious problems do not appear until the teens when they succumb to repeated injuries. Other problems include stretchy skin, which bruises and tears easily, osteo-arthritis and hernias. Yet often sufferers spend years trying to persuade their doctors that something is wrong and are dismissed as hypochondriacs.</p> <p>'It tends to be trivialised, even by the medical profession,' Grahame says. 'The view is that these are \"weird\" people, they stretch in odd ways, so they haven't been taken seriously.' With no laboratory test or outward signs to detect the syndrome, sufferers are frequently told they are imagining their problems. Even among experts there is scepticism. A recent survey showed that half of rheumatologists did not believe the condition had a significant impact on patients' lives, while a few did not even accept its existence.</p> <p>By the time patients reach Professor Grahame's clinic, many have spent years battling unsympathetic GPs and being sent for repeated tests in vain. Often the combined effect of such frustration and chronic pain leads to depression. 'There will be patients at their wits' end, quite desperate because they have been from pillar to post without their condition being recognised.'</p> <p>Yet the pattern of symptoms is clear - even down to the fact that many sufferers do not respond to local anaesthetic injections - and Grahame argues that there can be no doubt the syndrome exists. He confirms diagnosis with tests on the joints and outlines ways to manage the condition. There is no cure, and many sufferers respond poorly to conventional treatment, like pain-relieving drugs, while surgery can make matters worse. Usually physiotherapy offers the best chance of relief, while pain management clinics can help people cope.</p> <p>Typically, Kathie's problems began when she was 16 and her left foot suddenly swelled to the size of a small football. Tests and X-rays showed nothing and doctors eventually concluded that her joints were unstable but offered no treatment plan.</p> <p>'I didn't realise the extent of it at the time. I didn't realise it was something that affected all my joints,' says Kathie, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, and now chairs the Hypermobility Syndrome Association (HMSA), which supports sufferers and their families.</p> <p>For the next 20 years, she persevered without medical help, causing further damage to her foot and - as she walked unevenly - her spine. Finally, three years ago, an orthopaedic surgeon told her she needed major surgery to reconstruct her foot while further examinations revealed problems throughout her body, including arthritis in her spine and dislocating kneecaps. But the first of three operations went badly wrong when Kathie developed blood clots which came close to killing her. She declined further operations and now has to use crutches to get around.</p> <p>Her teenage daughter helps out by cooking and ironing, but Kathie can no longer enjoy long country walks or play football with her two boys. She has to exercise for 45 minutes every day to strengthen her muscles and uses techniques like self-hypnosis to manage the pain. 'It is mainly running around, and the stupid things you do with the kids, that I miss,' she says.</p> <p>At the chronic pain-management clinic in St Thomas's Hospital, London, staff specialise in helping people with hypermobility syndrome to live with their pain. Nearly half of the clinic's patients have the syndrome. Staff use cognitive behavioural therapy to help sufferers alter their lifestyles and moods in order to reduce factors which cause pain. They also suggest exercises to strengthen muscles and teach pain-management techniques. Physiotherapist Vicki Harding says that when they start the programme, patients generally rate their pain at about 75 on a scale of 100 and gauge the distress this causes at about the same figure. When they leave, many rate their pain as worse but most say the distress it causes is down to 25.</p> <p>Still, many sufferers continue to live a nightmare of pain and confusion as doctors continue to miss the condition. Vicki Rogers realised only two years ago that her daughter Charlotte, 13, had hypermobility syndrome after doctors drew a blank in attempting to explain her recurrent injuries.</p> <p>Charlotte had always been extremely agile, performing 'disgusting' tricks like putting her legs behind her head. But the family also thought her clumsy because she so frequently hurt herself. 'We had a season ticket to A &amp; E,' says Vicki, who grew quite anxious that staff might think Charlotte was the victim of child abuse - a charge that other parents with hypermobile children often meet.</p> <p>Two years ago, Charlotte developed a pain in her groin and by the end of the next day one leg was so stiff she could not walk. She spent two weeks in hospital undergoing tests until doctors admitted they could find no explanation and discharged her. 'We took her into hospital with a sore groin and brought her home in a wheelchair,' says Vicki. The family were mystified until a friend suggested hypermobility syndrome and Vicki obtained a leaflet describing the condition.</p> <p>'It was wonderful,' she says. 'I read it and everything fitted into place.' The family rented a villa with a swimming pool in Italy for three weeks where they cajoled and bribed Charlotte into swimming every day until finally she could move her leg normally again. Now Charlotte takes part in school sports and rides her horse just as before, but whenever she injures herself - which is often - she uses exercises designed by a physiotherapist to restore mobility.</p> <p>'She injures very easily,' says Vicki. 'She can fall off her horse and not damage anything then walk out of a room, put her hand on the door and sprain her wrist.' Now she hopes the condition has been detected early enough to limit future problems but says: 'I desperately wish we had realised what it was when she was younger.' *</p> <p><b> Flexible problems</b></p> <p>Up to one in 10 of the population may be hypermobile, meaning that their joints are excessively supple. It is more common in women and some ethnic groups.

Finally, three years ago, an orthopaedic surgeon told her she needed major surgery to reconstruct her foot while further examinations revealed problems throughout her body, including arthritis in her spine and dislocating kneecaps. But the first of three operations went badly wrong when Kathie developed blood clots which came close to killing her. She declined further operations and now has to use crutches to get around. Her teenage daughter helps out by cooking and ironing, but Kathie can no longer enjoy long country walks or play football with her two boys. She has to exercise for 45 minutes every day to strengthen her muscles and uses techniques like self-hypnosis to manage the pain. 'It is mainly running around, and the stupid things you do with the kids, that I miss,' she says. At the chronic pain-management clinic in St Thomas's Hospital, London, staff specialise in helping people with hypermobility syndrome to live with their pain. Nearly half of the clinic's patients have the syndrome. Staff use cognitive behavioural therapy to help sufferers alter their lifestyles and moods in order to reduce factors which cause pain. They also suggest exercises to strengthen muscles and teach pain-management techniques. Physiotherapist Vicki Harding says that when they start the programme, patients generally rate their pain at about 75 on a scale of 100 and gauge the distress this causes at about the same figure. When they leave, many rate their pain as worse but most say the distress it causes is down to 25. Still, many sufferers continue to live a nightmare of pain and confusion as doctors continue to miss the condition. Vicki Rogers realised only two years ago that her daughter Charlotte, 13, had hypermobility syndrome after doctors drew a blank in attempting to explain her recurrent injuries. Charlotte had always been extremely agile, performing 'disgusting' tricks like putting her legs behind her head. But the family also thought her clumsy because she so frequently hurt herself. 'We had a season ticket to A &amp; E,' says Vicki, who grew quite anxious that staff might think Charlotte was the victim of child abuse - a charge that other parents with hypermobile children often meet. Two years ago, Charlotte developed a pain in her groin and by the end of the next day one leg was so stiff she could not walk. She spent two weeks in hospital undergoing tests until doctors admitted they could find no explanation and discharged her. 'We took her into hospital with a sore groin and brought her home in a wheelchair,' says Vicki. The family were mystified until a friend suggested hypermobility syndrome and Vicki obtained a leaflet describing the condition. 'It was wonderful,' she says. 'I read it and everything fitted into place.' The family rented a villa with a swimming pool in Italy for three weeks where they cajoled and bribed Charlotte into swimming every day until finally she could move her leg normally again. Now Charlotte takes part in school sports and rides her horse just as before, but whenever she injures herself - which is often - she uses exercises designed by a physiotherapist to restore mobility. 'She injures very easily,' says Vicki. 'She can fall off her horse and not damage anything then walk out of a room, put her hand on the door and sprain her wrist.' Now she hopes the condition has been detected early enough to limit future problems but says: 'I desperately wish we had realised what it was when she was younger.' * Flexible problems Up to one in 10 of the population may be hypermobile, meaning that their joints are excessively supple. It is more common in women and some ethnic groups. Five simple tests can detect hypermobility. \u0095 Placing your hands flat on the floor with knees straight \u0095 Bending your elbow backwards \u0095 Bending your knee backwards \u0095 Bending your thumb back to touch the front of your forearm \u0095 Bending your little finger back at right angles Score one point for the first test and one for every other test on both sides of the body up to a maximum of nine. Most people score below two. Four or more may indicate hypermobility. \u0095: For information, contact the Hypermobility Syndrome Association, 71 Green Lane, Copnor, Portsmouth, Hants PO3 5EZ; www.hypermobility.org.

      "body": "<p>It isn't possible yet to say how the new invented tradition of laying soft toys and flowers at the scene of an accident or other bloody event started, although the roots probably lie in the street shrines of South America and India. What is clear is that it was an artist, the American Mike Kelley, who was talking about dolls 'accenting the pathetic's darker side' and using stuffed animals in his work in the 80s, a decade or so before shopping-centre and suburban street-corner shrines became a familiar part of the emotional and media landscape in this country.</p> <p>Kelley rescued chewed and smelly teddy bears and bunny rabbits from jumble sales and thrift stores and arranged them, clumped or individually, on dirty blankets on polished gallery floors. Although still virtually unknown here, Kelley has been a major influence on two generations of British artists who have used abject and degraded materials as a matter of course in their work. 'There are often unacknowledged but painfully obvious things going on around us,' Liam Gillick, who came through Goldsmiths with Sarah Lucas and Damien Hirst, once said. 'Kelley, and others such as Raymond Pettibon, Jim Shaw and Sue Williams have reinvigorated the debates around where we all stand in relation to shitting, dying, feeling paranoid and not really caring.'</p> <p>But for many years, Kelley had a hard time of it in America. He has made 'dolls' out of faeces. Nostalgic Depiction of the Innocence of Childhood shows a naked man and woman squatting on the floor astride soft toys. The man's buttocks are smeared with a dark chocolatey substance and he appears to be rubbing a fluffy rabbit up against himself. 'His body of work is often taken as a demonstration that art not only doesn't have to be appealing,' one critic has written, 'but that anything appealing in it is by definition not art.' Kelley's 'transgressive' representations of American life still tend to be viewed there as just another embodiment of its ugliness.</p> <p>I thought about Mike Kelley and his failure to return my calls (he is a notoriously reluctant interviewee) on the way to see Luc Tuymans in Belgium. Like Kelley, Tuymans is drawn to the banal and the dejected and to bilious, highly uncomfortable representations of childhood. Unusually (almost uniquely) for a sought-after young artist, Tuymans is a painter. His paintings typically have titles such as Repulsion , Embitterment , Incest , Resentment , Child Abuse , The Murderer . On a material level they are pitiable objects, thin and slapdash, the pictorial equivalent of Kelley's rag-doll installations. 'A lot of my imagery has a sense of coziness which is turned into something terrifying. Anything banal can be transformed into horror,' Tuymans has said. 'Violence is the only structure underlying my work.'</p> <p>Kelley and Tuymans are two of the dozen or so artists in Apocalypse, intended to be the autumn blockbuster show at the Royal Academy, designed to have them chewing the carpets in Great Missenden and Orpington. Subtitled Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art, Apocalypse is meant to be a kind of son-of-Sensation. In the show's catalogue, the co-curator Norman Rosenthal quotes Nietzsche on the importance of facing up to difficult knowledge, 'although it may be ugly and even deadly': 'Artists_ are best positioned to affect our knowledge by confronting us with a synthesis of new and often shocking realities_ The ability to look, make and map where no one has looked before is the aim of every artist and exhibition.'</p> <p>Already, though, a month before Apocalypse opened, David Lee, reliable no-goer and nay-sayer, had delivered his verdict to the London Evening Standard : 'Disgusting works with profane titles, profane works with disgusting titles, disgusting works with disgusting titles by disgusting artists'. Rosenthal is pissing in the wind.</p> <p>The day I travelled to Antwerp to meet Luc Tuymans was the day after the funeral of the murdered eight-year-old, Sarah Payne, and the newspapers all carried front-page stories and pictures. The Eurostar was full of the kind of photographs that had dominated the papers all summer: photographs of Sarah Payne's parents, her brothers and sister; photographs of floral tributes and Beanie Babies and weeping neighbours; photographs of the small white coffin in its Victorian hearse.</p> <p>The papers had also been full of other, angrier pictures all summer, in the wake of the News of the World 's 'name and shame' anti-paedophile campaign. Pictures of smashed windows and daubed houses and 'vigilante' marchers with children in prams and banners saying, 'People don't want no paedophiles here', 'No paedophile scum on this estate'.</p> <p>'Memes' is Richard Dawkins' word for those ideas that now and again surge through the culture, that proliferate and, sometimes, develop seemingly without specific ownership or particularity. When I had finished reading about Sarah Payne's funeral, I turned to the book of Luc Tuymans paintings that I had brought with me, and the commentary to the paintings that Tuymans had attached. Body , one of his best-known images, shows the headless and legless torso of a school-age girl. It is ghostly with a dull, cracked surface, and bled of all colour. 'It is the torso of a doll, with a zip fastener in the middle so you can open it up to put in stuffing and give it volume, a meaning,' Tuymans says of this small work. 'You can hardly see that the body looks as though it is injured, suffering the effects of cruelty. The zip fastener acts like a wound, like a cut.'</p> <p>Body is the painting of a child that is in fact a doll. Silence depicts a doll that turns out to be a child. It is equally anaemic, equally mute. 'Beneath its closed eyes, two colours appear, green and orange, which, taken together, form a superimposition. They indicate that the face is maimed from within, that it is ill,' Tuymans explains. 'It is as though the child has been infected by a virus which has spread through its whole body. The painting corresponds to complete silence.'</p> <p>There are others: Silent Music , which is an airless nursery room, stuffed with sinister furniture; Smell , based on the deodorant blocks you find in toilets; Incest , the abstraction of a hand sticking through something. The surface of Gas Chamber , on the other hand, which you would expect to be blackly sombre, is suffused with a honeyed orange glow. 'The picture radiates both fear and human warmth. That's actually its meaning. To approach the really terrible thing that cannot be depicted.'</p> <p>'Phantom figuration' and 'ghost painting' are some of the things Tuymans' style has been called. His pictures are universally bleak, gloomy even; indifferent; petrified. They seem shockingly casual - casually daubed with a scratchy brush while his mind was absent, thinking of something else. Tuymans' paintings are like half-thoughts; they are notoriously elusive (but they stay around - they are haunting; they haunt you): they have been likened to overexposed photographs or barely legible images on shrouds.</p> <p>We departed Lille and I flipped to the front of the book, where there was an interview with Tuymans. Q: 'Some of your paintings focus on the representation of childhood. Some details induce the viewer to think about childhood as fraught with horror, with unease, open to torment, abuse, ailment.' A: 'The idea of fear is pretty much embedded in my personality. Constant fear and constant uneasiness_ Fear of the dark, of physical mutilation, which were instilled very early on in me.' In answer to another question: 'For me, it's impossible to make a joyful painting.'</p> <p>His studio is in a working-class district of Antwerp, mainly occupied by Moroccans. Now aged 42, Tuymans has had the place - 'I regard it as a kind of protective shell' - for more than half his life. He doesn't live there any more, but it's pretty obvious that the cheerless atmosphere and air of near-dereliction sustain something that he needs for his painting, much as Francis Bacon liked to throw on dust, dirt, candle wax. (Norman Rosenthal says he found Tuymans' studio strongly reminiscent of Bacon's reeking, rubbish-strewn London studio in South Kensington.) Tuymans works on to unstretched canvas, nailed to the wall - paintings of King Leopold and other emblems of the Belgian imperium in the Congo; pictures that were uncharacteristic of Tuymans in their generosity of scale and use of colour and even allusions to a narrative element. Also some smaller works, painted on to newspaper, for an upcoming show in Japan.</p> <p>Most of his pictures depict rooms. Some of the rooms are evidently, or by implication, the scene of a crime. Bloodstains and Child Abuse are self-explanatory. Apple is the image of a decaying apple, taken from a police archive photograph of a murder scene. Tuymans works in a very small room with a big mirror. It can feel as if there's something a bit Rillington Place about it, a bit imminent and loaded - forensic, evidentiary - when you come to it fresh from the work.</p> <p>Plus, Tuymans isn't exactly overburdened with social skills. He seemed offhand and quite prepared to be disliked - always a good sign. He chain-smokes. He's arrogant. A mountain of dog-ends was spilling out of a deep bowl on to the floor. For an ashtray, he used the kind of small round mirror you expect to find in a budgie's cage; it sat on the arm of an armchair with its stuffing poking out looking, with the light swimming in it, like the kind of indeterminate, shifting image he likes to make in paint. A scab that turns out to be an embroidered flower. A skull that turns out to be the X-ray of a diseased tooth. An obscene gash that turns out to be the shadow thrown by a small girl's knee.</p> <p>Tuymans says he likes an image to stale. He picks it and then lets it hang around long enough to go dead on him, before he tries to embalm it in paint. No painting takes longer than a day, an unbreakable rule. There are preparatory drawings and watercolour sketches and then - indifferently, eventually - the small, malignly resonating, creepily beautiful, real thing. Occasionally the thing Tuymans finds on the wall staring back at him has the power to unnerve even him. This happened with Child Abuse . 'The colours are exagerrated, ugly. They glow dimly... I painted the picture quite unconsciously, and even I was shocked by the result... The idea of subversion, a perversity, becomes apparent in it.'</p> <p>Tuymans' work, like much of the work on show over the next three months at the Royal Academy, represents a kind of anti-sublime - what the artist Jake Chapman has called, only half-jokingly, a 'degenerate sublime'. It takes art about as far from the pleasure principle as it can be taken. In Tuymans' case, this is conscious. His work, he will patiently explain, sets out to reveal the cruelty and harshness of things. He despises a painter like Kandinsky for whom painting aspired to the condition of music. There's no place in Tuymans' life for music. He never listens to the radio. He told me he has never bought a record. 'Never. Not one. I have no urge to buy - what do you call them - CDs. I'm not so much interested in the spiritual aspect of culture - \"beauty\" or poetic descriptions of beauty don't seem real enough for me. Reality is actually far more important than any form of spirituality. Realism. It's much more interesting to crawl from underneath to the so-called top.'</p> <p>It is all a long way from Matisse, who spoke of his art of 'serenity, balance and repose' as providing restoration 'like a good armchair'. But maybe this is inevitable. Good art sucks in the psyche of its time, and our time isn't about beauty and order and the imitation of nature. Disorder, fear, Bacon's 'smell of death' were the central 20th-century experiences.</p> <p>Antwerp, where Tuymans lives, and Monchen gladbach on the German-Dutch border, where Gregor Schneider, another Apocalypse contributor, has a house, are both about 70km from Charlerois, in southern Belgium. Charlerois is where Marc Dutroux lived. Dutroux, who still hasn't come to trial, is accused of the abduction of six young girls, and the murder of four of them. Two of the children, just eight years old, were kept locked in a small cell in Dutroux's basement, where eventually they starved to death while their captor was in prison for four months. After the police arrested Dutroux, they discovered two other abducted girls, aged 12 and 14, still alive in the home-made dungeon. 'They were held in a white-painted concrete \"cave\" measuring 2m by 3m,' Time reported. 'The cell was cleverly concealed by sliding doors behind a basement cabinet.'</p> <p>There is an uncanny correspondence between this description of Dutroux's terrifying 'dungeon' and the dark, dank room that Gregor Schneider will be installing at the Royal Academy. It is the cellar of his own plain house in Rheydt, a suburb of Monchengladbach, hacked out stone by stone and removed bodily to London.</p> <p>The atmosphere of ominousness and dread that the two spaces have in common may be coincidental, but it isn't accidental. Although he is still only 31, Schneider has an interest in murder and what he calls 'places charged with a strong past event, but from which the event itself is absent' which dates back many years. His work, according to Rosenthal, 'exists in a space between the normal and the pathological'. The 'guest room' of Schneider's house in Rheydt has no windows and is clad with sheets of sound-proofing and lead covering. (Luc Tuymans has coincidentally done a set of paintings called Sealed Rooms . Mike Kelley has incorporated crawl spaces into several works.) Elsewhere in the house, walls have been built in front of walls, ceilings under ceilings, windows in front of windows. The 'coffee room' rotates 360 imperceptibly on its own axis: leaving by the door they arrived through, visitors risk stepping into a void. The house is riddled with the crawl spaces and deep shafts that Schneider has been excavating and modifying and concealing since he was 16.</p> <p>As a schoolboy, he obsessively photographed a place in the woods where a female art student had been murdered. He has been interested to discover 'whether a scream would stay behind in a room after you had left it'. Under the floor, there is a birdcage, dead animals, inflatable dolls. 'I'd love to stop someone getting away one time,' Schneider has said, 'but I have never dared to yet. I'm one of those people who live double lives and go out into the park at night and sift through the litter bins and secretly take something home with me_ I assume that there are others working at it and I will probably never meet the best ones.'</p> <p>The interesting thing is that both Tuymans and Schneider had been set on their paths for many years before the national trauma of Dutroux. For his last show in New York, it was naturally assumed that Tuymans was alluding to the paedophile scandal that had wracked his country, and to the occasion of the White March in Brussels, when 300,000 took to the streets to protest against the official incompetence and corruption that had made the system rotten. It was natural to assume it, but it wasn't necessarily the case.</p> <p>'Until that point,' Tuymans says, 'everyone looked at Belgium as being a small country in which people are a bit stupid but like to eat well. We've always been very good at keeping ourselves to ourselves. Mentally, so to speak. So with Andr\u00e9 Cools [a politician assassinated nine years ago] and then Dutroux, this whole perception changed. We came to be seen as what we are - a very corrupted society, to a point exceedingly sinister. The aim now, in art as elsewhere, it seems to me, should be to examine not what is unconscious, but what is conscious.'</p> <p>The mass demonstrations in Belgium happened in 1996. A year later, they were re-enacted in microcosm in London when relatives of child murder victims and MAMA (Mothers Against Murder and Aggression) descended on Burlington House in Piccadilly to plead with people queueing for the Sensation show not to enter because it featured a billboard-sized portrait of Myra Hindley by Marcus Harvey.

      "bodyText": "It isn't possible yet to say how the new invented tradition of laying soft toys and flowers at the scene of an accident or other bloody event started, although the roots probably lie in the street shrines of South America and India. What is clear is that it was an artist, the American Mike Kelley, who was talking about dolls 'accenting the pathetic's darker side' and using stuffed animals in his work in the 80s, a decade or so before shopping-centre and suburban street-corner shrines became a familiar part of the emotional and media landscape in this country. Kelley rescued chewed and smelly teddy bears and bunny rabbits from jumble sales and thrift stores and arranged them, clumped or individually, on dirty blankets on polished gallery floors. Although still virtually unknown here, Kelley has been a major influence on two generations of British artists who have used abject and degraded materials as a matter of course in their work. 'There are often unacknowledged but painfully obvious things going on around us,' Liam Gillick, who came through Goldsmiths with Sarah Lucas and Damien Hirst, once said. 'Kelley, and others such as Raymond Pettibon, Jim Shaw and Sue Williams have reinvigorated the debates around where we all stand in relation to shitting, dying, feeling paranoid and not really caring.' But for many years, Kelley had a hard time of it in America. He has made 'dolls' out of faeces. Nostalgic Depiction of the Innocence of Childhood shows a naked man and woman squatting on the floor astride soft toys. The man's buttocks are smeared with a dark chocolatey substance and he appears to be rubbing a fluffy rabbit up against himself. 'His body of work is often taken as a demonstration that art not only doesn't have to be appealing,' one critic has written, 'but that anything appealing in it is by definition not art.' Kelley's 'transgressive' representations of American life still tend to be viewed there as just another embodiment of its ugliness. I thought about Mike Kelley and his failure to return my calls (he is a notoriously reluctant interviewee) on the way to see Luc Tuymans in Belgium. Like Kelley, Tuymans is drawn to the banal and the dejected and to bilious, highly uncomfortable representations of childhood. Unusually (almost uniquely) for a sought-after young artist, Tuymans is a painter. His paintings typically have titles such as Repulsion , Embitterment , Incest , Resentment , Child Abuse , The Murderer . On a material level they are pitiable objects, thin and slapdash, the pictorial equivalent of Kelley's rag-doll installations. 'A lot of my imagery has a sense of coziness which is turned into something terrifying. Anything banal can be transformed into horror,' Tuymans has said. 'Violence is the only structure underlying my work.' Kelley and Tuymans are two of the dozen or so artists in Apocalypse, intended to be the autumn blockbuster show at the Royal Academy, designed to have them chewing the carpets in Great Missenden and Orpington. Subtitled Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art, Apocalypse is meant to be a kind of son-of-Sensation. In the show's catalogue, the co-curator Norman Rosenthal quotes Nietzsche on the importance of facing up to difficult knowledge, 'although it may be ugly and even deadly': 'Artists_ are best positioned to affect our knowledge by confronting us with a synthesis of new and often shocking realities_ The ability to look, make and map where no one has looked before is the aim of every artist and exhibition.' Already, though, a month before Apocalypse opened, David Lee, reliable no-goer and nay-sayer, had delivered his verdict to the London Evening Standard : 'Disgusting works with profane titles, profane works with disgusting titles, disgusting works with disgusting titles by disgusting artists'. Rosenthal is pissing in the wind. The day I travelled to Antwerp to meet Luc Tuymans was the day after the funeral of the murdered eight-year-old, Sarah Payne, and the newspapers all carried front-page stories and pictures. The Eurostar was full of the kind of photographs that had dominated the papers all summer: photographs of Sarah Payne's parents, her brothers and sister; photographs of floral tributes and Beanie Babies and weeping neighbours; photographs of the small white coffin in its Victorian hearse. The papers had also been full of other, angrier pictures all summer, in the wake of the News of the World 's 'name and shame' anti-paedophile campaign. Pictures of smashed windows and daubed houses and 'vigilante' marchers with children in prams and banners saying, 'People don't want no paedophiles here', 'No paedophile scum on this estate'. 'Memes' is Richard Dawkins' word for those ideas that now and again surge through the culture, that proliferate and, sometimes, develop seemingly without specific ownership or particularity. When I had finished reading about Sarah Payne's funeral, I turned to the book of Luc Tuymans paintings that I had brought with me, and the commentary to the paintings that Tuymans had attached. Body , one of his best-known images, shows the headless and legless torso of a school-age girl. It is ghostly with a dull, cracked surface, and bled of all colour. 'It is the torso of a doll, with a zip fastener in the middle so you can open it up to put in stuffing and give it volume, a meaning,' Tuymans says of this small work. 'You can hardly see that the body looks as though it is injured, suffering the effects of cruelty. The zip fastener acts like a wound, like a cut.' Body is the painting of a child that is in fact a doll. Silence depicts a doll that turns out to be a child. It is equally anaemic, equally mute. 'Beneath its closed eyes, two colours appear, green and orange, which, taken together, form a superimposition. They indicate that the face is maimed from within, that it is ill,' Tuymans explains. 'It is as though the child has been infected by a virus which has spread through its whole body. The painting corresponds to complete silence.' There are others: Silent Music , which is an airless nursery room, stuffed with sinister furniture; Smell , based on the deodorant blocks you find in toilets; Incest , the abstraction of a hand sticking through something. The surface of Gas Chamber , on the other hand, which you would expect to be blackly sombre, is suffused with a honeyed orange glow. 'The picture radiates both fear and human warmth. That's actually its meaning. To approach the really terrible thing that cannot be depicted.' 'Phantom figuration' and 'ghost painting' are some of the things Tuymans' style has been called. His pictures are universally bleak, gloomy even; indifferent; petrified. They seem shockingly casual - casually daubed with a scratchy brush while his mind was absent, thinking of something else. Tuymans' paintings are like half-thoughts; they are notoriously elusive (but they stay around - they are haunting; they haunt you): they have been likened to overexposed photographs or barely legible images on shrouds. We departed Lille and I flipped to the front of the book, where there was an interview with Tuymans. Q: 'Some of your paintings focus on the representation of childhood. Some details induce the viewer to think about childhood as fraught with horror, with unease, open to torment, abuse, ailment.' A: 'The idea of fear is pretty much embedded in my personality. Constant fear and constant uneasiness_ Fear of the dark, of physical mutilation, which were instilled very early on in me.' In answer to another question: 'For me, it's impossible to make a joyful painting.' His studio is in a working-class district of Antwerp, mainly occupied by Moroccans. Now aged 42, Tuymans has had the place - 'I regard it as a kind of protective shell' - for more than half his life. He doesn't live there any more, but it's pretty obvious that the cheerless atmosphere and air of near-dereliction sustain something that he needs for his painting, much as Francis Bacon liked to throw on dust, dirt, candle wax. (Norman Rosenthal says he found Tuymans' studio strongly reminiscent of Bacon's reeking, rubbish-strewn London studio in South Kensington.) Tuymans works on to unstretched canvas, nailed to the wall - paintings of King Leopold and other emblems of the Belgian imperium in the Congo; pictures that were uncharacteristic of Tuymans in their generosity of scale and use of colour and even allusions to a narrative element. Also some smaller works, painted on to newspaper, for an upcoming show in Japan. Most of his pictures depict rooms. Some of the rooms are evidently, or by implication, the scene of a crime. Bloodstains and Child Abuse are self-explanatory. Apple is the image of a decaying apple, taken from a police archive photograph of a murder scene. Tuymans works in a very small room with a big mirror. It can feel as if there's something a bit Rillington Place about it, a bit imminent and loaded - forensic, evidentiary - when you come to it fresh from the work. Plus, Tuymans isn't exactly overburdened with social skills. He seemed offhand and quite prepared to be disliked - always a good sign. He chain-smokes. He's arrogant. A mountain of dog-ends was spilling out of a deep bowl on to the floor. For an ashtray, he used the kind of small round mirror you expect to find in a budgie's cage; it sat on the arm of an armchair with its stuffing poking out looking, with the light swimming in it, like the kind of indeterminate, shifting image he likes to make in paint. A scab that turns out to be an embroidered flower. A skull that turns out to be the X-ray of a diseased tooth. An obscene gash that turns out to be the shadow thrown by a small girl's knee. Tuymans says he likes an image to stale. He picks it and then lets it hang around long enough to go dead on him, before he tries to embalm it in paint. No painting takes longer than a day, an unbreakable rule. There are preparatory drawings and watercolour sketches and then - indifferently, eventually - the small, malignly resonating, creepily beautiful, real thing. Occasionally the thing Tuymans finds on the wall staring back at him has the power to unnerve even him. This happened with Child Abuse . 'The colours are exagerrated, ugly. They glow dimly... I painted the picture quite unconsciously, and even I was shocked by the result... The idea of subversion, a perversity, becomes apparent in it.' Tuymans' work, like much of the work on show over the next three months at the Royal Academy, represents a kind of anti-sublime - what the artist Jake Chapman has called, only half-jokingly, a 'degenerate sublime'. It takes art about as far from the pleasure principle as it can be taken. In Tuymans' case, this is conscious. His work, he will patiently explain, sets out to reveal the cruelty and harshness of things. He despises a painter like Kandinsky for whom painting aspired to the condition of music. There's no place in Tuymans' life for music. He never listens to the radio. He told me he has never bought a record. 'Never. Not one. I have no urge to buy - what do you call them - CDs. I'm not so much interested in the spiritual aspect of culture - \"beauty\" or poetic descriptions of beauty don't seem real enough for me. Reality is actually far more important than any form of spirituality. Realism. It's much more interesting to crawl from underneath to the so-called top.' It is all a long way from Matisse, who spoke of his art of 'serenity, balance and repose' as providing restoration 'like a good armchair'. But maybe this is inevitable. Good art sucks in the psyche of its time, and our time isn't about beauty and order and the imitation of nature. Disorder, fear, Bacon's 'smell of death' were the central 20th-century experiences. Antwerp, where Tuymans lives, and Monchen gladbach on the German-Dutch border, where Gregor Schneider, another Apocalypse contributor, has a house, are both about 70km from Charlerois, in southern Belgium. Charlerois is where Marc Dutroux lived. Dutroux, who still hasn't come to trial, is accused of the abduction of six young girls, and the murder of four of them. Two of the children, just eight years old, were kept locked in a small cell in Dutroux's basement, where eventually they starved to death while their captor was in prison for four months. After the police arrested Dutroux, they discovered two other abducted girls, aged 12 and 14, still alive in the home-made dungeon. 'They were held in a white-painted concrete \"cave\" measuring 2m by 3m,' Time reported. 'The cell was cleverly concealed by sliding doors behind a basement cabinet.' There is an uncanny correspondence between this description of Dutroux's terrifying 'dungeon' and the dark, dank room that Gregor Schneider will be installing at the Royal Academy. It is the cellar of his own plain house in Rheydt, a suburb of Monchengladbach, hacked out stone by stone and removed bodily to London. The atmosphere of ominousness and dread that the two spaces have in common may be coincidental, but it isn't accidental. Although he is still only 31, Schneider has an interest in murder and what he calls 'places charged with a strong past event, but from which the event itself is absent' which dates back many years. His work, according to Rosenthal, 'exists in a space between the normal and the pathological'. The 'guest room' of Schneider's house in Rheydt has no windows and is clad with sheets of sound-proofing and lead covering. (Luc Tuymans has coincidentally done a set of paintings called Sealed Rooms . Mike Kelley has incorporated crawl spaces into several works.) Elsewhere in the house, walls have been built in front of walls, ceilings under ceilings, windows in front of windows. The 'coffee room' rotates 360 imperceptibly on its own axis: leaving by the door they arrived through, visitors risk stepping into a void. The house is riddled with the crawl spaces and deep shafts that Schneider has been excavating and modifying and concealing since he was 16. As a schoolboy, he obsessively photographed a place in the woods where a female art student had been murdered. He has been interested to discover 'whether a scream would stay behind in a room after you had left it'. Under the floor, there is a birdcage, dead animals, inflatable dolls. 'I'd love to stop someone getting away one time,' Schneider has said, 'but I have never dared to yet. I'm one of those people who live double lives and go out into the park at night and sift through the litter bins and secretly take something home with me_ I assume that there are others working at it and I will probably never meet the best ones.' The interesting thing is that both Tuymans and Schneider had been set on their paths for many years before the national trauma of Dutroux. For his last show in New York, it was naturally assumed that Tuymans was alluding to the paedophile scandal that had wracked his country, and to the occasion of the White March in Brussels, when 300,000 took to the streets to protest against the official incompetence and corruption that had made the system rotten. It was natural to assume it, but it wasn't necessarily the case. 'Until that point,' Tuymans says, 'everyone looked at Belgium as being a small country in which people are a bit stupid but like to eat well. We've always been very good at keeping ourselves to ourselves. Mentally, so to speak. So with Andr\u00e9 Cools [a politician assassinated nine years ago] and then Dutroux, this whole perception changed. We came to be seen as what we are - a very corrupted society, to a point exceedingly sinister. The aim now, in art as elsewhere, it seems to me, should be to examine not what is unconscious, but what is conscious.' The mass demonstrations in Belgium happened in 1996. A year later, they were re-enacted in microcosm in London when relatives of child murder victims and MAMA (Mothers Against Murder and Aggression) descended on Burlington House in Piccadilly to plead with people queueing for the Sensation show not to enter because it featured a billboard-sized portrait of Myra Hindley by Marcus Harvey. Shortly afterwards, two men vandalised the picture. The Mirror featured the damaged painting in full colour on its front page accompanied by the caption: 'Exhibited by the Royal Academy in the so-called name of art, defaced by the people in the name of common decency'. Myra , like everything else in Sensation, was owned by Charles Saatchi. Saatchi's position as the most powerful collector of this kind of art in Europe is unassailable. It is precisely his status as a 'powermongrel' which makes Luc Tuymans disinclined to sell to him. 'The grip he holds has molested a lot of possibilities,' Tuymans says. 'In the past 10 years, Charles Saatchi has stripped the art of its political content.' Tuymans' work would be drowned out in the Saatchi Collection (as it might well be in the bombast of Apocalypse). It doesn't make a lot of noise. Like an inhabitant of Schneider's lead-lined room, the paintings fester inside their own repelling, chilly aura. They remind me of something Italo Calvino wrote just before he died: 'Knowledge of the world means dissolving the solidity of the world_ Were I to choose an auspicious image for the new millennium, [it would be] the sudden agile leap of the poet-philosopher who raises himself above the weight of the world, showing that with all his gravity he has the secret of lightness, and that what many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars.' * Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art runs from 23 September to 15 December at the Royal Academy of Arts, Burlington House, Piccadilly, London W1 (020 7300 8000; www.royalacademy.org",

      "body": "<p> Thank God the summer \u00eds over - no really. We've seen enough male-orientated bombast this year. Tom Cruise climbing the Grand Canyon with his little finger. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg relishing the whiff of tuna fish on rough, simulated seas. </p> <p>Aside from the Hollywood blockbusters, we've been inundated with further additions to the blokish Lock, Stock school ( Love Honour and Obey , Essex Boys ) climaxing in the disappointing Snatch . And just in case the New Men among you were feeling left out we've had High Fidelity with yet another thirtysomething male unable to bear the smell of commitment. </p> <p>So those feeling a lack of gender balance will be relieved to hear that the female counter to High Fidelity is here. </p> <p>In Love &amp; Sex a thirtysomething woman offers up a retrospective, step-by-step guide to her sexual and relationship history in a series of vignettes shot through with sexy shenanigans and a smart soundtrack. It's a low-budget affair (though not one low on energy, impact and gags) from writer/director Valerie Breiman. Her stated aim is to provide an alternative to the 'overwhelmingly action and teen-orientated industry where the teen male is taking over'. </p> <p> Love &amp; Sex is Breiman's semi-autobiographical tale of a man and woman meeting at the wrong time in their lives, splitting up and then labouring to rekindle what's lost. Kate (Famke Janssen) is a journalist, at odds with her magazine Monique 's Cosmo ethics because they don't ring true to her own life. As an act of rebellion she hands in a feature 'Suck It And See' (on blow jobs as a cure for depression) instead of a piece on how to have successful relationships. She is immediately sacked by her editor-bitch-boss. </p> <p>The thrust of the story concerns her relationship with her perfect man, Adam (Jon Favreau). The two fizzle together (a strong point of Love &amp; Sex is the naturalistic chemistry between Janssen and Favreau), cohabit and progress from lust into friendship and finally stalemate. The remainder of the movie is a 'will they, won't they get it back together' scenario. </p> <p>Breiman offers a plethora of one-liners as we skip merrily along, witticisms (or clich\u00e9s depending on your view) like 'love is a minefield, you'd rather blow up than be single'. But is it saying anything new? </p> <p>Breiman calls it a 'dirty romantic comedy', and continues: 'Women are a lot more sophisticated and nasty than we give them credit for. Female movies have been far too sweet and sappy. Women need to be making more films and ones that don't fit into that gooey category.' </p> <p>However, glad that I am that the bachelorette is finally getting some on-screen time, does Love &amp; Sex offer much more than a run-through of age-old themes... love versus sex, can men and women be friends? Television treats these themes with some aplomb on Sex and the City and Ally McBeal . And they are treated with some wit and insight by a host of female novelists led by Helen Fielding. </p> <p>In cinema history, the tag a 'woman's film' has been used to describe very different movies, from Powell and Pressburger's I Know Where I'm Going (1945) - with its conflict between duty and love - to Julie Christie's freewheeling It-girl in John Schlesinger's Darling (1965). In recent years, we have enjoyed the feisty role models offered up by Ridley Scott's Thelma and Louise and John Dahl's The Last Seduction. </p> <p>However, it would be difficult to argue that the more recent the film, the more progressive is its take on female behaviour. Place Love &amp; Sex, for instance, next to Gainsborough Studios' run of transgressive female characters.

      "bodyText": "Thank God the summer \u00eds over - no really. We've seen enough male-orientated bombast this year. Tom Cruise climbing the Grand Canyon with his little finger. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg relishing the whiff of tuna fish on rough, simulated seas. Aside from the Hollywood blockbusters, we've been inundated with further additions to the blokish Lock, Stock school ( Love Honour and Obey , Essex Boys ) climaxing in the disappointing Snatch . And just in case the New Men among you were feeling left out we've had High Fidelity with yet another thirtysomething male unable to bear the smell of commitment. So those feeling a lack of gender balance will be relieved to hear that the female counter to High Fidelity is here. In Love &amp; Sex a thirtysomething woman offers up a retrospective, step-by-step guide to her sexual and relationship history in a series of vignettes shot through with sexy shenanigans and a smart soundtrack. It's a low-budget affair (though not one low on energy, impact and gags) from writer/director Valerie Breiman. Her stated aim is to provide an alternative to the 'overwhelmingly action and teen-orientated industry where the teen male is taking over'. Love &amp; Sex is Breiman's semi-autobiographical tale of a man and woman meeting at the wrong time in their lives, splitting up and then labouring to rekindle what's lost. Kate (Famke Janssen) is a journalist, at odds with her magazine Monique 's Cosmo ethics because they don't ring true to her own life. As an act of rebellion she hands in a feature 'Suck It And See' (on blow jobs as a cure for depression) instead of a piece on how to have successful relationships. She is immediately sacked by her editor-bitch-boss. The thrust of the story concerns her relationship with her perfect man, Adam (Jon Favreau). The two fizzle together (a strong point of Love &amp; Sex is the naturalistic chemistry between Janssen and Favreau), cohabit and progress from lust into friendship and finally stalemate. The remainder of the movie is a 'will they, won't they get it back together' scenario. Breiman offers a plethora of one-liners as we skip merrily along, witticisms (or clich\u00e9s depending on your view) like 'love is a minefield, you'd rather blow up than be single'. But is it saying anything new? Breiman calls it a 'dirty romantic comedy', and continues: 'Women are a lot more sophisticated and nasty than we give them credit for. Female movies have been far too sweet and sappy. Women need to be making more films and ones that don't fit into that gooey category.' However, glad that I am that the bachelorette is finally getting some on-screen time, does Love &amp; Sex offer much more than a run-through of age-old themes... love versus sex, can men and women be friends? Television treats these themes with some aplomb on Sex and the City and Ally McBeal . And they are treated with some wit and insight by a host of female novelists led by Helen Fielding. In cinema history, the tag a 'woman's film' has been used to describe very different movies, from Powell and Pressburger's I Know Where I'm Going (1945) - with its conflict between duty and love - to Julie Christie's freewheeling It-girl in John Schlesinger's Darling (1965). In recent years, we have enjoyed the feisty role models offered up by Ridley Scott's Thelma and Louise and John Dahl's The Last Seduction. However, it would be difficult to argue that the more recent the film, the more progressive is its take on female behaviour. Place Love &amp; Sex, for instance, next to Gainsborough Studios' run of transgressive female characters. Forties Britain was ablaze with The Wicked Lady (1945), Madonna of the Seven Moons (1944), Black Narcissus (1946) and Jassy (1947) and though Margaret Lockwood, Kathleen Byron and Phyllis Calvert were punished for their sociopathic behaviour it didn't stop them being enjoyable to watch. In the Seventies, newly single Jill Clayburgh caught the zeitgeist in An Unmarried Woman as a woman entering the dating minefield.

Breiman argues that Love &amp; Sex 'speaks' to 'women who've seen it, from 20 to 45'. They have said, she claims: 'This is my life.' I'm not so sure. As a result of seeing Love &amp; Sex my friends are under strict instructions that if my lovely boyfriend leaves me they must: a) shoot me if I get a cat; b) stab me if I start going on about becoming an anorexic model; and c) throttle me if I prioritise men over my work and mates.

      "body": "<p> You knew Winona Ryder had made it when she appeared on The Simpsons , way back in 1994, the year she became the first lady of slacker culture in Reality Bites . Unlike other hallowed Simpsons guest stars such as Mel Brooks, Elizabeth Taylor and Paul McCartney she didn't appear as herself - Ryder took the same route as Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathleen Turner and Glenn Close and played a one-off character. In the episode entitled 'Lisa's Rival', she provided the voice for gifted student Allison Taylor, put up a year at Springfield Elementary because she was 'getting bored with first grade'. She challenges Lisa's saxophone supremacy and almost wins the school's diorama contest with an elaborate scene from Poe's The Telltale Heart . </p> <p>It's tempting to trace a link between the precocious, talented, slightly gothic Allison and the precocious, talented, slightly gothic Winona, though in reality she was kicked out of high school for being a 'distraction', felt isolated from her classmates and was partly educated at home by hippie parents. After years of winning Hollywood's diorama contests - feted by critics, adored by fans, most importantly respected by the industry - Ryder, still only 28, is currently going through something of a losing patch. And we're not just talking about breaking up with Matt Damon. Nicholas Hytner, who directed her at her peak in Arthur Miller's The Crucible , commented at the time thatRyder 'has a good career because she never worries about her career'. Perhaps she should start. </p> <p>This autumn sees two poor Ryder films in succession. Lost Souls is her first proper horror flick - if you discount Francis Coppola's opulent Dracula , which was more of a period piece - and it promises to be a disaster, having been in a holding pattern for a whole year now. New Line planned to release it in the US in October 1999, but yanked it for fear of clashing with End Of Days and Stigmata , which had a similar pre-millennial religious theme. Pencilled in for a February release, it was pulled again - this time running scared of Scream 3 . Presumably New Line were extra-wary after the way their previous Rosemary's Baby rip-off, The Astronaut's Wife , had nosedived. </p> <p> Lost Souls , also starring Ben Chaplin and John Hurt, is now slated for an October release here and in the States - a second coming, if you will - although it has been erroneously trailered over there with a cap tion advertising its 'Fall 1999' release. Oops. The runes are not good, especially when a screening spy on the Ain't It Cool News website has already posted the pithy review: 'The movie is bad; the ending is worse.' </p> <p>Ryder's other seasonal turkey is Autumn In New York , a soppy love story with Richard Gere that may, due to the specifics of its title, take some time to reach these shores (it isn't even scheduled at present). Gere, playing the ageing playboy who falls in love with Ryder's terminally ill designer, railed against MGM's suicidal decision not to screen the film to US critics before release, although he stuck to the party line which was that 'the studio felt that it was important not to reveal plot points'. Right. </p> <p> Autumn In New York actually did okay business in its first week - thanks to what we're told was a 70 per cent female turnout - but word of mouth sent its takings down by half in week two. </p> <p>Those who elevated Ryder to the status of Hollywood's avenging angel in the early Nineties and pinned on her the hopes of Gen-X takeover must be wondering what happened to their once-hopeful indie darling. 'The actress of her generation,' they called her; a cross between the two Hepburns, Katharine and Audrey. In the 1994 update of David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary Of Film , he granted Ryder an entry, having handpicked her from a list of 'beautiful young women who might make it' (including Bridget Fonda, Nicole Kidman and Uma Thurman). 'I'm gambling on Winona Ryder,' he wrote, 'for no other reason than the feeling that she's been extraordinary already a few times.' </p> <p>It was a safe enough bet. Ryder had indeed been extraordinary 'a few times' in 1994 - and twice Oscar nominated, for Little Women and The Age Of Innocence . Perfectly cast as the goth teen in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice and as the murderous, pallid outsider in Heathers , she also excelled as Jerry Lee Lewis's junior bride in Great Balls Of Fire and gave a surprisingly naturalistic turn in Edward Scissorhands (Burton again) amid the hyper-real cartoonery. Still to come when Thomson put his money on the table was The Crucible , with Ryder at her career-best as vengeful Abigail, charged with the same crime as Ryder at high school: being a witch. </p> <p>But if all looked well on screen, it masked an emotionally unsettled time at home. By all accounts a delicate soul ('I blow over when it's windy,' she said), Ryder had started going out with Depp after Edward Scissorhands . She was only 18 at the time. Depp had 'WINONA FOREVER' tattooed on his arm to mark their engagement, and the couple became the Brad and Jennifer of their day. </p> <p>But the crown prince and princess of indie were not long to reign over us. They parted in 1993, and Depp had his tattoo rather humorously 'edited' by laser surgery to read 'WINO FOREVER'. It hit Ryder hard. Unable to sleep, she took to driving around in the middle of the night. One story has her chancing upon a newsstand and seeing herself on a glossy magazine cover under the headline, 'Winona Ryder: The Luckiest Girl in the World.' </p> <p>This discrepancy between public perception and private pain is not unique in Hollywood. The romantic merry-go-round which fuels the gossip sheets may keep us all entertained, but in reality it leaves a lot of people rattling around an empty house, emotionally speaking. After Depp - who moved on to another slip of a girl, Kate Moss - Ryder took up with dreadlocked rock singer Dave Pirner of grungers-by-association Soul Asy lum (ironically, around this time she started to 'get into' classical music). This relationship ended in 1997, and she went against her own beatnik stereotype by seeing Hollywood's new golden boy Matt Damon (not the tattooed type). They also became engaged, but the relationship stalled in March this year, and Ryder has since been linked with another rock star eccentric, Beck. Her upbringing on a California commune and the fact that acid guru Timothy Leary was her godfather seem to have some bearing on the type of man she chooses. </p> <p>The question is, does Ryder have any interest in being some 'It' girl whose social couplings are eagerly reported in supermarket tabloids, or is she in this for the acting? Since her awkward attempt at playing the quasi-action hero in Alien Resurrection , craft seems to have taken a second place to sensation. Excursions into horror ( Lost Souls ) and Disease Of The Week territory ( Autumn In New York ) merely confirm that the actress has lost her way somewhat since turning 25. </p> <p> A ray of hope for Winona lovers came this year with Girl, Interrupted , which Empire magazine described as 'Charlie's Angels Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'. The thinking person's 'teen flick', it was based on Susanne Kaysen's memoir of her spell in a mental institution for which Ryder bought the rights in 1993, eventually taking it to the screen as first-time producer (she even picked the director: Heavy and Copland 's James Mangold). Ryder had booked herself into a psychiatric hospital aged 19 after pulling out of The Godfather III because of nervous exhaustion, so Girl, Interrupted was personal for her. It did reasonable business (around $28 million at home), but her thunder was well and truly stolen by more conventionally glamorous co-star Angelina Jolie, who won an Oscar. </p> <p>So where next for Ryder? She vowed she would never direct, but then she said the same about producing. In truth, there has always been more to her than meets the eye. She's a natural blonde for a start, and yet her raven hair is her trademark. She is a slight 5ft 4 - one interviewer commented: 'Everything, her wrists, her ears, her feet, is in miniature, as though the shrinking process she underwent in Beetlejuice has not quite worn off' - and yet she still wields power in Hollywood, and when a girl who'd beaten her up in school turned up for an autograph she told her: 'Go fuck yourself.' </p> <p>Ryder doesn't fit in, and this is the very reason we loved her in the first place. Her defiant refusal to do nude scenes is just one of the reasons she towers above the likes of Angelina Jolie. She is odd and honest and self-effacing (she described herself as a 'wet noodle' after the Godfather III incident) - which is why her potential slide into schlock is so alarming. Perhaps, like her Simpsons character, she's just 'bored with the first grade' and wants to skip ahead to being a safe thirtysomething. </p> <p>In accordance with her godfather Leary's famous words, we must hope that Ryder tunes in and turns on, rather than drops out. </p> <p>\u0095 Lost Souls opens on 3 November </p> <p><strong>Success, interrupted,,,</strong></p> <p><strong> Heathers (1989)</strong> </p> <p>Eighteen-year-old Ryder finds her niche as outsider Veronica at Westerberg High. She busts out of the lofty 'Heathers' clique by hooking up with Christian Slater's biker, embarking upon a killing spree of revenge. </p> <p><strong> The age of innocence (1993)</strong> </p> <p>Ryder enters her twenties and goes 'legit' in Martin Scorsese's lavish adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel about 1870s New York. She earned her first Oscar nomination. </p> <p><strong> Alien resurrection (1997)</strong> </p> <p>Weakest link in the saga, this chapter miscast Ryder as a space pirate sent to kill Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the alien within. She's really a robot, which explains everything. </p> <p><strong> Girl, interrupted (1999)</strong> </p> <p>Ryder's first vanity project (she also produced), this Sixties-set asylum drama echoed her own spell 'inside' at 19 (blame Johnny Depp). Outperformed by Angelina Jolie.</p>",

In the episode entitled 'Lisa's Rival', she provided the voice for gifted student Allison Taylor, put up a year at Springfield Elementary because she was 'getting bored with first grade'. She challenges Lisa's saxophone supremacy and almost wins the school's diorama contest with an elaborate scene from Poe's The Telltale Heart . It's tempting to trace a link between the precocious, talented, slightly gothic Allison and the precocious, talented, slightly gothic Winona, though in reality she was kicked out of high school for being a 'distraction', felt isolated from her classmates and was partly educated at home by hippie parents. After years of winning Hollywood's diorama contests - feted by critics, adored by fans, most importantly respected by the industry - Ryder, still only 28, is currently going through something of a losing patch. And we're not just talking about breaking up with Matt Damon. Nicholas Hytner, who directed her at her peak in Arthur Miller's The Crucible , commented at the time thatRyder 'has a good career because she never worries about her career'. Perhaps she should start. This autumn sees two poor Ryder films in succession. Lost Souls is her first proper horror flick - if you discount Francis Coppola's opulent Dracula , which was more of a period piece - and it promises to be a disaster, having been in a holding pattern for a whole year now. New Line planned to release it in the US in October 1999, but yanked it for fear of clashing with End Of Days and Stigmata , which had a similar pre-millennial religious theme. Pencilled in for a February release, it was pulled again - this time running scared of Scream 3 . Presumably New Line were extra-wary after the way their previous Rosemary's Baby rip-off, The Astronaut's Wife , had nosedived. Lost Souls , also starring Ben Chaplin and John Hurt, is now slated for an October release here and in the States - a second coming, if you will - although it has been erroneously trailered over there with a cap tion advertising its 'Fall 1999' release. Oops. The runes are not good, especially when a screening spy on the Ain't It Cool News website has already posted the pithy review: 'The movie is bad; the ending is worse.' Ryder's other seasonal turkey is Autumn In New York , a soppy love story with Richard Gere that may, due to the specifics of its title, take some time to reach these shores (it isn't even scheduled at present). Gere, playing the ageing playboy who falls in love with Ryder's terminally ill designer, railed against MGM's suicidal decision not to screen the film to US critics before release, although he stuck to the party line which was that 'the studio felt that it was important not to reveal plot points'. Right. Autumn In New York actually did okay business in its first week - thanks to what we're told was a 70 per cent female turnout - but word of mouth sent its takings down by half in week two. Those who elevated Ryder to the status of Hollywood's avenging angel in the early Nineties and pinned on her the hopes of Gen-X takeover must be wondering what happened to their once-hopeful indie darling. 'The actress of her generation,' they called her; a cross between the two Hepburns, Katharine and Audrey. In the 1994 update of David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary Of Film , he granted Ryder an entry, having handpicked her from a list of 'beautiful young women who might make it' (including Bridget Fonda, Nicole Kidman and Uma Thurman). 'I'm gambling on Winona Ryder,' he wrote, 'for no other reason than the feeling that she's been extraordinary already a few times.' It was a safe enough bet. Ryder had indeed been extraordinary 'a few times' in 1994 - and twice Oscar nominated, for Little Women and The Age Of Innocence . Perfectly cast as the goth teen in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice and as the murderous, pallid outsider in Heathers , she also excelled as Jerry Lee Lewis's junior bride in Great Balls Of Fire and gave a surprisingly naturalistic turn in Edward Scissorhands (Burton again) amid the hyper-real cartoonery. Still to come when Thomson put his money on the table was The Crucible , with Ryder at her career-best as vengeful Abigail, charged with the same crime as Ryder at high school: being a witch. But if all looked well on screen, it masked an emotionally unsettled time at home. By all accounts a delicate soul ('I blow over when it's windy,' she said), Ryder had started going out with Depp after Edward Scissorhands . She was only 18 at the time. Depp had 'WINONA FOREVER' tattooed on his arm to mark their engagement, and the couple became the Brad and Jennifer of their day. But the crown prince and princess of indie were not long to reign over us. They parted in 1993, and Depp had his tattoo rather humorously 'edited' by laser surgery to read 'WINO FOREVER'. It hit Ryder hard. Unable to sleep, she took to driving around in the middle of the night. One story has her chancing upon a newsstand and seeing herself on a glossy magazine cover under the headline, 'Winona Ryder: The Luckiest Girl in the World.' This discrepancy between public perception and private pain is not unique in Hollywood. The romantic merry-go-round which fuels the gossip sheets may keep us all entertained, but in reality it leaves a lot of people rattling around an empty house, emotionally speaking. After Depp - who moved on to another slip of a girl, Kate Moss - Ryder took up with dreadlocked rock singer Dave Pirner of grungers-by-association Soul Asy lum (ironically, around this time she started to 'get into' classical music). This relationship ended in 1997, and she went against her own beatnik stereotype by seeing Hollywood's new golden boy Matt Damon (not the tattooed type). They also became engaged, but the relationship stalled in March this year, and Ryder has since been linked with another rock star eccentric, Beck. Her upbringing on a California commune and the fact that acid guru Timothy Leary was her godfather seem to have some bearing on the type of man she chooses. The question is, does Ryder have any interest in being some 'It' girl whose social couplings are eagerly reported in supermarket tabloids, or is she in this for the acting? Since her awkward attempt at playing the quasi-action hero in Alien Resurrection , craft seems to have taken a second place to sensation. Excursions into horror ( Lost Souls ) and Disease Of The Week territory ( Autumn In New York ) merely confirm that the actress has lost her way somewhat since turning 25. A ray of hope for Winona lovers came this year with Girl, Interrupted , which Empire magazine described as 'Charlie's Angels Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'. The thinking person's 'teen flick', it was based on Susanne Kaysen's memoir of her spell in a mental institution for which Ryder bought the rights in 1993, eventually taking it to the screen as first-time producer (she even picked the director: Heavy and Copland 's James Mangold). Ryder had booked herself into a psychiatric hospital aged 19 after pulling out of The Godfather III because of nervous exhaustion, so Girl, Interrupted was personal for her. It did reasonable business (around $28 million at home), but her thunder was well and truly stolen by more conventionally glamorous co-star Angelina Jolie, who won an Oscar. So where next for Ryder? She vowed she would never direct, but then she said the same about producing. In truth, there has always been more to her than meets the eye. She's a natural blonde for a start, and yet her raven hair is her trademark. She is a slight 5ft 4 - one interviewer commented: 'Everything, her wrists, her ears, her feet, is in miniature, as though the shrinking process she underwent in Beetlejuice has not quite worn off' - and yet she still wields power in Hollywood, and when a girl who'd beaten her up in school turned up for an autograph she told her: 'Go fuck yourself.' Ryder doesn't fit in, and this is the very reason we loved her in the first place. Her defiant refusal to do nude scenes is just one of the reasons she towers above the likes of Angelina Jolie. She is odd and honest and self-effacing (she described herself as a 'wet noodle' after the Godfather III incident) - which is why her potential slide into schlock is so alarming. Perhaps, like her Simpsons character, she's just 'bored with the first grade' and wants to skip ahead to being a safe thirtysomething. In accordance with her godfather Leary's famous words, we must hope that Ryder tunes in and turns on, rather than drops out. \u0095 Lost Souls opens on 3 November Success, interrupted,,, Heathers (1989) Eighteen-year-old Ryder finds her niche as outsider Veronica at Westerberg High. She busts out of the lofty 'Heathers' clique by hooking up with Christian Slater's biker, embarking upon a killing spree of revenge. The age of innocence (1993) Ryder enters her twenties and goes 'legit' in Martin Scorsese's lavish adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel about 1870s New York. She earned her first Oscar nomination. Alien resurrection (1997) Weakest link in the saga, this chapter miscast Ryder as a space pirate sent to kill Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the alien within. She's really a robot, which explains everything. Girl, interrupted (1999) Ryder's first vanity project (she also produced), this Sixties-set asylum drama echoed her own spell 'inside' at 19 (blame Johnny Depp). Outperformed by Angelina Jolie.",

'The most important invention of the twentieth century became the Queen's private property for five crucial years, so that the scientists could get on with their work,' says James Gillies, author of How the web was born .",

Last year's Wimbledon coverage consisted of a reporter commentating on the television coverage. For Euro 2000 MacKenzie went one step further, taking out a series of national newspaper ads promising '27 live matches, one station'. But Talksport didn't have the broadcasting rights.

'Membership of the EBU has been denied for reasons Talksport believes are anti-competitive,' MacKenzie said earlier this year. </p> <p>This exclusion means that, for now, Talksport, backed by Rupert Murdoch and Liberty Media, is chiefly looking to bid for events outside Europe.

The first question from the City concerns Talksport's ability to pay for broadcasting rights in a bid to see off Radio 5. MacKenzie has in the past expressed doubts about outbidding the BBC for rights to events such as Premier League football matches. </p> <p>The second question is whether MacKenzie is paying too much for rights.

      "body": "<p>When a company produces a list of four excuses for its fall in profits, you can be pretty sure that either the business or its communications systems have gone a bit haywire. In Kingfisher's case, it seems to have been both. </p> <p>Despite having guided analysts forecasts down in July, and despite its house broker cutting its forecasts even further just a week ahead of the results, the 20 per cent fall in first-half profits to \u00a3204 million took the City by surprise. </p> <p>That may explain the rather abrupt departure of Kingfisher's investor relations manager. Unfortunately, however, the problems will not be solved simply by shooting the messenger. It is the performance of Comet, Woolworths and Kingfisher's other collection of businesses that is the real concern. </p> <p>Geoff Mulcahy, group chief executive, was a proponent of the idea of cutting prices to drive sales growth long before this became fashionable. </p> <p>The theory was that the extra volumes, backed by ever-falling costs, would protect margins and keep profits moving ahead. The most notable success was at B&amp;Q, which used its market leadership to build bigger and bigger stores, buy cheaper and cheaper stock, and attract more and more customers. The virtuous circle continued in the first half. Like-for-like sales grew by 8 per cent, and profits jumped 17.5 per cent, despite a 4 per cent fall in average prices. </p> <p>At Comet, where the market is more competitive and chief rival Currys is in good shape, price-cutting has had a less obvious impact. In the first half sales rose by 12.6 per cent, excluding new openings, but profits stayed flat and margins dropped. Comet has suffered from lower computer prices and the popularity of the less lucrative pay-as-you-go mobile phone services, but Mulcahy's job is to manage that for shareholders' benefit. </p> <p>At the other British chains, Superdrug and Woolworths, it has been far harder to make this pricing strategy work. Superdrug may be cheaper than Boots, but so are most supermarkets and Boots has yet to show any real pain. Woolworths' odd assortment of goods is hardly the sort shoppers do a price check on. Cutting prices at these chains risks cutting profits.That was borne out by the results at Woolworths and Superdrug, where profits fell 40 per cent despite a \u00a310m investment in 'every day low pricing'. </p> <p>Kingfisher's strategy was built not just on cutting prices in this market. Mulcahy's vision is of an international retailing group, and he is some way ahead of his peers in creating that. Unfortunately, when things go wrong in the UK, the City has a habit of searching for things going wrong elsewhere, too. Castorama, the French do-it-yourself chain, was seen as a bit disappointing and there is concern about the mounting losses at Wegert, the German electrical chain. A confused analysts' presentation did little to dispel the fears. </p> <p>Given these problems it is perhaps not surprising that Kingfisher should announce its intention to demerge Woolworths and Superdrug - demergers are increasingly used to divert attention from poor performance. </p> <p>In some respects, it makes sense. Kingfisher's shares have lagged behind the market by about 30 per cent over the past year. They are now so poorly rated that Mulcahy would find it difficult to raise funds to further his international ambitions. Shorn of the troublesome general merchandising businesses, as Woolies and Superdrug are called, the shares could recover. </p> <p>But to create value for current shareholders, the demerger should also benefit general merchandising. And despite Mulcahy's insistence that he 'passionately believes' that general merchandise is capable of 'major growth', it is not clear where that growth will come from. </p> <p>Kingfisher points to its new formats: Big W, an 85,000 sq ft 'destination store' selling a wide range of goods; Woolworths General Stores, modelled on US drugstores, and Super D, a discount toiletry chain. Together, Mulcahy believes these will add \u00a32.5 billion sales a year - as much as Superdrug and Woolworths combined. That is a tall order and, as one analyst said, there is no point adding those sales if you're not adding profits. </p> <p>Mulcahy's aim may be to attract bidders for Superdrug and Woolworths before the demerger. What is more likely, however, is that vultures will be circling B&amp;Q, Darty and Comet, particularly if, as the City fears, profits do not recover in the second half. That speculation will underpin the shares, but is not sufficient reason to buy. </p> <p><strong> Circle squared</strong><br> It would have been astounding if Blue Circle had produced disappointing results less than six months after fighting off a bid from French rival Lafarge. It duly produced a better-than-expected 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to \u00a3126m for the first half of the year. </p> <p>Much of what it promised during the bid battle has materialised. Malaysia has recovered strongly, turning a \u00a3600,000 loss into a \u00a315.1m profit on the back of a 32 per cent rise in volumes. Prices for cement are hardening everywhere and volumes are expected to continue to rise. Half of the promised \u00a3800m has been handed back to shareholders through a share buy-back and it has achieved \u00a311.6m of the promised \u00a3116m 'operational improvements'. </p> <p>Chief executive Rick Haythornthwaite is confident that it can achieve the remainder: the programme is not just about head office initiatives, it is going all the way through to the cement operations. </p> <p>He is equally confident that he will not have to give away the savings in lower prices to customers. The City, however, is less confident and points to the US, where there are already signs of price pressure. Haythornthwaite says these were shortlived and that roadbuilding programmes will keep US prices and volumes moving ahead. </p> <p>The comfort for shareholders is that, if he is wrong or fails to deliver on cost cuts, Lafarge is still waiting in the wings. It has a 32 per cent stake, and this could rise to 40 per cent if the remaining \u00a3400m is returned via another buy-back. </p> <p>That holding puts a floor on the shares, and it is unlikely they will fall much below 400p. It also puts a ceiling on them, at least in the short-term: the City would not expect Lafarge to pay much more than 500p a share. Buyers should not, therefore, expect too much excitement.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Buyers are lining up to bid for the electrical and do-it-yourself operations of retailing group Kingfisher after it demerges Woolworths and Superdrug next year. </p> <p>City sources say that Home Depot, the US do-it-yourself giant, is likely to mount a bid for B&amp;Q and Castorama, its French equivalent. John Clare, chief executive of Dixons, has made no secret of his interest in Darty, Kingfisher's French electrical chain, but he would have to vie with US rivals Circuit City and Best Buy. The US companies would also be interested in Comet, the British electrical retailer, but Dixons' ownership of the rival Currys chain would probably rule it out. </p> <p>Analysts believe the suitors are likely to wait until the demerger has been completed. That is partly because none would want to take on Superdrug and Woolworths, but also because trading is expected to deteriorate, making the businesses cheaper. 'There is no sense in doing anything today if the dip is expected to accelerate,' said one. </p> <p>Speculation about bidders emerged as Kingfisher shocked the City with disappointing half-year profits and warned that the results for the full-year would also be hit.

      "bodyText": "Buyers are lining up to bid for the electrical and do-it-yourself operations of retailing group Kingfisher after it demerges Woolworths and Superdrug next year. City sources say that Home Depot, the US do-it-yourself giant, is likely to mount a bid for B&amp;Q and Castorama, its French equivalent. John Clare, chief executive of Dixons, has made no secret of his interest in Darty, Kingfisher's French electrical chain, but he would have to vie with US rivals Circuit City and Best Buy. The US companies would also be interested in Comet, the British electrical retailer, but Dixons' ownership of the rival Currys chain would probably rule it out. Analysts believe the suitors are likely to wait until the demerger has been completed. That is partly because none would want to take on Superdrug and Woolworths, but also because trading is expected to deteriorate, making the businesses cheaper. 'There is no sense in doing anything today if the dip is expected to accelerate,' said one. Speculation about bidders emerged as Kingfisher shocked the City with disappointing half-year profits and warned that the results for the full-year would also be hit. One analyst pointed to the 1 per cent fall in the gross margin and said: 'That makes it difficult, even on a 6 per cent like-for-like increase in sales, to see profits progress.' The demerger announcement was seen as an attempt to soften the blow of the first fall in profits for five years, but analysts said it simply made the group more vulnerable to a bid.

      "body": "<p>'We're mad!' Barry Gibson, chief executive of Littlewoods, boomed on the stage of Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall. 'We're going to Make A Difference,' he exhorted 900 senior staff gathered for the catalogue and stores group's annual management conference last Wednesday. </p> <p>The occasion launched Littlewood's latest survival strategy - 'better value retailing' - to take on clothes discounters such as Matalan, New Look and Peacocks, which have hit its high street sales hard. But this year's was no happy-clappy event. With up to 300 job cuts already announced this month and heads starting to roll this week, morale among Littlewoods' staff is at rock-bottom. </p> <p>And, increasingly among senior Littlewoods' insiders and certain members of the controlling Moores family, Gibson and his chairman James Ross are seen as part of the problem, not the solution. 'Everyone is in jitters. It's a bloody mess,' one family member told The Observer last week. 'If I could, I'd change the board and change direction. We need to get profits up, but we also need to raise morale urgently.' </p> <p>Littlewoods has seen its share of ructions in the last decade, as the business has struggled to keep up. But its present straits leave the group in its worst predicament yet, say senior insiders and retail industry figures. The problems, they say, stem directly from key decisions taken since Gibson's appointment three years ago. </p> <p>'Making a difference' is just one of a plethora of initiatives launched by the 48-year-old chief executive, who joined from airports group BAA but began his working life as a Littlewoods management trainee in 1970. </p> <p>In quickfire succession, the 27,000 staff have also been left bewildered by 'back on track', 'changing with pride', 'Project Concorde' and 'Operation Spaceship' - the latter a \u00a310 million brainwave that carved up Littlewoods' 14-storey Liverpool headquarters into open-plan offices 'with ambience'. </p> <p>'Following on from the success of \"changing with pride\" and \"building on pride\" we now bring you \"consolidating with hubris\",' the firm's underground newsletter Then sniped in the summer, adding: 'You could say that means \"harsh unemployment begets a reduction in insolent sods\".' The publication is a spoof of the official staff magazine Now . </p> <p>According to senior retail sources, Littlewoods' core problems can be traced to the biggest overhaul of all - 'Project Rio' (retail integration operation). Begun 18 months ago, it aims to cut \u00a350m of annual costs by consolidating all activities - the department stores, Index catalogue shops and home shopping - as a single trading operation under the Littlewoods name. </p> <p>'Barry believed there were massive savings to be made by reinventing the brand name for everything,' one senior source said. 'The problem is that stores and mail order are completely different, with different customers, stock and credit control demands.' </p> <p>Conceived by Gibson shortly after his appointment, Rio marked yet another U-turn for Littlewoods. In 1996 a \u00a31m report from management consultancy Bain &amp; Co urged Littlewoods to focus on its catalogues, keep the profitable football pools and sell off the 135 department stores. </p> <p>This plan, also overseen by Ross, quickly fell apart. In July 1997 Littlewoods scrapped the stores sale after bids failed to top \u00a3600m. Instead, just 19 were offloaded to Marks &amp; Spencer for \u00a3192m to satisfy the family's demands for cash. A \u00a3395m bid for catalogue rival Freemans also fell foul of competition watchdogs. </p> <p>Project Rio, however, also quickly ran into trouble. Home shopping has always been Littlewoods' main driver but, following disagreements with Gibson, most of the division's top manage ment walked out. High-profile departures in the last two years have included catalogues boss Bryan Mayoh and key Index shops executives Bob Lancaster, Francis Armelin and John Allen. </p> <p>Instead of looking outside, staff from the struggling department stores filled the void. One source close to Littlewoods said: 'The chain stores people got the key positions. It was like German reunification but with the East Germans left in charge.' </p> <p>Last year home shopping profits slumped by a third to \u00a365m and - after a poor reception, too, for Littlewoods spring/summer range - sales are still suffering badly across the group. </p> <p>According to insiders, home shopping's problems have been exacerbated by a catalogue of errors at Littlewoods' huge new \u00a350m, fully automated distribution centre at Shaw, near Oldham. This aimed to cut costs by replacing five smaller centres. Two closed depots, however, have now reopened to shift stock from Shaw. And recently it has taken more than a week to fulfil catalogue orders instead of the pledged 48 hours, insiders say. </p> <p>'Shaw is stuffed full of items it can't cope with,' one source said. 'When your warehouse gets choked, costs rise as you madly move stuff around. Then you can't find things, so orders are late, customers return more things and go and shop elsewhere.' </p> <p>This weekend Gibson said Shaw's problems had been resolved by mid-August - week 15 of Littlewoods' financial year. 'We had a four-week hiatus in July,' he said. 'Normal standards were resumed by the second week of August. We aim for 95 per cent of orders in 48 hours and that was achieved.' </p> <p>But that is not the story told by recent figures leaked to The Observer . According to minutes of the group's trading committee on 30 August - for week 17 - Shaw still had stocking problems, and service levels were just 85 per cent, with only 'modest improvement' anticipated. </p> <p>Moreover, 'sales deteriorated across all core businesses' and 'were 24 per cent below budget, exacerbated by a high level of returns'. Littlewoods' store sales were 10 per cent below budget and Index store sales 13 per cent below budget. </p> <p>In home shopping, demand through Littlewoods catalogues was 'extremely disappointing, with turnover [before adjustments] 34 per cent below last year and 30 per cent below budget'. Index Extra had turnover 30 per cent below last year, 30 per cent below budget and 19 per cent below forecast. </p> <p>Retail sources say those problems will not be fixed in time for the crucial Christmas trading season. </p> <p>No wonder, then, that Gibson resorted to some unconventional motivation at the Philharmonic last week. This year the three store managers who best meet targets will win a BMW. </p> <p>'This really is desperation stuff,' one insider said. 'In 1982, when Sir John Moores made redundancies for the first time, he gave up his Rolls Royce and people in Littlewoods felt sorry for him. Now staff would happily set fire to both Barry Gibson and his chauffeur-driven car.' </p> <p><strong> Musical chairs at the hottest seat in UK retailing</strong></p> <p>Britain's biggest privately owned business has its origins in the country's first football pools operation, founded by the late Sir John Moores in 1923. Nine years later, with his brother Cecil, he launched the first Littlewoods catalogue using the football pools' vast mailing list. In 1937 the first Littlewoods department stores opened in Blackpool. </p> <p>By the Seventies the chain was flagging. Moores was Merseyside's biggest post-war benefactor, pumping millions into soccer, the arts and education, but he was also a domineering autocrat whose second son, Peter, was pushed aside as chairman for failing to live up to his exacting standards. </p> <p>In the Eighties he finally brought in professional outside management to run the empire - and then the fun started. Gibson is just the latest in a line of colourful chief executives to take the hottest seat in British retailing. The first, in 1983, was the flamboyant Sir Desmond Pitcher, a consummate soother of Moores family worries. </p> <p>In 1993 he was followed by Barry Dale, a former finance chief at London Transport, who was sacked two years later and responded with an audacious \u00a31.2 billion bid for the Moores empire. Dale was sent packing, but the affair brought to a head tensions within the family. Until his death in 1993 Moores had kept them on a tight leash. Dissent meant disinheritance and the idea of a stock market flotation was taboo. But by now there were 32 family shareholders, many with expensive tastes, notably grandson John III, who had decamped for the playboy lifestyle in Monaco. </p> <p>Dale's departure followed a controversy involving his deputy, Prodip Guha, who was also fired, a Far East supplier - Lorad - and claims that Littlewoods had been ripped off to the tune of \u00a315m.

      "bodyText": "'We're mad!' Barry Gibson, chief executive of Littlewoods, boomed on the stage of Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall. 'We're going to Make A Difference,' he exhorted 900 senior staff gathered for the catalogue and stores group's annual management conference last Wednesday. The occasion launched Littlewood's latest survival strategy - 'better value retailing' - to take on clothes discounters such as Matalan, New Look and Peacocks, which have hit its high street sales hard. But this year's was no happy-clappy event. With up to 300 job cuts already announced this month and heads starting to roll this week, morale among Littlewoods' staff is at rock-bottom. And, increasingly among senior Littlewoods' insiders and certain members of the controlling Moores family, Gibson and his chairman James Ross are seen as part of the problem, not the solution. 'Everyone is in jitters. It's a bloody mess,' one family member told The Observer last week. 'If I could, I'd change the board and change direction. We need to get profits up, but we also need to raise morale urgently.' Littlewoods has seen its share of ructions in the last decade, as the business has struggled to keep up. But its present straits leave the group in its worst predicament yet, say senior insiders and retail industry figures. The problems, they say, stem directly from key decisions taken since Gibson's appointment three years ago. 'Making a difference' is just one of a plethora of initiatives launched by the 48-year-old chief executive, who joined from airports group BAA but began his working life as a Littlewoods management trainee in 1970. In quickfire succession, the 27,000 staff have also been left bewildered by 'back on track', 'changing with pride', 'Project Concorde' and 'Operation Spaceship' - the latter a \u00a310 million brainwave that carved up Littlewoods' 14-storey Liverpool headquarters into open-plan offices 'with ambience'. 'Following on from the success of \"changing with pride\" and \"building on pride\" we now bring you \"consolidating with hubris\",' the firm's underground newsletter Then sniped in the summer, adding: 'You could say that means \"harsh unemployment begets a reduction in insolent sods\".' The publication is a spoof of the official staff magazine Now . According to senior retail sources, Littlewoods' core problems can be traced to the biggest overhaul of all - 'Project Rio' (retail integration operation). Begun 18 months ago, it aims to cut \u00a350m of annual costs by consolidating all activities - the department stores, Index catalogue shops and home shopping - as a single trading operation under the Littlewoods name. 'Barry believed there were massive savings to be made by reinventing the brand name for everything,' one senior source said. 'The problem is that stores and mail order are completely different, with different customers, stock and credit control demands.' Conceived by Gibson shortly after his appointment, Rio marked yet another U-turn for Littlewoods. In 1996 a \u00a31m report from management consultancy Bain &amp; Co urged Littlewoods to focus on its catalogues, keep the profitable football pools and sell off the 135 department stores. This plan, also overseen by Ross, quickly fell apart. In July 1997 Littlewoods scrapped the stores sale after bids failed to top \u00a3600m. Instead, just 19 were offloaded to Marks &amp; Spencer for \u00a3192m to satisfy the family's demands for cash. A \u00a3395m bid for catalogue rival Freemans also fell foul of competition watchdogs. Project Rio, however, also quickly ran into trouble. Home shopping has always been Littlewoods' main driver but, following disagreements with Gibson, most of the division's top manage ment walked out. High-profile departures in the last two years have included catalogues boss Bryan Mayoh and key Index shops executives Bob Lancaster, Francis Armelin and John Allen. Instead of looking outside, staff from the struggling department stores filled the void. One source close to Littlewoods said: 'The chain stores people got the key positions. It was like German reunification but with the East Germans left in charge.' Last year home shopping profits slumped by a third to \u00a365m and - after a poor reception, too, for Littlewoods spring/summer range - sales are still suffering badly across the group. According to insiders, home shopping's problems have been exacerbated by a catalogue of errors at Littlewoods' huge new \u00a350m, fully automated distribution centre at Shaw, near Oldham. This aimed to cut costs by replacing five smaller centres. Two closed depots, however, have now reopened to shift stock from Shaw. And recently it has taken more than a week to fulfil catalogue orders instead of the pledged 48 hours, insiders say. 'Shaw is stuffed full of items it can't cope with,' one source said. 'When your warehouse gets choked, costs rise as you madly move stuff around. Then you can't find things, so orders are late, customers return more things and go and shop elsewhere.' This weekend Gibson said Shaw's problems had been resolved by mid-August - week 15 of Littlewoods' financial year. 'We had a four-week hiatus in July,' he said. 'Normal standards were resumed by the second week of August. We aim for 95 per cent of orders in 48 hours and that was achieved.' But that is not the story told by recent figures leaked to The Observer . According to minutes of the group's trading committee on 30 August - for week 17 - Shaw still had stocking problems, and service levels were just 85 per cent, with only 'modest improvement' anticipated. Moreover, 'sales deteriorated across all core businesses' and 'were 24 per cent below budget, exacerbated by a high level of returns'. Littlewoods' store sales were 10 per cent below budget and Index store sales 13 per cent below budget. In home shopping, demand through Littlewoods catalogues was 'extremely disappointing, with turnover [before adjustments] 34 per cent below last year and 30 per cent below budget'. Index Extra had turnover 30 per cent below last year, 30 per cent below budget and 19 per cent below forecast. Retail sources say those problems will not be fixed in time for the crucial Christmas trading season. No wonder, then, that Gibson resorted to some unconventional motivation at the Philharmonic last week. This year the three store managers who best meet targets will win a BMW. 'This really is desperation stuff,' one insider said. 'In 1982, when Sir John Moores made redundancies for the first time, he gave up his Rolls Royce and people in Littlewoods felt sorry for him. Now staff would happily set fire to both Barry Gibson and his chauffeur-driven car.' Musical chairs at the hottest seat in UK retailing Britain's biggest privately owned business has its origins in the country's first football pools operation, founded by the late Sir John Moores in 1923. Nine years later, with his brother Cecil, he launched the first Littlewoods catalogue using the football pools' vast mailing list. In 1937 the first Littlewoods department stores opened in Blackpool. By the Seventies the chain was flagging. Moores was Merseyside's biggest post-war benefactor, pumping millions into soccer, the arts and education, but he was also a domineering autocrat whose second son, Peter, was pushed aside as chairman for failing to live up to his exacting standards. In the Eighties he finally brought in professional outside management to run the empire - and then the fun started. Gibson is just the latest in a line of colourful chief executives to take the hottest seat in British retailing. The first, in 1983, was the flamboyant Sir Desmond Pitcher, a consummate soother of Moores family worries. In 1993 he was followed by Barry Dale, a former finance chief at London Transport, who was sacked two years later and responded with an audacious \u00a31.2 billion bid for the Moores empire. Dale was sent packing, but the affair brought to a head tensions within the family. Until his death in 1993 Moores had kept them on a tight leash. Dissent meant disinheritance and the idea of a stock market flotation was taboo. But by now there were 32 family shareholders, many with expensive tastes, notably grandson John III, who had decamped for the playboy lifestyle in Monaco. Dale's departure followed a controversy involving his deputy, Prodip Guha, who was also fired, a Far East supplier - Lorad - and claims that Littlewoods had been ripped off to the tune of \u00a315m. All the allegations were denied and Littlewoods later settled with Dale, Guha and Lorad's founders. But the family, who had private detectives running around the globe, felt ripped off and the Moores grandchildren pushed the flotation issue to the fore. In 1996, with the appointment of former Cable &amp; Wireless boss James Ross as chairman, the family agreed a 'new governance' charter. Moores' two children, John Jnr and Lady Grantchester, left the board, leaving only her son, James Suenson Taylor, as a family director. It is the founders' grandchildren who are most eager to cash in and, since Gibson's appointment in 1997, they have been banking on a flotation by the end of 2002 at the latest. paul.farrelly@observer.co.uk",

The UK government has a chance to adopt the directive with public fanfare at an EU Council of Ministers meeting in November. Monks promises a fundamental change in the unions' relationship with Labour if there is no agreement. Again the CBI is worried: it claims that such proposals amount to employees deciding company strategy. If Monks were proposing laws to put union members on company boards there might be a point. But he is not. Monks is cautious - some say too cautious. 'Fairness at Work 2' is pragmatic: not immoderate or impractical. Of course, ministers don't have to listen and they can take solace in the welcome emphasis these days on partnership, not strife. After all, it's inconceivable that the unions would follow the bosses back to the picket lines. Isn't it?",

McBurney, who also gave this year's evangelical Proms lecture on Shostakovich, came across the rough sketches two years ago.

He jacked up the excitement in a riveting performance by hanging on to high notes justa jot longer than musically necessary, eliciting audience whoops mid-aria.

      "body": "<p>It's a rainy Wednesday night in Glasgow. In a poky club behind Mr Chippy in Sauchiehall Street, Teenage Fanclub clamber on stage. The group look hesitant. Homecoming gigs can be tumultuous affairs. Their mini-set is being filmed for BBC TV's pop show The Beat Room. A woman barks orders at the crowd. 'Ye have to clap when we introduce them,' she says. She wanders off to the bar with a cameraman in tow. The group shift uneasily. </p> <p>Teenage Fanclub were once kings of the Scottish music scene. Back in 1991, the group's Bandwagonesque LP ensured their reputation as Glasgow's leading songwriters. Raymond McGinley, Norman Blake and Gerard Love were the musical heirs of the Beach Boys and the Byrds. After the white wine cocktail jazz of Hue &amp; Cry, and Wet Wet Wet's anaemic Northern Soul, Teenage Fanclub's dorm-room pop resurrected the city's music scene. With their lovelorn lyrics and sweet guitar melodies, they were the forerunners for Travis, a band with half their talent but more than twice their sales. </p> <p>The Grand Prix album of 1995 was a creative zenith, a gloriously sullen record buoyed by the group's distinctive three-part harmonies. The 13 songs - any of which would have made a great hit single - are a recording milestone of their old label, Creation. But Songs From Northern Britain in 1997 plunged the group into ignominy - a collection that hinted at a musical block. </p> <p> Howdy! , out next month, underlines their reputation as the leading quirky songwriters of their era. Those rainbow voices still underpinned by maudlin lyrics - 'My life feels so worthwhile/ When I go where you send me/ When I can't find a smile/ You've got one to lend me.' Britpop, substituting compassion for stadium excesses, would have been better redrawn in Teenage Fanclub's image. </p> <p>Live, the new songs are full of forlorn dedications to women tolerant of their moody menfolk, delivered in engagingly unprofessional style. One verse into the group's latest single, the mournful 'I Need Direction', McGinley pauses. 'Sorry about that - it's a complicated wee jazz chord.' </p> <p>The show is a heartening reminder of their songwriting abilities and Howdy! deserves a nomination for next year's Mercury Music Prize. Afterwards, backstage, McGinley, Blake and Love sit nursing beers. 'Ye cannae tell with these TV shows,' says Love. 'I was trying to concentrate on the songs, but there was this cameraman hovering around that I felt I was going to bump into.' </p> <p>After the show, Blake walks across Sauchiehall Street to a bar called Nice 'N' Sleazy. In the early Nineties it was, alongside The Cathouse, the sole Glaswegian haunt of metal-kids and goths after a night out at the university Union. While The Cathouse premiered US metal groups like Poison and Ministry, Nice 'N' Sleazy could only afford their British equivalents: the Almighty, Dogs D'Amour, Little Angels. </p> <p>The club, like most of central Glasgow, has been refurbished to a cosmopolitan homogeneity. 'Yeah, this was a rock club,' says Blake. He looks at the clientele: designer denims and hipster pants, their owners squeezed into Fifties-style booths. 'To be honest, I don't get out that often these days,' he says. 'When there's kids to consider, you just don't get the chance. But yeah, this place has changed.' </p> <p>Blake and his bandmates move further down the bar, edging closer to their friends. Pints are waved and the group laugh as local well-wishers congratulate them on their performance. Throughout the evening, Blake, McGinley and Love circle friends and sheepishly accept compliments, politely replying 'cheers' and 'ta'. </p> <p>As I stagger back from the lavatory, I pass Blake, who stands chatting to a friend. 'This is Eugene from Eugenius,' he says, grabbing my arm. Back in 1992, the year grunge broke, Eugenius were hotly tipped by Nirvana. But the group failed to capitalise on their plaudits, and have since resigned themselves to the independent sector. 'You're the best,' says Blake. 'This is the man,' says Eugene, pointing at Blake. They smile, hug, and order vodkas. </p> <p>Next morning, I sit in Fazzi's, an Italian delicatessen, waiting for the group to arrive. McGinley and Blake amble in a little past 11, both nursing hangovers. Love arrives last. The previous evening, he wandered off to a club night at The 13th Note. Wednesday night holds the club's Death Metal disco. 'It was called Deathlehem,' he giggles. 'I'm no kidding, there were only around 50 kids all in black, throwing themselves against the walls. And the music? All grunts and groans. At one point the DJ played some AC/DC - it sounded like someone had just thrown Abba on.' </p> <p>Seated around the table, the group look nervously at my Dictaphone. Not that they mind talking. All three have wonderful, comic reminiscences of Glasgow and further afield. But the anecdotes disguise their unease with talking about their own material. </p> <p>Love points to the window - insistent winds and light rains. 'The Glaswegian climate has a lot to do with who we are,' he says. </p> <p>'It can be quite depressing. I used to look out my windows a lot and it was always raining. After a while, that starts to affect your outlook on life.' </p> <p>I mention 'My Uptight Life', an outstanding track on the new album. It fades with a repetitive line strummed over acoustic guitars: 'All my life/ I've felt so uptight/ Now it's all alright.' It hints darkly at a Scottish masculine neurosis drowned in stoicism and alcohol. </p> <p>'I don't know why I wrote that,' says McGinley. He shifts uncomfortably in his seat, ears flushed. </p> <p>Directing his conversation at the table before him, he says: 'I guess everything is autobiographical to a certain extent: the words just seem to make sense at the time. You pluck them out of somewhere in your consciousness.' </p> <p>He looks embarrassed. 'I guess I was trying to get across this idea that I can often feel alienated from everything,' he says, carefully. Both Love and Blake nod, but say nothing. 'It's difficult to explain, but you have these nagging doubts. I'm not talking about music; I mean human doubts. Doubts about the kind of man you have become.' </p> <p>Love and Blake look on in relief and McGinley pours a glass of water down his throat. They're happier talking about their quirky stories - nights out in Glasgow, 'Mad Tom', who once stabbed a hunchback with an ornamental sword. We laugh for hours. </p> <p>A little past three, Blake, McGinley and Love walk across the street, waving polite goodbyes. I watch them scurrying towards their cars and think about them in their flats, gazing out at the rain. </p> <p>\u0095 'I Need Direction' is released on 9 October; Howdy! on 23 October</p>",

Homecoming gigs can be tumultuous affairs. Their mini-set is being filmed for BBC TV's pop show The Beat Room. A woman barks orders at the crowd. 'Ye have to clap when we introduce them,' she says. She wanders off to the bar with a cameraman in tow. The group shift uneasily. Teenage Fanclub were once kings of the Scottish music scene. Back in 1991, the group's Bandwagonesque LP ensured their reputation as Glasgow's leading songwriters. Raymond McGinley, Norman Blake and Gerard Love were the musical heirs of the Beach Boys and the Byrds. After the white wine cocktail jazz of Hue &amp; Cry, and Wet Wet Wet's anaemic Northern Soul, Teenage Fanclub's dorm-room pop resurrected the city's music scene. With their lovelorn lyrics and sweet guitar melodies, they were the forerunners for Travis, a band with half their talent but more than twice their sales. The Grand Prix album of 1995 was a creative zenith, a gloriously sullen record buoyed by the group's distinctive three-part harmonies. The 13 songs - any of which would have made a great hit single - are a recording milestone of their old label, Creation. But Songs From Northern Britain in 1997 plunged the group into ignominy - a collection that hinted at a musical block. Howdy! , out next month, underlines their reputation as the leading quirky songwriters of their era. Those rainbow voices still underpinned by maudlin lyrics - 'My life feels so worthwhile/ When I go where you send me/ When I can't find a smile/ You've got one to lend me.' Britpop, substituting compassion for stadium excesses, would have been better redrawn in Teenage Fanclub's image. Live, the new songs are full of forlorn dedications to women tolerant of their moody menfolk, delivered in engagingly unprofessional style. One verse into the group's latest single, the mournful 'I Need Direction', McGinley pauses. 'Sorry about that - it's a complicated wee jazz chord.' The show is a heartening reminder of their songwriting abilities and Howdy! deserves a nomination for next year's Mercury Music Prize. Afterwards, backstage, McGinley, Blake and Love sit nursing beers. 'Ye cannae tell with these TV shows,' says Love. 'I was trying to concentrate on the songs, but there was this cameraman hovering around that I felt I was going to bump into.' After the show, Blake walks across Sauchiehall Street to a bar called Nice 'N' Sleazy. In the early Nineties it was, alongside The Cathouse, the sole Glaswegian haunt of metal-kids and goths after a night out at the university Union. While The Cathouse premiered US metal groups like Poison and Ministry, Nice 'N' Sleazy could only afford their British equivalents: the Almighty, Dogs D'Amour, Little Angels. The club, like most of central Glasgow, has been refurbished to a cosmopolitan homogeneity. 'Yeah, this was a rock club,' says Blake. He looks at the clientele: designer denims and hipster pants, their owners squeezed into Fifties-style booths. 'To be honest, I don't get out that often these days,' he says. 'When there's kids to consider, you just don't get the chance. But yeah, this place has changed.' Blake and his bandmates move further down the bar, edging closer to their friends. Pints are waved and the group laugh as local well-wishers congratulate them on their performance. Throughout the evening, Blake, McGinley and Love circle friends and sheepishly accept compliments, politely replying 'cheers' and 'ta'. As I stagger back from the lavatory, I pass Blake, who stands chatting to a friend. 'This is Eugene from Eugenius,' he says, grabbing my arm. Back in 1992, the year grunge broke, Eugenius were hotly tipped by Nirvana. But the group failed to capitalise on their plaudits, and have since resigned themselves to the independent sector. 'You're the best,' says Blake. 'This is the man,' says Eugene, pointing at Blake. They smile, hug, and order vodkas. Next morning, I sit in Fazzi's, an Italian delicatessen, waiting for the group to arrive. McGinley and Blake amble in a little past 11, both nursing hangovers. Love arrives last. The previous evening, he wandered off to a club night at The 13th Note. Wednesday night holds the club's Death Metal disco. 'It was called Deathlehem,' he giggles. 'I'm no kidding, there were only around 50 kids all in black, throwing themselves against the walls. And the music? All grunts and groans. At one point the DJ played some AC/DC - it sounded like someone had just thrown Abba on.' Seated around the table, the group look nervously at my Dictaphone. Not that they mind talking. All three have wonderful, comic reminiscences of Glasgow and further afield. But the anecdotes disguise their unease with talking about their own material. Love points to the window - insistent winds and light rains. 'The Glaswegian climate has a lot to do with who we are,' he says. 'It can be quite depressing. I used to look out my windows a lot and it was always raining. After a while, that starts to affect your outlook on life.' I mention 'My Uptight Life', an outstanding track on the new album. It fades with a repetitive line strummed over acoustic guitars: 'All my life/ I've felt so uptight/ Now it's all alright.' It hints darkly at a Scottish masculine neurosis drowned in stoicism and alcohol. 'I don't know why I wrote that,' says McGinley. He shifts uncomfortably in his seat, ears flushed. Directing his conversation at the table before him, he says: 'I guess everything is autobiographical to a certain extent: the words just seem to make sense at the time. You pluck them out of somewhere in your consciousness.' He looks embarrassed. 'I guess I was trying to get across this idea that I can often feel alienated from everything,' he says, carefully. Both Love and Blake nod, but say nothing. 'It's difficult to explain, but you have these nagging doubts. I'm not talking about music; I mean human doubts. Doubts about the kind of man you have become.' Love and Blake look on in relief and McGinley pours a glass of water down his throat. They're happier talking about their quirky stories - nights out in Glasgow, 'Mad Tom', who once stabbed a hunchback with an ornamental sword. We laugh for hours. A little past three, Blake, McGinley and Love walk across the street, waving polite goodbyes. I watch them scurrying towards their cars and think about them in their flats, gazing out at the rain. \u0095 'I Need Direction' is released on 9 October; Howdy! on 23 October",

      "body": "<p><strong> Castaway 2000</strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Big Brother</strong> C4 </p> <p><strong> Jailbreak</strong> C5 </p> <p><strong> Other People's Children </strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> The Olympic Games Opening Ceremony</strong> BBC1 </p> <p>You will remember that as recently as last spring, the castaways on Taransay were such a seductive television proposition that due to overwhelming public demand we were treated to a swiftly scheduled week of nightly updates. </p> <p>This week, we returned to Taransay a more sophisticated and jaded viewing nation. Suddenly, titillation by turnip-planting isn't quite enough (the ground is very acidic, apparently, and therefore good for root vegetables), and even though the islanders have all gone pagan-shaped (a diet of root vegetables will do that to you) - burning a wicker man in the image of the ejected dissident islander, Ray, and dancing around maypoles - there is clearly a great deal of depressingly modern backstabbing, bitching, stamping of feet, door-slamming and the mass chucking of teddies out of metaphorical cots. </p> <p>Everybody is the same, but more so. The formerly charming Ben Fogle seems to have lost some of his sheen and (unthinkable just a few months ago) developed an unattractive poor-me whine; Ron the psychotherapist is proving to be disruptive rather than merely maverick; the super-smug Dr Roger is now both metasmug and enthusiastically manipulative; while almost everybody else is obsessed with their rations of snouts and Tropicana orange juice, chocolate buttons and whisky. </p> <p>The whole environment has developed that grubby, misanthropic air of bitter hippydom, just like all those post-Altamont Sixties drop-out communal dreams turned sour. But worse than this, unfamiliarity has managed to breed viewer contempt. This week, we were watching events filmed as long ago as May, and in the Big Brother era that's just not fast enough. In the space of a few short months, <strong> Castaway 2000</strong> now looks like time-lapsed, old-fashioned docusoap 'reality TV'. Who would have thought it? </p> <p>Meanwhile, the final days inside the <strong> Big Brother</strong> house saw a kind of semi-competitive ennui, and nights revealed that the three remaining housemates were so bored by each other's company (and their own) that it was invariably - yawn - lights out by 10. There were some last-minute, vote-grabbing tactics to be seen in the task of caring for Juanita, the spooky 'baby simulator'. </p> <p>Father-of-three Darren looked the most convincing, but that may have been because Juanita matched his skin tone. Craig gave a good impression of a man keen to embrace fatherhood and thus win over any wavering female voters ('I really respect all those single mothers out there, looking after those little babies!' Oh give it a rest Craig!), but Anna won on points merely by using the 'breastfeeding' device. Happily, nobody tried to smother little Juanita or leave her overnight in the chicken coop, even though we could have done with some controversy. </p> <p>Though Craig had a strong lead at the polls all week, I was still rooting for Anna right up until Thursday, at which point she let her fans down rather badly when, given the opportunity to select a favourite song to be played by Big Brother, she revealed an aspect of her personality we really didn't need to know. </p> <p>Out of all the songs in the world , she inexplicably selected, without a trace of irony (indeed, she got a bit moist of eye), a truly dreadful piece of 1980s electro-pap, 'Electric Dreams' by Phil Oakey and Giorgio Moroder, thus pretty much throwing away the previous nine weeks of carefully-cultivated credibility. Darren's choice, meanwhile, was a transparently vote-grabbing dance track favoured by his kids, while Craig sang along (badly) to Rod Stewart, at which point one suspected it was all over bar the ticker-tape parades in Liverpool. </p> <p>So as Big Brother settled down, Channel 5's big new reality gameshow, <strong> Jailbreak</strong> , kicked in. Having lost a heavily-pregnant Ulrika Jonsson as presenter at the last minute, the job fell to Craig Charles, who perhaps lacks the requisite va-va-voom factor. Admittedly, it's early days, but Jailbre ak looks like a confusing mess. The great success of Big Brother has been the fact that, weekly tasks aside, the contestants have had to make their own entertainment, and so we swiftly got to know the individual characters and see how the group dynamic was evolving. </p> <p>Like BB , Jailbreak also features 10 contestants, this time competing to escape from a purpose-built jail constructed by 'the UK's leading prison architects'. But there is also a confusingly large supporting cast of slightly too sadistically real (though presumably resting) screws and a genuine governor, Jim Heyes, whose CV includes a clutch of Great Train Robbers, a Kray, 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and the Gartree prison riot of the Seventies, plus two roving reporters in the form of Charlie Stayt and Ruth England. </p> <p>With all this lot competing for screen-time so far, there's been little opportunity to get to know the con testants, despite the pre-filmed inserts: 'Hi! My name is Laura and I'm an office manager and glamour model.' Cue footage of Laura writhing in her smalls but, strangely, none at all of her ordering in the office stationery. </p> <p>It looks like a very daunting task to escape from the jail. It also looks unlikely to be achieved by one person working on their own. And, though doubtless accounting for a lot of the hits on the website, it appears spectacularly unlikely to be managed by Laura (in tears, for some reason, on day one: 'So, so sweet, but a little bit out of her depth,' explained formidable ex-RAF drill instructor Jenny) or the glamorous granny, Pat, who is rather distracted by having left her Carmen rollers at home. Keep 'em all locked up, I say, and throw away the key.

      "bodyText": "Castaway 2000 BBC1 Big Brother C4 Jailbreak C5 Other People's Children BBC1 The Olympic Games Opening Ceremony BBC1 You will remember that as recently as last spring, the castaways on Taransay were such a seductive television proposition that due to overwhelming public demand we were treated to a swiftly scheduled week of nightly updates. This week, we returned to Taransay a more sophisticated and jaded viewing nation. Suddenly, titillation by turnip-planting isn't quite enough (the ground is very acidic, apparently, and therefore good for root vegetables), and even though the islanders have all gone pagan-shaped (a diet of root vegetables will do that to you) - burning a wicker man in the image of the ejected dissident islander, Ray, and dancing around maypoles - there is clearly a great deal of depressingly modern backstabbing, bitching, stamping of feet, door-slamming and the mass chucking of teddies out of metaphorical cots. Everybody is the same, but more so. The formerly charming Ben Fogle seems to have lost some of his sheen and (unthinkable just a few months ago) developed an unattractive poor-me whine; Ron the psychotherapist is proving to be disruptive rather than merely maverick; the super-smug Dr Roger is now both metasmug and enthusiastically manipulative; while almost everybody else is obsessed with their rations of snouts and Tropicana orange juice, chocolate buttons and whisky. The whole environment has developed that grubby, misanthropic air of bitter hippydom, just like all those post-Altamont Sixties drop-out communal dreams turned sour. But worse than this, unfamiliarity has managed to breed viewer contempt. This week, we were watching events filmed as long ago as May, and in the Big Brother era that's just not fast enough. In the space of a few short months, Castaway 2000 now looks like time-lapsed, old-fashioned docusoap 'reality TV'. Who would have thought it? Meanwhile, the final days inside the Big Brother house saw a kind of semi-competitive ennui, and nights revealed that the three remaining housemates were so bored by each other's company (and their own) that it was invariably - yawn - lights out by 10. There were some last-minute, vote-grabbing tactics to be seen in the task of caring for Juanita, the spooky 'baby simulator'. Father-of-three Darren looked the most convincing, but that may have been because Juanita matched his skin tone. Craig gave a good impression of a man keen to embrace fatherhood and thus win over any wavering female voters ('I really respect all those single mothers out there, looking after those little babies!' Oh give it a rest Craig!), but Anna won on points merely by using the 'breastfeeding' device. Happily, nobody tried to smother little Juanita or leave her overnight in the chicken coop, even though we could have done with some controversy. Though Craig had a strong lead at the polls all week, I was still rooting for Anna right up until Thursday, at which point she let her fans down rather badly when, given the opportunity to select a favourite song to be played by Big Brother, she revealed an aspect of her personality we really didn't need to know. Out of all the songs in the world , she inexplicably selected, without a trace of irony (indeed, she got a bit moist of eye), a truly dreadful piece of 1980s electro-pap, 'Electric Dreams' by Phil Oakey and Giorgio Moroder, thus pretty much throwing away the previous nine weeks of carefully-cultivated credibility. Darren's choice, meanwhile, was a transparently vote-grabbing dance track favoured by his kids, while Craig sang along (badly) to Rod Stewart, at which point one suspected it was all over bar the ticker-tape parades in Liverpool. So as Big Brother settled down, Channel 5's big new reality gameshow, Jailbreak , kicked in. Having lost a heavily-pregnant Ulrika Jonsson as presenter at the last minute, the job fell to Craig Charles, who perhaps lacks the requisite va-va-voom factor. Admittedly, it's early days, but Jailbre ak looks like a confusing mess. The great success of Big Brother has been the fact that, weekly tasks aside, the contestants have had to make their own entertainment, and so we swiftly got to know the individual characters and see how the group dynamic was evolving. Like BB , Jailbreak also features 10 contestants, this time competing to escape from a purpose-built jail constructed by 'the UK's leading prison architects'. But there is also a confusingly large supporting cast of slightly too sadistically real (though presumably resting) screws and a genuine governor, Jim Heyes, whose CV includes a clutch of Great Train Robbers, a Kray, 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and the Gartree prison riot of the Seventies, plus two roving reporters in the form of Charlie Stayt and Ruth England. With all this lot competing for screen-time so far, there's been little opportunity to get to know the con testants, despite the pre-filmed inserts: 'Hi! My name is Laura and I'm an office manager and glamour model.' Cue footage of Laura writhing in her smalls but, strangely, none at all of her ordering in the office stationery. It looks like a very daunting task to escape from the jail. It also looks unlikely to be achieved by one person working on their own. And, though doubtless accounting for a lot of the hits on the website, it appears spectacularly unlikely to be managed by Laura (in tears, for some reason, on day one: 'So, so sweet, but a little bit out of her depth,' explained formidable ex-RAF drill instructor Jenny) or the glamorous granny, Pat, who is rather distracted by having left her Carmen rollers at home. Keep 'em all locked up, I say, and throw away the key. Though if Channel 5 can tighten up the direction and editing, I'll probably be completely hooked by this time next week. I'd never read a Joanna Trollope before, but I thought I'd do my homework before viewing Other People's Children . Much to my surprise, there were no Agas in the book, but I think I spotted one on the screen (though, of course, it could have been a Raeburn) and Trollope turned out to be far more clogged-kitchen-sink than pristine-designer-range, so the BBC's adaptation was a very watchable, dirty realist bit of domestic business. Exploring the fallout caused by multiple mar riages, dead parents and the unexpected creation of mutant step-families, it provided Lesley Manville with a peach of a part as Nadine, a freshly divorced mother-of-three on the verge of a partially self-inflicted nervous breakdown. Determined to infect her family with her own bitterness and sense of betrayal after 17 years of marriage, she had relocated the kids to a rundown rural cottage (the home with the recalcitrant range) where they were free to indulge in a rich assortment of rages. Railing convincingly against the unfairness of a life in such reduced circumstances, while also struggling to be a 'good' mother, the scene in which Manville shouted abuse at her kids (and her absent ex), before attempting to coax a smile out of her emotionally bludgeoned brood with promises of 'Hot choccy? Hot choccy-woccy?', will have sent shivers down the spine of anybody who has ever been on the receiving end of a bit of irrational and misguided motherly 'love'. Shivers down the spine, too, at The Olympic Games Opening Ceremony . Sorry, I can't help it, but I love an Olympic opening ceremony - and I think I'd rather watch it on television than be there. How else do you get to see a 'ballet with lawnmowers' and then be told that Australia invented the lawnmower? Or find out that Hungary has more doctors per head of population than any other country on Earth and 'some very pretty ladies, too'? Is there ever going to be another opportunity to watch Rupert Murdoch waving his pair of patriotic green-and-yellow glove puppets (Wendi looked unimpressed), or to get a bit teary when the two Koreas joined forces to carry one flag and the leaderless, smiling East Timorese danced into the stadium under the banner of 'Individual Olympic Athletes'? Yes, for those four-and-a- half pretty hours, it was almost possible to watch thousands of shiny young athletes without being tempted to play Spot the Human Growth Hormones. Almost possible, but I'm sure I spotted a few.",

A young poet and recent convert to Alcoholics Anonymous meets an older man, an ex-communist turned e-millionaire.

The play, which Hare directs himself, doesn't find a language, visual or verbal, which persuades you that it's inhabiting a dot.com world. A framing device in which the young poet addresses the audience directly is awkward, not least because its relation to an Alcoholics Anonymous confessional is never made clear. The dialogue, though often shrewd and humorous, is prone to fits of po-faced explicitness: 'I'm not,' the Ormond character is obliged to insist, 'a stranger to self-hatred.' </p> <p>This play is less sleekly all-of-a-piece than Hare's most recent work, which makes it more interesting.

And it contains a fascinating performance by Julia Ormond who sets the tone of the play's discussions: damped-down desperation masquerading as chic. </p> <p>At the Tricycle, actors from the Jewish State Theatre of Bucharest are performing a drama that puts to shame the flashy posturing of many artistic treatments of Nazi atrocities. <strong> An Die Musik</strong> was created 25 years ago by the director Pip Simmons as a response to what he considered sentimental treatments of the Holocaust. It serves as a les son on how the theatre can convey real-life tragedy. </p> <p>The play has one flaw: its opening half-hour - a wordless operetta based on the diary of Anne Frank - is histrionic. But what follows is grave and hugely powerful. Concentration-camp inmates are ordered by a Nazi officer to produce an entertainment. The group of men and women - sunken-eyed, hollow-cheeked, with arms hanging down like broom-handles in their striped uniforms - are forced through a series of punishing keep-fit drills.

And accompanying themselves raggedly but tunefully on clarinet and recorders, looking frightened, stunned and wild, the company sing the Schubert song that gives the piece its name, a song which speaks of the consoling power of art.

Like the plain white canvas on which the argument between a trio of male friends hinges, the play has turned out to be a space waiting to be given significance by whoever plays in it.

True, his practice was responsible for the Eurostar terminal at Waterloo, but the point there was to do something new, design its glorious, if not entirely gravity-defying sinuous glass roof, a roof that is currently swathed in canvas to protect passengers from falling panes and which is the subject of ongoing litigation. </p> <p>Grimshaw is confident his practice will emerge unscathed. 'We did all that any responsible architect could have done to specify the proper glass for that roof.' The experience of being sued by a client trying to apportion blame for technical shortcomings has not diminished his enthusiasm for always trying to get the most out of materials. 'What I do find trying is the suggestion that if you do anything in a new way as an architect you are taking huge risks.' </p> <p>Grimshaw made his name by being perhaps the most singleminded of all the English high-tech school in the Sixties. While other architects once associated with the style have moved on - Michael Hopkins, for example is happy to build in medieval-looking stone in Dorset, and Norman Foster is getting increasingly interested in experiments with form - Grimshaw has remained comfortable with naked aluminium and the imagery of the jeep, the airship and airstream caravan. </p> <p>It was his determination to stick with only one end of the architectural spectrum that contributed to his break-up with his first professional partner.

He still has all the floppy hair that he wore when he was prowling the streets of Swinging London in flared velvet suits with improbably wide lapels. And he still appears to have the same spectacles, with frames as wide as goggles, in a range of lurid colours. </p> <p>When you ask him about the high-tech label, he shrugs. 'Everybody should be building with the technology of their own age - the Edwardians were very high-tech. It's the way you look at how materials are put together that matters. To me, that is what makes for real architecture as opposed to scenery. Quinlan Terry once said he didn't care what his buildings were made of so long as they looked Georgian. That just the opposite of what I'm about.' </p> <p>Grimshaw claims to be interested in substance more than style. 'I like to think our approach is one you'd get from a good boat builder. It's not the same boat every time but you recognise that it's from the same mind and hands.' It's a seductive idea, but boat builders are not necessarily the first people you would call in to design a house. Grimshaw is good at light, delicate sheds. </p> <p>He has not always been so light on his feet with buildings that require more urbane qualities. The Berlin Stock Exchange looked impressive as a computer model but in the flesh was too heavy-handed for its setting and turns what look like a giant pair of concrete Mickey Mouse shoes to the street. In Camden Town, Grimshaw's supermarket for Sainsbury's squats like a giant piece of machinery amid nineteenth-century terraced streets. And the development's car park presents one almost entirely windowless fa\u00e7ade to the street. </p> <p>So would Grimshaw, with his prejudice toward metal and glass, countenance using low-tech stone, for example, to integrate a design with its context? </p> <p>'Our project to rebuild Bath Spa actually has quite a lot of stone it. We put stone blocks in glass cubes a bit like a Russian stove. It's a very good material for a spa, it's not just a bit of cladding.' </p> <p>But if Grimshaw has shown no inclination to take up with modish new architectural strategies, to judge by the range of his work on show in Equilibrium , an exhibition that opened at the Design Museum last week, he is showing no sign of stagnation or of running out of steam.

      "body": "<p><strong> Gillian Wearing</strong> Serpentine, London W2 to 29 October </p> <p>In 'Drunk' a new video by Gillian Wearing, some street drinkers are going through the motions. They swig, mumble, stagger and shriek, opening their flies against the nearest wall. Aimless quarrels brew into ham-fisted fights, followed by lavish displays of reconciliation. The drinkers regroup, separate and subside into sleep, before the cycle of intimacy and boredom starts over. It could be exactly what you see on so many streets, except that it isn't - not remotely. </p> <p> Drunk is shot in black and white on 16mm film and projected on a vast triptych of nearly contiguous screens. The drinkers appear against the stark white backdrop of a photographic studio and they are conspicuously framed and edited. The first capers across the right-hand screen - Wearing has been looking at Brueghel's rustics - before tumbling out of the frame. Another collapses in the centre and eventually stretches the length of all three screens - a nod to Holbein's Christ in the Tomb . </p> <p>Painting, then, but theatre too - the piece looks like a promenade performance, drinkers lurching in pairs from left to right, forming tableaux, making their entrances and exits. Sometimes the action looks spontaneous, a melodrama generated by drink. Sometimes it seems stage-directed, as when the drinkers pose for the camera and you wonder who bought the booze. Do they know what is going on? How do they come to be here? Are they aware that Wearing is as likely to film them sympathetically as cage them in close-up, comatose and drooling, like animals exposed in a zoo? </p> <p>Authenticity is crucial to Wearing's art - as crucial as overt artifice. Drunk makes an elaborate semi-fiction out of fact, tells a story about the way a spurned community survives - if it does - by recutting the actuality of this one. It's necessary to suppose that these people are genuine drunks - if they're just acting, then this abject dignity is no more than a mime. Yet you long for some sign that the whole thing is a fiction and not the skilful exploitation of drifters so drunk that they're unaware of the broken glass in which they have stumbled. </p> <p>Veracity, intrusion, manipulation - all the old anxieties about television documentary are openly courted by Wearing in Trauma . In this video, running on a television screen in an intimate booth, adults have roughly four minutes to disclose a childhood trauma. They speak of regular beatings, sexual abuse, dreadful misery in orphanages and psychiatric wards. Some of them feel guilt, as if they were somehow to blame, others are angry, nonplussed or forgiving. </p> <p>Wearing works entirely with cameras and knows how their presence distorts. One of the women who answered her ad even speaks of summoning up a suitable trauma for the occasion. All the speakers sound rehearsed and many of them conclude with a moral - as well they might, after contemplating these memories for so many years. But none of this interferes with the power of their testimony: that's achieved by the masks the artist has given them to wear. </p> <p>Television, which prides itself on screening similar disclosures, tends to protect the subjects with concealing shadows. Wearing has supplied masks of children's faces, varying them accord ing to each speaker. A large woman struggles to speak behind a tight girlish oval with arch little brows; a rosy mask fringed by his own grey beard turns another into a garden gnome. Perhaps they chose from the supply themselves. Either way, the masks are an impediment, a perversely bathetic effect. </p> <p>Humanity is commonly described as both the subject and the character of Wearing's work. That is certainly true of Prelude , her poignant commemoration of another street drunk currently showing at Tate Britain. </p> <p>Wearing filmed this handsome woman in slow-mo, giving her strength and dignity the full screen-star treatment and adding only the voice of her twin describing the woman's sudden death. Authenticity and artifice were in perfect balance there. But it's somewhat hit and miss with Wearing's work. </p> <p>I'm not sure, either, that she wants to seem humane. At the Serpentine, pride of place has been given to Sacha and Mum , a video from 1996 now projected on a giant screen. Everything about this piece is unnervingly weird, from its jerky rhythms and irrational violence - Mum repeatedly dashes Sacha's head to the floor - to its falsely cosy title. Clearly acted, as formal as any Noh play and accompanied by alien cries - spooled in reverse, Twin Peaks style - this is a highly artificial scenario. As a work of fiction, it may have roots in the external world, but it comes entirely from Wearing's mind. </p> <p>What goes on in other people's minds is the more usual subject of her work. At the Serpentine, you can see the much-plagiarised photographs of people holding signs inscribed with their inner thoughts - 'I'm Desperate', 'Mary come back'. Wearing must have an instinct for these folks - nobody ever says anything moderate or bland. Or perhaps she just discards those shots. Like a child tentatively prodding a wounded animal to see if it's still alive, her curiosity gravitates towards anguish. </p> <p>At her best, Wearing resolves that swither between the actual and the artful with real ingenuity. In 2 into 1 , she has recorded a mother talking about her 10-year-old twins, and vice-versa, then switched the monologues and had each lip-synch the other's voices. As the words are uttered, the family truths they reveal are unexpectedly corroborated by the body language witnessed on camera. 'Lawrence is gorgeous, I love every inch of him,' declares Lawrence, smirking at his mother's praise and easing back in his chair. Silently, Lawrence's twin grits his teeth alongside. </p> <p>\u0095 Gillian Wearing's exhibition is sponsored by Selfridges &amp; Co in association with The Observer</p>",

Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Christian Bale <br> <strong> The Cell</strong> (110 mins, 18) Directed by Tarsem Singh; starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste <br> <strong> Human Resources</strong> (100 mins, no cert) Directed by Laurent Cantet; starring Jalil Lespert, Jean-Claude Vallod, Chantal Barr </p> <p>More than 78 years have passed since Anne Nichols's play Abie's Irish Rose opened on Broadway to scathing reviews and ran for a record-breaking 2,327 performances. A sentimental, comic version of Romeo and Juliet , it turns on a Methodist minister marrying a Jewish boy to an Irish-American Catholic girl, who then, with the connivance of a priest and a rabbi, pretend to their prejudiced parents that they have married co-religionists. </p> <p>The latest version of this now familiar formula is <strong> Keeping the Faith</strong> , a bright comedy with which the charming Edward Norton makes his directorial debut. </p> <p>Norton himself plays Brian Kilkenny Finn, a Catholic, whose two closest childhood friends are the fellow Catholic Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman), and Jake Schram (Ben Stiller), a Jew. Brian and Jake have grown up to be the hippest priest and the coolest rabbi on Manhattan's Upper West Side, attracting large middle-class congregations with their smart repartee, New Age theology and swinging services. </p> <p>Back into their lives comes childhood sweetheart Anna, now a confident, super-successful, power-dressing businesswoman, and an old rivalry springs up again. </p> <p>It's often very funny, rarely unintelligent, pretty contrived, and at least 30 minutes too long. The stage directions for both senior rabbi Eli Wallach and middle-aged priest Milos Forman probably read, 'Enter gruffly twinkling'. </p> <p>John Singleton has done little of consequence since his impressive debut Boyz N the Hood in 1991. His reputation will not be greatly enhanced by <strong> Shaft</strong> , a much-hyped revival of the tough, libidinous private eye impersonated by Richard Roundtree in a series of blaxploitation thrillers in the early Seventies. </p> <p>Though clumsily plotted, the movie is well enough staged and stars Samuel L. Jackson as the maverick cop John Shaft, who has to keep an eye on bent NYPD colleagues while pursuing a rich, racist murderer (Christian Bale reprising his American Psycho character) and a Hispanic gang boss. </p> <p>Gordon Parks, the first black photographer to work for Life and director of the original Shaft , has a walk-on role in a Harlem bar and with his snow-white moustache looks in great shape at the age of 88. One of the actors playing a Puerto Rican pistolero glories in the name of Fidel Vicioso. </p> <p>The feature debut of a prize-winning director of commercials and music videos, Tarsem Singh's <strong> The Cell</strong> is a flashy SF thriller, a variation on The Silence of the Lambs , in which the FBI have only a few hours to discover the secret whereabouts of a serial killer's latest female victim. </p> <p>Unfortunately the killer has flipped and is in a coma. But using a technique developed at a Californian neurological centre, psychologist Jennifer Lopez enters his mind and finds some strange things there. </p> <p>This idea was used to better effect in Dreamscape (1984), in which Dennis Quaid had the ability to enter other people's dreams and came face to face with an assassin inside the head of the US President. </p> <p>A better, more sober debut than the The Cell , Laurent Cantet's <strong> Human Resources</strong> is a French movie in the Ken Loach style with a largely non-professional cast. Its young hero, Franck, is an idealistic academic high-flier from a Paris university who before graduating returns to his home town for a brief period as a management trainee at the factory where his dad has spent 30 years on the production line. </p> <p>Cantet convincingly shows how Franck tries to straddle the industrial fence and reconcile bosses and workers. </p> <p>But then he's forced to reappraise his own role and his parents' sacrifice when his father is made redundant and there's a strike.

Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Christian Bale The Cell (110 mins, 18) Directed by Tarsem Singh; starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste Human Resources (100 mins, no cert) Directed by Laurent Cantet; starring Jalil Lespert, Jean-Claude Vallod, Chantal Barr More than 78 years have passed since Anne Nichols's play Abie's Irish Rose opened on Broadway to scathing reviews and ran for a record-breaking 2,327 performances. A sentimental, comic version of Romeo and Juliet , it turns on a Methodist minister marrying a Jewish boy to an Irish-American Catholic girl, who then, with the connivance of a priest and a rabbi, pretend to their prejudiced parents that they have married co-religionists. The latest version of this now familiar formula is Keeping the Faith , a bright comedy with which the charming Edward Norton makes his directorial debut. Norton himself plays Brian Kilkenny Finn, a Catholic, whose two closest childhood friends are the fellow Catholic Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman), and Jake Schram (Ben Stiller), a Jew. Brian and Jake have grown up to be the hippest priest and the coolest rabbi on Manhattan's Upper West Side, attracting large middle-class congregations with their smart repartee, New Age theology and swinging services. Back into their lives comes childhood sweetheart Anna, now a confident, super-successful, power-dressing businesswoman, and an old rivalry springs up again. It's often very funny, rarely unintelligent, pretty contrived, and at least 30 minutes too long. The stage directions for both senior rabbi Eli Wallach and middle-aged priest Milos Forman probably read, 'Enter gruffly twinkling'. John Singleton has done little of consequence since his impressive debut Boyz N the Hood in 1991. His reputation will not be greatly enhanced by Shaft , a much-hyped revival of the tough, libidinous private eye impersonated by Richard Roundtree in a series of blaxploitation thrillers in the early Seventies. Though clumsily plotted, the movie is well enough staged and stars Samuel L. Jackson as the maverick cop John Shaft, who has to keep an eye on bent NYPD colleagues while pursuing a rich, racist murderer (Christian Bale reprising his American Psycho character) and a Hispanic gang boss. Gordon Parks, the first black photographer to work for Life and director of the original Shaft , has a walk-on role in a Harlem bar and with his snow-white moustache looks in great shape at the age of 88. One of the actors playing a Puerto Rican pistolero glories in the name of Fidel Vicioso. The feature debut of a prize-winning director of commercials and music videos, Tarsem Singh's The Cell is a flashy SF thriller, a variation on The Silence of the Lambs , in which the FBI have only a few hours to discover the secret whereabouts of a serial killer's latest female victim. Unfortunately the killer has flipped and is in a coma. But using a technique developed at a Californian neurological centre, psychologist Jennifer Lopez enters his mind and finds some strange things there. This idea was used to better effect in Dreamscape (1984), in which Dennis Quaid had the ability to enter other people's dreams and came face to face with an assassin inside the head of the US President. A better, more sober debut than the The Cell , Laurent Cantet's Human Resources is a French movie in the Ken Loach style with a largely non-professional cast. Its young hero, Franck, is an idealistic academic high-flier from a Paris university who before graduating returns to his home town for a brief period as a management trainee at the factory where his dad has spent 30 years on the production line. Cantet convincingly shows how Franck tries to straddle the industrial fence and reconcile bosses and workers. But then he's forced to reappraise his own role and his parents' sacrifice when his father is made redundant and there's a strike. A thoughtful picture that ends glibly.",

How could anyone have admired or been moved by this tedious, banal, incompetent movie? When its writer-director (several of whose films I've admired) was later awarded the Palme d'Or and Bj\u00f6rk named the festival's best actress, I was stunned.

No such luck. The experience begins with five minutes sitting in the dark listening to a portentous sub-Wagnerian overture before grainy images introduce Bj\u00f6rk as Selma, a Czech immigrant in Washington State in the Fifties. She's brought her 12-year-old son to a small town for the operation that will save his eyesight, and herself works overtime to pay for it, exacerbating the congenital condition that is making her prematurely blind. In finding this laughable, I'm reminded of George C. Scott's line as the trainer in Movie Movie who tells the young boxer who's fighting to pay similar hospital bills: 'Your sister's eyes are below the belt.' </p> <p>Selma loves musicals and is rehearsing for an amateur production of The Sound of Music . 'I used to dream I was in a musical because in a musical nothing dreadful happens,' she says in an accent more redolent of the Thames estuary than the Danube basin. However, apart from a few bars of 'My Favourite Things' there isn't a song until the picture's been running some 40 minutes. What we have instead are stilted glimpses of Selma with her best friend (Catherine Deneuve), her devoted suitor (Peter Stormare), her policeman-landlord (David Morse) and fellow employees at the factory where she runs a press making kitchen sinks. </p> <p>The hand-held camera hosepipes around, uncertain whom to observe, and everyone giggles in the embar rassed manner of a home movie. Bj\u00f6rk gives a simpering non-performance; an uncomfortable Deneuve constantly reminds us of Demy's Umbrellas of Cherbourg and how a small-scale musical can be drawn from everyday provincial life. </p> <p>Then comes the first of the movie's seven songs, sung and danced by Bj\u00f6rk and her fellow workers in a frenzied, energetic style. The choreography, by an experienced American Vincent Patterson, brings to mind something embarrassingly spontaneous at Baskin Robbins rather than something carefully contrived by Jerome Robbins; the lyrics (by Bj\u00f6rk, von Trier and Sj\u00f6n Sigurdsson) make the words of their fellow nordic bards Abba sound like Cole Porter at his wittiest. All the songs are prompted by repetitive sounds that Selma hears (not a bad touch) and are fantasies she uses to keep the horrors of everyday life at bay. </p> <p>The worst of those horrors comes when the policeman neighbour steals her savings and provokes her into killing him. 'Why did you kill him?' the vindictive prosecutor asks the blind Selma at the ensuing trial. 'He asked me to,' she replies, repeating a celebrated exchange from Horace McCoy's They Shoot Horses, Don't They? , a tougher, rather more convincing story of a social victim going to the gallows. The trial is not merely the travesty of justice von Trier intends it to be. It evidences as total a disregard for American courtroom procedure as L'Humanit\u00e9 does for the French criminal justice system. But, of course, this isn't supposed to be reality, despite the fact that the movie credits the advice of the Washington State correctional facilities for its staging of the scenes on Death Row.

Miller's Crossing , for instance, is a conflation of Dashiel Hammett's The Glass Key and Red Harvest ; the central character of Barton Fink is based on playwright Clifford Odets and the film's plot derives from Deadline at Dawn , a movie Odets scripted in 1946; their previous film, The Big Lebowski , reworks Chandler's The Big Sleep . </p> <p>Their new movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou? has several sources which are part of the film's meaning. On the surface, it's a picaresque comedy set in the Deep South in 1937 and stars George Clooney, John Tur turro and Tim Blake Nelson as three convicts who escape from a Mississippi chain- gang. Clooney is the charming, loquacious shyster-lawyer Everett, with a Clark Gable moustache and the kind of flat cap and bib-front overalls Henry Fonda wore in The Grapes of Wrath . Turturro is Pete, a surly redneck with a mean streak. Nelson is kind-hearted Delmar, the simple-minded hick. They're a splendid comic trio. </p> <p>Everett has smart-talked them into joining his quest to find the loot he's allegedly buried beneath a shack that will in four days time be submerged to create a dam. His real purpose, however, is to reach his ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter) before she re-marries. </p> <p>Along the way, they meet a black musician and cut a gramophone record at a remote radio station run by a blind manager. This blue-grass song makes them accidental radio stars, and they get involved in the re-election campaign of a corrupt state governor (Charles Durning), who's being challenged by an equally corrupt racist. As photographed by British cinematographer Roger Deakins, the bleached summer landscapes look a treat. </p> <p>But the film announces at the start that it's based on The Odyssey and is prefaced by the opening lines of Robert Fitzgerald's translation: 'Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story of that man skilled in all ways of contending, the wanderer.' </p> <p>Like Joyce's Ulysses , O Brother is a mock epic with a somewhat shorter time span than Homer's, and the classical allusions are fairly jocular. The Clooney character's full name is Ulysses Everett McGill; his wife Penny is, of course, Penelope, and on their journey the convicts meet a variety of Homeric figures. A blind railroad worker warning of trouble with cows is presumably Tiresias; the lotus eaters are Baptists having their past obliterated by full immersion in a swamp; three sirens lure the travellers and appear to destroy Pete; the Cyclops turns up as a massive, one-eyed preacher (John Goodman), who first robs them and is later confronted at a nocturnal Ku Klux Klan rally, a brilliantly choreographed sequence that moves from funny to frightening to fantastic. </p> <p>In addition to Homer, the film wittily invokes twentieth-century American legends. Tommy Johnson, the musician the wanderers play with, is based on Robert Johnson, the black blues composer who allegedly sold his soul to the Devil. While being pursued by the police, they're given a lift by a manic-depressive Baby Face Nelson, the gun-happy gangster who succeeded Dillinger as the FBI's Public Enemy Number One, though in fact (not that this is important) Nelson had been dead three years by 1937. </p> <p>Hovering quietly ready for the film's climax is the epic of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Roosevelt's project to transform the rural South by providing cheap electricity, an event celebrated by grandiose poetic documentaries sponsored by the New Deal. </p> <p>Most significantly, however, the Coens celebrate the ideas and films of the great Preston Sturges, who after a decade writing screenplays emerged as the writer-direc tor of the political satire The Great McGinty in 1940. </p> <p>The surname of their protagonist, McGill, is presumably intended to echo that of Sturges's anti-hero, McGinty, who threw in his lot with crooked politicians the way Clooney does.

      "body": "<b>A year ago my mother left my father for the man she is now going to marry. When she left, my 17-year-old sister, who is two years older than me, stayed in London with my dad. I spend every other weekend with my mum and we talk a lot on the telephone. The problem is that my sister doesn't want to have anything to do with my mum and thinks I should do the same. She keeps saying I am being disloyal to our dad. Dad himself never talks about mum but he did say in the beginning that I should do whatever I felt was right. <p>I feel pulled this way and that and sometimes feel tempted to go and live with my mum. She said I could but I know my sister would never speak to me again. Do you have any ideas how to make life easier for me? </p></b> <p><b> S.D of London</b> </p> <p> I am sorry you are an unhappy and bewildered victim of a family break-up. Your top priority should be to maintain good, affectionate relations with every member of your family. At the same time you should be able to stay wherever you feel most comfortable. When your mother is living with her new husband you may not find her home quite so congenial, but only time will tell, so keep your options open. </p> <p>When a family is fractured as a result of wayward loving, there is a huge sense of betrayal, resentment and, most destructively, of blame on the part of the innocent members. It is much harder to engage than to condemn. But try to understand your mother. </p> <p>Humans are programmed with strong passions which ensure pairing off and producing children. Regrettably those passions don't ever get neatly turned off after the wedding ceremony, and are easily misdirected, so that infidelity even among women is amazingly common, though mostly happens in secret. You may catch a glimpse of how overwhelming your mum's new love must be, that she is prepared to put you through all this misery in order to have her way. Arguably she has been more honest than many, who would go on deceiving their families. I am not justifying her actions, merely trying to explain them. </p> <p>Your attitude is more mature than your sister's and though she may try to push you into an antagonistic position, avoid quarrelling with her. Do not let her force you into acknowledging two camps, them and us. Your father is more traumatised than you, and you should assure him of your loyalty repeatedly, most especially when your mother is married. Affirm that the stepfather will never take his place.

      "bodyText": "A year ago my mother left my father for the man she is now going to marry. When she left, my 17-year-old sister, who is two years older than me, stayed in London with my dad. I spend every other weekend with my mum and we talk a lot on the telephone. The problem is that my sister doesn't want to have anything to do with my mum and thinks I should do the same. She keeps saying I am being disloyal to our dad. Dad himself never talks about mum but he did say in the beginning that I should do whatever I felt was right. I feel pulled this way and that and sometimes feel tempted to go and live with my mum. She said I could but I know my sister would never speak to me again. Do you have any ideas how to make life easier for me? S.D of London I am sorry you are an unhappy and bewildered victim of a family break-up. Your top priority should be to maintain good, affectionate relations with every member of your family. At the same time you should be able to stay wherever you feel most comfortable. When your mother is living with her new husband you may not find her home quite so congenial, but only time will tell, so keep your options open. When a family is fractured as a result of wayward loving, there is a huge sense of betrayal, resentment and, most destructively, of blame on the part of the innocent members. It is much harder to engage than to condemn. But try to understand your mother. Humans are programmed with strong passions which ensure pairing off and producing children. Regrettably those passions don't ever get neatly turned off after the wedding ceremony, and are easily misdirected, so that infidelity even among women is amazingly common, though mostly happens in secret. You may catch a glimpse of how overwhelming your mum's new love must be, that she is prepared to put you through all this misery in order to have her way. Arguably she has been more honest than many, who would go on deceiving their families. I am not justifying her actions, merely trying to explain them. Your attitude is more mature than your sister's and though she may try to push you into an antagonistic position, avoid quarrelling with her. Do not let her force you into acknowledging two camps, them and us. Your father is more traumatised than you, and you should assure him of your loyalty repeatedly, most especially when your mother is married. Affirm that the stepfather will never take his place. In his multiple losses - his life-partner, his integral family, his sense of self-worth - he needs explicit evidence of your love and attachment. If your sister sees you making this effort with him, she will be less prone to condemn. If you can do so without bitter words, discuss your different attitudes, and though her opinions now polarise into black-and-white, maybe she will soften and adopt a more forgiving stance towards your mum. This should make life easier for you. Readers' replies My husband left me for someone else nearly 30 years ago; my son was 17.

      "body": "<p>There's a joke Woody Allen used to tell in his nightclub act. He and his wife were talking about what they should do: go on a holiday or get a divorce. In the end, he says, they decide on the divorce. After all, a holiday is a one-off, but a divorce is something you always have. </p> <p>And there's another old joke, about a couple who eventually separate when they are both in their nineties. What made you do it now, asks the judge in court; after all those years, couldn't you have stuck it out together? 'We wanted to wait until the children died,' they say. And there's a brand new divorce joke now: Jerry Hall says that more parents should put their children first - by leaving each other, just like she and Mick Jagger have done. In an interview last week on ITV's This Morning , she claimed that her children were more content since the pair separated because her new happiness was rubbing off on them. 'I think more people should try it,' she advised - as if she were recommending jogging, or fruit for breakfast. </p> <p>Once divorce was virtually non-existent and marriage often a lifelong prison sentence - especially for women. Even when it was allowed, it was a terrible stigma, and the cost of escape brutally high. Careers were wrecked by it; lives catastrophically overturned. Divorcees were socially excluded - again, especially the women. They became outsiders. It certainly wasn't usually good for the children. I talked to one woman recently whose parents were divorced in the Fifties. She was, she believed then, the only child she knew to come from a broken family, and she never told anyone at all until she left home and went to university where she finally broke down and 'confessed' her shameful past to her boyfriend. It was literally unspeakable: a crime and a sin and a dark secret. Marriage had to be very bleak indeed, to choose a way out that was so grim. </p> <p>You don't have to want to return to the bad old days, where misery raged behind locked doors, to find Jerry Hall's comments jarring. As a spokesperson for Relate wryly said: 'Not every family is the same. If Miss Hall's children are fine, then that is great. But I wouldn't say that applies in every case.' No indeed. For a start, Miss Hall is rich in her own right, and has received a \u00a37 million payout and their house in Richmond, Surrey. The four children have had trust funds set up for them. </p> <p>Most ordinary couples face acute hardship when they divorce - the women in particular, whose finances usually nosedive. And for a woman who has been married to the philandering Mick Jagger to talk about the problem with arguing in front of the children is rather like a woman fleeing a burning house and saying she left because she didn't like the d\u00e9cor. </p> <p>During their long and turbulent relationship, Jagger repeatedly and publicly humiliated her with his infidelities. When tests proved he had fathered a child with a Brazilian model Hall tried to divorce him, but Jagger successfully argued that they weren't legally married anyway. </p> <p>The marriage between Hall and Jagger was a celebrity marriage. When they parted, it was a celebrity separation. We should recognise that celebrities just aren't like us. They might say they are, and be photographed in homey poses, wearing old clothes, talking about takeaways in front of videos and how fame really doesn't mean anything to them. They might want to be 'ordinary', and long for the good old days before the blinding spotlight of stardom, when they knew who they were. And of course, celebrities endure the same unhinging feelings as the rest of us: rage and shame and envy and jealousy and lust and wretchedness and regret and tenderness and love. But they live in a different landscape from the one that most of us inhabit. They have piles of money. They have constant attention. They are flattered and fawned on and seduced (Jerry Hall said that she had to give Jagger 'some specific compensation' because he had been continually propositioned by women desperate to have sex with him, poor man). </p> <p> Recent statistics show that the divorce rates have dropped slightly in the last decade, from 152,633 in 1988 to 145,214 in 1998, but that's only because fewer people are getting married; and those who are, marry later. Divorce is still an epidemic in the Western world. In London, for instance, almost half of marriages end in divorce, and more than 50 per cent of children now live outside of the nuclear family that used to be regarded as normal. But that's nothing compared with the divorce rate among stars. When you read the tabloid papers or pick up the glossy magazines, you could be forgiven for thinking that everyone is thin, beautiful, and getting separated. Take the last few weeks: we read about Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid splitting, Patsy Kensit and Liam Gallagher, Meg Matthews and Noel Gallagher, Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley, Mel B and Jimmy Gulzar (whose vicious bickering about her breast implant and his low sex drive has been spread all over the front pages of the tabloids). In Hollywood, it is extremely uncommon, almost bizarre, for a marriage to endure. </p> <p>And you could be getting the impression that, because a Spice Girl does it, or a model, or an actress, or a footballer; because Liz and Hugh have split, because Patsy Kensit has done it for the third time and oops, there goes Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, then it's OK. It might be heartbreaking (that's good these days, to be emotionally ravaged all over the front of the Sun ), but it's not a failure; it is not something to feel regretful about. No, no, it's a stage and a rite of passage and something that will make you stronger. And not just you - it will be good for the children, as Jerry Hall blithely says. Nobody need suffer. Nobody should feel badly. Things happen. Relationships end. Life hurts. Time heals. Violins play. Another marriage might be round the corner. </p> <p>Next month, a new magazine will be launched called New Era . The title seems accurately to reflect what its contents will be. There will be a celebrity divorcee on every cover; lots of information about how to go about sundering the marriage; hints on how to date again. Above all the message will be 'upbeat' and about moving on to the new era the magazine heralds. 'Divorce is a time for change,' says Lesley Neil, its editor, brightly. 'We intend to approach it in a positive way.' </p> <p>Presumably, it won't be long before couples not only sell their wedding pictures in the way that Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey did to OK! , but also snaps of their split. Ex-couples will be photographed dividing up the silver and bickering over ownership of the CDs. Far from being a stigma in the way that it cruelly used to be, divorce is socially acceptable. Fashionable, even - the endless subject of books and columns in which the divorcee is tragic, stylish, sorrowful, the heroine-victim of a gripping narrative which most of us can enter. </p> <p>In many of these stories of parting, the protagonists are seen as asserting their individuality, being true to themselves, finding themselves after years of self-denial and unspoken misery. What divorce is not allowed to be about is failure. Failure has become unspeakable, the new F-word in our culture. </p> <p> But for most people who go through it, divorce is certainly about failure: the failure of a marriage, and of an idea of the future. Many marriages are like Strindberg's plays or Sartre's hell, where what was once love and desire and affection turns to hate, repulsion, sadism. </p> <p>People scorch each other. Children get caught in the crossfire, the innocent and primary victims. Divorce is almost always ugly, hurtful, scarring, and most people, when they separate, do not do so lightly; far from it. </p> <p>But the new vocabulary of separation that we find in the media, and on the lips of the celebrity-divorcees ('More people should try it') is often light, glib, fake-tragic, feel-good stuff. </p> <p>The columnist Chrissy Iley recently wrote that only unimaginative people were faithful. I'd put it the other way round. It doesn't seem to take much imagination to follow your wayward lusts. To stay faithful is by a long way the harder and more imaginative task. </p> <p>It is also about stoicism, like that line in Rudyard Kipling's great and unjustly mocked poem, 'If': 'If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew/ To serve your turn long after they are gone,/ And so hold on when there is nothing in you/ Except the Will which says to them: \"Hold on!\".' </p> <p>It doesn't sound much fun, does it? Sticking it out; holding on to the old love. But it's probably better for the children. And maybe for us.</p>",

And of course, celebrities endure the same unhinging feelings as the rest of us: rage and shame and envy and jealousy and lust and wretchedness and regret and tenderness and love. But they live in a different landscape from the one that most of us inhabit. They have piles of money. They have constant attention. They are flattered and fawned on and seduced (Jerry Hall said that she had to give Jagger 'some specific compensation' because he had been continually propositioned by women desperate to have sex with him, poor man). Recent statistics show that the divorce rates have dropped slightly in the last decade, from 152,633 in 1988 to 145,214 in 1998, but that's only because fewer people are getting married; and those who are, marry later. Divorce is still an epidemic in the Western world. In London, for instance, almost half of marriages end in divorce, and more than 50 per cent of children now live outside of the nuclear family that used to be regarded as normal. But that's nothing compared with the divorce rate among stars. When you read the tabloid papers or pick up the glossy magazines, you could be forgiven for thinking that everyone is thin, beautiful, and getting separated. Take the last few weeks: we read about Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid splitting, Patsy Kensit and Liam Gallagher, Meg Matthews and Noel Gallagher, Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley, Mel B and Jimmy Gulzar (whose vicious bickering about her breast implant and his low sex drive has been spread all over the front pages of the tabloids). In Hollywood, it is extremely uncommon, almost bizarre, for a marriage to endure. And you could be getting the impression that, because a Spice Girl does it, or a model, or an actress, or a footballer; because Liz and Hugh have split, because Patsy Kensit has done it for the third time and oops, there goes Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, then it's OK. It might be heartbreaking (that's good these days, to be emotionally ravaged all over the front of the Sun ), but it's not a failure; it is not something to feel regretful about. No, no, it's a stage and a rite of passage and something that will make you stronger. And not just you - it will be good for the children, as Jerry Hall blithely says. Nobody need suffer. Nobody should feel badly. Things happen. Relationships end. Life hurts. Time heals. Violins play. Another marriage might be round the corner. Next month, a new magazine will be launched called New Era . The title seems accurately to reflect what its contents will be. There will be a celebrity divorcee on every cover; lots of information about how to go about sundering the marriage; hints on how to date again. Above all the message will be 'upbeat' and about moving on to the new era the magazine heralds. 'Divorce is a time for change,' says Lesley Neil, its editor, brightly. 'We intend to approach it in a positive way.' Presumably, it won't be long before couples not only sell their wedding pictures in the way that Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey did to OK! , but also snaps of their split. Ex-couples will be photographed dividing up the silver and bickering over ownership of the CDs. Far from being a stigma in the way that it cruelly used to be, divorce is socially acceptable. Fashionable, even - the endless subject of books and columns in which the divorcee is tragic, stylish, sorrowful, the heroine-victim of a gripping narrative which most of us can enter. In many of these stories of parting, the protagonists are seen as asserting their individuality, being true to themselves, finding themselves after years of self-denial and unspoken misery. What divorce is not allowed to be about is failure. Failure has become unspeakable, the new F-word in our culture. But for most people who go through it, divorce is certainly about failure: the failure of a marriage, and of an idea of the future. Many marriages are like Strindberg's plays or Sartre's hell, where what was once love and desire and affection turns to hate, repulsion, sadism. People scorch each other. Children get caught in the crossfire, the innocent and primary victims. Divorce is almost always ugly, hurtful, scarring, and most people, when they separate, do not do so lightly; far from it. But the new vocabulary of separation that we find in the media, and on the lips of the celebrity-divorcees ('More people should try it') is often light, glib, fake-tragic, feel-good stuff. The columnist Chrissy Iley recently wrote that only unimaginative people were faithful. I'd put it the other way round. It doesn't seem to take much imagination to follow your wayward lusts. To stay faithful is by a long way the harder and more imaginative task. It is also about stoicism, like that line in Rudyard Kipling's great and unjustly mocked poem, 'If': 'If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew/ To serve your turn long after they are gone,/ And so hold on when there is nothing in you/ Except the Will which says to them: \"Hold on!\".' It doesn't sound much fun, does it? Sticking it out; holding on to the old love. But it's probably better for the children. And maybe for us.",

      "body": "<p>People who have never seen a Chekhov play think they know what they're about to receive. As children's TV comics Trevor and Simon used to intone, 'Mr Gloom is in the room'. Even the Gershwin brothers - sons of St Petersburg \u00e9migr\u00e9s, so they should know - managed to put the boot in: 'With love to lead the way/ I've found more clouds of grey/ Than any Russian play could guarantee.'</p> <p>It's all Stanislavsky's fault. He took one look at The Cherry Orchard and proceeded to direct it as a tragedy. Chekhov was appalled. While writing it he had written to Stanislavsky's wife making it clear that it was 'a comedy, not a drama - even a farce in spots'. Ever since the infamous ensuing row, directors have ricocheted between presenting his masterpiece as a comically absurd dissection of a dying generation unable to face the shock of the new, or the moving tragedy of a bankrupt fin-de-si\u00e8cle family.</p> <p>Truth to tell, it's both - and that's the key to its greatness. First staged in 1904, it is simultaneously a naturalistic portrait of a family and its fortunes, and aprescient drama about social change. The play's unusually rich range of viable interpretations is one reason why it attracts the likes of Trevor Nunn and the Redgraves. That said, none of them has exactly specialised in Chekhov.</p> <p>'For a long time I didn't appreciate him,' admits Vanessa Redgrave in a break from rehearsals for Nunn's production at the National Theatre where he is currently artistic director. 'I couldn't understand why, but I just found it too gentle, too elegiac, too nostalgic. I preferred Ibsen because it was harder and more savage. But when I played Arkadina in The Seagull in 1985 I discovered a capacity I hadn't found in a playwright before, of taking you inside the anatomy of human beings with all their different states of mind, above all into the \"opposites\" which go on inside people.'</p> <p>Such psychological acuity is hardly surprising considering that Chekhov had a day job as a doctor. Yet the strength of the writing - and the reason why actors so love his work - is that he never simply diagnoses or judges his characters. Lesser writers build personalities with characteristics designed to illustrate a position or viewpoint. Chekhov's characters may often symbolise ideas but they also vibrate with contradiction. They are opaque, which makes watching Chekhov an extraordinary act of complicity as we're forced to make our own decisions about his characters, rather than just passively soaking up a rigged argument with pre-ordained goodies and baddies.</p> <p>Vanessa recalls doing Three Sisters with her sister Lynn and Corin's daughter Jemma. 'The director Robert Sturua told us if we didn't make everybody in the audience think of their own lives and what they were doing with them - and maybe feeling quite uncomfortable about that - then we would have failed.' Corin chips in immediately with his recollection of seeing the production in Guildford. 'I came out behind two ladies who'd obviously enjoyed it and one said to the other, \"It's so like life\", and the other retorted, \"I hope not!\"'</p> <p>Brother and sister bat ideas and anecdotes back and forth with more than polite ease, which augurs well as Nunn has indeed cast them as brother and sister. Isn't that dangerously close to being a gimmick? In Chekhov, the truism about there being no small parts is, for once, true. The Cherry Orchard has a cast of 12 named characters, every one of whom could conceive of themselves as the lead at certain moments, and who will have spent at least part of seven rehearsal weeks learning to project family connection.</p> <p>Nunn demurs at the suggestion of sentimental casting. He first worked with Vanessa on Heartbreak House eight years ago and, perhaps encouraged by Shaw's subtitle, 'A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes', suggested they do The Cherry Orchard together. Only now have circumstances and commitments allowed their diaries to coincide. Casting her alongside another member of the clan may have grabbed headlines but Corin and Nunn have been friends since being students together. Most recently, Nunn cast him very effectively in Not About Nightingales , a forgotten Tennessee Williams social drama about a prison riot which Vanessa unearthed and Nunn staged at the National and in New York.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Nunn is alive to potential charges of nepotism which also arise whenever he casts his wife, Imogen Stubbs. 'There's a general sense that it smells wrong,' he observes, a shade ruefully. 'Imogen feels it more than I do, I think. There are two occasions where she's turned down roles with me here for that reason.' Ultimately, however, Nunn regards the sibling element of the Redgrave casting as a bonus. 'It has never come up in rehearsal. We never did improvisations about their real childhood together.'</p> <p>'Casting directors assume too much similarity in families,' observes Corin, warily. Certainly, these two are interdependent but temperamentally miles apart. Rehearsals for No\u00ebl Coward's Song at Twilight in which they played ex-lovers were tempestuous to say the least, one screaming match in particular emptying the room. Even in gentle conversation, their differences are evident. Corin, the 61-year-old younger brother, is naturally circumspect and thoughtful. He leans back, tilting his head to one side, carefully considering his responses. Two years older, Vanessa is more spontaneous and volatile, pouncing on ideas with almost alarming zest. When her energy flags, you can actually see the light go out from behind her eyes.</p> <p>Those characteristics define their acting. Over the last few years, Corin has emerged from behind his sisters' shadows by harnessing his growing physical gravitas to that very quality of careful consideration. The results, in roles as diverse as Roger Casement or Sir Walter in the film of Persuasion , have been seriously powerful. Vanessa's power, on the other hand, springs from her immediacy, which, on film, the camera absolutely laps up. On stage, at her best, there's seemingly no distance between her, the writer's ideas and the audience. She somehow fuses all three elements and transmits pure, inescapable energy.</p> <p><b> SO IT'S ALL</b> the more exciting that Nunn is staging the play in the intimate, 300-seat Cottesloe with no distancing proscenium arch and the audience seated on three sides. It's a ploy he used in his spellbinding RSC production of Three Sisters in the late Seventies. The company toured a three-sided platform for community centres and halls without raked seating. That, in turn, dictated the style. Furniture would have blocked audience sightlines so a famously naturalistic play was staged almost without props, a style which Nunn believes chimed perfectly with the Russian view of Chekhov as primarily a poet.</p> <p>He's revisiting that but with a difference because in The Cherry Orchard physical presence - and absence - are crucially important. Two of the play's most vital characters are never seen - Ranyevskaya's lover in Paris, and her son who drowned - while, conversely, the house and the orchard have enormous significance.</p> <p>That crucial symbolic strain runs in tandem with Chekhov's argument for naturalism. 'In real life,' he wrote, 'people don't spend every minute shooting each other, hanging themselves, making confessions of love. They don't spend all the time saying clever things, they're occupied with eating, drinking, flirting, and talking nonsense. These are the things which ought to be shown on the stage. A play should be written in which people arrive, go away, have dinner, talk about the weather, play cards. Life must be exactly as it is and people as they are.'</p> <p>If The Cherry Orchard were a film it would be classified as an 'inaction movie', but if the activity is mundane, the inconsequential dialogue masks a subtext of conflicting hopes and passions. Furthermore, the big ideas that Chekhov and his characters are handling are as urgent now as ever. 'Chekhov had this constant humanist belief,' says Nunn. 'The characters talk about life \"one hundred years from now\". And here we are. And we too are on the brink of bigger changes than at any time in the last one hundred years. As the student Trofimov says, \"The road's been dug up, you can't go back\".'</p> <p>The Redgraves recently publicly countered attacks on Nunn's stewardship of the National. Nunn isn't there to hear it but, as opening night looms, they reaffirm their confidence. Corin cites Arthur Miller as a defence witness. 'When he was being produced here but not in America, he said: \"By all means criticise the National, criticise the RSC and the Royal Court, but please remember that subsidised theatre is the most important thing you have. Should you ever lose it, you'll realise what you had and it will all be too late\".'</p> <p>To reverse the tide of criticism, Nunn has to encourage more first-rate work throughout the repertoire. Directing a play of this calibre with as strong a cast as this will help, but the strain is beginning to tell. As I leave, he says, 'The one thing we didn't talk about was just what a treat this is. Working on Chekhov is about the best fun you can have in the theatre.' He frowns. 'The trouble is, people have such high expectations_ that's the one thing I don't enjoy.'</p> <p>\u0095 The Cherry Orchard opens at the Cottesloe, London SE1 (020 7452 3000) on Thursday</p>",

Or so you might assume from some reactions to last week's report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which disclosed that a quarter of all Britons are living in poverty. 'Being poor means you can't afford a dinner party,' scoffed one report, conjuring up the vision of a dearth of Krug and roasted quail as the determinant of deprivation. In fact, being able to invite friends or family round, even for baked beans on toast, was low on the survey's list of basic necessities, which included beds, a damp-free home, a warm coat and a dictionary. </p> <p>The final item, the Daily Telegraph implied, might be of benefit to the Rowntree Foundation, accused in the paper's leader column of 'an assault on what words mean'. How dare researchers be 'shocked' at the finding that 17 per cent of British adults believe they are living in 'absolute poverty' as defined by the United Nations? What an insult to the poorest children in the world that citizens of the tenth richest country on the planet should muscle in on their status. </p> <p>Leaving aside the fact that the Telegraph rarely directs its ire towards, say, the fate of Iraqi children condemned to hardship and death by Western sanctions, it is hard to accuse the Rowntree researchers of undue hyperbole. Under their methodology, two million children - or one in six - lack the necessities of life. This is relatively conservative, compared with Unicef's total of 4.5 million or the latest Office of National Statistics estimate of three million, based on a poverty line of less than 60 per cent of median income. But however you stack up the figures, the picture remains similar. </p> <p>On the Rowntree assessment, poverty - as defined both by low income and multiple deprivation - increased by more than a tenth between 1983 and last year. The poor, emphatically, are not the new rich. On the contrary, the rich are the new poor. One of the more surreal aspects of the petrol blockade was the right-wing assertion that the campaign for cheaper fuel was undertaken on behalf of the 'poorest in society'; always a useful totem in times of crisis. Since the poorest do not drive, the only likely winners were the better off - those Middle Englanders who submitted to the ordeal of taking to the roads on brand-new mountain bikes in search of the last chilled coronation chicken in Waitrose, hopeful that their impoverishment would at last be recognised. </p> <p>And so it might be. Never mind that the moderately well-off, beneficiaries of a 1p cut in income tax and among the lightest overall taxation in Europe, have a shaky claim on deprivation. They are self-styled victors in round one of the battle for lower petrol duty, and the Prime Minister, for all his professions of obduracy, will have to listen. And where does that leave the destitute? Already there is speculation that the pre-Budget report in November, expected to focus on poor pensioners, may instead be skewed towards balm for irate drivers. Blair is in a bind. To some extent, it is one of his own devising. </p> <p>In June 1997, he issued his pledge to the dispossessed. His stage set was the concrete walkways and stinking stairwells of the Aylesbury estate in Southwark, south London, and his message was unequivocal. 'For 18 years, the poorest people in our country have been forgotten by government. There will be no forgotten people in the Britain I want to build.' Of course, even the most stone-hearted of administrations bear in mind Aristotle's tenet that 'poverty is the parent of revolution and crime' and must be, where possible, minimised. In an age when Germinal -style insurrection seems the monopoly of the well-heeled wishing to skim a penny or two off the price of a litre of super-unleaded, the poor retain the sanction of inflating crime statistics, clogging up the NHS and depressing school league tables. </p> <p>Though the charge of cynicism may be unfair, the Government has certainly been guilty of a plethora of fatuous tactics. If only the poor would lock up their delinquent children after dark, eat their broccoli, keep their squeegees off the windscreens of impoverished motorists, eschew divorce and follow the David Blunkett DIY guide to assisting with homework, they and we would all be better off. Such nanny statism tends to ignore evidence that discrepancies in health and education are not merely the result of lifestyle choices or even poor income. Inequality itself is the killer. Fat-cat bosses, beneficiaries of a 72 per cent pay rise since 1994, are less prone to stress than their worst-paid workers. A labourer on 40 cigarettes a day runs a greater health risk than a chief executive. The less-privileged worker is, as a correspondent once wrote to Harry Truman, 'an eight-ulcer man on four-ulcer pay'. </p> <p>Blair is aware of all that. Hence his raft of worthwhile policies for the poor; a sincere attempt to redress the balance. The trouble is that reducing inequality has always been a subversive crusade in which New Labour, despite evidence of voter support for welfare spending, has shirked saying that higher taxation is the price of a fairer society with benefits to all. Instead it has preferred a patchwork of indirect taxes and backdoor redistribution designed to spare Middle England any suspicion that it is being clobbered. But now Mondeo man is at the barricades; partly because he has been propelled there by the right-wing press but also because Blair has allowed the myth of the something-for-nothing society to flourish. Meanwhile, convenient sources of cash for social projects - tax treatment of pension funds, the windfall levy on the privatised utilities - diminish. The Government is running out of road. </p> <p>In a paper published last week, John Hills, a professor of social policy at the London School of Economics, says that 'inequality clearly rose at the start of Labour's time in office'. Its record after the first 18 months bears two interpretations, according to Hills. The first is that its programme, though cheaper than an 'Old Labour' policy of uprating benefits with incomes, has delivered as much to low-income groups while also improving work incentives. The alternative view is that 'tax and benefit reforms have only barely delivered enough to the lowest income groups to prevent inequality rising. By themselves the measures may stem the rising tide of inequality but not reverse it'. Either way, Hills argues that more money will have to be ploughed in to prevent back-sliding on any progress so far. </p> <p>While not a wholesale indictment, such an assessment - coupled with the Rowntree Foundation's bleak audit of very recent figures - does not suggest that the DSS's own survey on poverty, out in a few days, will be entitled 'Mission Accomplished'. Nor does a chronicle of, at best, creeping progress and, at worst, mounting inequality echo Blair's ringing putsch on poverty, delivered on the Aylesbury estate. </p> <p>Since then, the very rich have thrived alarmingly. A combination of lavishly-trumpeted initiatives and grand, if distant, targets, such as eliminating child poverty by 2020, has fostered the idea that the worst-off are faring a lot better than they are. This comfortable misconception has lulled the affluent of Middle England into the barely-challenged notion that they are the ones deserving of a break: this time on petrol prices and, if that ploy works, perhaps a whole lot more besides. </p> <p>Of course it is easy, and correct, to rail against piratical oil companies and arrogant Ministers. But Blair's problem is not bullishness but timidity. It is time now to acknowledge that if we want better public services and a substantial erosion of poverty, we shall have to pay for them upfront. If that lesson is learned, then the petrol protesters, unalluring as they are, will have done us all a big favour.</p>",

Smith summoned the courage to bring back Richardson, and his third ball, a slower one pitched at yorker length, had Law leg before. </p> <p>Ronnie Irani, Essex's captain, is nothing if not a fighter.

A flick through the current county captains opens up two possibilities. Adam Hollioake captained the A side five years ago in Australia.

In both cases the selectors had better check that these two are keen on the job. Crawley, in particular, has not always been the most enthusiastic of tourists. </p> <p>The conditions in the West Indies should influence the balance of the tour party. Even though the Caribbean has been the cradle of pace in recent times, the spinners tend to do a lot of bowling in domestic cricket so it would not be absurd to take three on tour. The other caveat about cricket in the Caribbean has been the decline in the standard of their pitches (the Kensington Oval in Barbados being the exception) but I don't suppose they can be much worse than some of ours; nowadays at Worcester, once a haven for stroke-makers, you are fortunate to see cricket on the third day. </p> <p>The greatest head scratching will occur when choosing the opening batsmen. With the elevation of Marcus Trescothick there do not seem to be many good young ones around. The greatest confusion will be when the name of MJ Powell is announced. There are three playing county cricket; two of them, both named Michael, are strong candidates for the A tour. Glamor gan's Powell has obvious ability, though has not had been as productive this season as he was in 1999. Warwickshire's Powell has been in the runs and usually opens the batting.

There is a glaring gap in the market and you can almost picture the ad in the educational supplements now: </p> <p> The University of Fairlop (UNFAIR) is pleased to offer a five-year degree in the art and science of political manoeuvring and machinations within a football club, with a view to keeping one's job. Students will be expected to have thick skins but may experience thinning hair. </p> <p>Who knows, perhaps the Chelsea chairman could offer his services as visiting tutor emeritus? </p> <p>It was the week when English football finally went crazy - make that the week when its craziness was confirmed - with the sacking of a manager for being successful. All over this country now, managers are ashen-faced at the prospect of winning the FA Cup. After all, such a piffling pot no longer seems good enough for a club who until three years ago went 27 years without a major trophy. </p> <p>Gianluca Vialli - the overseer of five trophies in two-and-a-half years in fact - got Chelsea's boot because they wanted a 'change of direction', according to their managing director, Colin Hutchinson. He and Mr Bates (who shows that you do keep a dog and bark yourself) could get their wish. After all, new coach Claudio Ranieri walked out on Atletico Madrid after leading them towards relegation. </p> <p>I once put it to Mr Hutchinson that his club aspired to be the Manchester United of the South.

These days, the most sophisticated of European coaching courses encompass such new-age subjects as physiology and nutrition but appear to contain little tuition about handling whimsical, over-demanding owners, presidents or chairmen. There is a glaring gap in the market and you can almost picture the ad in the educational supplements now: The University of Fairlop (UNFAIR) is pleased to offer a five-year degree in the art and science of political manoeuvring and machinations within a football club, with a view to keeping one's job. Students will be expected to have thick skins but may experience thinning hair. Who knows, perhaps the Chelsea chairman could offer his services as visiting tutor emeritus? It was the week when English football finally went crazy - make that the week when its craziness was confirmed - with the sacking of a manager for being successful. All over this country now, managers are ashen-faced at the prospect of winning the FA Cup. After all, such a piffling pot no longer seems good enough for a club who until three years ago went 27 years without a major trophy. Gianluca Vialli - the overseer of five trophies in two-and-a-half years in fact - got Chelsea's boot because they wanted a 'change of direction', according to their managing director, Colin Hutchinson. He and Mr Bates (who shows that you do keep a dog and bark yourself) could get their wish. After all, new coach Claudio Ranieri walked out on Atletico Madrid after leading them towards relegation. I once put it to Mr Hutchinson that his club aspired to be the Manchester United of the South. He bridled at the suggestion. It is clear, though, that is exactly what they want to be. Simply, Chelsea see United heading into the distance to championships and European Cups and they want it - and they want it now.

Player goes down injured and doesn't get up, first person to appreciate the seriousness of the situation boots the ball into touch, possession is eventually returned via a tame throw-in once the injured man has received treatment. </p> <p>The crowd usually applaud at this point, in appreciation of the sportsmanship involved. If you think about it, the reason they express approval is because spectators know there is nothing in the rules that demands a player return the ball to his opponents. There is a school of thought that says possession need not be handed back if the ball was kicked out by a player anxious to secure treatment for a team-mate, and another that insists the only sporting course of action is to return the ball in every case regardless of whose player went down, but the only rule is that there are no rules - apart from the one that says the throw-in goes to the opponents of the team who touched the ball last. The fact that the team taking the throw are free to do whatever they like with the possession they have been granted is implicitly acknowledged by the ripple of applause that normally breaks around the ground. </p> <p>This is an important point, because there have been a couple of examples of normal procedure not being adhered to in recent weeks. In both cases, teams have profited by doing the unsporting thing, by retaining possession and scoring a goal directly from the throw. Both Derby County in the Premiership and Notts County in Nationwide Division Two salvaged a point from what might otherwise have been a defeat by doing so. And both Middlesbrough and Bristol Rovers, their respective opponents, are understandably miffed, to the extent where Bristol Rovers are now saying that unless referees are given firm guidelines to clear up this grey area, the whole practice will fall into disuse and football will lose one of its last vestiges of sporting etiquette as well as a useful safety mechanism. </p> <p>Of the two examples quoted above, more people are likely to be familiar with the Middlesbrough case, since it was briefly covered on that night's Match of the Day . Boro managed to leak another two goals through conventional Derby attacks, however, and (grey area turns positively murky) were almost certainly time wasting anyway, so for several reasons what happened to Bristol Rovers at the County Ground last week is a more clear-cut injustice. </p> <p>Rovers were winning 1-0 with two minutes to go. Their centre-half Steve Foster stayed down after a crunching tackle on the edge of his penalty area, at which goalkeeper Nick Culkin threw the ball out of play by a corner flag. With Foster off the field receiving treatment, Culkin then came to the edge of his area to facilitate an easy return, but having confirmed his intention to the referee County's Craig Ramage threw to a team-mate and Mark Stallard was able to equalise in the final minute with the goalkeeper sprinting to recover his position. Sharp work, undoubtedly. 'Cheating,' was the exact word Rovers manager Ian Holloway used, with perhaps a tad more justification than Bryan Robson, but what to do about it? No law had been infringed. There was no reason for the goal not to stand. </p> <p>Rovers' request for a rematch, citing the famous Arsenal-Sheffield United precedent of two years ago, was predictably pooh-poohed by both FA and Football League, although the club claim they were principally interested in clarification on the issue. 'We understood all along that there were some aspects in which the Arsenal game was unique, and that the FA would probably never have consented to that rematch had not Ars\u00e8ne Wenger generously offered it,' said Ralph Ellis, Rovers' commercial manager. 'On that subject it was noticeable that while the Notts County directors were very apologetic afterwards they stopped short of offering to play the game again, but rematch or not we feel there is a broader issue that needs tidying up.' </p> <p>This boils down to whether referees should be allowed any scope to prevent sporting behaviour - eg kicking the ball out of play - rebounding against a team. The FA, still smarting from the slap on the wrist they received from Fifa over the Arsenal rematch, claim there is no scope at all for even talking about unwritten rules. You either return the ball, which is sporting, or keep it, which is unsporting. Both alternatives are possible, and therefore permissible. The one thing you cannot do with an unwritten rule is enforce it, not unilaterally at any rate. </p> <p>Football's governing bodies normally attract criticism for ignoring problems in the hope they will go away, but this is one that just might. If many more teams adopt a cynical policy, players will soon stop kicking the ball out of play in the first place and leave it to the referee to hold up the game for injury. </p> <p>That might seem sensible, but there are occasions when the referee is too busy keeping up to notice an incident in back play, or when an injury requires immediate treatment. Bristol Rovers had a player swallow his tongue on the pitch recently, and Holloway can confirm he will continue to instruct his players to kick the ball out if they see a player in difficulty, regardless of what has just happened. 'I hope we don't get a situation where teams refuse to put the ball out of play, for the obvious reason that some injuries can be serious or even life-threatening and immediate treatment is vital,' Holloway said. 'This is not just about Bristol Rovers losing two points. This is an issue for all levels of football to consider, from the Premiership down to the Dog and Duck versus the Gasworks.' </p> <p>Pity no one wants to consider it. Even the normally upbeat Professional Footballers Association are relatively coy on the subject. 'We expect to see sporting behaviour,' the PFA's Brendan Batson said. 'In fact we have circulated all our members to that effect, but that's about as much as we can do. I think it's worth pointing out that for every example of bad sportsmanship there are hundreds of examples of sporting behaviour. I see a lot of football games, and I've never seen one of these controversies, so let's keep things in perspective. We might just have had two in a week, but I don't think we'll see too many repetitions.' </p> <p>Batson takes the old pro's view that these situations can be avoided with common sense from all concerned. It has probably occurred to most readers already that last week's unpleasantness would not have happened had the Bristol goalkeeper kicked the ball out near the half way line, or not anticipated his opponent behaving in a certain way. 'You've got to cover yourself,' Batson said. 'Most managers don't want to see throw-ins conceded near goal in any circumstances. I was always told that if I must put it out, put it out as far upfield as possible.'</p>",

      "byline": "Alan Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>To cheat or not to cheat, that is the question players have to ask themselves when the ball is thrown out of play to allow an injured opponent to be treated. </p> <p>Cheating may be too strong a word for taking advantage of an opponent's courtesy and sportsmanship, but that is what it is in effect. </p> <p>The debate has been stirred up by incidents in the Notts County-Bristol Rovers and Middlesbrough-Derby games, when players decided to go against the common practice of returning the ball to their opponents and went on to score goals that affected the result. </p> <p>On both occasions, the clubs on the receiving end were furious that one of the game's remaining vestiges of true sporting behaviour was being abused. </p> <p>I share that view, but I think we have to look beyond what the players do and ask questions of the managers involved. If we as managers do not take a moral lead, no one will, quite frankly. </p> <p>I don't want to sound pious about this, but there are - or should be - clear boundaries between what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and the vast majority of people in the game understand that and do the right thing. </p> <p>At Crystal Palace we have a clear view on what to do if a player is injured - put the ball out of touch straight away. Of course, we expect to receive it back after the injured player has been treated, as happens 99 per cent of the time. </p> <p>I imagine I would be as incensed as the players and staff of Bristol Rovers and Middlesbrough if we received the same response as they did - but it has not happened to us so far and I sincerely hope it never does. </p> <p>I know there is an argument that there is so much money and pressure in football now that players and managers are only being ultra-professional in trying to gain any advantage they can, but that does not wash with me. </p> <p>If you pursue that line of thinking, where do we stop? Should we make an exception for professionals but not in the parks and the schools, where the vast majority of football is played? </p> <p>The professional game is so pervasive at every level of society now that people, particularly the young, see footballers as role models and take their moral leads from them. What sort of message are we sending out if we condone cheating? </p> <p>There is another line of thought that referees should decide what to do in such situations. At the moment, they are obliged to stop play only if they consider a player to have a serious head injury. But the officials already have enough on their plate during a game, so it would only add to the pressure on them if they had to make instant judgments about whether a player is seriously injured or making a meal of it every time one goes down. </p> <p>We all criticise them enough anyway - players, managers, fans, media. Perhaps it is time we took more responsibility ourselves rather than look for someone to blame. </p> <p>The hard truth for most managers, players and fans is that games are not lost because of refereeing errors, but because of our own inadequacies. </p> <p>Unfortunately the blame culture is too prevalent in this country, and people look to pass the buck or point the finger rather than address their own situations. </p> <p>That is why I think managers should take the lead and adopt a strong moral stance. The League Manager's Association is a very good 'union', but we rarely use it as a talking shop for these sort of issues. Perhaps we should do so much more, but today's managers tend to keep their own counsel and not confide in each other as often as we could do. </p> <p>We all say we want honest players, and in my experience the majority of players are extremely honest. You do get the odd one who looks to cut corners, but they are usually players who are not good enough to succeed without recourse to cheating. And let's face it - if a player is prepared to cheat on the field, he is also likely to do it in training or away from the pitch. </p> <p>The good players don't do it because they don't have to. I have to admit we were recently awarded a penalty which looked dubious. When I saw the incident on video, it confirmed my suspicions and I told the players what I thought of it. Perhaps it was significant that we failed to score from the resulting penalty - was that some sort of natural justice?</p>",

      "bodyText": "To cheat or not to cheat, that is the question players have to ask themselves when the ball is thrown out of play to allow an injured opponent to be treated. Cheating may be too strong a word for taking advantage of an opponent's courtesy and sportsmanship, but that is what it is in effect. The debate has been stirred up by incidents in the Notts County-Bristol Rovers and Middlesbrough-Derby games, when players decided to go against the common practice of returning the ball to their opponents and went on to score goals that affected the result. On both occasions, the clubs on the receiving end were furious that one of the game's remaining vestiges of true sporting behaviour was being abused. I share that view, but I think we have to look beyond what the players do and ask questions of the managers involved. If we as managers do not take a moral lead, no one will, quite frankly. I don't want to sound pious about this, but there are - or should be - clear boundaries between what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and the vast majority of people in the game understand that and do the right thing. At Crystal Palace we have a clear view on what to do if a player is injured - put the ball out of touch straight away. Of course, we expect to receive it back after the injured player has been treated, as happens 99 per cent of the time. I imagine I would be as incensed as the players and staff of Bristol Rovers and Middlesbrough if we received the same response as they did - but it has not happened to us so far and I sincerely hope it never does. I know there is an argument that there is so much money and pressure in football now that players and managers are only being ultra-professional in trying to gain any advantage they can, but that does not wash with me. If you pursue that line of thinking, where do we stop? Should we make an exception for professionals but not in the parks and the schools, where the vast majority of football is played? The professional game is so pervasive at every level of society now that people, particularly the young, see footballers as role models and take their moral leads from them. What sort of message are we sending out if we condone cheating? There is another line of thought that referees should decide what to do in such situations. At the moment, they are obliged to stop play only if they consider a player to have a serious head injury. But the officials already have enough on their plate during a game, so it would only add to the pressure on them if they had to make instant judgments about whether a player is seriously injured or making a meal of it every time one goes down. We all criticise them enough anyway - players, managers, fans, media. Perhaps it is time we took more responsibility ourselves rather than look for someone to blame. The hard truth for most managers, players and fans is that games are not lost because of refereeing errors, but because of our own inadequacies. Unfortunately the blame culture is too prevalent in this country, and people look to pass the buck or point the finger rather than address their own situations. That is why I think managers should take the lead and adopt a strong moral stance. The League Manager's Association is a very good 'union', but we rarely use it as a talking shop for these sort of issues. Perhaps we should do so much more, but today's managers tend to keep their own counsel and not confide in each other as often as we could do. We all say we want honest players, and in my experience the majority of players are extremely honest. You do get the odd one who looks to cut corners, but they are usually players who are not good enough to succeed without recourse to cheating. And let's face it - if a player is prepared to cheat on the field, he is also likely to do it in training or away from the pitch. The good players don't do it because they don't have to. I have to admit we were recently awarded a penalty which looked dubious. When I saw the incident on video, it confirmed my suspicions and I told the players what I thought of it. Perhaps it was significant that we failed to score from the resulting penalty - was that some sort of natural justice?",

      "body": "<p>You are Kings Road plc and when you claim on your brochures that you are dead sophisticated, you even spell it right. The trouble is that the football end of your business - one of your main sidelines - isn't going too well. </p> <p>There are problems with the staff, hardly any of them speak English (you just can't get them these days, it must be the wages). You'll need someone who is hard on them, but urbane, because they'll need to spin a good line with the media. Important that, because it's the media who ensure that your style never goes out of fashion. </p> <p>You've tried promoting from within, because they appeared to speak the same language as the ones they had to supervise. But that didn't work, they didn't manage exactly what you were looking for. </p> <p>Oh, and working with the chairman can prove tricky. Step forward Claudio Ranieri, virtually unknown in London (until Friday evening), but a nom de household on the Continent. Well, Spain and Italy, and that's where it matters. </p> <p>Unemployed? He can't be that good. Who sacked him last? They didn't, he walked out on Atletico Madrid, departing every bit as stylishly as the manner in which he coaches. </p> <p>More to the point, he has worked successfully with Spanish club presidents, one of whom, Jesus Gil, makes Ken Bates look like Ken Barlow. </p> <p>Everyone who gets to rub shoulders with him will realise that he is a joy to deal with. He will do wonders for Chelsea Village, generally brighten up the place, and club employees and the media will love him. </p> <p>Where the 'sergeant' name he has acquired comes in is where it's most needed, on the training pitch. As a coach Ranieri combines the four most vital qualities: getting the players in tip-top condition, as a tactician, a motivator and a team-builder. </p> <p>Ranieri is reminiscent of a less prickly George Graham. He will come in, and boy, will the players know about it in training. Ranieri is theatrical, and he bawls, screams and generally cajoles until his charges get to do whatever it was that was demanded of them in the first place. </p> <p>Ranieri is nothing if not Italian, and where as before the sons of Rome exported their military might, their modern-day versions build from the back. A team is built from the defence up, the midfield support the defence and press their opponents, and when on the attack, the defenders support the midfield. </p> <p>Ranieri's teams do not speculate, men are behind the ball, and he is quite content to sit back and defend on the edge of the area. His sides threaten principally from the counter-attack, where training will have worked on speed, verticality and the players supporting each other. </p> <p>After one game, when his Valencia team had shown defensive lapses, he was asked about imposing a more Italian style. 'If I could, I would love to impose a catenaccio. ' In actual fact, Ranieri regards that most Italian of innovations, the bolt-like defence, as old hat. He is, in every sense, a modern coach. </p> <p>Style takes a very second place to results, a scrambled 1-0 win will suit him fine. The game is about winning, playing nicely is not his concern, late surrenders are unlikely under Ranieri, and a disinterested performance away to a Bradford or Watford a virtual impossibility. </p> <p>Ranieri is always on top of things. The fans will get to love his expressive touchline persona, the players will not. Not for him the sitting impassively on the bench while events on the pitch take their course. Claudio is the admiral on the deck, but exhorting and pointing, and gesturing to the heavens above in that uniquely Mediterranean ' porca miseria ' affectation. </p> <p>If word has not yet reached the players via Zola and Hasselbaink, then the Chelsea strollers are in for a shock. Training under Ranieri is hell. In will come a Mr Bean lookalike - Signor Roberto Sassi - the fitness coach, and regular sessions with the Conconi machine, a beeping endurance test, one of several designed to build up and periodically test the levels of fitness and stamina. </p> <p>Pre-season is important to Ranieri and his methods, meaning that it may not be until 2001-2002 that the full fruits of his industry are appreciated. His training methods are important to the work on the pitch, but his selection of the personnel and the way the team blends are also his forte. </p> <p> TO A GREAT extent he provided the base for the unfancied Valencia that reached the Champions League final. He made the great Mendieta the player he is, blooded Farinos and Angulo, and converted a second-rate Claudio Lope into a world-beater. </p> <p>He left Valencia following a blistering demonstration of superiority in a 3-0 Spanish Cup triumph, much to the chagrin of all concerned, to work with Jesus Gil, because of his daughter's education in Madrid. </p> <p>At Valencia he had worked under Paco Roig - an apprentice Jesus Gil - and ironically only had problems with his mild-mannered successor. Throughout his career, Ranieri appears to have thrived on working with strong personalities that match his own. There is, therefore, hope for the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 Ken after all. </p> <p>The resulting product on the pitch may not be pretty to watch at times, but if it brings Milan in place of St Gallen you might not hear that many complaints down the Kings Road.</p> <p><strong>Ranieri fact file</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Claudio Ranieri, born 20/10/51 (Rome) </strong></p> <p>1969-1986: Unspectacular playing career with Roma, Catanzaro and Catania. </p> <p><strong>Coaching career</strong></p> <p>Vigor (86-87)<br> Campania (87-88)<br> Cagliari (88-91)<br> Napoli - where he coached Gianfranco Zola (91-93)<br> Fiorentina (93-97) - won Serie B 94; Coppa d'Italia and Supercopa, 96<br> Valencia, Spain (97-99) - wins Copa del Rey, 99<br> Atletico Madrid, Spain (99-00) - quits in March, club relegated later. </p> <p><strong> Honours</strong><br>Italian Cup (1996), Italian Supercup (1996), Spanish Cup (1999) </p>",

      "bodyText": "You are Kings Road plc and when you claim on your brochures that you are dead sophisticated, you even spell it right. The trouble is that the football end of your business - one of your main sidelines - isn't going too well. There are problems with the staff, hardly any of them speak English (you just can't get them these days, it must be the wages). You'll need someone who is hard on them, but urbane, because they'll need to spin a good line with the media. Important that, because it's the media who ensure that your style never goes out of fashion. You've tried promoting from within, because they appeared to speak the same language as the ones they had to supervise. But that didn't work, they didn't manage exactly what you were looking for. Oh, and working with the chairman can prove tricky. Step forward Claudio Ranieri, virtually unknown in London (until Friday evening), but a nom de household on the Continent. Well, Spain and Italy, and that's where it matters. Unemployed? He can't be that good. Who sacked him last? They didn't, he walked out on Atletico Madrid, departing every bit as stylishly as the manner in which he coaches. More to the point, he has worked successfully with Spanish club presidents, one of whom, Jesus Gil, makes Ken Bates look like Ken Barlow. Everyone who gets to rub shoulders with him will realise that he is a joy to deal with. He will do wonders for Chelsea Village, generally brighten up the place, and club employees and the media will love him. Where the 'sergeant' name he has acquired comes in is where it's most needed, on the training pitch. As a coach Ranieri combines the four most vital qualities: getting the players in tip-top condition, as a tactician, a motivator and a team-builder. Ranieri is reminiscent of a less prickly George Graham. He will come in, and boy, will the players know about it in training. Ranieri is theatrical, and he bawls, screams and generally cajoles until his charges get to do whatever it was that was demanded of them in the first place. Ranieri is nothing if not Italian, and where as before the sons of Rome exported their military might, their modern-day versions build from the back. A team is built from the defence up, the midfield support the defence and press their opponents, and when on the attack, the defenders support the midfield. Ranieri's teams do not speculate, men are behind the ball, and he is quite content to sit back and defend on the edge of the area. His sides threaten principally from the counter-attack, where training will have worked on speed, verticality and the players supporting each other. After one game, when his Valencia team had shown defensive lapses, he was asked about imposing a more Italian style. 'If I could, I would love to impose a catenaccio. ' In actual fact, Ranieri regards that most Italian of innovations, the bolt-like defence, as old hat. He is, in every sense, a modern coach. Style takes a very second place to results, a scrambled 1-0 win will suit him fine. The game is about winning, playing nicely is not his concern, late surrenders are unlikely under Ranieri, and a disinterested performance away to a Bradford or Watford a virtual impossibility. Ranieri is always on top of things. The fans will get to love his expressive touchline persona, the players will not. Not for him the sitting impassively on the bench while events on the pitch take their course. Claudio is the admiral on the deck, but exhorting and pointing, and gesturing to the heavens above in that uniquely Mediterranean ' porca miseria ' affectation. If word has not yet reached the players via Zola and Hasselbaink, then the Chelsea strollers are in for a shock. Training under Ranieri is hell. In will come a Mr Bean lookalike - Signor Roberto Sassi - the fitness coach, and regular sessions with the Conconi machine, a beeping endurance test, one of several designed to build up and periodically test the levels of fitness and stamina. Pre-season is important to Ranieri and his methods, meaning that it may not be until 2001-2002 that the full fruits of his industry are appreciated. His training methods are important to the work on the pitch, but his selection of the personnel and the way the team blends are also his forte. TO A GREAT extent he provided the base for the unfancied Valencia that reached the Champions League final. He made the great Mendieta the player he is, blooded Farinos and Angulo, and converted a second-rate Claudio Lope into a world-beater. He left Valencia following a blistering demonstration of superiority in a 3-0 Spanish Cup triumph, much to the chagrin of all concerned, to work with Jesus Gil, because of his daughter's education in Madrid. At Valencia he had worked under Paco Roig - an apprentice Jesus Gil - and ironically only had problems with his mild-mannered successor. Throughout his career, Ranieri appears to have thrived on working with strong personalities that match his own. There is, therefore, hope for the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 Ken after all. The resulting product on the pitch may not be pretty to watch at times, but if it brings Milan in place of St Gallen you might not hear that many complaints down the Kings Road.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A monsoon has hit Chadwell Heath, the sky is the colour of charcoal, and a deeply tanned Paolo Di Canio scoots around West Ham's training ground sporting buttercup-tinted sunglasses. It is impossible for his outlook on life to be grey so, hey presto, he finds a way to bring in an instant rainbow. </p> <p>Scanning a compilation of Di Canio's greatest hits during his four-year stint in Britain it is necessary to take a deep breath every so often, because the list is so exhaustive. This son of the south of Italy does not comprehend the notion of doing things by halves. He does things by doubles. </p> <p>Why simply feel miffed when the manager leaves your club (in this case Tommy Burns and Celtic) when you can huff publicly, abandon training, and gallop out of town on a \u00a34.5 million transfer? Why merely get sent off when you can send a referee tumbling over (step forward Paul Alcock), provoke an 11-match ban, and go awol into the bargain? Why score a tap-in when you can caress the ball with a balletic mid-air flick to claim goal of the season? The list goes on and on. </p> <p>So regularly is he the protagonist in some operatic melodrama, it must be darned hard work being Paolo Di Canio. Hear him open his heart, watch his extravagant gesticulations, listen to his boundless enthusiasm in full flow and you realise what an irresistible life it must be. Yes, his wild temperament courts controversy, but the pros render the cons almost insignificant. 'My character made many problems for me in football but without it I wouldn't play at the top level. If I had to weigh up the positives and the negatives I have to say thank you God, or whoever, because I was lucky.' </p> <p>But surely, had he been luckier he could have enjoyed a more successful career. His spontaneous gifts would not look out of place in the colours of his country, or as a regular performer in the Champions League, or in a team capable of winning the Premiership. When ability and attitude are in perfect harmony, he can emulate Giggs, Bergkamp, Zola, Kewell - even Del Piero, Totti, Inzaghi. </p> <p>'Everybody says when they meet me I deserve to play for a bigger team,' he says, surprised that they don't feel - as he does - that West Ham inspire his very best. 'Taxi drivers say, \"Why don't you play for Man United?\" What do you mean I deserve to play for Man United? I play well here because this squad give me the opportunity. Maybe at Man United I wouldn't play so well because here I get 50 balls per game and Man United you have to share 50 balls with players like Beckham, Giggs, Scholes. Here I have the opportunity to turn the game. The team believe in me, they trust me, they give me opportunities. \"Come on Paolo!\" they tell me every time. \"Come on Paolo, you can win the game for us!\" They give me energy, power, even when I am tired.' He becomes wonderfully animated merely thinking about it. </p> <p>No topic inspires him quite like the old chestnut of referees. He's convinced they don't like him. He can't help implying that they come from the George Orwell school of all players being equal but some more equal than others. To illustrate the point he ends up dramatising a scene where he is shot in the back by a defender with a gun. 'Is that a penalty, ref?' he gasps, his dying words, before roaring with laughter at the twist when the referee books him for diving as he is carted off to the mortuary. </p> <p>'I argue with referees a lot. I do this when I don't see a fair attitude from them. Sometimes I would like to say something in a more gentle way but you have snap decisions. It's difficult to say something like an Oxford student [he pops a plum in his mouth] \"I'm sorry, why didn't you give me a penalty?\" I'm jealous of players who can say it calmly but I can't do that.' </p> <p>Even though Harry Redknapp is notoriously crafty in the transfer market, the \u00a31.7 million he negotiated to bring Di Canio to West Ham has to be his best hustle yet. Had Sheffield Wednesday not been in such a predicament such a bid would have been dismissed as laughable. There was a small element of risk for the Londoners, given they were taking on a player with so much disciplinary 'previous', but Di Canio's lavish talent, coupled with a dedicated attitude to training and to winning, obliterates risk. </p> <p>Redknapp is Di Canio's most vociferous supporter. When his showman is criticised he fumes in defence. Praise often prompts an equally prickly response, as if it bugs him that people who are so quick to castigate can suddenly take off the blinkers and admire the Italian's brilliance. </p> <p>The lifebelt West Ham threw him when he was scraping the depths touched Di Canio deeply and he consequently developed a genuine affection for them. 'Every club I gave my best but there is a special situation here at West Ham and maybe I'm giving more because they helped me when I was very down. This club gave me a big hand. So, because of this I give everything I have, all my energy, because I feel the people, the club, the shirt are part of my life now. Honestly. </p> <p>'Maybe people don't trust me when I say it but I'd prefer to score two own goals and win 3-2 than score four goals and lose 5-4. At the end of the season if we go down, I go down with the squad. That's no glory. I prefer to score 20 own goals in one season and win the cup than score 45 goals and be relegated.' West Ham's position at the foot of the table doesn't worry him because he believes in the quality around him.

Not manager [he chortles] because Harry is a good manager and I don't want to replace him.' </p> <p>Anyway, he confesses, he's not sure he could supplant his joker's mentality in the dressing room with the required authority for management. 'We say in Italy to be a good manager you have to be a bit of a bastard.

Lazio were his boyhood club, the team he followed all over the country getting into occasional scrapes - 'but no knives' he's quick to point out - and having scored the goal to beat Roma for the first time in years, he was photographed celebrating with a middle finger raised in the direction of the opposition fans. A reputation was born. This, he believes, is part of the explanation for a closed door to the national team. 'In Italy they don't like it when people speak too much. We look like a democratic nation but we are not. We have to shut up. I tell people what I think. If we play crap, we play crap. Full stop. No excuses. Vialli had the same problem with Arrigo Sacchi, and Zenga the keeper was a bit crazy. They don't like that. They like you to say \"Yes, Sir\". This is not my job. </p> <p>'Everyone says to me, Paolo, why weren't you ever called up for the national squad? I don't know why, maybe I am crazy. Not because I think I am the best but I think I deserve one opportunity. Not more. One! I told everybody I don't want to play in Euro 2000 or the World Cup 2002. Just one friendly game, one training session. I don't ask for the moon.' </p> <p>At least Di Canio can talk for Italy. His passion on the field has its roots in an appalling injury suffered as a teenager. When an Achilles tendon became infected doctors told him he might not walk normally again and told him there was a risk he would lose a leg. After the operation, it took him 14 months to recover. When he became a professional footballer he vowed to give 100 per cent every day for the rest of his career. </p> <p>Football, he preaches, is not football unless there is emotion. He is staggered that the authorities are clamping down on goal celebrations. First they banned breaching the touchline to hug the fans, now stripping off a shirt is illegal.

It is the most emotional time for everybody!' </p> <p>We are fortunate to have him here.

You want to go to the disco with your friends. Now I understand. </p> <p>'My parents gave me principles. My father was a brickie, but with principles.

      "bodyText": "A monsoon has hit Chadwell Heath, the sky is the colour of charcoal, and a deeply tanned Paolo Di Canio scoots around West Ham's training ground sporting buttercup-tinted sunglasses. It is impossible for his outlook on life to be grey so, hey presto, he finds a way to bring in an instant rainbow. Scanning a compilation of Di Canio's greatest hits during his four-year stint in Britain it is necessary to take a deep breath every so often, because the list is so exhaustive. This son of the south of Italy does not comprehend the notion of doing things by halves. He does things by doubles. Why simply feel miffed when the manager leaves your club (in this case Tommy Burns and Celtic) when you can huff publicly, abandon training, and gallop out of town on a \u00a34.5 million transfer? Why merely get sent off when you can send a referee tumbling over (step forward Paul Alcock), provoke an 11-match ban, and go awol into the bargain? Why score a tap-in when you can caress the ball with a balletic mid-air flick to claim goal of the season? The list goes on and on. So regularly is he the protagonist in some operatic melodrama, it must be darned hard work being Paolo Di Canio. Hear him open his heart, watch his extravagant gesticulations, listen to his boundless enthusiasm in full flow and you realise what an irresistible life it must be. Yes, his wild temperament courts controversy, but the pros render the cons almost insignificant. 'My character made many problems for me in football but without it I wouldn't play at the top level. If I had to weigh up the positives and the negatives I have to say thank you God, or whoever, because I was lucky.' But surely, had he been luckier he could have enjoyed a more successful career. His spontaneous gifts would not look out of place in the colours of his country, or as a regular performer in the Champions League, or in a team capable of winning the Premiership. When ability and attitude are in perfect harmony, he can emulate Giggs, Bergkamp, Zola, Kewell - even Del Piero, Totti, Inzaghi. 'Everybody says when they meet me I deserve to play for a bigger team,' he says, surprised that they don't feel - as he does - that West Ham inspire his very best. 'Taxi drivers say, \"Why don't you play for Man United?\" What do you mean I deserve to play for Man United? I play well here because this squad give me the opportunity. Maybe at Man United I wouldn't play so well because here I get 50 balls per game and Man United you have to share 50 balls with players like Beckham, Giggs, Scholes. Here I have the opportunity to turn the game. The team believe in me, they trust me, they give me opportunities. \"Come on Paolo!\" they tell me every time. \"Come on Paolo, you can win the game for us!\" They give me energy, power, even when I am tired.' He becomes wonderfully animated merely thinking about it. No topic inspires him quite like the old chestnut of referees. He's convinced they don't like him. He can't help implying that they come from the George Orwell school of all players being equal but some more equal than others. To illustrate the point he ends up dramatising a scene where he is shot in the back by a defender with a gun. 'Is that a penalty, ref?' he gasps, his dying words, before roaring with laughter at the twist when the referee books him for diving as he is carted off to the mortuary. 'I argue with referees a lot. I do this when I don't see a fair attitude from them. Sometimes I would like to say something in a more gentle way but you have snap decisions. It's difficult to say something like an Oxford student [he pops a plum in his mouth] \"I'm sorry, why didn't you give me a penalty?\" I'm jealous of players who can say it calmly but I can't do that.' Even though Harry Redknapp is notoriously crafty in the transfer market, the \u00a31.7 million he negotiated to bring Di Canio to West Ham has to be his best hustle yet. Had Sheffield Wednesday not been in such a predicament such a bid would have been dismissed as laughable. There was a small element of risk for the Londoners, given they were taking on a player with so much disciplinary 'previous', but Di Canio's lavish talent, coupled with a dedicated attitude to training and to winning, obliterates risk. Redknapp is Di Canio's most vociferous supporter. When his showman is criticised he fumes in defence. Praise often prompts an equally prickly response, as if it bugs him that people who are so quick to castigate can suddenly take off the blinkers and admire the Italian's brilliance. The lifebelt West Ham threw him when he was scraping the depths touched Di Canio deeply and he consequently developed a genuine affection for them. 'Every club I gave my best but there is a special situation here at West Ham and maybe I'm giving more because they helped me when I was very down. This club gave me a big hand. So, because of this I give everything I have, all my energy, because I feel the people, the club, the shirt are part of my life now. Honestly. 'Maybe people don't trust me when I say it but I'd prefer to score two own goals and win 3-2 than score four goals and lose 5-4. At the end of the season if we go down, I go down with the squad. That's no glory. I prefer to score 20 own goals in one season and win the cup than score 45 goals and be relegated.' West Ham's position at the foot of the table doesn't worry him because he believes in the quality around him. 'I want to tell the supporters not to panic,' he announces, 'because I'm sure we'll turn it around.' Sure enough to resist overtures from Chelsea last week. When the \u00a34m bid came in he met with chairman and manager and it didn't take long for all concerned to reject the offer. As Di Canio recalls: 'We said to each other: \"We are a good marriage, why do we have to divorce?\" There are no problems between us.' It might have been a different story for \u00a315m. 'I would sacrifice myself for that price because I can help the club in a different way, to get big business. 'But \u00a34m? Not good for them, not good for me, because I have to move to a new club.

Most of the celebrations date back to colonial times, but the Festival of San Sebastian in the city of San Juan is a street party with a difference. The tradition only began last century to commemorate the old city, and now people flock from all over the island to join in the salsa and procession of 'cabezudos' - huge character masks which represent favourite policemen and mayors of the old town. </p> <p> <strong> February</strong><br> For five days before Ash Wednesday the streets of Port of Spain in <strong> Trinidad </strong> are taken over by one of the biggest and noisiest parties in the world. The Trinidad and Tobago Carnival (24-28 February 2001) is the original Caribbean carnival with costumed parades, calypso music, steel bands and dancing in the streets. The pre-Lenten Carnival is celebrated on islands throughout the Caribbean. </p> <p> <strong> March</strong><br> Irish visitors will be bemused but beguiled if they visit the community of Sauters on 17 March. The parish on the northern nape of <strong> Grenada</strong> is named after St Patrick, the Irish patron saint, thanks to the lasting influence of an Irish order of teacher priests.

Most of the celebrations date back to colonial times, but the Festival of San Sebastian in the city of San Juan is a street party with a difference. The tradition only began last century to commemorate the old city, and now people flock from all over the island to join in the salsa and procession of 'cabezudos' - huge character masks which represent favourite policemen and mayors of the old town. February For five days before Ash Wednesday the streets of Port of Spain in Trinidad are taken over by one of the biggest and noisiest parties in the world. The Trinidad and Tobago Carnival (24-28 February 2001) is the original Caribbean carnival with costumed parades, calypso music, steel bands and dancing in the streets. The pre-Lenten Carnival is celebrated on islands throughout the Caribbean. March Irish visitors will be bemused but beguiled if they visit the community of Sauters on 17 March.

      "body": "<p>The Caribbean is not for single people. Package holidays are priced on the assumption that you are going with a friend; the sunbeds are laid out in pairs and the local dance routines require a partner you know fairly well. None the less, on the first night of a two-week holiday in Antigua, I was content with my own company as I sat jetlagged in a bar in the island of Antigua. </p> <p>The sunset had turned the sky purple. My fellow holidaymakers were drunk, sunburnt and irresponsible, as portrayed in public health information films. But the illusory calm was shattered when confronted with a question I'd hear often over the next fortnight. A waitress, scoldingly slamming a gin and tonic down on my table, barked: 'What you doin' here on your own, boy?' </p> <p>My solitude was breaking the unwritten rules of the Caribbean. Signs of togetherness were all around me: couples walking arm in arm; couples dribbling into each other's frozen cocktails; couples rowing over who had eaten the last olive from the bowl on the bar. But with 'you got mail' noises still ringing in my ears, a packet of duty-free cigarettes was more than enough company. Solitude was a good thing. I had booked a last-minute package holiday, intent on meeting complete strangers whom I would never see again and, of course, to see something of the island. </p> <p>The level of romance in Antigua can begin to feel like a conspiracy after a while: the island is a popular wedding destination for Americans. The resorts are packed with the bride, groom and their respective families and friends. The ceremonies occur on small podiums on the edge of the shore - the groom putting a lavish tux over his beach shorts for a few hours. This atmosphere of connubial bliss can be contagious so, in order to keep yourself from evolving into a couple, observe a few simple maxims. Never spend more than one evening with the same group of people. Ensure your arms are long enough to apply sun cream to the farthest reaches of your back. When you find yourself trying to light the wrong end of your cigarette, go home. </p> <p>I paid approximately \u00a3600 to hire a showy Jeep for 14 days and was able to escape the world of lazy resorts into a densely vegetated, playful island. The courtesy bus from the airport had shown glimpses of Antigua several decades of development distant from the holiday resorts. People carried their water from the taps in the street while corrugated iron was an integral part of each village, as indeed were cricket and stray dogs. But once you enter the resort gates, Antigua is a world where golf buggies whirr between villas, where the poolside concrete is sticky with the half-dried remnants of spilled fruit purees, and one of the bars serves pizza all day long. The Jolly Beach Resort, where I stayed for a fortnight, has just about everything a holidaying suburbanite could want, bar an uncensored experience of Antigua. </p> <p>St John's, the island's shambolic capital, wears the island's penury better than you might expect. Down on the dock the cruise ships find a bay so their passengers may mill around the cigar and trinket boutiques before departing again. There is little nightlife here, and few restaurants. It is a quiet, dozy town. Typical of the disorder, the kerbs are built high enough to control the small floods of the rainy season, but are often ineffectual because of the litter piled across the drain grilles. Here the pace of life is slow and harmless and atrocities such as a 'Man badly scratched in casino brawl' are headlined in the island's newspaper. The police appear to carry firearms more as a counterbalance to the handcuffs on the other side of their belt, rather than because of any real danger. The closest I came to feeling uncomfortable was on driving south of the island to a residential area. Following a noise down a back street I discovered a half-built house that had been adapted as a nightclub. The bass notes from the music could be felt in the Jeep. My sunburnt skin and shorts identified me and aware of the stares I was attracting I felt unwelcome and drove on. </p> <p>On the road to the island's most heavily colonised nightspot, Shirley Heights, is the Old English Harbour. Long, gold-trimmed boats line the docks, toys of those we know must be rich. On the docks the Southern Cross restaurant with its crisp linen and maritime decor offers a view of the harbour, but much of the menu I and my companions tried was shrivelled and salty. Go there for their goldfish-bowl gin and tonics and fancy bread, then get someone else to drive you back to the new restaurant at the Jolly Beach resort. There the lobster is tender and fresh, and the Sancerre worth the price tag. </p> <p>Sundays are a day of rest, church and cricket for much of Antigua. In the resorts, life is as slow as every other day, but the evenings find a dynamism of their own on one of the highest hills on the island. Shirley Heights was formerly a colonial gun post, but now a steel band and reggae group enliven the bar once a week. From 6pm onwards a crowd bearing camcorders, homemade cigarettes and cans of Red Stripe gathers. To the left, the former British colony of Monserrat puffs ash into the sky, and to the right, planes carrying British and American tourists come in to land. </p> <p>The steel band and reggae groups play until around 10pm. The music is stereotypical Caribbean, but most aficionados seem satisfied. The sounds are loud, libidinous and loose. By the end of the evening, you may find yourself caught up in the music with somebody with whom you are not as familiar as your dance suggests. And then you can say that, for a moment at least, you obeyed the rules of the Caribbean.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Caribbean is not for single people. Package holidays are priced on the assumption that you are going with a friend; the sunbeds are laid out in pairs and the local dance routines require a partner you know fairly well. None the less, on the first night of a two-week holiday in Antigua, I was content with my own company as I sat jetlagged in a bar in the island of Antigua. The sunset had turned the sky purple. My fellow holidaymakers were drunk, sunburnt and irresponsible, as portrayed in public health information films. But the illusory calm was shattered when confronted with a question I'd hear often over the next fortnight. A waitress, scoldingly slamming a gin and tonic down on my table, barked: 'What you doin' here on your own, boy?' My solitude was breaking the unwritten rules of the Caribbean. Signs of togetherness were all around me: couples walking arm in arm; couples dribbling into each other's frozen cocktails; couples rowing over who had eaten the last olive from the bowl on the bar. But with 'you got mail' noises still ringing in my ears, a packet of duty-free cigarettes was more than enough company. Solitude was a good thing. I had booked a last-minute package holiday, intent on meeting complete strangers whom I would never see again and, of course, to see something of the island. The level of romance in Antigua can begin to feel like a conspiracy after a while: the island is a popular wedding destination for Americans. The resorts are packed with the bride, groom and their respective families and friends. The ceremonies occur on small podiums on the edge of the shore - the groom putting a lavish tux over his beach shorts for a few hours. This atmosphere of connubial bliss can be contagious so, in order to keep yourself from evolving into a couple, observe a few simple maxims. Never spend more than one evening with the same group of people. Ensure your arms are long enough to apply sun cream to the farthest reaches of your back. When you find yourself trying to light the wrong end of your cigarette, go home. I paid approximately \u00a3600 to hire a showy Jeep for 14 days and was able to escape the world of lazy resorts into a densely vegetated, playful island. The courtesy bus from the airport had shown glimpses of Antigua several decades of development distant from the holiday resorts. People carried their water from the taps in the street while corrugated iron was an integral part of each village, as indeed were cricket and stray dogs. But once you enter the resort gates, Antigua is a world where golf buggies whirr between villas, where the poolside concrete is sticky with the half-dried remnants of spilled fruit purees, and one of the bars serves pizza all day long. The Jolly Beach Resort, where I stayed for a fortnight, has just about everything a holidaying suburbanite could want, bar an uncensored experience of Antigua. St John's, the island's shambolic capital, wears the island's penury better than you might expect. Down on the dock the cruise ships find a bay so their passengers may mill around the cigar and trinket boutiques before departing again. There is little nightlife here, and few restaurants. It is a quiet, dozy town. Typical of the disorder, the kerbs are built high enough to control the small floods of the rainy season, but are often ineffectual because of the litter piled across the drain grilles. Here the pace of life is slow and harmless and atrocities such as a 'Man badly scratched in casino brawl' are headlined in the island's newspaper. The police appear to carry firearms more as a counterbalance to the handcuffs on the other side of their belt, rather than because of any real danger. The closest I came to feeling uncomfortable was on driving south of the island to a residential area. Following a noise down a back street I discovered a half-built house that had been adapted as a nightclub. The bass notes from the music could be felt in the Jeep. My sunburnt skin and shorts identified me and aware of the stares I was attracting I felt unwelcome and drove on. On the road to the island's most heavily colonised nightspot, Shirley Heights, is the Old English Harbour. Long, gold-trimmed boats line the docks, toys of those we know must be rich. On the docks the Southern Cross restaurant with its crisp linen and maritime decor offers a view of the harbour, but much of the menu I and my companions tried was shrivelled and salty. Go there for their goldfish-bowl gin and tonics and fancy bread, then get someone else to drive you back to the new restaurant at the Jolly Beach resort. There the lobster is tender and fresh, and the Sancerre worth the price tag. Sundays are a day of rest, church and cricket for much of Antigua. In the resorts, life is as slow as every other day, but the evenings find a dynamism of their own on one of the highest hills on the island. Shirley Heights was formerly a colonial gun post, but now a steel band and reggae group enliven the bar once a week. From 6pm onwards a crowd bearing camcorders, homemade cigarettes and cans of Red Stripe gathers. To the left, the former British colony of Monserrat puffs ash into the sky, and to the right, planes carrying British and American tourists come in to land. The steel band and reggae groups play until around 10pm. The music is stereotypical Caribbean, but most aficionados seem satisfied. The sounds are loud, libidinous and loose. By the end of the evening, you may find yourself caught up in the music with somebody with whom you are not as familiar as your dance suggests. And then you can say that, for a moment at least, you obeyed the rules of the Caribbean.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Observer:</strong> What is Eclipse about? </p> <p> <strong> John Banville:</strong> It's one of those puzzling books. It started out being about things that it didn't end up being about. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Can you elaborate? </p> <p> <strong> JB:</strong> At one point, I looked at it and I thought, my God, this is about a mid-life crisis, but Alexander Cleave is 50, so it's a late middle-age crisis. Well, it's obviously about a man falling apart, about a man who is self-made. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Why did you choose to have an actor as the narrator? </p> <p> <strong> JB:</strong> It was quite late in the writing of the book that I decided to make him an actor. At some point, I'm really going to have to stop dealing with these inauthentic men who have made themselves. But the curious thing is the more I look around... I mean, I was just reading Kenneth Tynan's journals in the New Yorker today - there was a man who made himself.</p> <p>If you look at practically anyone - I mean, I find this more and more - the more you look at people the more you find that they've actually manufactured themselves. People whose names that you know. I meet lots of people in my ordinary life, away from writing, who seem to be authentic, who seem to know where they've come from and who they are, but anyone that I deal with in, if you like, my profession, we all seem to have made ourselves. I think artists are all self-made. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> So, in some sense, Cleave reflects a part of you? </p> <p> <strong> JB:</strong> Oh, yes. We're all the people in our books. A few people who read Eclipse in manuscript said that they felt almost embarrassed because it seemed to be so personal. I suppose, in a way, it should be gratifying but I find it puzzling. I certainly didn't set out to write about myself. Physically, I'm entirely different from Cleave. I don't have the same attitudes - but maybe I did.</p> <p>The older I get, the more confused I get. I used to think that age would bring wisdom. It doesn't, it just brings confusion. But I find that this confusion is artistically useful. It's a kind of progression, a negative progression. It's moving into areas that you didn't know were there. It becomes more dreamlike all the time. When I was starting out as a novelist, I would have been furious if anyone said to me that novels are dream-like or that they're doing things the novelist didn't know he was doing. Now, I find that it's absolutely true. </p> <p>I find that the novel gets more and more like a strange dream that I'm having. I find that productive at the moment, but I don't know in what way. Maybe I'm moving from my middle late period into my late, late period. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Did you always want to be a novelist? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> Well I wanted to be an artist of some kind. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> How did you begin? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> I started to write when I was 11 or 12, doing bad imitations of Joyce. There were always white blossoms falling into the grave at the end of every story. I couldn't do the snow; Joyce had done that. And then I tried to paint. I was absolutely hopeless. I couldn't draw, I had no sense of colour and no sense of form. That's disadvantageous if you want to be a painter. </p> <p>But trying to be a painter did show me something about looking at the world in a specific way. I don't think any novelist is happy being just a novelist. I'm sure you know this. We should be poets. We should be composers and we should be making language do things that the novel won't allow you to do. This is what I've been trying to do for a long time. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> In some ways, the novel is rather a vulgar form, isn't it? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> In the best sense of the word, a vulgar form. Let's not despise story-telling. Like all novelists, I have this low desire to tell people stories. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> In this book, you challenge the reader. You pull it off, but you run a big risk because there really isn't much narrative. The denouement that we're building to is not much of a surprise. </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> I've never been very good at plot. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Eclipse is not, in narrative terms, very strong. It's beautifully written, but in narrative terms...</p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> Yes, the prose is going to have to carry the reader through. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> You do run quite a risk with that. </p> <p> <strong> JB:</strong> As the reviewers will note. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> It's in five parts. Are those five acts? After all, we have an actor as the protagonist. </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> I hadn't thought of that. That's probably true. I don't think of him professionally as an actor. I think when he is writing this book that he's gone past that. I don't think he'll ever act again. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Your last book, The Untouchable, was a big canvas, but this one feels like a miniature. Every book is a riposte to the previous one, isn't it? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> Someone asked Iris Murdoch why she wrote so many books and she said: 'I think each one will excuse all the ones that have gone before.' Riposte is very good. Yes, this is a riposte to The Untouchable. That was a big, public book. There's more felt life in this. There's more passion in this and it makes it more difficult to talk about. It was wonderfully easy to talk about The Untouchable because one had all that stuff, you know, the Cambridge spies. and all that. With this, what does one say? It's just there. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> How Irish is it? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> In language it is. The house that Cleave's in was on the square that I was born in, that's south-east Ireland. I suppose to be cheaply Freudian about it, I suppose I was going back again, which is what one always does. Baudelaire said: 'Genius consisted of being able to summon up childhood at will.' I think this is true. </p> <p>If you look at a poet like Wordsworth, I mean, he lost childhood and he ceased to be a poet because he couldn't do that any more. I think that going back - what is it about the past? I can never understand it. Why is it so powerful? Why does it appeal to us as if it had some extraordinary pearl of meaning that we can't find in our present lives? I mean, what is this? </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> It's the historical gene - this will make significance of ourselves. </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> When I look at my life, it only began to be interesting when I got to the age of about 17, 18, 19. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Before that's a sort of soup, isn't it? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> And yet it's that soup that I keep going back to, as if I can find something in it. Is this self-deluded or is it something that novelists use? Do we say the soup must be valuable, we must keep this stuff, we must keep going back and plunging into it? I don't understand it. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> When you were growing up, what did you read? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> I read the English novelists. The Untouchable was a big acknowledgement to people like Waugh and P.G. Wodehouse. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Not the Irish writers? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> I read them as well. The people that I remember - I mean, I started reading Wodehouse when I was 11. I remember asking my brother, who's eight years older than me. I said: 'What's a novel? There are cowboy books and detective books, what else is there?' He said: 'Well, there are novels about life.' Wodehouse is very interesting. There must be all kinds of darknesses in that man's life. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Do you see yourself in the Irish tradition as a writer? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> In terms of language, yes. Irish English is a very different beast from English English or American English. Very different. The way in which Irish writers are only too happy to infuse their language with ambiguity is very different. An English writer will try to be clear. Orwell said that good prose should be like a pane of glass. The Irish writer would say: 'No no, it's a lens, it distorts everything.' </p> <p>You see, the odd thing is that the Irish language died in the 1840s but we still have that deep grammar inside us and it still dictates. The Irish language is an incredibly oblique language. It doesn't say things straightforwardly. Everything is expressed in a very oblique way. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> You can't say yes or no in Irish </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> Well, you can't say I'm a man. You have to say something like, 'I'm in my manliness'. You can't make a direct statement. English was a language that was given to us, imposed on us by the English. Like Latin, it was designed to give orders. It was a purely technical language. This has composed a mind-set that's used to complete obliquity and produces this extraordinary literary language. </p> <p>If you look at Joyce, or even Yeats, who seems to be making declarative statements, he's always ambiguous. Ambiguity is the essence of Irish writing, I think. At least it was up until now. Maybe it's changing now. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Do you feel at home in that and see yourself as being in that tradition? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> Oh absolutely, yes. But I don't see myself as expressing Irish concerns. It's a pity that the novel doesn't any more really address itself to social concerns, certainly not the European novel. The American novel does. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Seamus Heaney has written about the Troubles and the predicament of being Irish, but you've never addressed that question, have you? </p> <p> <strong> JB: </strong> Well, it depends how you do it. I realised many years after I had written it that The Book of Evidenc e was, in many ways, about Ireland because it was about the failure of imagination and the failure to imagine other people into existence. </p> <p>You can only plant a bomb in Omagh main street if the people walking around in the street are not really human. And what happened in Ireland in the last 30 years was a great failure of the imagination. But I didn't set out to do that in the book, but we're never free of our time. We like to think we are but we're not.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Patrice Wymore, the relict of Errol Flynn, complained recently of the lack of elegance in Jamaica. Announcing her decision to put her seaside plantation on the market for a handsome \u00a333 million, she explained: 'I'm not abandoning this place for some holiday chain to vandalise. It's a crying shame how glamour has vanished, so only someone who agrees to my plans can have it.' The plans include a polo ground, a world-class golf course and villas. </p> <p>Well, while not wishing to gainsay the redoubtable Mrs Flynn, who has, after all, lived on the island since the late Forties, I don't think she really need be quite so doom-laden about Jamaica's prospects. For there is always the equally redoubtable figure of Chris Blackwell, heir of one of Jamaica's oldest families, founder of Island Records and a man who clearly likes to promote the notion of luxurious living. </p> <p>The hotels that comprise his Island Outpost group, which includes properties in Florida and the Bahamas as well as Jamaica, are founded on the principle that small but beautiful is best. </p> <p>First stop is the Caves at Negril. Turn left out of Montego Bay and keep driving. It's actually only a two-and-a-half-hour drive, but as this journey is along a road that loses nothing in comparison with the very worst roads in the middle of Iceland, you arrive with a severe case of 'Jamaica arse', having been bucked up and down, side to side, front to back.

      "bodyText": "Patrice Wymore, the relict of Errol Flynn, complained recently of the lack of elegance in Jamaica. Announcing her decision to put her seaside plantation on the market for a handsome \u00a333 million, she explained: 'I'm not abandoning this place for some holiday chain to vandalise. It's a crying shame how glamour has vanished, so only someone who agrees to my plans can have it.' The plans include a polo ground, a world-class golf course and villas. Well, while not wishing to gainsay the redoubtable Mrs Flynn, who has, after all, lived on the island since the late Forties, I don't think she really need be quite so doom-laden about Jamaica's prospects. For there is always the equally redoubtable figure of Chris Blackwell, heir of one of Jamaica's oldest families, founder of Island Records and a man who clearly likes to promote the notion of luxurious living. The hotels that comprise his Island Outpost group, which includes properties in Florida and the Bahamas as well as Jamaica, are founded on the principle that small but beautiful is best. First stop is the Caves at Negril. Turn left out of Montego Bay and keep driving. It's actually only a two-and-a-half-hour drive, but as this journey is along a road that loses nothing in comparison with the very worst roads in the middle of Iceland, you arrive with a severe case of 'Jamaica arse', having been bucked up and down, side to side, front to back.

But in his own way he promises to fight for Scottish independence.</p> <p>Unless there is an enormous upset, he seems certain to be acclaimed leader of the SNP in succession to Alex Salmond at the party conference in Inverness on Saturday.</p> <p>Swinney, 36, is a gradualist. He hopes to achieve independence by building the trust of the Scottish people both in its new Parliament and in his party. And, perhaps conscious of Salmond's reputation as a 'one-man band', he promises to build a broad-based team to carry out the task.</p> <p>Between him and his rival for the leadership, Alex Neil, 49, there is not much ideological ground. Both subscribe to the centre-left consensus in which, Swinney says, the SNP is firmly anchored.</p> <p>But on strategy there is an enormous gulf. Neil dismisses devolution as a Unionist honey trap designed to suck the SNP into acquiescence with the Union; Swinney believes it opens the road to independence. Swinney explains: 'I find it inconceivable to see how independence could be built out of the failure of the Scottish Parliament. I just can't see how that would happen. What we have to do is build on the foundations that have been laid.'</p> <p>He recognises that the Parliament is an incomplete institution, with limited powers, and that in its first year it got off to a very bad start. The early rows about holidays and commemorative medals were 'disastrous'. But still he believes that the Parliament was the 'biggest mistake the Unionists have made'.</p> <p>He explains: 'It signalled to me an admission of failure for the United Kingdom. If the UK was a great success for Scotland, we wouldn't need this Parliament. From my perspective as a Scottish Nationalist, that's a great shot in the arm.'</p> <p>Swinney asserts that the existence of the Parliament has carried the whole debate about independence much further forward and given the SNP, the main party of opposition, a much higher profile.</p> <p>'The public can now see an institution that could have a whole range of powers added to it - fiscal powers, direct representation in Europe, control over social security and macroeconomic policy. They can see how all that could come together within an independent Scottish Parliament.'</p> <p>But he admits that there is a serious problem in the public's perception of the new Parliament, because it is confusing the 'fiascos' of the Executive - run by the ruling Labour/Lib Dem coalition - with those of the Parliament itself. 'That is a distinction we're going to make time after time after time, to make sure the Parliament does not pay the price of the Executive's failures.'</p> <p>He believes that the Scottish Parliament has done some very good work in its committees and has flexed its muscles once or twice. 'But what I think is corrosive is the coalition Executive's determination to run this place just like Westminster.'</p> <p>One of his frustrations as a Westminster MP (for South Tayside) was that he didn't feel the power of argument ever won the day. 'I'm beginning to get the same feeling here, and that's very frustrating. That's not what the people of Scotland voted for - they voted for the arguments to win the day.'</p> <p>One of the weak points of the Parliament, he adds, is that it is run by a majority Executive which is a 'fix, not a genuine meeting of minds'.</p> <p>The Lib Dems will 'pay a hell of a price and the people who'll pay it will be their Westminster MPs. They have lost a great deal of support. By and large they have always been respected as people who set out their views, but here they've just tumbled over. It's not just what they've gone along with, but how they've done that.'</p> <p>Labour, too, he believes, is vulnerable to the SNP. 'There are a number of questions to be asked about what Scottish Labour MPs actually do. Are they really standing up for Scotland? Where have they been on the fuel tax issue? Where are the queues of Labour MPs standing up saying this is unjust, unfair and punitive taxation? There's a deafening silence'.</p> <p>And is there any longer a role for the Secretary of State for Scotland, who represents the Scottish interest in Cabinet? 'No. I cannot imagine what he does with his time. And I have no idea what the Minister of State [Brian Wilson] does with his time either.'</p> <p>He acknowledges that the fuel crisis showed just how inter-dependent the world has become. What place for nationalism then? 'It's just as important as ever it was'.</p> <p>The SNP believes in the sovereign right of the Scottish people to make choices - for example, about whether they want to be part of the European Union. He is an enthusiast for the euro, which he believes would produce more suitable conditions for the Scottish economy than present policies determined by conditions in the South-East. But he is against tax harmonisation because this would lead to a European superstate, which he opposes.</p> <p>Swinney grew up in Edinburgh and became attracted to the SNP as a schoolboy during the heady second general election of 1974 when it won 30 per cent of the vote and 11 seats. He remembers his profound irritation when commentators described the swimmer David Wilkie as British when he triumphed at the Commonwealth Games but Scottish when he did not. He joined the party after being 'gutted' by the failure of the 1979 referendum to produce home rule.</p> <p>He is known as a consensualist and is liked by most of his political opponents. But he insists he is no soft touch. 'I'd be concerned if my opponents didn't think I was a nice person, a courteous person. But I fight very, very hard for my politics. I'm proud of my reputation as someone who can build consensus, because I think that's what the SNP needs. It needs somebody who can bring people together very effectively.'</p> <p>He continues: 'I'm determined to bring in a range of people clearly seen as representing the SNP. If I have one ambition about the SNP leadership, it is that I preside over a team of very well known people who are trusted and viewed as credible individuals to lead Scotland to independence.'</p> <p>During the campaign he has, he reckons, talked to more than 2,500 party members. He is 'working very hard to win' but is taking nothing for granted. And one senses that, despite his talk of a broad-based leadership, he does not in any sense intend to make it a collective. Swinney means to take charge.</p> <p>He says: 'If I am elected I want everyone in the SNP to move ahead together and with a clean slate. There will be no question of me presiding over an exclusive leadership. One of my strengths is in building a team. I am all for open debate about issues within the SNP, but once we have come to our conclusions, we must speak with one clear voice.'</p>",

In our English-speaking former colony, the red telephone boxes are exactly the same as the London ones. The Queen still reigns. The policemen have 'ER' badges on their caps, more than matching the British bobby for smartness, right down to the black, shiny boots. </p> <p>Despite the old horrors of empire and sugar plantations, the 95,000 islanders have a great affinity with the Brits and the Irish. When I went there on a windsurfing holiday in a party of about 30, everyone was impressed with the place. </p> <p>Grenada could be the world capital of beautiful, pale sandy beaches bordering on to gentle turquoise seas. Its tiny area - 20 miles long and 12 miles wide - is also home to small rainforests, Hollywood-style waterfalls and Mount Qua Qua, the volcanic crater-turned-lake. </p> <p>If your tastes also run to Guinness and cricket, you will probably never want to leave the so-called 'Spice Island'.

      "bodyText": "Imagine a Britain with sunshine nearly every day- a Britain so warm that palm trees grow on the edge of all beaches. Discounting the effects of global warming, the closest you can probably get to this Britannic idyll is by making the nine-hour air journey to Grenada in the Caribbean. In our English-speaking former colony, the red telephone boxes are exactly the same as the London ones. The Queen still reigns. The policemen have 'ER' badges on their caps, more than matching the British bobby for smartness, right down to the black, shiny boots. Despite the old horrors of empire and sugar plantations, the 95,000 islanders have a great affinity with the Brits and the Irish. When I went there on a windsurfing holiday in a party of about 30, everyone was impressed with the place. Grenada could be the world capital of beautiful, pale sandy beaches bordering on to gentle turquoise seas. Its tiny area - 20 miles long and 12 miles wide - is also home to small rainforests, Hollywood-style waterfalls and Mount Qua Qua, the volcanic crater-turned-lake. If your tastes also run to Guinness and cricket, you will probably never want to leave the so-called 'Spice Island'.

      "body": "<p>The truck roared past, leaving a trail of dust billowing up into the palm trees. In its wake lay a tiny brown speck - a kitten, not more than a few weeks old. I ran over, picked it up and placed it out of the heat of the midday sun. What were we to do? The road was deserted and even though it was unhurt I didn't give much for its chances without its mother's protection. 'Come on, it's coming with us,' said my wife. </p> <p>'But we're going to the beach,' I protested. 'Cats don't sit on the beach.' </p> <p>'We'll talk to Sunshine,' she said. 'He'll know what to do.' </p> <p>So, with the kitten purring in my wife's handbag, we turned off the road and made for the beach and Sunshine's Bar. </p> <p>We were heading for Pinneys, the finest stretch of sand on the tiny Caribbean island of Nevis (pronounced 'neevis'). God had a good day when he created this beach, fringing its four miles with coconut palms, sprinkling it with golden sand and speckling its warm waters with pelicans. </p> <p>Sunshine, dreadlocks swinging to the reggae beat of his sound system, greeted us in his friendly, laconic manner. </p> <p>'What have you got there?' he asked, as the kitten popped its head out of the handbag and mewed. 'A cat. I could use a cat. I've got mice at home. Tell me,' he asked, as though these things are subject to the vagaries of fashion, 'what do cats eat nowadays?' </p> <p>We assured him that the fish and lobster on his menu would suit very nicely and so the kitten, hastily named Nisbet by my wife on the path down to the beach, found a new home. (Fanny Nisbet married the young Horatio Nelson on Nevis in 1787; Nisbet seemed a suitably neutral name, kitten sexing not being our forte). </p> <p>It only occurred to me later that Nevis might have been a better name. The image of a helpless kitten is a metaphor for the Caribbean islands; lost amid the vastness of the oceans, subject to the vagaries of cruel nature, entirely at the mercy of mankind, yet undeniably beautiful. </p> <p>Nature has dealt out more than a fair share of cruelty to the Caribbean in the past 10 years. Hurricanes are a way of life here, but there has been an increase in their frequency and ferocity and Nevis, like other islands, has suffered. Traditionally, the great storms come from the Atlantic, roaring over the sparsely populated and bleaker eastern shoreline, but last year was different. Hurricane Lenny screamed in from the Caribbean, swooping down on the western shore, piling up the sand on Pinneys beach and, crucially, smashing up the Four Seasons hotel, the largest and most prestigious venue on the island. As soon as word hit the US that the Four Seasons had been wrecked, Nevis was effectively written off as a tourist destination, so Lenny was a double disaster for its 10,000 inhabitants; their homes were damaged and their income cut. </p> <p>Except, of course, Nevis hadn't closed for business. Its other hotels were quickly back, particularly the plantation inns. The sugar planters of the eighteenth century knew a thing or two about the weather and were careful to plant up and away from the shoreline, so the Hermitage, Montpelier and Golden Rock plantations weren't bothered by Lenny. </p> <p>It is these graceful, elegant buildings that hold the key to today's Caribbean. For nearly 200 years they relied totally on slaves to tend their crops, and most of the Nevisian population descended from the Africans who were forced here in a triangular trade that saw sugar sent to England, manufactured goods to Africa and slaves to the Caribbean. When, in 1834, emancipation came, 7,225 slaves were freed, an event that is still celebrated here on the first Monday in August. Black people had the same rights as whites and every freed slave acquired a new surname. Most chose to take their previous masters', which gives rise to some startling names today. </p> <p>Tyrone O'Flaherty is Permanent Secretary for Tourism. He is in no doubt where the future for Nevis lies. 'We cater for the upper end of the tourist trade - the highly discriminating tourist. We won't have casino tourism here,' he said, in the cool of his air-conditioned office. The night before I had heard rumours of a second Four Seasons-style hotel being planned. He waved these suggestions away with talk of approaches from several companies, surveys and environmental considerations, but he did not dismiss the idea entirely, which will alarm some of the plantation inn owners, who see another big hotel (Four Seasons has 196 rooms) as a threat to their business and to the infrastructure on this 36-square-mile island. </p> <p>And what about the fish farm rumour? Nevis, with neighbouring St Kitts, is the western hemisphere's smallest nation state and as such has a vote at the UN, a vote the Norwegians and Japanese would value on the Whaling Commission. I had heard that the Norwegians had come with the not altogether altruistic offer to build a fish farm on the island. What on earth, I asked O'Flaherty, did an island surrounded with thousands of miles of ocean, need with a fish farm? Nothing had been decided, I was assured. Somehow it's difficult to imagine why anyone should wish to get involved in politics in such idyllic surroundings, but when people's livelihoods depend on the natural beauty and temperate climate of a tiny island everything becomes political. </p> <p>Opposition spokesman Hastings Daniel was refreshingly direct. He would have no truck with a fish farm. He would want a power station. </p> <p>The moon spread a carpet of silver over the dark Caribbean as we settled on the terrace at Golden Rock inn to hear the Honeybees, Nevis's oldest-established band. Its locally-made instruments include a fife, banjo, quako (four-stringed guitar), steel drum and an instrument called a baho, which used to be a hollowed out tree trunk until someone discovered that a length of plastic down-pipe serves just as well. </p> <p>Over dinner Pam Barry, who runs Golden Rock, explained that the former plantation cookhouse used to belong to her grandfather who was island doctor (as Fanny Nisbet's first husband had been a century before him). She had grown to love the island and its people in the 30 years she had been there, but was tired of four-legged litter louts. The sugar plantations used donkeys for transport and now the island had hundreds of their unemployed descendants wandering untethered, tearing open rubbish bags and scattering the contents along the roadside. Strangely, they are particularly active on a Saturday night. </p> <p>Everyone seems to have an opinion on the 'donkey problem' but no one appears to have a solution. When a cull was suggested, large numbers of overseas Nevisians put a stop to it, protesting - at a distance - at the destruction of their heritage. </p> <p>Much more entertaining than the donkeys, however, are the green vervet monkeys that live on the slopes of Mount Nevis. From the windows of our cottage in the grounds of the Hermitage we would see whole families come tumbling down to steal mangoes in the early morning, while on our balcony a bright yellow banaquit honeycreeper was vainly trying to build a nest in a lantern. </p> <p>Irridescent humming birds, great brown pelicans, beautiful frigate birds; Nevis seems blessed with birdlife, most of it happy to come within a few feet of the pool or beach, so that Peter Evans's Birds of the Eastern Caribbean became as much a part of our reading as our holiday fiction. </p> <p>While Nevis and the other Caribbean islands have long been independent they retain a colonial air, felt most strongly in the plantation inns. The Hermitage dates from 1740 and is the oldest wooden house still in use in the Caribbean (Nelson would have known it). Tea and cakes are served every afternoon; drinks before dinner have a club atmosphere. We found the same at Montpelier and Golden Rock; discreet charm, a sense of history, a sense of occasion. </p> <p>By contrast the Mount Nevis Hotel and Beach Club is a modern development, commanding stunning views across the sound to St Kitts. It must have one of the finest vistas from a swimming pool anywhere in the world, but to call it a Beach Club is a little misleading; the beach is a 10-minute drive from the hotel. Still, the standard of the expensive cuisine more than makes up for any disappointment. </p> <p> One morning we set out to climb up into the rainforest around Mount Nevis with Lynell, a tall, charismatic Nevisian who kept up a constant commentary on the flora and fauna while explaining life on the island. Like a lot of young Nevisians he left to work in the US and has returned to give something back to his homeland. He voiced a lot of the frustrations felt by his contemporaries. 'My green employment card in the US said I was a resident alien. I'm not an alien. That's for UFOs. This is a breadfruit tree planted here at Golden Rock by Captain Bligh; the wood of this white cedar makes excellent cricket bats. When I was a kid we couldn't afford cricket bats. We would play with the thick, hardened part of the coconut palm leaf and with a ball made from a crushed milk can covered with a tyre inner-tube; be careful of that one, ma'am, that's the stinking weed. Made into a tea it stops bed wetting. That's not to be confused with stinging nettle tea - that induces labour. </p> <p>'Now don't stand under these big coconut palms. A falling coconut is very dangerous. Kids nowadays don't know how to climb these things. Do you know that 2,000 Nevisians are living abroad at the moment? That's a brain drain. We need those people back here.' Now, he should go into politics. </p> <p>We were struck by how silent it was as we climbed higher. 'Ten years of hurricanes have made the forest quiet,' said Lynell, pointing out the trumpet tree, whose leaves turn white when a hurricane is approaching - a natural early-warning system. The pathway narrowed and we clung to branches to prevent ourselves tumbling down the steep mountainside, but it was never dangerous. Not that everyone would agree. 'Sylvester Stallone booked to come on this walk the last time he was staying at Four Seasons,' said Lynell. 'But he cancelled when it rained.' Apparently the star of all those Rocky movies thought the path would be too slippery. </p> <p> Stephen Pritchard travelled to Nevis as a guest of the Nevis Tourist Office, JMC Airlines and Nevis Express </p> <p> <strong>Nevis factfile</strong></p> <p><strong> Population</strong> 10,000. <br> <strong> Capital </strong> Charlestown. <br> <strong> Currency</strong> Eastern Caribbean and US dollars </p> <p><strong> Getting there </strong><br> BA, Virgin, BWIA and JMC fly London-Antigua (23-minute air transfer to Nevis) JMC also flies London-St Kitts (six- minute air transfer to Nevis). </p> <p> <strong>Places to stay</strong></p> <p> <strong> The Hermitage</strong> Charming collection of 12 classic Nevisian colonial cottages, each with huge canopy beds and private balconies, set in beautiful grounds around the old main house. <br> Tel 001 869 469 3477/fax 469 2481. email: nevherm@caribsurf.com <a href=\"http://www.hermitagenevis.com\">www.hermitagenevis.com</a> </p> <p> <strong> Montpelier Plantation Inn</strong> 17-room former sugar plantation house, set in 12 acres of gardens, ranked number one in the Caribbean by Conde Nast Traveler .

There was a rebellion by other guests at our crumbling, all-inclusive hotel. Anyone who refused to join in was branded a 'scab' by the Liverpudlian ringleader.

While my wife, Sue, slept off the rigours of a British Airways Club Class flight (grilled turbot followed by a cheese board of stilton, accompanied by a cheeky - nay, impertinent - little 1996 Claret), I went to test the water of our beach front hotel.

'Any bad habits, man?' he asked. </p> <p>I thought about telling him to pull up a chair and boring him with tales of orgies and drink and drug abuse, hoping he would think I was a nutter and put the word out to the other touts to give me a wide berth. </p> <p>Instead, I smiled and said: 'Not at the moment.'

The north of the island has big cliffs, which the sea crashes into, sending waves into the air. The east coast was our favourite.

      "body": "<p>The site of an acrimonious three-way struggle that autumn between Blair, Brown and Mandelson was the Post Office, the future of which was a litmus test of New Labour's attitude towards the public sector. Blair was eager for the Post Office to be privatised. Mandelson, who suffered a rough ride from the trade unions and the party over the issue, finally nudged the Prime Minister away from the idea. It would be hard to reconcile with their manifesto pledge to keep it in state hands, and Mandelson believed he had hit upon a 'Third Way' compromise. He proposed giving the Post Office more commercial freedom. This satisfied Blair, but it attracted the contempt of Brown. The Chancellor regarded Mandelson's plan as intellectually feeble and a costly fudge. The Treasury would lose part of its revenue stream without gaining any of the proceeds of a privatisation. Mandelson appealed to No 10, asking Blair to throw his weight into the wrestling match with Brown. Prime Minister and Chancellor had one of their most murderous arguments. A witness describes it as 'a foetus-position row', meaning everyone else present hunched themselves into a ball until the storm blew over. Blair's decision was doubly aggravating to Brown. Not only did the Chancellor resent being overruled, he acted even more the wounded bull-elephant because Blair had taken Mandelson's side.</p> <p>There is no politician who enjoys losing an argument. Few react to being frustrated with such dark wrath as Gordon Brown. When the Post Office scheme was announced, Charlie Whelan, Brown's press officer, gave a brutal and barely disguised briefing against Mandelson. He had 'bottled out' of making a tough decision and come up with a 'dog's breakfast'. Ad hominem abuse against senior members of the Cabinet was far from without precedent from the Chancellor's megaphone, but Whelan was setting a new standard of brazenness. Mandelson, supported by Campbell, urged Blair to force Brown to sack Whelan.</p> <p>'I'll get rid of him by the end of the year,' Blair replied, a pledge to which they reacted with knowing laughter. They had heard this sort of declaration so frequently that they no longer placed any faith in it. Blair's repeated failures to make Brown dispense with the vexatious Whelan had turned the Prime Minister into a butt of ridicule among his own intimates. Jonathan Powell, Anji Hunter and Alastair Campbell would mock Blair to his face about it. 'He'll be gone by Easter. He'll be gone by the summer. He'll be gone by Christmas,' they would torment Blair, taunting him with reminders of how often he had assured them he would deal with Whelan and how he had as frequently failed. Blair responded with a pained frown and a feeble insistence: 'I could get rid of him. I just don't work like that.' This was, on the face of it, a remarkable situation. Here was Tony Blair, reputedly equal in power to Margaret Thatcher in her pomp. This titan of No 10 could not remove a mere press officer. That makes it sound more straightforward than it was. For Blair to insist would mean full-frontal combat with Brown, an incendiary conflict that he was shy risking. The Prime Minister was scared of provoking the Chancellor.</p> <p>Whelan himself was arriving at the conclusion that his days were numbered. He shared with friends ideas about quitting the Treasury of his own volition to pursue a career as a journalist. But it would be out of character for Whelan to depart gently into the night; if he was going, he had the means to take Mandelson with him. He confided to one journalist that there was a 'thermonuclear device under Peter and it's primed to go off in January'. This was the \u00a3373,000 soft loan Geoffrey Robinson had given to Mandelson, before the election and before they moved into warring camps, to purchase his \u00a3475,000 house in west London. Whelan had the means of detonating this sensational information into the public domain. A biography of Mandelson, due for publication in the New Year, was being written by Paul Routledge, who shared Whelan's dedication to Brown and the intensity of his hatred for Mandelson.</p> <p>Mandelson was not oblivious to the danger. He even asked Blair to intercede with Brown to prevent publication. 'I can do nothing about it,' Brown told Blair, and it is highly unlikely the Chancellor could have done, even if he had wanted to.</p> <p>With or without the book, Geoffrey's largesse to Peter was a story begging to see the light of day. Mandelson's secret loan was hugely threatening to him, not least because it was not a secret to several of his enemies. Apart from Charlie Whelan, Ed Balls knew. Brown himself had known about it for a long time. The existence of the loan became known to the Chancellor's closest friend in the Cabinet, Nick Brown, who shared his feelings towards Mandelson. An embittered Robinson was fed up to the point of resignation after being hounded by the media. He was also sour that the ungrateful Mandelson hadn't even invited him to the house-warming party.</p> <p>The secret loan was becoming increasingly less secret, at least within the inner, incestuous circles of New Labour. Michael Wills, the MP for Swindon North, knew. Though a Brownite, he managed to be on amicable terms with a man very close to the Prime Minister. Wills was an old university chum of Charlie Falconer, who had shared a flat in Wandsworth, south London, with Blair when they were both young lawyers. Blair, having failed to secure a seat in the Commons for Falconer, had placed him in the Lords, first as Solicitor-General, and then as number two at the Cabinet Office. That August, Michael Wills and Charlie Falconer, finding themselves holidaying near to each other in Malaga, southern Spain, got together. Wills passed on word of Mandelson's loan. Sworn to a confidence, and not thinking it his place to raise it with Blair, Falconer kept the secret to himself. So Falconer, that best of chums, knew. Brown long knew. Extraordinarily, the one person who had been kept in a state of complete ignorance was the Prime Minister.</p> <p>When, in conversation, Blair made references to 'your flat', Mandelson huffily replied: 'It's a house actually.' Recklessly, he encouraged media interest in 9 Northumberland Place. Vogue was invited chez Mandelson, where Lord Snowdon photographed him posing in the \u00a31,800 tanned leather Balzac chair. The house was given a self-consciously chic \u00a350,000 make-over by a top-of-the-range interior designer. Original features were stripped out to turn it into a shrine of soulless minimalism. It was as if he couldn't stop himself providing the critics with metaphors for what he had helped do to the Labour Party. Campbell occasionally ragged Mandelson about how exactly he had afforded a house worth 10 times an MP's salary. 'Where did you get the money then, Peter?' Campbell baited him. Mandelson never gave a straight answer, but implied to Campbell, as he did to others, that the money had come from his mother. Various explanations were later advanced for why the great strategist had placed himself in the perilous position of concealing this lethal loan from his friends when it was known to his enemies. Was he socially embarrassed? Did he genuinely think it was not anyone else's business? Could he believe that his secret would remain for ever safe with Gordon Brown and his acolytes? Sometimes the simple explanation is the correct answer. According to one of his closest friends, Mandelson concealed the loan because 'Peter knew what he had done was wrong'. Another person who has known Mandelson for many years says: 'He was ashamed to admit it to Tony.'</p> <p>Public shame loomed by early December. The proof copy of Routledge's book was inadvertently sent to the wrong office at the Commons, where it was read by another journalist. There was a tip-off to Mandelson's aide, Ben Wegg-Prosser, young, gently spoken, bespectacled, and sometimes known as Oofy, after the Wodehouse character. By Tuesday 15 December, Wegg-Prosser was aware that exposure was imminent. Not wanting to destabilise his boss until he had finished presenting a White Paper on competition, the aide left it until Wednesday evening to tell Mandelson. He had no choice now but to confess the secret to No 10. Unable to face telling Blair, Mandelson got Wegg-Prosser to ring Alastair Campbell to tell Downing Street about the loan and that it would shortly become public.</p> <p>Tony Blair was in his study that Thursday lunchtime working on the statement he would give to the Commons in the afternoon about military action against Iraq. He had less than two hours to find the appropriate words to announce his first act of war as Prime Minister. Campbell knew that Blair did not want to be interrupted. But what he had just learnt from Wegg-Prosser would produce far more explosive headlines than the munitions raining on Saddam Hussein. The press secretary rushed to the Prime Minister to give him the bones of what Campbell would later characterise as this 'big, bad story'. At first, Blair struggled to muster coherent sentences to express his shock. Then, anger at Mandelson's stupidity transferred itself to fury with the messenger.</p> <p>'Why the fuck are you landing this on me now?' he demanded of Campbell. 'Because it can't fucking wait,' Campbell retorted. 'We have to decide what we are going to do, how we are going to handle it.' As the awfulness of the implications began to sink in, Blair turned to wondering who else had been concealing this timebomb.</p> <p>Did Anji Hunter know? She was on friendly terms with Robinson. She was also a pal of Wegg-Prosser. Blair called her in. She could immediately tell something was badly wrong. Blair looked terrible. 'Did you know?' he demanded aggressively. 'What?' said Hunter. 'That Peter took a loan from Geoffrey for his house.' She felt faint and sat down. 'No, honestly, Tony. Christ! If I'd known, I would have told you.' How big, she asked, was the loan? 'Oh, God,' Blair shook his head in despair. 'Hundreds of thousands of pounds.' Hunter phoned Wegg-Prosser to berate him for not confiding in her. 'Why did you never tell us?' she shouted. 'I couldn't. He swore me to secrecy. I kept telling Peter,' replied a tremulous Wegg-Prosser. 'I kept telling him he couldn't keep it secret. He wouldn't listen.'</p> <p>It is a tribute to Blair's ability to mentally compartmentalise that he could confidently pronounce on Iraq in the Commons that afternoon while the loan crisis was consuming his mind. It was an illustration of how angry, aghast and anxious he was that, even while heavily engaged in presenting and presiding over the action against Iraq, he devoted attention to Mandelson.</p> <p>Mandelson slipped into No 10 under cover of darkness at the end of the week to face a bleakly furious Blair. 'Jesus Christ, Peter! What a misjudgment,' Blair raged. The man who was supposed to be so well equipped with political savvy had shown a catastrophic lack of it. Worse, complained Blair, Mandelson had treated him, his friend and Prime Minister, as a dupe. Mandelson pleaded that he did not believe he had done anything 'fundamentally wrong'. This was not Blair's angriest grievance. Mandelson's selfishness and vanity had betrayed him and their project. Everything they had worked for was imperilled. For not only was Blair shocked, he was fearful. He and those closest to him were already mentally writing the headlines which would be used against New Labour by its enemies within and without.</p> <p>The Prime Minister's press secretary vented his personal rage even more fiercely. The full heat of Campbell's flame-thrower temper was turned on him. To his face, Campbell told Mandelson he had been a 'stupid cunt'. The violence of these reactions is understandable. Everyone feels it most acutely when they are let down by their friends.</p> <p>Blair talked to Mandelson again on Saturday, by which time his mind was turning to what might be done to contain the damage. He told Mandelson to get rid of the loan as rapidly as possible. Paying it off before it became public knowledge might improve the chances of constructing some sort of defence. But Blair was already sceptical that Mandelson could be saved.</p> <p>The mysterious financing of Mandelson's mansion had attracted the interest of several journalists, among them the Guardian's David Hencke, an award-winning investigator of political scandal. After months of truffling, Hencke's assiduity had not been rewarded with the story. Then he got what must have looked like an amazing break. In early December, Hencke received a call from a source he had dealt with before on anti-Mandelson stories. The reporter met this informant on Tuesday 8 December at a most unusual location where both Hencke and his source could be certain they would not be seen by other journalists or politicians. They met at a greasy spoon in the West End. The source did not have the precise figure, but revealed to the reporter the Mandelson home loan from Robinson. They met again at the same greasy spoon six days later, on 14 December, this time with another Guardian reporter present, when the source added the fascinating detail that the solicitor who handled the purchasing of the house was Wegg-Prosser's father. Hencke's source was a senior politician closely associated with Gordon Brown. The motive for priming Hencke was twofold: using another conduit might shield Whelan from being fingered as the source; and the Brown camp, suspecting that Mandelson knew exposure was imminent, may have feared that he would find some way of suppressing or minimising the impact of the story.</p> <p>How complicit was Gordon Brown in the immolation of his fellow Minister and founder of New Labour? Another member of the innermost circle, who has known Brown for more than a decade, says: 'Gordon is absolutely capable of it.' Even if the Chancellor did not pull the trigger, he knew it was being squeezed. Whether or not he gave the precise instruction to strike against Mandelson, Brown willed the act.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,369241,00.html\">Extract three: The house comes tumbling down</a></p>",

Mandelson appealed to No 10, asking Blair to throw his weight into the wrestling match with Brown. Prime Minister and Chancellor had one of their most murderous arguments. A witness describes it as 'a foetus-position row', meaning everyone else present hunched themselves into a ball until the storm blew over. Blair's decision was doubly aggravating to Brown. Not only did the Chancellor resent being overruled, he acted even more the wounded bull-elephant because Blair had taken Mandelson's side. There is no politician who enjoys losing an argument. Few react to being frustrated with such dark wrath as Gordon Brown. When the Post Office scheme was announced, Charlie Whelan, Brown's press officer, gave a brutal and barely disguised briefing against Mandelson. He had 'bottled out' of making a tough decision and come up with a 'dog's breakfast'. Ad hominem abuse against senior members of the Cabinet was far from without precedent from the Chancellor's megaphone, but Whelan was setting a new standard of brazenness. Mandelson, supported by Campbell, urged Blair to force Brown to sack Whelan. 'I'll get rid of him by the end of the year,' Blair replied, a pledge to which they reacted with knowing laughter. They had heard this sort of declaration so frequently that they no longer placed any faith in it. Blair's repeated failures to make Brown dispense with the vexatious Whelan had turned the Prime Minister into a butt of ridicule among his own intimates. Jonathan Powell, Anji Hunter and Alastair Campbell would mock Blair to his face about it. 'He'll be gone by Easter. He'll be gone by the summer. He'll be gone by Christmas,' they would torment Blair, taunting him with reminders of how often he had assured them he would deal with Whelan and how he had as frequently failed. Blair responded with a pained frown and a feeble insistence: 'I could get rid of him. I just don't work like that.' This was, on the face of it, a remarkable situation. Here was Tony Blair, reputedly equal in power to Margaret Thatcher in her pomp. This titan of No 10 could not remove a mere press officer. That makes it sound more straightforward than it was. For Blair to insist would mean full-frontal combat with Brown, an incendiary conflict that he was shy risking. The Prime Minister was scared of provoking the Chancellor. Whelan himself was arriving at the conclusion that his days were numbered. He shared with friends ideas about quitting the Treasury of his own volition to pursue a career as a journalist. But it would be out of character for Whelan to depart gently into the night; if he was going, he had the means to take Mandelson with him. He confided to one journalist that there was a 'thermonuclear device under Peter and it's primed to go off in January'. This was the \u00a3373,000 soft loan Geoffrey Robinson had given to Mandelson, before the election and before they moved into warring camps, to purchase his \u00a3475,000 house in west London. Whelan had the means of detonating this sensational information into the public domain. A biography of Mandelson, due for publication in the New Year, was being written by Paul Routledge, who shared Whelan's dedication to Brown and the intensity of his hatred for Mandelson. Mandelson was not oblivious to the danger. He even asked Blair to intercede with Brown to prevent publication. 'I can do nothing about it,' Brown told Blair, and it is highly unlikely the Chancellor could have done, even if he had wanted to. With or without the book, Geoffrey's largesse to Peter was a story begging to see the light of day. Mandelson's secret loan was hugely threatening to him, not least because it was not a secret to several of his enemies. Apart from Charlie Whelan, Ed Balls knew. Brown himself had known about it for a long time. The existence of the loan became known to the Chancellor's closest friend in the Cabinet, Nick Brown, who shared his feelings towards Mandelson. An embittered Robinson was fed up to the point of resignation after being hounded by the media. He was also sour that the ungrateful Mandelson hadn't even invited him to the house-warming party. The secret loan was becoming increasingly less secret, at least within the inner, incestuous circles of New Labour. Michael Wills, the MP for Swindon North, knew. Though a Brownite, he managed to be on amicable terms with a man very close to the Prime Minister. Wills was an old university chum of Charlie Falconer, who had shared a flat in Wandsworth, south London, with Blair when they were both young lawyers. Blair, having failed to secure a seat in the Commons for Falconer, had placed him in the Lords, first as Solicitor-General, and then as number two at the Cabinet Office. That August, Michael Wills and Charlie Falconer, finding themselves holidaying near to each other in Malaga, southern Spain, got together. Wills passed on word of Mandelson's loan. Sworn to a confidence, and not thinking it his place to raise it with Blair, Falconer kept the secret to himself. So Falconer, that best of chums, knew. Brown long knew. Extraordinarily, the one person who had been kept in a state of complete ignorance was the Prime Minister. When, in conversation, Blair made references to 'your flat', Mandelson huffily replied: 'It's a house actually.' Recklessly, he encouraged media interest in 9 Northumberland Place. Vogue was invited chez Mandelson, where Lord Snowdon photographed him posing in the \u00a31,800 tanned leather Balzac chair. The house was given a self-consciously chic \u00a350,000 make-over by a top-of-the-range interior designer. Original features were stripped out to turn it into a shrine of soulless minimalism. It was as if he couldn't stop himself providing the critics with metaphors for what he had helped do to the Labour Party. Campbell occasionally ragged Mandelson about how exactly he had afforded a house worth 10 times an MP's salary. 'Where did you get the money then, Peter?' Campbell baited him. Mandelson never gave a straight answer, but implied to Campbell, as he did to others, that the money had come from his mother. Various explanations were later advanced for why the great strategist had placed himself in the perilous position of concealing this lethal loan from his friends when it was known to his enemies. Was he socially embarrassed? Did he genuinely think it was not anyone else's business? Could he believe that his secret would remain for ever safe with Gordon Brown and his acolytes? Sometimes the simple explanation is the correct answer. According to one of his closest friends, Mandelson concealed the loan because 'Peter knew what he had done was wrong'. Another person who has known Mandelson for many years says: 'He was ashamed to admit it to Tony.' Public shame loomed by early December. The proof copy of Routledge's book was inadvertently sent to the wrong office at the Commons, where it was read by another journalist. There was a tip-off to Mandelson's aide, Ben Wegg-Prosser, young, gently spoken, bespectacled, and sometimes known as Oofy, after the Wodehouse character. By Tuesday 15 December, Wegg-Prosser was aware that exposure was imminent. Not wanting to destabilise his boss until he had finished presenting a White Paper on competition, the aide left it until Wednesday evening to tell Mandelson. He had no choice now but to confess the secret to No 10. Unable to face telling Blair, Mandelson got Wegg-Prosser to ring Alastair Campbell to tell Downing Street about the loan and that it would shortly become public. Tony Blair was in his study that Thursday lunchtime working on the statement he would give to the Commons in the afternoon about military action against Iraq. He had less than two hours to find the appropriate words to announce his first act of war as Prime Minister. Campbell knew that Blair did not want to be interrupted. But what he had just learnt from Wegg-Prosser would produce far more explosive headlines than the munitions raining on Saddam Hussein. The press secretary rushed to the Prime Minister to give him the bones of what Campbell would later characterise as this 'big, bad story'. At first, Blair struggled to muster coherent sentences to express his shock. Then, anger at Mandelson's stupidity transferred itself to fury with the messenger. 'Why the fuck are you landing this on me now?' he demanded of Campbell. 'Because it can't fucking wait,' Campbell retorted. 'We have to decide what we are going to do, how we are going to handle it.' As the awfulness of the implications began to sink in, Blair turned to wondering who else had been concealing this timebomb. Did Anji Hunter know? She was on friendly terms with Robinson. She was also a pal of Wegg-Prosser. Blair called her in. She could immediately tell something was badly wrong. Blair looked terrible. 'Did you know?' he demanded aggressively. 'What?' said Hunter. 'That Peter took a loan from Geoffrey for his house.' She felt faint and sat down. 'No, honestly, Tony. Christ! If I'd known, I would have told you.' How big, she asked, was the loan? 'Oh, God,' Blair shook his head in despair. 'Hundreds of thousands of pounds.' Hunter phoned Wegg-Prosser to berate him for not confiding in her. 'Why did you never tell us?' she shouted. 'I couldn't. He swore me to secrecy. I kept telling Peter,' replied a tremulous Wegg-Prosser. 'I kept telling him he couldn't keep it secret. He wouldn't listen.' It is a tribute to Blair's ability to mentally compartmentalise that he could confidently pronounce on Iraq in the Commons that afternoon while the loan crisis was consuming his mind. It was an illustration of how angry, aghast and anxious he was that, even while heavily engaged in presenting and presiding over the action against Iraq, he devoted attention to Mandelson. Mandelson slipped into No 10 under cover of darkness at the end of the week to face a bleakly furious Blair. 'Jesus Christ, Peter! What a misjudgment,' Blair raged. The man who was supposed to be so well equipped with political savvy had shown a catastrophic lack of it. Worse, complained Blair, Mandelson had treated him, his friend and Prime Minister, as a dupe. Mandelson pleaded that he did not believe he had done anything 'fundamentally wrong'. This was not Blair's angriest grievance. Mandelson's selfishness and vanity had betrayed him and their project. Everything they had worked for was imperilled. For not only was Blair shocked, he was fearful. He and those closest to him were already mentally writing the headlines which would be used against New Labour by its enemies within and without. The Prime Minister's press secretary vented his personal rage even more fiercely. The full heat of Campbell's flame-thrower temper was turned on him. To his face, Campbell told Mandelson he had been a 'stupid cunt'. The violence of these reactions is understandable. Everyone feels it most acutely when they are let down by their friends. Blair talked to Mandelson again on Saturday, by which time his mind was turning to what might be done to contain the damage. He told Mandelson to get rid of the loan as rapidly as possible. Paying it off before it became public knowledge might improve the chances of constructing some sort of defence. But Blair was already sceptical that Mandelson could be saved. The mysterious financing of Mandelson's mansion had attracted the interest of several journalists, among them the Guardian's David Hencke, an award-winning investigator of political scandal. After months of truffling, Hencke's assiduity had not been rewarded with the story. Then he got what must have looked like an amazing break. In early December, Hencke received a call from a source he had dealt with before on anti-Mandelson stories. The reporter met this informant on Tuesday 8 December at a most unusual location where both Hencke and his source could be certain they would not be seen by other journalists or politicians. They met at a greasy spoon in the West End. The source did not have the precise figure, but revealed to the reporter the Mandelson home loan from Robinson. They met again at the same greasy spoon six days later, on 14 December, this time with another Guardian reporter present, when the source added the fascinating detail that the solicitor who handled the purchasing of the house was Wegg-Prosser's father. Hencke's source was a senior politician closely associated with Gordon Brown. The motive for priming Hencke was twofold: using another conduit might shield Whelan from being fingered as the source; and the Brown camp, suspecting that Mandelson knew exposure was imminent, may have feared that he would find some way of suppressing or minimising the impact of the story. How complicit was Gordon Brown in the immolation of his fellow Minister and founder of New Labour? Another member of the innermost circle, who has known Brown for more than a decade, says: 'Gordon is absolutely capable of it.' Even if the Chancellor did not pull the trigger, he knew it was being squeezed. Whether or not he gave the precise instruction to strike against Mandelson, Brown willed the act.

Back at No 10, Derry Irvine and Charlie Falconer, the lawyers of the Blair court, were brought into the discussions with Campbell about how to try to control the loan story. At this meeting, Jonathan Powell produced a note from Sir Richard Wilson. After talking to the DTI's Permanent Secretary Sir Michael Scholar, the Cabinet Secretary confirmed that Mandelson had been properly insulated from the DTI inquiries into Robinson. But both the civil servants also took the view - which Wilson conveyed to Blair - that for Mandelson to be so hugely and secretly indebted to the Paymaster-General was nevertheless 'a very big problem'.</p> <p>On Monday afternoon, the Guardian formally approached Mandelson and Robinson for confirmation of the details of the loan.

The press secretary briefed political correspondents that the Prime Minister did not regard it as 'a hanging offence', which fell far short of a ringing statement of confidence.</p> <p>For the next 24 hours, beginning with Monday's Newsnight, on which he declared, 'There is no conflict of interest so the question of resignation does not arise', Mandelson toured the TV and radio studios, determined to tough it out. As he told one friend: 'I've learnt from my personal life that you have to stand up to these fuckers. If they scent blood, they will come for the kill.'</p> <p>But the more Mandelson talked, the more questions were raised. Should he have declared the loan in the Register of Members' Interests? Had he revealed the loan to the Britannia Building Society when he applied for a mortgage? After a period of equivocation, Mandelson confessed that he had not. Wegg-Prosser was alerted to this deadly question on Monday night during a conversation with Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror. Mandelson's own aide concluded then that his master could not survive. 'Peter's finished,' Wegg-Prosser told one of Blair's aides. 'It's the size of it,' was Blair's private verdict to aides and officials about why the loan was so devastating. For the price of Mandelson's house in an elite enclave of west London could be bought a street of homes in his constituency of Hartlepool.</p> <p>Blair's initial prognosis that Mandelson was not to be saved was hardening by Tuesday morning into a certainty that he had to be severed. Alastair Campbell, thinking the media would never let go until Mandelson resigned, and Anji Hunter, protective of Blair's reputation, were both urging the Prime Minister to dispatch the Trade and Industry Secretary. Blair turned to another confidant for advice. He rang Philip Gould, who was spending Christmas in Jamaica. As warm as the weather was in the Caribbean, Blair's chilly fury transmitted itself down the line. 'Why aren't you here when I need you?' Blair snapped. Gould, while registering Blair's shock and anger, attempted to offer pleas in mitigation. After everything Mandelson had done to create New Labour, should he have his five-month career in the Cabinet terminated? 'You should hold on to Peter. You shouldn't give in to our enemies,' Gould argued. 'If you let Peter go, you'll be weakened.' Blair perceived that, but he saw himself and the Government being more damaged by letting Mandelson hang on. In response to Gould's entreaties to save Mandelson, Blair was stony: 'Look. Read the papers, Philip. Think again.' The phone went down.</p> <p>Blair had retired to Chequers when, at 10 on the night of Tuesday 22 December, he talked again to the man whose skills once so mesmerised him. Blair was not good at breaking bad news. He particularly did not relish telling a friend as old and as close as Mandelson that he wanted him gone. He allowed the other man to lead the conversation, asking for his own assessment. Mandelson still believed himself to be the victim of a 'stitch-up' by the Brownites. The press were 'completely hysterical' and 'out of control'. He had made a mistake, he was prepared to admit that now. Yet he clung to the belief that he could and must remain in the Cabinet.</p> <p>Mandelson did float the idea that he might have to resign. By describing this as 'very painful', he evidently hoped that Blair would respond by dismissing the idea. The words that would have been music for him were the Prime Minister saying that he wasn't going to sacrifice him under pressure from the media, and that the No 10 propaganda organ would be pumped to save him. How Blair replied was therefore a crushing disappointment. He told Mandelson that they should 'sleep on it'. Such an expert reader of the codes of political conversation grasped what Blair was semaphoring. The Prime Minister and those advising him wanted to see the following morning's newspapers before they made a final decision.</p> <p>The press was savage, though not unanimously so. The Guardian, the paper that broke the story, pronounced him guilty of 'more vanity than venality' and judged that resignation would be a sentence out of proportion to the crime. The Sun, which Mandelson once so assiduously courted, had gone down on him. The tabloid shrieked: 'So How The Hell Can Mandy Stay?' There were ironies to be savoured. Among the people whom Mandelson had cultivated was Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of the man who owned the Sun.</p> <p>Even now, a large percentage of Mandelson believed he could yet save his place in the Cabinet. At seven on Wednesday morning he phoned Wegg-Prosser to tell him to organise a 'fight-back' meeting at the DTI with Campbell, his deputy, Lance Price, and Jonathan Powell. Mandelson also talked twice to Gordon Brown. It is an example of the weird convolutions of their relationship that Mandelson turned to the man whom he suspected to have played a large role in precipitating the most traumatic moment of his career. In their first conversation, Brown expressed the view that he should apologise but not resign. Guilt may have been speaking. Mandelson would later come to the conclusion that, while Brown intended to damage, the Chancellor did not expect to destroy him. Anxiety was also informing Brown's reaction. He had reason to fear that, if Mandelson went, all the heat would concentrate on whether he and his coterie had connived to demolish a fellow Minister to the detriment of the Government. An exiled Mandelson would thirst for revenge. When he spoke to Brown for a second time that morning, the Chancellor sombrely rated Mandelson's survival prospects to be much more occluded. By now, Brown had spoken to Blair and discovered how conclusively determined the Prime Minister was to sack Mandelson.</p> <p>The fight-back meeting never happened. At shortly after 10am, Campbell and the others from No 10 arrived in Mandelson's ministerial suite in the DTI tower with its panoramic view of Westminster Abbey. Almost immediately, Campbell ordered everyone else out of the room and into the next door Private Office so that Mandelson could be put through to Blair.</p> <p>Blair was now explicit. The longer Mandelson tried to cling on, the more Mandelson and the Government would be damaged. Mandelson repeatedly asked Blair if that was really his opinion, in an effort to seek out a chink of weakness. That was his view, Blair flatly confirmed, offering the consolation that the quicker he left the Cabinet, the better chance there would be of a reasonably rapid return. By the end of the conversation, tears were trickling down Mandelson's sepulchral white cheeks. A dark-eyed Campbell, himself blubbing, gave Mandelson a hug.</p> <p>Recovering from this lachrymose moment with professional speed, Campbell then wrote a resignation letter for Mandelson and a reply for Blair. Campbell took his compositions to Wegg-Prosser to type up. The wretched Mandelson signed Campbell's draft virtually unaltered, though he first faxed it over to Gordon Brown for him to see. He wanted the Chancellor to taste some of the grief that had been inflicted on him. Blair faxed back Campbell's draft of the Prime Minister's reply with some added personal touches.</p> <p>The Chancellor spread the word among his entourage that their enemy had fallen. Ed Balls and his wife, Yvette Cooper, were on the road, driving to spend Christmas with parents. At precisely the moment that Gordon Brown rang his mobile, Ed and Yvette realised they had forgotten the turkey they were providing for the family Christmas. 'He's gone,' announced Brown. 'We've got to turn back,' Balls said to his wife. 'No, you don't understand. There's no turning back,' said Brown. 'He's resigning at 11 o'clock.'</p> <p>The announcement actually came slightly later, just before the lunchtime news bulletins. Soon after, Robinson was gone as well. Mandelson's resignation missive began: 'I can scarcely believe I am writing this letter...', which was scarcely surprising to those who knew that it had been composed by Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>The swiftness of his departure, and the manner in which it had been dressed up in the resignation letter ghosted by Campbell, succeeded in creating the impression that he had honourably withdrawn to spare the Government prolonged torture at the hands of its opponents. Denis MacShane, the Labour MP for Rotherham, voiced a widely believed platitude: 'Nothing became Peter's holding of high office as the manner of his leaving.' The notion that this was a graceful, selfless sacrifice was deceptive. Peter Mandelson did not fall on his sword. Tony Blair gently, firmly, ruthlessly and necessarily thrust Mandelson on to the blade.</p> <p>Blair's fury was accompanied by a sense of loss. He saw the gaping tear left in the Cabinet. Mandelson had been a Blairite before Blair. He was one of the few who could be called believers in New Labour from more than convenience or sycophancy. There was also the worry for Blair of what a wretchedly depressed Mandelson might do.</p> <p>At around noon on the day of the resignation, the Prime Minister asked Mandelson to Chequers, a characteristically kindly, but also calculating, gesture. It is a sign of the froideur between them that Cherie initiated the call. 'You will always be part of the family,' she told Mandelson. Only when his wife had broken the ice did Blair himself come on the line to say: 'We want you to be with us.' Mandelson and his partner, Reinaldo Avila Da Silva, joined the Blairs' family supper and spent the night. Mandelson was now contrite. 'I know I've done a terrible thing,' he confessed to Blair. 'I've hurt you and I've hurt the Government.' Blair had written out some advice about how to work his passage back: sell the house, get around the constituencies, be a team player. 'For God's sake,' he said to Mandelson. 'Make some friends in the Labour Party.'</p> <p>An ocean of bad blood had been spilt. To the poisonous feud between Brown and Mandelson, and the destabilising rivalry of Blair and Brown, there had now been added a twist to the relationship between Blair and Mandelson. Blair could never again invest quite the same level of trust in Mandelson's judgment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,369245,00.html\">Extract four: How Kosovo strained Blair's 'special relationship'</a></p>",

Almost immediately, Campbell ordered everyone else out of the room and into the next door Private Office so that Mandelson could be put through to Blair. Blair was now explicit. The longer Mandelson tried to cling on, the more Mandelson and the Government would be damaged. Mandelson repeatedly asked Blair if that was really his opinion, in an effort to seek out a chink of weakness. That was his view, Blair flatly confirmed, offering the consolation that the quicker he left the Cabinet, the better chance there would be of a reasonably rapid return. By the end of the conversation, tears were trickling down Mandelson's sepulchral white cheeks. A dark-eyed Campbell, himself blubbing, gave Mandelson a hug. Recovering from this lachrymose moment with professional speed, Campbell then wrote a resignation letter for Mandelson and a reply for Blair. Campbell took his compositions to Wegg-Prosser to type up. The wretched Mandelson signed Campbell's draft virtually unaltered, though he first faxed it over to Gordon Brown for him to see. He wanted the Chancellor to taste some of the grief that had been inflicted on him. Blair faxed back Campbell's draft of the Prime Minister's reply with some added personal touches. The Chancellor spread the word among his entourage that their enemy had fallen. Ed Balls and his wife, Yvette Cooper, were on the road, driving to spend Christmas with parents. At precisely the moment that Gordon Brown rang his mobile, Ed and Yvette realised they had forgotten the turkey they were providing for the family Christmas. 'He's gone,' announced Brown. 'We've got to turn back,' Balls said to his wife. 'No, you don't understand. There's no turning back,' said Brown. 'He's resigning at 11 o'clock.' The announcement actually came slightly later, just before the lunchtime news bulletins. Soon after, Robinson was gone as well. Mandelson's resignation missive began: 'I can scarcely believe I am writing this letter...', which was scarcely surprising to those who knew that it had been composed by Alastair Campbell. The swiftness of his departure, and the manner in which it had been dressed up in the resignation letter ghosted by Campbell, succeeded in creating the impression that he had honourably withdrawn to spare the Government prolonged torture at the hands of its opponents. Denis MacShane, the Labour MP for Rotherham, voiced a widely believed platitude: 'Nothing became Peter's holding of high office as the manner of his leaving.' The notion that this was a graceful, selfless sacrifice was deceptive. Peter Mandelson did not fall on his sword. Tony Blair gently, firmly, ruthlessly and necessarily thrust Mandelson on to the blade. Blair's fury was accompanied by a sense of loss. He saw the gaping tear left in the Cabinet. Mandelson had been a Blairite before Blair. He was one of the few who could be called believers in New Labour from more than convenience or sycophancy. There was also the worry for Blair of what a wretchedly depressed Mandelson might do. At around noon on the day of the resignation, the Prime Minister asked Mandelson to Chequers, a characteristically kindly, but also calculating, gesture. It is a sign of the froideur between them that Cherie initiated the call. 'You will always be part of the family,' she told Mandelson. Only when his wife had broken the ice did Blair himself come on the line to say: 'We want you to be with us.' Mandelson and his partner, Reinaldo Avila Da Silva, joined the Blairs' family supper and spent the night. Mandelson was now contrite. 'I know I've done a terrible thing,' he confessed to Blair. 'I've hurt you and I've hurt the Government.' Blair had written out some advice about how to work his passage back: sell the house, get around the constituencies, be a team player. 'For God's sake,' he said to Mandelson. 'Make some friends in the Labour Party.' An ocean of bad blood had been spilt. To the poisonous feud between Brown and Mandelson, and the destabilising rivalry of Blair and Brown, there had now been added a twist to the relationship between Blair and Mandelson. Blair could never again invest quite the same level of trust in Mandelson's judgment. Extract four: How Kosovo strained Blair's 'special relationship'",

Stephen soon forgot who his family was, but he remained perfectly fit. Eventually he lost his mobility, became blind, lost awareness of anyone around him, and could no longer swallow food. He died in his sleep three months ago, aged 51. anthony.browne@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Blue fruits have the most sensuous juice of all. Juice sweeter than the raspberry, more velvety than the strawberry and more intense even than the mango. But this juice is hidden from those who eat their fruit in the street. This is juice that only reveals itself to the cook. </p> <p>The damson and the Czar plum, the blueberry, the blackberry and the currant hide all their vivid nectar under a frail and dusky bloom. Unlike the blatant come-on of the strawberry and the sunset blush of the nectarine, they have a charm that remains lost to those who are not prepared to cook. The bloom is blue, the skin black and the flesh gold-green, but their juices are an inky purple, at once sweet and tart. </p> <p>None of these fruits are what you might call mass market. Raspberries, yes; peaches and strawberries certainly, but the blue fruits seem a more cultish crop. Whereas a peach will give up its juice to anyone with the ability to use their incisors or handle a Swiss army knife, only a cook can release the blue fruits' magic. A blackberry is sweet straight from the bramble; a raw blackcurrant deserves a place in a fruit salad, but their point only becomes truly obvious at the stove, when heat and sugar get their vibrant juices flowing. Scatter some sugar over these fruits and perhaps a tablespoon of water to stop them sticking to the pan, then leave them to bubble gently over a low heat. As the fruits pop their skins, the juices flow and mingle with the sugar, the fruits collapse. They are ready when they are bobbing around in a pool of the darkest purple. Nothing produces such heady syrup. </p> <p>The damson was at one point de-listed by some supermarkets. You couldn't find them for love nor money. I have banged the drum for this fruit for years, and at last someone seems to have listened. Perhaps I flatter myself, perhaps it is simply the merry-go-round of fashion that has brought this tiny, unassuming plum back into the spotlight. The same supermarkets who dumped it in favour of the kiwi now sell it with pride. I just say thank you and buy all I can use. This means not just pies and crumbles, but jam. This is the most welcome preserve I make - there is never enough - and that is not just because it is the very devil to find, but because even the artisan jammers manage to cook it to a slush. </p> <p>I wish the elderberry was as useful. It is, after all, the only fruit that will plant itself in our gardens without any help from us - I have a bush of them now. Their juice has a taste I have yet to acquire. No doubt I could try my hand at a frugal apple and elderberry pie, but there are better things to bake. Best leave it to the starlings and those who delight in turning anything free into that sinister concoction known as 'home-made wine'. </p> <p>There is much nostalgia for me in the blue fruits. Picking blackcurrants was a teenage summer job. I earned real money for the first time - an important landmark for a sheltered child - and came home with mauve lips and smelling of woodsmoke from the gypsies' fire. Having no packed lunches, I must have been awash with vitamin C from the currants I snaffled. (Did you know the pickers pee in the bushes?) Blackberries were something I picked from the hedges on the long walk to school. </p> <p>Damsons have, for me, always made the most luscious autumn puddings. Try them at the bottom of a sponge pud. One year we failed to harvest the fruit from our old tree; the leaves fell and left a tree bare but for its teardrop-shaped damsons. They were sweet that year, and as juicy as any Victoria plum. </p> <p>The blueberry is something of an odd man out here, being so associated with American baking, but I include it because of its stunning juice. It is milder than the blackcurrant it vaguely resembles. I predict a long, successful future for this exquisitely beautiful berry (dark and dusty like a bag of hidden jewels), and not just because of its long shelf-life. I have had a punnet in the fridge for 10 days with barely a wrinkle. The English-grown berries I have had this year have been better than ever, though I refuse to turn up my nose to those from elsewhere. I add them to a compote of blackcurrants (250g each black and blue, 3 tbsp sugar, a gentle boil and leave to chill - a breakfast to get you going), but you can make them into a pie with a soft, sugared crust or chuck them into a classic muffin mixture for a purple-veined fairy cake. Or you can eat them by the handful, a sort of good-for-you version of M&amp;M's, but that, to my mind, would be somehow missing the point. </p> <p> <strong> Damson almond tart</strong> </p> <p> Almonds flatter stone fruits. I use them ground in a pastry crust, and flaked as part of a crisp topping. Not the most instant of recipes, this, but worth every second of your time. Serves 8-10. </p> <p><strong> for the almond pastry</strong><br> 200g plain flour <br> 125g butter <br> 50g golden caster sugar <br> 50g ground almonds <br> 1 egg yolk </p> <p><strong> for the filling</strong><br> 450g damsons <br> 375g mixed blueberries and blackcurrants or blackberries <br> 5 tbsp blackcurrant or damson jam </p> <p><strong> for the almond crust</strong> <br> 80g shelled almonds <br> 3 tbsp demerara sugar <br> 100g coarse, fresh, white breadcrumbs <br> 100g butter </p> <p>You will need a rectangular tart tin, 30x20cm, with a removable base </p> <p>I cannot pretend this is an easy pastry to handle; it is very short and crumbly, but that is its point. It will help if you keep your ingredients, bowls and hands cool. Tip the flour into a mixing bowl, cut the butter into chunks and rub it into the flour with your fingertips. After a minute or so, it will look not unlike breadcrumbs. Stop, add the sugar, almonds and egg yolk, then mix it all together and bring it together with your hands. You want a ball of dough. Knead gently for 30 seconds or so. Don't overdo it - you just need to end up with a fairly smooth ball of dough. </p> <p>Roll the dough into a short, fat sausage. Using a large knife, cut thin slices from the dough - they will crumble a bit - and lay the slices over the bottom of the tart tin. They should sit snugly rather than overlap. Press the pastry with your fingers or knuckles so it forms a flattish base without any holes, then push it up the sides of the tin and trim the top edge level with a knife or your thumb. Prick the tart case all over with a fork, then chill it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Don't miss this step, or else the pastry will shrink and collapse in the oven. </p> <p>Meanwhile, weigh and rinse the fruit, fishing out any leaves, stems or dodgy fruits, then put them in a bowl with the jam. Cut the shelled almonds in slithers with a small knife, make the breadcrumbs, melt the butter and get the oven hot to 200 C/gas mark 6. Bake the tart case until it feels dry to the touch (about 20 minutes). Remove and let cool slightly, turning the oven down to 190 C/gas mark 5. Put the jam and fruits into the case, pushing the fruit down into one thick layer, then cover with the crumbs, sugar and nuts. Spoon over the melted butter, soaking the crumbs. Return to the oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, until the fruit has burst, the jam is bubbling and the nuts and crumbs are golden brown. Serve warm rather than hot, reminding everyone that there are damson stones to be negotiated. </p> <p> <strong> Poached pears with hot blackcurrant sauce</strong> </p> <p> You need sugar to sweeten and enrich the juice of the blackcurrant, the blueberry and the blackberry. How much will depend on the fruit you are using, its variety and its ripeness. Serves 4. </p> <p>4 pears <br> 3 tbsp honey <br> 1 litre water <br> a vanilla pod <br> a wide strip of orange peel </p> <p><strong> for the sauce</strong> <br> 350g blueberries, blackcurrants, damsons or a mixture <br> 5-6 tbsp caster sugar <br> 200ml water </p> <p>Bring the sugar, water, vanilla pod and orange zest to the boil, then turn down to a light simmer. Peel the pears, cut them in half lengthwise, and scoop out their cores with a teaspoon. Slide the pears into the hot honey syrup and leave them to poach. Turn them once or twice - they are ready when you can slide a knife into them with total ease. </p> <p>Let them cool a little in the syrup while you make the sauce. Pick over the fruit, removing any stalks. Put the fruit into a stainless-steel pan, add the sugar and water and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and leave to simmer until the fruit has burst and the cooking liquor is deep purple. </p> <p>Pour the fruit through a plastic or stainless-steel sieve, gently pushing the fruit through the mesh. Avoid the temptation to mash the fruit against the sieve too hard, which will make the sauce cloudy. Taste the sauce - stir in a little more caster sugar if it needs it. Sharpness isn't necessarily a virtue here. </p> <p>Lift the pears from their syrup with a draining spoon and lay them in a serving bowl. Spoon over the blue-fruit syrup, and serve warm. </p>",

      "body": "<p>We love Jamie Oliver for lots of reasons; his technical ability as a cook is not one of them. Sure, we love his minimalist flat and his tousled hair. We adore his matiness and his 'so laid back I'm horizontal' style. The obsession with good ingredients is cool, too - the way he flits from market to boutique bakery to pukka fishmongers and back again, squeezing and sniffing and fondling the produce as he goes. And yes we do, of course, love the food (or at least, I do). But that's not because we think he might be Escoffier's love child. On the contrary.

We adore his matiness and his 'so laid back I'm horizontal' style. The obsession with good ingredients is cool, too - the way he flits from market to boutique bakery to pukka fishmongers and back again, squeezing and sniffing and fondling the produce as he goes. And yes we do, of course, love the food (or at least, I do). But that's not because we think he might be Escoffier's love child. On the contrary. The whole Jamie Oliver brand has been marketed on exactly the opposite, a throw-it-together approach which, as he himself puts it in the credits, strips down recipes to their bare ingredients.

      "body": "<p>Regular readers of this column will be familiar with my references to our Jewel garden. This has been an experiment that my wife Sarah and I have been trying to follow for the past couple of years. The idea is to plant up an area of 40m by 20m with plants whose flowers and foliage are either richly coloured within the broad parameters of emerald, amethyst, ruby, and sapphire, or have a distinctly metallic hue, reflecting gold, silver, copper or bronze. </p> <p>I know I have written about this quite a bit over the last couple of years, but I am learning more from this project than almost anything else in the garden over the past 10 years. The experiment needs constant alteration and amendment. It isn't perfect and will never be so but, other than the days when it is ravishingly beautiful, it adds meaning to the heart of a garden that would otherwise merely be pretty. </p> <p>It is also an eye-opener to see how clear parameters can expand the creative process. Most of us do this indoors - with a colour scheme, for example - without batting an eyelid, but rarely carry the process on outside with anything like the same rigour. I think scale is the key. Big things like sky, trees and lawns, swamp and dilute all but the most confident attempts at colour themes. </p> <p>I think it's best to keep the area small enough to stick strictly to the limitations that define the space. That sounds a bit fierce, but the secret of any themed area of the garden is both to keep to that theme and to push it to the very limits. Every extra square metre of ground makes that task harder, as everything you plant slightly alters everything that is planted. Mathematically expressed, it means that for every extra square foot of planted area you have to take into account the extra cubic visual effect. </p> <p>Having said that, we have a whopping great area that we are trying to interweave with the precision and subtelty of needlepoint. Of course this means failure on a regular basis. The urge to let the reds slide into pink is constant and it hurts to remove the flowers of exquisite opium poppies that have seeded themselves and are just too pale a shade of purple. </p> <p>One of the main factors is the importance of the metallic colours. Gold, silver and bronze/copper foliage and flowers supplement green as links between the other colours, as well as having a role in their own right. Over the next three weeks I am going to see how these metallic colours have worked for us so far, starting with gold. </p> <p>The first question is when is gold not gold, but yellow? This matters because yellow - real, unarguable yellow - looks completely wrong. So most of the wonderful, luminous lime greens and acid yellows of spring - think of Euphorbia polychroma or Echaracias subsp. wulfenii in April - are not appropriate. Generally, spring yellows tend to be paler than the ones at this time of year, so golden flowers are thin on the ground until midsummer. There are a number of golden crocuses, and the species tulip Tulipa sylvestris counts as golden for me, as does 'Golden Apeldoorn'. The wallflower Erysimum x kewense 'Harpur Crewe' is also a good gold. </p> <p>Later in the year it simply becomes a matter of trial and error. All the buttercup/ egg-yolk-yellow flowers are perfect, from marigolds (with the amazing Calendula 'Indian Prince' as deep as gold will go before it becomes orange), the Californian poppy Eschscholzia californica (which, within its own variations, is as near as any flower gets to true gold) Lysimachia punctata, heleniums, sunflowers, Achillea filipendulina 'Gold Plate', the imperial fritillary, to the Ligularia przewalskii, L dentata 'Desdemona' and 'The Rocket' - although we only get away by having the ligularias in the borders due to our heavy, very moisture-retentive soil. The North American daisy rudbeckia is another border plant that secretly pines for a nice, soggy bog. Their daisy flower-heads have golden petals around curiously cone-shaped black centres. As long as the soil is wet, they are improved by being in full sun. </p> <p>I see that Nori and Sandra Pope, in their book Colour by Design (\u00a325, Conran Octopus) suggest golden chard, another plant that likes rich soil, which I was previously unaware of as a separate variety. I grow rainbow chard, which includes wonderful golden stems among the pinks and oranges but apparently can be selected out as a predictable golden contribution. We shall grow it in the Jewel garden next year. We also grow the hot Crocosmias, such as 'Lucifer' and 'Firebird', but species crocosmia x crocosmiiflora has rich, golden flowers and is very good. </p> <p>We started out with the pale-yellow potentillas, self-seeded rocket, variegated comfrey, Thalictrums and variegated sages but, after a year or so, realised that the pale gentleness simply does not work. It is false gold. You might think plant names would be a pretty foolproof guide and that 'Aureum' would be as good as gold. Not so. Bowles' golden grass ( Milium effusum 'Aureum') was too yellow and had to be taken out. Golden hop, Humulus lupus 'Aureus' is dodgy in spring, but it comes good later in the year, so can be forgiven for a month of what my American friends call 'chartroose'. </p> <p>Golden foliage is more constant through the growing season and therefore vital. Our rich soil suits hostas and some of them, if grown in full sun, are a good golden colour. Suitable varieties lurk beneath crassly suggestive names: there's Hosta 'Fragrant Gold', H 'Midas Touch' and H 'Golden Medallion' (for those brasher, shirt-open-to-the-navel moments). For a more elevated golden colour we planted a couple of Robinias ( Robinia pseudoacacia Frisia). I shall be planting a Cornus kousa chinensis this autumn, because it has a wonderful golden colour developing in the leaves in late summer. We also have a couple of hollies including 'Golden Queen', which has a golden margin. Despite its name, it is male and therefore produces no berries, whereas the other one, JC van Tol, has green leaves but produces yellow berries. </p> <p>Grasses are a significant contributor of gold to this bit of the garden. The wonderful waving wands of the giant stipas are molten gold in the evening sun and if you look at any summer meadow it is actually hardly green at all - more fawn. (How come fawn is suddenly allowed, whereas a decent yellow is summarily ejected? It is all to do with light. Trust me.) Calamgrostis x acutiflora turns from an orangey brown to gold with the light behind it, and Carex elata 'Aurea' has enough gold only to need sun to enhance its golden tones. We grow the bamboo Phyllostachys aureosulcata varaureocaulis , whose golden stems gleam through the plants before it. And Miscanthus nepalensis produces gold plumes like delicate strands of thread. It is a good one. * </p> <p><strong> Observer reader offer</strong> </p> <p> Readers can order a Crocosmia Collection, for \u00a36.99 including p&amp;p., which consists of 10 'Lucifer' bulbs and 10 'Firebird' bulbs.

      "body": "<p>There was only one moment in talking to Stephen King when he seemed uneasy, spooked. In his prefab office on an industrial estate, surrounded by Wal-Marts and warehouses out near the airport in Bangor, Maine, he was happy to open up about his addictions, his fears and his frailties. From behind a grizzled beard, through his thick glasses, he could laugh a little at last year's near miss with death in a road accident, even about the chronic pain in his shattered and pinned leg, for which he continues to take 'pills by the jarful'. But when, about halfway through the afternoon, we started to talk about his father, he stuttered a little, lost some of the warm articulation of his voice, and the rolling laugh that overtook him every now and then was replaced by a nervous chuckle. </p> <p>He seemed annoyed at himself for these slight tremors, and also faintly amused that it still affected him at all to talk in this way. It was not as though he hadn't been called on to explain it all before. King's father did the classic disappearing act when his son was two: went out to get a beer and was never seen or heard from again. His mother, who once believed she had spotted her lost husband on some grainy newsreel footage from Puerto Rico, never quite got over the small-town shame - and shame, King believes, is the most easily transferable of human emotions.</p> <p>'When my brother and I went off to school I can remember her very clearly saying, \"Now, if anybody asks about your father, tell them he's in the navy. That's not a lie.\" It wasn't a lie as far as we knew. But we sure as hell didn't know what was the truth. But I got the point: I was not a bastard. So that's what I said all through school, word for word.'</p> <p>Once, on a TV documentary, King made what struck me as an extraordinary statement. Talking about The Shining, a book, as he admits, 'about a man who wants to eat up his child', he noted that to his mind the nightmarish novel had an optimistic side - 'If a father is raging like that at a child, at least that father is there. For me there was just this vacuum, this empty place...' Thinking about that, there seemed an odd unanswered question. Here was perhaps the greatest suspense writer in the world, prepared to look harder at the more inexplicable extremes of human behaviour than almost anyone; he had virtually unlimited resources - he makes around $40 million 'in a good year' - so why wasn't he ever more curious to solve the big mystery at the heart of his own life: the question of where his dad went when he slipped out that afternoon?</p> <p>When I put this question to him, King paused for a few moments, shifted a little in his chair to get his remade hip more comfortable. Then he said something that seemed to come as a surprise, even to him. 'Well, we did find him, actually,' he explained slowly. 'What happened was this. The CBS TV network does these celebrity bios. They did one about me a little while ago, and they talked to my brother, and my brother had, he remembered, my dad's social security number, and one of these documentary guys went out and found him,' he laughed a little at the ridiculous ease of it, the vacuum suddenly filled, just like that. 'My father, it turned out, apparently died in Pennsylvania in the mid-80s. We even got some pictures. He had started a new family: three boys and a girl. My half-brothers and my half-sister.'</p> <p>He half-smiled at the thought. They've never met? 'Not at all. No. Never,' he said quickly. 'They don't know of my existence, and I think that's the way it should be.'</p> <p>Why? 'Well,' he suggested, a little curiously, 'the woman my father married was a Brazilian - very beautiful from the pictures I saw - and it's reasonable to assume she was Catholic. In that case, bigamy is a very serious thing, and it would have serious consequences for those children, and I couldn't bring them that knowledge...' He leaned back in his chair. 'I haven't talked about all this before,' he explained. 'Because I don't want that story widely published in the United States, for obvious reasons...'</p> <p>Stephen King's life sometimes seems swamped, overflowing with stories, some of them told, many of them, like this one, bursting to get out. He likens his fiction to a conduit or a sewer, depending on his mood, and there is never a lull in its output; huge new novels flood forth and old ones continually seep out from bottom drawers or dusty attics. Someone once claimed that every literate home in America had a Stephen King book in it; he seems to be on a one-man mission to keep Hollywood in screenplays. But all of this gushing narrative energy, he claims, has little to do with will or choice, he has no control over it, he's swept away midstream.</p> <p>He says he knew very early on that he'd become a storyteller. 'It's like something my mother said,' he explained. 'When she was pregnant with me she'd go out to the road and take the tar up, and chew the tar, because there was something in that tar, that, she, I, needed. It was a craving in her. Writing's like that for me. We all like to think about how smart we are. But I think talent as a writer is hard-wired in. You can't change it any more than you can choose whether to be right-handed or left-handed.'</p> <p>If his father has never been a presence in his life, King is still perhaps in this way his father's son. Donald King was in the merchant marines during the war, but when at home he wrote stories. Growing up, and starting out with his own fiction, King was unaware of this, but later his mother told him how the house had always been full of manuscripts. 'He used to send these things to magazines like Argosy and True. Magazines that don't really have an equivalent now, with, like, pictures on the front of guys fighting off grizzly bears with knives. Writing's a gene, no question, like the colour of your eyes.'</p> <p>Perhaps the world's genome mappers, if they are in search of a storyteller's particular cartography, could do worse than look at King's new book On Writing, part memoir, part novelist's vade mecum, which seeks to explain Stephen King's craving.</p> <p>'I sort of hope,' he said, smiling, 'it'll be a renegade primer. I don't think teachers will get away with assigning it to 13-year-olds, but I hope those 13-year-olds will find it on their own.'</p> <p>In it, he wanted to address that central question, the one with which he is assailed by fans and journalists: why does he write the awful things that he writes? 'And, like I say', he said, 'there's no direct way to answer that question, but I think, too, there are a set of experiences that turn a potential writer into a working writer, so I called the first section of the book \"CV\" because I wanted to say: here are my references, this is how I got here.'</p> <p>And how King got here is a tale worth telling. It contains, along the way, the story of how, at the age of four, he watched his best friend run over by a train, his mortal remains collected in a wicker basket; the report of his brother's half-cocked attempts at blowing up their town with amateur science experiments; his own obsession with Edgar Allan Poe movies and the copies of home-printed short stories he flogged around his school; and the tales of bullies and the bullied in a claustrophobic childhood community populated by characters like his friend, Tommy Davis, who every day went through the obituary column of the local newspaper and methodically crossed out the names listed there from his telephone directory at home. </p> <p>It is a tale filled throughout with the familiar Stephen King mixture of bucolic innocence and visceral horror. This dichotomy found its first expression in King, when, aged 11, he kept all the cuttings he could find on teenage serial killer Charlie Starkweather, who murdered 11 people in the Midwest in 1958. The attraction was not so much vicarious violence as self-preservation, 'my keeping a scrapbook on his progress was never like, \"Yeah, go Charlie, kill some more.\" It was more like, \"Charlie: if I ever see anyone like you, I'll be able to get the hell away.\" And I do think the very first time I saw a picture of him, I knew I was looking at the future. His eyes were a double zero. He seemed an outrider of what America might become...'</p> <p>King says he was not trying to sort out subconscious lumber through writing the memoir; he is not a fan of psychoanalysis: 'I think if you have real mental problems what you need are good pills.' But he does believe that if you have things that are unresolved, the more you talk about them, write about them, the less likely they are to damage you. At least, he said, smiling, that is how he has come to understand his work in retrospect.</p> <p>In this sense, his greatest fear, you imagine, is that all the stories will one day dry up. He speaks periodically about this coming drought, suggests occasionally that he is thinking of giving up writing, 'I just hope I know when to stop, when it starts to get repetitive. I have these Dark Tower books [a fantasy saga of seven, each about 700 pages long, inspired by Browning's dream poem 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came', of which four are done] that I'd like to finish, but then other things come along and you get interested in them, too.'</p> <p>The things he is interested in currently, include a new novel (his 36th) called Dreamcatcher, that he wrote while recuperating from his accident; a book he's collaborating on with the sci-fi writer Peter Straub called Talisman II; and a musical he's developing with the singer/songwriter John Cougar Mellencamp, ('He got in touch with me and said he had an idea for a play, so he came over to the house, tuned my guitar for me - it never sounded better - and told me this story, a ghost story, which sounded great. If it's ghosts you want I guess I'm the \"go to\" guy...'). There's also the forthcoming movie versions of his novels The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Hearts in Atlantis and of his story Stud City (which will bring the number of major King film adaptations up to 30), plus a couple of TV mini-series.</p> <p>Oh, and then there's the small matter of the one-man publishing revolution he is organising from his office. The day we met was the day the first chapter of his book The Plant was launched on the internet. Marsha, one of his two assistants, was inputting the copy in the next room. The Plant will be self-published (a return to the dime pamphlets he copied in high school) and payment will be on an honour system: you download it and send King a dollar, if more than 75 per cent pay up he will write the next chapter; if not, he won't. Occasionally, while we were talking, he levered himself up out of his chair and walked stiffly next door to check on progress, and came back grinning. The Wall Street Journal and Newsweek called while I was there, preparing stories on the death of corporate bookselling. 'As I say on the website,' he said at one point, 'we have the chance to be big publishing's worst nightmare.' And he gave me the same boss-eyed Bela Lugosi stare he had hammed up for our photographer earlier, 'Hah!'</p> <p>While listening to Stephen King telling tales about himself, I found myself doodling the words 'irresistible force' on my notepad. He is genial, funny and gracious in person, but there is the sense, too, of a huge, unstoppable energy in him. Part of his memoir deals with his early writing years, when this internal momentum seemed even stronger. There is the poignant story of him living in a trailer park, working all hours in a gruesome hospital laundry, writing his books at home on a typewriter balanced on his knee. He had started selling short fiction to men's magazines while he was in college, got married to his writing-class sweetheart Tabitha six or seven months after graduating, and for two years sold half a dozen stories a year. And then, as he explained to me, he 'sort of got out of the zone. And for a year or so, I couldn't sell anything, and I was drinking a lot - wasn't drugging, couldn't afford it - and </p> <p>I was writing mostly shit, and during that one year, I just thought: I'm going to be a high-school teacher, and nothing's ever going to happen to me. Then Carrie came along and everything changed...'</p> <p>The one thing the success of Carrie did not change, however, was King's drinking. </p> <p>I wondered if he could remember the moment when he knew it was a real problem.</p> <p>'Well,' he said, matter-of-factly, as if reciting a character's case history, 'I started drinking when it was legal for me to, and there was never a time when the goal wasn't to get as hammered as I could possibly afford to. I never understood social drinking, that's always seemed to me like kissing your sister.'</p> <p>By the mid-70s, as his career took off, King was drinking a case of beer before dinner every night, and then he would really get started. In On Writing, he talks about the negligible effect this spectacular consumption had on his productivity, but he is less forthcoming about the effect it had on his family life. The demons that make Jack Torrance want to destroy his wife and child in The Shining are conjured by his alcoholism. How close to home was that fear?</p> <p>'It's hard to say,' King suggested. 'My wife has told me since that I was hungover every morning until about two in the afternoon, and from five until midnight I was drunk out of my mind. She said there was this period of about three hours each afternoon when she could talk to me like a human being.' He laughed at the idea of this brief window of sanity. 'I was never the guy who said, \"Let's have a gin and tonic before dinner.\" I'd have to have, like, 12 gin and tonics and then I'd have to say fuck dinner and have 12 more. So I guess that was difficult to live with from time to time...'</p> <p>He did not go to bars much - 'one drunken asshole was all I could handle and that was me' - and he was writing most of the days. He believes that his two sons, both now writers, and his daughter, an Episcopalian minister, accepted his drinking as a part of life. 'Not a particularly pernicious part, either. I didn't beat up on them. Basically, I don't think I was so different from a lot of dads who have three or four martinis when they get in from work, wine with dinner and so on...'</p> <p>By 1979, however, and though still drinking, King was looking elsewhere for his highs. 'The drugs were a different story,' he explained. 'With cocaine, one snort and it just owned me, body and soul. It was like something in my system wanted that. When you turn on lights, there's no halfway. Cocaine was my on-switch. I did it for about eight years. Not a terribly long time to be an addict, I guess. But it's longer than World War Two...' he laughed his vaudeville laugh. 'And that's how it felt a lot of the time. I didn't really hide my drinking, but I hid my drugs, because I knew right away it was a problem.'</p> <p>If his drinking fears came out in The Shining, his drug paranoias found metaphorical expression in The Tommyknockers, a sci-fi fable in which the thought processes of a town's population are colonised by aliens: what the Tommyknockers offered their victims was 'energy and superficial intelligence'; what they extracted was their soul. A couple of the other books from this period King cannot remember writing a word of. Still, looking back now, he can be philosophical about it all. 'I like to think my coke addiction was a blessing in disguise,' he explained. 'Because I think without coke I'd have gone on drinking until about the age of 55 and it would have been a couple of lines in the New York Times: \"Writer Stephen King dies of stroke.\"' As it was, 'Once you add the coke, you eventually tip over, because that stuff just eats you up from the inside out.'</p> <p>King's tipping point came in 1987, when Tabitha collected that week's empties and drug trash and dumped the lot in a heap on the living-room floor in front of her husband. Was that the point at which he started to get himself back together? </p> <p>'Not really,' he said, wincing a little at the idea of his former, loaded, self. 'At that time I was, like, this very successful author, and that kind of success does not really lead you humbly to say, \"Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm an asshole.\" It rather leads you to say, \"Who the fuck are you to tell me to settle down? Don't you understand? I'm the king of the fucking universe...\" The worst of it was 1987 to 88, when I was looking for a d\u00e9tente, a way I could live with booze and drugs without giving them up altogether.' He laughed at the notion. 'Needless to say I was not successful in this.' </p> <p>His great fear, of course, at the time, was that if he jettisoned the booze and drugs, he would also rid himself of his storytelling powers. And, for a while, that seemed to be the case. For nearly a year he resigned himself to the bleak thought that he'd saved his life at the cost of his imagination. 'But I still had my kids. My wife loved me and I loved her. And eventually the writing came back and I discovered that the writing itself was enough of a buzz. Crazy thing is that probably it always had been...'</p> <p>King has been sober ever since. As we sipped grim root beers together - 'just two white guys chilling, hey Tim?' - I suggested to him that it seemed like the other reason he managed to get his life back together was the fact that he lived where he lived.</p> <p>He looked around his office. There was a Boston Red Sox-emblazoned toy Cadillac on the table along with other memorabilia of his work, including a director's chair from The Green Mile. The room had a comfortable homespun feel. Through the window, a couple of blocks away, was the little league baseball diamond King restored and funded; further into Bangor the public library he sponsors, and, just off the Main Street, with its factory outlets and farming suppliers, the Gothic mansion where he lives, writes and practises his guitar playing for the literary garage band he performs with. He is, in every sense of the words, at home.</p> <p>'When I'm in Bangor, people treat me as a neighbour, not as a celebrity freak with two heads, and that's too good to give up,' he explained. 'I've always been in this culture up to my eyeballs... New York isn't America. LA isn't America. This is America. New York is just this gaseous hype, there's no story there, not really. I can't satirise my fellow Americans from here. I am them...'</p> <p>He also feels safer here. Given the fact that he writes America's nightmares, it's not surprising that he worries a little that they will some day turn up on his doorstep. It's why he wanted to see me at his office rather than at his home. And it's why he found himself writing Misery, in which a best-selling novelist is held captive and tortured by a reader (memorably played in the film version by Kathy Bates) until he writes the story she wants.</p> <p>Every now and then he has heard from a version of this 'number-one fan'. There was an occasion a few years ago when his wife, alone in the house, was confronted by a man in her kitchen who claimed he had a bomb (in fact - neat metaphor - it was a bunch of pencils and erasers and paperclips in a box). The police eventually trapped the man, who claimed Stephen King had stolen Misery from his head, in the attic... Sometimes, too, he'll get a letter from someone who is obviously 'out there in the ozone, but no one yet has threatened to kill me, knock on wood. Though there is a guy out in California who believes me and Ronald Reagan conspired to kill John Lennon.'</p> <p>Ironically, and he has been quick to see the irony, when America finally did catch up with King it was in the person of a man who might easily have walked out of a trailer park and into the pages of one of his novels. In June last year, King was taking his daily constitutional one afternoon along the side of the highway near his weekend house in northern Maine, when he was hit by a van and thrown 14ft into the air. The van was driven by a man named Bryan Smith, who had taken his eyes off the road to wrestle with his Rottweiler, Bullet, which was trying to get at some steak in his cool box. King suffered a shattered hip and pelvis, broken ribs, a punctured lung and a fractured thigh bone. </p> <p>While King was recovering from the accident, his wife bought the Dodge mini-van for $1,600 to prevent Smith selling bits of it for souvenirs. When he is more fully recovered, King plans to take a sledgehammer to the van to return the compliment, as it were. Would he, I wondered, as he continues to go through his endless operations, sometimes like to do the same to its driver, who had several previous motoring convictions?</p> <p>He laughed. 'Well, this is a guy who only has a little bit of brains to start with. I mean I sometimes have fantasies about confronting him. But Bryan Smith is like Gertrude Stein said about LA: \"There's no there, there.\"'</p> <p>Reading his account of the story in his memoir, it is hard not to half-believe that the accident was scripted in some way. I wondered if it had changed his ideas of fate.</p> <p>'That's a big question, Tiiiim,' he boomed in reply, and thought for a moment. 'I guess I lean more toward the idea that some force is running things than not. Call it fate, call it God. There are so many things: if I'd left the house five minutes later, or if Tabby had come along as she often did... you can go on with the variables. But what you're left with is this guy, who has the IQ of a tomato-soup can. An empty tomato-soup can. And he hits me at the one blind spot on a long road, no one else to hit for miles, when, say, Nasa can't get a missile to land on Mars with all the brains and technology in the world, then maybe you think there's something odd going on. Or maybe Nasa should just hire Bryan Smith...'</p> <p>The accident has changed King, he says, in different ways. For a start, he appreciates being able to get up in the mornings more than ever, and he's relishing being a grandfather; it has also, perhaps, made him dwell a little on his longevity as a writer.</p> <p>For all his prolific output and enormous sales (probably because of that output and those sales), and for all the variety of his storytelling, the range of his writing, the one thing King hasn't been able to command is critical respect. He once suggested that his books were the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries, and the literary establishment has been happy to take him at his word. His books are routinely ignored in books pages, or judged on their tombstone typefaces. To this extent, some of the motivation behind his memoir is undoubtedly to establish the fact that he knows far more about his craft than the average creative-writing professor would have you believe. </p> <p>I wondered if he still got angry that he was pigeonholed as a horror writer, by his publishers as much as his public.</p> <p>'Ohhh,' he said wearily. 'The short answer is no. But if I see the red gels and the underlighting come out when someone comes to photograph me, I do walk out these days. All that shit to make me look spooky. I ask them if when they are photographing a black writer they bring a watermelon and a barrel for him to sit on, you know... It's degrading to be treated as someone who is so one dimensional. But once they decide you're a whore, they want to put you in a skirt, don't they?'</p> <p>King used to say, 'I'll be a horror writer if that's what people want,' but recently he has seemed less satisfied with that lot. Though still containing their share of terrors, recent novels have explored a whole range of subject matter. Bag of Bones is a surreal self-conscious version of Rebecca, set in upcountry Maine; The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is an intense first-person fairy tale told in the authentic voice of a little girl lost in the woods; Hearts in Atlantis is a book about the Vietnam years to set alongside Michael Herr's Dispatches or Tim O'Brien's short stories. </p> <p>The urge to publish himself on the net could be seen as part of this same impulse, a way for King to wrest back control of his image. It is also, you guess, inspired by a stubborn backwoods dislike of corporate New York, as well as being exactly the kind of Faustian social experiment he relishes in books such as The Stand. King has backed his faith in the idea that three-quarters of mankind (or at least of Stephen King readers) are basically honest: that they will pay their dollar in return for his chapters. Big publishing, of course, hopes that faith is misguided. (At the time of writing, King's judgement about the state of the human soul is proving almost unerring: 152,000 people have downloaded chapter one of The Plant, and 76.23 per cent have paid up.)</p> <p>He has experimented with publishing on the internet before, with his novella Riding the Bullet. On that occasion, although he had 500,000 hits the download often broke down under the weight of the encryption insisted upon by his American publisher. </p> <p>'It was like a fucking dinosaur,' he remembers angrily. 'And that drove me crazy. But the publisher loved that part. They say, like a rallying cry, \"Don't get napstered.\" Don't let the fruits of your artistic endeavour get stolen. But you know as well as I do that publishers, music producers, studio heads, they could not give a shit for the creator... They care about their bank books and that's about all they care about.'</p> <p>King's great strength in all of this is that money doesn't mean that much to him, or at least he has more than he will ever need to buy his T-shirts and jeans, a present for his wife, a new amp for his guitar. But his writing matters to him as much as it ever did, and his publishers will, he seems to be saying, underestimate the strength of that commitment, the irresistible force in Stephen King, at their peril. He is also enjoying it hugely.</p> <p>As if to prove the point, before I left him he worked himself up for one final good natured top-volume rant that began, surreally, with a convincing impression of Kingsley Amis. He dropped his chin to his chest and spoke through jowls. 'There's all these guys, these Kingsley Amis kind of guys,' he began, 'who for years have been saying, you know: \"books are dead, society going down hill, blah, blah, cultural waste land, idiots, idiots, TV, pop music, degrad- ation\" and then something comes along like Harry Potter, fucking thing is 734 pages long and it sells five million copies in 12 hours. That's up there with Britney Spears and Eminem. So the only recourse these people have then is to say [Kingsley again...] \"Well, JK Rowling or Stephen King is not literature.\" WELL, I'M SORRY! It may not be literature in their terms, but it's sure as hell a few rungs up from \"The Real Slim Shady\". </p> <p>'The age of the book is not over. No way. But maybe the age of some books is over. People say to me sometimes, \"Steve, are you ever going to write a straight novel, a serious novel?\" - and by that they mean a novel about college professors who are having impotence problems or something. And I have to say those things just don't interest me. Why? I don't know. But it took me about 20 years to get over that question, and not be kind of ashamed about what I do, of the books I write.' </p> <p>Stephen King paused, took a breath, he got stiffly to his feet, and smiled. 'That's not to say that there won't always be a market for crap... Just look at Jeffrey Archer! He writes like old people fuck, doesn't he?' Then the world's favourite storyteller gave a roar of a laugh, threw his root beer in the trash can, and went next door to check on the progress of the revolution. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/authors/author/0,5917,-98,00.html\">Stephen King on Books Unlimited</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "There was only one moment in talking to Stephen King when he seemed uneasy, spooked. In his prefab office on an industrial estate, surrounded by Wal-Marts and warehouses out near the airport in Bangor, Maine, he was happy to open up about his addictions, his fears and his frailties. From behind a grizzled beard, through his thick glasses, he could laugh a little at last year's near miss with death in a road accident, even about the chronic pain in his shattered and pinned leg, for which he continues to take 'pills by the jarful'. But when, about halfway through the afternoon, we started to talk about his father, he stuttered a little, lost some of the warm articulation of his voice, and the rolling laugh that overtook him every now and then was replaced by a nervous chuckle. He seemed annoyed at himself for these slight tremors, and also faintly amused that it still affected him at all to talk in this way. It was not as though he hadn't been called on to explain it all before. King's father did the classic disappearing act when his son was two: went out to get a beer and was never seen or heard from again. His mother, who once believed she had spotted her lost husband on some grainy newsreel footage from Puerto Rico, never quite got over the small-town shame - and shame, King believes, is the most easily transferable of human emotions. 'When my brother and I went off to school I can remember her very clearly saying, \"Now, if anybody asks about your father, tell them he's in the navy. That's not a lie.\" It wasn't a lie as far as we knew. But we sure as hell didn't know what was the truth. But I got the point: I was not a bastard. So that's what I said all through school, word for word.' Once, on a TV documentary, King made what struck me as an extraordinary statement. Talking about The Shining, a book, as he admits, 'about a man who wants to eat up his child', he noted that to his mind the nightmarish novel had an optimistic side - 'If a father is raging like that at a child, at least that father is there. For me there was just this vacuum, this empty place...' Thinking about that, there seemed an odd unanswered question. Here was perhaps the greatest suspense writer in the world, prepared to look harder at the more inexplicable extremes of human behaviour than almost anyone; he had virtually unlimited resources - he makes around $40 million 'in a good year' - so why wasn't he ever more curious to solve the big mystery at the heart of his own life: the question of where his dad went when he slipped out that afternoon? When I put this question to him, King paused for a few moments, shifted a little in his chair to get his remade hip more comfortable. Then he said something that seemed to come as a surprise, even to him. 'Well, we did find him, actually,' he explained slowly. 'What happened was this. The CBS TV network does these celebrity bios. They did one about me a little while ago, and they talked to my brother, and my brother had, he remembered, my dad's social security number, and one of these documentary guys went out and found him,' he laughed a little at the ridiculous ease of it, the vacuum suddenly filled, just like that. 'My father, it turned out, apparently died in Pennsylvania in the mid-80s. We even got some pictures. He had started a new family: three boys and a girl. My half-brothers and my half-sister.' He half-smiled at the thought. They've never met? 'Not at all. No. Never,' he said quickly. 'They don't know of my existence, and I think that's the way it should be.' Why? 'Well,' he suggested, a little curiously, 'the woman my father married was a Brazilian - very beautiful from the pictures I saw - and it's reasonable to assume she was Catholic. In that case, bigamy is a very serious thing, and it would have serious consequences for those children, and I couldn't bring them that knowledge...' He leaned back in his chair. 'I haven't talked about all this before,' he explained. 'Because I don't want that story widely published in the United States, for obvious reasons...' Stephen King's life sometimes seems swamped, overflowing with stories, some of them told, many of them, like this one, bursting to get out. He likens his fiction to a conduit or a sewer, depending on his mood, and there is never a lull in its output; huge new novels flood forth and old ones continually seep out from bottom drawers or dusty attics. Someone once claimed that every literate home in America had a Stephen King book in it; he seems to be on a one-man mission to keep Hollywood in screenplays. But all of this gushing narrative energy, he claims, has little to do with will or choice, he has no control over it, he's swept away midstream. He says he knew very early on that he'd become a storyteller. 'It's like something my mother said,' he explained. 'When she was pregnant with me she'd go out to the road and take the tar up, and chew the tar, because there was something in that tar, that, she, I, needed. It was a craving in her. Writing's like that for me. We all like to think about how smart we are. But I think talent as a writer is hard-wired in. You can't change it any more than you can choose whether to be right-handed or left-handed.' If his father has never been a presence in his life, King is still perhaps in this way his father's son. Donald King was in the merchant marines during the war, but when at home he wrote stories. Growing up, and starting out with his own fiction, King was unaware of this, but later his mother told him how the house had always been full of manuscripts. 'He used to send these things to magazines like Argosy and True. Magazines that don't really have an equivalent now, with, like, pictures on the front of guys fighting off grizzly bears with knives. Writing's a gene, no question, like the colour of your eyes.' Perhaps the world's genome mappers, if they are in search of a storyteller's particular cartography, could do worse than look at King's new book On Writing, part memoir, part novelist's vade mecum, which seeks to explain Stephen King's craving. 'I sort of hope,' he said, smiling, 'it'll be a renegade primer. I don't think teachers will get away with assigning it to 13-year-olds, but I hope those 13-year-olds will find it on their own.' In it, he wanted to address that central question, the one with which he is assailed by fans and journalists: why does he write the awful things that he writes? 'And, like I say', he said, 'there's no direct way to answer that question, but I think, too, there are a set of experiences that turn a potential writer into a working writer, so I called the first section of the book \"CV\" because I wanted to say: here are my references, this is how I got here.' And how King got here is a tale worth telling. It contains, along the way, the story of how, at the age of four, he watched his best friend run over by a train, his mortal remains collected in a wicker basket; the report of his brother's half-cocked attempts at blowing up their town with amateur science experiments; his own obsession with Edgar Allan Poe movies and the copies of home-printed short stories he flogged around his school; and the tales of bullies and the bullied in a claustrophobic childhood community populated by characters like his friend, Tommy Davis, who every day went through the obituary column of the local newspaper and methodically crossed out the names listed there from his telephone directory at home. It is a tale filled throughout with the familiar Stephen King mixture of bucolic innocence and visceral horror. This dichotomy found its first expression in King, when, aged 11, he kept all the cuttings he could find on teenage serial killer Charlie Starkweather, who murdered 11 people in the Midwest in 1958. The attraction was not so much vicarious violence as self-preservation, 'my keeping a scrapbook on his progress was never like, \"Yeah, go Charlie, kill some more.\" It was more like, \"Charlie: if I ever see anyone like you, I'll be able to get the hell away.\" And I do think the very first time I saw a picture of him, I knew I was looking at the future. His eyes were a double zero. He seemed an outrider of what America might become...' King says he was not trying to sort out subconscious lumber through writing the memoir; he is not a fan of psychoanalysis: 'I think if you have real mental problems what you need are good pills.' But he does believe that if you have things that are unresolved, the more you talk about them, write about them, the less likely they are to damage you. At least, he said, smiling, that is how he has come to understand his work in retrospect. In this sense, his greatest fear, you imagine, is that all the stories will one day dry up. He speaks periodically about this coming drought, suggests occasionally that he is thinking of giving up writing, 'I just hope I know when to stop, when it starts to get repetitive. I have these Dark Tower books [a fantasy saga of seven, each about 700 pages long, inspired by Browning's dream poem 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came', of which four are done] that I'd like to finish, but then other things come along and you get interested in them, too.' The things he is interested in currently, include a new novel (his 36th) called Dreamcatcher, that he wrote while recuperating from his accident; a book he's collaborating on with the sci-fi writer Peter Straub called Talisman II; and a musical he's developing with the singer/songwriter John Cougar Mellencamp, ('He got in touch with me and said he had an idea for a play, so he came over to the house, tuned my guitar for me - it never sounded better - and told me this story, a ghost story, which sounded great. If it's ghosts you want I guess I'm the \"go to\" guy...'). There's also the forthcoming movie versions of his novels The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Hearts in Atlantis and of his story Stud City (which will bring the number of major King film adaptations up to 30), plus a couple of TV mini-series. Oh, and then there's the small matter of the one-man publishing revolution he is organising from his office. The day we met was the day the first chapter of his book The Plant was launched on the internet. Marsha, one of his two assistants, was inputting the copy in the next room. The Plant will be self-published (a return to the dime pamphlets he copied in high school) and payment will be on an honour system: you download it and send King a dollar, if more than 75 per cent pay up he will write the next chapter; if not, he won't. Occasionally, while we were talking, he levered himself up out of his chair and walked stiffly next door to check on progress, and came back grinning. The Wall Street Journal and Newsweek called while I was there, preparing stories on the death of corporate bookselling. 'As I say on the website,' he said at one point, 'we have the chance to be big publishing's worst nightmare.' And he gave me the same boss-eyed Bela Lugosi stare he had hammed up for our photographer earlier, 'Hah!' While listening to Stephen King telling tales about himself, I found myself doodling the words 'irresistible force' on my notepad. He is genial, funny and gracious in person, but there is the sense, too, of a huge, unstoppable energy in him. Part of his memoir deals with his early writing years, when this internal momentum seemed even stronger. There is the poignant story of him living in a trailer park, working all hours in a gruesome hospital laundry, writing his books at home on a typewriter balanced on his knee. He had started selling short fiction to men's magazines while he was in college, got married to his writing-class sweetheart Tabitha six or seven months after graduating, and for two years sold half a dozen stories a year. And then, as he explained to me, he 'sort of got out of the zone. And for a year or so, I couldn't sell anything, and I was drinking a lot - wasn't drugging, couldn't afford it - and I was writing mostly shit, and during that one year, I just thought: I'm going to be a high-school teacher, and nothing's ever going to happen to me. Then Carrie came along and everything changed...' The one thing the success of Carrie did not change, however, was King's drinking. I wondered if he could remember the moment when he knew it was a real problem. 'Well,' he said, matter-of-factly, as if reciting a character's case history, 'I started drinking when it was legal for me to, and there was never a time when the goal wasn't to get as hammered as I could possibly afford to. I never understood social drinking, that's always seemed to me like kissing your sister.' By the mid-70s, as his career took off, King was drinking a case of beer before dinner every night, and then he would really get started. In On Writing, he talks about the negligible effect this spectacular consumption had on his productivity, but he is less forthcoming about the effect it had on his family life. The demons that make Jack Torrance want to destroy his wife and child in The Shining are conjured by his alcoholism. How close to home was that fear? 'It's hard to say,' King suggested. 'My wife has told me since that I was hungover every morning until about two in the afternoon, and from five until midnight I was drunk out of my mind. She said there was this period of about three hours each afternoon when she could talk to me like a human being.' He laughed at the idea of this brief window of sanity. 'I was never the guy who said, \"Let's have a gin and tonic before dinner.\" I'd have to have, like, 12 gin and tonics and then I'd have to say fuck dinner and have 12 more. So I guess that was difficult to live with from time to time...' He did not go to bars much - 'one drunken asshole was all I could handle and that was me' - and he was writing most of the days. He believes that his two sons, both now writers, and his daughter, an Episcopalian minister, accepted his drinking as a part of life. 'Not a particularly pernicious part, either. I didn't beat up on them. Basically, I don't think I was so different from a lot of dads who have three or four martinis when they get in from work, wine with dinner and so on...' By 1979, however, and though still drinking, King was looking elsewhere for his highs. 'The drugs were a different story,' he explained. 'With cocaine, one snort and it just owned me, body and soul. It was like something in my system wanted that. When you turn on lights, there's no halfway. Cocaine was my on-switch. I did it for about eight years. Not a terribly long time to be an addict, I guess. But it's longer than World War Two...' he laughed his vaudeville laugh. 'And that's how it felt a lot of the time. I didn't really hide my drinking, but I hid my drugs, because I knew right away it was a problem.' If his drinking fears came out in The Shining, his drug paranoias found metaphorical expression in The Tommyknockers, a sci-fi fable in which the thought processes of a town's population are colonised by aliens: what the Tommyknockers offered their victims was 'energy and superficial intelligence'; what they extracted was their soul. A couple of the other books from this period King cannot remember writing a word of. Still, looking back now, he can be philosophical about it all. 'I like to think my coke addiction was a blessing in disguise,' he explained. 'Because I think without coke I'd have gone on drinking until about the age of 55 and it would have been a couple of lines in the New York Times: \"Writer Stephen King dies of stroke.\"' As it was, 'Once you add the coke, you eventually tip over, because that stuff just eats you up from the inside out.' King's tipping point came in 1987, when Tabitha collected that week's empties and drug trash and dumped the lot in a heap on the living-room floor in front of her husband. Was that the point at which he started to get himself back together? 'Not really,' he said, wincing a little at the idea of his former, loaded, self. 'At that time I was, like, this very successful author, and that kind of success does not really lead you humbly to say, \"Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm an asshole.\" It rather leads you to say, \"Who the fuck are you to tell me to settle down? Don't you understand? I'm the king of the fucking universe...\" The worst of it was 1987 to 88, when I was looking for a d\u00e9tente, a way I could live with booze and drugs without giving them up altogether.' He laughed at the notion. 'Needless to say I was not successful in this.' His great fear, of course, at the time, was that if he jettisoned the booze and drugs, he would also rid himself of his storytelling powers. And, for a while, that seemed to be the case. For nearly a year he resigned himself to the bleak thought that he'd saved his life at the cost of his imagination. 'But I still had my kids. My wife loved me and I loved her. And eventually the writing came back and I discovered that the writing itself was enough of a buzz. Crazy thing is that probably it always had been...' King has been sober ever since. As we sipped grim root beers together - 'just two white guys chilling, hey Tim?' - I suggested to him that it seemed like the other reason he managed to get his life back together was the fact that he lived where he lived. He looked around his office. There was a Boston Red Sox-emblazoned toy Cadillac on the table along with other memorabilia of his work, including a director's chair from The Green Mile. The room had a comfortable homespun feel. Through the window, a couple of blocks away, was the little league baseball diamond King restored and funded; further into Bangor the public library he sponsors, and, just off the Main Street, with its factory outlets and farming suppliers, the Gothic mansion where he lives, writes and practises his guitar playing for the literary garage band he performs with. He is, in every sense of the words, at home. 'When I'm in Bangor, people treat me as a neighbour, not as a celebrity freak with two heads, and that's too good to give up,' he explained. 'I've always been in this culture up to my eyeballs... New York isn't America. LA isn't America. This is America. New York is just this gaseous hype, there's no story there, not really. I can't satirise my fellow Americans from here. I am them...' He also feels safer here. Given the fact that he writes America's nightmares, it's not surprising that he worries a little that they will some day turn up on his doorstep. It's why he wanted to see me at his office rather than at his home. And it's why he found himself writing Misery, in which a best-selling novelist is held captive and tortured by a reader (memorably played in the film version by Kathy Bates) until he writes the story she wants. Every now and then he has heard from a version of this 'number-one fan'. There was an occasion a few years ago when his wife, alone in the house, was confronted by a man in her kitchen who claimed he had a bomb (in fact - neat metaphor - it was a bunch of pencils and erasers and paperclips in a box). The police eventually trapped the man, who claimed Stephen King had stolen Misery from his head, in the attic... Sometimes, too, he'll get a letter from someone who is obviously 'out there in the ozone, but no one yet has threatened to kill me, knock on wood. Though there is a guy out in California who believes me and Ronald Reagan conspired to kill John Lennon.' Ironically, and he has been quick to see the irony, when America finally did catch up with King it was in the person of a man who might easily have walked out of a trailer park and into the pages of one of his novels. In June last year, King was taking his daily constitutional one afternoon along the side of the highway near his weekend house in northern Maine, when he was hit by a van and thrown 14ft into the air. The van was driven by a man named Bryan Smith, who had taken his eyes off the road to wrestle with his Rottweiler, Bullet, which was trying to get at some steak in his cool box. King suffered a shattered hip and pelvis, broken ribs, a punctured lung and a fractured thigh bone. While King was recovering from the accident, his wife bought the Dodge mini-van for $1,600 to prevent Smith selling bits of it for souvenirs. When he is more fully recovered, King plans to take a sledgehammer to the van to return the compliment, as it were. Would he, I wondered, as he continues to go through his endless operations, sometimes like to do the same to its driver, who had several previous motoring convictions? He laughed. 'Well, this is a guy who only has a little bit of brains to start with. I mean I sometimes have fantasies about confronting him. But Bryan Smith is like Gertrude Stein said about LA: \"There's no there, there.\"' Reading his account of the story in his memoir, it is hard not to half-believe that the accident was scripted in some way. I wondered if it had changed his ideas of fate. 'That's a big question, Tiiiim,' he boomed in reply, and thought for a moment. 'I guess I lean more toward the idea that some force is running things than not. Call it fate, call it God. There are so many things: if I'd left the house five minutes later, or if Tabby had come along as she often did... you can go on with the variables. But what you're left with is this guy, who has the IQ of a tomato-soup can. An empty tomato-soup can. And he hits me at the one blind spot on a long road, no one else to hit for miles, when, say, Nasa can't get a missile to land on Mars with all the brains and technology in the world, then maybe you think there's something odd going on. Or maybe Nasa should just hire Bryan Smith...' The accident has changed King, he says, in different ways. For a start, he appreciates being able to get up in the mornings more than ever, and he's relishing being a grandfather; it has also, perhaps, made him dwell a little on his longevity as a writer. For all his prolific output and enormous sales (probably because of that output and those sales), and for all the variety of his storytelling, the range of his writing, the one thing King hasn't been able to command is critical respect. He once suggested that his books were the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries, and the literary establishment has been happy to take him at his word. His books are routinely ignored in books pages, or judged on their tombstone typefaces. To this extent, some of the motivation behind his memoir is undoubtedly to establish the fact that he knows far more about his craft than the average creative-writing professor would have you believe. I wondered if he still got angry that he was pigeonholed as a horror writer, by his publishers as much as his public. 'Ohhh,' he said wearily. 'The short answer is no. But if I see the red gels and the underlighting come out when someone comes to photograph me, I do walk out these days. All that shit to make me look spooky. I ask them if when they are photographing a black writer they bring a watermelon and a barrel for him to sit on, you know... It's degrading to be treated as someone who is so one dimensional. But once they decide you're a whore, they want to put you in a skirt, don't they?' King used to say, 'I'll be a horror writer if that's what people want,' but recently he has seemed less satisfied with that lot. Though still containing their share of terrors, recent novels have explored a whole range of subject matter. Bag of Bones is a surreal self-conscious version of Rebecca, set in upcountry Maine; The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is an intense first-person fairy tale told in the authentic voice of a little girl lost in the woods; Hearts in Atlantis is a book about the Vietnam years to set alongside Michael Herr's Dispatches or Tim O'Brien's short stories. The urge to publish himself on the net could be seen as part of this same impulse, a way for King to wrest back control of his image. It is also, you guess, inspired by a stubborn backwoods dislike of corporate New York, as well as being exactly the kind of Faustian social experiment he relishes in books such as The Stand. King has backed his faith in the idea that three-quarters of mankind (or at least of Stephen King readers) are basically honest: that they will pay their dollar in return for his chapters. Big publishing, of course, hopes that faith is misguided. (At the time of writing, King's judgement about the state of the human soul is proving almost unerring: 152,000 people have downloaded chapter one of The Plant, and 76.23 per cent have paid up.) He has experimented with publishing on the internet before, with his novella Riding the Bullet. On that occasion, although he had 500,000 hits the download often broke down under the weight of the encryption insisted upon by his American publisher. 'It was like a fucking dinosaur,' he remembers angrily. 'And that drove me crazy. But the publisher loved that part. They say, like a rallying cry, \"Don't get napstered.\" Don't let the fruits of your artistic endeavour get stolen. But you know as well as I do that publishers, music producers, studio heads, they could not give a shit for the creator... They care about their bank books and that's about all they care about.' King's great strength in all of this is that money doesn't mean that much to him, or at least he has more than he will ever need to buy his T-shirts and jeans, a present for his wife, a new amp for his guitar. But his writing matters to him as much as it ever did, and his publishers will, he seems to be saying, underestimate the strength of that commitment, the irresistible force in Stephen King, at their peril. He is also enjoying it hugely. As if to prove the point, before I left him he worked himself up for one final good natured top-volume rant that began, surreally, with a convincing impression of Kingsley Amis. He dropped his chin to his chest and spoke through jowls. 'There's all these guys, these Kingsley Amis kind of guys,' he began, 'who for years have been saying, you know: \"books are dead, society going down hill, blah, blah, cultural waste land, idiots, idiots, TV, pop music, degrad- ation\" and then something comes along like Harry Potter, fucking thing is 734 pages long and it sells five million copies in 12 hours. That's up there with Britney Spears and Eminem. So the only recourse these people have then is to say [Kingsley again...] \"Well, JK Rowling or Stephen King is not literature.\" WELL, I'M SORRY! It may not be literature in their terms, but it's sure as hell a few rungs up from \"The Real Slim Shady\". 'The age of the book is not over. No way. But maybe the age of some books is over. People say to me sometimes, \"Steve, are you ever going to write a straight novel, a serious novel?\" - and by that they mean a novel about college professors who are having impotence problems or something. And I have to say those things just don't interest me. Why? I don't know. But it took me about 20 years to get over that question, and not be kind of ashamed about what I do, of the books I write.' Stephen King paused, took a breath, he got stiffly to his feet, and smiled. 'That's not to say that there won't always be a market for crap... Just look at Jeffrey Archer! He writes like old people fuck, doesn't he?' Then the world's favourite storyteller gave a roar of a laugh, threw his root beer in the trash can, and went next door to check on the progress of the revolution. Stephen King on Books Unlimited",

CA's advice is: 'Avoid buying new models that depreciate quickly and never pay full list price for a car.' </p> <p>Some cars lose more than two-thirds of their list price within three years, according to CA in the June issue of Which? magazine. The Citro\u00ebn Xantia 2.0iSX, costing around \u00a317,000 new, would be worth around \u00a35,000 after three years. </p> <p>CA found that on average, superminis (such as the VW Polo, Toyota Yaris, Ford Fiesta and Fiat Punto) would retain slightly more of their initial value than other cars. </p> <p>CA, using the motor industry forecaster CAP, evaluated cars to find out which were likely to retain their value best over the next three years. In the large family group the BMW 3 Series (318i SE four-door) leads the way, retaining 56 per cent of its value, followed by the Audi A4 (1.8 SE four-door) and the Mercedes C Class (200 Classic four-door). </p> <p>In the small family group, the Audi A3 (1.6 SE five-door) would retain 55 per cent of its value after three years, followed by the VW Golf (1.6 SE five-door ) and the Mercedes A Class (160 Classic five-door). </p> <p>In the supermini group the VW Polo (1.4 E three-door) would sell for 55 per cent of its value after three years, and it was followed by the Toyota Yaris (1.0 GS three-door) and the VW Lupo (1.0 E three-door). </p> <p>In each of the categories, Citro\u00ebns were at or near the bottom of the league tables.

      "bodyText": "When buying a new car, consider how much you will lose in depreciation - the biggest single cost in running a new car, says the Consumers' Association (CA). This has always been a problem in the UK car market, mainly because a huge proportion of new car sales are to fleet buyers, such as companies and rental firms, which buy at discounts and can afford to sell a few years later at low prices. CA's advice is: 'Avoid buying new models that depreciate quickly and never pay full list price for a car.' Some cars lose more than two-thirds of their list price within three years, according to CA in the June issue of Which? magazine. The Citro\u00ebn Xantia 2.0iSX, costing around \u00a317,000 new, would be worth around \u00a35,000 after three years. CA found that on average, superminis (such as the VW Polo, Toyota Yaris, Ford Fiesta and Fiat Punto) would retain slightly more of their initial value than other cars. CA, using the motor industry forecaster CAP, evaluated cars to find out which were likely to retain their value best over the next three years. In the large family group the BMW 3 Series (318i SE four-door) leads the way, retaining 56 per cent of its value, followed by the Audi A4 (1.8 SE four-door) and the Mercedes C Class (200 Classic four-door). In the small family group, the Audi A3 (1.6 SE five-door) would retain 55 per cent of its value after three years, followed by the VW Golf (1.6 SE five-door ) and the Mercedes A Class (160 Classic five-door). In the supermini group the VW Polo (1.4 E three-door) would sell for 55 per cent of its value after three years, and it was followed by the Toyota Yaris (1.0 GS three-door) and the VW Lupo (1.0 E three-door). In each of the categories, Citro\u00ebns were at or near the bottom of the league tables. It is probably worth considering an internet-based service, which may import from Europe. These include the Consumers' Association's carbusters.com, Direct Lines's jamjar.com, one swoop.com and virgincars.com. Standards of service are variable, however, and buyers should check delivery times and whether warranties from the Continent extend to the standard three-year guarantees given by UK retailers. When shopping for a second-hand car, www.autotrader.co.uk, the internet site of The Observer's sister publication Auto Trader, allows you to compare prices of the models you are interested in. Fuel economy is becoming an increasingly important factor for car buyers. The Government regularly surveys cars for fuel economy and publishes its top 10 lists (see table) at www.detr.gov. uk. The AA's website theaa.com includes a list of motoring costs for a variety of different cars. Financing your car ACCORDING to internet finance operation E-Loan, (www.E-Loan.com/UK) motorists borrow an average of \u00a36,800 to fund the purchase of a car. A survey by rate-tracking service Moneyfacts at the beginning of this month showed that the more competitive rates for \u00a35,000 loans over three years ranged from 9.2 per cent (APR) at Northern Rock to 10.9 per cent at Alliance &amp; Leicester. For car loans, which may include special deals such as a free AA car buyer inspection, they ranged from 9.9 per cent at the Woolwich to 15.9 per cent at Lloyds TSB. Cutting running costs Fuel-saving measures won't necessarily cut your petrol bill dramatically, but it is worth knowing the factors behind petrol consumption. The AA calculates that a trip from London to Exeter costing \u00a315 to \u00a320 with normal driving is likely to cost an extra \u00a35 or more if you use your car in the least efficient way. Driving too fast, or too slow, has an impact. Speeding at 80-85 mph increases fuel costs by 25 pence or more for every 10 miles. Every minute idling in a traffic jam costs a small car driver nearly 1.5p and double for a larger car. Here are five more ways to cut petrol consumption. \u0095 Roof racks, even when empty, cut a car's fuel economy by at least 10 per cent and when loaded high can reduce it by 30 per cent. \u0095 Keeping windows and sun roofs open will add \u00a31 to a journey's cost. Try air vents before opening windows. \u0095 Air conditioning eats petrol at a rate of between 5 and 7 per cent more than normal. Don't use it all the time. \u0095 Put a sunscreen inside the windscreen. \u0095 Under-inflated tyres and the weight of passengers will also reduce efficiency by one mile per gallon. If carrying extra passengers or heavy luggage, adjust the tyre pressure to compensate.

Hers is a more spacious culture than was Rebecca West's; and the moral passion is often more telling than were the ironies of Mary McCarthy. A fundamental theme unifies much in her articles, reviews, essays and books. It is that of the embodiment of evil, of pathological hatred and unreason. </p> <p>To this black hole, Sereny - the name is finely inappropriate - brings an expertise in psychology and an alertness to social history. Everything suggests, moreover, that Sereny has a special and patient charisma. Doors habitually barred open for her; herself from a privileged background, she is at ease with high society, with the salons of power ('corridors' seems too drab a word).</p> <p>And when Sereny has cornered her quarry, be he politician, academic or sadistic butcher, she closes in with uncompromising acuity, but with a seriousness, an intimation of personal vulnerability which establish a revealing trust. This has been most manifest in her complex relationship - dare one speak of a liaison of sensibility? - with Albert Speer. </p> <p>Speer is present throughout this collection extending from 1967 to 1995 (one unpublished piece is dated 2000). Frequently, Sereny is in inner dialogue with Speer or summons him as witness. She is tormented, as she was in her biography of Hitler's master-builder, by the central crux: what did a man like Speer, so brilliantly gifted, so perceptive, know of the realities of the Holocaust? Did he lie when he professed ignorance or only very indirect, vague awareness? How seriously is one to take his postwar repentance, his expressions of self-condemnation? Was Sereny taken in? In this book of investigations and confrontations, this same question is brought to bear on individual survivors and, by unforced extension, on the German people as a whole. </p> <p>Two axioms underwrite Sereny's tireless sleuthing. She rejects the thesis that the Shoah was unique, a singularity without parallel in human bestiality. Whatever its horror and inconceivably systematic methods, the Auschwitz phenomenon belongs to a context of totalitarian massacres characteristic of the twentieth century. Although there is about such statistical comparisons a touch of obscenity, the fact remains that Stalin and Mao did to hideous death far more men and women than did Hitler. </p> <p>I cannot come to any clear view of this desperate question. There are moments when the Nazi attempt to exterminate all Jews because they existed, because their crime was 'to be', seems to me unlike any other act of crazed savagery. At other moments, I am not certain as to the difference with, say, the massacre of natives in the Belgian Congo (10 million) or that of Armenians or of Kulaks. But though Sereny's posit lacks philosophic reach, it is a respectable hypothesis. </p> <p>Second, this book asks us to grasp, to honour, the extent of German attempts to come to honest terms with the hideous past. West German democracy has laboured to instruct the young as to the facts; it put many of the murderers and torturers on trial, it has built museums and memorials to the victims. I would cite many painful exceptions and look with more apprehension than does Sereny to the venomous spurts of neo-Nazism and racism in Germany today. Nevertheless, Sereny's point is well taken. Her case would have been even more forceful had she drawn a comparison with the continued stench of anti-Semitism, lies or unctuous indifference in Austria since 1945. </p> <p>The most moving witness is that which deals with the slaughter and deportation of children, notably in and from Poland. Sereny was personally involved with UN efforts to find, identify and repatriate children abducted by the Nazis. Should these wretched victims be sent back to a culture, to communities that had become alien to them? There is worse: 'Historically, no Jewish child is known to have survived the four specific extermination camps of Chelmno, Belsec, Sobibor and Treblinka.' This is one of a number of sentences in this book which it is almost unbearable to read, let alone take in. </p> <p>Discussing studies of Hitler and the revisionist filth of those who seek to deny the Shoah, Sereny wonders at the abiding fascination of the man. Is she unconscious of being herself a prime instance? To gauge Hitler's dimensions, one need only bring to mind that history and our present condition would be unimaginably different had one of the bullets which struck Hitler in the trenches in 1914-18 been closer to a vital organ. There were gifted thugs around Stalin; Hitler looks to have been monstrously irreplaceable. </p> <p>Sereny reviews the evidence we have for the fact that an individual's refusal to carry out Waffen-SS orders, to perform bestial acts on civilians, did not entail any grave danger or retribution. Here again, there is a striking difference from the Stalinist regime in which any such refusal brought immediate elimination. The deep-lying contradiction in Sereny's defence of German normality is, however, patent. She refuses Goldhagen's verdict on some inherent criminality in the character and history of Germany. How, then, are we to explain the virtual totality of acquiescence in Nazi policies and actions even where saying 'No' was not a fatal risk? </p> <p>Many other vexed issues are raised in these articles. Clearly, much that speaks of ugliness, corruption and primitive anti-Communism attaches to American protection of notorious Nazis and war criminals at the close of the war. Documents were forged, identities altered, immunities extended by 'at least four US agencies - the OSI, the FBI, Fort Meade and the CIA'. Together with the Vatican, US operatives made possible the escape from justice of some of the worst mass-killers. Reading Sereny's fierce exposures, one can only wonder at her ruling that Speer had to be allowed to 'recapture his lost morality. Unless we deny all men the potential for regeneration, this man, I believe, must now be allowed peace.' </p> <p>In regard to those who have preceded her in these dark waters, Sereny is strikingly ungenerous. Unless I mistake, the name of Eli Wiesel does not appear. </p> <p>A key point on the unacceptability of allowing Hitler to use 'our common language', to let him speak to us directly, echoes almost verbatim a novel and a play widely known prior to Sereny's text. No acknowledgement is granted. For someone of Sereny's quality, such egotism is hardly necessary.</p>",

Together with the Vatican, US operatives made possible the escape from justice of some of the worst mass-killers. Reading Sereny's fierce exposures, one can only wonder at her ruling that Speer had to be allowed to 'recapture his lost morality. Unless we deny all men the potential for regeneration, this man, I believe, must now be allowed peace.' In regard to those who have preceded her in these dark waters, Sereny is strikingly ungenerous. Unless I mistake, the name of Eli Wiesel does not appear. A key point on the unacceptability of allowing Hitler to use 'our common language', to let him speak to us directly, echoes almost verbatim a novel and a play widely known prior to Sereny's text. No acknowledgement is granted. For someone of Sereny's quality, such egotism is hardly necessary.",

He wrote it in shorthand and partly in code, and so far as we know never shared its contents with anybody, not even his most intimate friends, and certainly not his wife. </p> <p>Had it not been for his diary, Pepys would be remembered, if he were remembered today at all, as a reforming administrator, a confidential adviser to King Charles II and his brother, the Duke of York, (later James II), and to the statesmen that served them. Pepys was, if it is not an oxymoron to say so, a great civil servant, the principal architect of the Royal Navy that was to play such a crucial role in the nation's destiny during the centuries that followed. </p> <p>According to the scholar J.R. Tanner, Pepys was 'one of the best officials England ever had'. He became a grandee, a Member of Parliament, master of Trinity House, a governor of Christ's Hospital, deputy lieutenant for Huntingdonshire and president of the Royal Society. He was the prime mover in the building of the Royal Naval Hospital in Greenwich. But such achievements, solid and worthwhile though they are, do not normally inspire biographies more than three centuries after the subject's death. It is the diary that makes Pepys a figure of universal and lasting interest. </p> <p>Pepys's origins were humble. His father was a London tailor, his mother a laundress. He attended St Paul's School, then, as now, among the best in the land (Milton had been a schoolboy there 20 years earlier) and won an exhibition to Cambridge, where he took a degree at Magdalene. Afterwards, he joined the staff of his influential cousin Edward Montagu, one of the most powerful figures in Cromwell's Protectorate, who, by the time of Cromwell's death, had assumed active control of the Navy. It was at this point, when Pepys was 26 years old, a young clerk on the make, that he began to keep a diary. Less than a decade later, he stopped, mistakenly fearing that the strain on his eyesight might result in blindness. </p> <p>Pepys's diary, therefore, covered fewer than 10 years of his 70-year-long life, but this was to be one of the most eventful decades in English history. Already, as a horrified schoolboy, Pepys had been present at the execution of Charles I. Now, he sailed with the fleet that brought back Charles's son from exile and witnessed the moment when the young Charles II landed at Dover. As the royal barge headed for the shore, one of the spaniels 'shit in the boat, which made us laugh and me to think that a king and all who belong to him are but just as others are'. </p> <p>He was present, too, at the coronation, having secured a good vantage-point some seven hours before the king arrived. These dramatic scenes were recorded in the diary in calm, clear, masculine prose. A few years later, Pepys stayed in London during the plague, while most of those who had somewhere to go fled to the countryside, and the following year he was able to report at first hand the Great Fire of London. </p> <p>These terrible events are magnificently described, and they are interspersed with telling social and psychological detail: for example, his joking response to the king, who asked the passing Pepys where his boat was headed, and received the facetious reply, 'to wait on our masters in Westminster'. After this quip, Pepys wondered if he had gone too far. </p> <p>The diary has achieved a notoriety for what it reveals of Pepys's sex life: seducing vulnerable women and groping young chambermaids. It is perhaps too easy to condemn Pepys, as this biographer does, for being a lecher and a hypocrite. </p> <p>Pepys was at least honest with himself about what he did. He had married for love a girl of only 15 with no fortune or connections; unluckily, she suffered from a recurrent abscess on her labia, which made intercourse difficult. Pepys soon discovered that he was infertile, perhaps another reason for his promiscuity. </p> <p>His patron, Montagu, rose to become Earl of Sandwich, and Pepys followed in his wake. He quickly showed the qualities of an efficient bureaucrat. 'My delight is in the neatness of everything, and so cannot be pleased with anything unless it be very neat.' He was supremely methodical and possessed an ability to master an immense amount of detail quickly; he was an excellent speaker and a fluent writer. He became a wealthy man, a leading figure in naval affairs and, as such, he had to answer to a committee of the House of Commons for the unpreparedness of the Navy during the Second Dutch War, when the Dutch fleet sailed up the Medway and set Chatham on fire, one of the most humiliating episodes in British naval history. </p> <p>After the attack, the popular outrage was such that Pepys feared for his life and property. He took to wearing a belt round his waist containing \u00a3300 in gold, and sent the rest of his valuables away to the country, among them the volumes of his diary, 'which I value much'. </p> <p>Why did Pepys keep a diary? There are tantalising hints in this biography. Pepys was making a balance sheet of his world: 'The historian was writing a history of himself... his diary became his means of coming to an understanding of a new way of life.' To modern readers, it may seem odd that such a man should have felt such a compulsion to write so ambitiously and so revealingly. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Stephen Coote is no writer himself and thus his capacity to help us understand Pepys is limited. His prose is littered with grammatical errors, non sequiturs, false antitheses and words misused. To choose just one example, he seems to think that schadenfreude means a guilty delight in erotica, rather than a malicious pleasure in the misfortune of others. </p> <p>Just as his style is clumsy, so is his history shaky. The figures in Pepys's life are not so much portrayed as caricatured. This poorly edited biography adds nothing new to the much better one by Richard Ollard issued by the same publishers in 1974. </p> <p>Far from offering us a new perspective on Pepys, Coote's book makes him less, rather than more understandable.

It is no surprise, then, to find that Juan Goytisolo's new novel touches only tangentially on political reality; none the less, his recurring concerns gleam through the fantastical narrative. </p> <p>Goytisolo's novels were banned in his native Spain until the death of Franco and since 1956 he has lived in exile in Paris and Marrakesh. Defiantly pluralist, he has long been an advocate of multiculturalism and a fierce opponent of Spain's obstinate refusal to acknowledge the extent of Moorish and Jewish contributions to its culture and history, particularly its literature. </p> <p> The Garden of Secrets is an attempt to recreate the polyphonic nature of literature by presenting the novel as a series of tales told by a circle of 28 anonymous readers over a period of three weeks. His 28 storytellers - one for each letter of the Arabic alphabet, a nod to the Cabbala - bring together, we are told, an impressive range of educational backgrounds, professions, literary tastes and ideologies with a specific, anti-authoritarian aim. </p> <p>'The collaborative project was based on the systematic demolition of that disposable entity, the novelist, a happy, liberating dispensation' and 'the co-readers' aim was to put an end to the oppressive, pervasive notion of the Author'. Goytisolo's thoroughly postmodern conceit is so successful that it is almost possible to forget that these multiple storytellers, so richly different in their narrative voices, are really all the creatures of his imagination. </p> <p>Almost, but not quite. The first chapter, in which the Circle's nameless scribe sets out the project, explicitly acknowledges a debt to two of the Spanish-language writers Goytisolo cites most frequently as his influences: 'Our Cervantine garden, with its flowerbeds and borders, belonged also to Borges: forking paths, advancing, extrapolating, halting, turning back.' But there are other, unstated tributes - to Calvino, to Boccaccio, to A Thousand and One Nights and particularly to the tradition of oral storytelling. There is also a Borgesian game going on in the deconstruction of the identity of Juan Goytisolo, whose name appears on the book jacket. In a sly joke, he dispatches this problem in the final chapter: </p> <p>'Before breaking up, the Readers' Circle invented an author... they forged a rather fancy Iberian-Basque surname, Goitisolo, Goitizolo, Goytisolo - the last one finally won the day... wrote an apocryphal biography and imputed to him the creation - or desecration? - of 30-odd books...' What is identity if not a fictional construct? </p> <p>The springboard for all the stories is the protean identity and unknown fate of a poet, known only as Eusebio, a Republican, homosexual and friend of Lorca's, who escaped execution by the Falangistas in 1936 to be interned in the military psychiatric centre in Melilla. Some rumours suggest that he escaped with the help of a former lover and lived as an exile in North Africa, other versions that he was successfully 'cured' of his political and sexual heterodoxies and returned to Spain a faithful supporter of the regime. </p> <p>Thus the storytellers have only a name and a fragment of biography, and the stories they craft remind the reader that history can be rewritten, falsified, reinterpreted. There is no definitive account, no common ending. Goytisolo's narrators are inventing myths while subverting genres. The most explicitly political are brutal reminders of what the Republicans suffered under Franco; others weave in magic realism, inventing false identities for Eusebio, and yet others touch on him only indirectly, building on preceding stories and introducing a cast of characters who populate the arid Moroccan landscape of his later years. </p> <p>Those who long for the clear lines of realist fiction will perhaps find the novel frustrating. But Goytisolo's extraordinary lyrical and imaginative gifts, faithfully transposed here by his long-time translator, Peter Bush, are simultaneously forceful and beguiling, and the only response is to give in to the tumultuous, hallucinatory voices. If Juan Goytisolo is a fiction, imagine the author who created him.</p>",

The heroine of the story-within-a-story finds this tale harsh, although it is an exaggerated account of her own plight, and her lover's: ours also is a planet where the poor are sacrificed to the rich, and where the system continues to find uses for those it has destroyed. </p> <p>When she asks for a happy story, she gets a story about the impossibility of happiness instead. He tells her about two battle-weary fighters who find themselves on a planet where all their needs are taken care of, by the doting Peach Women of Aa'A, women who grow on trees, on a stem running into the top of their heads, 'picked when ripe by their predecessors'. The moral of the story is that a paradise that you can't get out of can only be hell. </p> <p>The other parts of Laura's book are less persuasive; it's easier to imagine such a book making a local scandal at the time of publication, with its relative frankness and society-girl author, than being quoted 50 years later. </p> <p>John Updike has commented on the drawback of multiple time-schemes, multiple narratives in general, the way they lessen the momentum of the whole. A further drawback in the case of The Blind Assassin is that the story's eventful period, all the muted melodrama of abortions and asylums, runs from the mid-Thirties to Laura's suicide 10 years later, while the novel's expansive scheme requires the author to do a lot of filling in. Iris's memoirs, written in the 1990s, contain much philosophical reflection that seems to mark time: 'You want the truth, of course. You want me to put two and two together.

The UNDCP is seeking safe crop-eradication techniques. This project could lead to a major breakthrough in this field.

      "byline": "Andrew Rawnsley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At his third emergency press conference in Downing Street in as many days, a fret-lined Tony Blair was asked what lessons he had learned from the most critical week of his premiership. The Prime Minister looked dazed and sounded confused. Like a man who has come within a centimetre of losing his life in a car wreck, it will take time for it all to sink in. His mind will be replaying and freeze-framing these past seven days for the rest of his career. Weeks, months, even years later, I suspect sweat-drenched nightmares will wake him with a start in the dark reaches of the night.</p> <p>One big and terribly frightening lesson is that modern society is a fuel tank away from anarchy. A motley bunch of tax vigilantes composed of farmers and truckers can press their thumbs on the national windpipe and have the entire country gasping for breath. If that is a disturbing thought for everybody, it is an absolutely petrifying one for any government, and especially for a leader who has invested so much emphasis on being in control. The bleakest moment inside Number 10, so I hear from within the bunker, was on Wednesday morning. Tony Blair's premiership was 48 hours away from meltdown. His jut-jawed pledge of the previous afternoon that the tankers would roll was not being fulfilled. One of the non-leaders of the protesters gloated: 'The Government is hanging by a thread.'</p> <p>That is what the Government thought, too. Some people were going to start dying; many people would soon have been without food. Gales of relief gusted down Whitehall when the protesters voluntarily packed up, even though it allowed them to claim a 'moral' victory over the Prime Minister.</p> <p>The obvious, practical lessons - that there should be fuel reserves for essential services and the police should never again respond with such mysterious lethargy - will be implemented by the Home Secretary's Task Force. Procedures for handling this sort of emergency will be brushed up.</p> <p>The Prime Minister, preoccupied with Sierra Leone last weekend, was not alone in being slow to see the dangers posed by the mutiny of Sierra Man. It was only on Monday evening, when he faced the grim prospect of an all-night confinement in a Chinese restaurant in Hull with John Prescott, that Tony Blair began to grasp the scale of the threat. One reason that the Government was caught with its collective pants around its ankles is because there are now very few people in Whitehall, either among the politicians or the civil servants, who have experience of dealing with national crises. The Three Day Week and the Winter of Discontent are sepia memories of the Seventies, which New Labour thought, as did we all, were time-locked in a basement archive.</p> <p>Blair's basic instinct not to give way to blackmail was right in principle. A democracy cannot be held to ransom by a couple of thousand self-described nobodies whipped up by right-wing newspapers. Pay the Danegeld once and you will never be rid of the Dane. Had he given way, then fox-hunters and every other loud and self-interested minority with a grudge against the Government would soon be picketing fuel supplies. Nor, as the plunge in the standing of Lionel Jospin in France demonstrates, do populist quick fixes win long-term respect.</p> <p>At the moment of crisis, Blair chose to do the firm thing rather than the populist thing, saying he would not be bullied by barricades. Yet, by the end of the week, he had switched back into I-feel-your-pain mode, telling the very people he had earlier accused of intimidation that he empathised with their 'genuine and sincere grievances'. New Labour has been presented with the hazards of the populism which it has so often pandered to. Tony Blair has prided himself on his ability to read public emotion and shape his government to the contours of national sentiment. This is an unreliable compass for governing, and it becomes a hopeless one when the public mood turns schizophrenic. How to explain the fact that the public were overwhelmingly on the side of the very blockaders who were making the nation's life a misery? It simply confounded the mood maestros of New Labour.</p> <p>One conclusion that Mr Blair can immediately draw is that the Government will never be everyone's friend. There is a slice of Britain, small and unrepresentative, but noisy and potentially dangerous, that will not be reconciled to a Labour government in any circumstances.

      "bodyText": "At his third emergency press conference in Downing Street in as many days, a fret-lined Tony Blair was asked what lessons he had learned from the most critical week of his premiership. The Prime Minister looked dazed and sounded confused. Like a man who has come within a centimetre of losing his life in a car wreck, it will take time for it all to sink in. His mind will be replaying and freeze-framing these past seven days for the rest of his career. Weeks, months, even years later, I suspect sweat-drenched nightmares will wake him with a start in the dark reaches of the night. One big and terribly frightening lesson is that modern society is a fuel tank away from anarchy. A motley bunch of tax vigilantes composed of farmers and truckers can press their thumbs on the national windpipe and have the entire country gasping for breath. If that is a disturbing thought for everybody, it is an absolutely petrifying one for any government, and especially for a leader who has invested so much emphasis on being in control. The bleakest moment inside Number 10, so I hear from within the bunker, was on Wednesday morning. Tony Blair's premiership was 48 hours away from meltdown. His jut-jawed pledge of the previous afternoon that the tankers would roll was not being fulfilled. One of the non-leaders of the protesters gloated: 'The Government is hanging by a thread.' That is what the Government thought, too. Some people were going to start dying; many people would soon have been without food. Gales of relief gusted down Whitehall when the protesters voluntarily packed up, even though it allowed them to claim a 'moral' victory over the Prime Minister. The obvious, practical lessons - that there should be fuel reserves for essential services and the police should never again respond with such mysterious lethargy - will be implemented by the Home Secretary's Task Force. Procedures for handling this sort of emergency will be brushed up. The Prime Minister, preoccupied with Sierra Leone last weekend, was not alone in being slow to see the dangers posed by the mutiny of Sierra Man. It was only on Monday evening, when he faced the grim prospect of an all-night confinement in a Chinese restaurant in Hull with John Prescott, that Tony Blair began to grasp the scale of the threat. One reason that the Government was caught with its collective pants around its ankles is because there are now very few people in Whitehall, either among the politicians or the civil servants, who have experience of dealing with national crises. The Three Day Week and the Winter of Discontent are sepia memories of the Seventies, which New Labour thought, as did we all, were time-locked in a basement archive. Blair's basic instinct not to give way to blackmail was right in principle. A democracy cannot be held to ransom by a couple of thousand self-described nobodies whipped up by right-wing newspapers. Pay the Danegeld once and you will never be rid of the Dane. Had he given way, then fox-hunters and every other loud and self-interested minority with a grudge against the Government would soon be picketing fuel supplies. Nor, as the plunge in the standing of Lionel Jospin in France demonstrates, do populist quick fixes win long-term respect. At the moment of crisis, Blair chose to do the firm thing rather than the populist thing, saying he would not be bullied by barricades. Yet, by the end of the week, he had switched back into I-feel-your-pain mode, telling the very people he had earlier accused of intimidation that he empathised with their 'genuine and sincere grievances'. New Labour has been presented with the hazards of the populism which it has so often pandered to. Tony Blair has prided himself on his ability to read public emotion and shape his government to the contours of national sentiment. This is an unreliable compass for governing, and it becomes a hopeless one when the public mood turns schizophrenic. How to explain the fact that the public were overwhelmingly on the side of the very blockaders who were making the nation's life a misery? It simply confounded the mood maestros of New Labour. One conclusion that Mr Blair can immediately draw is that the Government will never be everyone's friend. There is a slice of Britain, small and unrepresentative, but noisy and potentially dangerous, that will not be reconciled to a Labour government in any circumstances. At root, they do not believe that Labour has a right to rule. It is an offence against what they regard as the divine order. Margaret Beckett correctly identifies them as a group with a visceral hatred for the very idea that there should be a Labour government and they loathe Tony Blair all the more poisonously for being successful. In the absence of a credible electoral threat from William Hague's Conservatives, who have again looked like spectators rather than players, this Militant Tendency of the Right will take the direct action they condemned when it was practised by the Left. They will be cheered to the brink of lawlessness by elements of the media. The fickleness of the right-wing tabloids, which New Labour has devoted so much attention to wooing, has once again been demonstrated. Mob rule that they condemned when unleashed in France was egged on by the yellow press when it was practised this side of the English Channel. Big business, another constituency which New Labour has courted so assiduously, has also been exposed as a most unreliable ally in a crisis. The frustration with the fuel companies expressed by Ministers in public was the cleaned-up, expletive-deleted version of their private, spitting fury with the executives of Big Oil.

No one will think the worse of you.'</p> <p>He was Brynle Williams, 51, from nearby Cilcain, a farmer's union activist who runs a 200-acre farm and gets up at dawn to feed his cattle and sheep. His father's father was a farmer. His first language is Welsh. He was about to bring Britain to a shuddering halt.</p> <p>Around him were faces full of determination and others full of doubt. Not all were sure they were prepared to leave, within hours, to blockade Britain's largest oil refinery. Yet, despite his ultimatum, no one moved.</p> <p>Williams looked round, nodded slowly and then spelled out the gravity of the task. They would be fighting the Government, he said, not just a company. They would need the whole of the country behind them. To do that they must concentrate on just one issue. Forget BSE and the low price of milk, they were farmers' issues, Williams said. Petrol was the issue.</p> <p>The men formed a convoy, drove out of the village and headed, as dusk fell, for the Stanlow oil refinery. Few of them knew exactly what they were going to do or why. All they knew was they wanted something to change.</p> <p>Within days, Williams and his motley alliance of farmers, hauliers and fishermen were wreaking havoc throughout the nation. At the peak of the crisis on Wednesday they were calling the shots. The Government appeared powerless to do anything to stop them. A dozen reluctant activists - backed by no unions, no shadowy multimillionaires, no foreign governments and whose organisation, such as it was, didn't even have headed notepaper - were making demands on the Prime Minister. And he had to listen.</p> <p>Now the immediate crisis is over but the questions remain. How did Williams and his men do it? Can they do it again? And, if they don't, who else will? Who will be next to hold Britain to ransom?</p> <p>It seemed to come from nowhere, a sudden spasm prompted by the success of French protesters in forcing their government to make concessions over fuel taxes. But in fact it had been brewing for months or even - for farmers and hauliers - for years. After successive disasters in the beef, pig and dairy industries, high fuel prices had hit farmers hard. Hauliers too found their profits, once substantial, cut to the bone.</p> <p>The rise was stoked in part by intense market speculation on a worldwide fuel shortage and partly by the refusal of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to increase supply. With the price of a barrel of crude at a 10-year high the oil companies have passed the rise on to their customers on the forecourts.</p> <p>Calls for a cut in taxes to lessen the rises have been ignored, despite Britain having the highest fuel levies in Europe. Farmers tipping hundreds of gallons of milk on to fields and wildcat pickets of supermarkets to protest at foreign imports have barely made the local papers. A campaign last month to 'Dump The Pump' with a consumer boycott flopped in the face of public apathy. Then came the French blockade as lorry drivers cut off ports in a bid to force their government to cut taxes on fuel. The French government backed down.</p> <p>For men like Williams the lessons were obvious. The soft approach does not work, direct action does. On 4 September Welsh farmers and hauliers, including the top men from the FFA (Farmers for Action UK - a loose union of activists), met with leading politicians in Wales to talk about the crises in their industry. The meeting, in the market town of Ruthin, was inconclusive. The farmers and drivers felt their concerns were being ignored. Farmer Andrew Spence, as the FFA's regional co-ordinator for the North-East, was called by his counterpart in Cheshire and told a protest was going to be organised. Spence reached for his phone and made the first of several hundred calls.</p> <p>At 5.55am last Saturday, BA Flight 34 from Kuala Lumpur arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 4. On board was Richard Caborn, junior Minister at the Department for Trade and Industry. He drove up the M1 towards his Sheffield constituency and opened his ministerial red box. The first thing he saw, typed by his DTI civil servants, was a report on Britain's fuel crisis.</p> <p>The best case scenario, it said, was that the protests would peter out after a few ministerial pronouncements on Government willingness to listen and emphasis of the fact that fuel prices were dependent on the price of crude. In the worst case petrol stations would be shut within a week and there would be chaos. Caborn saw that there was a meeting of the Privy Council at Balmoral Castle on Monday to request emergency powers from the Queen. That was unusual, but no one in Government really believed the powers would be needed.</p> <p>Yet most people in Britain were beginning to realise something extraordinary was happening. Many viewed the pictures of hundreds of trucks blocking motorways with an odd exhilaration. There had already been two arrests and it looked like there would be more. The spectre of the 1984 miners' strike loomed large.</p> <p>This time, however, it was non-political. This was a movement - instinctive, emotional and irrational - of rural working people, small businessmen and even angry housewives, alienated by what they saw as an urban, cosmopolitan, bourgeois, distant government. Williams told The Observer the protest was not political: 'At the last general election I didn't vote. With an incoming Labour government I expected they would do more to help agriculture. But they didn't. Mr Blair has got to take stock of what the community is saying. The way he behaved in Wales with Rhodri Morgan and with the old leader of the GLC, Livingstone, makes one wonder whether he is getting a little out of touch. But I don't want to get political.'</p> <p>Even as Caborn drove up the M1, petrol stations at his destination were running out of fuel. Tanker drivers at four refineries and depots were unable, or unwilling, to take their trucks out. By that afternoon the first filling stations - in Scotland - had run out.</p> <p>What the Cabinet did not realise was the speed with which the protesters - who never numbered more than 2,500 and were led by fewer than a dozen men - could paralyse the country. Jack Straw's excuse this weekend was that it had never been done before. It hasn't. Everyone, not least the protesters, was caught by surprise.</p> <p>Using its network of regional organisers, the FFA co-ordinated lightning raids on refineries and depots across the country. Backed up by the hauliers, convoys would form, usually on a stretch of open motorway, between 10 and 15 miles from a mutually agreed target, and then descend on it.</p> <p>The blockaders were careful to stay, in the main, law-abiding. Cases of genuine harassment were rare. Though there were instances of intimidation, police say they have recorded no official complaints. At Fawley refinery near Southampton and Stanlow itself protesters and drivers chatted and shared cups of tea through the chain-link fences. Relations with the police were good. Negotiations to allow through fuel for emergency services were conducted amicably.</p> <p>But even though the routes to and from the gates were always left open - to avoid breaking the law - the pickets still formed an effective barrier. Tanker drivers seeking to leave were stopped and the drivers 'talked to' by the protesters. Most turned back, often with the support of their employers. Usually one tanker leaves the massive BP refinery in Coryton every three minutes. During the protest only one an hour got out. And they were carrying fuel for the emergency services alone. The 'blockade' consisted of about 30 protesters and eight lorries parked near a roundabout at the site entrance.</p> <p>The tanker drivers were largely on the protesters' side. 'We are in the same boat. Everyone suffers from high fuel prices,' said Chris McNamara, a London haulier. Even without that incentive, the close-knit community in which truckers live would ensure none of its members would cross a picket manned by friends and colleagues. 'At the end of the day, when this is all over, they knew they would have to share the road with us afterwards,' said John Gamble, a haulier who protested in southern England.</p> <p>The secret of success was keeping it simple. In these tight-knit professions news spreads fast. Many of the farmers were childhood friends whose families were neighbours for generations. They meet weekly in pubs, at auctions or at town meetings. Paul Ashley and Tom Houghton, the two Cheshire farmers who provided the crucial link between the agricultural community and the truckers, are very close. Houghton manages the Ashley family farm. At the Stanlow blockade they were always together. 'They are practically joined at the hip,' said one farmer.</p> <p>Mobile phones played a key part. Co-ordinating much of the protest was FFA chairman David Handley, and Williams. They ran an informal but effective 'bush telegraph'. Anyone they contacted had the numbers of a dozen other FFA supporters. And they would each have a dozen more. A single call could mobilise hundreds of people within an hour.</p> <p>Some farmers found the old ways worked best. FFA South Wales organiser, Rhys Parry, who ordered blockades throughout his region and put together a convoy encircling the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff, used word-of-mouth at livestock markets. He told The Observer: 'Farmers are the biggest gossips in the world and there is a market every day somewhere. You would just find a couple of the lads going down to one and then give them some instructions to pass on.'</p> <p>Though not as organised as the farmers, the truckers' protests and roadblocks also quickly spread. Before the sun had risen on Wednesday four columns of trucks were heading from different directions towards the capital. The first the police knew of it was when they saw the convoys crawling at 15mph, lights flashing, on CCTV cameras on motorway bridges.</p> <p>Steve Kelly was one of the organisers. He said a handful of drivers working London routes had been talking about the crisis and simply decided to act. A ring-round of colleagues took just two-and -a-half hours the next morning. The rendezvous was at 5am. By 7am they were half way into the capital.</p> <p>That evening rolling roadblocks hit roads across the UK. With refinery and depot protests still holding firm, farmers and hauliers had made a mockery of Blair's pledge - just a day earlier - to resolve the situation within 24 hours. The Government had been unable to halt the slide towards chaos.</p> <p>When Blair stood up in the State Dining Room at Downing Street on Tuesday afternoon to give that pledge in his first Prime Ministerial address to the nation, it was a blunder. He believed the oil executives would get the tankers moving. But he was wrong.</p> <p>Everything got worse. By Wednesday evening most of the tankers still hadn't budged. The reason, as far as anyone can make out, was that the tanker drivers didn't feel like driving 30,000 litres of inflammable fuel through a demonstration and out on the open roads. And the oil companies appeared to be less than keen on forcing them to.</p> <p>To many it seemed incredible that the powerful oil executives could not get their drivers to do as they asked. Critics pointed out that sending staff to work in risky environments is not exactly new to people like Shell or BP.</p> <p>Government sources briefed privately that they felt the oil companies were not pulling their weight. No one went as far as to allege conspiracy or collusion but a certain 'identity of interests' was pointed out. Pictures of protesters served with refreshments by oil companies or using their facilities only strengthened the suspicions.</p> <p>Such allegations have been fiercely denied by the oil industry. It claims it just wants to 'sell petrol'. That, however, is slightly disingenuous. Most of the oil companies' cash comes from the sale of crude oil, not finished fuel. Analysts say the companies break even when oil is $13 a barrel. When it is at $30 they make a killing.</p> <p>And while motorists pay for higher oil prices, the oil company executives have done very well. Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP, is paid \u00a31.45m each year. Thanks to soaring oil prices, BP's share price has rocketed. With 900,000 shares himself, Browne has made, on paper at least, about \u00a32m. Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Shell, owns 500,000 shares in Shell. They too have jumped in value.</p> <p>High oil prices have meant bumper profits for the companies too. In the first six months of this year BP made an incredible \u00a35.6bn - \u00a3215m per week, \u00a330m a day or \u00a33,800 a second. These are the largest ever profits made by a British corporation. BP is on track to be the first British company to make more than \u00a310bn in one financial year.</p> <p>The five oil companies who dominate world trade will make, analysts say, profits this year of around \u00a335bn. Of course, the companies say their profits from forecourt sales are tiny - just 1p in every litre. The Government's tax take is 61p.</p> <p>As most of the industry's profits come from crude oil production, some have suggested a windfall tax on that. But when Gordon Brown suggested reviewing the tax regime governing the North Sea oil industry, one of the most lenient in the world, the oil giants threatened to pull out of the North Sea, resulting in thousands of job losses. The Chancellor quietly backed off.</p> <p>Campaigners, particularly from environmental groups, point out that Lord Simon, BP's former chief executive, was a Trade Minister. BP has also seconded several employees to the Treasury, Foreign Office and DTI to help the Government with its policy formulation. The company's directors serve on a number of Government task forces. Such intimacy with the administration, campaigners say, makes a run-in with government unlikely.</p> <p>A series of misjudgments dogged the Government through the early part of the week. Blair had spent the weekend at Chequers. Most of his time was taken up dealing with the raid to free British soldiers held by rebels in Sierra Leone. Fuel took second place.</p> <p>By Sunday evening he was back at Downing Street and working in his flat. There he got a fuller briefing on what Williams, Ashley and the others had achieved. Up to 100 petrol stations had run dry, he was told. Farmers were planning to dump bales of straw in front of the Stanlow refinery. Hauliers said that up to 80 rolling roadblocks would strike in the morning.</p> <p>At 8am on Monday he phoned Jack Straw who had arrived back at his London home just an hour earlier after a long journey back from a terrorism meeting in India. Determined to get his head down for a few hours, Straw set the alarm for 11am and went to sleep.</p> <p>His daughter took the call from the Prime Minister. 'I'm afraid you'll have to get up, Dad - it's Tony Blair on the telephone,' she said.</p> <p>Blair said it was time to put crisis machinery in gear, not least to show the Government meant business. The excitement over the Sierra Leone operation had faded and a decision by Opec to pump more oil had had no impact. Action was needed.</p> <p>Straw went to work. The Home Secretary convened the Civil Contingencies Committee in the Cabinet Office Briefing Room under Downing Street. As they started their discussions, Richard Caborn had arrived at Balmoral. He was ushered into see the Queen, who agreed her Government's request for emergency powers.</p> <p>In London Blair wanted to maintain an air of calm. Cancelling engagements would only fuel panic, so he travelled to Loughborough to launch new e-commerce policies. That afternoon, in shirt sleeves in a manor house hotel, he chatted with journalists. He inserted a line into his speech making it clear the Government would not be bullied. 'We cannot and we will not alter Government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets,' he said.</p> <p>A media campaign, fronted by Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary, was launched to convince the public of the Government position. But the public didn't want to be convinced. And the fuel was running out more quickly than anyone seemed to realise.</p> <p>Straw called in Sir John Evans, Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall police, who agreed to use the police's National Reporting Centre to co-ordinate the operation to get tankers rolling again.

Handley fielded the 7,000-plus calls, passing information to group members 4. Tom Houghton, 41, farm manager, North West co-ordinator of the group. The farm he manages in Sandbach, Cheshire, for Paul Ashley (No5) has gone from making a profit four years ago, to barely breaking even due to the BSE crisis and rising fuel costs. Ashley, 42, was born on his father's farm, and when his father retired took charge. He has now diversified into timber and haulage 6. Andrew Spence, 33, sheep/beef/arable farmer, Leadgate, Co Durham. Ran a haulage business that went bankrupt during BSE crisis. Arrested amid angry scenes as tankers left the BP, Texaco and Fina depot in Sunderland, and later charged with obstruction 7.

No one will think the worse of you.' He was Brynle Williams, 51, from nearby Cilcain, a farmer's union activist who runs a 200-acre farm and gets up at dawn to feed his cattle and sheep. His father's father was a farmer. His first language is Welsh. He was about to bring Britain to a shuddering halt. Around him were faces full of determination and others full of doubt. Not all were sure they were prepared to leave, within hours, to blockade Britain's largest oil refinery. Yet, despite his ultimatum, no one moved. Williams looked round, nodded slowly and then spelled out the gravity of the task. They would be fighting the Government, he said, not just a company. They would need the whole of the country behind them. To do that they must concentrate on just one issue. Forget BSE and the low price of milk, they were farmers' issues, Williams said. Petrol was the issue. The men formed a convoy, drove out of the village and headed, as dusk fell, for the Stanlow oil refinery. Few of them knew exactly what they were going to do or why. All they knew was they wanted something to change. Within days, Williams and his motley alliance of farmers, hauliers and fishermen were wreaking havoc throughout the nation. At the peak of the crisis on Wednesday they were calling the shots. The Government appeared powerless to do anything to stop them. A dozen reluctant activists - backed by no unions, no shadowy multimillionaires, no foreign governments and whose organisation, such as it was, didn't even have headed notepaper - were making demands on the Prime Minister. And he had to listen. Now the immediate crisis is over but the questions remain. How did Williams and his men do it? Can they do it again? And, if they don't, who else will? Who will be next to hold Britain to ransom? It seemed to come from nowhere, a sudden spasm prompted by the success of French protesters in forcing their government to make concessions over fuel taxes. But in fact it had been brewing for months or even - for farmers and hauliers - for years. After successive disasters in the beef, pig and dairy industries, high fuel prices had hit farmers hard. Hauliers too found their profits, once substantial, cut to the bone. The rise was stoked in part by intense market speculation on a worldwide fuel shortage and partly by the refusal of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to increase supply. With the price of a barrel of crude at a 10-year high the oil companies have passed the rise on to their customers on the forecourts. Calls for a cut in taxes to lessen the rises have been ignored, despite Britain having the highest fuel levies in Europe. Farmers tipping hundreds of gallons of milk on to fields and wildcat pickets of supermarkets to protest at foreign imports have barely made the local papers. A campaign last month to 'Dump The Pump' with a consumer boycott flopped in the face of public apathy. Then came the French blockade as lorry drivers cut off ports in a bid to force their government to cut taxes on fuel. The French government backed down. For men like Williams the lessons were obvious. The soft approach does not work, direct action does. On 4 September Welsh farmers and hauliers, including the top men from the FFA (Farmers for Action UK - a loose union of activists), met with leading politicians in Wales to talk about the crises in their industry. The meeting, in the market town of Ruthin, was inconclusive. The farmers and drivers felt their concerns were being ignored. Farmer Andrew Spence, as the FFA's regional co-ordinator for the North-East, was called by his counterpart in Cheshire and told a protest was going to be organised. Spence reached for his phone and made the first of several hundred calls. At 5.55am last Saturday, BA Flight 34 from Kuala Lumpur arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 4. On board was Richard Caborn, junior Minister at the Department for Trade and Industry. He drove up the M1 towards his Sheffield constituency and opened his ministerial red box. The first thing he saw, typed by his DTI civil servants, was a report on Britain's fuel crisis. The best case scenario, it said, was that the protests would peter out after a few ministerial pronouncements on Government willingness to listen and emphasis of the fact that fuel prices were dependent on the price of crude. In the worst case petrol stations would be shut within a week and there would be chaos. Caborn saw that there was a meeting of the Privy Council at Balmoral Castle on Monday to request emergency powers from the Queen. That was unusual, but no one in Government really believed the powers would be needed. Yet most people in Britain were beginning to realise something extraordinary was happening. Many viewed the pictures of hundreds of trucks blocking motorways with an odd exhilaration. There had already been two arrests and it looked like there would be more. The spectre of the 1984 miners' strike loomed large. This time, however, it was non-political. This was a movement - instinctive, emotional and irrational - of rural working people, small businessmen and even angry housewives, alienated by what they saw as an urban, cosmopolitan, bourgeois, distant government. Williams told The Observer the protest was not political: 'At the last general election I didn't vote. With an incoming Labour government I expected they would do more to help agriculture. But they didn't. Mr Blair has got to take stock of what the community is saying. The way he behaved in Wales with Rhodri Morgan and with the old leader of the GLC, Livingstone, makes one wonder whether he is getting a little out of touch. But I don't want to get political.' Even as Caborn drove up the M1, petrol stations at his destination were running out of fuel. Tanker drivers at four refineries and depots were unable, or unwilling, to take their trucks out. By that afternoon the first filling stations - in Scotland - had run out. What the Cabinet did not realise was the speed with which the protesters - who never numbered more than 2,500 and were led by fewer than a dozen men - could paralyse the country. Jack Straw's excuse this weekend was that it had never been done before. It hasn't. Everyone, not least the protesters, was caught by surprise. Using its network of regional organisers, the FFA co-ordinated lightning raids on refineries and depots across the country. Backed up by the hauliers, convoys would form, usually on a stretch of open motorway, between 10 and 15 miles from a mutually agreed target, and then descend on it. The blockaders were careful to stay, in the main, law-abiding. Cases of genuine harassment were rare. Though there were instances of intimidation, police say they have recorded no official complaints. At Fawley refinery near Southampton and Stanlow itself protesters and drivers chatted and shared cups of tea through the chain-link fences. Relations with the police were good. Negotiations to allow through fuel for emergency services were conducted amicably. But even though the routes to and from the gates were always left open - to avoid breaking the law - the pickets still formed an effective barrier. Tanker drivers seeking to leave were stopped and the drivers 'talked to' by the protesters. Most turned back, often with the support of their employers. Usually one tanker leaves the massive BP refinery in Coryton every three minutes. During the protest only one an hour got out. And they were carrying fuel for the emergency services alone. The 'blockade' consisted of about 30 protesters and eight lorries parked near a roundabout at the site entrance. The tanker drivers were largely on the protesters' side. 'We are in the same boat. Everyone suffers from high fuel prices,' said Chris McNamara, a London haulier. Even without that incentive, the close-knit community in which truckers live would ensure none of its members would cross a picket manned by friends and colleagues. 'At the end of the day, when this is all over, they knew they would have to share the road with us afterwards,' said John Gamble, a haulier who protested in southern England. The secret of success was keeping it simple. In these tight-knit professions news spreads fast. Many of the farmers were childhood friends whose families were neighbours for generations. They meet weekly in pubs, at auctions or at town meetings. Paul Ashley and Tom Houghton, the two Cheshire farmers who provided the crucial link between the agricultural community and the truckers, are very close. Houghton manages the Ashley family farm. At the Stanlow blockade they were always together. 'They are practically joined at the hip,' said one farmer. Mobile phones played a key part. Co-ordinating much of the protest was FFA chairman David Handley, and Williams. They ran an informal but effective 'bush telegraph'. Anyone they contacted had the numbers of a dozen other FFA supporters. And they would each have a dozen more. A single call could mobilise hundreds of people within an hour. Some farmers found the old ways worked best. FFA South Wales organiser, Rhys Parry, who ordered blockades throughout his region and put together a convoy encircling the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff, used word-of-mouth at livestock markets. He told The Observer: 'Farmers are the biggest gossips in the world and there is a market every day somewhere. You would just find a couple of the lads going down to one and then give them some instructions to pass on.' Though not as organised as the farmers, the truckers' protests and roadblocks also quickly spread. Before the sun had risen on Wednesday four columns of trucks were heading from different directions towards the capital. The first the police knew of it was when they saw the convoys crawling at 15mph, lights flashing, on CCTV cameras on motorway bridges. Steve Kelly was one of the organisers. He said a handful of drivers working London routes had been talking about the crisis and simply decided to act. A ring-round of colleagues took just two-and -a-half hours the next morning. The rendezvous was at 5am. By 7am they were half way into the capital. That evening rolling roadblocks hit roads across the UK. With refinery and depot protests still holding firm, farmers and hauliers had made a mockery of Blair's pledge - just a day earlier - to resolve the situation within 24 hours. The Government had been unable to halt the slide towards chaos. When Blair stood up in the State Dining Room at Downing Street on Tuesday afternoon to give that pledge in his first Prime Ministerial address to the nation, it was a blunder. He believed the oil executives would get the tankers moving. But he was wrong. Everything got worse. By Wednesday evening most of the tankers still hadn't budged. The reason, as far as anyone can make out, was that the tanker drivers didn't feel like driving 30,000 litres of inflammable fuel through a demonstration and out on the open roads. And the oil companies appeared to be less than keen on forcing them to. To many it seemed incredible that the powerful oil executives could not get their drivers to do as they asked. Critics pointed out that sending staff to work in risky environments is not exactly new to people like Shell or BP. Government sources briefed privately that they felt the oil companies were not pulling their weight. No one went as far as to allege conspiracy or collusion but a certain 'identity of interests' was pointed out. Pictures of protesters served with refreshments by oil companies or using their facilities only strengthened the suspicions. Such allegations have been fiercely denied by the oil industry. It claims it just wants to 'sell petrol'. That, however, is slightly disingenuous. Most of the oil companies' cash comes from the sale of crude oil, not finished fuel. Analysts say the companies break even when oil is $13 a barrel. When it is at $30 they make a killing. And while motorists pay for higher oil prices, the oil company executives have done very well. Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP, is paid \u00a31.45m each year. Thanks to soaring oil prices, BP's share price has rocketed. With 900,000 shares himself, Browne has made, on paper at least, about \u00a32m. Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Shell, owns 500,000 shares in Shell. They too have jumped in value. High oil prices have meant bumper profits for the companies too. In the first six months of this year BP made an incredible \u00a35.6bn - \u00a3215m per week, \u00a330m a day or \u00a33,800 a second. These are the largest ever profits made by a British corporation. BP is on track to be the first British company to make more than \u00a310bn in one financial year. The five oil companies who dominate world trade will make, analysts say, profits this year of around \u00a335bn. Of course, the companies say their profits from forecourt sales are tiny - just 1p in every litre. The Government's tax take is 61p. As most of the industry's profits come from crude oil production, some have suggested a windfall tax on that. But when Gordon Brown suggested reviewing the tax regime governing the North Sea oil industry, one of the most lenient in the world, the oil giants threatened to pull out of the North Sea, resulting in thousands of job losses. The Chancellor quietly backed off. Campaigners, particularly from environmental groups, point out that Lord Simon, BP's former chief executive, was a Trade Minister. BP has also seconded several employees to the Treasury, Foreign Office and DTI to help the Government with its policy formulation. The company's directors serve on a number of Government task forces. Such intimacy with the administration, campaigners say, makes a run-in with government unlikely. A series of misjudgments dogged the Government through the early part of the week. Blair had spent the weekend at Chequers. Most of his time was taken up dealing with the raid to free British soldiers held by rebels in Sierra Leone. Fuel took second place. By Sunday evening he was back at Downing Street and working in his flat. There he got a fuller briefing on what Williams, Ashley and the others had achieved. Up to 100 petrol stations had run dry, he was told. Farmers were planning to dump bales of straw in front of the Stanlow refinery. Hauliers said that up to 80 rolling roadblocks would strike in the morning. At 8am on Monday he phoned Jack Straw who had arrived back at his London home just an hour earlier after a long journey back from a terrorism meeting in India. Determined to get his head down for a few hours, Straw set the alarm for 11am and went to sleep. His daughter took the call from the Prime Minister. 'I'm afraid you'll have to get up, Dad - it's Tony Blair on the telephone,' she said. Blair said it was time to put crisis machinery in gear, not least to show the Government meant business. The excitement over the Sierra Leone operation had faded and a decision by Opec to pump more oil had had no impact. Action was needed. Straw went to work. The Home Secretary convened the Civil Contingencies Committee in the Cabinet Office Briefing Room under Downing Street. As they started their discussions, Richard Caborn had arrived at Balmoral. He was ushered into see the Queen, who agreed her Government's request for emergency powers. In London Blair wanted to maintain an air of calm. Cancelling engagements would only fuel panic, so he travelled to Loughborough to launch new e-commerce policies. That afternoon, in shirt sleeves in a manor house hotel, he chatted with journalists. He inserted a line into his speech making it clear the Government would not be bullied. 'We cannot and we will not alter Government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets,' he said. A media campaign, fronted by Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary, was launched to convince the public of the Government position. But the public didn't want to be convinced. And the fuel was running out more quickly than anyone seemed to realise. Straw called in Sir John Evans, Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall police, who agreed to use the police's National Reporting Centre to co-ordinate the operation to get tankers rolling again. The centre has three states of alert. Gold, silver and bronze. They went immediately to gold. That evening Blair was advised by Hull police not to attend John Prescott's celebration of 30 years in parliament at Mr Chu's Chinese restaurant in Hull. But still, with the crisis team in place and the oil executives seemingly aware of the seriousness of the issue, Tuesday dawned with Blair believing he had things under control. That was when he made his ill-fated 24-hour pledge. A day later, as his deadline grew close, Britain was running dry. The post was hit. Stricken firms were beginning to lay off staff . William Hague demanded the immediate recall of Parliament. Blair started playing hardball. Denouncing the protesters for doing 'real damage to real people', he put the NHS on red alert. 'Lives are at risk if these people cannot get to work,' he said. The situation looked bleak. On Wednesday morning an incredulous country woke to hear the army was being mobilised. Funeral directors said they only had petrol to pick up bodies from houses, not bury them. Ambulance services imposed speed limits. Supermarkets started running out of food. Castastrophe seemed imminent. But it didn't happen. The country woke to another day of madness on Thursday - then, suddenly, it was over. The shortages remained - and are likely to remain for up to two weeks - but the blockades were gone. At 5am Brynle Williams stood on the back of a trailer in the cool, grey dawn and announced the end of the Stanlow blockade. Half an hour later Scottish protesters at Grangemouth voted to lift their blockade. Crucial negotiations by senior trade unionists had been key in securing their decision. Within minutes the first tankers left the refinery and headed for petrol stations. At 8am the protest at Avonmouth ended. A convoy of eight tankers left the plant with the drivers waving at the cheering demonstrators. By mid-morning the protests in Essex, Nottingham and Plymouth were over too. The protesters at the Conoco Ocean terminal in Lincolnshire ended their protest at 11am. Feelings were mixed. A rump of protesters at Fawley and Jarrow rejected the FFA's decision. At Trafford in Manchester one of the main organisers, Dave Neave, a farmer from Rochdale, broke down in tears of frustration. All over the country the protests unravelled. There was a last sting in the tail when Esso and TotalFinaElf tried to raise prices by 2p a litre but they were forced to back down by a furious Blair. An odd calm settled. It is now officially over.

      "body": "<p>'So,' successive interviewers triumphantly put to Ministers, 'you didn't see it coming. Why didn't you anticipate what would happen?' The truth is that nobody in a London-centred political and media world saw the scale of what was coming - even if in the north of England and Scotland last weekend word was spreading fast that you had better fill your tank. As for the idea that by last Wednesday the country would face breakdown - not even the protesters expected such a devastating result so soon. We were all blindsided.</p> <p>What had not been appreciated was the fragility of an economy made extraordinarily interdependent because so many organisations carry astonishingly few reserves. Rather than tie up money in carrying 'dead' stock, supermarkets and petrol stations rely on a system of 'just-in-time' delivery - depending on daily and sometimes even more frequent deliveries to keep their shelves and underground tanks stocked. Fine if the lorries and tankers keep on coming. Disastrous if they don't for two or three days.</p> <p>This alone would not have been enough to create a national crisis; after all, Britain has some 50 oil supply depots, and not even the miners succeeded in picketing them effectively. Here the lesson is that old organisational forms have been succeeded by a new conception: the network. Intellectuals theorising about the impact of information technology have been arguing for some years that the office and factory are giving way to the network as the new prime organisational form. The mobile telephone and internet underpin a new capacity to communicate that make all organisations more porous; and individuals can coalesce around common aims while never actually meeting. One in 17 British workers now 'teleworks' from home. One in 10 Londoners works as a free agent.</p> <p>There have been warnings over the emergence of networks as the new organisational force. The police found they could not trace the email and website-linked network behind the J18 rioters in the City last year. But nobody imagined a group of farmers, road hauliers and taxi drivers could deploy networking capacity to such destructive effect. Brynle Williams, the Welsh farmer who led the trigger protest at Stanlow, acknowledged he was not part of a national campaigning organisation, but 'a network of like-minded people'.</p> <p>It is this dimension of the crisis with which the Government's task force, led by Jack Straw, must wrestle if it is to counteract a second blockade. The authorities are not confronting members of a body like the National Union of Mineworkers whose phones can be tapped, communications monitored and movements watched. They are confronting a network whose co-ordinating centre is constantly changing and linked by a myriad of mobile phones, CB radios, in-cab fax machines and laptops .</p> <p>So, just-in-time delivery and the network - two new organisational forms - interacted to produce a very 21st- century crisis which will require completely new thinking to manage if it recurs. Once it became clear on Monday morning that the blockades were proving so effective, the network was able to mobilise sympathisers in the rest of the country, so by Monday afternoon the oil companies were issuing warnings that petrol stations would run dry. That, in turn, prompted the panic buying, emptying petrol stations even faster. It was a frightening, almost surreal lurch from normality to disaster in 24 hours.</p> <p>Yet the protest was largely peaceful. Some 2,000 protesters could only request tanker drivers to stop, in order to argue their case, if the drivers had pre-agreed to show their manifests, demonstrating that they were going to deliver to emergency services. When they did stop, the protesters could exercise a right of veto over who and what constituted an emergency service, one of the ugliest dimensions of the crisis. But if the drivers refused to comply with the request, they were free to come and go. One of the more perplexing aspects of the crisis was why that right was not exercised; after all, tankers and lorries had moved through NUM and Wapping picket lines in the 1980s. Why were the drivers so reluctant in 2000?</p> <p>Part of the explanation is a genuine fear of intimidation, with threats to put offending drivers' pictures on the internet. But by far the most important explanation is that the oil companies have contracted out their petrol delivery to low-cost independent road hauliers who sympathised with the protesters' cause and over whom the oil companies had little leverage. They weren't prepared to take any risks, and offered no loyalty because no reciprocal loyalty had been displayed by the companies in their ceaseless drive for cost minimisation. Some drivers had even been sacked to be re-employed as independents for less pay.</p> <p>In other words, the new mania to maximise shareholder value above any other strategic corporate objective has exposed the whole delivery and supply system to the kind of shock the country experienced last week. If the Government wants more protection against a repeat, it will need to calm down the British corporate sectors' increasing preoccupation with profit and self-interest.</p> <p>There is the issue of how debate and protest are to be handled in an information age in which the electorate is better educated, more articulate and insistent on having its voice heard than ever before - and where trust in old forms of governance is declining. Here there were ominous parallels with the way the public reacted to the News of the World 's name-and-shame paedophiles campaign. Not trusting the Government to act and barely understanding the complexities, we witnessed the return of vigilante justice.</p> <p>The background to the blockade has been a similar, over-the-top campaign by the Sun and Daily Mail - 'Dump the Pump' - in which the Government has been made to look a fool and knave over its allegedly uncaring attitude to Britain's high taxes on fuel. That taxes overall are low, that there are no road tolls and that there is a democratic process by which taxes are determined has been neglected. There must be action on the streets. 'Dump the Pump' may have been a flop, but there is little doubt that the degree of tacit support the protesters received was helped by the widespread view, entrenched by the campaign, that fuel taxes are illegitimately too high. If the Government is not 'listening', i.e. caving in, then anybody has the right to act as they see fit. It is the road to anarchy.</p> <p>But the Government has helped create this situation by its own unwillingness to lead. New Labour has not wanted to argue that taxation is the platform for the expenditure the electorate wants.</p> <p>Last week it received its comeuppance.

Incitement or reportage? At least the Mail knew what was happening before it happened and saw it ending when it did. At least Blair was warned. Does this mean that its subsequent lather about 'the unprecedented Europeanisation of British politics, now uncannily reminiscent of the elitist bureaucracy in France' is right, too? Pass on such old siren songs. The quieter lessons of tumult past are probably more salient. That when people see TV pictures of empty filling stations, they go and fill up. That a mobile phone and an email leaves Arthur Scargill for dead - and reporters out of the loop. That green, alas, will not be the colour of next year's Budget. And that a press which doesn't like a tough issue can always find softer ones. Thus the journals that were weaker on Wapping were ramrod here. Thus the lions of law and order licked their paws. Other boots, other feet; much kicking up of dust. But another power-crazed press plot against our elected masters? Give over - even if the Sun has suddenly found its bombastic voice again. This cacophony couldn't organise a sandwich supper in El Vino's.",

      "body": "<p>Wearing a public mien of calm, on Monday 21 December, Peter Mandelson went down to Greenwich for an inspection tour of the Millennium Dome, which was soon interrupted by urgent instructions to talk to Downing Street. Back at No 10, Derry Irvine and Charlie Falconer, the lawyers of the Blair court, were brought into the discussions with Campbell about how to try to control the loan story. At this meeting, Jonathan Powell produced a note from Sir Richard Wilson. After talking to the DTI's Permanent Secretary Sir Michael Scholar, the Cabinet Secretary confirmed that Mandelson had been properly insulated from the DTI inquiries into Robinson. But both the civil servants also took the view - which Wilson conveyed to Blair - that for Mandelson to be so hugely and secretly indebted to the Paymaster-General was nevertheless 'a very big problem'.</p> <p>On Monday afternoon, the Guardian formally approached Mandelson and Robinson for confirmation of the details of the loan. Into the placidity of the Christmas recess, a period usually devoid of big political events, the bomb detonated.</p> <p>A strangely unperturbed Mandelson convinced himself he could walk through the fire. Blair was instinctively and immediately doubtful that he could possibly survive what he and Campbell both knew would be an inferno. The press secretary briefed political correspondents that the Prime Minister did not regard it as 'a hanging offence', which fell far short of a ringing statement of confidence.</p> <p>For the next 24 hours, beginning with Monday's Newsnight, on which he declared, 'There is no conflict of interest so the question of resignation does not arise', Mandelson toured the TV and radio studios, determined to tough it out. As he told one friend: 'I've learnt from my personal life that you have to stand up to these fuckers. If they scent blood, they will come for the kill.'</p> <p>But the more Mandelson talked, the more questions were raised. Should he have declared the loan in the Register of Members' Interests? Had he revealed the loan to the Britannia Building Society when he applied for a mortgage? After a period of equivocation, Mandelson confessed that he had not. Wegg-Prosser was alerted to this deadly question on Monday night during a conversation with Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror. Mandelson's own aide concluded then that his master could not survive. 'Peter's finished,' Wegg-Prosser told one of Blair's aides. 'It's the size of it,' was Blair's private verdict to aides and officials about why the loan was so devastating. For the price of Mandelson's house in an elite enclave of west London could be bought a street of homes in his constituency of Hartlepool.</p> <p>Blair's initial prognosis that Mandelson was not to be saved was hardening by Tuesday morning into a certainty that he had to be severed. Alastair Campbell, thinking the media would never let go until Mandelson resigned, and Anji Hunter, protective of Blair's reputation, were both urging the Prime Minister to dispatch the Trade and Industry Secretary. Blair turned to another confidant for advice. He rang Philip Gould, who was spending Christmas in Jamaica. As warm as the weather was in the Caribbean, Blair's chilly fury transmitted itself down the line. 'Why aren't you here when I need you?' Blair snapped. Gould, while registering Blair's shock and anger, attempted to offer pleas in mitigation. After everything Mandelson had done to create New Labour, should he have his five-month career in the Cabinet terminated? 'You should hold on to Peter. You shouldn't give in to our enemies,' Gould argued. 'If you let Peter go, you'll be weakened.' Blair perceived that, but he saw himself and the Government being more damaged by letting Mandelson hang on. In response to Gould's entreaties to save Mandelson, Blair was stony: 'Look. Read the papers, Philip. Think again.' The phone went down.</p> <p>Blair had retired to Chequers when, at 10 on the night of Tuesday 22 December, he talked again to the man whose skills once so mesmerised him. Blair was not good at breaking bad news. He particularly did not relish telling a friend as old and as close as Mandelson that he wanted him gone. He allowed the other man to lead the conversation, asking for his own assessment. Mandelson still believed himself to be the victim of a 'stitch-up' by the Brownites. The press were 'completely hysterical' and 'out of control'. He had made a mistake, he was prepared to admit that now. Yet he clung to the belief that he could and must remain in the Cabinet.</p> <p>Mandelson did float the idea that he might have to resign. By describing this as 'very painful', he evidently hoped that Blair would respond by dismissing the idea. The words that would have been music for him were the Prime Minister saying that he wasn't going to sacrifice him under pressure from the media, and that the No 10 propaganda organ would be pumped to save him. How Blair replied was therefore a crushing disappointment. He told Mandelson that they should 'sleep on it'. Such an expert reader of the codes of political conversation grasped what Blair was semaphoring.

      "bodyText": "Wearing a public mien of calm, on Monday 21 December, Peter Mandelson went down to Greenwich for an inspection tour of the Millennium Dome, which was soon interrupted by urgent instructions to talk to Downing Street. Back at No 10, Derry Irvine and Charlie Falconer, the lawyers of the Blair court, were brought into the discussions with Campbell about how to try to control the loan story. At this meeting, Jonathan Powell produced a note from Sir Richard Wilson. After talking to the DTI's Permanent Secretary Sir Michael Scholar, the Cabinet Secretary confirmed that Mandelson had been properly insulated from the DTI inquiries into Robinson. But both the civil servants also took the view - which Wilson conveyed to Blair - that for Mandelson to be so hugely and secretly indebted to the Paymaster-General was nevertheless 'a very big problem'. On Monday afternoon, the Guardian formally approached Mandelson and Robinson for confirmation of the details of the loan. Into the placidity of the Christmas recess, a period usually devoid of big political events, the bomb detonated. A strangely unperturbed Mandelson convinced himself he could walk through the fire. Blair was instinctively and immediately doubtful that he could possibly survive what he and Campbell both knew would be an inferno. The press secretary briefed political correspondents that the Prime Minister did not regard it as 'a hanging offence', which fell far short of a ringing statement of confidence. For the next 24 hours, beginning with Monday's Newsnight, on which he declared, 'There is no conflict of interest so the question of resignation does not arise', Mandelson toured the TV and radio studios, determined to tough it out. As he told one friend: 'I've learnt from my personal life that you have to stand up to these fuckers. If they scent blood, they will come for the kill.' But the more Mandelson talked, the more questions were raised. Should he have declared the loan in the Register of Members' Interests? Had he revealed the loan to the Britannia Building Society when he applied for a mortgage? After a period of equivocation, Mandelson confessed that he had not. Wegg-Prosser was alerted to this deadly question on Monday night during a conversation with Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror. Mandelson's own aide concluded then that his master could not survive. 'Peter's finished,' Wegg-Prosser told one of Blair's aides. 'It's the size of it,' was Blair's private verdict to aides and officials about why the loan was so devastating. For the price of Mandelson's house in an elite enclave of west London could be bought a street of homes in his constituency of Hartlepool. Blair's initial prognosis that Mandelson was not to be saved was hardening by Tuesday morning into a certainty that he had to be severed. Alastair Campbell, thinking the media would never let go until Mandelson resigned, and Anji Hunter, protective of Blair's reputation, were both urging the Prime Minister to dispatch the Trade and Industry Secretary. Blair turned to another confidant for advice. He rang Philip Gould, who was spending Christmas in Jamaica. As warm as the weather was in the Caribbean, Blair's chilly fury transmitted itself down the line. 'Why aren't you here when I need you?' Blair snapped. Gould, while registering Blair's shock and anger, attempted to offer pleas in mitigation. After everything Mandelson had done to create New Labour, should he have his five-month career in the Cabinet terminated? 'You should hold on to Peter. You shouldn't give in to our enemies,' Gould argued. 'If you let Peter go, you'll be weakened.' Blair perceived that, but he saw himself and the Government being more damaged by letting Mandelson hang on. In response to Gould's entreaties to save Mandelson, Blair was stony: 'Look. Read the papers, Philip. Think again.' The phone went down. Blair had retired to Chequers when, at 10 on the night of Tuesday 22 December, he talked again to the man whose skills once so mesmerised him. Blair was not good at breaking bad news. He particularly did not relish telling a friend as old and as close as Mandelson that he wanted him gone. He allowed the other man to lead the conversation, asking for his own assessment. Mandelson still believed himself to be the victim of a 'stitch-up' by the Brownites. The press were 'completely hysterical' and 'out of control'. He had made a mistake, he was prepared to admit that now. Yet he clung to the belief that he could and must remain in the Cabinet. Mandelson did float the idea that he might have to resign. By describing this as 'very painful', he evidently hoped that Blair would respond by dismissing the idea. The words that would have been music for him were the Prime Minister saying that he wasn't going to sacrifice him under pressure from the media, and that the No 10 propaganda organ would be pumped to save him. How Blair replied was therefore a crushing disappointment. He told Mandelson that they should 'sleep on it'. Such an expert reader of the codes of political conversation grasped what Blair was semaphoring. The Prime Minister and those advising him wanted to see the following morning's newspapers before they made a final decision. The press was savage, though not unanimously so. The Guardian, the paper that broke the story, pronounced him guilty of 'more vanity than venality' and judged that resignation would be a sentence out of proportion to the crime. The Sun, which Mandelson once so assiduously courted, had gone down on him. The tabloid shrieked: 'So How The Hell Can Mandy Stay?' There were ironies to be savoured. Among the people whom Mandelson had cultivated was Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of the man who owned the Sun. Even now, a large percentage of Mandelson believed he could yet save his place in the Cabinet. At seven on Wednesday morning he phoned Wegg-Prosser to tell him to organise a 'fight-back' meeting at the DTI with Campbell, his deputy, Lance Price, and Jonathan Powell.
